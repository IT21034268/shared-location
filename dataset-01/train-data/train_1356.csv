3,Not what I expected.,"I bought this expecting that it would allow me to play CDRW's. Not only is it skipping on my CDRW's, it's even worse on CDR's! Cd's play great, I haven't had a problem. It never skips on regular cd's. The volume is not as loud as I wanted, but would be fine for the average person. I'm going to try buying more expensive CDR's and CDRW's to see if that makes a difference. If anyone finds a brand that works very well, feel free to tell me at tcisler@hotmail.com ."
4,Hammel continues his saga of fighter pilots,"Once again, Hammel has found the right mix of in-the-cockpit action and background data. His writing is concise and to the point, but that just makes it easy to read and enjoy. For the armchair fighter pilot, Hammel's four books on aces are an investment not to miss."
5,Julie Newmar,"I liked the Monkees, but the reason I bought the tape was to have it autographed by Julie Newmar.The film was still fun to watch.If you are not familiar with the Monkess they were like the Beatles meet the Marx Brothers.Not genius, but still fun."
5,Living With Teenagers,I found this book to be excellent. I have 2 teenagers and the book really enlightened me on a number of things. I thought I was the only one with the issues in the book so I felt so good to know the things I am going through are very common with teenagers. I recommend this book for anyone with a teenager.
2,You can't learn how to parent from a book,"Well, I thought I'd get a lot out of this book, all I really learned is you can't control people and you can't learn how to parent from reading a book.Most of his examples were realistic of interactions with teens, but his follow through on how to deal with these issues was weak. His approach is less is more. Don't argue with them, tell them what is expected.He covers the high points, but you really can't learn how to relate to people via a book.If you truly have problems with your teens and stepkids...go to see a counselor with them. You'd be amazed what they will say when a third party is present that they won't talk about at home."
2,Get Out of My Life but First Could You Drive Me and Cheryl to the Mall?: A Parent's Guide to the New Teenager,"I would give the title 5 stars and I agree with the majority of reviewers that it is comforting reading another parenting book that explains seemingly outrageous behavior. The major disappointment was the advice for how to deal with problems that may range from upsetting to dangerous. Dr.Wolf's ""solutions"" can be summed up with a quote from the chapter ""Conflict"" in which a parent tells his child ""You are going to have to learn that what you do and say has consequences."" Dr. Wolf advises ""The parent may say this and may indeed punish a child for disrespect. What punishment accomplishes, as anybody who has been through this will attest, is nothing. Nothing positive, that is. The same thing will happen again anyway."" If that fits your parenting philosophy, you will probably enjoy the book. I hope this is not what the majority of parents believe, much less ""anybody who has been through this""."
4,A good conversation starter.,"I liked the book. It gave my wife and I a starting point for trying to understand our first teenager's behavior. It's main point is that being a teenager today is different than when we were 14, and understanding where they are coming from can help us deal with behaviors that were totally unacceptable from us at 14. If you want a ""Do this...."" sort of book you will be disappointed. It offers a point of view that we didn't necessarily agree with 100%, but it helped us to find what we do agree on."
5,Keep this book handy at all times to prove you're not crazy!,"How do you love this ""new"" person who comes into your home and disrupts everything in your life? Dr. Wolf does a wonderful job of calming frazzled parents and letting us know there is light at the end of the tunnel. He gives practical advice on how to help a teen make the difficult transition into adulthood. We are not perfect parents, but this book is helping us maintain a loving, nurturing relationship with our teen."
4,Comforting advice about normal teenage behavior,"This book assures parents of today's teenagers that their difficult experiences with their children are not unusual. It gives good examples of how to respond to the child's complaints without getting into an argument. It accepts the principle that the parent is the authority whether the child likes it or not, but it does not expect absolute obedience from the child. I thought the book was a little weak when discussing alcohol, drugs, and sex. These potentially deadly problems were dealt with a little too casually. Overall, I thought the book was very comforting."
4,The Clinton Years:; The Photographs of Robert McNeely,"Like him, love him, or hate him, few could deny that Mr. Clinton is an interesting and complex individual. President Clinton's need for and ease with personal contact with practically any person comes through loud and clear through these behind-the-scenes photos of Robert McNeely. Clinton's comfort with small children and world leaders comes through wordlessly in these photographs and they present a different view of Bill Clinton's political life and presidency heretofore not seen in the media. I believe this coffee table book of photographs would make interesting viewing and reading for anyone who, like me, is intrigued about a person who became President."
4,The Spirit of America,"Clinton was a master politician and is a captivating human being. A revealing picture in the book, from a European perspective: Queen Elizabeth, Francois Mitterand and Bill Clinton at Omaha Beach, 50 years hence. What a contrast between fossilized 0ld World splendour and the disarming mixture of boyishness and high seriousness embodied by Clinton! If that is the spirit of America, then I'm envious of it ..."
3,An incomplete look at his 8 years,"The pictures are wonderfully done - great shots of the president trying to do his job. However the book itself is incomplete - any book (picture book or novel) which omits references to his many scandals (his impeachment, Monica Lewinsky, lying under oath, the last-second pardons of criminals, WhiteWater, losing his license to practice law in Arkansas) misses the most significant parts of his presidency and paints only half the picture."
1,Don't Get Me Started!,I just don't like Clinton! He is definitely a Nicolae Carpathia through and through I can't believe there are mindless people who worship this guy. Clinton could start his only religious sect! Clintonism!
3,interesting...,"I bought this album because i saw it in a bin of CDs for 99 cents at FYE a couple days ago... so i was like ""hmm.. this looks interesting, im gonna get it"" i had never heard of them... didnt even know if the name of the band was Cakewalk or A house of freaks! but i took it home and listened to it expecting it to be crap... but it was actually pretty good. Some of the songs are enjoyable to listen to... the only one i have trouble with is Ants because the constant mention of bugs is just... ugh, intolerable."
2,Barely made it out of the box,"I had high hopes for this toy. My daughter fancies herself as an artist, so I thought this would be great. I WAS WRONG! This toy is very flimsy. The pieces fell apart almost immediately. It is definitely not worth the money. It never stood upright as an easel. I was very disappointed."
2,Disappointed Mom,"I was very excited when I first purchased this product because my 3 year old son loves to paint. Unfortunately, the plastic and workmanship is so cheap, it broke the first time I tried to set it up. I do not recommend buying this product."
3,"it is good,but it is a little bit boring","i am not saying that is worth,but,it is good is not the best toy but,it is a fun and creative toy"
3,"Little of the life, much of the thought","This work traces the development of Engels thought, and focuses on his relation to, and contribution to the work of Marx. It is very skimpy on the life of Engels and does not provide any real understanding of his psychology. We do not get to feel the kind of person he is. The son of a rich industrialist he very early on became committed to Socialism. In meeting Marx he recognized someone who was his intellectual superior. Their collaboration and friendship involved also Engels promotion of the ideas and thought of Marx. Engels wrote multiple book- reviews at the publication of ' Kapital' and worked industriously to help Marx's ideas penetrate Western society."
4,Great Christian read,This book took me longer to get through then most books but it was very well written and funny. It was hard for me to like Susannah throughout most of the book but at the end she gets a good dose of character. I loved that it was set in the south! I definatly suggest reading this book.
3,Suprised to find this to be a Christian book.,"I had no idea when I purchased this book that it was Christian in any way, but there is no doubt now that I have finished it that there is definately a southern Christian influence. Don't get me wrong I liked the book and I am a Christian myself I was just suprised to find it to be such when nothing I read indicated that it was. Good romance story not your typical that is for sure, but all the same good."
2,Adorable design on a cheap mug,"And I don't mean cheap as in ""inexpensive."" I bought this completely on impulse because I was so charmed by the design and I thought someone else noted that these were good quality. So I bought two at 10.95 each and was all excited when they arrived (early, no less). I could not have been more disappointed when I lifted the mug out of the packaging. The design is still adorable, but - especially for more than $10 each - the mug itself is cheap and thin. I had two of these in college and hated them. There's no weight to it, and I know from experience that it becomes searing hot when a hot beverage is in it. Many of my other mugs are of quality material that protects your hand to at least some extent. I can't give one star because the design is as advertised and the delivery was quick. But I'm very disappointed in the material and because of that, I don't think I'll use them as much as I would have liked."
5,Good Laser Level,After reading the last 3 reviews I didn't know what to expect when I received my tool. 2 reviewers gave it 1 star and 1 reviewer gave it 5 stars. I then realized that the people that respond to the reviews are either very excited about the product or sorely disappointed. My review comes from a DIY'er in Atlanta that found the tool very helpful. It seemed to be level and plumb and didn't mare my drywall. I even dropped the unit on my hardwood floor and it still worked. It is made of cheap plastic and probably not a good choice for a professional but works very well for a DIY'er like myself.
1,Nice design. Poorly built.,"This level was a nice gift for a few moments, but soon failed. It is made of cheap plastic, more reminiscent of a $3 dollar toy than a $50 tool. It has a sliding plastic switch that allows you to turn the laser on, and select whether or not you want the laser to be fixed or auto-leveling. This switch is linked to some sort of electric connection and a mechanical linkage within the device - which jammed after the first use. Now the laser is stuck in the fixed, on, position. Useless to me now.I am returning it, and will not request another. I assume there are more reputable tool makers that make a similar device that is better designed and constructed.I would not recommend this product. Better to pay more and have something that will last."
2,Did not work right from begining,"Only one line; horizontal, was focused but other two vertical lines were out of focus. This defeats the purpose of this product.After 3-4 use laser lines won't turn on, I had to shake it a bit to turn on laser light beams."
2,"Great when it works, but not reliable","When the laser is operating at full intensity, the tool is very useful. More often, however, the laser dims dramatically and I have to tap the case several times to restore the proper brightness. The slightest vibration causes the laser to dim again, frustrating my attempts to use this tool.If I had it to do over again, I would gladly pay more for a higher quality laser tool."
2,Laser light keeps flickering and dimming,"The price is right, the features are useful, but one of the most important characteristics, the visability of the laser line I found poor. It sometimes dims, the horizontal lines don't line up exactly, and the laser lines put down are a bit wide -- compared to my $10 no-frills laser straight line. I have to smack my unit around to get the red lasers to brighten when it will inexplicably get dim all by themselves -- yes, I did take the plastic safety insert out of the laser. Seems like I got a shoddy/defective unit.If I had purchased it from a brick & morter I would definitely bring it back for a swap."
4,delivers as promised,"level is dead on. lines do blur a bit once you move farther away (10ft or so) but only by a few mm.will only level on a wall, if you're placing it on the ground (ie tile work) the level function doesn't work. Switch it to the locked position.having the intersection point is very helpful.the unit seems big but with the included strips hangs to any surface well.I don't recommend it, but my unit survived a 20 ft fall onto concrete floor."
1,Fuzzy out of focus line...,Sent the item back... the laser line was fuzzy/out of focus... NOT GOOD for me...
5,strait-line crossed line laser,Excellent item for the cheap do-it-yourselfer. Great item that does the same as the 400 dollar level but costs 95% less. Love it. Now I am demolishing my baths and running level and straight-lines to make perfect re-dos. Popping chalk-lines is an old-school trick. I am so happy....well I will get many hundreds of dollars of use out of this baby. Thanx a mill. I expected far-less for the price.
4,Good for home projects,It served its purpose well for the renovation projects around my house. I gave it four versus five star rating only because the black slider switch is a bit tough to move from one position to the next as it needs more grip(s) on the top surface.
4,Works great once it calms down,"The self-leveling part can take a while to settle down to level, especially if you ""unlock"" it before getting it steady. But otherwise this works great and has saved me lots of re-measuring and re-nailing. I love that it shows you the cross-section and has lines going horizontal and vertical."
2,Beautiful voice but...,"This album is full of filler. I loved her voice on the beginning of ""Monday Love,"" and the interludes were pretty. But sadly, that's it."
2,Not very good,"They shipped very quickly, but they didn't package them very well so the coating was chipped and flaking off. They gave me a discount to keep them, but I still have to ship the replacements back. So unless you want to deal with painting the springs don't bother getting them from Amazon."
4,Where were these guys???,Premiere blues/funk music. I can't believe I never heard of these guys. I picked up the CD on a whim because I thought the cover looked cool. It's turned out to be one of my favorites and the members of the band are all extremely talented. It's a shame we didn't hear more from them.
4,Pleased,I did a fair amount of shopping and comparing. The price at Amazon and the performance of the Sharp TV are winning combinations. The TV met all expectations.
3,sound quality : not the best,"just bought this tv. I should have spend a little more for the panasonic or sony .I shopped this tv every where . Best place to buy circiut city $526.00 . new in box .You have to ask for this t.v Not on display I don't why they do that , maybe to get the internet shoppers in the store ."
2,a first edition?,"I am currently taking a first class in Dutch and using this book as the text. I have found it fine as far a grammar goes, but the organization of vocabulary is terrible. The words are not really grouped according to any theme stronger than a conversation at the end of each chapter. For example the word appel (apple) is found many chapters ahead of the verb eten (to eat). This makes both learning these word lists and carrying on mock conversations quite difficult. I don't know Dutch, but I feel in this respect I could construct a better textbook."
3,Sounds Like Player But not too original!!!,"This CD by Player with Peter Beckett is ok but sounds kind of empty when you listen to it. Every song sounds the same--not as interesting as the earlier Player albums. Pete Beckett is there and sings a few songs but it all sounds the same after the first 5 cuts. Peter is a good singer and songwriter but I think he ran out of ideas on this album. Sounds so much like 80s rock warmed over. What missing is the original band to support peter and making the songs more diverse, not so the same. No wonder Player did not release an album after this. Peter has a solo album out but it is hard to get and very expensive. I still wonder what it sounds like. Anyone out there have it?"
1,The Last Prison,"While the topic is original, the writing and presentation are extremely poor. Significant effort went into this book, unfortunately the result does not reflect this. It is a good source of information, but it was clearly written by an amateur."
4,"good one, overall",good trimmer. Shaver doesn't shave in areas near chin as well as i would have liked. Overall I'm happy with it.
4,cheap shaver,"You get what you pay for. I am very happy with this purchase, but I did not expect much."
5,Good one,"This is clean, cuts neat and smooth. Much better than the horrible Remington I had before. Holds the charge well too"
4,Gets the job done,"I bought this electric shaver a few months ago to replace regular gillette razor blades. It took a few weeks to get used to the different kind of shave but once you get the hang of the little nuances that come with electric shavers it'll definetely get the job done just as quick as the razor blades and a pretty clean shave without irritation.I was looking at the self cleaning electric shavers and they look like an even better buy, albeit a sizeable bit more expensive, but if you don't mind cleaning the head a few minutes after every shave these'll do great.4 out of 5 stars because it isn't the greatest, but you won't be dissapointed."
4,Pretty good electric shaver...,"Purchased this shaver because I needed a new one and this one was going for a pretty good price. Shaves nice, not as close as a blade but alright for an inexpensive shaver. Lasts about a week between charges at a couple minutes a day. It's a little on the bigger side but if you're not going to take it with you anywhere then it shouldn't be a problem. Overall I'm happy with it, it's just a shaver after all. It does what it's supposed to do."
5,Nice Shave,"This gives a nice shave, worth the $30. If the batteries are drained, you just plug it in and you are up and running right away with full poer. This is because it has the transformer built in to the unit. If you buy one that has the transformer at the plug, then evidently it won't run when you plug it in and the batteries are low."
2,Poor Quality,This electric razor is an example of poor constuction. To date my prior Norelco Razors had metallic heads. This one is plastic. There was no literature included in the package to inform me of battery number ot type. I would not recommend this model.
5,Excellent,My daughter absolutely loves this. It is great to take on the boat on long weekends and on trips and even to the babysitters house. The video's are inexpensive as well. Great Buy!@!
3,not worth it,"My friend got one for Christmas last year.She said that I could use it for a while. When I pushed play, I could barely see it. Also, the screen is too small, and all the videos they have are mostly nickolodeon.If you are thinking about buying one it will be a waste of money.IF you want something to watch while your traveling go buy a portable dvd player like we have now,and it works great.HINT:the reason video now is so cheap is because it doesn't work that well.First it was $49.99, now it's $39.95."
1,horrible it is the worst tv EVER,i had it for a couple of days and first it comes with spogebob nobody likes spongebob next it is black and white and the vision quality is 2.00 and then nextit breaks ifget it a little bit wet this is worth around 0 dollers dont but this if ure looking for a little tv go to radio shack
5,"To see the ups and downs of video now, Read this!","I got this video now toy. It's great.When you get it, it comes with one of the greatest show (my personal fave) Spongebob Squarepants in ""band geeks."" It is fun because it's all your favorite shows, it's small enough to take it anywhere and you never have to miss one of your favorite tv shows. The durabitity level can not be higher. I must have dropped it about 10 times already ( and I just got it!) and it's fine. It just stops and freezes but after a few moments its right on track! Although it isn't very educational, it does have many real life expirences to help you with. So come go out to ""toysrus"" and get this thing for to much fun!"
3,USA USA USA,"Videonow color is way better .Not only is color better than black&white it has a much bigger screen.You can really enjoy it.and FYI it can be educational they DO have shark week ,Jeff Corwin, and Dino.Planet .Which can be very educational as well as fun.You just have to look before you leap.See if the shows are ones you or your child will enjoy.All in all videonow color is great for younger and older kids. And if your an adult and want it....More power to ya =0) LOL"
5,Neat Toy!!!,"Bought for my 2 year old who loves it. Very easy to use even an adult can figure it out.(After the 2 year old shows you, just kidding). It has been dropped quite a bit and still works fine. Great for trips or when there is something you want to watch on TV. Great toy for the price. Something that your kids will be able to get a lot of use out of. And it does pause once in a while, like a cd player without anti skip device does but it is only for a second if the player gets bumped or dropped."
1,No Bargain After all,This would have been the perfect buy; I was so excited to get such a good deal. And then I couldn't find one single black and white disc. And I looked everywhere. I was very disappointed.
5,Found: B&W Discs!!!!,(...)Or look it up at Habro's website. You will find very reasonably priced PVD's for B&W; VideoNow. I think this can be a great product or gift and an incredible value.
2,Waste of money!,"Grandparents bought the Video Now for our 7 year old son for Christmas. It is now June, and the Video Now is broken and was untouched for some time before it was discovered to be broken. The small screen and flickering images gave our son a headache, which made us limit the time that he could spend watching it. The cost of the disks was ridiculous, as was the cost of the many, many batteries it took to run the thing for half an hour at a time.Basically, it is yet another money drainer for parents. All of the cartoons are available, in full color, on TV and on video and dvd for those absolutely desperate to watch non-stop Sponge Bob or whatever. There were no educational disks that I could find for our son, and he was soon totally disinterested in using it.All that I can say in its favor, is that I'm SO glad that *I* didn't waste money buying the VN!!"
4,Pretty Good,"I like this toy a lot-i am 14 years old and like to go camping, but it takes 11 whole hours to get to where we go.So I always bring my video now and my little sister is always begging to use it. It's a great toy, not very educational though, unless you get like jeff corwin or something. Hasbro, i think you should do disney channel shows too, not just nickelodeon."
4,Be Smart With Your Money,"I got this from my dad 1 christmas ago ... I havn't used it since.It came with an episode of spongebob and nothing else.The controls are easy to use but aditional discs are expensiveas are the accessories. If you want strictly TV shows in black and white, and can't afford a portable DVD player, be my guest.However if you like colour... don't buy the ""Video Now Color""it's (...) and the discs are no better, just buy GBA video cartriges they hold 4 episodes of a show (and the screen is bigger and they're all in color).Be responsible with your money."
3,Too many problems,"We recently bought my son a video now player. We have had nothing but problems with it. The batteries wear out very quickly. Now the player will not even function. Because we cannot find the receipt, we are stuck with a non working player. I would caution anyone that buys one, to make sure they hang on to their receipt, and buy lots of batteries."
4,"Those poor, self-absorbed Russians!","Somehow I have missed reading any Dostoevsky, so this was a new experience. I've met a few Russians, and Dostoevsky was surely true to his nationality: So self-absorbed, and such a false self-image! Depressing to read, so I don't need any more. If you want to see how a people mislead themselves, read this.Since they are short stories, you can take this in small doses."
5,All the Uke chords you will ever need!,"The ""Treasury of Ukulele Chords"" is a wonderful book for anyone who plays or wants to play a ukulele. The chords are easy to find and are displayed in a useful and clear fashion. Each page lists chords with various positions making it easy to find the fingering that suits you and your abilities best. A true treasure book."
3,The 3rd and 4th books in the Norby series.,"This volume is a combination of the third and fourth books in the humorous Norby series of science fiction books for children about a space cadet and his unusual robot Norby. In the first story, ""Norby and the Lost Princess,"" Jeff and Norby locate a planet populated by humans who had been transplanted from Earth millennia ago. They rescue a young princess trapped on another planet who has been changed into a plant. In the second story, ""Norby and the Invaders,"" beings from another planet have invaded the planet of friendly dragons and deactivated all of that planet's robots. Jeff and Norby attempt to thwart the invaders who, they discover, believe that technology is bad. They all learn that only misuse of technology is bad."
3,Slow,"I just didn't see it. Yes, Ms. Brisbin knows how to plot her characters, but I didn't see the spark between them. They were bland and plodding throughout the story; I never got a sense of urgency over Adrian's impending death, nor of Miranda's feelings over this, which should have been devastating. There was simply nothing there. Everything simply moved along. I really enjoyed Miranda's friend, Sophie, much more than Miranda herself, but she was regulated to the extreme background, as with all Harlequin books.Still, the medical knowledge portrayed in this was extremely well done. Kudos to Ms. Brisbin for that.I need to stop reading romances for a while, I think. I know Ms. Brisbin is a wonderful writer, but this story just didn't work."
3,A nice sweet romance,"This usually ain't the kind of romance that I read: husband and wife married for years who finally start to love each other. But I found myself reading this into the night and actually enjoying it. However I only gave it three stars because when Adrian, Duke of Windmere finally starts to treat his wife with more than cool tolerance, it just seems highly unlikely.Adrian overhears his doctor outside discussing his case and saying that he will die soon. Panic overcomes him and he decides that he needs to work it out where his wife, Miranda is still taken care of. He starts to realize that he loves his wife and starts making a list of eligible men to marry her after he is gone.This is a sweet romance that really has no punch to it. But, it's still a great read. I didn't like how cold he was to his wife at the beginning but he comes around in time. Not as good as most historical's like Gaelen Foley and Johanna Lindsey. Still, you should give it a try."
4,The truth is coming out,"Finally a book that is not afraid to talk about the most poisonous snake of them all: Madeline K. Albright. Favourite line: Labeling Washington an imperial power, Boutros-Ghali said the United States ``sees little need for diplomacy; power is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacy...the Roman Empire had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the United States.''"
2,disappointed,"I was quite excited to get this, since I was looking for a high quality copy of dominique moceanu's 1995 aa & ef routines. However, I was VERY disappointed to find that they CHANGED THE MUSIC to all of the floor routines featured on the tape! I suppose this was for copyright reasons, but I would not have bought it if i had known. Also, although all of dominiques routines are featured in the aa half of the tape, NONE of her ef routines were shown."
4,Not A Repeat Of The Standards...,"Of course part of it's charm is that it's NOT another repeat of the old standard classics. I do enjoy the song that are included on this CD & find it refreshing that it's not a repeat of the last CD I just listened to!!! Yes, it has Silent Night & Hark the Herald Angles Sing...it also has many Christmas themed songs I've never heard. There are a few that I've heard before, but are not on EVERY CD I buy. All-in-all I'm happy with my purchase!!!"
2,Tight fit,M-D Building Products 92924 48-Inch Soft Carrying CaseThe level fits into the case with no room to spare. so tight that I think the zipper will eventually split.
1,NEVER RECIEVED ITEM,"I have never recieved the item, nor have I been refunded, and I haven't even heard from them in weeks. I am about to pursue legal action."
2,A nice collection of Lamen,"For practical uses, well it has none. It has no circle no times a lot seems to be implied, and the conjurings serve only for knowledge better obtained by non-infernal beings who have a tendency to lie. However its a really nice volume if you want a collection of lamen."
5,Great Albulm,"This Album is Fantasic in every sense, It is completely heart felt and raw emotion I absolutely recommend this album to anyone who is apprieciative of honest to goodness music.A++++++++++++"
5,Works great but....,"I have been taking these vitamins since 12/24/11. I started off taking two per day but.... I noticed my urine was like a ""Neon"" yellow. When I read all the reviews I never once heard anyone talk about this in their review of this product. It changes the color of your urine. Because of this I started taking only one per day and in over 2 weeks I have at least one inch of new growth, so I know it works. I was just concerned with the color of my urine. When I googled Bright yellow urine, I found out that it is from ingesting a high amount of vitamin B, which this product has plenty of. It also stated that the body will only absorb what it needs and the rest is discarded through the urine which makes the color almost a fluoresant/neon yellow color. So for all of you who may have noticed this slight missing detail from other reviews, now you know. I will update you on how I am doing with only taking one pill per day instead of the 2 in about a month."
1,I hate the smell and after taste of thie hair supplments,Sorry to put this product groganics hair supplements down...but it didnt do NOTHING and NO improvements to my hair which i had a horrible chop!! this groganics smells bad and gave me a bad aftertaste in my mouth from this supplements...I still have it and plan to toss it in the trash!!
2,Still Waiting,"I purchased a bottle 15 days ago. My $15.99 bottle is empty. There are 30 pills in the bottle which the directions are to take 2 a day. Now you do the math.That means that you're only purchasing a 15 day supply for $15.99. This will be very expensive, if you don't achieve results soon.I just purchase my second $15.99 bottle, I'm not sure what to expect, due to I have medium length hair with thinning near my ear area. Other wise, a nice healthy head of hair, so far no results.So if you have alot of thinning or baldness this will definitely be very expensive. But it's worth it if you grow your hair back. Right!!!I'll check back in after I finish this bottle (2nd bottle).Until then bye, bye!"
3,Gift for Grandson,"This set was to be a gift for my Grandson. While the set seems to be in perfect condition, the box has more damage than I expected. The seller had indicated that the box had some wear, and it was priced lower than other sellers. I did not, however, expect it to be as worn as it was. I was disappointed, but I will give the gift as it is as I don't I have a choice"
4,Great addition!,"My husband had been looking at adding to his Yankee attire and these seemed like the perfect fit. They are thick enough to cushion, but not too thick to be uncomfortable. They arrived quickly, they're a fun touch and a good deal. He likes them a lot."
5,"""perfit""","I ordered 2 pair, 1 for my brother-in-law and my father-in-law. They arrived in a timely fashion and were a perect fit! Thank you!"
2,The Less Than Everything Drums Book,"The Everything Drums Book doesn't address the classical grip. So unless you hold both sticks the same way, most of the sections on technique will only give you 50% of what you want. It gives nothing of the particulars of drum tuning. Only generalities. To its credit it does have some very good exercises that will improve your stick control. I got the e-version. Wish I had the CD. I would not buy this book again. Live and learn."
5,angelic,"kim has a very beautiful and angelic voice!! I still can't figure out why she's not with the other leading ladies of gospel! Her voice is profoundly anointed, inspirational and beyond belief!!!!!!!"
1,Not what I ordered............,The above item was not what I thought it was and I had ordered 2 of them for my granddaughters. They of course were very disappointed as they live in Key West and I sent them from Michigan. I tried every possible thing I can think of and could get no one to replace them with the right item.Everyone passed the buck and no one would take care of the problem so my girls had no gift and I just lost the money. NEVER DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY........THEY ARE A COMPLETE SHAM....It nearly soured me on Amazon.
1,junk,We bought two of these at Christmas. Neither one works as of March. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
4,Better than Play-Doh...but pricey,"I really love this dough. So easy to use and doesn't crumble. You need to make sure you put it in a ziplock bag as soon as you are done playing with it because it will harden (it does NOT come with storage containers). Seems a bit pricey....that's the only reason for the 4 star instead of 5. But, my 2 year old daughter loves this stuff!"
4,Need a way to seal unused clay,"First let me say the colors and quality of clay are awesome and my son loved them! The issue I have is with the packaging each color comes in. Once you open them, they kind of rip open all the way, so I had to use a bunch of zip lock baggies for each handlful of clay that was left over after making a few animals with the clay. Would be great if each color was in a resealable bag since this clay does air dry and harden."
2,Gift,This was a disappoint for the little girl I bought it for. I will have to get her something else. Too bad.
4,Best for older kids,"I bought this for my 7 year old because he said he had modeling clay at school and wanted to use it over the summer at our house. So I bought it thinking it would be just like Playdoh, only it dries out better. Wrong. This variety pack has 10 packs inside, all pretty small in my estimation (less than 1/2 of what a standard playdoh container holds) and does not come in reusable bags. So once they are open, that's it - use it or it dries out. Now I did try to keep them in a reusable plastic container, but if they touch each other the colors mix together, they do not come apart easily at all. But the biggest issue is it's not really that much fun for him, and he's a pretty creative kid so I'm not sure what is missing. So overall, I think this is great for kids older than 8 who probably can navigate all the issues of clay better than younger kids."
1,Do not buy,We purchased 6 of these for ourselves and as gifts . Within 18 months all have quit working and the company refuses to stand behind them. Buyer beware!!!
2,Bad. Stay away from,The Pros:Fast coffee making (when it worked)Nice selection of coffeeThe cons:Machine quite working after 5-6 months. Cleaned and parts replaced. Still quit workingBought another one (shouldn't have done that). 2nd machine quite the same way. It just get stuck and does not pour water thru the coffee container.Then my wife went and bought the newer model. That one also quite within 4 months.The coffee is way too expensive when you calculate (you are paying upward of $35 per lb).I would not use this BRAND again at all.
1,Only 1 star because I couldn't give it zero,"*DO NOT BUY* Unless you're a masochist, and like tinkering with products constantly. I am on my second Keurig. The first one clogged continuously and after 3 months of frustration, Keurig sent me a second inferior model. It lasted all of 6 months and started clogging, giving me half cups, half of which are coffee grounds. There should be a class action against this company. Unfortunately even if there is, all you will get is a free 20 pack of K-cups as a settlement, the lawyers will get the rest. Do your homework and google it. This product sucks."
2,Really bummed!,"I bought the Keurig Special Edition B60 after reading TONS of reviews on the various Keurig coffee makers and it quit pumping after only two weeks of use! Seriously, I probably only made a total of 20 cups! I read a couple of reviews that said something about using a bent paper clip to clear clogs but since I really don't know the exact reason it quit pumping I didn't want to just go sticking a metal object in it. Plus, I think only working for two weeks is ridiculous! It made great coffee so I'm going to do more research and see if they make a more reliable machine. Wish me luck!Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System"
2,Doesn't make good coffee,"I did all the research and read all the reviews and purchased the Keurig B60. It was fun for about a week. The clean-up is easy, it works fast, I really have fun using it. It is cool, no doubt. I just haven't had a really yummy cup of coffee yet. Every cup is weak and tasteless. And I like weak coffee! Dunkin Donuts is my favorite coffee for goodness sakes! My Krups made much better coffee. I think now that the novelty has worn off, I'll try the Tossimo. By the way, I tried Timothy's, Caribou (which had the most flavor), Donut shop, Glorias, Vermont, Tully's and Green Mountain. ALL TASTELESS pretty much. I am bummed because the concept is really cool. It also takes 2 K cups to make fill a regular size coffee mug. That's not really cost effective. The coffee wasn't that hot either. I had to nuke it after about 2 minutes."
3,Worked great for a while,"We tried using this as an office brewer for an office with 3 coffee drinkers. It lasted for a few months, but then began to have the problems described in the discussion forums. It stops pumping water and shuts itself off. We now have 4 people in the office and are about to have 5 or more. Therefore, we are switching to a commercial model. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't even offer those models."
5,Enjoying a cup right now!,"Purchasing was a breeze, it shipped quick and the price was great! Works great, am enjoying a cup of coffee as we speak!! Thanks PS Recommend the single cup attactment so you can use your own coffee!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Used this for two cups a day (only ) was not fixable after two years. Buy a $20 Proctor Silex that lasts 4-6 years !,Customer Service offered new purchase at reduced price but why waste more $'s when it'll be useless again in such a short time. $200 machine should last or at least be fixable!"
2,Disappointed,"Dear Fellow Consumers,I bought this model last spring. My husband and I loved it. I am a busy graduate student and mother and this was great to make fast coffee on the go; however, after less than a year the Keurig will not turn on... I can not get in to the machine to service it without risk of damaging it, so I had to replace it and wait until I have time to call the company. I replaced the Keurig with a traditional coffee maker, which I can program to brew the night before for quick coffee in the morning at 1/3 the price.I am extremely disappointed about this and it makes me wonder about the quality and usability of this brand.Sincerely,Elizabeth"
2,"Was great at first.2 years later, problem city","I wrote this great review almost 2 years ago about how the machine was great, etc.I am now saying ""STAY AWAY!"" from Keurig machines.It is not even 2 years old and problems are already present. The pump is starting to fail already and half the time, the machine won't produce more than a quarter cup of coffee. It seems this is a common problem with the Keurig brewers as I have read all over the web this sort of thing is happening with all their machines. They are pretty much designed to work a year or so then break so you have to buy a new one.Look into the other brands out there if you want a single cup brewer. Keurig can kiss my @$$."
2,Cheaper than Starbucks!,"I'm on my third one in 18 months...Great coffee but I'm getting tired of buying new machines. The last one lasted 4 months. But like my husband said ""Cheaper than Starbucks"""
2,Great Coffee But As Unreliable As Can Get,My inlaws have a 2 of these coffee makers and have very few problems. Me I am on my 4th coffee maker in year. They make great coffee and are as convenient as you can get. But simply put they clog easily and even after cleaning them per Keurig's instructions are still problematic. I live in a city and hate the taste of the water so I filter all the water through a Britta filter and that doesn't even help. As much as I love the coffee and convenience I would not pay for another brewer. The only reason I still have one is because of the warranty but otherwise when this one dies and warranty is gone its over. $100 for a coffee maker that won't stay working isn't worth it and many people feel the same as me.
3,Keurig,"Atlas I am writing a review about a product my office uses. Its a great invention, I love the individual cups of coffee it produces. However it isnt giving me the best tasting coffee. Its a mess to clean up and takes up too much water. I need to find a new solution for the cups, some of the reviews here will be helping me! Overall its an average brewer that does its job."
1,Don't buy if you plan on drinking coffee for over 51 weeks,"I read all the reviews on Keurig and how the coffee maker would only last a year. I thought surely Keurig can't dump a product into the market that breaks in a year, and especially when they knew about it. Well, I bought it, gave it to my wife/myself for Christmas 2011, and sure enough 50 weeks later it broke, it just stopped working. So rather than get another one, I'm going old school and getting a regular coffee maker. Disappointing that it would break almost to the day it was purchased. Don't be a sucker and get this item if you want to have something reliable and worth the money. Buck < Bang"
5,My Keurig,"Love my Keurig, I'm the only who drinks coffee in my house, so this is the best cup for me. Also when you have company you can make everyone their own special coffee."
3,Consistently good coffee: Produces loads of trash,"It make consistently good coffee, and hot water on tap for making tea. It's very easy to use, and it requires virtually no maintenance. We have one of these in our office, and it's been a solid performer and hassle free. However, one consideration is that every cup of coffee made produces trash - the coffee pod packaging, and for that I deducted 2 stars.I'd consider having one in my home, save for the trash issue."
2,Don't buy this if you like your coffee steaming hot,"If you like your coffee steaming hot this is not the coffee maker for you. I am very disappointed in this machine. The user manual says that the water heats to 192 degrees, however when I tested the coffee coming out of the machine it is only 180 degrees. I have to microwave every cup. I called the Keurig tech and he said this is correct, it can lose 12 degrees by the time it gets to the cup."
2,Buy a Bunn MCP....,"FOr the extra money it's well worth it. It makes from 4-12 oz cups of coffee, and we've had ours for 3 years. My husband is a Starbucks coffee drinker he loves it and makes 3-6 cups a day with it. We get our coffee from Coffee Whiz.com Good prices and free shipping."
4,"very easy to make, could be a little hotter","My husband loves it, but I think the coffee could be a bit warmer"
2,Grinds leak into coffee every time,"I want to like this coffeemaker, but I don't. Maybe mine is special since no one else has complained of this, but I get a nasty layer of grinds in the bottom of every cup of coffee, no matter how carefully I close the lid over the K-cup. I've tried a couple different brands of K-cups with the same result. The cofee tastes fine, I just can't get over the gritty texture at the bottom of every cup."
2,bad coffee,"I had this unit for 1 week and I tried many types of k-cup coffee pods and water supply from tap to filtered and also bottled.Not sure why all the good reviews (employees of various tiers?) but this machine puts out really bad coffee, tastes like diner coffee. I'm basing this review on Medium cup setting and only on what it produces not the convenience that the machine yields.You people have really low standards when it comes to taste of coffee!"
2,Not wanted,"I can't provide any information concerning this item. I ordered it by mistake. I tried to cancel, but it was sent anyway, review reflects vendor not coffee maker.I also ordered a supply of the coffee for it from another vendor. This vendor canceled the order in a very professional manner. Seems one vendor was very co-operative and the other was not. Gave it away as a gift."
1,the item pictured is not the correct item or price,"the brewing system pictured is a B70, very different than the B60, and a different cost as well. It should not be marked 199.00 as its normal cost is around 159.00. this needs to be corrected."
2,Makes decent sludge if you are into that.,"I bought one of these machines because of the great reviews it got from online coffee reviewers. Having actually tried one, I believe the reviewers must be bought and paid for because the coffee that comes out of this thing tastes like swamp-water. I guess if you do not have very discernible taste when it comes to coffee it would serve as a quick sludge maker for people on the run. But I wouldn't count on it if you know anything about good coffee."
2,weak coffee,"I been wanting a Keurig and received one as a gift!!!! I am very disappointed!! the coffee is so weak i have to use 2 kcups to get a cup of coffee with taste!!!!! Also the kcups are not cheap, now i am not sure how to tell the person who gave me the gift (my husband) I rather use my old coffee maker.so sadKathrin"
2,Small Cups,"We used for a year or so, but the unit has been in the garage for months now. The amount of coffee you get from each k-cup just wasn't worth the trouble and expense. We're using our old Mr. Coffee again. Our unit will go to the Salvation Army, Goodwill, etc."
4,Good but the coffee is too strong,I like my coffee black or with a drop of half and half. I have to choose the travel mug size to get the right strength for my taste. It's ironic that many of the other reviews say it is too weak. Everything else works well.
2,Very basic,"This is the most basic version of Keurig's machines. It worked well for the first six months, and then started to develop problems. I have since purchased higher-end model of this machine, which works perfectly.If you like Keurig, buy the better model. You will end up wasting your money on this particular model."
3,tepid,"second one, returned first, water reaches cup at 160 degrees, coffee is not hot-tepid, lost receipt or would return, now two step process, use elite then microwave..,customer service at a loss."
1,Another dud.,"I had 2 B70s die so thought I would go cheaper and get the B60 since I had a stockpile of K-cups and the B70s are really expensive disposable coffee machines. Well, this one just died and I've only had it for 6 months. Hopefully, I will get a free replacement. I doubt that I will ever buy another Keurig product."
1,Ack!,"We did buy this machine at Costco, not Amazon, but it has never worked well. Every once in awhile we must descale (code for ""hard water issue""?) and it is a pain. When it does work, it does not function appropriately. We should probably have returned it immediately, and with Amazon's wonderful customer service we now know to buy future items from them."
1,Blech!,"Received the Keurig B60 for Christmas. For four days I tried every possible variation to coax a cup of coffee out of this thing. Different K-cups, difference cup sizes, even used my own coffee with the optional filter insert. Not one palatable cup - poured them all out. Weak and tepid with no flavor. Looked more like tea than coffee. Now I learn that weak coffee is a common complaint. My machine is back in the box and on its way back from wence it came. I am beginning to think that the thing is defective. Too late for me, after my frustrating experience, I can't even look at one of these things again."
1,if you like your coffee to smell and taste like plastic,"After Tassimo/Bosch broke up with starbucks, I began anticipating the purchase of a Keurig to replace my Tassimo, so we could enjoy Starbucks k cups.The Keurig is easy and convenient to use and if you like your coffee to smell like plastic this is the machine for you.After following set-up instructions,we made our first kcups, and could not get the plastic smell to disappear.Wasted several of the ""freebies"", thinking that the smell and chemical taste would go away. Contacted Keurig, they acted like they had never hadthis problem before. Told me to descale my brand new machine!!!Four hours later, smell/taste were still foul.Amazon was wonderful and took the machine back without original packaging and receipt.if you read the online reviews, this is not an isolated problem. I am relieved to have that machine out of my house- feltlike I was poisoning my family with every sip and smell."
1,More and more expensive,I've had my Keurig for three years. It's convenient. It's become more and more expensive to buy K-cups. Three years ago I could get K-cups for less than 30 cents apiece. Now I can't get a decent K-cup for less than 50 cents. And I swear they are putting less and less coffee in each cup. So it brews about 6 oz of coffee if I want it strong enough. I can get 24 oz of good strong coffee at Panera for $1.99.My Keurig now sits idle while I brew coffee with my Bodum coffee press. My Aroma AWK-115S X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle has become invaluable for heating water for my coffee press. And I can get a nice economical supply of Folger's Gourmet ground coffee from Subscribe & Save.If I had it to do all over again I would never have invested in a Keurig.
2,Big rip-off!,"Bought the special edition version of this coffee maker and I had the same problems many have posted about - 1/2 cups of coffee, water being pumped back into the reservoir, and just shutting off during brewing. After doing all the resetting and cleaning suggested I just put it on the shelf. Glad I saved the 6 year old Black and Decker - still works like a charm!!"
1,lasted almost 2 years,"Like the idea, and enjoy the ability to just make one cup. The Keurig product is very poor quality. I was able to keep mine working for almost 2 years, but will not give keurig any more of my money."
1,Keurig coffee machine - bad news,"Sad but it appears that Keurig practices the, all to relevant in today's products, ""planned obselesence"" method. Basically 3 of us bought similar Keurig machines about a year ago. All of our machines work about 50% of the time...generally only creating half a cup of coffee at a time. Sad state of affairs that a company purposely creates a device that is planned to not work within 12 months. I will never buy a Keurig, or anything else created by this company."
2,coffee addict,"I got this system about 8 months ago. It worked great for about 4 months, then problems started!You have to de-scale this machine every month or so. It involves about 1 hour total time, with white vinegar.The first 2 times I did this, no problem, then little by little, it had less power to brew a cup of coffee.It would just dribble coffee through the k-cup. I gave up after that.I brought back my Cuisinart that I had for 6 years and works like a dream!We love the idea of the Keurig, but the manufacturing stinks!Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System"
1,Dead after 9 months,This system was great until in turned into a brick after nine months of use. Completely dead and there are many other users on the web complaining about the same thing.
1,faulty design,"I think this is a great idea, and it worked well for about 3 months. Then it began brewing half cups. Never gave a ""descale"" light, but I did anyway, to no avail.After several hours of customer service, and trying ""this and that"", they finally agreed to send a new unit. I had to mail in a part to prove ownership. New unit worked well for about 4 months, then the same thing. At the same time, my aunt had a similar problem, as did a co-worker.The pump or something is bad in these, and fails after about 4 months (at ~3 cups/day) usage.I hope they work out the problems...in the mean time, they will have to send me a new unit on a quarterly basis, or else I'm going back to my Bunn."
4,Awesome coffee maker - if you pre soak the pod,"I love the look and the convenience; however the coffee comes out very weak when using the medium cup or the larger mug setting. A remedy for this is to interrupt the brewing process. Basically when the coffee just starts to drip, I open up the lid and stop it for 20-30 seconds, thus allowing the k-cup to pre soak. Then I close the lid and the brewing continues. The coffee comes out awesome. You don't even need to buy the extra bold cups. I wish Keurig had a slower drip setting to get the most of each k-cup, but my method works pretty well."
3,Disappointed....,"I agree with K. Urbaniak, it's impossible to get a good cup of coffee unless you use the extra bold k-cup with the small cup size. I found the filter to be useless. Even after filling the filter to the rim and selecting the smallest cup size, coffee tastes bitter and very weak. Also like K. Urbaniak has mentioned, there was plain water streaming at the end of the brew. Also, I think the water runs through the filter too quickly not giving enough time to brew. What I don't understand is why have 3 cup sizes when you only have ONE size k-cups. Even if you use the extra bold k-cups with the 9 oz travel mug it will still tastes weak. I thought I found the perfect coffee maker. One that gives me the freedom to choose between pods and filter, instead I got a coffee maker that only makes a good cup of coffee when you use the smallest brew cup size with the extra bold k-cups.What I like about this machine is it's easy to use and convenient."
1,Defective out of the box,"Hooked it up and it leaked water out of the bottom. Called Keurig who did not seem surprised by the problem. They said they would ship a new one out along with a prepaid fedex shipping label to send the old one back ""for testing to see why this happened."" Right. Keurig needs to get it together. Pretty inexcusable. If you can find a comparable coffee maker, I would buy it over keurig."
1,Won't last a month,Had about 3 of these machines. They die after a few months. It's a known issue that Keurig won't fix. Buyer beware.
1,Horrible warranty,"My brewer will not work unless I unplug for 10 minutes prior to using it. The problem first surfaced 11 months into owning it, though was not diagnosed properly until after the warranty period ended (12 months).If you buy one, you may need to replace it...yearly."
2,Keurig B60,"I was so looking forward to getting this coffee maker, and for the first couple of months or so it was perfect. Then it started running slow, then it brewed only about half of a cup coffee each time, finally it wouldn't brew at all. I followed all the instructions, cleaned it like we were supposed to and nothing worked. It's so frustrating because there is nowhere to get it repaired...it will now be put in one of our overflowing landfills, and I have to spend another $150 to buy another one and hope that that one lasts more than a couple of months. I know things can go wrong with a product; but the problem is there is no help for when they do. Disappointed in the quality."
3,"Lasted Two Years, almost to the Day....LOL!!","I bought this machine on January 8, 2010. It died today. It went to that great dumpster in the sky. I know, I know, I shouldn't buy another one but it's very convenient, easy to clean up and the coffees and teas are great. Hopefully, the new one will do better, not worse."
1,Junk That Will Not Last,"We got this brewer for a Christmas gift and it wound up in the dumpster in less than 2 years.After a few issues with not properly filling the cups, the ground fault circuit interrupter started to cut power off to the Keurig at intervals. To be sure it was the Keurig at fault, not the GFCI, we moved the Keurig to another GFCI but it then began to trip the fault indication again.A tripped GFCI can indicate a condition that can cause electrical shock or fire, so we called Keurig. The service rep advised us to descale the device. That had already been done. He then offered a new Keurig for $69.After reading the other problem reports in Amazon, we decided to go back to our old coffee pot.This item appears to be another piece of imported trash that is a total waste of money."
2,B60 or any Keurig is wasted $$$,I purchased a Keurig from the QVC about 3 years ago - was excited when it arrived and it made what I consider a very good fresh cup of coffee - however only 1 month into the product and it would not produce. I called Keurig and they did not have the model I purchased but was willing to replace it with the B60 - well it worked - for about 2 months. I called again and they sent me a 3rd one. This one lasted almost a year before it started to do the same thing. I still use it today but about half the time it acts like it is starting to brew but will not brew - I open and close the device a 2nd time and it will then brew. Sometimes I only get 1/2 cup so I open / close again to get the use from the k-cup. You know for $150 this was a waste of my money. I could have purchased a coffee maker with espresso for about the same. I keep it going just because I like the convenience - even though I have to meddle with it almost every time I run it.... lots of hype - little quality.
1,Til death do us part,"I am joining the club of having a dead Keurig. It went nuts earlier this week, dripping and flashing the menu, so I turned it off while I contacted customer care. They suggested I call them. I had to do exactly that today as I went to make some tea and my Keurig wouldn't even turn on. Poor thing. They're sending me a new one and I have to send them back the cup holder part. Maybe the next one will do better!It sure does put out some tasty coffee; worth a phone call and replacement yearly, I guess."
2,"Convenient, but makes terrible coffee","Recently got the B60, as well as a number of different coffee pods, and the K-cup filter deal that allows me to put my own coffee grinds in it.. so far, we have not found ANY type or method that makes strong coffee.. we've tried French Roast, Italian roast, columbian,... and even when we put our own Italian Roast grinds in the filter, it makes weak coffee.If you like strong coffee, or even if you just like coffee that tastes like coffee,... this is NOT for you. If you like coffee that tastes like diner coffee that was watered down with 50% water, then get a Keurig."
2,Potential Hazardous water reserver!,"I was enjoying the convenience of the machine ....till I found out the water reserver is made of #6 plastic! And the instruction says you can keep water up to a week in the tank! How much chemical leach is there?? After the potential hazardous of certain plastic bottles, and all steel, aluminum, and all safer plastics became main stream for drinking water bottle, why #6 again? Number 6 plastics (polystyrene) are made into soft Styrofoam-style cups as well as rigid foams and hard plastic products, so remember to look for those little numbers in the arrows (don't feel bad if you need a magnifying glass). Avoid using them as much as possible. Why? Number 6 plastics can release potentially toxic breakdown products (including styrene). Get this: particularly when heated!I am planning to return the machine."
2,Not again!!,"We have owned two of these coffee makers only to have them both quit working within 6 months. We loved the coffee maker; however, wished it would last longer than 6 months! Thank goodness we purchased both at COSTCO so they are easily returned for yet another one. Let's see how long the thrid one last :)"
4,Whole family loves this machine,"I only drink coffee about once per week and only a cup or so at time. This machine sounded a lot easier than trying to make a pot of coffee, use filters, clean up, etc. And ... it is easier! Not only that, but we discovered a wide variety of drinks available from apple cider to hot teas and iced teas, hot chocolate and a ton of coffees.On cold mornings, I brew my children hot tea to start their day and it is so easy. Once week they get to pick a sugared drink like apple cider, sweet tea or hot chocolate.My only wish is that the machine included the larger reservoir... a family of 5 can drain the tank in about one go-round. We use only bottled water so I'm hoping I won't run into clogging problems as some have."
1,Read before making a decision,"I was given a B60 brewer as a gift. Worked fine for about 6 months and then problems started appearing. This is a poorly designed brewer. The needle that punctures the foil on the K cups has three narrow channels through which the hot water is injected into the K cup. For some reason, one or more of these channels is constantly clogging, requiring frequent cleaning with a straightened paper clip. Last cleaning lasted for 8 cups. Their customer service is just about worthless, just repeating the mantra of clean the needle. It's a shame because when the machine works, it brews good coffee and there is a tremendous variety of coffees available.I've reached the point where I am going to use up my inventory of k cups and then junk this piece of junk."
5,Great purchase.,"This is not a cheap coffee maker but it's been a great value for me as I rarely go to coffee shops anymore. I love the huge variety of K-Cups available, though you do need to order online to find the obscure flavors and companies. I'm a fan of variety so I really enjoy being able to have a different flavor of coffee every day. The bonus is that you can use the special ""My K-Cup"" filter to enter in your own ground coffee, which is a good way to save money. The machine also looks great in my modern kitchen.One negative I haven't seen other reviewers mention is the timer. There is no separate weekday and weekend setting for the timer. So it's a pretty useless feature if you don't wake up at the same time every day. Nobody wants to hear the loud rumbling of the machine warming up at 7 am on a Sunday morning.Other than this minor issue, I'm very happy with the machine and would buy another one if this one ever breaks down."
2,"nice, but not reliable","We purchased the machine as a xmas gift to ourselves last year. problems are, no water when you first start to make coffee.you had to shut it off then turn it back on for it to pump water for coffee. then last evening, it just quit. there were no lights, nothing worked. the machine was dead. I'm waiting to see what Keurig has to say, but I don't think I will hold my breath. We have purchased numerious pods for the machine, and now they are usless unless we decide to try another one. I hope others have longer success with their machines."
4,Keurig Is Now Quieter,"The new model is much quieter so the entire house does not know that I am making one cup of coffee just for me. My first Keurig went insane or else the little computer inside did, and it just started flashing and asking embarrassing questions about personal matters. It still made coffee, but I had to keep punching the brew button to make it work. I relegated the broken machine to the basement and ordered a new one. Viola. It was so much quieter. Still makes the fine cup of joe, but with less noise. Not even the dogs know that I am up and having a cup of ""Donut Shop."""
2,Prime Error,"The Coffee it makes is amazing, but after only having it for a month I'm getting a prime error. Very annoying to pay so much for a brewer and have it fail so quickly, even if Keurig will take care of it."
1,Keurig B60 = poor design,"Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing SystemI have had 4 B60 brewers - each time one broke down I was lucky enough that it happened within the 1 year period!!!After reading the reviews on line, what I don't understand is why KEURIG is so slow fixing all the defects?? Is itcost affective to keep relacing the brewer for the customer?? What about the customer frustration in wanting andnot getting a DEPENDABLE KEURIG BREWER."
5,"Ditto ""Mad Hatter's"" Review",I like the machine much more than I expected to! After owning a Senseo I am quite surprised by how GOOD the K-Cup coffees are. The Keurig is very well constructed and works like a charm. It's really nice to have a choice of 3 brew sizes since my hubby and I prefer different coffee strengths and now we each get exactly what we want. I don't plan to ever be without a Keurig! Great machine and highly recommended.
1,B60 Great BUT,I purchased a B60 15 months ago. I make only one cup of coffee per day with it. Just a week ago the B60 would not heat up the water. That means no coffee.. I loved it when it worked but cant afford to spend 130 -199 for a coffee machine that quits after such lite use.
1,buyer beware - poor response from keurig,"$150 & two coffee makers later, we realize Keurig is not a good choice. While it makes great coffee, the appliance itself is unreliable and Keurig customer service is non-responsive to our queries. We could have(and should have)purchased it at Costco because our neighbors units fail at the same rate but they just bring it back and get a new one at no charge. So if you MUST have a Keurig, buy it at Costco, keep the box and plan to return it every six months or so."
2,Fast but Weak!,"The single serving size and hi-tech look to the coffee pot won me over...unfortunately, the coffee was alwaysdisappointing and weak. It's great for tea, and I miss what cannot be...I'm not one of those Strong Starbuck Freaks, mind you...just want a full-rich-bodied coffee. I have a feeling the design is lacking, how could just a couple of itty bitty holes drip enough flavor thru a tightly packed ""k-cup"" and have it ""visit"" the grounds long enough produce a rich cup of coffee? IT CAN'T AND DOESN'T!I took it back today, and am thanking my lucky stars that Costco gave me my money back!Someday, when someone perfects this process, I'll buy another one...in the meantime, I will continue making a cup or two extra, and tossing it out...The Kuerig people are very nice, but they can't tell you how to fix the problem, no matter how strong a coffee you buy."
4,One of the best Keurig machines available,"We had the simple one-cup-at-a-time Keurig machine for a year or so and moved up to this 60 ounce capacity version for its convenience. The K-cups are expensive but when Costco began carrying them and a much better price, I was hooked.My only complaint, and the reason for the four-star rating, is that the machine stays slightly warm even when completely turned off. It irritates me when appliances suck power when not in use. Battery charges stay warm even when no battery is being charged, TVs go to standby when turned off, etc., etc. This coffee maker has a Ready For Brewing position that keeps the water constantly hot but when this setting is off and the machine is shut down, it still uses a small amount of power. Why? That's not necessary.Other than the power issue, I really like this machine."
1,Do Not Buy,"I am on my second one and it works just the same as the first one, which is to say, not very good. Both of them frequently would not pick up a prime so you had to lift up the water container and reseat it in order for it to pump in water for the next cup. If you forget to do that when you go to make another cup you have to stand there while it pumps in water and then heats it up, hardly instant coffee as advertised. In addition if you pump a new cup immediately when it indicates be ready it is seldom more than luke warm. Keurig said they would send me a third one which would work but they never did and I got tired of calling. I am throwing it away and starting over with another brand."
5,Happy coffee drinker,"Haven't had the machine for long, but we love it so far. It's perfect for when you're running out the door in a hurry, and my husband can have his stronger blend coffee and I get my flavored coffee with no waste. I love the variety of different coffees available and the ease of use. I definitely recommend this machine!"
3,Coffee,We love our new coffee maker such yummy coffee!!! There were some mailing issues the USPS lost our package but after brining the fact that we had not recieved the coffee maker to the sellers attention she sent another out 2nd day delivery. The coffee maker dose have some unexpected cosmetic scratches on the silver painted part of the machine but they do not effect the effectiveness of the coffee maker. Overall I am rating our experience a 3 and enjoying a cup of great coffee.
1,Loved it until it broke,"I bought this in December 2010. Less than 19 months later it is garbage. Initially, I was extremely pleased with this product, however, my husband wished it would have come with a larger cup size because he likes his coffee not so strong. We did not have any problems with the functionality until one day when it simply quit. We woke up to find the machine's lights off as if it was unplugged. After a little research on the internet, we learned that they often develop a leak that shorts out the electronics. I am now left with about 100 worthless K cups, since I refuse to purchase another Keurig. For $150 I would expect it to last at least 2 years."
3,Design Defective,"The B60 Keurig does a good job when it works. However, they tend (read about the problem in internet reviews) to have pumping system failures that cause the unit to lose its prime. There are a number of fixes suggested, none of which seem to be permanent. The problem is a design defect created when Keurig tried to make the pump motor quieter and only managed to undersize it for its intended task. If you're lucky, the problem will occur during your warranty and Keurig will replace it. Otherwise, be prepared to frequently unplug and restart the unit, specially after you add water. It does make good coffee and the wide variety of available K cups is a plus. Hopefully, this problem will be fixed in future models."
2,Designed obsolescence,"This is my second Keurig single cup coffee maker. The first was the platinum model and I am convinced that they have a designed obsolescence of around 13 months. I really like the convenience of the single cup as I probably brew 4-5 cups per day. I think you have to either accept the fact that using these machines cost $15/month as a replacement cost. Unfortunately, looking at reviews of other K-cup compatible coffee makers they have the same issues."
2,"Works great for six months, then breaks (have had three!)","First off, let me add that when I had my Keurig I regularly descaled it as is recommended in the directions. I made at most three cups a day. This is certainly a convenient item, the downfall is that at MOST they have lasted me six months each (I've purchased 3 over the course of about two years). When contacting the manufacturer I am told that I can send in my machine for replacement, which I did the first and second time. However, they continue to break and there is no warranty on the replacement they send. Considering how expensive these are and how expensive the k-cups are, it just isn't worth it in my opinion."
1,Have fun,"Pump fail, water seals fail, heating fails. K -cups are $$$ and not recycle friendly.I'm on my 2nd one replaced under warranty with a downgraded model.Sorry this is not the future ."
1,Run away from this one as fast as you can!,"My first Keurig single cup brewing system lasted just a little over three months. I purchased another system on April 16, this one stopped working on May 8. The water stopped pumping again and I ended up with my second VERY expensive paper weight. The $8.00 coffee maker I purchased two years ago at Goodwill works so much better than this Keurig. Perhaps those customer who are giving this a five star are still in the ""honey moon"" phase of using this brewing system. In time I will bet that their system will also stop working. Please follow my advise and the advise of all the others who have given this a one star rating. run away from this one as fast as you can! If I could give this a -10 star rating that is how I would truely rate this product."
1,Been through 2 of these...,"Great idea.... BUT, after about 2 months of use the coffee maker begins to break down.. This model has three different selections for amount of coffee; 6, 8 and 10 oz. (I believe.) Both of my B60s began to brew less and less coffee with each selection. Currently, when I press the 10 oz button, I get about 3 oz of coffee, and with the 8 oz I get about 2 oz of coffee. Thus, I have to brew three of four times to get a big cup of coffee. (the standard travel mug)With the amount of money that this unit cost, I am willing to now call it a $100 piece of junk. Please do not buy this unit! I know people with Keurig products, so I might try another unit, but I have also been called a fool in times past."
1,"Starts great, ends poorly","Length:: 0:54 MinsThe Keurig Special Edition coffee maker was great at first. Great coffee! But a year in, and the machine does not work. The morning is frustrating enough...getting ready for work, fighting traffic, but to spend 20 minutes trying to get the machine to spurt out coffee is not what anyone requests from a 150.00 coffee maker.Right now I have tried to get to give me a cup of coffee. The only upside is that I bought it at Kohls..who happily has a worry free return policy. I am returning the machine and getting a refund. I'll search for a new way to have a cup of coffee without the stress.Bottom line: Do not buy this machine. In trying to discover what is wrong with the machine...or spending a lot of time cleaning out the water line with vinegar, I have discovered on line that other people have the same problem with the machine. The water tubes are super narrow and get calcified, even if like me, you use bottled water.Do not buy it!"
1,Not a fan,"I'm not a fan. Its a cute toy, but I'll take regular brewed. I like large, multiple cups of coffee in the morning. The Keurig, while remaining ""on demand"" needs new pods for every cup, which cost more $$$. The ""large"" size is my idea of a normal cup size, not ""large"". Using the ""large"" size setting gives me a watery tasting cup no matter if I use a dark roast or not.Sorry not for me."
4,"Good coffee maker, expensive k-cups","I really like this coffeemaker. It is convenient and the coffee is fresh. Cons are that the k-cups are expensive and not recyclable. There is a reusable filter out there, I have not tried it, but reviews say it is good but doesn't last long. All in all I really like this coffeemaker"
1,Good... if you like drinking coffee flavored spray paint...,I just purchased the B60 from a retail store today and I am having the same problem that a lot of folks are. It smells so much like plastic with a toxic undertone that it is reminiscent of a spray paint smell. I did not spend my hard earned money to have to spend two weeks flushing out the machine with countless bottles of vinegar and/or wait for the company to send me a new unit. I am returning it to the place I purchased it from tomorrow with receipt in hand. Buyer beware!
2,LOVE the coffee! HATE the machine!!,I am on my second machine and about to call so I can get a third (which will probably be garbage too)!My first machine wouldn't brew a full cup after a few months usage.Now my second machine shuts off after brewing one cup.I really do love the coffee but the machine is a piece of garbage!
5,WE LOVE THIS PURCHASE,"We received a Keurig B40 as a gift. We LOVED it SO MUCH, that I decided to take the B40 to my office and buy a B60 (with LED clock and timer) for our home. The convenience is UNBELIEVABLE. Yes, of course, the coffee costs more because of the need to buy K-Cups; but there is absolutely NO WASTE. This brewer is PERFECT for a household like ours. My husband drinks ONLY unflavored coffee. I enjoy both flavored and unflavored coffee. My huband drinks NO coffee in the evening. I like ONE cup of decaf after dinner. You can brew EXACTLY what you want, when you want it, on only the amount you really want. This is one of our favorite purchases in a LONG TIME!"
3,"Great machine, not so great coffee","The B60 is a well designed and constructed single cup coffee maker that makes mediocre tasting coffee. Buy the Tassimo if you want full-bodied, great tasting single cup coffee (and cappuccino!). Only consider the Keurig if you like your coffee to be weak ""diner"" variety coffee.The B60 is probably the most quiet, well-constructed single cup coffee maker on the market. I have owned one for over a year and have had no problems with it. I have used at least six or seven varieties of coffee in the machine but have never been satisfied with the coffee taste.I recently went to a bed and breakfast that had a Braun Tassimo and immediately went out and bought one to replace my Keurig B60! The Tassimo is cheaply made, takes longer to brew, can't use large coffee mugs, and is somewhat noisier than the Keurig. The Tassimo makes much better tasting coffee and I'm willing to suffer its shortcomings for good coffee."
5,Keurig Coffee Maker,"I LOVE Keurig coffee machines, and have had the B-50, B-60 and B-70 units. All work equally well, although I prefer the B-70 as it holds more water. Each cup of coffee or tea is just perfectly made. This, with the speed of preparation and virtually no clean-up, makes Keurig my favorite coffee machine. You will love it too."
4,Handy and Dandy,"My daughters drink regular, we drink decaf coffee. Some like it strong, some like it weak so it's hard to please everyone and the Keurig will allow them to pick their brew and have an enjoyable cup of coffee. We enjoy it already but it is a bit noisy and the base plate that the cup sets on vibrates during brewing but it is a minor annoyance."
5,fantastic,I can be sipping on a cup of coffee in less time than it took to get water started in my old coffee maker. I love the fresh taste of every cup. I ran the same k-cup for 2 cups (back to back) and they both were wonderful. I can't wait to try the teas and hot chocolate....yummy!
5,Just what we wanted!,"This is exactly what we wanted. I got this for my husband for his birthday after having a Tassimo machine for about 6 months and we love this so much more. We love the options of K-Cups that you can get and it works GREAT! He's an all day coffee drinker so it's such a plus that the coffee doesn't just sit all day and he can make a cup as he needs it! I love that I can make my tea and cider with it too. It'll definitely come in handy as we have a baby due any day now and between needing the quick coffee for energy and the numerous visitors we have planned, it'll be great to have!"
2,The infamous PRIME issue,"I was prepared to give the Keurig a good review until I started getting the infamous PRIME message showing up on a regular basis. My Keurig is only a month old and I brew 2 to 3 cups daily. After researching online I've found it to be a common issue and customers typically call Keurig customer support and get a new machine to replace the defective one. That will be my next step. I think the quality of the coffee is fine. The K-Cups are convenient, but expensive. I use an Ekobrew filter so I can use regular ground coffee and that works great. It's a shame to have replace a defective unit so soon. Fortunately my Bunn machine at work has been rock solid for over 3 years."
5,excellent coffee maker,"Had this particular model for over a year now. Has worked perfectly since day one. I recently bought the single cup filter to use your own ground coffee and it also works great. No leaks, brews fast and perfect every time. The Kcups can be found at your local grocery, target and of course bed bath and beyond."
2,Keurig B60,"Bought my Keurig in May of 2010 and loved it from day one untill it died in Sept of 2011... five months after the warrenty had run out. It seemed to have become clogged even though I had been diligent in performing monthly cleanings on it using vinigar. Last September I started getting nothing more than a trickle of coffee from it. Tried the suggested tips on the Keurig site with no results. I ran CLR through it as suggested online but got no better results than with the vinigar. I emailed Keurig and got no response. I did a limited dismantling following online instructions with no results. I don't know about anyone else but based on my personal experience, I've chosen not to take a chance on Keurig again. Won't even take advantage of the points I accumalated purchasing their coffee to get one half price. I'll take my chances on another brand. I've given it two star only because it was great while it worked."
2,Coffee Maker Lasted 2 Months Then Died!,I was really excited when I brought this coffee maker home. Loved using it. Then starting a few weeks back the coffee came out luke warm and less volume and slowly died. Very disappointed especially when I feel I paid a high amount. This coffee maker gets a thumbs down!
1,Don't Even Consider,"Great when it works, which is about 6 weeks per unit. I was about to request my THIRD unit, when I decided I had had about enough of the Keurig brand name. The first one lasted about 6 weeks. The second replacement they sent last about the same. The unit will function if you unplug it from the wall after each cup. (If you need the exercise, this is the unit for you.)I like the K-cup idea and will look elsewhere for a unit that will last longer than a few weeks. Nothing with the name Keurig on it will ever find a place in my home again."
2,Not working after less than a year,"Well, I was warned, but I still bought one anyway. Less than a year and it has gone blank. My plugs are good, machine makes good coffee as long as you don't use it longer than 10 months. I will be calling them tomorrow, but because I didn't send in my warranty card, they probably won't fix it. I will let you know. I need my coffee!"
2,3rd machine in three months,"I'm giving this product two stars only because I love the Keurig concept. I love the coffee, the convenience, and the variety of k-cups. Realistically though, the quality of the product makes it worthy of only one star. I was actually impressed to see some people getting 15 months out of the B-60. We have had to return our first two machines after a month of use each, and are now on our third.I can't completely say that I don't recommend this product, because I like it enough to keep replacing the duds. My advice is, keep the receipt and keep the box, it makes returns and exchanges much easier."
1,Dont waste your money,"Keurig model B-60. I am very disappointed with this machine. I spent $150 for it, have owned it for 2 1/2 years with light use, about 4-5 cups per day and not used every day either. It started leaking after 1 year. I managed to control that for the next 1 1/2 year along with some minor issues like occasional erratic behaviors, small cups erratic menu readings etc.... It just stopped working yesterday, no lights or anything. I will not spend another dime on one of these machines and neither will any of my friends. At least 4 of my coworkers have similar issues. I am going to spread the word that these things are JUNK! For the amount of money we have spent on these and the expensive k-cups they should last for years! I am a very dissatisfied customer!"
2,Frustratingly unreliable,"I bought my Keurig about 20 months ago. It worked fine for the first 10 months and then the problems started happening. Basically it won't work. I descaled it and left it unplugged and it worked fine for 3 more months. Then the problem reappeared and they are reoccurring with increased frequency. Today I think I have to read it its last rites. It's a pity, because I like the coffee and the convenience even though they come with a rather steep price. Now I am stuck with several boxes of K-cups and wondering whether to buy a new machine or not. I gave this product two stars for the quality of coffee and the convenience. The price and the frustrating unreliability of this pricey machine prevent me from awarding more stars. My advise: stay away from this machine."
1,Pay attention to bad reviews,"I got my B60 2 years ago. I like the idea of one cup brewers and the ease of use with K-cups.But about 6 months ago, it stopped making full cups on a consistent basis. I tried cleaning, I tried the paper clip in the nozzle trick, I tried them all and it still does not work properly.Keurig only warrants their units for 30 days. This consistent problem shows up much later and purchasers are stuck with having to buy new coffee makers.For those of you who want a product that lasts, don't buy Keurig."
1,Stopped working in 3 weeks AND cancer-warning in their manual,"I hope this review helps others. I wished I had read the reviews here before my purchase. I too loved the convenience of the machine -- no question abt that. However, after daily use for 3 weeks the prime pump no longer works. When I opened the user manual to trouble shoot I was very surprised to see Keurig's Warning abt lead and chemicals causing cancer . Personally, this information should be posted on the box -- in my opinion.Anyway, I am returning my unit and I hope this review helps others."
1,Garbage!,"Just like numerous others have said, mine worked for about 4 months, and then died -- even though I followed all instructions on maintenance and cleaning. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Most of the good reviews here are likely from those who have only owned it for a month, and are excited about it -- because it is great while it works...but for this price, it should last more than a few months."
5,Bliss,I am in love with this coffee maker! I love being able to have several different types of coffees on hand. You can have several varieties for your guests. My husband does not drink coffee so I love the fact that I can make one cup at a time. No more waste that I would have making a full cup.
2,Original product release was better,"When they first released the Keurig the 2 volume of liquid choices were 6oz and 8oz. Newer models dispence more liquid 8oz and 10oz thereby effecting the overall flavor of your coffee.Purchased one way back in the day, and decided to buy another and after having a bad cup of coffee inspected both models closely discovered the changes in the newer model. I like the 6oz option, maybe they should offer 3 volume choices in stead of 2. . ."
4,awesome,We had one of these in my office on the ship. I'm not a big coffee drinker but when I did it worked great. We had all kinds of people from different department coming over to use our coffee maker.I bought one for my mother who lives alone and does not need to brew a whole pot. She loves it but has complained about needing to put 40oz of vinegar in it to clean it.
2,Poor Product,The Keurig was great while it lasted. I purchased 2 Keurigs and they both only lasted about 15 months. I bought the second one thinking that it was just bad luck with the first one. It seems that wasn't true. My second Keurig lasted only a short while also. Anyone who has posted a positive review for this product either has had their Keurig less than a year or they work for Keurig. This was a horrible product and the company isn't willing to stand behind their product. I think that should tell you something right there.
2,eh...,"we asked for a coffee maker for Christmas. we got this one. at first we were so excited because it's so fancy and they also gave us a big box of trial coffees. well those ran out - and they were ok, but in order to make a strong cup of coffee, we had to use 2 k-cups in one cup, which makes buying those much more expensive. and it still wasn't that strong (Even with the boldest blend) so we bought the solo-fill cup so that we could buy whatever coffee we wanted and put it in there. works great - highly recommend buying the solo fill - but it still doesn't make a very strong cup of coffee. it's also a pain in the butt to empty and wash the solo-fill out after every use. kind of defeats the point of the quick simple single cup machine. but buying all those k-cups is just too expensive. all in all...i wish we just had a regular old coffee pot."
5,I love these!,I've had one of these for about the last 5 years. I gave this one as a gift and it was a big hit. Nothing better for fresh coffee all the time.
2,Love the Keurig System - Quality Problems with this Brewer,"I have been using Keurig K-Cups for 6 years. Absolutely love the ""system"". We have a total of 8 machines between home, cabin, and office. When the oldest machine went out after 6 years, we purchase another B60 from amazon. The unit just didn't work right. Keurigs customer support was terrible. We are talking about coffee. My wife is not fun without coffee. Being a Prime Member, I ordered another machine to replace the defective one. Either we would figure out how to get the customer service or we would just scrap in.The second unit is worse than the first. Now I have two defective machines. Keurig won't give a response to warranty. The first is past the return period from Amazon.I'm not going to switch from Keurig, but please up your quality and/or service."
2,Not built for the long haul,"I sparingly used this Keurig only for myself but the machine stopped working after two years. I contacted Keurig customer service and they told me my problem was 'spontaneous brewing' and could not be fixed. They offered to replace my unit for $97. The machine was just pouring out cold water upon being turned on, unable to brew and shutting itself off. I have no idea what caused this as I always took care of the machine and didn't use it very often, so there's no way I wore it out. The Keurig at my office needed replaced a few months ago. From my digging around, it seems two years is about as long as these machines will last. They produce okay quality coffee when they are working, but if you buy one, don't expect it to last that long. Patents have started to expire for Keurig so I hope a greater selection of single serve machines will enter the market. Maybe we should wait for those and not give Keurig anymore money for such a low quality product."
1,No it came far from meeting our expectation.,"Sadly, our 149 B60 stopped working after (gasp~!) 2 brief weeks! We were soooooo disappointed but thank God Keurig has a 1 year warranty; so we got another 1 last week."
5,love this coffee maker,This makes a wonderful cup of coffee....we purchased the k-cup insert that allows us to use our own ground coffee...to be able to have a fresh.. hot... cup of coffee in under 30 seconds is wonderful...without the need to make an entire pot. We now own two...one for the house in Michigan and one for the house in Florida....we like it that much...I would... and... have... most certainly recommened this Keurig B60 to anyone thinking about making the purchase..you wont be disappointed..also the price on Amazon is much lower than I found in the stores.
5,I was shocked,If you enjoy a REAL good cup of coffee you have to get this system. Not only is it easy to use but makes coffee a new experience at home. I have gone to gourmet coffee shops and their coffee cannot compare. Keurig system is a real treat and well worth the money. My friends werein awe especially with the German Chocolate Cake flavor. Also kudos goes to Amazon that was awesome in a timely delivery.
5,"Great Coffee - any flavor, quick!","The wife and I enjoy waking up and having a perfect cup of coffee in the morning without the fuss and mess of preparing 10 cups that we won't consume all at once. The Keurig has simplified our mornings by allowing us to brew any flavor we desire, independent of each others likes. If I want coffee, and the misses wants to sink into a cup of tea, it's as easy as placing the right K-Cup into the Keurig.We also own an art gallery in New Hope PA. When people come in to browse, one of the first things we do upon them entering, is offer them a cup of coffee or tea, especially in the Winter months.Even they are more amazed at our hospitality and willingness to brew fresh hot beverages for then in a matter of 60 seconds. Make us look like champs! We wouldn't part with our Keurig for anything."
3,Died at 22 months,"Had the maker for a year. Started to brew half a cup. They walked me through cleaning the machine with a tooth prick. I did this and descaled it about 8 times. Worked fine. Last month, it had trouble staying on. Last week, it gasped its last breath. Will not come on for nothing. Customer service rep said it must be my outlet. Tried to tell her my regular coffee maker (Technivorm Moccamaster, GREAT maker) was plugged into the same outlet. Did not compute with her. She then said since it was out of warranty, she could sell me for a new one for $97. This $50 less than Amazon which to me, is no big deal.Great single cup coffee make, just does NOT hold up."
4,Keurig II,This product is as expected. A super product. My one concern is longevity. Everybody who has been a Keurig customer has bought more than one. My last one lasted just over a year.FYI
4,register register register,"I received the smaller cheaper version as a gift for christmas 2011, and it already quit working. I never registered it since I thought I needed a receipt and tried to take apart the unit myself to fix it (not advised, I didn't get far) but it worked for a few weeks after. Anyway I didn't even try to get it warrantied. Received this unit, shipped with box and all accessories including 5 k-kups seems to work so far. I was able to register it online for warranty and 2 free boxes of coffee, hope it outlasts the other one. Would give 5 stars but I just got it and it is refurbished"
2,Died at 18 months.,This brewer worked great until about 18 months after I purchased it - now suddenly it won't turn on. Waiting to hear from Keurig customer service to find out if they'll replace it.
5,b 60 special edition,"Works excellent. Since it makes only one cup at a time, it saves making a whole pot at a time an throwing several cups away."
3,"2 Months later, Quit Working","I have had my Keurig for 2 months and its quit working already....I loved it while it worked though, but now I have to unplug it, replug it, wait for it to warm up again, then try pushing the brew button, sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes to finally kick in and brew a cup!"
1,ONE WORD: CRAP!,"want a coffee maker that works? then look elsewhere. i have bought many coffee makers, expresso machines, and NEVER had one NOT work, or work randomly, or when it feels like it like this one.press medium cup, get small cup. turn on, it turns itself off after 2 minutes. and this after 2-3 weeks. unforunately i bought this as a gift in early dec. and problems started in mid-jan. too late to return!next time follow all the neg. reviews and your gut. when any product has 50+ 1 stars it is because it has many issues, so avoid, avoid, avoid!"
4,Keurig B60,"I purchased the B60 and it is a great machine, very efficent and nice looking too. It is surprisingly easy to use no headaches here. It has great features and a good selection of coffee and tea k-cup flavors. I am not as pleased as I would like to be because Keurig does not make Cappucino K-cups. The Cappucino coffee flavored ones are not cutting it at all they are horrible. This distresses me because Tassimo does although it is a 2 step process and Senseo makes Cappucino pods that are great, there is not a big deal with putting powder milk in a K-cup to create this maybe Keurig is lazy I don't know. If I was aware of this I probably would not have bought this and ended up with the Tassimo which costs more."
5,Well worth the money for a great cup of coffee,I recently purchased this coffee maker and love it. I love the ease of getting a fresh coffee house cup of coffee at home. There is a large variety of K-Cups available. I even picked up a battery operated frother from Bed Bath and Beyond to enhance my coffee experience. I have owned many coffeee makers but this is by far the best one I have ever owned. It was worth the price I paid for it. In just three months it will pay for itself by not having to stop at the local store for a quick cup of coffee.
1,Enjoy it while it lasts.,"Our first B60 lasted 3 months before it started malfunctioning. It's replacement has been with us for 3 weeks and just quit. From speaking to other owners and a representative from Kohls where we purchased this, it's clear that it's a matter of WHEN they will fail, not IF. Hold onto your receipt and the original packaging - you will need it."
1,It all comes down to the coffee...,"I really wanted to love this machine- it brews coffee SO fast- fast enough to make serving multiple cups no issue, the water temp is perfect, there are so many flavors I was excited about.But the coffee was WEAK. How can you afford to pay $150 and extra money for pods when the coffee isn't any good? Even the bold flavors! It's NOT a roast issue! You should be able to get a medium roasted coffee that's not the color of tea (even on the smallest size setting)- it reminds me of coffee from Denny's. And I'm really not a coffee snob either- my favorite brand is folgers. But this doesn't even come close to an avg. cup of folgers!"
2,3.5 years of Keurig experience,We have now owned two Keurigs. We bought our first one three and a half years ago. It worked great for two years. And then over the course of a week or two everything seemed to be going wrong until it just would not brew coffee. We bought another one. that one made it about a year and a half before the same thing happened. If you like the ease and convenience of single cup brewing you had better have a back up coffee maker. We are now using our $30 Mr Coffee. It has always worked. Be warned that these Keurig machines are for the most part a $150 disposable coffee maker. We will not buy another one.
4,"Keurig B60,,,","It has been a while but I believe the shipper was Handy House. They provided VERY fast shipping and I would deal with them again.About the B60 unit,it does everything it states. It is great for a person who does not want to make a big pot of coffee every time.Only complaint would be the ""10 second"" pump cycle as is a bit noisy. The unit is quick and fast."
2,Great Coffee But NOISY Machine...Get The B70 Instead for $30 More...,"The coffee is great from a Keurig machine...I love the coffee. I have a B70 which I love. I recently purchased a B60 for my office and was very disappointed by the loud noise it makes when it sucks the water into the reservoir which is after every cup you brew. The footprint or size of the actual machine isn't much smaller if any at all for the B60 from the B70. In fact, the B70 looks shorter to me on the top. For about $30 more, I would recommend getting the 70 instead. You will get a little more water holding ability in ounces, get 5 brew sizes but most importantly, you will get a real quiet machine....oh, did I mention I LOVE the coffees that this machine brews...and, no clean up which is the best part !"
4,I Like it,It does have some drawbacks like if you use a big cup like me and my wife then you are going to get a half cup and till I get the hang of it I do not seem to know when it is out of water I just stand there and we me and the machine stare at each outer till I check the water and sure enough it out but it is simple to refill.I like the fact that the coffee is fresh tasting fast to recover for another cup and I do not have to drink coffee that was made last night
5,Love my Keurig,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas last year. When I opened it I thought oh great, another useless appliance to take up counter space. I couldn't have been more wrong! I have used it every day since I got it. My daughters have them too, and they love them. I just use it for coffee, but my son makes hot chocolate with it. There are dozens of drinks available-even hot apple cider! The cost of using k cups works out to about 50 cents a cup-cheaper than McDonalds. Now I am looking into reusable cups to make it even cheaper. All I can say is, if I had to give it up I would certainly miss it."
1,"When reading reviews, check to see how long reviewer has owned it","I love the convenience of the Keurig brewer - when it works. However, it frequently starts making only partial cups or no cups. I'm on my second now in a year.Keurig claims that the problem is ""scaling"" - deposits inside the brewer caused by hard water. They recommend that you ""descale"" it by running lots of vinegar through it as if you were brewing coffee with vinegar. That seems to work, but only for a day or two, if that long. Then the problems resume.The brewer is poorly designed. One shouldn't have to be descaling it, and the descaling, when done, ought to last longer than a few days.I'm going to try calling Keurig again tomorrow, but will probably go back to the old faithful coffee pot."
2,Disposable Coffee and Coffemaker,"I bought this so that I could brew my own coffee varieties. I have had it for a little over a year and the pump is shot. It takes 3 tries to brew one cup of coffee. I will use it until it dies completely, then trash it, and NEVER buy another one. I have had a Tassimo for 4 years with no problems! Did I mention that I barely brew 5 cups a month on the Keurig."
2,Poor,This is the SECOND Keurig machine we have purchased and are having issues with this one too. Brews 1/2 cups and takes forever to brew...NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!
2,Keeps Breaking,I initially LOVED my Keurig. After just 4 months it kept on giving me half cups. I descale and do everything that they say and it goes back to short-cupping me a day later. it got to the point that it never gave me a full cup. Keurig is going to replace the unit but I've wasted so many K cups on it. I wish I never wasted the money on the coffee pot then over $150 on coffee for the past 6 months. In the end the traditional coffee pot is still better.
2,Noisy and can't get parts,"This products is pretty good, but the pump for the water is very noisy. Also, the cheap plastic piece that holds the K-cup broke and the company doesn't sell them - E-Bay has them for $35."
2,Mechanical Junk,"Lasted 8 months, at which time we learned that our daughter's lasted 11 months. That's a lot of money for junk! They won't get any more of my money."
4,Love it,This machine makes you want cold weather to appear so you can have a valid excuse to make a cup of something!
3,coffee pot,"Funny I found this at walmart a month later,,, and 25 bucks cheaper! Very noisy as well but when this one breaks I will buy another one!"
3,kurig coffee maker,i like this product but have a ? do i leave the coffee maker on or will it come on automatically if i set the timer on and it only is making a 1/2 cup
1,"With such serious relability posts, I decided to buy another brand","After reviewing many of the customer reviews, I noticed that the rating are mostly either 5 star or 1 star.The 1 star relates to reliability. The Keurig K-cup systems seem to have a serious reliability issue that Keurig does not appear to be addressing. I have always believed Keurig to be a top quality brand company but apparently this has changed. I have decided not to buy Keurig any longer. I feel if one product line has serious quality issues, then there is an overall serious company quality issue. SO buyers, beware, if you buy the Keurig and it fails, you have been advised.As related to the B60 series, (and other B seriies), the following seem true.The product makes great coffee, when it works.This product is extremely convenent, when it works.This product is attractive, but a waste of space when it quites working."
1,Killing the environment with plastic!,Don't buy this even if you think it's convient how hard is it to make coffee in the morning the old fashioned way ? Besides you waste sooo much plastic manufacturing those little K-cups that are NOT bio degradable and sit around filling our land fills while you got 5 extra minutes out of your morning to pick your nose or something not important. Don't buy stuff like this that just feed our landfills and someone else's pocket book.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE,"I am not picky about my coffee. But these coffee taste nothing like coffee at all. You know the kind of goodfeeling you get after you drink a cup of coffee. I tried all kinds of flavor that this brand sells, none of them taste like real coffee. It is very noisy and all the coffee that you must buy are way too expensive. At one point the machine got so noisy I called customer service, needles to say they told me that it is normal and ignore my request for a replacement or service. Since the coffee was so expensive, at one point I used some coupon code to buy their coffee, but they erased my order without letting me know and it is all because they did not like it that I was using a 20% off coupon. The site took the coupon, but quietly took the order out without telling me.I guess some(if not most) of the good review from Amazon was written by people who works at the Keurig.Don't believe them, I wish I believed the negative reviews before I purchase this product."
1,Don't buy,"Don't buy unless you have good patience to deal with customer service one a year. I have had 3 machines in 3 years! It is very clear that the engineering of this product needs to be improved. The company is great about sending out another one, but they have no process in place to recycle the broken machines therefore they all go into the garbage dump. We all need to be more conscious about what we are throwing away and if I have thrown away 3 in 3 years, I can't imagine how many thousands of these machines are in our land fills."
3,maybe it's just me,I received my Keurig B60 today. Very easy to set up and get started. I tried my first cup of extra bold dark magic. I used the 'mug' setting and it only filled my cup about 3/4 of the way. I use a Longaberger mug so it's not one of those huge mugs. Maybe it's just me but the coffee tasted a lot like instant coffee to me. I had such high hopes for this coffee machine and I will try the variety pack to see if this gets better. But for now I don't feel this is any better then my 4-cup Mr. Coffee. I read all the positive ratings this machine has received which makes me wonder why I'm the only one who is not all that impressed. It is very convient though. The design is modern and it also makes a nice blue night light.
1,It all comes down to the coffee...,"I really wanted to love this machine- it brews coffee SO fast- fast enough to make serving multiple cups no issue, the water temp is perfect, there are so many flavors I was excited about.But the coffee was WEAK. How can you afford to pay $150 and extra money for pods when the coffee isn't any good? Even the bold flavors! It's NOT a roast issue!

And I'm really not a coffee snob either- my favorite brand is folgers. But this doesn't even come close to an avg. cup of folgers!I'm sad and confused! Is it just meeee?"
1,WEAKER THAN WEAK coffee makes very bad coffee,Wow Could not get over how weak the coffee came out.tried and tried to get some flavor out of it. NOT possible.Even tried the my kcup that was worse. says to put 2-3 TABLESPOONS in filter. Put in 3 teaspoons and it was FULL...tried lowest setting makes about half a cup still weak. Had i put it in a glass i could read newspaper through it..could not return that piece of junk fast enough...
2,"worked well at first, but...","We loved the unit up until recently. Just in the last month or so (after owning it for one year) the coffee has been extremely weak, almost to the point of not bothering to use the unit. We've called Keurig and they told us to clean it. We did, but still weak coffee. They've yet to get back to us. We loved it up until recently, but are about to switch to something else. When the unit worked well, the coffee was a bit on the weak side, but good. Lately, however, it's been way too weak for us."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"You can't go wrong with this machine. It is easy to use, stylish, and makes a darn good cup of cofee!...The only draw back, if you cnsider this one, is it is a bit noisy while it is brewing. Then again it only takes about 30 sec to brew one cup of coffee."
1,Amazing scam!,"What they don't tell you about this one cup coffee make is that one cup is about all you get. Let's create a product that will die exactly when the warranty expires. I'm absolutely convinced that the Keurig coffee maker is programmed to stop after a certain amount of cups (i.e. 1,000 cups). I have owned a number of coffee makers and usually there is a warning that it is about to go. There was no warning with this brilliant device. One day it is working fine and the next day nothing. I have no doubt the manufacturer is hoping that you will get caught with a huge box of K-cups so that you will have no option but to buy another Keurig coffee maker. This product is despicable.Maybe this would not be so bad if you didn't pay for or five timesas much as a normal coffee maker which makes it a ridiculous product. If you have a big box of K-cups cut your losses - the coffee is better than instant but not better than drip. Buyers beware of this one."
2,"Keurig review/ March, 2011","Pros: This coffee maker makes great tasting coffee, compared to brewing the same exact coffee in a traditional coffee maker.Cons: The cups are very expensive. You are much better off putting your own coffee in the optional Keurig filter, but it takes more time and only results in 1 cup at a time.The unit only lasted just over a year. I only used filtered water, to avoid hard water build up. Like so many other people, the machine started to make noises and put out smaller cups of coffee. I descaled the machine with vinegar, as suggested, even though I should not have had to. Shortly afterwards, the machine would not take up any water at all and it died.There was a lot of money invested in a machine that dies so quickly. It can't even be taken apart to clean thoroughly. They need to make the parts more user friendly to troubleshoot on your own. I wish that I could find an alternative machine that puts out the same flavor!"
1,Didn't work right out of the box!!!,"My husband and I bought this brewer at BJ's for my mom and gave to her at our early x'mas celebration this week. To our amazement, it didn't work! When following the setup instructions, when we pressed the power button, cold water just starts coming out. No warming period, just cold water immediately being dispensed. We called cust svc and found out it's called ""spontaneous brewing"" which tells us it happens often enough that they have a name for it!Talk about embarrassing! We normally don't spend that much, but it was something she really wanted and would never spend the money on herself.Keurig is supposed to be sending her a new one. We'll see what happens with that one. I would have returned it, but I was in a different state with no BJ's nearby.The sad part is, my husband and I were going to buy one. Not now! Not worth the money. We went back to using the $15 coffee maker my mom bought 15 years ago. It still works just fine!Don't waste your money!"
2,disappointment,after one months use machine is not working. i was very happy - was making 5 to 6 cups a day. very disappointed in brakdown
2,"Overall good quality, but not for long","We bought this brewer back in August 2006 and it worked pretty good till recently. I noticed that it would ignore your choice of the cup size, and always make middle size. Turned out that cause of the problem is the middle button. It would not pop up after you push it. I think it's due to the fact that it's made of a cheap plastic. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it now, and it's very disappointing that it happened after only five month of use. Buy at your own risk."
5,Top-notch!,"I've had mine for over a year and I love it. It's indispensable! You can use K-Cups or regular ground coffee with this, which cuts down on cost (if you drink a lot of coffee, the K-Cups can get pricey) and increases variety. You can make different-sized cups and they always come out warm, but immediately-drinkable.This machine is extremely easy to set up and move, and I've had no technical issues of any kind with it. I haven't shopped around for something like this, but I knew I wanted a Keurig because I perceived this brand to be the best. I haven't been disappointed!This is a great investment for a coffee drinker like me!"
2,Short cups quickly; good customer service,"I first received this coffee maker as a gift in December 2009. After approx. 5 months, it began short cupping. Called customer service and they were very helpful. Initially thought it was my lack of de-scaling that created the problem, but after receiving my second machine, I realize it is a manufacturer's problem. The second machine also began short cupping soon after I received it. Again, customer service came through and replaced the machine. Had my third machine for 7 months and it is short cupping again, even after I spent the extra $18 dollars for a filter, use only bottled water (their recommendation) and de-scale. Not sure what customer service will do this time, but I would not give this machine as a gift or recommend anyone purchase it."
1,Two cups then dead!,"Worthless product with faulty power supply only made two cups of coffee before failing. Received as a gift, I will never spend more money with this company."
1,Unreliable choice,"This coffee maker is very annoying. It will not prime the water unless we take the reservoir off and shake it before each cup. We complained to Keurig but they were not helpful. We love the single cup, but will never buy this product again. Please spare yourself a big disappointment and do not buy this coffee maker. I read a similar complaint before I made this purchase."
1,Great for a year,"I Purchased two, one for my parents, and the other for my apartment. They both brewed great coffee for about 13 months. Mine stopped working then like time worked my parents stopped 3 weeks after. I suggest you purchase the smaller one. It seems to much spending 150 when it will only work for about a year."
1,Worst product I've ever bought !!!!,I was so disappointed when I got this out of the box and used it!! I have yet to make a cup of coffee out of it that doesn't have a horrible chemical after taste!! I don't know if its the plastic tubing leaking toxins into it or if it's the kcups which are loaded with the artificial sweetener sucralose. But I tried to contact the company and I just got brushed aside. I then called to get a refund for the disgusting k cups that aren't supposed to be diet but contain sucralose and the bitch told me she couldn't refund me I would have to try to return it to the store. I liked the idea of how quick and convenient this product is but I can't get over the taste
2,BROKE AFTER 2 YEARS...,"FOR THE TWO YEARS IT WORKED, I LOVED IT. WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER AS IT MAY HAPPEN AGAIN. SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING I BUY DOES NOT LAST. SAD."
4,Great product,Product came as advertized. Works as described. Made a great gift and the receivers are more than pleased. I Recommend purchase.
3,"Good coffee, poor longevity.","We have had this model since Dec 2010 and in March 2012 it bit the dust with no warning. It was problematic on Sunday morning, but on Monday it won't even power on. It's out of warranty, so I'm out of luck.The coffee is decent, the k-cups are readily available, and the variety is excellent. Even at 60 - 70 cents per k-cup, it's a lot cheaper than stopping off on the way to work every morning.I like the system, but reliability is a real issue with these machines."
2,Unreliable product - don't waste your money!,"I received one as a Christmas present last year, which malfunctioned within a month (would power up then turn off for no reason). The company gladly sent a replacement which malfunctioned after about 2 months (made a grinding noise and would only brew a few drops). Tried again with a 3rd which worked great for about 6 months, then totally quit - won't power up at all. I used filtered water every time, so tap water was not the issue.It's convenient when it works, but this needs to be refined into a much more reliable product. Also, I was only able to find 1-2 K cup varieties that didn't brew weak coffee that tasted like hot water. I tried dozens."
3,Could have been a 5...................,............ one flaw is that it leaks water. Other than that it is a great coffee maker.
3,"NIce idea, but company needs better quality control!","I love the idea of this coffee maker - only having to make one cup. I also have the extra filter to place my own coffee in. My daughter works at Starbucks, so I can't beat the price of the beans (free). When using the little filter, you have to be careful to grind the beans very fine, or the coffee will come out really weak.The major drawback with this machine is the problem of ""priming."" I have read reviews elsewhere where this is happening after a few weeks to a few months of use. The machine will think it is out of water in the reservoir; however, it is not. It gives the message ""prime."" I have to turn it off, remove the reservoir, unplug the machine, and then put it all back together. So far that works to reset it. Other users have not been so lucky, and have to send it back to the manufacturer. The new machines that they receive have the same problem, so I am assuming the company hasn't figured out a solution."
1,Two B60s croaked in one month,"We bought our first Keurig brewer - a B60 - in october. Within two weeks the ""prime"" feature broke. We had to prime it 1-3 times after every cup before it would brew another cup. Customer Service kindly sent us a replacement. We've had it about two weeks. This morning, after I made a cup of coffee, ""prime"" lit up on the screen and the same thing started happening. Customer Service walked me thru some steps and it seemed to be good to go. This afternoon I made a cup of coffee - and sure enough - ""prime"" lit up, the pump was trying to work, but the water would not go down in reservoir. I turned the brewer off and unplugged it. I actually had to do this three times before it was ready to brew again. Am very disappointed and will have to call Customer Service again. Does anyone know which one of these brewer models is actually the the most reliable one? I've been reading a number of reviews similar to mine."
1,To much Hype,I had my eye on one of these for a long time but thought they cost to much. I was finally able to get one and I was right. Had i paid full price I would be highly upset. The cups of coffee are not that big even when you select the largest size. The coffee is not that strong and honestly taste no different than a cup that was made in a $10 coffee pot. I would not waste your money.
1,"Fool me once shhame on you, Fool me twice....","I had mine for 18 months it broke. I only used filtered water and now its stop putting out water. Keurig said it was not repairable and they offered me a discount to buy another one. They want me to spend $100 on another coffeee pot that is only good for 18 months, REALLY?Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.NEVER BUY A KEURIG!"
3,Makes only enough coffee for 1/2 a normal mug,"Poor basic design concept. Before you buy any of Keurig's K-Cup coffee makers, take you kitchen measuring cup to see how much your normal coffee cup holds. My normal mugs hold 17 oz. Almost anyone's normal coffee mug is at least as big as a 16 oz ""Tall"" coffee. The largest of the B-60's 3 cup sizes is only 9 1/4 oz. The largest of the B70's 5 cup sizes is slightly larger at 11 1/4 oz. In summary you have to run the Keurig twice to get a normal mug of coffee.Keurig's new VUE model at $250 solves this problem by going up to 18 oz but costs a terrible price and uses different coffee packages."
1,No good after a year,"This worked great the first few months. About 6 months later it would start making the wrong size, or not working at all. Now, one year later the thing wont even turn on, I have tried switching outlets and everything and its dead. The manufacturer doesnt warranty anything after one year, go figure.... I wont buy another one!"
5,Great coffee maker,"This is the best coffee maker I have ever owned. Even though the k-cups are expensive, it is worth the price. This is perfect for those people who like to drink coffee at all different times of the day."
5,The Most Awesome Coffee Maker EVER!,"I have totally been missing out! I have looked at the Keurig Machines for a while now and finally broke down and bought one, I wish I had bought one a LONG time ago. This makes the best coffee perfect every time, you do not waste coffee if you just need one cup you just make one cup. I LOVE THIS MACHINE!"
1,Keurig is s****y coffee maker!,"I bought this B60 model and it did work for a while. But after barely 50 cups brewing, it stops working! The screen always showing ""No Ready"". I logon to Keurig's website trying to find a solution there, but nothing helpful except for a salesperson try to sell you the s****ing product new model. What a lousy product!I'll never buy it again, and will tell everyone around me about this s****ing company."
1,Junk,It works 50 percent of the time. It can't make hot chocolate. The k cup gets clogged and you just end up with a mess
3,"Great Coffee, Needs Maintenence","Makes great coffee, it's really nice to be able to have multiple types of coffee/tea/cocoa at one's finger tips.We have three B60 Special Keurig machines: home, work, in-laws, all have malfunctioned in some capacity. We've called the company and because we use well water we voided the warranty. The machine needs to be maintained often. Once a month I run 1/2 gallon of vinegar through it, clean all of the needs, the water syphon-- the works. If I don't the prime light comes on or the machine gets 'stuck' and will not draw the water/brew."
1,JUNK,I have had three and they all quit working within a few months.Now I'm stuck with a bunch of worthless K cups. Over priced junk!
1,It's going in the trash,"I had a basic Keurig brewer and liked it and the coffee it produced very much. But after less than 2 years, the lever that closes the top and punctures the K Cup broke. Considering what it cost ($100), I was very disappointed that it broke but since it was no longer under warranty there wasn't much I could do about it. I bought a new one, this time the model that (supposedly) dispenses in three cup sizes. It doesn't. The largest size barely yields half a cup. I don't even mean half a cup of coffee -- I mean half a measuring cup. I'm fed up with having to do 3 or 4 or even more brews to get a travel mug of coffee, and at least 2 or 3 brews to get a mug of coffee to drink at home. Emails to Keurig's customer service have gotten me nowhere. As soon as my supply of K Cups is gone, this frustrating piece of junk is going in the trash. I will never buy another Keurig product, I will never give one as a gift, and I will discourage anyone who's even thinking about getting one."
1,Great for a month,"5 days past Amazon's return policy, the pump quit working. We have had one Keurig that lasted close to 2 years. This is the 3rd we've had that died at around the 1 month mark. I love the idea and I wish they worked but the durability is horrible on these."
1,Will never purchase a Keurig again!,"We have purchased three Keurigs in three years. The last one we took back after having less than a month. They have too many problems with the pump. The first two lasted a lot longer than the one we took back. It is not worth spending $150.00 a year for a coffee maker. I guess I will go back to good ol' percolated, which has the absolute best flavor anyway; it just requires a little more patience while you wait ten minutes for it to percolate. Hope this helps."
1,Junk!,"After having 3 of these coffee makers in 2 years each with a ""prime"" error that could not be fixed by me and having replacements shipped,I will now throw this in the garbage and go back to drip coffeemaker. The last keurig was purchased Nov 4,2012 and lasted until Dec 18,2012. Will call customer service but don't expect any action."
2,Keurig does not last,I have had now 2 Keurigs. The first time I thought it was a fluke (croaked at one year mark). Bought another one because I do like the coffee... This one bit the dust too at the one year mark... Totally sad because I don't think I can swallow $100 for a one year coffeemaker....
3,Good Machine While it Works,"This is the second Keurig we've owned. Both lasted about 2 years. Both developed electrical problems. There is a basic design defect with the Keurig system, in that they use very small, plastic water lines that develop lime scale. I de-scaled every six months and used filtered water. When the scale buildup becomes excessive, the electrical pump draws too much amperage and pop goes the GFI electrical breaker. Keurig is aware of the problem and will ALWAYS blame the consumer for not de-scaling often enough - even if you de-scale before the idiot light goes on. Keurig's customer service has gotten so bad that I've decided to try a different company. Good luck if you buy a Keurig."
5,A Great deal on a quality coffee maker !!,"This Keurig B60 coffee maker arrived very fast. It was in excellent condition. It came with a manual and I was able to set it up in a few minutes. Its a great coffee maker and very easy to program ,even without a manual. I am pleased with the auto on /off which makes it very green."
4,"Nice System, Prime Issues","This Keurig is great! When it is working... After about three months of no issues I now get the priming light once every three times I make coffee. Not a big issue, it's just annoying to have to do the toothpick and toothbrush trick when I'm in a rush to get to work. I am on a town water system, so I don't think it is the quality of the water. Other than that one minor issue, I like that you can set the Keurig to turn on at a certain time, adjust the water temperature, and even just run hot water out of it for making bag tea or hot chocolate (let's be honest, k-cup hot cocoa is so watered down it is essentially just brown water, even when you use the smallest cup setting ;) ) The cup size setting is crucial too! So convenient. A great little coffee system when it is functioning at 100%. I would definitely recommend this system to anyone looking to buy their first Keurig."
1,Less then 2 years old and it won't work anymore.,For the last 6 months it's only been making half cups and last week it powers on then shuts off less then 10 seconds later. Only a 1 year warranty. Buying a different brand this time.
1,Junk,"Bull**** Alert from Keurig. This is our 2nd unit in 3 days. We sent the first one back because it was only brewing to 155 degrees and the marketing materials and box and directions and touchscreen all say it will brew to 192.This one only got to 175 (same as our 2-year old one) and after we called customer service -- get this -- the 192 is the ""internal temperature"" (I am not making this up). So, by some miracle of physics the water temperature somehow drops 17 degrees in a fraction of a second after traveling all of 3 inches in a tube from the heating element.Just junk.This one will go back and we will figure out some other way not to waste $140.Don't buy it."
4,Good Product,"I got the B60 for Christmas and so far really enjoy it. The K-cups are easy to find, most grocery stores carry them, Wal-Mart and even a few appliance stores at the mall carry the different flavors. It's quick and I have really enjoyed all the flavors.The only three things I don't like about the machine:1. Cost per cup can be a little more expensive.2. Have to use multiple K-cups to fill my large travel mug.3. If you have a party and want to serve lots of coffee or want to use at work for lots of cups in short time, this isn't the product for you. Though it is quick in making a good cup of coffee it is not designed for mass production."
2,"Expensive coffee, poor quality machine","Purchased this brew machine about a year ago. It worked well for about 2 months, then it started ""Buzzing"" when we turn it on. It sounds like its possibly the pump. Anyway it dis this off and on for a while then stopped buzzing - and kept working well enough for me to keep using it. Then after another few months it started buzzing again. This time it would brew a partial cup, and to get it to stop buzzing I would shake it or tip it to one side and thump it down gently on the counter and it would stop buzzing. We always use filtered bottled water to try and avoid scale build-up. Now today it refuses to work - it buzzes and sounds like its heating water but wont brew - zero / no water will flow at all. I will attempt one more cleaning cycle, then return it to Kohls where we purchased to see if they will replace it with something better."
2,Coffee is not that good,I bought one of these machines and I wish I had just bought an ordinary coffee machine. The K cups are convenient but the coffee doesn't taste that good. I've tried so many kinds. There are a few k cup brands that are OK but overall it's a disappointment. the machine is simple to use and cleanup is easy.The k cups are expensive and the quality is average.I would avoid Keurig machines and just get a nice coffee machine for same price.
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this for my husband last year for Christmas. It worked great for about 6 months and then it started acting up. When we try to start it we have to unplug it and re raise the lid sometimes several times to get it to brew. Tried to make cocoa yesterday with a k cup and it took me 45 minutes and 2 thrown out 1/2 cups of cocoa to get it done. I'm terribly disappointed as this was a pretty expensive ""coffee pot"" to be having these kind of problems.....oh and I did all the cleaning tips, etc....didn't help."
5,The perfect cup!,"I have had this coffee maker for over a year and a half, and it still brewing the perfect cup of coffee for me and the perfect cup of hot cocoa for my husband every morning. My husband loves it because he says that even though he makes his hot cocoa after I make my coffee, there is no coffee flavor on his.It is very easy to clean, I just throw the drip tray in the dish washer, and rinse the k-cup holder with warm water and that's it."
1,Product breaks after 3 weeks of usage,I am on my 3rd Keurig. The first 2 died after 3 weeks of normal usage and now this one has just died. I will never purchase another Keurig product. These used to be made with good quality. It's a shame because it is a nice product until it dies.Clearly the company has reduced the quality to increase their margins and guess what - now they are junk. Fix your product Keurig!!
3,a bit problematic,"It seems that between every cup of coffee (if making more than one) the machine requires priming. Also, one never knows exactly which size up one will get although one of the three choices is pressed.Also purchased Ekobrew cups to make coffee with own coffee. No matter how full I fill it, the coffee is weak."
2,Not to sturdy,"I can't deny it really does make a great cup of coffee when it works, the best.But every single one I've bought (3 in 5 years) I've had to get replaced, Keurig has been very good about replacing them, but come on, every single one.The replacements work about the same so when you start doing the math, don't wince.I'm looking for a replacement brand and would love to hear a recommendation, I still plan to drink k-cups."
3,"It's pretty cool I guess,","but once the novelty wears off you start to notice a few flaws.Namely, most of the coffee pods produce noticably weak coffee. The hot chocolate is pretty underwhelming as well, tasting almost as bland as the ""swiss miss"" brand of instant hot cocoa.Also, the convenience is very nice, but you can't help but feel guilty throwing out dozens of used (and unrecyclable) coffee pods.In the end, it may seem like a really cool idea, but it's really just expensive and wasteful. Plus, it's really not much more convenient than using a normal drip machine. You still have to get a cup, get the coffee, put it in, and WAIT."
2,Mediocre Experience,"I've tried a few different models of Keurig and the B60 is one of better units. It looks good, the water reservoir is a good size and it brews quickly. For regular coffee, it beats Nespresso and Tassimo hands down from a product variety standpoint alone. There are definitely a few weak points though:1) Plastic hot water tank - I just don't like plastic and hot water in the same sentence anymore2) Plastic, non-compostable, non-recyclable k-cups - again, plastic + hot water3) Cost of k-cups - all of the brands that make k-cups are now owned by Green Mountain and like any company with a monopoly, prices going up4) Coffee quality is a sacrifice at bestI just got a new BUNN My Cafe pod brewer that uses compostable pods and would highly recommend it. It has a stainless steel water tank, coffee is hotter and bolder and the construction of this unit is much more solid. Amazingly, it also costs less right now at least.BUNN MC My Cafe Home Pod Brewer"
2,Not good quality,I have had two of these coffee makers and both have failed. The first one lasted maybe three years and the second one lasted one year. They are certainly not worth the expensive purchase price. When I purchased my first Keurig the k-cups were a reasonable price but those have also gone to extremes with their prices. I am back to using a regular coffee maker and the coffee tastes just as good.
2,Unreliable,I've been very dissappointed with this product since the beginning. It constantly has issues priming and working properly. It only works properly about 20% of the time. Otherwise I have to turn it off/on and see if it primes properly to fill the cup. This product seems a little premature for the market - there are definately still some technical issues to be fixed. I would not recommend buying this product.
1,"um, it's about the cost","At $10/lb for pretty good coffee from Sumatra or Central America my french press coffee costs me 25 cents per cup and it is FRESH! And the French Press maker I use is now 20 years old, as is the grinder from Krups.So their ""Nantucket"" blend (and a lot of the others) with this unit is 65 cents a cup. Not counting the maker itself, which has a limited lifespan.I understand that convenience costs money, just want to make sure you do too!"
1,bad choice in long run,"Given a price tag, cost per k-cup (average price $12 for 18 k-cups in Sept 2011), lack of cheap environmental alternatives ($1 reusable cups, returning empty cups to keurig for refiil, puncturing cup mechanism, 1500 watts), Keurig B60 makes a bad choice in long run."
1,Way overrated,"If you're interested in a quick and easy cup of hot brown liquid, look no further. If you truly enjoy a good cup of coffee...keep looking. I tried all the different blends and they were all horrible.Convenience, indeed, does have its price and I'm not prepared to sacrifice flavor for convenience. This one went back to Amazon."
1,It Broke,"I liked this machine-- had it over a year and then it stoped working-- lot of money to just huck in the trash. Also you cant adjust for the size of your coffee mug. A pricey way to make coffee, the K-cups are a tad expensive and if you drink coffee every day you soon realise you can be spending $60 a month on the k-cups."
1,I like my Keurig much better now that I threw it out,"sounding like a Mack truck in my kitchen, pumping constantly and giving only 4 oz of coffee. Descaling monthly. I had 2. Both of them did the same. I'm apparently a little thick to have tried 2 times. It looked really good sitting on top of the electronic garbage at our last electronic pick up date. Best looking piece of garbage on the pile. Really. According to mfg when I complained you need to buy bottled water for it. Who knew????"
4,Keurig B60 coffee maker,"I just started using my new coffee maker. i am used to perked coffee, not drip, and i feel i am pretty particular about flavor of my coffee. i was very happy with the coffee i made using this machine. this model came with a small variety of Kcups so i have tested a few and enjoyed them all, even the hot chocolate turned out great ( smallest cup size ).i gave it 4 stars only because i would have liked to have it discounted more. i think amazon uses the discounts to encourage us to buy the next model up, and i really felt this was as much as i needed.. ( B70 has a greater water capacity.)another fyi that i havent heard anyone comment on; if you register the warranty with keurig you get 2 boxes free when you buy 2 boxes..so for 25 bucks, including shipping i ordered almost 100 Kcups..its a one time thing but worth registering ..."
1,sad,I was very upset.....the Keurig was a Christmas gift. You sent confirmation that I would receive it and then some time later you sent an email stating that the company that was going to send Keurig was no longer participating with Amazon. You should have checked out everything before you led me to believe that I could get a discount on the Keuring. I had to call Amazon and tell your people that something was wrong...I will probably never buy anything from Amazon except books as I have had a Kindle for over a year and am kinda locked into the whole purchase thing.
1,"Wow, how does anyone rate this product a 5?!?","I'm guessing that the people who rate products on amazon are brain dead, hype-believing yuppies who rate based on aescetics, not usability. These things are JUNK. Go ahead, buy one; after about 30-40 uses, it will continually blink ""prime"". This is after two attempts to run vinegar through it to clean the inner workings. Made in China, plastic junk pumps, won't continue to work very long. Worth $100? Nope. But then again, the Pontiac my wife ""had to have"" wasn't worth the money either. Trust me guys, fight the woman on this one and just buy a coffee grinder and a good ole coffee pot."
3,1 k cup = 1/2 cup of coffee !!,"Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing SystemI really like this coffee maker.I am a die hard DD fan and figured this would save me money.It really doesnt because k cups are hard to find in stores and if you do , there is not a lot of variety.1 k cup only puts out a half of a coffee mug and if you press large cup it comes out too weak.prices range from 9.99 a box and up for 18-20 k cups.I have not tried the tea but I think the k cup cocoa is bad.I just use the hot water to make cocoa.It also uses a lot of water.I also think it uses a lot of electricity as my lights flicker when it going.It makes a lot of noise."
2,Disappointing cup of coffee!,"The only reason this coffee maker received two stars is for the convenience factor. If you are considering a single serve system, run don't walk. Run to the Tassimo by Braun. The Tassimo reads a bar code for each type of coffee selected (latte, expresso,capaccino, etc.) and adds the perfect amount of water as well as separately steaming the milk for speciality coffee choices. You enjoy a perfect cup of coffee each time. The Keurig, on the other hand, has a Mickey Mouse system: it only allows you to choose three cups sizes which means you get kind of watery coffee,very watery coffee,or dishwater. Our Keurig is not even worth ""regifting."" We have, however, purchased a second Tassimo for our summer home and have also purchased two others as gifts. Enjoy!"
1,Consistent... consistent garbage!,"Ok, I drank the Kool-Aid or in this case the coffee. Here's the run-down:Machine: Keurig B60 Special EditionCoffees Tried: Paul Newman, Green Mountain, Timothy's and Coffee People all ""Dark Roast""Pros:1. Heat / Start-up is really quick2. Water temp is accurate every timeCons:1. Pods are weak. No matter the cup size you select the coffee taste is flat and weak2. The seperate reuseable filter is just as bad as the pods no matter how much coffee used or how it's packedConclusionI tried all cup sizes with each brand of coffee as well as the reuseable filter and came up with the same results every time, weak and flat in varying degrees. All-in-all I think the fact that the machine makes some of the WORST coffee ever says it all."
3,Keurig B60 SE,Unit works well. I've tried many different K-Cup brands including the refillable My K Cup. I had to resort to using a rubber band to help get a good seal on the top part of the cup. Crappy design flaw but works great with the fix. Found 1 K Cup brand that didn't work and spilled over water and grounds (Tully's Kona Blend Extra Bold). Waiting to be able to buy Starbucks K Cups so I don't have to refill my own with My K Cup.
1,DO NOT BUY this POS,After 2 years the POS gets the dreaded NOT READY message. After hard reset it pumps 1 cup then stops. Save your $s.
1,"Nifty, but not worth $130.","The K cup system is neat, however the reservoir is too small and the price of the system is not justified by the looks or function. The difference between this and the base model is the ability to brew different cup sizes and an electronic auto-on timer as well as different brew temperatures. The K-cups produce over-extracted bitter brews that taste much worse than an entire pot of coffee. A $40 coffee maker easily out performs this unit."
3,"Makes great coffee, machine doesn't last","I admit, this machine makes great coffee. When we have guests, they can all have what they want, strong, mild, decaf, cocoa, whatever (makes horrible tea, BTW). Lots of cup selections in the supermarkets now. The cups are expensive, but we knew that.The problem is with the quality of the machine's engineering and construction. Our first one lasted about a year and a half, which isn't long for something that costs $150.00. The pump started straining and then the electronic display gave out. We liked it so much we bought a replacement, just in case they have improved the quality or if we originally got a bad one, but I won't be buying a third one if this one doesn't last longer.In the newer ""Special Edition"" hey did address a problem with ease of use of the water reservoir. The container now protrudes forward making it easier to remove the container. Still an awkward process, though; I just fill mine with a pitcher."
4,Keurig 60,"Plugged up once after about a month of use - now we rinse clear water through every few cups and it seems to be working well. Great, quick cup of coffee/tea. We really like it."
3,"Great, but doesn't last","Love the coffee, wish the price would go down. Only problem I have had and I have had three going on four as they don't seem to last more than a year if you use it alot like we do. Have had problems with keeping it clean (have hard water) use bottled water and still, our present maker just failed, something wrong with the pump, won't complete the cycle. Have wrote the company and waiting to see what they can do. Really love the coffee and the maker, just wish they would last longer with what you pay for it."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I'll start by saying the Keurig B60 makes a phenomenal cup of coffee. Now for the bad news. After having it for a month and a half the three buttons that determine the amount of coffee that is to be dispensed do not work properly.Sometimes they provide the right amount, and sometimes they don't. I should add that I use only spring water,have cleaned the two ""needles"" that puncture the K-cups and have even cleaned it with vinegar as recommended.For those who are considering buying this product,do a Google search on it and you will see countless numbers of people who have had the problem I am having and ones much worse."
2,Lasted A Year,"Even with regular cleaning (descaling), our keurig is zonking out on us. It's worth the extra money to invest in a newer version, as they have water purifiers built into them. Unless you run distilled water through this one with every use AND white vinegar atleast once every 2 weeks, it won't last long. That is just too much maintainance for an appliance in my opinion.The issues we have been having are that it shuts off after warming up, grows louder and louder but shuts off, and when it DOES finally work, the ""tall"" cup option is about 1/3cup worth. It takes FOREVER for a cut of joe. Other days there are no issues. It's hit or miss but mostly miss."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"Single is a good idea, but we had two of these coffee makers at $250 ea and both stopped working within 12-14 months. Also, we had one of the smaller makers(single cup only) and this stopped working as well. Going back to the old one."
4,Keurig B60,Excellent product. Everyone in the family likes the Keurig and we use it for coffee and hot chocolate. Convenient and easy to use.
1,Worked a few times only. 2 days past return date. Stuck with junk,"It arrived while I was away so it stayed in the box for a few weeks. I'm back and I've been using it for just over a week. It was great for the first few days, now the water won't pump from the tank into the coffee maker. So it's a $150.00 piece of worthless junk that I can't return. This is a terrible product and a bad return policy. I'm glad I kept my cheap, 10 year old Mr coffee maker - at least that one still works."
3,KEURIG-short life!!,"My B60 lasted 20 months before quitting. Should something that costs 160.00 last a bit longer? It was gift from my brother and his wife, so will buy a B40 and hope they don't know the difference. BL"
1,Worst Ever!,"Frustrating!!! I'm 80 yrs. old, so i have had a few coffee makers in my lifetime so far,but this is the most frustrating coffee maker i have ever owned. I will admit the coffee is good,once you get it, but trying to get it is the problem. This machine constantly tells me to ""prime"" the machine.Meaning that it has to have water in it, in order for it to start the brewing sequence. This happens even witha full tank of water.You can't just turn it off and back on again, you have to turn it off, unplug it, plug it back in, turn it onand hope that it works. I have on occasion had to do this several times before it will operate like it'ssupposed to do! I have owned this B60 model for about four months and i'm about ready to throw it in the trash!In my opinion it's not worth the money or the time wasted in ""FRUSTRATION""."
5,Amazing Product,"I received this Keurig machine for Christmas and it has quickly become an appliance that I don't know how I lived without! It is easy to use, offers a great variety of flavors or the option to use your own coffee. It can also make tea and hot chocolate. I cannot compare it to a Tassimo or Senseo, but I LOVE the Keurig. I am tempted to get a smaller unit to place in my cubicle at work!"
5,GREAT Brewing machine,"I love this machine. My husband swears the coffee is great!my kids can have hot choclate or tea plus if i need hot water for cooking, i just hit a button and get the water!it also great for brewing loose leaf tea!"
1,"Great for two weeks, then broke","My wife and I loved our Keurig when we first bought it. Sadly, our adoration only lasted about two weeks. After that it would only work sporadically and would take up to ten minutes to actually produce a cup of coffee. The convenience of the Keurig is awesome, but the quality just isn't there. Don't waste your money."
4,Best coffee machine ever!,"My husband and I got this machine because we were making two separate pots of coffee in the morning due to different start times.This machine works out great because we feel there is no waste. The convenience of the machine is also wonderful. Just pop in the coffee k-cup you want and push the button. No cleanup. Quick.BUT I do have to say I would have given it five stars -- it lost a star because the k-cups are expensive. I am hoping that the price becomes more reasonable. I know you can buy a filter and fill it with your own coffee, but then that takes away from the reason we got the machine in the first place. I buy our k-cups at Bed, Bath, and Beyond because you can use your coupon and get two dollars off each box, and they have a big variety. But if you figure out the cost of the coffee, it's still too expensive."
5,MOMMY OF 2,GOT THIS FOR MY HUSBANDS BDAY! hE LOVE LOVE LOVES THUS! i DONT DRINK COFFEE BUT LOVE THE HOT CHOCOLATE AND TEA! eASY AND FAST!
4,Very Nice - A Little Loud,"We like our Keurig, it is a little loud when brewing.We will check out our friends and see if theirs is loud when brewing, or is something wrong with ours."
3,Not for True Coffee Lovers,"I bought the Keurig a few weeks ago and have tried various blends. After using vinegar to remove a chemical/plastic taste, the coffee tastes okay.If you are a true coffee lover and have 5 extra minutes, I recommend continuing with your a traditional brewer. Here are my primary issues with this type of brewing system:*Coffee doesn't stay warm. Temperature goes to 192 degrees F but I understand that coffee should be brewed at 200 degrees F.*The K cups are not good for the environment. Everyone is in an uproar about global warming, recycling etc. Why isn't there more of an outcry? There are reusable K cups but I understand they don't work as well.*I have tried 5 different Colombian blends but they are not as good as the coffee brewed with a traditional system. The coffee just doesn't taste as authentic.If you just need a small, quick cup, maybe this is for you. Again, the flavor is okay."
1,Waste of money ....,"Thank God I did not pay what they say was full price for this product ($299.00). There is nothing special about this product. I bought it because being a widower now I don't need a full pot of coffee and the idea of gettng one cup seemed perfect for me - no waste. Well if I can get to work that would be a great concept. It is either constantly going into ""prime"" mode or it wont' pull water through and at times the noise it makes sounds like it going to blow up. So I have a bunch of K-cups to use - all Starbucks and I will keep on trying to get it to work once in awhile and when the K-cups are gone the coffee make will be gone also. I have to keep it unplugged and water out of the water well to dry everytime before I can get another cup ... so I am getting maybe 3 cups a week."
2,Lasted about a year,"Worked fine for a year, and then, just like everyone else, stops brewing full cups. Cleaned needles, descaled(has always been used with distilled water) and it dumps water back into the reservoir. Conveniently out of warranty this thing takes a crap. My $30 mr coffee lasted far longer than this thing. What a waste of money. Do NOT pay the high price of convenience. That or buy a different unit"
2,Would not buy again,"I bought this model in June 2012. Have used it 2 or 3 times a day since that time. Previous reviews have voiced my exact sentiments.PROS: It works, coffee is hot and tastes good.CONS: Water not the cleanest; ""Prime"" error enough to think about throwing it away (although disconnecting plug from outlet resolves the error but it shouldn't have to come down to this).As for it labeled as expensive? Come on. If it's too expensive for you then don't buy it.Final thoughts: I still have it and will continue to use it. But I will not buy another Keurig coffee maker again."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have had three of these in the past three years. They dont last. I followed all the cleaning instructions as well as the care of this product. It still broke after a short time. The last three I had, the pumps went."
1,"Great While it worked, now it's so disappointing","It worked great for us for about a year now. My husband uses it once a day & I started using it a few months ago when I found a decaf coffee that I enjoyed. Now it has problems like the ones mentioned in other reviews. It wont make coffee, it gets stuck, it turns off, sometimes it makes a cup & a half of coffee which pours out of our mugs into the lower bowl. We are so disappointed & I really don't know what to do. I'll have to go look for the receipt & see what can be done. Bummer."
1,floweraddict,This product stopped pumping water after about a year. It can't be fixed. It's terrible to have to throw something like this away after such a short time.
1,pump stopped working,Had my B60 for about 4months and the pump seemed to stop working. I search online for a fix and found out this is a common problem for this model. My next move now is to call the company to see if they can send me a replacement.
1,Yet another Keurig that stopped working,"My $15 Black & Decker Coffee pot has worked for 4 years now. Tell me why my $150 Keurig machine has stopped working after less than 12 months. I called customer service and they offered to ""replace"" it for me with the exact same model for $100. Excuse me, but if I'm buying another $100 machine from you, you aren't really replacing anything are you? I'M replacing it at my very own expense. $100 is hardly a discounted price for a machine that will at most last me just under a year. I mean, really? That's what you have to offer me? You're solution is for me to simply buy another one? No thanks. I'll stick to my true blue coffee pot which costs less to buy and costs less to use. Keurig is scam. You are seriously better off never owning one of these machines. I'm a coffee fanatic and if you ask me, it is not a good product, it is a terrible company, and it's simply not worth the money."
2,Big mistake for me. Inside tank can not be drained.,"After lots of reading reviews and getting opinions from friends & family,I purchased the B-60 Special Edition. I have a new kitchen and my Cuisinart Grind & Brew (which brews great coffee) is too tall for the counter. I will start out by saying that I only make coffee a few times a month, so I thought the Single Serve would be convenient. All went well until I realized that there is an inside tank that can not be emptied. Even though you can purge the water if you have not used it for a while, the inside tank will always remain filled. That means the water will sit there and I have significant concerns abour bacteria, mold, and mildew. I called Keurig and they said that the only models that can be drained are the Office Pro or the B-155. There are no home models that have this feature. Unfortunately, I will be returning it. I won't take the chance. Perhaps if you use your single serve frequently, this won't be a problem for you."
2,Coffee maker problems,"Seems like a great idea: coffee is ok. Seems thin, like it needs to brew longer.Also needs to be hotter. When we take our cup of coffee, add cream and sugar, it is simply luke warm.We then microwave it for 20 seconds and it is much better in temperature and flavor.We tried two units. Same thing on both. Needs longer brewing time and higher temperature.I would not recommend."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This coffee maker (Keurig B60 Special Edition) was purchased for my daughter, a college student. Needless to say, it wasn't used every day, but she did take very good care of it and de-scaled it as advised in the product information guide. Wouldn't you know, just a few weeks past the warranty expiration the thing starts spewing hot water all over the kitchen counter. Keurig doesn't make replacement parts for what's causing this problem, but they'll sell us another Keurig coffee maker for a discounted price of $100. How generous of them! If they would just not build the things with crappy parts that break due to high heat, the products would last longer and consumers would be much happier with the product. I definitely would never buy another Keurig."
1,Weak Coffee!!!!!!,"My wife and I are very busy, so we were looking for a quick convenient way to brew a good cup of coffee. This machine is quick and easy, but it is the weakest coffee I have ever had. This machine seems to follow suit with the latest fad of flavored waters. I read all the good reviews posted here and can only figure the people writing these reviews either work for the company, or have never had a good cup of coffee. Don't buy this machine it is a waste of money and time."
4,Doing Research?,"I like most looking here, was doing research and trying to decide between Keurig B-60, the Tassimo, or the Senseo. This was going to be a gift for my brother and he had wanted the Senseo liking the idea of the ""froth"" since he likes cappuccinos better than coffee, but after looking at all the reviews I decided on getting the Keurig. I only gave it 4 stars because I have not personally tried any of them, but talking with my brother he said it makes a good cup of coffee, that it is very fast, looks good and as a bonus it can do tea and hot chocolate. I personally have been looking at getting a KitchenAid KTA-KPES100PM Pro Line Espresso Maker but may get one of these based on what my brother has said."
1,Not worth the counter space. Lousy coffee,"I don't even own one; and wouldn't. I have several friends with them and have never had a decent cup of coffee or cocoa from any of them. Unless there is a secret adjustment that everyone is missing, the results have always seemed dilute and disappointing. Considering the price per cup, I'll take my crappy old Mr. Coffee (which I've unsuccessfully tried to replace twice with more highfalutin coffeemakers) any morning."
3,Avoid if you're concerned about the environment,"This is a really convenient coffee maker, and the coffee is fine. But it's an ecological disaster. The K-Cups are disposable plastic, and you use one for each cup of coffee that you brew. And to get that fast-brewing feature this machine pre-heats the water and keeps it hot, just waiting for the next cup to be brewed, consuming electricity the whole time.It's not so bad if you buy the refillable filter and turn it off after brewing each cup, but then the convenience is gone and you might as well just go for a regular machine with a thermal carafe."
1,junk,xmas present makes half a cup and stops. wasted hours on phone for nothing .thank god it came from costco. that where its going back to. dont wast your mony on this crap.
1,Another wastefull product for lazy people!!!,"We won one and when we realized how pathetic it really is we got rid of it. Not only is it wasteful but it only makes ok coffee. It also, like most coffee makers does not brew at the proper temperature.Its just disgusting how lazy people are these days. Haven't we learned yet? With all of the plastic bottles and other unnecessary waste in the landfills now we are adding BILLIONS of these silly k-cups. As usual the company profitting on everyones laziness does not give a hoot. No recyled, recyclable or biodegradable material. Just more PLASTIC!!!"
1,This Product will Harm your HEALTH!!!,"Dear Sir / Madame -Plastics are know to be carcenogenic. That's not to say you can completely avoid them - it would be a preposterous life. But... waking up everymorning and drinking a cup of coffee from a Keurig is incredibly risky. Effectively, you're piping extremely hot water through a cheap plastic container and then drinking it directly. The carcinogens from that plastic are melting into your coffee and you're drinking it. It's incredibly bad for you!! Make a better choice - for your own good :)All the best!"
1,Don't believe the hype,"Replaced my cuisinart with the b70 model and got nothing but an empty wallet and a cup brown water that resembled a cup of coffee but sure didn't taste like one. We used it for 2 months making coffee, tea, and hot cocoa using the kcups provided with the machine and with others bought in the store.The kcups will have you forking out $60-90/pound of coffee that is sold otherwise for $6-10/pound. You can buy the reusable cups and fill them yourself (which I did) and then you can enjoy a cup of brown water with coffee grounds floating in it. This product is a rip off! Thankfully I kept my cuisinart which I went back to. I would donate the kuerig to goodwill but would not want to subject anyone else to the high price of a lousy cup of coffee. It is going into the garbage instead."
1,There is definitely a fault on this design and I will not recommend or buying another of these units.,I have now purchased two of these units. The second unit was to replace the first when it stopped working after 6 months. The second replacement unit has now broken after 5 months. Please don't wast your money with this machine. The first indicator that something is going wrong is the prolonged pump activity as the machine struggles to fill up the internal water heater tank. The dispensing levels become shorter and shorter as the heater tank inadequately fills. I only use filtered water and carry out the maintenance as instructed within the original operating instructions. I have used the machine daily and only make between 2 to 6 cups of coffee and tea during the day for my family and I.There is defiantly a fault on this design and I will not recommend or buying another of these units.
1,Keurig B60 is not the pot for me,"We received a Keurig B60 for Christmas (2011). At first the machine worked O.K. then we started experiencing pump problems as other people have done also. We called the customer service and they walked us thru cleaning the needles and such in the top part of the machine. The next morning we were served the first cup of coffee with no problem and then the next it was the same old thing. Prime the pump, doesn't work, clean the needle worked one time and them dead again. I am not sold on the whole thing at all. I have tried the variety pack of coffee and have not found one that is any better than may Folgers. I can have coffee for about $13 or 46 oz. in regular pot and $40 for 26 oz. in Keurig. I'm not crazy give me the old fashioned pot. The Keurig is for the ones that think they have to pay alot for something before it is the best. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL."
1,JUNK !!!,"I received an Elite B40 for my birthday in April , 3 wks later it started to mis function ...got that problem taken care of . The following week I dropped the water reservoir & it cracked . I tried to order a replacement but couldn't find it on the order page, i contacted customer service online to question if the B45 was compatible as a replacement . I waited 2 dys for them to get back to me --just to be told that ""I"" had to call & talk to a customer service rep myself .The Keurig makes a good cup of coffee , but not worth the price or the aggravation of having to order & wait for replacement parts.My old coffee pot made a good cup of coffee at a fraction of the price . I am retiring this piece of overpriced junk ....Come on people this is just the latest ""hype"" --so not worth it !!!!!!"
3,Unable to review as I never received it.,My order was never filled as the vendor had a personal emergeny within family I believe. Attemps were made to get it but that never occured. As I was asked to rate the item I could only give it 3 stars. I did own a similar Keurig B60 and liked it. Unfortunatly the pump began to show ware and not function correctly thus the reason for my order.
2,Too Noisy to Use,I was so looking forward to purchasing the B60. I bought my daughter the B40 for her office and she loves it. My model is so noisy that I am shocked that so many people recommend the Keurig. I am so disappointed.
2,Can't get a keurig machine to last over a year,Bought this machine at Costco after the untimely death of the previous addition. Love the bigger tank and I swore the coffee tasted better on this machine. This morning my kcup refused to brew. After unplugging multiple times a strange noise came out of the machine. Turns out the water was refilling back into the tank. Did I mention the machine was two months old? I was able to get a replacement but these machines are on thin ice with my household.
2,Just returned my 3rd pot,"My first pot was returned to the manufacturer after several calls and trouble shooting with customer service. The second pot only lasted a little over 2 years with many issues with having to descale the pot more frequently than recommended, constantly not getting the volume that the cup choice was supposed to give. I just returned the third pot today to Kohls due to leaking. I resorted to using only distilled water in this last pot and did seem to help with the descaling issue. I absolutely love the concept of the Pot but the performance leaves a lot to be desired. I may have to resort to doing what another person has resorted to and buy aPot and return it just before the expiration of the warranty."
2,Doesn't last,"Works well for a while. Variety of k-cups is great. I'm going to try to keep mine limping along until I use my k-cups up, then on to something else. I've had 2 brewers in just over 2 years. That's ridiculous! Especially considering how expensive they are."
3,B60 Heating Element Failed,"I purchased the Keurig B60 a little over a year ago as a gift for my husband (I don't drink coffee). He really enjoyed it and had nothing but praises for the product. Then, last week, he just couldn't get it to work. After calling Keurig, they told him that the heating element was the problem and it could not be fixed and would have to purchase a new one. After much discussion, they offered a new B60 for about $70 (about 1/2 off). He did order the new one and it arrived today. I would take into consideration how much you're going to use it (he only used it in the morning, about 3 cups/daily)., and if you're willing to take the chance of the heating element burning out on you. <><"
3,Leaks after a year and a half,"The coffee maker was great for the first year and a half, then it started leaking. It leaks when the system is under pressure, from the rear of the unit but only after the 3rd cup or so. I thought maybe there was a blockage in the system, but after cleaning it out and running nothing but filtered water through it, it's not a blockage, it's a leak. Now we only use it when we have a special occasion and keep the paper towels handy. For such an expensive item you would have thought a leak impossible especially after such a short time frame of usage. Five stars for the first year and a half, zero stars for the rest of ownership."
2,Also the Water Pump Issue,"I also bought the Keurig Special Edition and for the first two months it worked great! But like so many others who have written reviews the water pumping system on my Keurig has failed. It tries to pump the water from the reservoir into the heating chamber but after 30 seconds or so with no water being drawn up the ""Prime"" light appears. To get a cup of coffee you then have to unplug or remove the water cylinder and replace. Then it works fine....for the one cup....at least for now. For a machine that costs this much it should be better quality. Just another sad commentary on the quality of the Keurig!"
2,expensive one year use,"Looks like this coffee maker should be called the one year wonder....Our Keurig was a gift to us purchased through Amazon. True to the reports of many others, ours lasted 13 months..Only one of us was drinking coffee, with episodic use by visitors. Not a good value, and I would not recommend giving it as a wedding gift ! I liked the convenience, and once I found the coffee I liked, it was great...What I do not like is that with light use, maybe a few times a day for one cup/user each time, it lasted only 13 months...That is $11/month plus the cost of the Kcups. There is a better way to use your money."
2,Broke after six months,"Just like many others have noted, this machine was great while it lasted. I got this around Christmas and about half a year later, it broke. I didn't even use the machine every day so it's not like I put the machine through a lot. One day, I decided to make coffee, hit the brew button and it made a funny noise and nothing came out. The water pump had simply given out. Luckily I was able to return the machine to the store where I bought it. If Keurig is able to improve the reliability of their products, then I would consider buying it again. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this coffee maker."
4,Great machine....,"Overall, I like the Keurig- particularly this model. That said, at the end of the day the actual ""quality"" of the final coffee product is mostly dependent on the K-cups (some brands are quite bad while others pretty good. Thus far I tend to prefer the Green Mountain)."
5,It's a winner!,"The Keurig B60 is perfect for my husband and me. We don't drink coffee every day, and when we do, one cup each is enough for us. We are very happy with our Keurig. Others have mentioned noise from the machine. We don't find it noisy at all. We are enjoying trying the many varieties of coffees and teas available. That's another plus - we can each have whatever coffee flavor we want!"
4,"good brewer, expensive coffee","I bought the B60 for my wife for christmas. We have been using it daily and have really enjoyed the coffee. I happened to buy it at Sam's and it came with 72 various k cups. My wife drinks decaf and the cups are very expensive. I have been doing some research on the reusable cup item offered by keurig but much of the feedback is negative. Seems there is some design issue. Also, someone at a site called www.my-kap.com has come up with some way to reuse the cups. At this point I am still going though the cups which came with the machine so not sure how I will deal with the very high coffee cost associated with the cups."
3,Keurig dead after 2 years,"I purchased a Keurig B50 at Costco for $120 in 2008, now it is 2010 and I am throwing it away. The convenience was great. Once I discovered Emeril's Bold and Intense coffee, the coffee was sufficiently strong. I wish I would have know that mineral build-up will eventually kill the machine! The K-cups were not filling completely and it was not hot enough so I descaled, but it was too late! I should have been using filtered water, de-scaling every 3 months, and not using espresso grind in My K-cup. I turned it off for a weekend away, and when I came back and turned it on it kept tripping the circuit breaker. I called customer service who basically told me it was dead and offered me the B60 for $100 plus tax, and then threw in a 24 pack of coffee when I whined more. I will probably take the offer because I like my coffee instantly with no mess, and now I know how to better care for the machine."
5,One of the best purchases I ever made!,"I LOVE this coffee maker! I was a bit worried when I first decided to give it a try because a few of the reviews said that the coffee is weak when brewed at the large cup setting and I do like a nice, big mug of strong, bold coffee. However, I found this not to be the case. I always make sure to use the extra bold, dark roast k-cups and have never had a problem with weak coffee. I comes out flavorful and never bitter with no clean-up or fuss. It's also great for having company over because I can make ""custom orders."" I have a friend who only likes vanilla coffee, sisters who only drink decaf and cousins who only drink tea and I can accomodate them all with one machine. Great product!"
2,"Expensive, overpriced, but easy to use","The Keurig system is one of the easiest and best Pod systems out there. But it is very expensive per cup as compared to brewing your own with a typical brewer.A box of 20 cups cost $10! A 2 lb bag of gourmet grounded coffee cost $10 but you can make atleast 200 cups with 2 lbs.It is easy to use and gives the lazy minimalist person an instant shot of coffee.If you're a true coffee purist then stay away, the taste of the coffee is not close to a fresh ground.If they can lower the price of a box of 20 to $3, then this system would be a good deal."
1,Keurig Special Edition,Had this for two years. Not worth the money. Never get the size cup I want. It says 3 different size mugs. Even with the largest cup I never got even 3/4 of a small mug.
1,Chinese junk,I bought this item from a vender other than Amazon. worked beautiful for a whole two weeksthen would only pour less than a cup. This was my secound and LAST keurig until its made in USA
1,Terrible coffee maker,This is the worst item I have ever had. If you get more than 1 Year out of it you are lucky. I am on my 4th in 5yrs. I only paid for 1 and 1 was a gift. Same problems on them. Anyone who says this is a good brewer either works for them or has not had thiers over a year and a half yet.
4,Keurig coffee maker was full of water when I received it but it works fine.,The Keurig B60 Special Edition Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System works just fine - It ws purchased used and camewith lots of water inside the box and the unit but works good.Teena Ainslie
1,Great while it lasted,"Worked great for 2 years. Then it starting short filling the cups while returning most of the water to the res. I following all the troubleshooting guides- brewed vinegar, paper clip the nozzle, even tried CLR and nothing helped. Threw it away and looking for something else."
1,Scam,"Ours just died after eight months of light use; two people, about 3 cups a day, total. And, I mean died. When I hit the start button, nothing happens . . . I mean nothing. I even (foolishly) followed Keurig's suggested troubleshooting instructions, trying different outlets, and still nothing. Quite the racket Keurig has going."
4,keurig,I like the system. I got it for my husband. I still like to brew a pot of coffee. He really likes it.
1,Got the dreaded Prime message after two months.,"Don't purchase this product. Google ""Keurig Prime message"". See for yourself how many common this problem is. It's a sort of RRD for Xbox 360 or a blue screen of death for PC except the Keurig does not recover from it. You'll see discussions about this even in Amazon. Mine displayed this msg and does not work anymore a mere two months after I purchased it."
2,Horrible brew temp,"The brew temp barely reached 140 at the spigot. A complete waste of good coffee.I've purchased the updated single cup one (Mini B31) and it brews at 192+. It's not the perfect brew temp, but at least it reaches the what it claims.Seems a lot of people have had to return this one before they got one that produced at a decent temp, but I'm not wasting my time or money.Sending this back with haste."
4,"Keurig Brewing System Good, but expensive way to have a fresh cup of coffee.",I love being able to always have a fresh cup of coffee at my disposal. Never have to reheat the leftovers from my morning coffee.
1,"Excellent coffee, poor brewer quality","We have two of the B60 brewers and one B70 (at work)and all three have failed after about two years of daily use. We always use bottled water in the brewers and make on average two brews per day. They charge a lot for the brewers but their quality is questionable and there is no service path for the brewers, they are considered disposable units.In all three cases, the pumps would not push water through the K-cup. I was able to get the B70 to function again by using compressed air and forcing the air through the plumbing. I never saw a de-scale notice from the brewer. The two B60s are land-fill.Excellent coffee, terrible brewer quality. Any one know of a quality brewer that uses the K-cups?"
3,Dissappointed with this Brewer,"I have owned 3 Keurig's in the past 4 years. I was always a believer. I got 2 family members to buy it as well. Unfortunately, They do tend to have some problems with the water levels, amongst other issues. Keurig did replace my last brewer after owning it for 7 months. The customer service was always very helpful to me. Sometimes the cup is full and sometimes very little water comes out. The one I just recieved was a defective coffee pot. I set it up and everytime I added the water to the tank, it all leaked out the bottom , flooding my kitchen. Not only did I not get to enjoy a cup of coffee, but had a load of laundry to do. I returned this immediately and was credited within 24 hrs. I decided to get the Breville Brewing system. I love it so far. It has a nice look to it and many more features."
4,Love it!,"I love this coffee maker! I have NEVER had a coffee pot in my house before because I had to make coffee at work in the past, and those coffee pots are a pain to use and clean. It was just easier to go to Starbucks. This Keurig is SO easy and simple to use, plus you can remove the metal water drip pad to fit a tall travel mug in the cup area, so you're not limited to little coffee cups. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't set a timer to make it start brewing your coffee automatically. You can set a timer to turn the machine on and start heating the water, but you still have to get up and hit the start button to actually make the coffee. I was hoping to just set a timer and wake up to the smell of coffee, but oh well. Overall I love it and would highly recommend it! I'm really excited to finally have a coffee maker at home!"
1,Total junk,"What a disappointment! This coffee maker failed totally on the first start up and leaked the entire amount of water all over my counter, in the cabinet drawers, onto my wood floor as well as damaged multiple cook books and other written material on the counter. I've never had a product fail so miserably on the initial start up. I would definitely not recommend this item to anyone. Despite it's high price, it's quality is as poor as any product I have ever purchased."
1,Stay away from KEURIG,"Our first Keurig was the CUISINART SS-700, the machine work well for 2 months and then the problem with the water pump started, a lot of humming but no water goes to the unit. We when trough all the cleaning steps. It works for 2-3 coffee and then started again. We dumped the machine and purchase the Keurig special edition B-60. Everything worked ok for two weeks and then the same problem stated with the pump. This time the message would say ""PRIME"" and the blue light in the water tank was blinking, we primed, and after 3-4 cups, the ""PRIME"" message was back. We had to turn of the machine unplug the machine then I was working for another 3-4 cups. We called Customer Service and they took us trough a cleaning step and it was working again for 3-4 cups. We called again Customer Service and after a long discussion and refusing to go through another cleaning step the finally agreed the replace the machine. We received the new machine 2 weeks ago and now we have the same problem"
5,I LOOOOVE This product,"I never bought a coffee maker before now as I didn't need a whole pot of coffee. I live alone. This is so incredibly convenient. It makes a great cup of coffee and FAST!! The k-cups are a no fuss, no mess way of making coffee. I also love that you can make three cups sizes."
5,Fantastic!,"The machine is without a doubt the best. You can't beat the convenience of being able to make a single cup of coffee- any time you want it! And because everyone in my family likes a different kind of coffee, we can all have what we like! The varieties of coffees and teas that are available make this coffee maker worth it in itself. No cleanup. No fuss. Just pop it in and go. And a money-saver, too, since there's no leftover coffee just hanging around. I would never go back to the old-fashioned coffee makers. Never."
1,Dissatisfied,"Received the Special Edition for Christmas 2011. It broke in April, I could not turn it off and on. It was replaced with a reconditioned one which subsequently stopped working on May 31, 2012. I called Keurig again and today I received another special edition pot. Hopefully this one will work. I have a neighbor that had hers for two months and took it back to the store where purchased for a replacement, at least she got a new one. I am not at all happy with this product and their customer service did not offer an upgrade special edition which I,know is available."
4,Keurig,"Love my Keurig -- too bad the K-Cups are so expensive per cup! Since I'm the only coffee drinker in my household, I like the convenience of only making one cup of coffee at a time."
2,Descale Message Won't Go Away,"I've had my Keurig for about 3 years. I loved the ease of making coffee and being able to change flavors. But for the past year all I see is the Descale message. I have tried everything to descale this machine. The message goes away for about a few cups then it's back again. When the message is showing, the machine will go through cycles where it only brews a 1/4 cup. So I have to ""rebrew"" to try to get a full cup. Then it will be stuck on a certain cup size and won't allow a selection. Other times it brews fine. But that message never goes away. From speaking with other owners, this is a common issue with the brewer. I purchased at Bed, Bath & Beyond, but I think it's beyond the timeframe to try to return. Time to start looking for another brewing system."
5,A fresh brew every time!,"I began to get tired of reheating coffee in the microwave that was made hours earlier in the conventional coffee maker, but it seemed wasteful to throw it out, and I thought I would be locked into buying those expensive one-serving sized pre-packaged cups, but once I discovered the reusable filters that you can buy sepatately for the Keurig, I get exactly what I want: my regular coffee made fresh, one cup at a time!"
4,Quick Cofffe,Product does a great job of making coffee quick. No coffee grinds to cleanup. Needs to make bigger cup sizes.
3,"Keurig - ""no"" Cuisinart Keurig brewing system - ""yes""","We have had two Keurig B60 home brewing systems and both have developed problems and shut down within 6 to twelve months. Previously we had a Mr. Coffee ($25,00) full pot brewing system that lasted for over 5 years - still worked when we sent it to the garage sale. For the amount of money one has to pay for this type of coffee making system, you would think it would easily outlast a Mr. Coffee. All this being said, we still prefer the individual brewing system over the full pot system, so our latest purchase is a Cuisinart (keurig brewing system). We have several friends who have this model and so far have had no problems. I can say, if this one fails as quickly as the first two, we probably will not be purchasing another until the KEURIG mechanism is better perfected."
2,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!,This unit worked fine for a month then started making irregular cup sizes of coffee and would shut off when it wasn't suppose to. Attempted to contact Keurig for help. They were too busy to take my call and had to leave call back information. They returned my call three days later outside of the time frame and left a message that if you are still having trouble to call back in and yes again they were too busy to take my call. This went on for a week and a half til I just returned the unit. I am now looking at Cuisinart's K-Cup coffee maker.
4,"Not THE best cup of coffee I've ever had, but...","I got one of these for Christmas and I must say I like it a lot, but it isn't the *best* cup of coffee I've ever had as it is advertised. It is fast though. And convenient. And there's no mess. And it's very cool, and did I mention FAST? I timed mine at 90 seconds from off to ready and then like 38 seconds for a cup of coffee which is faster than I could boil water on my stove. I didn't think it was noisy and it's acutally quieter than my old Krups. I would say overall I'm pretty satisfied and I like being able to choose my coffee by the cup. Oh, using bottle water easily improves the taste of your cup and (I hope) will give me longer times between descaling. I'll be buying a box of Coffee People k-cups next month to try them out. BTW, Sam's Club has 80-pack boxes of k-cups for about $33 each if you're looking to save a bit per cup. Now all I need is a machine that I can put vodka and gin in that makes me any martini I want."
3,Hit or miss?,"Length:: 1:15 MinsHopefully, you can wake up 5 minutes early to brew a cup. Sometimes, it's your lucky day, and the Keurig B-60 lets you know by brewing a cup of coffee for you on your first shot. Other times, you know it's going to be a bad day, because you're wasting time playing with the coffee machine while you should be getting dressed.My experiment: I brewed 6 cups of tea to try to catch it ""acting up"", but I think it knew I was filming, so it was on it's best behavior. Anyway, I didn't want to waste the footage. Someone may benefit from it.Purchased October 2009. Started acting up around October 2010. I'm not even sure how to describe what happens, but I know if I open and close the lid repeatedly, eventually something kicks in.The video shown is a double shot at the smallest cup setting using the Bigelow Organic Rooibos with Asian Pear Tea K-cup.Peace"
1,So Disappointing...,"This is a great looking machine, but the quality does not match up to appearance. After about 3 weeks of ownership, water stopped being pulled from the reservoir correctly. You have to pick up the reservoir and push it back down to get water to pump (this is with a full amount of water), otherwise the machine tries to pump the water until it shuts itself off. After some digging, this appears to be a fairly common problem."
2,B60 dead at 15 months,As posted by others after about 14 months old my B60 began to not brew the proper amount of coffee and occasionally will not brew anything. This is happening more and more frequently. I don't expect it to last much longer.
2,Disappointed,"This fancy-pants coffee maker was a big disappointment. I bought this for my husband for his birthday - looking for a great pod coffee system. This coffee maker isn't it.He was excited to unwrap his gift - seeing as how we spotted this machine in Bloomingdales. We loved the appearance...but the love stopped there.Sure, it's fast & easy to set-up, BUT...the coffee quality is poor, no better than instant coffee. And on the ""travel mug"" setting, it only fills the mug about 2/3 full. We tried to brew the same K-cup twice to get it to fill the mug, but that only made the coffee taste like hot water. Our plain Mr. Coffee coffee maker brews better tasting coffee, and fills our mug - no matter what the size. I guess if it means cleaning out the filter everyday, it's worth it for better tasting coffee.Save your money."
3,Awesome Coffee Brewer Until the Pump Failed,"The B60 makes wonderful cups of coffee in multiple sizes. While I agree with the many rave reviews of this machine, Keurig needs to pay attention to the all too common failure of the pump system. Mine failed after about 5 months....the only negative but very disappointing fact."
3,Great Coffe but machine acts up after repeated use.,"I purchased this machine about 6 months ago, and it has gotten daily use since that time.Recently, in the past month or so it has started to ""act up"". The water does not warm up, or it only brews a half of a cup. Sometimes when you push the button, nothing at all happens.So, what used to be a quick 30 second cup of coffee haas now become a daily ritual of waiting, praying and cursing. I would think that for the price of this coffee maker it would last a littler longer than 6 months without having difficulties. Oh, and by the way, we are conviently well out of the 30 day money back guarntee."
1,Replacement #2,"Ordered this as a Christmas gift and we loved it until it stopped working after using about a dozen times. Same problems as many other reviewers - the system would hum, may or may not pull water over to heat it and then would either read ""Not Ready"" or would simply shut off. Called Keurig customer service. They took me through a few cleaning steps with my machine and when it still didn't work they sent me a new machine. Received the replacement (a step up in models as my first was the B60 and they replaced it with the Platinum B70) and after 2 weeks it had the same issues. Called Keurig again and they are sending a new replacement that is from a ""new shipment that has been tested for the issues that some machines were having."" I hope that is true as I loved the machine when it actually worked!"
3,It's great....when it works.,"I have owned my coffee maker since November of 2011. At first it worked great and made a good, fast and convenient cup of coffee. I switched because I was always throwing out coffee from my drip coffee maker. However, after about four months it started acting up. I actually had to unplug and re plug it like rebooting a computer. I never knew when it would happen but the frequency became greater and greater. Now it started a new trick, it makes a loud growling or gurgling sound and only works every other time or so. Getting help from Kuerig has been difficult."
5,Better model than before,"Had a B60 for about 3 years, finally died.Bought another, has larger water reservoir, much quieter.3 more stupid words for review to post."
3,"If you get error of ""Prime"", please request for exchange","I bought one from Kohl's using the 30% off coupon in July.I began to have the problem of ""prime"" from the second or third day. I use it very lightly, about 1 or 2 cups per day. So I contacted the customer service and the guy instructed me to send back the cup holder as evidence of purchase. A new machine was shipped at no cost. The new machine has been working well. I only have had 2 ""Prime"" so far and very easily fixed by adding more water. The reason for the ""Prime"" might be the low level of water in the tank. Keeping the water above certain level may prevent the problem to happen. If you search the website, you can find some tricks for ""prime"".Though prime is a problem for the machine, if you have the problem at a daily base, something must be wrong with the machine and you need to contact the customer service to get a new one.By the way, I also bought a My Kcup and it works well with my own ground coffee."
1,Great while it lasted,"The coffee maker was great while it lasted. My wife and I do not get up at the same time, and have different tastes in coffee, so it was very convenient. We were very happy with the coffee maker.However, after about 18 months, the pump started failing, and now when the brew button is pressed, it only brews a cup about half the time. And when it does brew, it rarely brews a full cup. We've tried cleaning it many times, and this is clearly a mechanical failure.I would have given it 4-5 stars earlier, but I cannot give a positive review for such an expensive coffee maker which fails after 18 months."
3,Give me a break...,"I think this book is about freely giving of oneself because it not only makes the other person feel good, but it makes the giver feel good as well. Sharing is the name of the game here, not buying friends, not destroying our bodies for the sake of others. We teach our children to share--why? Because we want them to coax others to be thier friends? No, because that's how we care about one another. Fortunately, the outcome of such selflessness is typically friendship. It's all about how you see life and if you view it negatively, all you're going to see is the muck."
3,"beautiful pictures, terrible story...","My 1 1/2 year old LOVES ""fishies"" so this book seemed ideal for her. Well, As I started reading it to her I was very disturbed by the message. The rainbow fish gives away his scales to make friends...How horrible!!! Everytime I read the book, I change the word ""give"" to ""borrow"" which could have easily been done by the author. This book is NOT about sharing. Sharing, to me, means letting someone borrow something for a given amount of time, AND GETTING IT BACK! Children shouldn't be taught that they have to give their things away to make friends, especially, pieces of their body! How bizarre?! My daughter loves this book and I cringe everytime she brings it to me. Like I said, the pictures are absolutely beautiful but the message is terrrible, I really can't believe this book is on bookshelves!"
1,How to buy friends,"This bath book is a very abridged version. The story is basically boiled down to a message that if you want friends you have to give them your stuff. The rainbow fish has a lot of glittery scales that make him beautiful. Another fish swims up to him and asks him for one of his scales. Rainbow fish refuses and the fish swims away. Rainbow fish is lonely and asks an octupus why he has no friends. The octupus suggests that he give away his scales. After rainbow fish does that he has lots of friends.I think this book has a terrible message. It is about how to buy friends, not sharing."
2,"If you don't share your body, friends will swim away?","This book is great for the water and has beautiful art, but it has a disturbing message. The deeper meaning that I want to keep away from my child's subconscious is that he must give away body parts to make friends. Even if one takes the shiny scales as a metaphor for money or toys, any friend that stays for what he gets is an opportunist in my opinion. I will teach my child to share and to make sacrifices for his friends when they are in need but not with this book. When my child learns to read, I will remove this book from the bookshelf."
4,wrong message interpreted,"unfortunately, the book is a condensed version of the original story so it does indeed send out a ""bad"" message. The movie goes into much greater detail, showing that rainbow fish is very conceited and quite selfish and he doesn't listen, share or want to play with the other fish unless it is on his terms, so to speak. my opinion is that this book IS about sharing and learning to take the time to care about someone else's feelings."
1,Don't give in to your curiousity.,"I love the band Further - which is the band that Darren and Brent Rademaker formed after Shadowland. So I ordered a used copy of this cd because I was curious about what they had done previously. It's hard for me to write a description of what this sounds like, but I will say this - this cd - at times - sounds like a slightly edgier Nelson. So, not good. Just trying to help you curious Further fans. Don't do it."
3,Expensive misleading reprint,"As far as I can tell, not having purchased the item, this is a reprint of Osgood, S.W. 1910. ""Zinc Mining in Tennessee""; Tenn. Geol. Surv., Bull 2, which can be downloaded for free. Just Google the title. The reprint may be 24 pages including the title pages etc. but the original contains only 17 numbered pages or $1 per page."
5,Our place in space,"I first read ""The Council of Seven Lights"" in 1974, and have looked for the last 26 years for a copy of the book to read once again. This little book has more informational material on the subject of our relationship to space and God than any of the works written on this subject since it was first released in the 1950's. In a simple and complete manner the most complex aspects of the inner workings of creation and the inter relationship between races of space beings is clearly explained. A must read for serious seekers of knowledge in this area of study."
4,Memphis Gathering STAR OF THE NIGHT BOOKER LITTLE,"Grab this just because there is Booker Little, I know it's pricy, but if you still dig records you might find a japanese reissue for much less. Back to the review Booker is featured on just two tracks, this was cut while he was with Max Roach. The blusy tunes just emphasize all over this record on the first two tracks, but the last two emphasize a bebop feel with some great work on the air instruments. A+++ just wih there were more from this bunch"
3,"Good Company, Bad Shoe","The leather in these shoes is not soft. It's hard. The left shoe felt perfect, but with the right shoe, when I step, the leather pushes inward hard against the joint under my big toe. The result has been enough pain to cause me to limp. And the pain still hasn't gone away after a week of not wearing the shoes.The company is very good. The customer service is top notch. The styling of the shoes is sophisticated. But the leather is hard, and the shoes hurt. I'd recommend great caution, if you're purchasing these shoes--or possibly any Bostonians. I think there's something wrong with the construction, so that they simply don't fit right."
3,Soft and good,Shoes are soft and comfortable. I needed to add a lift in the heel for the side of the shoe hit my ankle bone in the wrong place. Haven't worn them but once to discover that the sides were 3/8 to high for my ankle bone.
5,great shoes!,"my husband purchased a pair of these shoes a few years ago, and wears them almost every day to work. earlier this year he was moping around the house wishing he had bought 2 or 3 pairs. we hopped on line, and amazon to the rescue! great shoes, great price, great look too!"
2,Awful,Some stories are just awful and some too speculative.Some deviates too much from the original Cannon characterization.Overall too shallow and not a very thought provoking views on some Cannon characters. Instead I recommend people to read the original Sherlock Holmes.
2,Last Place in Holmes' Collections,"Having read quite a few collections of new Holmes mysteries, this was the least enjoyable. Although the stories are not without merit, they are written from the perspective of secondary characters in the original works. In reading the book, I seem to have very little interest in their perspectives and this seems to be an academic exercise to cobble a book together and publish it. Buyer Beware!"
5,Back in Time . . .,"I downloaded this book to see how the Kindle app worked on my iTouch. Didn't expect much for a free book. First of all, I'm thrilled with the Kindle app and how it has worked, but found myself totally engrossed in this delightful read. As one reviewer has commented, I too, loved the ""no sex, no violence, no swearing"" (or something like that) aspect of this book. It is informative to read the customs of those days and period pieces typically help me remember how very far our technology has progressed in such a short time.I would gladly read more writings by this author."
2,Not worth reading.,I have to admit that I'm surprised by the other reviews. I only made it halfway through this book. There is very little action and the facts of the case are repeated over and over and over. I expected a lot more and am glad that this was a free book that I can easily delete from my Kindle.
1,Do NOT order this belt for RSX type-S,"I ordered this part using the search options on Amazon's auto site, but it turned out to be the wrong belt! I verified the correct belt with the manufacturer, re-ordered the correct belt, and had to return this one. Be sure to find the correct auto part before looking on Amazon!!!"
2,It's okay.,"The ring is nice, but a little lighter than expected. Sadly, the tension-set stop popped out after a week. But shipping was fast and no problems with the seller. Product just not up to par."
3,Not as sturdy as their old units,"We had purchased a similar product from this same company fifteen years ago. The old product was well constructed of thick metal, etc. Unfortunately when you Googled in that part number, it came up blank, making me think that this unit is no longer available.We bought this unit as it seemed to be of similar make and quality by the same manufacturer. The unit looks good but it is not made of the same sturdy metal of their old units. We do construction work and if this thing were ever run over by a truck, it would likely shatter. Their older units would likely survive being run over on a grass/dirt area.The company did deliver what it described so there was no misrepresentation. I think I am just disappointed because I know what they used to make and the old stuff was so much better."
3,"For what it is, it is what it is ....","Really. I mean that. It is a metal box designed to withstand the stresses of the general contractor. Ya the edges may need ""de-burring"" and such, but geez - you're most likely a contractor who handles modifications to tools and products all the time. Take your file and the 10 seconds of your life to de-burr the edge. Done. I would rather that then pay 40 to 50 dollars extra for the same metal box de-burred for me.I have had mine for 4 years and it has done what I asked it to do and for the money have expected nothing more. I didn't even need to de-burr it. It holds the necessary paperwork you need it to. It has a strong clip on top to secure some weighty items if needed. At the end of the day, week, month or whenever I clean it up a bit - straighten out the papers and re-load it ready for more work."
2,About as sturdy as a cardboard box,"I do not like to give to bad reviews. But, this really is a piece of junk. Most cookie tins are better constructed then this product. All the edges of the sheet metal are unfinished and sharp. The aluminum is very thin gauge and will bend with the slightest stress. This product will not live through more then a few months of normal job site bumps and bruises."
4,Aluminum Storage Clipboard from Saunders,"I ordered 4 of these for my technicians who work on the road in industrial environments. They are just the right size: they hold our reports, pens, self-inking stamps and other accessories. They keep our reports clean and organized. The boss took me aside and thanked me for finding them and getting them for the company. Thanks"
4,Clipboard,Very good price! Less than half the price of the exact same item from Grainger!! They don't even compare to the ones I replaced quality wise though. Much lighter and made a little on the cheap side. All in all worth the money.
5,Fantastic and concise,"Unless you are a world chess champion (or Doctor of Chess Science), you will find this book intriguing, helpful and ""an edge"". Will assist most beginner to above average players, especially those interested in classic moves. Grab a copy and carry it around with you."
4,Lotus Esprit By Jeremy Walton,"For anyone whether an owner, enthusiast or prospective owner of an Esprit, this is a book well worth purchasing and reading. Full of history, detailed information, pros and cons of ownership, details of the models so far (except very recent), performance, statistics, great photos and so much more. Well worth the money if the Lotus you want, or want to know about, is the Esprit."
1,Poor,This book is not a book I would purchase. The content is not anywhere near the books I have purchased from other authors.
3,Ferry's Mixed Bag,"For me, Bryan Ferry's second solo album is a bit uneven in the quality of song choices. I find most of these selections rather boring, even with Ferry's unique arrangements and vocal stylings present. But though half of the CD is a little uninspired, there are five songs that make this worth purchasing. The best songs are the first and last ones. ""The In Crowd"" is handled perfectly with just the right amount of camp and humor. Also a bit humorous are the versions of ""Walk A Mile In My Shoes"" and ""Fingerpoppin'"". ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" is touching and lovely. Finally, the title track is one of Bryan's best original songs with its unusual time changes and catchy melody. If you dig this CD, pick up his first solo outing, ""These Foolish Things""."
2,Two great tracks: two stars,"This album would have made a classic two-sided single, with his absolutely sick and brilliant version of ""The 'In' Crowd"" (dig those power chords and freakout guitar solo) backed with the original ""Another Time, Another Place,"" which sounds like an outtake from ""Stranded"" or ""Country Life."" The rest of the album is at best OK--depends on how much you like the songs he's covering. It's pretty much a must-buy album for those two songs alone...try to find a used copy."
3,some killer songs; some killer remakes,"This album is an excellent attempt to take oldtime classics and turn them into actual rock songs, and then add a few good originals. The remakes are fantastic, especially ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"", ""Walk a Mile in My Shoes"", ""Funny how time slips Away"", and ""Fingerpoppin"". You will have all your limbs shakin and boppin and funkin at these remakes. The final tune has a great core rythym, and it's too bad Ferry couldn't have found a way to make it longer and more soulful."
2,Uninspired follow-up to a masterpiece,"Ever go on a vacation to somewhere new, and you don't know what to expect, and you just have the most fun, and enjoy yourself immensely, and you can't wait to go back? Well, that's what Ferry's 1st solo album, THESE FOOLISH THINGS is like. And then you go back to that same vacation spot, and the magic is gone, and it's not the same the 2nd time around, and it's not nearly as much fun as the 1st time you went. That's what this album, the follow-up, Ferry's second solo LP, is like. Thematically, ANOTHER TIME... is the same a THESE FOOLISH THINGS, but for whatever reason; song selection, inspired performances (or lack thereof) or execution, it's not nearly as fun, or as good, as its masterwork predecessor. Sometimes, you can't go back."
5,Gates serpentine belt,"Got the product fast.Great price,and the correct part.No problems. Great product from Gates. Also allot cheaper than the auto parts stores."
3,Rosewood jewelry box,"Rapid receipt. Well packaged to prevent damage in transit. Disappointed that back of jewelry chest is plywood. Description on Amazon.com was misleading, claiming chest made entirely of rosewood. Therefore, item is overpriced."
2,Who's Last...well sort of,"More of a curiosity for hardcore fans than an enjoyable concert film, this tape is married with lacklustre performances and a terribly muddy sound mix. The sound on this ""Stereo"" VHS is even worse in the DVD age, however in light of other concert videos from the time such as the Talking Heads film Stop Making Sense (released just two years after), I think this tape would of sounded mediocre even back in 1982. A few laughs as Daltrey gets his microphone cord tangled up in Townshend's guitar lead after one of his patented mic twirls. Also the dated 80's video effects are also good a laugh.Maybe a remixed DVD would bring the star rating up."
5,The third wave women's movement's key issues,"Leslie L. Heywood's THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT TODAY: AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THIRD-WAVE FEMINISM provides a strong 2-volume reference charting the third wave women's movement's key issues, members, writings and more. While the U.S. movement is the primary focus, additional mention is given to the movement in other parts of the world, while over 70 contributors provide a range of activist and academic voices discussing third wave issues."
1,Neo-revisionism,"Ben-Yehuda builds a weak case of Neo-revisionism. Rather than investigate the true archaeological record, the author relies on the skewed and biased reporting of liberal reporters...especially those of Ha'Aretz. If you want to really learn more, read the work of Prof. Amnon Ben-Tor, ""Back To Masada."" Here, Ben-Tor masterfully undermines the argument that Masada is only a myth."
3,ETL it's better,"GOOD CONCERTS, BUT ALL THE SONGS ARE FADED IN THE END AND SOME OF THEM IN THE BEGINNING, THIS IS VERY ANNOYING BECAUSE ""IT'S LIVE"". BOTH CD'S VERY EDITED."
1,rip-off,why does amazon sell this?this is an unauthorized recording.the band is not being paid.don't buy it.
2,All good to thoose who wait.,"That's not true in this particular moment.I hope this is the last time i ever here these classical BÖC-songs in some sort of live best of...da da da.This is my most favorite band, and now i hope they hunting high & low for a good producer.Meanwhile i hold on to Buck Dharmas Red & The Black albums....."
5,"Made as expected. Quality metal product, well made housing",Arrived when promised. Price and quality exellent. Very easy to install. Expected nothing less. Better price than at home depot which was out of stock anyway.
4,The industy standard for generato inlets,I'll preface this by saying I am a licensed electrician and have installed close to 50 of these boxes over the past couple years. These boxes are nema 3r and are of good quality I have yet to have any of them fail. This inlet fits the 30amp 220/11v twist lock cord commonly found at the Home Depot. Couple this unit with a transfer switch and you have a very safe and reliable way of feeding your home with a generator. This is the exact same unit most electrical supply houses sell.My only complaint of this box is you can't feed it with conduit from the top as the way the cover comes off both the front and top come off as one piece. You HAVE to do your wire entries either from the side or bottom. This is not a deal killer but the installs look much better with the outlet below the panels rather than off to the side.
3,Wrong Picture - BEWARE,"The picture is actually of a L14-20 connector box (with the locking lug pointing away from the center of the lug circle). The L14-30 standard actually has the locking lug point toward the center.If you try to match the lug patterns to your cable - this box won't work with the 20 amp generator cables. In fact, if you blow up the picture, you can see that the picture is actually of a 20amp rated inlet box."
3,mounting the box,"i dont know how they expect you to tighen the top screw inside the box and still get the cover on.the only way would be to nut and bolt it and tighen it after installing the cover,only if you could get acess from the backside?"
1,DISSATISFACTION WITH ACE,THIS ITEM WAS ORDERED AND A WEEK PASSED WHEN ACE NOTIFIED ME THAT THIS ITEM IS OUT OF STOCK. THIS ITEM WAS IN STOCK WHEN I BOUGHT IT. THE AMAZON SITE STILL SAYS IT IS IN STOCK. THERE WAS A THREE DAY DELAY IN EVEN GETTING A RESPONSE FROM ACE. I'VE REQUESTED A CANCELLATION FOR THIS ITEM. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY.
1,item never arived,"ordered almost month ago.no e-mail, no box,no money back(yet)very bad costumer service nobody should trust them with the own money"
5,PB30 POWER INLET BOX,"Good quality, easy to install. A must have when installing a transfer switch for a generator. I would definetly purchase this product again."
2,Good if you're a Gorilla,The knockout I used on this box was barely scored. The metal dented and twisted before giving way. Very tough compared to a Square D box.The clamps to hold the wiring onto the plug barely grip the wire making assembly of the box a challenge.And finally the clever design of the box cover makes it impossible to screw the box fully down to a flat surface and still put it together so it hangs loose.
5,My son loved it for years!,"My son got this as a gift from his Aunt when he was 4 or 5 years old. He loved it and played with it long after the art supplies were used up. He used it to carry lots of things whenever we were leaving the house to go somewhere. I think he liked that he could see through it to get what he wanted easily. I thought it might tear one day, but never did. It lasted until he outgrew it."
3,great back pack,"The back pack is a great buy, the stamp markers are the most exciting thing in the bag. My advice is purchase for the back pack and then fill it up with extra art goodies for the kids."
3,backpack art,"I thought it was a nice product as it is, but the content and backpack were small and not worthy of the large price. the drawing pad was too small and would last such a short time.If you have lots of money to spend and don't mind having very little for your dollars this would work well, but if you are budget conscious then don't spend the money as you are not getting enough value for your dollar.The backpack was nice as a storage case for art supplies but the content was too few for the price.I would have liked to know the size and the included contents in the write up of the product to make a better decision."
4,Better priced than the stores,"Overall I liked it. It did seem a bit anemic in terms of contents, but still a good value for the money. Would like to see a slightly more expensive version with more in it."
3,"Nice idea, but there are a few drawbacks.","I love the idea of no-mess markers. Especially with my daughter and her love of drawing on all surfaces available. However there a couple of drawbacks to this product. The coloring book limits you to drawing only the items in the book, and only on certain areas of the page treated to respond to the markers. This tends to inhibit the ""free spirit"" of a young childs drawing development, although you can argue it makes them draw within the lines. The other issue is the seeming total lack of being able to order(at least online) more coloring books or drawing paper that will work with these markers without buying a whole new kit. I don't know about the rest of you, but my daughter went through that book in about two days. Now I have a bunch of markers and nothing left to use them on."
3,Use with Caution,"The markers have a strong chemical smell that gives me a headache after about 20 minutes. Therefore, I limit the amount of time my daughter can use them. Also, the papers yellow over time and the colors fade. This is fine as long as you don't plan to keep the art as keepsakes. Otherwise, my daughter (age 5) loves to use both the notebook with pictures to color and the blank refill pages you can buy separately."
2,Stained clothing,I loved the concept of the markers. However they have left a greasy stain on my daughters clothing!! The package said that they didn't stain! I called and they gave me a long process to try and remove including Tide with Bleach..Is that one of their subsidiaries? I was very disappointed.
2,Not so Wonderful,"I bought this for my son, who is two years old, it sounded great. It could only color on it's own ""Color Wonder"" paper until you turn your back and the pen's have put there wonderful color onto your custom cabinets. The pens left there mark like a perminante marker, my husband had to use paint thinner to remove the stains. Well it sounded good at the time but some things that sound too good to be true, probably are (as in this case)."
5,Crayola Color Wonder,This product is a wonderful product. You can leave a child unattended and not have to worry about markers getting on furniture. It is also great for the car.
4,Dangerous Writing,"Really this novel should be called ""Why We Are in Vietnam"", because after reading this work, the answer to Mailer's original question is plain to see. His best work, and for once not overly-long! A good book to show you just how powerful good writing can be."
4,"Fun, but difficult","This game is very fun - it is a lot like Trivial Pursuit - but many of the questions are for die-hard fans only! The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is due to the fact that the game is nearly unplayable for someone who has not seen every episode and remembers crazy details. If you think you know a lot about South Park, this game will definitely be a good gauge!"
5,A refreshing soaulful sound for country music,Jamie Warren's debut album Fallen Angel is something he obviously put his heart into. It is packed with 12 perfect songs that he either wrote or co-wrote and he sings them with the emotion that they deserve in his sweet baritone voice. How good is he? Three times in the past year I've traveled 800 miles to Canada just to hear him sing. If you want to hear something other than the cookie cutter cowboy on the radio today buy this CD NOW!
3,Reconsider if you want to be mobile with your case,"The shoulder strap and the handle both failed within the first 2 weeks of use while being only half full. I like the inside layout and the case itself, I had hoped for better quality on the mobility options of this product. If the handle and strap held up, I would give it a 5 out of 5."
4,Favoured Statistics Text by Public Health Masters Students,"I only have the 4th edition of this book. I showed it, along with several others, to MPH students and asked them to select the book they would most like to use for their studies and as a reference. This book was the unanimous selection, I suspect because of its clarity and accessibility, even though it is not specifically written for public health practitioners. The only drawback for those of us in the developing world is the price, which puts it out of range for many of our students."
4,"Good, could be better.","It has a lot of different printing modes. I haven't even tried out anything other than the standard printing and flag printing (for wrapping around cables). Like other reviewers, I wish it had a QWERTY keyboard rather than alphabetical. I also wish it had a 'shift' function for a single capital letter rather than having to set caps lock which requires holding the function button while pressing another button, then typing the first letter, then removing caps lock the same way. Other than that, it's fairly simple and intuitive for printing out basic labels which is the main reason I bought it in the first place."
3,Good product,This label printer has been great. I have used mine for over a year now.I have one regret. I wish I had paid attention to the picture and that the letters and numbers were in alphabetic order and not in any qwerty arrangement.
4,"Wonderful, just wish that it was Longer",This book was wonderful. It even had helpful lessons in it. I just wish that it was longer.
3,Short on details,"This is a good introduction book for those who know nothing about Hajj. It lists the basic steps involved in a Hajj step-by-step, however, it does not go into explanation or detail of the steps. For example, the step ""Going to Makkah"" has four bullet points under it. There is no explanation of where to stay in Makkah, no list of accomodations, no introduction to Makkah, no information about tour groups or others who may arrange for Hajj trips.Other steps are similarly lacking in detail. Like three types of Hajj are listed but there is no mention as to which Hajj will fit what type of curcumstances. The author suggests to enter the al-masjid Al-Haraam from as-Salam gate, however, the sketch of the masjid Al-Haraam on the next page lists all the other gates except the As-Salam gate!!!I was quite disappointed with lack of details in this book. I will have to look for another book for details."
2,Not what I expected,"The plot of the was good. The actors were not bad either, but I can honestly say if I were able to preview this movie I would not have bought it."
2,In the desert you can't remember your name 'cos there ain't noone for to give you no fame,"What sounds interesting from reading the cover turns out to be a lot less interesting on the screen.Clearly low budget, one is reminded of the Mummy from the outset. The story is quite intriguing but not matched by the acting or the effects.Worth a watch but better on the small screen where it belongs."
1,Run Far Away From This Stinker,"Sheesh, this was awful. Where do I begin? Horrible script, bad dialog, a ""300"" ripoff for the first 20 minutes,and special effects that make you laugh they are so bad. There is a scene early in the film in which an elaborate Egyptian city is being torn down, and it looks like a special effect from a 1930's monster movie.Avoid this at all costs."
2,"Like sands through the hourglass, so are the Days of Our Lives.","In 1923 Cecil B. DeMille filmed ""The Ten Commandments"" at Nipomo Dunes in California. There he buried the film set after making the picture.This film has a Hallmark feel to it and does not take too much time to make CGI look real.With all the negatives it is still fun to pass the time with if you like all the sci-fi quickie movies where evil pops up mostly in desert scenes."
4,A Bit B-grade but fun,"Thought it was okay for a B-grader liked it worth the price, the idea was great and had so good bit's but could have been much more with a better scrip"
3,GOOD STORY PLOT,"I am not a harsh person in regards to others work when it comes to making a movie. I see a lot of BOZO'S who like giving movies a one star rating or quotes like ""IF THEY HAD A FIVE NO STAR RATING I WOULD."" People like this to me are despots, angry people who have anger and self-esteem problems and enjoy tearing down other people and the work they have created. For me to give a movie a one star rating, it would have to been made by Five people in their back yard, or a complete rip-off from another movie hit with the same story line and script. Hey people, look at all the credits at the end of movies, and see what it actually takes to put a movie together. How many of you ONE STAR DESPOTS have produced YOUR OWN MOVIE? Until you have, don't be so critical of others."
1,So bad it's good?,"Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin, yay! Um... wait.... that CGI is really terrible. Whoa, Egyptian curse! But the CGI is just TERRIBLE. And the sets are awful. And it's all low-budget, but well-lit. That's a bad, bad combo. Deliberately bad? I mean, honestly, this is soooo awful, why on earth would anyone make it this way unless it was on *purpose*?This movie is frankly terrible beyond words. On the other hand, it's chock full of cliches and Hollywood mythology and looks like it was excellent fun to make. This might be the sort of bad little gem that actors put on at parties to laugh over; it looks like something deliberately done for schlock effect.I kind of like it. I know! It sucks. But... I still sort of like it anyways."
3,very informative,The Earp Brothers of Tombstone is a very informative book. If you want something fast paced you might want to look somewhere else. But if you really want to hear the true story of Wyatt Earp and his brothers than this is the book for you!
1,Waters' Anti-Earp Screed,"Reading this tripe, you can see why Virgil Earp's widow, Allie, threatened to shoot Frank Waters on sight. For the enlightenment of the three people who don't know the story, Waters paid court to Allie Earp, pumping her for information. Allie had a bone to pick with Wyatt Earp and Waters ran with it. This collection of distortion and outright lies is the result. Waters no doubt gleaned the balance of his (mis)information from the Tombstone Nugget's pages or, most likely out of his own prejudices. Do bear in mind that the book was written during the height of the revisionist movement in the history of the ""old west"", and hatchet jobs on the notables of the time were common. The Earps were certainly not a bunch of altar boys, but they were definitely not the murdering pimps Waters makes them out to be. Maybe he was hired by the descendants of the McLowreys, some of whom still hold a grudge.This book would make good fire starter.Dennis Hanisch"
4,Lots of area history.,"I liked the fact of the amount of history in the book. The way the writer describes some of the scenery, it feels like you are there. Allie did not like Wyatt....she was a little snip. I would have like to have known what happened to Morg's wife and some of the others. And somethings she would not tell..... Overall I found it very interesting."
4,Information without all the hype,"I read this book a few years ago soon after the move Tombstone appeared on the big screen. I agree with the other reader that the book lacked the hollywood glitz but I really appreciated it. It was very informative and shed light on the Earps from a different angle. It really made the reader think. I went and watched the hollywood movies after reading the book and had a different impression all around. I am still researching the life and times of the Earps. I find that time period facinating. If you are looking for glitz you won't find a lot of here. But if you are looking for a good story with good facts of objective nature, then dig in."
4,Back in the (taxi)driver's Seat!,"A return to form, and a return to covers, for the great master. How can Bryan Ferry produce an album of cover songs and make it feel like an album of original compositions? Especially after an album of all originals (""Bete Noir"") that sounded more like Ferry doing parody covers of Ferry songs?!? Maybe a 6-year solo hiatus had something to do with it. Maybe the change of decades? I dunno. All I know is, this one does the job, and does it right!"
4,The previous reviewer is confused,"Jewel has nothing to do with this album. It is another album of covers by Bryan Ferry. As these things go, it isn't his best, but it's got some major highlights. His version of the title song, an obscure soul tune, is nearly worth the price of the disk. Ferry works like a watercolorist, sweeping gestures augmented by beautiful details. He is a highly controlled artist. His version of Answer Me, which is usually associated with Nat King Cole, is another highlight."
2,Get Back!,"Perhaps the worst version ever of""Will You Love Me Tomorrow."" Would've been a great Roxy Music number! Great example of 'Downer Rock'."
3,Worth it.,"I only like a couple of songs in this album, the rest is just so so. But it was worth it for me because I had to have HIS version of ""will you still love me tomorrow."""
5,"This has many familiar ""easy-listening"" songs.","If you like soft rock, this is one great album. You will recognize many of the songs on this cd. When I load up my 12 disk changer and put on the random setting, I always seem to have this one in there, as the tracks on this are all very good...a rare thing with most CD's."
2,A few good tracks but mostly formulaic and lacking hooks,"As big a Peter Cetera fan as I am, this is one album I easily live without. Tracks 1,2,3, and 5 are passable but don't compare favorably to World Falling Down, One More Story, or Solitude/Solitaire. The rest of the album all blends together, lacks any memorable hooks, and is at times unlistenable. It may not be entirely Peter's fault; the production here is consistently uninspired. There are so many wonderful albums in the world. Don't succumb to completism! You don't need this!"
2,you get what you pay for,i should have payed more attention to the product description i was under the impression that it was a little bigger the tub is very small and the things inside i wouldnt have paid for my daughter emptied it out and uses the tub to store her old crayola things i could have purchased regular tupperware!!!
5,Great gift!,"My 5 year old, who has recently fallen in love with coloring, said that this is the ""best gift ever"" - which surprised me! He loved the variety of stuff and I was introduced to several cool crayola products that I probably never would have picked up in the store. Love the re-usable plastic tub too - perfect!"
3,Good idea...eh.,"I think this is a great little gift for birthday parties and it was easy for me to just jump on amazon and buy. It has some paper, crayons, markers, dough...lots of little things but not a ton. I think for the money I probably could have pulled something a little nicer together BUT in a pinch it works great and the kids had fun!"
3,Pretty good tub of fun!,"I bought this for my nieces and nephews and they love it! It's not as big as I thought, like the size of a shoe box, but it had a lot of fun things in it."
4,Great for price,The only reason to be apprehesive about this set was the uncertainty of what the bin would contain. But it turned out to be well worth the risk. My daugther loves everything that came with the kit and it has kept her well entertained. Good buy.
5,Worth the money!,My daughter was so excited to open the tub. She uses the products every day. I love that everything (plus more) fits back in the tub.
3,I could take or leave it.,"The box is a sterlite shoe box style plastic container which is fine it's not low quality. The stuff inside I could take or leave it looked like someone threw in a bunch of odds and ends they had laying around. My son enjoyed most of it some of it left me confused because it was obviously part of something larger that had been broken up. I'm not sure it lived up to it's promises but I would not buy it again or recommend it, just buy what you want don't gamble."
2,looks like more fun in the photos than it actually is..,"Mush less materials than I thought. The ""fun"" books are tiny and there just wasn't as much in there as I thought it sounded like on the description. Could have got this stuff at the dollar store."
2,Fair weather friend,"Works great as long as the temperature is above 40 degrees Ferenheit. Once it gets below that you'll be forced to use the bubbles or you'll spend your day fighting this thing to get a consistent reading. (now I know why they put the bubbles in).Evidently those who rate this item high work in a mild climate. I don't.Lately the unit doesn't even want to calibrate in the vertical direction so I can't even use it above 40 degrees.Unfortunately I'll be sending it in for warrenty repair.When it works, it's nice. (Emphasis is on when it works.)"
2,poor product,"This level is not accurate! it will not match with its liquid boble, also will not be level with lazer level"
3,Beware - The description isn't accuratte,"I am in the middle of setting a suspension lift and needed a very precise method of measuring the angles and relationship between the differential flanges and transfer case flanges. After some research, the SmartTool seemed to be the answer. So when I read the companies description, it indicated the the module could be used by itself, with a 2' level, 4' or 6' level. So I ordered the 4' level believing I could use the module to measure the drive flanges and have a very accurate digital level also. WRONG. The level that contains the module is constructed so that the module is permantly installed. So now I own a very accurate 4' electronic level but I still need a small digital level to complete the original task.... Very frustrating.So if you need a short level, order just the module."
3,"Seems to work ok, hope it does ok when the weather gets cold","I love the features and so far so good. I am concerned about one of the other reviews that states it won't work in cold weather. Being a tool for a contractor there is no excuse for it not working in all types of weather. I am also not sure how it will hold up. Not that it looks cheap, but I can;t say it looks bulletproof either. In our business I need bulletproof, so a more expensive tougher unit may have been a better choice for us. I'll update later after a few months of use."
4,"Beautiful strap, a little slippery","I got this strap from Amazon because this particular Levy's Hootenanny strap is hard to find anywhere else. It's a beautiful strap in person and doesn't disappoint in either appearance or comfort. The one knock against it is the rather slick nature of the polypropylene backing. It's comfortable but if your guitar is neck-heavy this strap won't hold keep the guitar from sliding like a leather strap.That being said, this strap complements my guitar beautifully and I would have no reservations about buying it again, even with a little neck dive. :)"
3,Pretty but Flawed,"I must say I fell in love with this beautiful sconce once I saw it. After receiving it, everything was perfect and I quickly hung it up in my room. However, a major downfall to this piece is it changing colors. It is now a few months later and I constantly have to wipe the piece, which is hard to do because it is nailed up to the wall.<br />I love this piece but wish it wouldn't rust up the way it is."
2,Delayed Delayed Delayed,"Like some of the previous reviews, my order is also delayed for the 3rd time. It looks like they are trying to continue to delay until I cancel the order. I don't know if target is delaying or Amazon is, but either way it seems like a bad business practice to me. Will hold out anyway. This item looks awesome from the reviews and pictures, but it only gets two stars from me since...I won't be enjoying it as much after so much delay and was hoping to give it out as a christmas present!"
1,"delayed, bad business practice","like the previouse reviews, my order has been delayed three times also for over 4 months now. It seems like they will just keep delay it until I cancel the order. However, when i try to order the same item again at $34.99, it tells you at checkout that it's in stock and the prospect shipping date is 12/29 instead of febuaray. If they made a mistake on the price, why don't they just say so instead of wasting my time. I do not know whether it's amazon or target, but this is very bad business practice!"
1,Daughter will be in college before I get it!,"I ordered this the night I went into labor with my daughter, Sept 26, (what else is there to do while you wait for active labor?). My order has been delayed three times! My daughter will be in college before I get it! I will keep waiting because it will look awesome on my wall, but I am seriously miffed."
4,Beautiful product!!,"I received this product and it was packed very carefully, it was awesome! I love it and I've had nothing but compliments on this piece. I have had two people order this product from seeing it in my home. I have to say I have not lit the candles yet so I don't know how the results will be with the soot and the fact that it is screwed onto the wall, but I will certainly add a review when I get to that point and let you know. Aside from that I am not disappointed at all with my purchase!! Thanks Target for a wonderful piece!"
3,Tough to Read,"I HAD to get this for a film theory class. A lot of it was completely over my head, and I had a 3.8gpa in college, so I guess I'm lacking! ha ha Probably good if you have a dictionary of sorts to look up some of the words as you go, I'd never even heard of some of them before. Too ""stuffy"" for my taste."
1,"Typical, nothing new or exciting","I suppose I should mention that this book is not necessary to help facilitate your party plans. Billy Deans Showtime Cafe, Bellmore, New York, www.billydeans.com has been the winner for our last 3 bachelor parties. The club features ""Hot Oil Wrestling"" and $1 dollar dances. It is very much like partisipating in the movie ""Stripes"" with ""John Candy"" . I can honestly say there is no other place that comes close to this concept."
1,there is only one company to use for bachelor parties...,"These books are ok, but if you want to take the hasle out of planning the night & do it all for less than doing it yourself just go to Armcandygirls.com they planned it all, we didnt have to negotiate or stand in lines, they did it all, for less than if we planned it all out ourselves ,just tell em what you want to do and they take care of it all and it was hastle free..check them out and use the money you would have paid for this book on tips for the strippers..."
3,Only basic information of ports-of-call,"I was hopeful this video would help us plan a cruise to the Mediterranean next year but it provided nothing more than I got from books on the subject. No real information on the actual ports, how to get transportation to/from the ship, restaurants or shopping in area. This is just like a little travel log of the interesting tourist spots at each stop. Not bad, but clearly not special in any regard. Too bad."
2,Don't bother,This video isn't helpful at all. The photography looks really old and the shots are boring at best. It's like a very old fashioned travelogue.
5,SUCH a great CD,"This CD is just fantastic, get it! The quality of the songs is SUPER high, great melody and vocal parts, and none of it gets old on repeated listens."
5,Vunderfull!!!,"My Students Love these Books, from when I was a kid they were Popular in Monthly Book orders."
5,BUNNICULA'S REVIEW,"I think alot of people should read this book if they're not sure what to read.It is fun book to read, because of it's conflics, bravery, adventure, and humor. This book can apeal to all young and old people. It's and overall great book to read especially if your a young adult and want something fun to read.The one central problem of this book involves a bunny. It acts weird like a vampire. It acts so much like a vampire, it sucks juice out of vegetables and has a coat like a vampire cape. Later in the book the main characters have to find Bunniculas mother for ""Mother's Day"", because Bunnicula was adopted by the Monroes family when they found him at a movie theatre. The quest leads them to more problems and conflics. All these problems and conflics make the book so exciting. This book needs to be read by all students of all schools in the country. Who knows maybe the President"
4,Bunnicula strikes again,"I really liked the book beacuse it gave alot of details.Like when the dog went to the vet it said what color the shot was and I thought it was really cool.The cat and dog went to the theater to save the rabbit because it was being knocked down,and I could almost picture it in my head,The best part of the book is when they save the rabbit from the building.Another part is when the dog and cat get sprayed by a skunk.the worst part of the book is th first couple chapters the dog talks about what happen in the past books.Another is a chapter the dog is talking to the rabbit the whole time.The conflick in the book is the cat whants to kill the rabbit.the dog trys to stop him and tell him he is a nice vampire.The resoultion to the story is the cat finally finds out the rabbit is nice.The catlikes him so much that the food he stole he gave him some of his."
5,this is important,SIIIIIP GULPDO YOU HEAR THAT? IT SOUNDS LIKE SLURPING OF A RABBIT. IT SOUNDS LIKE BUNNICULA'S UP TO HIS BUISNESS AGAIN HURRY! WE BETTER CATCH HIM AT HIS WORK BEFORE WE HAVE TO EAT WHITE VEDGTABLES! OH NO! HE'SALMOST DONE BETTER HURRY! TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!..........!!!!!!!!!!..........?!
2,Totally Lame!,"This album was very lame and poorly done. With the exception of the songs ""Have We Forgotten What Love Is"", ""Eleven Roses"" and ""State of Mind"", the rest of the songs on the CD are terrible! They're just plain awful. She's got potential, she has a lovely singing voice but she didn't need to sing country music. I loved the duet she performed with Peter Cetera, ""Forever Tonight"". It was a beautiful soft rock duet. And I feel that her best genre would be to perform soft rock, pop flavored songs. I am rather disappointed that ""Forever Tonight"" wasn't included on the CD. But it's easy to see why this album was a flop, didn't sell very well and that it's now considered Out Of Print. It's boring. Now I actually like some country music but just not when Crystal performs it, she needs to be a pop star."
2,Crayola Color Wonder Refill,"I bought the refill Pad and found it to be pricey. Fun to use, translucent and glow in the dark effects are a result of using the refill with the non-spill-able paint that is with the actual Refill Fun for the little budding artist... would recommend. Fast Shipping and just what i wanted"
2,"Great entertainment, but stitching on one monkey arrived undone",I bought these monkeys to entertain my 11 month old on long flights. One monkey arrived with stitching under its dress already undone. I am out of time to return and get back for our next upcoming flight and am not happy ;-(
5,Not just Paper,this is an item that is a must have for the new artist in our future. There is something special when a child draws colors and give the gift made by hands that will only be this size once in there life. All my artists pics are on display in my home and what a georgious display it is.
5,Coloring,"This product was also ordered for my three year old grandson so he would have extra paper to draw on with his special markers. He loves to color and it keeps him busy for hours at a time, a real life saver for his mom who has three boys ages 4 and under!"
4,Simple But Fun,It's great to have a blank canvas for my child to draw on.. we're not big on Disney movies.Now instead of coloring characters he can use his own imagination.
4,Not easy to find,"I'm glad I finally found Refill Pads for Color Wonder products. I'm usually out of paper long before the markers run out so refills are very important! And I prefer blank pages to coloring books, so this is a great buy!"
4,Much better than the coloring pad,"My baby is only 20 months, so he has not grasped the idea of filling color in some spaces, and leaving some other spaces open. He just scribbles. And this pad is perfect for that, and mess free. The only reason I give 4 stars is that it does take time to develop color, and some times he is not that patient..."
4,A very good album!,"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this album because I had never heard of them before and didn't even know what type of music they were. Fortunately this album provided a unique blend of heavy guitars, heavily integrated keyboards (but not in a crappy 80's synthesiser way) and strong vocals. The lyrics are a bit cliche, but it adds comedy value to songs such as 'too much is never enough' and a little sentiment with strong ballards such as 'never said it was gonna be easy'. The bands sound resembles that of firehouse and white Lion, with plenty of fast guitar solo's, screaming vocals and catchy melodies. Check out the bands later project with open skyz which was the only two albums they ever did unfortunately. Overall, it does blend in a little with the rest of the hair metal bands of that era, but it is one of the best, just a shame they weren't recognised that much."
3,Nothing special here.,"Spies, a murder, and the Hardys undercover. This is just your average Hardy Boys. Nothing too special."
1,Very lifeless,"This is certainly a very well produced album, however I can't help but be bothered by Debbie's lack of energy. She comes across as very distant and quite arrogant. Seemingly quite out of touch with any feelings, and very full of not only her self, but her over-the-top showmanship."
4,Good Price for what you get,"This was a great way to hide our surround sound wires and a great way to display the speakers. They blend in with the rest of my living room decor. I was concerned that the speakers and wires would conflict with my light cherry finished furniture. They fit right it!The only complaint I have is that I must not have read well enough and I ordered 2, thinking I was ordering two speaker stands. Nope, two come in one shipping, so I ended up with 4. No big deal, for the price, we just kept them for our second living room. So, be careful and pay attention.A little cheap looking if they will be a focal point. These are better to go next to the back of the couch (out of site)."
5,Great Level,I am a Plumber and work on New housing. Most of the Waste Systems I install are cast iron for sound deading and this level hangs on to the pipe like a champ. I can leave the level on and strap the pipe in place with nails and the level will not come off. I have had several different Torpedo style levels and this is the best one I have used.
1,garbage!,"yeah yeah yeah blah blah blah....4 stars cuz it looks real pretty? This thing is junk. The caulk or whatever it is that holds the bubble vials in falls out, you lose the vials and you end up with a piece of pretty aluminumn......Klein makes a level with the SAME rare earth magnets (not the strip magnets) and is WAY more durable. BUY THE KLEIN."
3,You won't get what the title says.,"This is the old out dated Generation 2 level, not a G3 like the title says. It is still a quality level, but there are many improvements in the Generation 3 levels that make it better."
1,how can I review if you don't ship it,I've ordered this twice and continue to get delays - does it even exist?
2,not big enough bubble,The bubble is not big enough. There is too much room between the lines and the bubble allowing for too much variance in maintaining level.
2,Disappointed - Twice,"A few days after I bought this level brand new I noticed that the 0 degree vial was not true. It was significantly off when reversed. I sent it in to Checkpoint for warranty repair and received someone else's well-worn ""refurbished"" level in return. Now, two months later, the 90 degree vial is off. I can't use this thing for running conduit. Too bad; I like the magnets."
3,maybe a let down ??,"I saw the level and liked it so I ordered one. Still like the level itself but am somewhat disappointed with the craftmanship and materials used to construct it. One of the vials fell out during the second week. The earth magnets are showing some serious signs of wear after only two months of light duty use. As far as ordering another one, that is still up in the air, guess it will depand on my mood that day. Still like the concept of the level, just not to sure if corners are being cut in the manufacturing process."
2,Pretty...but...,"I gotta say that this torpedo level is a nice size, has a lot of features and looks great. However, one critical component is lacking...they filled the vials with too much liquid making the bubble so small it's nearly impossible to get an accurate measurement. I picked up a 9"" Swanson torpedo at the same time (just in case) and it's a much easier-to-read level, just like my Stabilas. The Checkpoint is going back."
5,best level for pipe bending (IBEW # 12),"This is the best level i have used for running conduit I really love it for for the amazing strength of the maganets,unlike other levels that either will not stay or with a little bump fall off.You can even leave it on the end of emt pipe while bending with a hand bender.Would definitely recommend this level"
5,Great little tool,THis was a gift for my husband. He thinks this is just the neatest little tool I have given him.
5,Only kind to buy,"This magnet is the best in its class. Its rugged enough to last from falls off lifts, or anything you can throw at them. The magnets are strong enough to hold it no matter what. Only kind I'll ever buy."
1,Level that's not level = Useless!,The one thing you expect a level to do is read level. Not the one I got. Checked this level against several other levels I own and it is greater than 1 degree off. Another gripe is that the bubbles are to small and allow to much wiggle room between the marks. I noticed the one in the picture has bigger bubbles so maybe I just got one from a bad batch. Sending it back.
5,Best torpedo level by far!!!!!,"As a seasoned electrician with the I.B.E.W. L.U. #8, I have tried many different levels over the years. This one outdoes, outlasts and outperforms any others I have used. The extra strength magnet virtually eliminates accidental falling due to tapping on conduit etc.. The accuracy and durability are unmatched by craftsman, Klein etc..Just try it and see for yourself!!!! You'll never use another torpedo level."
1,"Actually deserves a ""0""","Do not buy this level. It is not accurate. When the bubble is centered in the horizontal position it is actually not level. I returned the first one I received and got a replacement. The second was just as bad as the first. To make matters even worse, the bubble is small and the lines are far apart so the bubble doesn't touch the lines. That makes it very hard to tell if the bubble is in the center. I placed it on top of a large contractor's level just to be sure, and the bubble was way off center on this one when the contractor's level bubble was centered."
5,The Best Level Made !,"I love this level and all the other guys want one too.IBEW Local # 3 NYC baby ! You just gotta have one if you bend ANY pipe from 1/2 "" to 4"" or what ever. It's just great."
4,checkpoint level,"I use it everyday for work to level,plum an square my scaffold its a very important tool in the work place."
3,checkpoint 300 level,"I've got a couple of friends that each have one of these and they swear by them so I bought one and liked it so much that I ordered another.Then the second time I used it I dropped it about 3 feet and the glue plug popped out which held in the main or horizontal bubble, the plug won't stay in and the level is now not accurate. The second level hasn't arrived and I wish I hadn't ordered it."
3,"good, but went out and only guaranteed for 1 year","Mine went out after a while,(OK quite a while) I go to return it and their website says only one year guarantee. I Will replace it with one that come with lifetime guarantee."
5,Frankie Avelon,"Frankie Avelon was one of the best. His song ""Venus"" is to this day one of the prettiest recordings ever made."
2,Designed to break,"Beware if you have children. The flashers are poorly designed and will break if touched a few times. They plug into the Fastrack crossing, but if they're bumped during play or removed and replaced a few times for storage, they break where the post meets the plug. I'm handy, and wasn't able to repair them. The wires inside the posts are very thin and can't be soldered at the break. Couldn't find replacement posts. Given that Lionel products are used by kids, they should be designed to last longer, particularly given the steep prices."
1,"The lighst go out, very quickly.","I bought the Polar Express along with some tracks and and this crossing for my four year old. The concept is great and the workmanship is very nice. The only problem, and it is a big one -- The poles come out at the joint even with a slight touch and the connecting wires break and, the lights go out. One could still play the sound but the repair of the wires is impossible because the way they are made. All in all, it is not worth the $60 that I spent."
1,Very fragile,"I am very disappointed by this crossing, The flash is so fragile and got broken the day after I opened it."
3,"Looks nice, not super comfy.",Bought this for my husband as a present. He doesn't wear them much because there is not a lot of cushioning under the feet. Otherwise seems pretty nice.
4,One of 1987's most wrongly neglected Soul albums.,"This was one of the most criminally neglected Soul albums of its time. John White's powerful, soulful, earthy and Gospel-infused Soul vocals are truly a pleasure to hear and such great songs as ""Forbidden Love"", ""Don't Let It Be Too Late"" and the minor hit ""Can't Get You Out Of My System"" make this CD eminently enjoyable. Sadly, this album was very poorly promoted and failed to get the recognition and sales it naturally deserved. The fact that it's now on CDshould make it a ""must-have"" for any fan of romantic and passionate Soul. Enjoy!"
3,Bosch case for the Digital Protractor,This is a nice level case. Bosch does make a case for the Digital Protractor. It is model #2605439017. However it does seem very hard to find. Maybe somebody knows where we all can get one and can leave us a link to where to get it.
5,Thank You TCI,Throw your B&M in the junk and treat yourself to a great working shifter! Used in my 68 Mustang.....this is a very smooth shifter!
4,Plumb-It Extendable Level 5.0,"This is a wonderful tool. One of my partners suggested we get one and I kept putting it off, now I wonder why I waited so long. We can now plumb 12 foot garage walls using top and bottom plates for extreme accuracy. It also makes basement walls easier to frame. My gables are always plumb and roof overframing is a breeze with a 13 foot straight edge. I think we are the only crew in town using this tool and that definitely gives us an edge over the competition."
3,Not enough social history,"This book is essentially a manuscript of memoirs, (the impression I had was a thesis) written by the daughter of a Naval officer stationed at Pearl. The day-to-day details of pre-war life in Hawaii (considered an exotic location to most Americans in the early '40s) are well described. The civilian impressions of post-attack Honolulu are also the strengths of this work. The book is less successful as it attempts to describe the progress of the war. It probably would have been better to relate the war news ""as heard"" at the time, and the ups and downs of civilian morale dealing with the news, and the thousands of servicemen descending on the islands.All in all, a fairly good read, but not an in-depth memoir of civilian life in wartime Hawaii."
3,HARD TO RATE,"I am a huge fan of the Beach Boys and a huge fan of country music. It is undeniable that country has influenced the Beach Boys, as did many other types of music. However, some of the songs are really poor matches with the artists who covered them. For example, Mark Miller's awful interpretation of ""I Get Around"" is not bearable to listen to. On the other hand, Willie Nelson meshes his sound with Brian Wilson's for a painless rendition of ""Warmth of the Sun"". Lorrie Morgan does a song that is really a ""man"" song, and therefore, the lyrics don't work, and Junior Brown does a great job on his song. ""I Can Hear Music"" is not at all up-to-snuff with the Beach Boys' version, but ""Caroline, No"", could almost fool you into thinking it was the original, if you weren't listening extra-carefully. It is an odd mix that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't work."
2,Please! Don't Release Volume 2!,"To be fair, there are some nice moments on this CD, particularly Willie Nelson and Junior Brown. Beach Boys fans may be better served if this was not labelled as a Beach Boys album and if the Beach Boys had nothing to do with this. The country artists are not the problem on this CD but the Beach Boys are. Most of the group's 90s CDs are painful to listen to and this one is no exception. Why this is in print and not ""Surf's Up"" or ""Sunflower"" is truly puzzling."
4,Beach Boys with their favorite country singers,"This is a one of a kind album with the Beach Boys on harmony in the background and country singers on lead vocals. I am not a huge fan of country music, which is why I do not rate this a 5 star album. My parents and bro heard this album when I first bought it, and they said ""what did you buy?!!"" I especially like the song ""Long Tall Texan"" on this album and on the Beach Boys Concert/Live in London album. This is out of print since 2001, and there will probably never be a Volume 2 of this album. If you like tribute albums and country music, you probably would like this ablum, if you don't like tributes or country music, you probably don't want to spend your money on this album."
2,"It's got a good beat and I can dance to it, if I must.","Do you have a friend or relative who is mad about country music, while you generally can't stand the stuff? Well, when your mother-in-law comes over and insists on demonstrating her new line-dancing steps, pop in this album and let 'er rip to ""Little Deuce Coupe"" or one of the other uptempo numbers. It'll be more than tolerable; it'll be fun."
1,"Dear God, why, Why, WHY?!?!","This can't be real. I hope I'm hallucinating.Nope.The Beach Boys (that is to say, Brian Wilson) created incomparable pop music at their peak...Let's just say that this is very much NOT their peak.What kind of depraved fear of originality would yield an album composed entirely of covers? And not just covers, but covers of unbeatable pop masterpieces? This is why no one repects the Beach Boys, folks. They're making a JOKE of themselves.Is this supposed to be a tribute album? Come on, tribute albums are pathetic, and it's pointless to do a tribute to songs that couldn't be improved on by anyone except maybe (BIG maybe) God. Please. Please. Please, if anyone can hear me out their, don't fall into this trap! Buy yourself Pet Sounds, discover the unrivaled divinity of the music contained within, and proceed from there.And, as long as I'm here, I really don't like Kokomo either."
1,I didn't like the movie either.,Ii didn't like the movie either! I deleted the book from my e-reader. I just fell under the holiday spell and didn't realize what I was ordering!
3,Tough to get through,"Somehow I could not get into the voice of the book. I know the author also narrated the movie, but I just could not get to hear his voice when reading the book. I thought I would, but no. I didn't find it terribly entertaining. As head of AUDIN Web Design, I had a tough time getting others to appreciate the value of the great piece of work. I would have to say, it just doesn't meet up to the movie."
5,Some of the Best of Shepherd,"The only thing lacking in this book is actual audio of Jean Shepherd. If you love his voice from his old radio broadcasts, you can imagine it sounding in your brain as you read his hysterically funny riffs on working class family life, school, being a kid in the 1940s - 50s. Wildly entertaining."
4,A GREAT GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS STORY FANS,"If you're a fan of the movie, ""A Christmas Story,"" you'll enjoy this book. It was the basis for the popular film which is now a seasonal classic. I bought it as a gift for my son, and of course I had to read it myself first. If you cherish the memory of Ralphie's visit to Santa, his pink bunny outfit or the Bumpus hounds theft of the turkey, you'll probably love reading the source of all those moments. I highly recommend it and look forward to presenting it to my son on his birthday!"
3,Bumpy ride,"First, I must say I did not purchase this chair because the one at the store did not glide as smoothly as other models. It feels like it has a small bump along the way. When mentioned to the sales person, I was told that the chair had been returned for that reason. They had another one on display, same bump, but a less noticable. If you can live without smoothness at that price, it is a very roomy and comfy reclining chair. I thought I had found my dream chair. What a disappointment. The smaller Dutailier has been great so far."
2,Comfy but POOR manufacturing,"We tried to buy this chair - twice - and had to return both items to the store due to manufacturing defects. The first chair was crooked, with a large gap between the seat and frame. The second made an annoying clunking noise on every forward glide. Upon close examination of the second chair, we found several cracks in the wood at fastening points. We also felt that the screws used to fasten the back to the frame were not sufficiently strong to guarantee safety. Instead of trying a third time, we purchased a Dutailier for $40 less and are thrilled with it."
5,"Awesome, comfortable glider & ottoman",We ordered this to arrive when our baby was born. Tried every chair in the store & this one blew the others away comfort wise! We did not experience the squeaking that others mentioned. It has been perfect since day 1. My baby girl & I have spent a lot of time in this-so comfy-you can even sleep in it. It's large enough that my husband is also very comfy in it. Nice enough to have in another room in the house when the baby gets older. Worth the money!
5,No complaints here...,"We purchased this rocker after our son was born in January,and have absolutely no compliants. It is so much more comfortable than all of the others we tried, and we were surprised at how easy it was to assemble - only 4 screws. I am 6 ft tall, so maybe we needed something a little larger. We are also impressed by the auto locking safety feature. It locks when you stand up, and unlocks when you sit down. I spend many hours in it at night, and am glad we invested the extra money..."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"I wanted something that would be large enough to hold my cat's urn and a few of his toys. This was perfect. We can look at him now without being sad. The only thing that prevented a 5-star rating was that it did arrive with a small crack. Easily fixed, but many other people have complained of the same problem."
2,Very Disappointed,"This product looked beautiful and had great reviews when I was in desperate need of a special place to keep my cats ashes. I bought it with expedited shipping and received it 2 days after I'd already gotten my cat's ashes back. The entire base was cracked in half which I had to glue back together, and the sockets for the screws were completely chipped apart. the screws wouldn't go back into them and I had to glue the entire piece closed. It says it holds 3 x 5 photos so I had some made of my cat, and they were much to large and I ended up having to cut part of them off. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product. Had it arrived on time, and in good condition I would give it 5 stars, because it is a beautiful piece, but sadly I wouldn't ever purchase another again."
4,Relaxing Review,"""Watching the River Run"" is not only a song title, it also describles this flowing journey through musical time. Jim takes us back through his career starting with Buffalo Springfield, through Poco, Loggins and Messina, and finally his solo career. Listening to this CD reminds me of the impact he had on music in the 60's and 70's. Please don't think that this is an oldies collection. The reworking of these familiar tunes has a relaxing southwest flair. While you may be reminded of the past, you are clearly in the present. Jim's solo work remains my favorite and this may be the only place to find a couple of his best. ""Follow Your Dreams"", a dad's advice to his child, is superb and ""Mexican Minutes"" will rival any Jimmy Buffet song for tropical relaxation. Jim, keep the music coming."
1,Sorry teakettle,"I am so angry at this copper teakettle. It took an act of congress to get the crud off the outside of the pot in order to use it. The handle did not come off as stated, so the handle and the wooden top are different colors. I was able to use the teakettle one time. The next time, I had water everywhere on my stove as the bottom of the spout leaked. Needless to say, I want my money back and will definitely be shipping this item back."
1,Decoration Only,"Kettle will handle only 2 cups NOT 2 quarts, looks nice, but is not useful nor practical. I would recommend for a decoration piece, but not to be used."
2,Pot's the pits,"Although it looks good, the tea kettle leaks. I purchased it as a gift, and my mother only uses it to water her plants, not to boil water, but it leaks where the spout joins the body. I figured I would have to pay big bucks for a ""boilable"" kettle, but didn't really think that ""decorative"" meant you can't use it for anything but wasting copper polish."
2,Decorative ONLY,"We put this on our registry to replace my old copper kettle, intending to use it AS a kettle. What a disappointment! After three rounds, I still could not remove all the lacquer - which must be removed for safe use - but the stainless steel was showing through in large patches. The feeble copper finish isn't as strong as the lacquer that covers it. Frustrating waste of time & had to return it in the end.In short: I give it two stars because it would be awful cute as decor. But it's certainly not cookware."
4,Happy,I love the look and functionaltiy of this teakettle. The only difficulty was in removing the tarnish resistant coating before use. I'm still not certain i got it all off. But it was delivered very quickly and is a lovely accent to my kitchen that i can use every day!
1,"Awful, awful, awful","Please do NOT be fooled by the good ratings this book received, as I was. If you were going on the title of the book, as well as the positive reviews this book received, you'd naturally expect something clever and helpful. This is not the case. I was very disappointed to find that the book is pretty useless. It is portrayed in a childlike manner, filled with poor quality sketches instead of photographs or decent drawings. The font used is huge, and there are a few typos too. Most irritating, however, is the tone the author uses ""Don't be afraid to ask for help from the big strong boys"" or how about ""You can still be strong without being tough""... and the ever dominating theme of the book seems to be summed up in ""Males like females who signal, but the signal can't be too enouraging or the girl will appear cheap."" Believe me, you want to pass on this one."
5,Not just for teenagers!,"Thank you Raymond McGraime, you are truly the master of Flirting, Dating and Romance, as well as, in the art of body language. I'm in my mid-twenties and since I've been using the tips from your book I've been getting more dates than ever. I wish I had this book when I was a teenager. For all the ladies (young and old) this is a book to get. I've learned what I've been putting out there by my walk, my stance, my facial expressions, and much much more. And the men will notice! You'll notice too, I feel so much more confident and aware of myself. Knowing how to use your body and what your body language is projecting definitely gives you the edge. For the ladies that are beyond there teenage years the rules still apply in business and in pleasure. If there's one book to buy this year let it be this, you will truly not regret it. I hope each reader will enjoy it as much as I have."
1,Asinine,I really found the excerpts to be asinine and insulting to females. Being an independant attractive female(by male standards) I found the advice given in this book to attract males ridiculous! Why pretend to play games and be attracted to a person? This does not set up an environment of mutual self respect and honest communication. What are you then supposed to do for the rest of your life? Continue to play out these ridiculous scenario's to keep this person attracted to you? These were techniques we talked about amongst girls at age 16. And even then they didn't work. No disrepect to the author because I'm sure there's some valid research for this drivel but personally I think this book is demeaning to women and should be removed from your list.
5,You got Danny Elfman on my Shostakovich!,"This is a wonderful CD. A fun concoction sounding like Kurt Weill, Shostakovich and Prokofiev and strained through Danny Elfman's head. Tracks that standout for me: Circus In Outer Space, Bear Waltz, Big Top.As much as I enjoyed the Errol Morris film (and I enjoyed it very much) I hope this ""film music"" becomes ""music"" on its own right - it seriously deserves it."
4,"Pleasant, diverse, orchestral soundtrack.","Errol Morris's _Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control_ is a very unconventional documentary in which four men -- a lion tamer, a topiary hedge maker, an expert on naked mole rats, and a robotician -- describe their work.Calab Sampson's wonderful soundtrack of upbeat but mischievous orchestral pieces fits the visuals well. Most, but not all, stand up to casual listening."
4,Great Shorts,Very comfortable shorts with style and high Speedo quality. Definitely one of the best pairs of swimm trunks I've purchased.
3,Men's Speedo,"I was disappointed to find out later when my husband went to wear the suit that the pocket already had a hole in it. I already returned one suit,and I wasn't going to go through the hassle and loss of money to return another."
4,Love it!,"I have the 2ft framing version of this level, and I bought this to fit tighter spaces. It's a great product. I would have given it 5 stars if it were a little bit smaller."
3,MD Smart Tool for Trail Work,"The MD Smart tool is good for determining the grade of a slope where one is considering a road or trail. It is not very useful as a level or clinometer as it has no way to tell when you are holding it on the specified grade. For that purpose get an Abney or Clinometer.It is fast and has a hold setting that retains the setting.The on off switch is not protected so it is easy to turn the thing on when you do not want it turned on, thereby burning batteries. Some sort of lock mechanism or a harder to turn on switch would help this situation.Portland Or"
4,boss wanted this,"My boss wanted me to get this to replace the damaged module in his 4' level. With some modifications it did the job. I don't understand why he didn't use it as is, or just get another 4' level. by the time the modules are busted the level normally isn't worth putting a new one in ... my opinion anyhow"
1,Grades 5-8 deserve better,"I read this book in advance copy quite awhile ago and was surprised to find that it was actually published, considering how thoroughly wretched it is. Each character is as flat as a cardboard cutout from a comic shop fantasy display, and the dialogue is muddled at best. The plot seems to be some kind of take on ""The Pied Piper"" padded out with completely pointless action scenes that do nothing to either advance the plot or breathe some life into the protagonists. There is the occasional glint of genuine humor (I can only think of one right now) but these moments are generally buried under what feels to be the trappings of a confused D&D; game inexplicably turned into a book.If you're in the age group this book is marketed at, take my advice: read Terry Brooks, David Eddings, or Kristen Britain and then work your way into more challenging material. Heck, even that Eragon book is better than this."
1,A genuine catastrophe,"This book strikes me as a combination of RL Stein, without the original plot, JK Rowlings, without the descriptive imagery, and JRR Tolkein, without the grand theme. The non-ending is so out of character with the rest of the book it will leave the reader wondering why anyone would buy the sequel. If there were a zero on the scale, I would give it."
3,"OK, but one of the BEST Jennifer LP's is STILL not on CD...","OK, this is a stunning, if uneven third album from Jennifer, with highlights being the single ""Heart on the Line"" and her remake of ""Givin' Up"" (first made famous in the mid-70s SPARKLE movie sung by long-lost diva LONETTE MCKEE!)...BUT WHY WHY WHY hasn't Geffen re-issed Jennifer's SECOND full album, ""HARD TIMES FOR LOVERS"" on CD since her other two are re-issed on CD? This is really tragic, since album tracks like ""JUST A MATTER OF TIME"" contain some of Jennifer's most relaxed, confidence, & downright SOULFUL vocal performances - PLEASE Geffen re-issed this sophomore CD for the FANS!! I have it on LP, but it's worn out & scratched by now - who can forget ""Hard Times for Lovers,"" ""No Frills Love,"" etc - Arthur Baker's mid-80s production really rocked the house!! -"
5,Just buy it,"There is one reason only to buy this album, the reason of course is that it's by Jennifer Holliday, perhaps the most overlooked female singer around. In my opinion : The Greatest Female Singer around. Just listen to 'Read It In My Eyes' & 'Givin Up' (need I say more). This Lady just sings with emotion, she's awsome."
1,POOR,"Never have viewed such poor content and quality DVD, which was immediately visible. Had to send it back."
4,Progressive Post-Punk Gem - Much Imitated,"Chameleons are one of those bands that toiled in obscurity creating a singular sound that other bands would water down and find success with.They were influenced by the usual suspects themselves (Joy Division, Siouxsie etc.), but brought an epic scope and progressive sophistication to their chosen style.This album has a depth that rewards many listens and can usually be found in the bargain rack. Give it a try."
4,Discover this band NOW!,"I don't like this album quite as much as Script of the Bridge, which grabs you and never lets go. The Chameleons tone down the driving rock for some slower numbers here, and they're not my favorites. HOWEVER, balancing that out are the two BEST Chameleons songs ever: Soul in Isolation and Swamp Thing!There are 6 bonus tracks that make an entire play-through a little unwieldy, but two of them are great: Paradiso and they really put their stamp on Tomorrow Never Knows."
2,Haphazard work.,"I've adored this band since their first release. And this release does have it's moments. All in all, however, much of it sounds like they were writing while the tapes rolled and it sounds unrehearsed. Especially the vocals. If it were marketed as a live recording or rare basement recordings, I could let it slide but as a major release, the craftsmanship is haphazard. And without the bonus CD that originally came with it, there's not a lot for me to recommend. I do give it two stars for a couple of reasons. First, if you can find a copy with the bonus CD, that's where the best material was. Second, I still feel these guys were hugely underrated and one of the more important bands of the time so, if you're a fan, I'd still recommend rounding out your collection with it. If you don't have any Chameleons, buy ""Script of the Bridge""."
2,Going against the tide ...,"I bought this CD several years ago for one song - Swamp Thing - which is always a risk. I love the song but the album is not all that great. It seems self-involved, almost pretentious. All I can think of is a bunch of art school students dressed in black thinking that they are going to change the face of music and this is what they came up with.The songs are not too distinct from one another, the lofty and over-dramatic vocals fail to impress. Makes me think of a ""new wave"" Jethro Tull or Marillion.For me this was a pretty unimpressive disc."
5,Utterly brilliant!,"This band was one of those rare gems that never got the attention of the masses. Probably because instead of making great pop songs that sounded good on the radio, they made great music that one had to go beyond the radio playlist to discover. This album, Strange Times, captures The Chameleons when they were at their zenith. For those of you who feel lonely or isolated, you'll swear this album was made especially for you."
5,This should be in every serious music lover's collection!,"If there is one ingredient in the Chameleons music - it's emotion. Every track, every note, every lyric is filled with passion and heart-wrenching feelings - joy, sorrow, fear, hope. I first listened to this album as a college freshman and the music helped me through a difficult year. I have been listening to the Chameleons music ever since, obtaining practically everything they have ever released. Songs like ""Swamp Thing"", ""Soul In Isolation"", ""Caution"", ""Childhood"" and ""Tears"" leave such an impact it's difficult to recover. The route this album takes is from confusion, despair, loneliness to maturity, remembrance, and hope, most of all hope, as in the final lyrics that Mark Burgess sings in ""Childhood"" attest: ""I hope we'll both be very, very, very, very, very, very happy..."". This is a tremendous, spectacular album - unforgettable in every respect."
2,One idea repeted over 288 pages,The authors have one good point about high-het-worth psychologythat is repeted over and over again. The book is written for loweducation readers. It is written double spaced just to increase the number of pages (?). I would not recommend this book to a friend.
3,Good book but not worth $60,"The authors display a solid understanding of the HNW arena. The book offers a good break down of how to categorize different affluent personalities and what to cater to for these customers. It offers an intraspective look at the different needs and concerns that various customers have. My only citique lies in the constant repeativeness through out the book. This could have beeen written in half of the amount of pages, but for some reason the authors felt it was important to make the readers reread every issue numerous times. Overall, a good tool for any sales person trying to understand and cater to the HNW customer but definitely way over priced"
5,Essential reading for all investment advisors,This book explains how to do the right kind of job with clients. It lays out the best ways to connect with them. I've just started using the ideas and already I'm closing more business.
4,G-Rod says,"This toy is great and my puppy loved it, BUT, she is a very small breed and young. She loved playing with it, but the fibers would come off and choke her. She does fine with other toys that are plastic or have a smooth cloth covering. Maybe the manufacture will give us an option. I would buy it again then."
3,Bedside Prayers,The book is in fairly good condition. There is some yellowing of the pages but it is consistent. Maybe this is the way the book is made to look like. I would have liked a little more substance to the prayers and poems . Over all I am satisfied
4,Bedside Prayers,"I found several very inspirational writings in this book, which is divided into categories. I would recommend it to those looking for collections of various inspirational writings sorted by topics."
3,Just good,"I didn't find these poems especially well written. I began suspecting that they were written by students in an community adult education poem-writing class. I noticed that at the end of the book, the author invited submissions from readers for future books. So I was right in that these prayers and poems were not written by professionals.I also noticed that about 90% of the poems and prayers were written by women (why was that?), and noticed that the women's poems had a different quality about them than the men's. I'm not sure what that quality was. Might make for an interesting study!"
1,Zero Stars!,"Got no pie, no replies to my email, nothing. Amazon refunded my money. Very disappointing as I had ordered from them in 2004 and was very happy. Are they still in business??"
2,They are no longer in business,I live in the city were Peggy Jean's used to be. They went out of business in 2005. They had the best pies I had ever tasted!
3,A lesser selection of newer Beetle,"Newer Beetle Bailey strips just aren't as consistently funny as the earlier classics. Nevertheless, this book still should appeal to ardent fans."
3,JUST A BIT AHEAD OF THEIR TIME,"I am not sure why I am writing this review but maybe it is because there are no other reviews for this title. I own the CD and have for several years. It was bought on a whim at a local pawn shop and it was a very pleasant surprise. I like the sincerity of the music as well as the vocals.If you like rock fused with rockabilly and a touch of banjo, you will like this effort. They do a great job of carrying you from one song to the next and making you feel as if you are going through the same issues as they are. It is very real and very pleasing.I wish they had more to offer!"
5,man of the family,"It took me awhile to finish it but I love love loved all the parts with horses and other animals. This was a great book but it had the most awful ending I've ever read. It reminded me of the little house on the prarie books. Funny, interesting and sometimes miserable or sad.I would have adored this book if the ending had been something else. Dont continue reading if you havent read it yet.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ralph moves from Coloradoe to BOSTON!!!!!! THe city!!!!! It broke my heart, hurt my head and dissapointed me sooooo much. I didnt need a happy go lucky ending, but that was the worst. He has to leave the horses, rabbits, cow and all his friends and everyone and most of all beautiful coloradoe for,.....boston? and it;s all his mother's fault. she tells some secret or something and ruins the whole end of the book. i guess it's just being realistic but still......"
5,Great auto-biography series by a true American Cowboy!!!,This is the third book in the wonderful auto-biographical series by American Cowboy Ralph Moody. A must read for individuals and families. I received a terrific copy at a reasonable price and with speedy delivery. Thanks!!!
5,Great Biography Series,"This is a great true story for ages 6-105. A little bit of cowboy language but going to the park is far worse. Action, adventure, joy, hardship, love of family & friends,... it's all there. Very eye opening. I'm so glad audio versions are coming out so we can enjoy them together on long car trips or when sick in bed. Worth the money."
4,This is a very good series of books!,I love the Spooksville series. They are always having new adventures and getting smarter throughout the series. I especially like Adam. These are very refreshing books after all the murders in the R.L.Stine books. I would advise this to lots of kids. I hope to see more in the series!
3,Disappointed,"I read the other reviews and had high hopes for this product. I already had the kind that pushpins into the wall, but got one of these so that I wouldn't have to patch the tiny holes. Unfortunately, when I removed the tape, it held onto the wall and took a piece of my waLl with it. Now I have a bigger area to patch!"
2,Cheap,"Mine broke after being dropped twice from a height of about 4 feet. Sucks, but I didn't pay much for it. Difficult to mount to walls repeatably."
5,Great for household jobs,"This is good product for the money, The laser beam is easy to see and it's easy to use."
2,not as expected,* Horizontal line not leveled* light too weak.. and you won't see it very clearly* Material too cheep - which is OK for such a price* not that easy to useConclusion.nice to have but don't rely on it that much
4,Very handy,"Me and my wife used this to help with hanging paintings. Very helpful, worked as advertised.(Also have great fun making our dog chase the beam!)"
3,Tool,I was disappointed in this level. It has to be hung on the wall to work. The manufacture sent four putty picture hangers with the unit so it could be hung without nails. Not a good design. If you hammer or use a hammer drill guess where the laser level ends up. You got it right on the floor.
4,Good read,"The story was entertaining and well put together. It was some what predictable, but still a fun book to read."
5,Sleazy Sophistication!,"Bete Noire and Boys and Girls represent Ferry at the pinnacle of his artistic output, at least in my opinion. Albums such as Taxi have never neared this level of artistry nor managed to evoke such emotion. The dark undercurrents of a sophisticated sound are the perfect formula, making Bete Noire the perfect follow-up to Boys and Girls.This album thus sounds as fresh as it did when it was initially released."
5,Better than Boys and Girls!,"While I love Ferry's Boys and Girls album, I think Bete Noire is more creative and diverse. It's also more atmospheric, and haunting at times. The song ""Zamba"" always paints an image in my mind; like maybe his lover's lost in the woods during the fall. He talks about how her feet don't touch the ground. Then it starts getting colder and the leaves all start to fall. He can see her clearly now. My interpretation was always that she died and went to heaven, and that he could see her spirit in the sky. It's just such a haunting and powerful song, with an ambient feel to it. The rest of the songs on Bete Noire are great too. It's one of those albums you can play all the way through, over and over."
5,Even better with extra tracks!,"This is a positive review. However there doesn't seem to be any reviews for a product released in Australia for the accompanying tour for this album. That release had four extended versions to close the album: Kiss and Tell, Limbo, The Right Stuff and Bete Noir (instrumental). Now that was an album!!I am interested as to why it doesn't appear anywhere on Amazon."
2,The Wrong Stuff.,"I suppose everyone is entitled to at least one weak album, but did he have to do a third-rate reiteration of ""Boys and Girls""? The one thing I always expect from Mr. Ferry is the unexpected, but I never expected him to go over so much of the same (tired) ground as his prior record. The content of this album gives the impression of being stuck in a rut. Flabby and uninspired."
2,Empty Craft,"I can appreciate the care that went into this album's execution, but the end result is enervating and dry. With a beat straight from Timex and lyrics from Hallmark, Bete Noire typifies the synthesized nadir of the 1980's. (An extra star, though, for the not-bad title track)."
3,way too expensive,"This German Reader maybe nice but the price is just ridiculously high. For that amount you can go to amazon.de and get some ""real"" books for a much better price. Pool your orders and then the $14 flat rate shipping charge is not that outrageous. I also find the drawings outdated and cheap. I am returning the book."
3,"A little pricey, but cute","I thinnk this a good book for any person who is interested in learning German. I will say, it is a little overpriced since the book is small. If you want a big bang for your buck, not worth it, but if you're willing to spend a little extra, then it's a good pruchase."
2,Just Stupid Pt. 2,"Crapulent. I kind of liked the first one. Even though it had a silly ending, it scared the pants off me. But this, was just stupid. I didn't mind the characters, they all did a decent job. The acting, the directing, the scenery and the cinematography are all okay. It's the story that is weak and full of holes. They tried to turn Rest Stop 2 into a ghost story. Too bad it really doesn't work. There are just too damn many holes and things that make absolutely no sense. I didn't hate it, but it was frustrating to watch."
3,Movie Info,"One year after running away from home, Nicole (Julie Mond) and Jesse (Joey Mendicino) are still missing. When Jesse's brother, Tom (Richard Tillman), returns home from active duty, he sets out with his friends Marilyn (Jessie Ward) and Jared (Graham Norris) to locate the lost couple. Their search leads them to the stretch of old highway with a mysterious Rest Stop, where they find themselves in the same predicament as Nicole and Jesse: confronting the madman (Brionne Davis) driving the menacing yellow truck. As their search continues, a run-in with the ubiquitous Winnebago Family leads Marilyn and Jared to ghostly encounters with Nicole. Meanwhile, Tom is kidnapped and tortured by the psycho, but upon his escape he uses the arsenal at his disposal to take his revenge. But bullets alone may not be enough to stop this sociopath bent on death and dismemberment."
3,"Good, Not as good as the first","The Movies good, Not as good as the original rest stop, but worth a rent at least. kinda gives you a little back story on both the creepy family in the RV and the Guy in the Yellow truck. Its not what you think!"
2,Disappointing sequel!,"While the first Rest Stop movie was still watchable and had some scary and moving scenes, this sequel is almost entirely disappointing at every turn. The suspense and dramatic occurances of the first film are simply missing in this rather boring sequel, and the acting isen't better than last time, perhaps even worse.To make matters worse this one feels contrived and rather unnatural in its make up; the torture scene at the end seemed far too mandatory and routine for my taste, and it came across as a way to keep the horror fans in line, who needless to say, probably comprise about at least 80% of the potential audience of this movie.Therefore, not worth seeing."
2,Thumbs Down,"I was excited to watch this movie after enjoying the first Rest Stop. I should have listened to everyone else's reviews. This movie was awful. Quite humorous at times, but just flat out crappy. Don't waste your time buying or renting. Wait until you can watch it for free on cable."
3,Engrossing,What makes this movie good is that it follows on from the previous one.The main characters from that movie have a part in this movie-from beyond.I'd recommend it for those who like to be on the edge of their seat.
5,Great Sequel,"Great sequel to the origional. Refreshing and interesting. This film picks up where the first left off with 3 friends of the origional cast searching for their friends. Terror ensues and with a way more structured story, characters and some explinations as to the orgions of the killers this is a superior sequel. Csn't wait for Rest Stop III."
1,SEQUEL TO A VERY BAD MOVIE,"I'm here just to warn you people that this title is the sequel of a TERRIBLE film called rest stop , i sugest you take a look at the product BEFORE you pre order this one in an impulse , i have seen trailers of THIS film and it seems terrible too , and taking in consideration that SEQUELS are generally WORST then the original ..... and the ORIGINAL sucks ........ well , you do the math ."
2,Crayola Color Womder Coloring Book and Markers,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. The colors were not very sharp as with regular markers. The marker covers go back on easily but would be difficult for a young child to fully snap in place as is required to fully close. Overall I was disappointed as I have always been a fan of Crayola brand.
4,Gift for cousin,"I thought the shirt was very unique and stylish. However, my cousin did not seem too impressed. This was a Christmas present."
2,Leaky Little Bugger,"The feeder looks wonderful. It really does. The main trouble is the wind, or should I say breeze. Thats all it takes to make this feeder tilt and pour the feeding solution all over the ground. It simply swings too freely in the slightest breeze, unfortunate really because it is a very good looking feeder. For looks buy it, for feeding skip it.Ron"
3,Nice facade,"This hummingbird feeder is so attractive. I loved it's unique feeder appearance. However, it is made in China. Within one week, it began to rust at it seams. Also, the way the water bottle slides up from the bottom into the metal housing, doesn't create a good seal when the bottom pushes up against it, allowing the nectar to slowly leak out. Also, for some reason, the hummingbirds won't sit on the perches like they did on my old feeder. I'm not sure why, but they just don't. I would not recommend this feeder."
5,Crayola has another winner.,"Crayola has made a career out of coming up with products for kids of all ages; the Mess Free Color Wonder Fun Desk is another in a long list of great products. You can find other products similar to this at the Crayola web site.A very study and well-built desk is one plus that makes using this product very versatile. The desk is large enough to work on and small enough to fit anywhere. I found that the desk works best at the kitchen table.There are 2 coloring books included, 1 with pictures, which has a great number and variety to choose from. The second is completely blank, thus providing a platform for the child to become the next Picasso.The desk does travel very well and has a handy carry handle. There is also a clip on the desktop that holds the paper in place while the children draw. Overall this is one product that my kids really enjoy playing with."
2,"Good bargain, poor product","I bought these in Spring 2007 to protect my LifeDrive screen, and it does do that well. However the material is a little soft and mars easily. I found that with even moderate daily use I had to replace it every week - mostly due to the rough patch I'd carve over the lower-case alpha box! I wouldn't recommend these for organizer use, there are other products with much more durability and resiliency."
3,Great Detective Tale,"Only a truly great writer can spin a tale that, despite being written over 100 years ago is still entertaining and current. That is exactly what happens with this installment of the Charlie Chan mysteries. Equal to any modern detective story you actually need to remind yourself that this was written before the automobile was even commonplace. Entertaining, makes you think, and a good enjoyable read. Chan of course is a classic character and we see why in this book."
2,"Not my cup of tea, but it may be yours","_Twice Upon a Time_ is a glib, sarcastic take on fairy tales. Yes, a few of the retellings are serious, but most of them are attempts at poking fun at the conventions of fairy tales. I like these sorts of stories when they are well done, but most of these stories seem to be groaners rather than side-splitters; farces whose main purpose seems to be dragging every single fairy tale cliche into every single story. I mean, seriously, does a detective story about Rumpelstiltskin, which was just getting interesting, really need Hansel and Gretel barging into the plot? Many of the stories are like this. Just throw the ten or so most famous fairy tales into a blender and see what comes out, and top it off with a forced wittiness. If you're looking for cheesy fairy tale humor, check this out. Otherwise, look up Datlow and Windling."
5,Awesome book,"I would highly recommend this book to any adult reader, however I have no clue why it has ""reading level: 9-12"" on the information, because it definitely deals with some subject matter not suitable for those ages at all. This is a retelling, putting an often sarcastic but at the same time very adult spin on some old, beloved fairy tales. If you enjoy retold fairy tales, or simply finding out what happens after ""happily ever after"", or even just hearing the other guy's side, definitely check it out."
4,I liked it!,"The idea of this was fresh, taking well known fairy tales and rewriting them. I LOVED almost all of them, except there was an occasional one that I didn't like as much. Anyway, don't let that discourage you. BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,"Awesome, uplifting, inspiring","I love this music to relax, for meditation, for stillness, for reconnecting to source. Kirtana has a special gift for saying the most profound in the simplist and most beautiful way. Thank you for sharing your gift."
5,MUSIC THAT SPEAKS TO THE SOUL,"WORDS CAN NOT EXPRESS THE EMOTIONS THAT THIS CD INVOKED. BY THE TIME I GOT INTO SONG NUMBER 5, ""WHAT A BLESSED LIFE"",I WAS CRYING OUT LOUD WITH TEARS OF JOY. MY SPIRIT RECOGNIZED THE TRUTH IN THE LYRICS, THIS IS A TRULY EVOLVED PIECE OF WORK. FOR ANYONE WHO HAS WALKED THIS PATH, IT IS EVIDENT THAT WE ARE WALING IN THE FOOT STEPS OF KIRTANA OR VICE VERSA."
2,Video Now,"This Video Nov player looks cool but believe me, the picture is only in black and white. When you get it you are most likely going to return it. It does not even have a light. The screen is so small. I rather get Video Now: Color rather than this because that is in color!!!! It even has a backlight. This is not good at all!!! I would give this: 1.3 out of 10."
4,Video Now; Toy Of the Future,"I just bought my ten year old daughter a video now for the holidays. It was one of the biggest hits! We were going on a trip, and she used it for hours on the plane. Video Now is fairly durable, with good picture. The discs are fairly cheap, and they play her favorite t.v. shows. I highly reccomend this for children of many ages."
2,this thing sucks!,i think it sucks because all your doing is watching a movie on a little tiny screen.plus they dont have a variety of movies or shows to pick fromand its black & white.if you have the money go buy yoursels one of those car tvs instead of this peace of junk.
1,"well,","my cousin has this but i dont, and i have played with itbefore. its not that fun and the graphics arent the greatest.i think that this makes a lousy gify to anyone who has goodtaste and or good judgement and buyers remourse!!! sorry hasbrobut i dont like this and probably neither would the person u aregiving this to."
4,Illuminating,"Bought the book on a speculation and found that I could not put it down. The prose were a little wanting, as was the second plot line which takes place in contemporary times. However, the first plot line, more historical than not, of the Khazars and their kingdom opened up a new line of study and thought. The handling of the historical aspects was superb and illuminating while the modern story line was a little maudline. Strongly recommended for those interested in Jewish and steppe history."
3,More a disappointment than anything else...,"I read this book in French when it was first published in France. As somebody much interested in Khazar history I was disappointed as it seemed rather superficial so as to the historical content and the plot was not fascinating either when I expected the author to have written a better fiction book based on Khazar history when the latter is treated in some very few but good works... Moreover there is not even, at least in the French edition, the short bibliography Marek Halter should have included out of mere fairness: The one of the works whithout which he could not have written his own book!Anybody really interested in Khazar history should better read The Thirteenth Tribe andThe Jews of Khazaria... [...]"
3,Interesting about a little known subject,Having been Jewish all my life... a long time... I knew nothing about the Khazars. Very interesting subject. I wonder about the veracity of the tale although it was cleverly written with the shifts in time.
5,Book review,This book arrived in great shape and very quickly. I'd certainly buy from this seller again.
5,"Complete, thorough","As a Berklee Alumni, and a former student of Richard Davis I found this book to be vital to understanding certain ""unspoken subtleties"" of the film scoring world. A great book for those ibnexperienced in the field and for those who even have been around the block once or twice. Offers a great perspective on the workings of the craft of scoring."
5,Great book in affordable price!!!,There's a lot of information about film scoring. It's good and affordable price. It talks about history when the music involved in the film industry and tips and tricks if you want jump into this industry.
5,Great Book. Highly Recommended,"Very informative, and covers everything you need to know about working as a composer in a film industry"
5,"Great book, better Service!!","My book arrived in less than a week. It had all the appearances of being new! It was as good or better than the reviews said it would be. Thank you again, Amazon!"
4,"Great series, read them all.","I loved all three books. This one was great, I loved the Germanic village part. The ending was abrupt, in my opinion, but a great story over all."
5,Powerful and inspiring book!,"I wish I could give this book 6 stars! I didn't think it was possible, but this book is even better than the first. Some of the major themes of the book are forgiveness, repentance, self-sacrifice, and of course, love. The book picks up immediately where the last one left off and takes the reader through Marcus' spiritual journey and the obstacles and consequences Julia is forced to endure because of her bad choices. One of the messages in this book is God's faithfulness and His never-ending love for us even though we aren't worthy. The characters and plot are well written and well developed."
5,Totally in love with this book and this author,I have purchased so many copies of this series and given them away because my friends love it after reading it. I HIGHLY recommend. I finally purchased a digital copy so I will always have my own.
4,A story of redemption of the hardest hearts,"A very unexpected continuation of the first book, but with the same emotional feel and realism of the times and hearts of the characters. It has many new unexpected turns, with lots of suspense, but leaves you completely satisfied with how everything ties together in the end. This was better than the first book in the area of sensuality, as it was not completely focused on it, this time. In my view it was a more balanced look at life. I was a little disappointed with some characters left hanging at the end, but overall it was a well written story as part of a series."
4,A clean romance novel,"I have all three books. This is a continuation of book #2, following the lives of a couple of the characters from book #1 and introducing a few new ones. It ties in well to Roman history of that period and the reader learns some new vocabulary words from that era and locale. The plot was good. Sometimes a little too wordy, but it seems the author felt it necessary to get the whole message of salvation across. It's a clean romance novel from a christian perspective."
5,An Echo in the Darkness,This is another great book by a great man. Francine Rivers is one of the best writers that I have wanted more & more of her books
5,Awesome,"Francine Rivers bas created a beautiful series of historical fiction in the Mark of the Lion series. I love the history and Biblical history that is woven throughout these books. I feel like I am there, living in these times with these people. I also find interesting parallels to our society today. A must read series of Francine Rivers!"
4,"Nice Level, but be sure to calibrate it!","Really nice level with excellent accuracy.Please be aware that you should calibrate this unit prior to using it the first time (and after bumping or jolting it or after it has sat for long periods of time). I took my brand new level out to use it to level a window sill that I was framing. I finished framing the window sill and decided to double check it with my old 48"" level and it was off by over 3/8"". I double checked with another 24"" cheap level and it agreed with my 48"" regular level. I ran the calibration procedure and this level also showed the window sill off by 3/8"". I learned this lesson the hardway (i.e. by having to reframe the window sill), but I also learned that the calibration procedure was very quick to perform."
2,Sears has a better but indentical tool for $69,After I bought it I happened to be at Sears and saw the same tool for $69 and the Sear version of the tool incorporated 2 neat features1. Laser level - so that you could use it to draw a line2. Tripod mounting so that you could use it to set up level linesNeedless to say I wish I had seen the Sears unit first
4,welcome to the ARK,"I was very excited in reading this book. Witht eh adventure and page turning suspense, I couldn't put it down. With the constant threat of Turnbull and the vergrowing war outside, the kids must find a way to connect with each other. Althought their quest is postponed, they are able to get back on track. IN the future they meet up and are able to connect with each other once more. I'm not sure if there is a sequel to this book, but if there isn't then the ending is very anti-climactic."
4,Hard to put down.,This is an intellectually stimulating book it's a ficticious story about what could almost be viewed as real. The story tells about the power of the human brain and how consequences of an action can change the world. You have to read this book!!!!!!!!
3,Welcome to the Ark class review,"This book is a good book for someone that likes books about four kids that are reallysmart but are outcast in the society of one thing or the other. This book is weird because itseems like it is happening now, because we are having a war and terrorist attacks like thebook. If you like scifi you would like this book because some of theses kids have prettyweird gifts like connecting with trees, mountains, and animals. Another one of the kidscan talk to people through their mind and can feel what others are feeling. So if you likethose thing you would like this book."

3,Good but not great.,I read this book for a class and I didnt really get into it that well. It was on one subject then after you get what they are talking about they change it on you. If it didnt do that so much I maybe would have enjoyed it more. The story line was confusing to me too. It kind of threw you in the middle of things and let you go from there.
2,Welcome To The Ark Review,"I thought that this book was alright. I enjoyed the complexity of the characters and their relationships. I however, didn't think the story line was that great. It was strange and lacked any real depth. Most of the time I didn't quite understand what was going on or what the author was referencing."
1,Welcome to the Ark,"I had to read this book for school. I didn't like it. I believe this is a book that is in a way unrealistic. I don't believe in some of the things stated here. Such as, the genius child seminar, parents should be happy with their kids. 3 thumbs down."
3,For John Wetton/Asia Fans only,"This is an album of extremes, not from poor to excellent, but rather, from mediocre to stellar. Recorded shortly after he left Asia in the mid-80s, a fair amount of what's here is John Wetton's ""B"" material. Examples: ""Keep On Loving Yourself"", ""You Don't Have To Leave My Life."" On the other hand, there is vintage Wetton orchestral layering in ""Round in Circles"" and power ballads defined with ""Suzanne"" and ""Have You Seen Her Tonight?"" Compared to his later solo work, this album represents a turning point from leaving Asia and the pop-rock '80s and returning to his progressive roots."
4,Small compact and easily hidden.,Came with the adapter needed for older receivers. Long cable and small head made this an easy install in my car.
5,Kind of pricey but you need your antenna,My original antenna's cable got warn down by the door opening and closing. I have mounted this one above the rear hatch of my explore in hopes that it will receive less wear and tear. So far it is working great
4,Works Well,Works well. The attachment to the xm unit seems much more robust and less likely to strain the antenna wire (the original for mine split).
3,Signal in and out,"I've only used this a few times since I bought it. There seems to be a tendency to drop the signal on occasion. This could be due to several factors. One second I have a full signal and the next I might drop the signal completely. Could be due to obstructions. If it continues, I may make an adjustment. There are times it works great. Time will tell."
4,Worked well with my Roady 2,"It worked well, but my radio itself is giving up the ghost. The connection between the antenna and radio is a little bit tight but it does fit once you put the adapter on."
3,Too expensive,"My first antenna's flimsy cable broke. Surprised it lasted as long as it did. Watch out for ""lowest price"" of some sellers: when you add their 8-dollar shipping, you might as well buy direct from Amazon with super-saver shipping."
4,XM antenna --just as described,"This came quickly and works as it should. Brielf instructions would have been helpful, as I have an extra part that I don't know what to do with. Still, it works great, and I now get clear reception! Thanks!"
4,xm ant.,very small and very fine reception- i layed it across my dash board and it worked just fine. very strong magnet if you need it.
1,got a bad feeling about installation,"Sold a vehicle and didn't have an easy way of taking the XM radio antenna out before it went, so got this for the new van. I connected it to the cradle of my other XM setup an another vehicle just to do a quick check and got no reception. Maybe someone who installs these for a living will have some insight, but right now, it appears to be DOA."
2,There are better remotes,"I have several Sony products (TV, Stereo, VCR) and yes they all work wonderfully with this remote - didn't even have to program those devices. The problem I had was when I tried to program my DVD player. There were only codes for 10 other brands! I have 4 DVD players and this didn't work on any. I decided to upgrade an older memorex model with a new sony. Yes, it did work, but some of the functionality was quirky. If you press the DVD function button while the DVD is on... the remote will turn it off. So if you want to switch from the stereo or tv functions back to controlling the DVD, you'd better put your hand over the transmitter or it will shut off the DVD player while your watching it. Didn't even work with my genaric analog cable box."
2,Not glow in the dark keys.,"In february 28 I purchased this remote control,mainly for his feature that the keys glows in the dark.Well thats not true!In the add for this product clearly says that, even in the Sony""sWeb page also appear that information.I read 3 times the manual instruction booklet and...nothing about it.!What is this? It isa lie? or a last time chages in the specifications? I am verydissapointing."
4,Hold Me Tender,"This is a great video camera. My only complaint is the uncomfortable and awkward hand positioning when ""taping"" or even while taking still pictures. I end up having to use two hands (luckily I have an extra one) to steady the camera, especially while using the wide angle / telephoto feature. It is even difficult to press the ""record"" button to stop recording without a fair amount of movement."
3,"ok for outdoor use, poor indoor performance","If you want quality video, if you want to edit using a program other than the minimal one that comes with the camera, if you want to video indoors under normal indoor lighting, then this is not the camera for you. But, if most of your shooting will be done outdoors and you don't plan on doing any significant amount of editing then this is an easy camera to carry around and it does a pretty good job of point and shoot. By the way, the video files on the sd card can only be viewed by the included Panasonic software."
1,No support from Panasonic,I have one and Panasonic doesn't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests. The proprietary video format requires special handling in your PC and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips. Are they abandoning this product? Look on the Panasonic website and see for yourself.
3,Very nice comeback,"This album came out in 1986 after Harry took three years off to be with her ill lover, Chris Stien.The best thing about Debbie Harry, is that she is constantly changing and innovating. This album is quite a bit different than her work with Blondie. It is more melodic and has more musical textures. Some may complain that it is over produced.There are two fantastic songs, ""French Kissing"" and ""In Love With Love"". There are some fairly goods ones, too, like ""Rockbird"". The remaining songs are uniformly good, but nothing special. This was released in the days of LP's and is only 36 minutes long. It is close to a four star album, but doesn't quite have enough great songs."
3,Average Debbie outing,"Debbie Harry made an attempted comeback with this Seth Justman( J Giles Band) produced album. Released in late 1986- this album should have came out in 1982 when-that J Giles Band was hot( Centerfold era) . lots of horns, keyboards,uptown blues. Best known for the radio hit ""French Kissin) and a stripped down version of her dance hit ""In Love with Love"" - this album was another disappointment for Debbie- due to it's banal sales. Though Debbie did have another clever album jacket cover. Best tracks are the title track and ""I want You"" Geffen had higher expectations and dropped Debbie from it's label after this."
1,Really bad cd!,I didn't even listen to the whole thing. My wife turned off the music after the first three songs.
3,Not too bad,"I love Bob Dylan and I love reggae, and I love Bob Dylan covered by reggae bands. That being said this is only an ok album. The songs just do not have the true reggae feel to them. In fact they do not have the true Bob Dylan feel either. It is an ok album but only if you can get it for cheap ($5 or $6). If you are looking for a good Bob Dylan reggae CD then check out ""Is It Rolling Bob? A Reggae Tribute To Bob Dylan."""
4,Dylan reggae!,How can you go wrong with a tribute album of Dylan songs done by reggae artists......You can't. dylan fans will truely appreciate the reggae treatments of these well known songs and reggae fans will love the basic reggae beats put to great lyrics....INteresting stuff here that makes for great outdoor barbque music during mthe lazy nights of summer!
1,Raggae+Bob Dylan,"I love reggae and Bob Dylan, This song cd has no emotion and dosent capture Bob's rythm and spirit. I just bought the cd today but i bet that it'll sound good after I get drunk."
5,A First Rate Introduction to Fromm,"Rainer Funk brings together the most lucid and poignant passages from Fromms oeuvre. The chapters are concise and the ideas are cogently presented. In Fromm's humanistic writings and critiques one, of course, finds references to Marx and Freud. However, one can equally recognize the insights of Heidegger, Nietzsche and even the mystic traditions of Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism and Christianity. Fromm's insights on capitalism and the 'having' mode of being are incredibly insightful and should offer the reader a great deal of reflection, especially in context with today's consumerism. Yet, in contrast, Fromm offers suggestions to free oneself from the limited and pernicious sensibilities of materialism and pecuniary greed. This collection will be an excellent complement to Marx, Veblen and Marcuse, and an indispensible introduction to Fromm and the Frankfurt school."
1,Not as advertised,"Without a powere cable, you can not fully perform to all standards. Cable was implied, but not received. They have very poor customer service (by email only), and I eventually received a notice from them that ""a cable is not provided with the product""; not even a suggestion as to where to obtain the power cable! You might want to investigate the ZUN2200 by Zonet if two ports are acceptable for your use."
1,"Bad Design, and Wrong spec, Stay away from it, Please.","I went to the company's web site, reviewed their specs carefully, unfortunately did not read all available reviews before making the order.Now, if the card actually works or not, I don't know. It would not even fit - go all the way in. The port at the and of the card stops the card from being fully inserted. It sticks out about an 8th or 16th of an inch from being all the way in in my Toshiba Tecra 9100.I was blinded by the price and bought something made from a company I've never heard about, a product that doesn't even comply to the product specification, waited a weak to get it, and now I'm looking for another one because I'm returning this one.Stay away from it. Please."
4,The Twilight of the Three-Martini Lunch,"Friedrich was one of the top editors of the original Saturday Evening Post for about 10 years until its demise in the late '60s. The book is a description of all of the mis-steps that led to the collapse of the Post. It's also, inadvertently, about the change in American business that took place at that time when conglomerates were devouring (and later, evacuating) old-economy warhouses like Curtis Publishing (the publisher of the Post). It's a sad book with an elegiac quality--particularly moving are the last chapters when everyone sees the disaster coming but can't stop it. Friedrich clearly loved the Post and it shows in this wise book. The writing is fresh and clean as one would expect.I would highly recommend perusing a few of his other works (particularly: the End of the World, the City of Nets and his history of Weimar, Germany during the '20s and the Von Moltke family). Friedrich is not one of the greats, but he is clearly a first-rate talent."
1,Disaster,"I bought this mask believing the three stellar reviews contrasted with the one unfavorable review. Mistake. I had the same experience as the previous reviewer who found that it leaked. Mine leaked in exactly the same place, which is like saying Niagra Falls is a little drippy. The mask filled instantly with water no matter how I placed it on my face, or how tightly. I never had problems with masks before, so this one stunned me. I should have tested it fully when it first arrived. I tried on a recent trip and it was unusable but my ""return window has expired."" Ooops."
1,"Reissue, not remaster","Not sure why the page says that this is a remaster, the CD sounds exactly like the original CD from 1988, so as far as I can tell it is only a reissue. So if you have the 1988 CD, save yourself some money.This is also why I gave it only 1 star, the music deserves more."
5,ONE OF THE BEST ALMOND'S ALBUM,This album go out in the middle 80's and at last is available in CD. You can't let it go.
2,"Unlike Fine Wine, ""Stars We Are"" Has NOT Aged Well!",I bought this album because I love:A) Soft CellB) Marc Almond's LyricsC) Marc Almond's Vocals/Quirkyness/PersonalityLet met just say that this album does NOT live up to anything Marc did with Soft Cell. The songs are rather interesting and definately don't stagnate...but they're just not any good! This album is tainted by the late 80s sound (which we all have grown to hate).
5,The audio version helps to instill the ideas during commutes,"In this day and age where time is limited and often wasted on long commutes, I find audio books to be very helpful.After having converted this to audio files myself, it was possible for me to listen to it over and over again during commutes. This, I find, to be very helpful to impart the suggestions in my mind. Even though there are small parts where the author states his opinion, this does not distract from the main messages and their practical benefits.This book builds on my understanding and the proven works of Edgar Cayce, Louise Hay, and other spiritual teachers, that I cannot recommend it enough.Get it and listen to it. Play it back during drives with someone you wish to share this knowledge to.It will change the life of those who really try to understand and put the information into practice."
3,"Algo ""light"" (liviano).","El libro en si es muy sencillo en lo que se refiere a tocar cada uno de los temas de que trata. Lo recomiendo si lo que se espera es una lectura ""fácil"", nada de complicaciones filosóficas o psicológicas. Es bueno en una clasificación general."
4,inspirational,"The book itself is trivial with regard to language and overall vision, but the author brings to light everyday values and concepts that we already know and often forget to practice. This book is a great reminder of these values and the power of awareness. At a time of depression in my life, I read this book from cover to cover in a matter of hours and found the inspiration to overcome my fears and faults. Of course it wasn't a quick fix, but it reminded me of my inner strength, something I had forgotten throughout the trials of my everyday life. Now, I read this book about once a year to remind myself that I'm not perfect-but then no one else is either. All in all, life is pretty wonderful when you allow yourself to focus on the positive."
1,"Way too many ""God"" references","This book didn't work for me at all. I LOVE his positive thinking book, but I only made it through about 1/3 of this book. If your personal beliefs are different to his, than this book will not help you, it will irritate you."
2,Not what I was hoping for!,"This book is full of platitudes with no practical steps to acheive ""self-confidence."" I kept waiting for something helpful to come along, and it did not. There were a few nice sentences I marked, but all in all this book is not very practical. Some of the views are very biased. Also, the author goes off on unrelated tangents that I wish I could have skipped over. I'm not hard to please...but this book displeased me."
1,No new ideas,"Maybe I am naive, but I think if a book promises total self-confidence, it ought to deliver. This book does not deliver.I admit, any book making these kind of claims would have a tough time delivering on them, but the main reason I am disappointed is that the ideas espoused in this book are hardly original. Instead, his ideas range from cliche' statements lifted straight from Dale Carnegie (""be a good listener"", ""let the other guy know you are impressed with him"") to the purely metaphysical, such as ""whatever the human mind can conceive, it can acheive"" (now, pardon me for just a second while I use my mind power to get out of this wheelchair).For somebody with absolutely no self-confidence, these tips are good to start out with, but for most people they will simply be common sense. A reader should expect a lot more from someone who has a Ph.D. in the subject."
1,Pseudo Science Masquerading as Truth,"I was deeply offended by this book's continual references to a ""superconsciousness"" tied to a Christian God that will guide one's ""intuition."" Another reference suggested that thought waves can control metal atoms. Perhaps, the book has been revised since the 1984 version I read, but the version I read pushed Christianity."
2,You have heard them all before,"I have to admit in public, that I was naive enough to buy this book. Of course there are no secrets in this book; it is just a commercial finesse to make you wanting to read it. Robert Anthony repeats things, that have already been written before. Furthermore, he tends to repeat himself, so you end up being quite tirred of meeting the same phrases over and over again, and this gives you a feeling, that you achieve nothing from this publication. However, this is not the whole truth, cause Anthony provides some originallity and puts some situations into a new light, which is good for your inspiration. But, as I said, no secrets in here. Therefore, I reveal this secret: Never buy anything, just because it claims to reveal any secrets or claims to contain something that you just have to know. With your specific needs, go after specific books, or you will just perpetually hear the same things."
2,Not what I wanted,"I got this book because when faced with a new situation or task my first response is often ""I can't do that."" I was looking for somthing to help me know that I CAN (because I can).So far, this book isn't it. I'm only halfway through and probably won't finish, because I'm not finding what I need here.If I needed to know about different kinds of guilt, or about love, or if I needed to know about the ""sexist attitude of society"" that has ""placed labels on women which must be overcome if a woman is to be treated as a person and not a sex object"", or ""If a young woman has poor self-esteen, she will often marry the first man who comes along"" this book would be great. But as far as helping me to be a more confident person, not great."
5,Excellent book,"This book provides enlightenment and awareness of Self. I attribute its influence for giving me permission to be who I am, and for helping me to increase my knowledge and appreciation of myself, and for showing me the path to becoming a better person. The concepts offered are clear and easy to understand. I've read it multiple times, and still find myself skimming it from time to time after 10 years."
1,Hard to believe,"I read this book after picking it up in the gift shop in the Mudd Home in Bryantown. For years, I wanted to believe Mudd was an innocent dupe just living up to his hypocratic oath. But the more I've read over the years, the less plausible it is to believe that Mudd did not know the man he was helping and housing. I DO believe Mudd's wife had no idea, but Mudd had to know based on previous meetings and conversations that night, not to mention Booth's initials were in the boot Mudd cut off that night.For a biography about the man, this is a fine retelling, and helps satisfy any curiosity one might have about what happened to Mudd after he returned from prison. I disagree that the book is all lies, but find it is more a narrative about the information the decendants of this man have passed down for 6 or 7 generations, hoping to protect the legacy of a man who's beliefs mirrored those of half the country at the time."
1,This book is nonsense,"This alleged memoir has been repeatedly exposed as a fabrication by genuine Special Ops veterans' groups and the U.S. Naval Institute's PROCEEDINGS. Mr.Smith was apparently a real Naval officer during the Vietnam War, but his Southeast Asian service was limited to the Philippines. During the period of the novel, he was actually serving as Treasurer of the Officers' Club at Sangley Point Naval Air Station, PI. However, I am sure people who wish to believe these things will find his account insightful, along with other such ""true"" war stories like ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""La Femme Nikita""."
1,This book is absurd!!,"Having served in the CIA as well as the military I can't believe anyone would take this book serously. Smith never offers any real proof that his story is truth rather than fiction. He can't even prove that he was ever in the Navy. Save your money, this guy is a phoney!!"
1,Walter Mitty goes to Southeast Asia.,"In a nutshell, don't waste your time. Having been too young toserve in Vietnam, I am unable to critique this from the perspective ofan expert, but I was suspicious from the start. My gut feeling was that this book was largely, if not entirely, contrived. I found it too detailed in ways that simply added verbage to the text; yet scant in necessary detail, elsewhere. File under fiction."
2,Good reading but probably more fiction than truth,"Having spent 492 days in S.E. Asia including 13 reconnaissance missions into Laos and Cambodia out of N.K.P. in Thailand, I was very intrested in this book, but found it very hard to take seriously. Our hero single handedly survives these missions without anyone left to confirm his story. The United States Never successfully rescued ANY Americans from POW camps in S.E. Asia. There were some South Vietnamese soldiers rescued but not any Americans. Not cause we didn't try, but we never got there before they were moved to new camps. Don't get me wrong we did do black ops. reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, I just find it too difficult to believe that Warner Smith was there except in his very good imagination. He tells a good story but should call it what it is FICTION. :("
1,Walter Mitty goes to SE Asia.,"This is the fourth time I have written a review; let's see if it gets included this time. In short: Don't waste your time reading this book. If the author was in Vietnam, it was either in a unit other than the one of which he claimed to be a member; or it was all in his imagination. He describes in finite detail unimportant items, while being general and vague in areas of importance. As other reviewers have written, the author makes well nighe impossible to verify the details. Well-fabricated, but probably a product of an over-active imagination, rather than real experience."
2,Reasonably engaging story that is probably fiction,"The author purports to be recruited and trained by the CIA for top secret missions in Southeast Asia and Southern China. A good story that starts to suffer when one realizes it does not hang together. All links to possible verification lead to dead ends. For example, there are 16 men in his group. The other 15 are killed. All his missions have no connection with others and have no organizational relationships. The off hand way he severes his relationship with the CIA without debriefing nor formality is a very unsatisfying ending that creates more suspicions. All in all, there is a whiff of shallowness that detracts from the story."
5,great relief,Biofreze is great for those minor aches and pains that come from working construction. I first got it from my back specialist and have been using it when needed for 4 years.
5,Completely Satisfied,"I purchased Biofreeze in Tube, Pump and Roll on for travel..it seems to help relieve pain in my knees.."
5,Biofreeze,Great product for sore limbs I am very active and apply this a few hours before and after any race it works great...
5,Biofreeze works!,"I am a physician and recently had shoulder surgery. As I went through some painful physical therapy to rehab my shoulder, my therapist gave me a tube of biofreeze to use. I was amazed at the instant relief it gives. Even though the relief wears off, I could reapply the gel frequently. As a result, I was able to fully exercise my shoulder with much less pain and, I believe, recover much more quickly from my surgery. I am going to recommend biofreeze to many of my patients with acute and chronic pain conditions in the future. Compared to over the counter rubs, this stuff is the best!"
5,Biofreeze--It's great,I love this product. I would highly recoommend it to anyone. It feels cool when on.
4,Great product,"This product works great for relieving back pain, especially at work or if you don't want to take medicine. It is a little messy and difficult to put on because it is a gel not cream. Otherwise, great product."
5,BioFreeze,"I had severe shoulder pain and tried all of the heat and cold products out there. Then I came across some sample packets of BioFreeze Gel that I had received at a health fair. I used the BioFreeze on my shoulder and it worked great at relieving the pain. I tried to find it in a local drug store, and found that it is not sold in drug stores. I was told I had to purchase it from a therapist or other medical professional. After doing some research online, I found it on Amazon.com, and at a better price than other sites. I have since been going to a therapist for the shoulder, and they agree that BioFreeze is the ointment to use. They have a huge pump bottle of it in the therapy clinic. I highly recommend this product for pain relief of sore muscles or bursitis."
1,"Surprise, the active ingredient is 3.5% MENTHOL...","and if I had known that, I wouldn't have wasted my money. You can buy similar menthol products at any drugstore and save a lot of money on shipping. As advertised, the scent does not linger like other menthol products. If that's important to you, go for it! Just don't expect long-lasting pain relief because you'll be ""sorely"" disappointed, just like I was."
4,Biofreeze Pain Relieving Gel,"Biofreeze is a great product. Helps relieve my pain and inflammation on my back. However, don't buy from hpms.com. They are a bunch of crooks. They promised to send 6 travel packets of Biofreeze if you leave a positive feedback for them and guess what, they sent you only 3. When I contacted them, no replies whatsoever. Buy from other suppliers on Amazon, stay away from HPMS !"
4,Lasts a long time,"I bought this CD player off Amazon YEARS ago, one for me and one for my husband's car. Over 6 years later both of them still work perfectly. I never would have imagined the wonderful quality at such an affordable price (I think I paid 60 bucks each). These machines have been in intolerable heat and ice cold conditions, since we leave them in the cars constantly. I'm amazed there are still companies out there that make quality items, since it seems there is so much junk out there now.When the day comes to replace them, I'll go with Sony again."
2,not what expected,"I was looking for a yoga routine for my husband and myself to do together, like one that you would do if you were to take a class, so we got this dvd, but there was too much talking in the begining and soft porn type of sections where the people are doing their yoga without clothing. It just was not the type of yoga routine that we were looking for, we really were hoping for a boding routine that went smothing from one postion to the next not one that talked and they just showed the position without explaining how to get into that position. Could work for some but jsut not our style"
2,Bad purchase.,"I was truly, truly disappointed with my purchase of this dvd. The idea behind the dvd is great, but the actual content was not so great. My main problem with the dvd was that it flew through the positions so fast that you could not keep up with it. I was hoping this would be relaxing and sensual for my partner and me, but it ended up being stressful because we were just trying to keep up with the moves. It might work if you are looking for some positions, but do not need step by step guidance. However, this dvd is not appropriate for those who need more direct and clear guidance through the positions."
4,A great way to get closer to your intimate partner,"The video is good, but not until the end do you actually get to the practicing. If you have done a lot of yoga already, only the last part of this video will be good for you. Though, the beginning was a good review for the avid Yoga enthusiast."
4,Meh.,"This isn't a ""Moral Lesson"" Berenstain Bears book, it's an early reader.As you might expect, Papa Bear does everything wrong, and the kids find the pumpkin thief. It's a pretty light read even for a beginning reader - some of the rhymes are a bit forced, and Papa's wrongheadedness is a little overexaggerated - attacking chickens?But the kids like it, and it is simple for a beginning reader, and that's the important thing."
4,The Bear Detectives,"In this book, the bears are looking for Farmer Ben's missing pumpkin. Papa Bear is also coming along to help, but he becomes more of a hazard. They look all over, following the clues they pick up, and the ones their dog Snuff does. And they finally find out who it is, it was Farmer Ben's wife. She made the pumpkin into pie. As they are looking for these clues, they are having fun. I liked this book as a child because it was a mystery, and I had to try to figure out who too the pumpkin."
2,funny,"i guess you gotta be a fan of the berenstein bears in order to kinda enjoy this book, or else maybe u just have a different sense of humor, or maybe u jsut like mysteries like this one. this book is also a ryming book, which can make it more interseting, and it is pretty funny, which will make it fun for the kids to read"
3,A first mystery book...,"This is a nice book for young readers which follows the Berenstain Bears through the innocent story of searching for a missing prize pumpking. The story is in rhyme and is a funny little mystery for a small child, which also like several Berenstain Beginner Books strains the importance of reading and learning, as the kids follow the rules of their detective manual. However, just like in other Berenstain books, they undermine the parental figure, cause the dad is not very smart and keeps making mistakes, which is why I didn't give it a higher rating, as I think that it's ok to make parents appear human and not perfect, but it's another thing to make them appear totally useless."
3,Minty taste overpowers licorice,"I was excited to try this product as I love black licorice, mint and herbs. When I opened the package, there was a pleasant aroma, so I was really excited to bite into a piece. Once I did, I was surprised at the overpowering minty taste. I recommend just buying a single box somewhere before buying a large quantity. The regular Panda All-Natural Black Licorice product is much better, and I recommend them highly."
2,Too herbacious,"The taste of peppermint and thyme overwhelmed the taste of licorice, leaving one with the taste of medicine rather than candy. It shouldn't be called licorice at all. It has a soft feel to it, but without a good taste it is just a waste. Go for Panda's licorice, but not this one. Unless you like the taste of thyme and peppers in your candy"
1,blek,I love Panda regular black licorice but grabbed this one by mistake at the grocery store. Blek...I had to throw the box away after managing to eat half. Licorice has a strong flavor but the herbs in this formula make you forget there's any licorice in it.
1,Not for all Licorice Lovers,"I have been a licorice lover most of my life, but combining a mint flavor with licorice does not work for me. I have a case of this stuff I have to eat..."
5,quite good!,yum!for all those fans of black liq.yuck!for all those tasteless fools who hate black liq.that about sums it.
2,Return To Zero Indeed,"A good recorded album, but the song writing lacks. I guess if you are a Boston fan then go ahead and buy this album. There is one song on that album written by Maez(The keyboardist) which is a 5 out of 5 stars ballad. It's was their debut single release called ""Untill Your Love Comes Back Around."" It's one of my favorite power ballad of all time. Brad's voice soars on that song like no other song on that album. I have emailed the keyboardist and wondered why that song never became big? To this day it still escapes me when I listen to that songmhow the record company did not push that song. I still believe that song is good enough to be re-produced. It's a timeless piece."
5,Incredible!,"Y'know, I've never been a big Pop music fan, but Tony Banks is one exception. I like the rhythm, the odd time signatures, and just about everything else. But HOLY HAVE SOME SINGERS BATMAN!!! Tony used five singers on this album, my favorites being Fish (vocals sound like a cross between Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins) and Jayney Klimek (whatever happened to her anyway?), for Tony captured the strong points of both singers in the few tracks they sang vocals for. This CD has a variety of different types of tracks for the entertained listener, with several pop songs (Red Day on Blue Street, Hero for an Hour), a killer Piano Ballad (Still it Takes Me By Surprise), and you can't have a Tony Banks CD without at least one Genesis-esk song (Another Murder of a Day). So eat it up, 'cause this is the best album to start a new Tony Banks fan."
3,Worth Considering,"Tony Banks has a mess of singers on this album: one of my favorites is Nik Kershaw singing ""I Wanna Change The Score"" and the other less popular singers (I've never heard of) come around nicely with a few cool, up-beat songs: The Gift & Back To Back...A few one-hit wonders to consider on this album."
2,Still?,"While I'm happy to see Tony Banks get some recogntion for his brilliance as a composer I have to say I'm surprised at the high marks people give Still--to me, his worst album.I should explain that I cannot tollerate Fish (that voice makes me think of the nauseating Warm Wet Circles) but even so, the songs on Still are jut not a league with The Fugitive and A Curious Feeling is just in a different class, period."
4,Actually really good @}->---,"After hearing Do It To It a few months back, I thought these guys might be a one hit wonder, but you know what? These girls can sang. This cd has some really good tracks on it. They have excellent harmonies and the music is great. Sometimes the songs aren't lyrically all that, but overall, they've done an excellent job and I really like this.Do It To It is a great song although I'm a little tired of it now that it's gotten so much airplay, but the other good songs here are Stop Calling Me, That Boi and the slow funky ballad Whenever. I think Cherish have done great and there will be another couple of singles yet to come from this group."
4,This Just Sucks,"I thought this album was going to be so great, but after listening to it their vocals are weak, the songs are shabby, and I want my money back for this album. There are no real girl groups out because it's hard to follow the legacy of those before, and this abomination is exactly why. They are unappreciated for a reason and will remain so if they don't come better than this. Try again girls!!!!!Edit: December 31, 2010This and the album after this is great! I listened to this album once and left it alone for a few years, then I ended up hearing it again and loved it!! I am super happy with this group and sure hope they release more like this!!"
1,Just another group of Destiny's Child wanna-bes,"I don't know what it is, but this group just isn't anything special at all. Looking at them from all perspectives, I get this: 1) They don't write their own lyrics. Even if they did, well, they're all stupid anyways. 2) There are no instruments involved in this CD. The entire music scheme is completely computer-generated. 3) When I first heard ""Do It To It"" on the radio, I thought that it was a Rihanna song. I mean, the voices are completely identical. This shows that their really nothing different from any other R&B singer or group ""on the market"" today. I mean, I can sing better than they do. And I'm only 14 years old. If you ask me, I say just don't buy it. It's not worth it. You're hust gonna want to give it back to the store."
1,IMPORT TAX,BRISTISH CUSTOMERS AND EXCUSE HAVE RETAINED MY CDS SUBJECT TO IMPORT CHARGE - I WILL NEVER BE USING THIS SITE AGAIN
2,"I'll Tell You Why Cherish Is ""Unappreciated""","I'm not feeling this CD at all. The only tracks that stand out are ""Do It To It"" and ""Unappreciated,"" which are already being played on the radio. Everything else is watered R&B/Pop filler. These girls are pretty, but I don't see anything unique about their sound that makes them stand out. Basically, they lack flavor or personality. Their ages range from 18-22 and the entire subject matter is about relationships and it doesn't make sense. There should be more going on in a young woman's life instead of dealing with fools. Why not have songs about having a dream, being sisters, learning from mistakes, etc? And if you're going to sing mostly about love, at least get a BETTER song writer who could write melodies and meaningful lyrics to make a song HOT or CLASSIC. You know what I'm saying? Cause like I said before, these songs are forgettable, they go through one ear and out the other. Skip this and get ""Sisters With Voices."""
4,I bought this cd for my wife and she LOVES it!,"this is a great cd, my wife loves it! especially her two hits ""Treat me like a chevy"" and ""Do it"".. You really should purchase this cd."
4,Better Than Expected,"Pretty good debut. Nice vocals, meaningful lyrics although, I am typically sick of sex oriented songs. It seems that this generation has a one track mind without any reference to intimacy just how they can hit. This one does have a little more substance than most solo, or groups this age. I amimpressed, probably more like 3.5 stars but I will upgrade them to 4."
4,quite suprised,"I like many other people that bought this album were expecting a bunch of SNAP music. i like the song ""do it to it"" dont get me wrong but i thought this album would be a CD full of songs just like that but suprisingly there are some songs on there that will appeal to grown folks as well. let me say that after a single that did not get much air time(miss p) and a shelved album in 2003 i didnt think wed ever see these girls again but they found their luck with jazzy pha. they have the style of girls their age but @ the same time they have the sophistication to draw attention from the more mature crowd.younger crowd-----------------that boiDO IT TO ITchevytakenchick like meolder crowd----------fool for youunappreaciatedstop calling meoohshow and tellmoment in time(love this track, their vocals sound soo good together)whenever(another one of my favorites on the album.. makes you feel like u back in the 90s listeing to a TLC album)"
3,a little below average,"This talented group unfortunately loses their identity to the trends, leaving an average album with laid-back vocals and repetitive hooks."
3,Unappreciated?,I'm not going to act like this was the best cd I ever heard but I will give some props. It was decent. The songs were commercial and pop-ish.They aren't all that memorable but some of them have catchy hooks.Thus I give it a 3. It was nothing spectacular but they cd can be listened to cover to cover which is a feat in itself. I recommend moment in time as my favorite.
3,Quite Pleased,"When I heard their first single ""Do It To It"" I thought to myself that they were gonna be a one hit wonder. But it was after I heard the second single I went out and bought the album. I was quite impressed with the songs, despite the fact that I only hear one person. I like numbers 1,3,4,6 and 7. They all have their own groove to them."
1,misleading description,"Amazon is selling this product as a new original and genuine DVD, which is not. This is a frudulent DVD produced by a company that copies and sells pirated merchandise. I'm amazed that Amazon is selling this product. Not only the copy is illegal, but it's also incredibly bad. I haven't checked my card statement yet, but I hoped that they returned my money after I sent the DVD back. Shame on you Amazon!"
3,fastestmanalive,"If you've ever read the Electric Kool Aid Acid Test then it would be hard for you not to remember the fastestmanalive. He was a wildman that crossed from the Beat generation (he was Moriarity in Kerouac's On the Road) to the first inklings of the hippie generation. He also died before his time. Maybe he lived longer than anyone thought. This book was fun. Most of the characters from this period crack me up. However, sometimes this read like a fan book. Although I don't know why he needs fans. But if you are interested in the 60s (yeah!) then this is one more thing that you will get a nostalgic kick out of."
4,Pretty cool!,This firesteel is pretty awesome! i got one for my dad and my brother for their Christmas stockings and they seemed to really like them! i was definitely entertained watching them spark up a storm!
4,"Gary - Swedish Fire Steel, Army Model","The Swedish FireSteel Army Model is a substantial hunk of flint. At approx 3/8"" diameter and 2-1/2"" length it should last for many years of repeated use. I tested this flint against 2 others I have: a combo flint/magnesium, and a survival mini-flint inlaid in a whistle. Quite honestly, all three worked about the same in a garage test using a cotton ball as my fire starter, but the mini-flint shows immediate signs of abrasion. The fire starter material (tinder) is the key element. If you have a good fire starter tinder, it doesn't take much of a spark to ignite it.I was not impressed with the included striker; I got better spark using a knife blade.FYI: the FireSteel Army Model Flint has a black surface coating that has to scraped off before the flint is functional.In summary, I would definitely recommend the Swedish FireSteel Army Model, but it may be overkill depending upon your needs."
4,Nice product,"Excellent little firesteel. The motion needed to create good sparks is akin to striking a match. Hold it between thumb and index finger and run it down the steel with a quick flick of the wrist. Do it close to your dry leaves, nest, pine needles, paper or whatever you have you want to ignite. Quickly produce sparks into the dry material. You'll have a fire started in no time."
5,It works,I have started a few fires over the years with this and it still has a long life to go. More or less I carry it as a back up to matches or a zippo.
5,Works as intended.,Once you get the black layer off of it - works great. Started a small fire with it on my grill with some dryer lint. I am going to order another one.
5,Light my fire,This is an outstanding fire starter for the money. Made very well. Produces huge spark. Add some tinder with this starter and you'll never be without a fire.Jon
5,"I'm a fire-starter, terrific fire-starter...","Yup. It's a terrific firestarter.Works easily every time it's used thus far. A small, much appreciated gift from a friend."
5,EXCELLENT FIRE STARTER,"Very nice look. Good quality and finish. Very bright spark. Works well in all conditions. Excellent tool for camping, survival or outdoor adventure.Buy it."
5,Works well and is great for emergencies!,This item was exactly what I expected and I'm very happy with it. It works well and is great in emergency situations where dry matches or typical fire-starting materials aren't available.
5,Quality,No it not the least expensive unit out their but 339 reviewers before me can tell you it a quality built tool. One youy'll want for you survival or camping gear. I plan on buying a few more.
5,Does what it says...really cool,"Apparently this is cooler than I realized as there have been so many people that I expected would have heard about this before that hadn't and are really impressed with it. Simple, reliable, a must have back-up system :-)"
5,Great Product!,"This is a MUST BUY for any survivalist or outdoors lover or you just like to go camping this little number will get your fire going no matter what the weather hot, cold, rain, or snow! this product is high quality and heavy duty and works exactly as advertised and using my hunting blade I was able to get an even better spark though the striker works fine and there is no need to use the knife at all the company shipped this item very quickly it was not supposed to be delivered until the 5th of July and it got here today on the 3rd of july now that is FAST shipping! If you are trying to decide which one to buy stop right here and buy this NOW! you will not regret it!"
4,Good Product,Seems to do what it is supposed to and that's help start a fire. Good quality unlike the cheaper versions out there
2,There is spark but no flame,"I was excited to use this. I saw the guy on Man vs Wild use it and say he never went anywhere with out one. Well, I got plenty of spark but it took FOREVER for anything to catch flame. I actually had to pour gasoline on the branches, then light it up! POOF! That worked. So, yeah, not all that excited about this item anymore. :P"
1,Not dependable,"This product should not be depended on. I tried lighting several things for several hours today. The only thing that lit was dryer lint. If you are in an emergency situation, you better have something better than this. I will try a different fire starter soon. This product is junk. If sparks and the shavings spark so it looks cool, but nothing actually catches. Really disappointed."
2,false advertise,"the fire steel was shown as a ""light my fire"" brand fire steel.once i got it it had no marks of brand and did not give good sparks."
2,Underwhelmed. How is this design an improvement?,"The photos make this firesteel look like you can use the strike tool while it is attached to the lanyard. The lanyard holds both the striker and the sparker. The lanyard is way too short to allow enough movement to strike against the sparker. I had to remove the striker from the lanyard (the lanyard is not meant to be taken apart). The striker has special cuts in it to supposedly aid with sparking. Nope. Doesn't work. If I reversed the striker and used the handle side I got spark. Hardly any spark using the ""correct"" side. The sparker is covered with a paint coating that must be removed before it can be used. This is not a good fire tool. Stick with the cheaper bar design."
2,doesn't seem to work,"i bought a swedish fire steel army model and doesn't seem to work. i tried mayadust, paper, soft paper and nothing so far. besides, the metal thing attached is not gonna do it as string is too short. i used a knife. it does sparks a lot though."
2,sparks aren't as hot as you'd think,"While kind of fun to play with (it does make a lot of sparks per strike). I found this to be a rather lame fire starter tool. While it says the sparks are several thousand degrees, I found it rather difficult (but possible) to light ideal materials like a piece of klenex and my gas stove top. Both took many tries.Lighting a plain piece of paper? I can't even scorch it. Good luck starting a fire with this thing out in the open with damp material."
1,Lame,"This thing doesn't work nearly as well as the reviews say. Although it sparks very easily, it doesn't light anything. I tried it right in the middle of a loose clump of dead grass and the most I got were a few embers about five minutes into repeatedly striking it. Soon after I tried sprinkling a little bit of lighter fluid around, but to no avail."
5,excellent fire steel,This is a quality fire steel and produces great spark. Easy to carry. High quality thumb grip and lanyard. Save your dryer lint to get a good fire started.
5,Whats not to like... =),"This is how its suppose to be done, and light my fire has the right idea , I couldn't wait to get this fire steel, I have the scout model and it works great just wanted something with some more thickness to it, I can start a fire in a pinch with this monster!!"
4,Performs as advertised.,"Added this to my emergency bag. Really makes a good amount of sparks, seems like a great product."
4,Slick little tool,"Not an easy feat to start a fire with flint, but it works as advertised. I did find that the included striker doesnt work as well as a knife."
3,The Good and the Bad,"The first time I used this product it worked as advertised.The second time, while sparking, the item came apart. It sliped out of the tan handle(knob remained in my hand) I searched in the dark umg. Found it and started my fire. Could have been ugly. Will try to glue back into handle because its hard to hold onto without it."
5,"Works great, survived rain and all temperatures for months","I have used this item hundreds of times. It works really well for lighting stoves. It usually takes about 4 strikes to light a stove with this device. It is FAR better than using a lighter or matches because of how far away I can get while lighting. You have to be pretty close to light fires. It has worked well for me doing that, but I expect a lighter might work a little better because of the continued flame.This firesteel is small and after hundreds of uses, appears to have thousands more remaining (I am about 20% of the way through the bar).I love this firesteel and came back to this page to buy a backup in case I lose the one I'm currently using. I am sorry if I sound like an advertisement, but I usually don't review anything unless it's really good or really bad. This one is really good.-Dave"
4,Even dryer lint has a use,"This will definitely start a fire and that is what it is meant to do. I had trouble getting it to work using the attached metal striker (that just came in handy to scrape off the paint), but I used an old serrated steak knife (the kind that does happen to be in our traveling/emergency kit anyway) and I got a fire going very quickly. Using lint from the dryer works very well. I keep a tin filled with lint and a little shredded toilet paper for use as fire starter.Another reviewer put it wisely when he said that one does have to know how to prepare and start a fire -- it really isn't a magic wand. With a little knowledge (and plenty of sensible care please!) this device works."
4,"Fun, but don't throw away your matches","Another reviewer mentioned cotton balls. I highly recommend carrying some with you if you plan to use this as your primary fire source. As far as spark creation goes, I found a cheap, slightly serrated knife to work better than the attached piece of metal."
5,Works like a charm.,"Have tried many of the starters out there,this one has not failed me.Wet,dry,or anything it will start a fire. Easy to pack and use."
5,fire stix,"great product, lights tender when damp or very windy, a must have for the serious outdoors person . very easy to use , even in the dark . i will be buying more of these . . ."
4,Good firesteel,"I bought this to replace a typical magnesium block with a ferro rod attached device. I never used the magnesium on my old one and the rod was small and didn't throw a lot of sparks. This one throws easily 5 times the sparks per strike. I expect this to serve me for many years. Only downside, it is large. But i wanted one with a longer life so it was a good tradeoff.For those who can't get this to light a fire... you probably are not using adequite tinder. If i can't find good natural tinder, I use the stuff I brought from home: cotton balls that are coated in petroleum jelly. One of these little guys burns for about 3 minutes and should light even damp wood. Read more about these and other good survival tips in Cody Lundin's book 98.6 Degrees."
5,Best flint yet,"I have used other brands and other types of flint/strikers before. And this flint is awesome! It comes with a black paint-job on the flint part, but that won't hold you back at all. This flint is THICK too. Most other flints I've had were half this one's diameter.. I started a few fires with some Jute twine that I shredded up, and ONE flick off this thing. Looks like I'll have enough flint for quite some time now. It is very ""beefy"", yet not heavy or anything. I'd suggest tying about 6-8 feet of Jute onto it, using a ""cobra"" knot system, and you have yourself an awesome firestarting kit. --Very nice!"
5,A must have for camping or survival!,"This firesteel set is superb, it will light in almost any condition in which you can procure some sort of dry tender. I suggest this to any camping/survival enthusiasts!"
5,GREAT!!!!!,"This is a great piece of equipment!!! I was very surprised by the weight of this item (which is a good thing),it makes a shower of sparks, and has a very long lanyard which doesnt get in the way if used properly. Overall i would recommend this to anyone who camps, backpacks, or enjoys bushcraft."
3,It was Disappointing but it works,"They can't lie, it MUST make a 3000 degree spark, but the spark would only be 3000 degrees RIGHT at the VERY point of creation, and cools RAPIDLY as it flies through the air. It's also very difficult to light anything if you're an amateur. It might be easy with training, but there aren't really any instructions that come with it. I've worked out several ways to use it and using the best method I've tried I can get a spark distance of a yard (about a metre) and it still won't light anything for me unless I use some sort of flammable spray like Deodorant first.It's pretty cool though. Makes a lot of light, with a very bright spark, it hurts if you look at it.Maybe you need better tinder too, I've used newspaper, magazines, tissues, straight wood, a dry leaf. Nothing."
3,Not So Hot...,"Magnesium-based tools are significantly easier for starting fires. This striker generates a lot of good sparks, but will only ignite the driest of tinder... would suggest a product like the StanSport magnesium fire starting tool over this product."
5,Best! Firesteel! EVER!,"This firesteel blew me away! It comes with a thin coating of something that you have to scrape through to get to the firesteel, which is a nice feature because you won't accidentally set off a shower of sparks inside your backpack or wherever. Very durable and will light just about anything! I really like that you can scrape it and get a few sparks, or really dig it in, and flick your wrist foreward as you scrape to get literally a shower of sparks! Will most likely get 2-3 more of these! VERY highly recomend!"
5,Most reliable firestarter in the world!,"This is the best there is. It's easy, guaranteed to work (if you take thirty seconds to actually read the instructions and an extra few minutes to practice), and foolproof."
5,Works great,"I got this and couldn't wait to try it out. A friend and I were walking around campus and we stopped and grabbed some dryer lint and some dead leaves and dried grass. I had a fire going in seconds. It works great; the cord is more than long enough for you to be able to use the striker with ease. The key is good tinder, straight up leaves won't catch a spark, get something like dryer lint or cat tail fluff. I love it, it was totally worth the money, and it will go with me on every outdoor outing."
2,lets cut the BS!,"1. Item doesn't look too flimsy, time will show if it will fall apart, the strap however is quite short and limits the movement.2. Item does throw sparks however igniting something with it will requires a lot of training, repetition and luck. To put it into perspective I turned on my stove top gas burner skipping the ignition so only natural gas was hissing, with the protective paint already off it took 7 strokes to ignite the NGEDIT: get the magnesium starter instead - its pretty much the same rod (just smaller) with a block of magnesium attached to it, its half the price (8 bucks) and it works with leaves and such, The reason why the Firesteel is rated for 12000 strikes is because you're going to need every one of them to start a fire outside with natural tinder."
5,really works,"quality firesteel. one strike on dryer lint or good kindling, and a boy scout can start a fire. easier than a magnesium fire starter."
5,Carrington emerges as a superstar,"This first book in English on the English surrealist, Leonora Carrington is wildly overdue. Her mate, Max Ernst, now the subject of a major retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, chose well. Carrington's sensibility is exquisite, and this new work reveals in a finely balanced and deligthfully readable way the deep nature of her contribution to one of the most undervalued of all art movements in the 20th century. Leonora is now in her 90s and still carries her laundry up many flights of stairs in Mexico City--this monograph is a welcome addition to our understanding of her energy and her accomplishment as a painter of the first water."
4,A feminist book about the tarot,"I actually bought this book several months before I bought the Motherpeace cards--I liked the card interpretations better than the art. The book was useful for reading any deck--the meanings correspond most closely, of course, with the Motherpeace deck, but they can also add a different flavor to a reading with any deck. Motherpeace, as you probably already know, is a deck that focuses on ancient matriarchal culture and its contact with patriarchy. History doesn't tell us much, but a woman angry at the world can find some comfort in the theory anyway. The Motherpeace book will add a slant to your reading that will give you a sense of power--whether you possess worldly power or not. And it may give you a sense of hope about the kind of society we could build if we'd stop fighting. And, politics aside, it's a pretty solid tarot book in general."
5,An amazing accomplishment,"I only gave this book 5 stars because no more than 5 are allowed.This book is in a class by itself. All or essentially all other books that deal with homosexuality do so from a specific point of view: either- conservative (homosexuality is a behavior -- what one does -- that is abnormal, unnatural, chosen, changeable, intrinsically immoral and hated by God) or- liberal (homosexuality is an orientation -- what one is -- that is unchosen, fixed, morally neutral, accepted by God and is normal and natural for a minority of adults).The authors of this book have attempted to describe all vierwpoints about homosexuality in an objective manner. It is an amazing accomplishment."
2,doesn't work well,"It looks quality. The problem is, it has a hard time rewinding the last 5-10 feet. I've tried tensioning the mechanism but to no avail. The last 5-10 feet, depending, engage the stop mechanism, so you have to keep pulling it out, feeding it back in (like a seatbelt that engages and is hard to retract). For $300, that's not acceptable. I've had it in my shop for over a month. It was properly installed and was mounted right beside a Coxreels hose reel, which works great. Fortunately, Amazon has a great return policy, so I'm sending it back and just ordered a Coxreels cord reel. It's $100 more, but with the time I've wasted trying to feed the Reelcrap back in, I'll be satisfied in the long run. I emailed Reelcraft about the issue but didn't hear back. The other thing I like about Coxreels is that EVERYTHING they make is made in the USA. Some of Reelcraft's stuff is made in China. There you have it."
4,Good but not his best,"Walter Trout is one of the best however this album is not. There are a mixture of superb and some so so tracks. My belief is that it is mostly a choice of songs that is the problem. Walter is a fine guitarist with a fairly good voice as illustrated by 'Got a broken heart', 'Obstacles', 'Hard time blues' and others but there are also many tracks which pale in significance such as ""Marie's Mood"" or ""In love with you again"" which are something out of a 50's pop album rather than a blues based offering. My personal favourite Walter Trout CD is the John Mayall ""Life in the Jungle"" live album."
3,Flashy and Dull,"I've owned this CD for several years and just pulled it out recently to see if I was missing anything. Not really. At least on this disc, Trout sounds pretty much the same on every cut -- same white-boy mildly growly voice, same flashy but repetitive, lick-laden Strat (and the same licks over and over), same unmemorable songs. Oh, he can play his guitar, sure, but he's just not in the same league as, say, Thackery, let alone any of the legends like SRV, Hendrix, etc. In fact, if you want to know what makes (or made) those guys so great, just listen to Trout and hear what he can't do."
5,Imaginative,"This movie in intense and creative. Violence is included along with a beautiful story line. Highly reccommended. Our family loves it, but our young girls 6 & 8 have only seen some parts allowed by us. Loved this movie and any others by Miyazaki."
4,Great film for a great price,"Not for the faint hearted, but for the child @ heart. Has episodes of violence to cities and fire imagery and violence to animals. But overall...I did really like this movie."
5,The greatest anime film ever made,"I cannot descibe how important this film is. If this masterpiece does not change your life, or make you want to change the world- well, you have lost yourself.Maybe Joe Hisashi's greatest soundtrack ( which is saying alot).Forget about Lord of the rings, or star wars, this film is the beginning of the Miyazaki universe. Laputa takes place ""somewhere"" in this world, as does Princess Mononoke.The review before mine is much more detailed- all I can say is that This is in my top 3 favorite films of all time! Allow yourself the pleasure of experiencing this. my Teto!"
5,Lovely quiet,"I love this. It was done in 1984, but I love it. Similar style to Princess Mononoke-hime. I love the way in which Japanese animation can be so quiet. I never realized how much constant music, as in most American/European animation, moves the action of the film even when nothing is really happening. It's as though the viewer never gets to relax and just view. In Japanese animation there are often lulls of musicless movement that are very active but almost in a meditative internal sort of way. It's really lovely and this film has many of those moments. They still manage to engage the viewer but you can do so in a nice detached space. No wonder western animation stresses me out so much."
5,Great movie for education as well as fun,The prominent director made the story fascinating. I'm pretty sure that it is a great movie for students as well as adults.
3,"Nice Spectacle, but not his best work.","The Nausicaa story was a Manga that Miyazaki wrote between other movie projects during the 70's.It's a sprawling, wonderful story told in around 1300 pages - possibly the best Manga I've ever read, very comparablewith The Lord of The Rings with a lot of interesting philosophy and plot-twists and future sci-fi details that touch onartificial intelligience, people attempting to live forever through science, Post-Apocolyptic tribal-warfare, etc.It has a lot to say.The movie version is a cut down fragment of the Manga.Aside from the dazzling visuals, it's not very interesting.The plot is very nature-earthy Do - gooder etc, but it's not very thoughtful.It's really aimed at younger kids. It's a shame they couldn't animate the whole thing.Anyone who loves Miyazaki should definitely read the Manga - one of the best ever - itused to be rare & very valuable but I think it's been republished recently."
3,Not as good as his best work.,"I own Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service, so I expected more of the same. This is not in the same body of work.While the animation is beautiful, and the heroine brave and resourceful, it is a cautionary tale of man's destruction of his environment. There are endless war sequences which I find boring as an adult, and which are entirely inappropriate for children.In fact, the entire film should not be watched by anyone under eleven years of age.There are bloody stabbings, the murder of an old man, the grappling of insects which children will find ""cute,"" and one of the main characters is a multiple amputee.It is good, but not great, and doesn't bear multiple viewings, as some here suggest."
4,cute movie,Saw this movie a few years ago and it was one that I really wanted to own. Really like the theme.
4,"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, anime film","Ok, another Ghibli work of art which of course means it is excellent as usual. Isn't that a good thing to have as your reputation? There are similar themes in most of their product line, usually a respect for nature that modern industrial imperial economies have forsaken in ignorance of the usual karmic aspects from such disrespect. There is a price to be paid, a cause and effect relationship, whether you know and understand it or not. This film is a nice telling of that price on the people even as the tunnel vision empire builders keep repeating their mistakes endlessly in their ignorance. This makes the story rather timeless given it is the human tradition for the past many eons that continue today. The names change, but the practices remain the same.Take care of Mama, and mama will take care of you."
2,A real disappointment!,"I rented this movie. Thank God I didn't buy it. The story sounded like it was written by an eight year old. It was long and boring at times. If you would like to see a better one I would suggest my neighbor totoro, spirited away, kiki's delivery service, and the cat returns. These are far better graphics, and great story plots. If you want to waste your time and money then watch it!"
1,Why anybody thinks in spanish people???,"None of all the blu-rays I searched today about anime, such a Studio Ghibli productions, has spanish subtitles. Well, I dunno if anyone is aware that the spanish people actually exist. Yes, many of us understand english but still. I don't ask even spanish language in the dvd or blu-ray editions, only subtitles. That's so hard to get??"
4,Miyazaki's Genius at Work,"Even though this is a bit environmental in nature, it is still a truly marvelous film. Anyone who buys it won't be disappointed!"
4,Another Carl Macek version,"I found that there is a missing squence from the movie. When Nausica? lands the airship with the glider and the Ohmu's surface there is a dream squence that is suppost to be there but to my dismay and horror I was reminded of Carl Macek attempt to bring this to the public's entertainment way back when he renamed this and released it as ""Warriors of the Wind"".I still rate this as Miyazaki's Epic Manga and Masterpiece but it still needs to be kept as is in the whole length and time.I admit I am a pure Anime Otaku. I just wished that they would keep the Anime complete and not hack important sceens out."
3,I wanted to like this Avatar precursor,"Being a great admirer of the director's work I was greatly looking forward to viewing this early ""epic masterpiece"". Unfortunately - perhaps because it is apparently a condensed reworking of a TV series - I found it incoherent and extremely difficult to follow. Who was attacking who and why became extremely tedious. Powerful ecological concerns were evident and admirable, as were, as always in Miyazaki's work, great visual imaginative details and images. But it seemed endless and confusing despite my positive predisposition to want to like it. What is perhaps most interesting is the degree to which this film is obviously the source of inspiration for many of the ideas in James Cameron's even more disappointing Avatar. So many details were reworked in the latter that Cameron should have be embarrassed to have not credited Miyazaki's concepts."
2,I must be missing something....,"I really did not like this movie, and I absolutely love this genre and this director's work. What happened? This movie was just toooooo weird. Giant bug shells...?? Confusion as to what exactly the plot was...?? I had no idea what was going on and quite frankly I found that I didn't care. I hate saying this, because I love this kind of movie (Howl's Moving Castle lifted my spirit, I've seen it more times that I can count; The Cat Returns is beautiful; Spirited Away is awesome, etc...), but I really did NOT like this one. I didn't care about the lead character, and felt I never got to know her at all. She was dull and had no discernable heroic qualities. I found none of the other characters even memorable. The animation itself was gorgeous, however.I wish I could share in the apparant joy that everyone else here has for this one, I really do, but I have to be honest and quite frankly this movie was totally boring and made absolutely no sense."
4,Nausicaa of the valley of the Wind,I purchased this for my kids - they really like these movies from producer Hayao Miyazaki. This one is about a young girl who finds harmony with nature when the world has been poisened from polution and war. The few surviors learn to live with the land.It's for kids 13 and over- younger kids wouldn't understand the meaning.
5,Girl Wonder,"This is the Miyasaki I was looking for. Great animation, great story and a girl hero. Wonderful action film with a strong sense of caring for the environment and all the creatures. Loved it."
4,great anime,A great Hayao Miyazaki film. Highly recommended. This is a two disc set but the DVD extra are a little disappointing. Also you may find it available at Costo.
4,Anime 2 decades old still better than most anime of today.,"When I got this, I was weary about it looking dated due to it being over 20 years old. Nothing could be farther from the truth as the animation and storyline put to shame most other animated movies of today. Really awesome and entertaining movie."
2,This DVD version is horrible.,"This film is my favorite anime of all time! But this DVD version, released by Disney, is absolutely horrible. The picture and audio are flat and obviously were not digitally remastered. The original release looks and sounds better than this version. It looks like they copied the old video (aged 20 years), quickly dubbed in English parts, slapped it in a new package, and then charged double for it.Except for Patrick Stewarts part, the acting on the English voiceovers are dreadful as well. The butchered US version released in the 80's is better then this version. I waited forever for this to be released, excited about Disney releasing it in all it's original glory, shame on you Disney for releasing this."
5,Why it took 20 years?,"Without any doubt, this is one of the best animation film ever produced. It is a shame that it has taken 20 YEARS!!! to be released in the U.S."
2,Too Bad It's from Disney,"The animation is excellent, the story surperb, the quality of the DVD is marginally acceptable... there is a small note on the back of the package 'may not work in all DVD players' All the anime DVD's I viewed on the Disney label intermittently pause or skip. It's interesting that this problem is limited to Disney DVDs. I am really disappointed. I've come to expect quality products from Disney, their DVDs are not!"
4,Not the best Miyazaki film. But still a masterpiece,"In a post-apocalyptic future the world is taken over by poisonous fungi. The remaining humans live near the plants and try to prevent their spread. In the valley of the wind princess Nausicaa lives with her father the King. Their warmongering neighbors have a terrible plan that threatens the peaceful valley of the wind. Nausicaa must find her hidden potential and save their home.This is a great movie. It has lots of great characters and good drama. The voice cast is also good, just like all the other Miyazaki films. It amazes me that this isn't even one of his better films. but it's still a masterpiece. Any anime fan should love this movie. If you like Nausicaa then check out these other Miyazaki films: Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, Whisper of the Heart, Grave of the Fireflies, and Kiki's Delivery Service."
4,Nausicaa,"Nausicaa is not one of my favorite Studio Ghibli movies. There is just something about it that doesn't have the spark and wonder of some of the other films. That said, it is still worth watching. The english dub is rather well done and enjoyable. It might not stand next to Totoro for me, but I still think it is worth watching."
3,it could be much better...,"i read Naushika in Animegie (i am not sure this mazagine still exists. it was like late 70s or early 80s.) when they decided to make a movie out of the comics, even i was a child, it seemed really odd timing because the story was only in the beginning (the second or third book, i believe the sixth or seventh is the last one). so i thought it would be a series of Naushika movies because when i went to the openning of the movie, it was an obvious unfinished work. many ppl felt the same way. i was not sure the intention of Mr. Miyazaki or the sponsor (tokuma shoten), but it was not the best work of Mr. Miyazaki for sure.i like ""mirai shonen conan"" (this is not the conan you are thinking about, NHK anime from 70s) or even ""alpes no shojo heidi"", Mr. Miyazaki's old work, but Naushika movie was a bit disappointment even for a child."
2,"Read the Manga, Skip the Movie","I had always heard wonderful things about this movie, but I decided to read the manga first. The manga is brilliant, violent, and complex- I highly recommend it. The movie, on the other hand... is not so great. They tried to cram four long graphic novels into one two-hour movie, and it really shows. The story is awkwardly compressed, and frankly a bit of a wreck. Despite the nice animation, I didn't enjoy it very much at all.Mind you, I have no problem with book-to-film translations in general- I thought Lord of the Rings was wonderfully done. This movie just isn't very well written or translated to the screen, though. Frankly, Nausicaa would have worked much better as a one-season tv series.So in short...Film: 4/10Manga: 9/10"
3,You can tell it's early Miyazaki,"""Nausicaa"" lacks the fluidity of animation and depth of visual detail of Miyazaki's later works - plus, Nausicaa is just too perfect of a heroine, and everyone she meets goes gaga over how perfect she is. The story lags a bit, but the ending is sufficiently ""feel-good"" to make the watching worth it.In the original release the character's name sounds more like Naushika, and I wish they would have kept that, because Nausicaa sounds too much like ""nausea."" Not a good link!"
3,Blu-Ray?,"This is by far one of my favorite Miyazaki film. I used it watch it a lot on VHS when I was just a kid. Maybe it's just me but I honestly didn't feel like it was ""blu-ray"" quality. I don't think I would have been able to tell if it was a DVD-rip. It pretty much reminded me of the same quality when I used to watch it on VHS. Also, the caption isn't very good. It doesn't match up with the English narrative; slightly annoying. I'd expected something more from Disney."
5,miyazaki fan,i had this film on vhs for years and seeing now on Dvd answers alot of questions love it even more with the whole story
5,Miyazaki Gem,"This is another gem from Miyazaki, It is another environmental morality tale likePrincess Monanokee, but set in a post apocalyptic setting. My five year old and I were bothdelighted by the story. The character motivation is at some points a little hazy,but this is more than made up for by beautiful animation and a fascinatingvision of what if."
1,Utterly unsatisfying,Utter garbage and and unsatisfying waste of my hour and 39 minutes.I'll bet me mum that you will feel the same way.
1,Wow. That's a baaaaaaaaaad movie!,"The River King may very well be the worst film I have ever seen. From the first minute on I was consistently bored out of my mind.If faced with the prospect of viewing this straight to video disaster, choose to do something more pleasurable with your time, like, having oral surgery or doing Algebra problems."
4,Understated excellence,"No big noise, no computer graphic effects, just a good screenplay, well-acted and enjoyable. Recommended!"
2,Disappointing and empty,"This is a moive that simply does not deliver on any level. I agree with the reveiwer who lamented the waste of Ed Burns's talents; otherwise, the movie is dreadfully predictable, stonily acted and unsatisfying. It's a shame, in a way, because a better film seems to be hiding behind this narrow execution. The actress playing Carlin is simply too old for her role, and her character, who seems so pivotal, is given short shrift (perhaps she ended up on the cutting room floor). The scenes between Burns's character, Grey, and his father are just too much psychobabble for words, and the stunted ""romance"" between Grey and the Lit teacher (a wooden performance at best) is lacking in sparks. No wonder I never herad of this film when it was released (or not, as one reviewer here indicates). Very disappointing."
1,Don't waste your time,"I've never been one to put much stock in the critical reviews of most movies, since too many times I've read terrible reviews, only to see a movie and thoroughly enjoy it; however, in the case of ""The River King"", the overwhelmingly negative reviews I read prior to viewing were certainly justified. To be short and to the point, this movie absolutely sucks. The storytelling is horrid and there's no way the book can be any worse. The acting throughout the movie is pretty subpar and the director does a horrid job at tying everything together. The ending was very anticlimactic and certainly unsatisfying. I'd go into greater depth, but this movie was just so bad that I can't even find the words to describe it. If I had to point out any bright spots, it would be the cinematography, which at times was pretty striking. In closing, save your money and don't see this movie."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was pleasantly surprised when I found that The River King, one of my favorite Alice Hoffman books, had been made into a movie. Honestly, I did not have my hopes up though. It just came out in 2005 & I'd heard nothing about it. I bought it anyway. Big mistake! It was terrible. The basic plot follows the book, but that's the only recognizable element of the extraordinary novel. Hoffman's writing is elegant & descriptive. The natural world intrudes on the man-made one. There are legends of the past that come to play on current events. None of this was included. More than once, I felt that simple voice-over could have helped to enhance the film and include all of the internal activites. And I'm not generally a fan of voice overs. I generally like Ed Burns, but he was miscast in this role. In fact, all of the major roles were miscast. If you're as curious as I was and are a fan of Hoffman, rent the movie before you buy."
1,What kind of company agrees to put out such garbage.,"Literally the worst movie I have ever seen. PERIOD. Its no wonder that it went straight to video. When this web site asked me how many stars out of 5 i gave it, i had to give it one star, but only because there is no such thing as negative 2 stars. Anyone that gives this pile of a movie anything over 1 and a half stars has either never seen a good movie before, or is recieving a check straight from the director. Don't waste a moment of your life watching it. I don't wanna waste a moment more even thinking about it."
3,A Promise Not Kept,"This is a thoughtful, well-made film but its problem is that the ending leaves the viewer disappointed and let-down. It poses a number of interesting, possible answers to the death of a young man, yet the ""truth"" of that death leaves both the viewer and the hero of the story feeling that we have wasted our time in trying to make sense of it. This film has the saving grace of Jennifer Ehle, whose beauty and grace shine far beyond her role. There is something magical about this actress and the film is worth seeing if only to watch her. Another of her films, ""Possession,"" is similarly lit by her performance."
3,Ignore the Hateful Reviewers,"Please ignore the hateful reviewers. This was an entertaining film. The lead actor was great - and very handsome. The lead actress (high school student) was also quite good.I didn't give the movie a four because of a few things. 1. The ending seemed to lack direction. 2. The adults and kids at the school were very one-dimensional. 3. Sane characters made rash decisions (don't want to give things away -- but this involves employment and engagement issues). 4. When the main mystery was revealed, it's unclear who exactly was having the flashback! That's the biggest goof.Nonetheless, this is an entertaining film."
1,Disappointment,This is the worst screen adaption of a book ever. They managed to turn Alice Hoffman's fantastic book into something boring and ordinary. David Kane and whoever else might be responsible for the story line certainly didn't get what was special about Alice Hoffman's novel. What a shame
3,What year is it?,"BIG SURPRISE: the cleric wanna be didn't do it and the cleric who was...well, you know the ending. Still, there's a bit of a ""rip van winkle"" twist that raises this otherwise ""wouldn't waste my time film"" to a 3."
2,A disappointment,"I suppose that it's because I have Jim Croce's own version of these songs ingrained in my head so deeply -- most of the covers are fairly sticky sweet, the exception being the cover of ""One Less Set of Footsteps"", which I think rocks no matter who is singing it. I would suggest that Jim Croce fans get the original greatest hits album -- this one misses."
2,I do not think that it is a good buy,"This tribute album was released in 1997, and it features some of the stars of Nashville performing hits of the great Jim Croce (1943-73). Now, as you might expect with an album like this, it's a bit of a mixed-bag. For example, I think that Charlie Daniels did a great job with Box #10, as did Mark Collie with Rapid Roy. However, on the down side, I really did not like some of the artists' versions of the songs.I liked less than 50% of the songs, so overall I do not think that it is a good buy. By all means, buy the MP3 versions of the songs you like, but I really don't think you'll want the entire album."
5,Awesome book especially for guys,"This book is amazing! What a powerful message! It is written so well! It doesn't come across in a cheesy way. I think it would be great for youth groups. I'm buying one for my teen sons. I didn't realize it was written by Dr. Dobson's son when I started reading it so that doesn't affect my opinion of the book. However, I see Dr. Dobson as a father figure. If you want to be challenged in a fresh way to be more like Christ, buy this book!"
1,Now we know why they hate us,There is no difference between Christian martyrdom or Islamofascist martyrdom. This book is a frightening distortion of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.
1,Nut-allergic customers beware!,"I can't believe so many products, for babies' sensitive private parts, have shea butter! You do not know if your child is going to be nut-allergic...so don't use products on the child that contain shea butter! I am allergic to nuts and any personal care product (lotion, wipes, etc) that contains shea butter gives me horrible hives. If your child gets a fierce diaper rash using these, consider the possibilty of an allergy..or better yet, don't use nut products like shea butter (which comes from the shea NUT) on babies when you don't know if they will be allergic...exposing them repeatedly so early on to nuts may trigger a nut allergy due to ""system overload."""
5,Great Wipes,"The pop-up style it is so much easier to use especially when you need to grab one quick. Huggies is also thicker than other well known brands, so you only need 1 wipe to do the same job! Granted some other brands are cheaper, but they become more expensive when you have to use more to do the same job."
5,these are the BEST,"I love these wipes. Huggies makes a great product in whatever fragrance you get. They are thick, easy to get out of the box and have a nice clean fragrance. The shea butter ones do their thing very well without irritating my baby's bottom."
1,Diaper Rash,"My 11 month old has never had a diaper rash, until now. My husband bought these wipes yesterday. She usually uses Huggies Natural Care and we have been very pleased. These shea butter wipes gave her a rash within 24 hours. I have never seen anything like it on her. I definitely wouldn't recommend these wipes."
1,Allergy to Shea Butter,"I bought these wipes because I thought they would be nice & soft on my 12 month old daughter's skin.....unfortunately she developped a raging, bleeding, red diaper rash. At first, I couldn't figure out if it was something she ate-but her diet hadn't changed -so that was not it. I changed her every hour and was bathing her a few times a day-still using the wipes-not realizing they were the culprit. Finally it hit me that we just started using these wipes. Within 24 hours of not using the wipes her bum was almost back to normal. These wipes should really have a consumer warning on them."
1,The smell. I cannot stand the smell.,These wipes clean well.They arrived promptly.They stink something fierce.I cannot stand the way they smell.
1,stylistically diverse,"Robert Ariosto's musical work could be deemed the success of a lifetime. The influences and individuals he works with on this album reflect a lifes love of music, expression and experience. His vocals tie in a mellow Daultry, an excited Buffet, and a soulfull Springstein. This CD is an excellent addition to anyones collection, perfect for when friends come for dinner or a glass of wine. Let the music of Rob Ariosto's lifetime become part of the soundtrack of yours."
1,Not as advertised.,This cable is a Cat 5e Belkin patch cable but it is not the one pictured. It is a 2 ft black patch cable with crimp on connectors. It is not a snagless molded cable.
3,Lighter side of battles!,"This book deals with serious subjects in a newsy & unfussy manner. The author uses almost no heavy historical jargon & a minimum of dates, which makes for an entertaining & informative series of battle accounts. Weir describes the historical background & central characters with just enough detail to tickle one's interest. Some of his suppositions & links that develop the negative consequences of the ""fatal victory"" were not always wholly convincing. The actual accounts of the battles I thought were a little lightweight. He is however, obviously very well read & a good storyteller. I do recommend anyone interested in military history to give this a book a try, provided they can find the paperback version, as I did. I also suspect that this book will possibly provoke readers into the purchase of some of the ""heavier"" books mentioned in the excellent bibliography."
5,Great ideas - all parents should read,"All parents should read this book. Whether you agree with his ""Benevolent Dictatorship"" style of parenting or not I think pretty much all parents will be able to see themselves in many of the senarios John Rosemond's mentions and can certainly learn a thing or two about how to be a better parent. I have started using several of the techniques mentioned and realize, although I thought I did, I really don't have a backbone and am very wishy washy with my children which creates chaos. Not gonna miraculouly ""fix"" your children's behavior. You have to work at it. We are on week 2 and my kids are giving me major push back but I can see positive changes and think it will make all of us better in the end."
4,Food for Thought,"I got this book after being given his book ""Parenting by the Book"". I was impressed with his thoughts on why kids are the way they are today and what needs to happen so that they can become productive citizens and content adults. As a teacher, I began looking for ways to deal with kids and parents in a society that promotes attachment parenting. I found this book. While I read this book as a new mother, I also have found help as to how to deal with kids. While I don't fully agree with his thoughts on dealing with babies (birth - 18 mths), I do find his thoughts beyond this age group insightful and true. If you want to read how to raise your baby as part of the family and not the center...read BABYWISE. If you want to read how to discipline your toddler (or older) and how to keep them as part of the family but not the center, read this book or any of John Rosemond's books."
1,save your money,"The last several books of Rosemond's have disappointed- including this one. I read through it recently, hoping for fresh, original material. It is two of his previous books melded together in to one. It could have worked with more fresh content. If you have the bucks to spend, or if you do not have the two books this one is carved from, then get it. The information is good and is useful and common-sense. Stuff we already know from his previous books and newspaper column, however. The ""preachiness"" tone it takes on in places is a turn-off- just ignore that and whatever else doesn't apply to your situation. I hope Rosemond's next book IS fresh and original, but perhaps the bloom is off the rose."
1,Not so thinly veiled Evangelical Fundamentalism,What is so sad for me is that John Rosemond has many excellent interventions for children yet he view's self-esteem as demonic and nefarious. While I can use some of his ideas I warn readers of his narcissistic musing about what he interprets as biblical. A mix of well-grounded advice and psychological immaturity.
1,So-so book,"I used to purchase anything by John Rosemond, but will now make sure of what I'm buying before plunking down my hard-earned money. This book offers nothing new to those of us who've followed his advice for years. One wonders why he doesn't go in a new direction, write on another area of family/child-raising. Same old/same/old, over and over. Good advice for those not familiar with his work, as another reviewer wrote, but not much of anything else for the rest of us - unless you are into collecting his complete works! Stick with his book A Family of Value and you can't go wrong."
3,Raquel Sings - or Did she?,"Enjoyed this tv special, but it would seem that most of the singing was done by Tina Cole for some reason, though Raquel herself had a reasonably nice singing voice. Raquel is heard singing with Tom Jones for that segment but in earlier outdoor shots it is fairly obvious that they used the voice of Tina Cole, well known for being on ""My Three Sons"" and of course being on The King Family TV specials. This was kept rather ""hush hush"" at the time, although I don't see what the big deal is. I am surprised that more people wonder if it's truly Raquel singing most of the songs. Raquel was (and still is) beautiful, a good actress and a trained dancer - if they chose to go with another singing voice for most of the numbers I don't think as detracting from her talent."
4,Okay,"There are plenty of good skits in this book. They aren't necessarily standing ovation skits, but they are decent. I used it with high school drama students."
2,Harsh Tone,"I've read so many good reports on these picks and I thought I would try some but the tone is quite harsh and especially brittle on mandolin; even by two very high end mandolins. It must be the material they are made of as they have a nice rolled edge and are quite thick. These might work for some players but they do not work for me or any of my guitar or mandolin students. Just not a pleasant tone, unfortunately."
4,"My Science Students Say ""This book is really cool""","I am a 5th grade science teacher and require my students to read and report on a scientist biography each semester. This book does an excellent job of retelling the story of Einstein's life, including his life challanges (personal and academic). The book deals with the Nazi rise to power of the 30's and its effects of the scienctific community. This is all done while still giving a accurate and understandable explaiation of Einstein's work. And, most importantly, my students really enjoy it."
5,The mother of all extension cords,"I purchased this product because operation of a portable electric compressor 150' from the house just wasn't working. There was too much resistance/loss in a standard extension cord and it was tripping the circuit breaker in the house. With the ""mongo"" cord the breaker never trips. The only downside is that this thing weighs a ton and coiling it up on your arm to store it is not for the weak. Love it; it seems like it'll wear like iron. I ""stole"" this item from Amazon back in 2005 for $73."
5,This is a fine live album!,"This album features Steely Dan's Donald Fagen, Mike Mc Donald, Phoebe Snow, Boz Scaggs, Charles Brown. This is the best white man soul music show there has ever been. I highly recommend it."
3,Only for the complete die-hard fan,"Which I guess I only thought I was. I'm a huge fan of Fagen, Scaggs, and McDonald, but I just didn't get this one. BTW, I really enjoy the trio together as ""The Dukes of September"", but this just didn't do it for me."
4,NYC R&Soul Revue,Very good version of Green Flower Street and very good musicians and singers. Donald fagen and Michael Mac Donald are the best!
3,waiwaiwaiwai...!,"I listened to this CD because a friend at work insisted on loaning it. Donald Fagen did his usual wonderful job of being Donald Fagen, Boz Scaggs did his usual great job of being Boz, and Charles Brown didn't have to be anyone but himself anyway. The band is as tight as The JBs. *However*...Screaming Phoebe does nothing else but that, and her attempt at Etta James is just pitiful. Michael McDonald likewise. I would rather he sit quietly and listen to what Solomon Burke and Jackie Wilson are doing, or just leave it alone. I am willing to give Johnny Otis credit as the original Blue-Eyed Soulman, but the Old Rascals - not.Look, peeps. Belushi and Ackroyd were kidding!"
2,"i dunno, too much white soul","michael mcdonald, it;s his singing voice, unfortunately.if you like him you will like this.i don;t, didn;t.charles brown, brigati brothers, boy they really didn;t do anything for me.fast forward city.what did i like?i really liked phoebe snow doing 'at last'.boz scaggs was ok.fagen, i can take or leave.his performances here didn;t add anything to the original, for me.wle."
5,One of the best albums you can buy,"This CD is one of those rare albums you can listen to 100 times and it's always great. The live performances are some of the best from each of these solid performers, but Boz Skaggs absolutely grooves with 'Drowning in the Sea of Love.' Michael McDonald sings 'Lonely Teardrops' like it was made for him instead of Clyde McPhadder. Donald Fagan shines in both vocals and keyboards, but Pretzel Logic is just awesome, especially with McDonald asking, ""Where'd you get those shoes?"" One of my Island Albums, for sure, and I bet it will be one of yours."
5,This CD is great!,"I've owned this CD for two years and it's still as bright and interesting as the first time I listened to it. If you enjoy Donald Fagen, Michael McDonald, or Phoebe Snow this is definitely for you!"
1,Poor FM reception from digital tuner,"This product does not have good FM reception. It will not receive clear FM signals from radio stations I normally listen to within a 35 mile radius. Otherwise it is compact, sound is good, nice features but very poor FM tuner. I returned this item for a refund."
1,Quality Problems,I bought a CFDS32 last year. I have hardly used it and I am very disappointed because it does not read CDs any more. SONY is supposed to make good quality products. It seems as if now everything is dispossable. :-(
3,"Nothing New, Earth Shaking or Innovative","The book itself is OK, and John Fuhrman provides some interesting quotable quotes, decent stories and pithy sayings in this short book on leadership. There isn't a lot new or earth shaking here, though. Perhaps the best take away from the book is Furhman's view of ""servant leadership"", and the need for the leader to give in order to receive. Fuhrman notes several times how teaching will iprove the ability to learn and lead, and the leader's role is to facilitate and give to their fellow man. The 21 secerets aren't really well enumerated, and there are lots of good leadership books out there - with this being just another one - and an average one at that. The best part of it is that it is a short read, and for the busy executive - is better than nothing."
1,"Of, for, and by, John Furhman","Each chapter begins with an inspiring quote by John Fuhrman on some aspect of leadership. Each chapter contains an example from John Fuhrman's life. Occasionally he goes outside his own musings to reference someone in his family. One thing John Fuhrman tells us we need to work on is to think more about other people, in order to improve our own leadership potential. How surprising. If you are John Furhman, this book will help you a lot. If not, it's hard to say.It is hard to compare this book to others out there on management and business. The popular books by Collins (e.g. Good to Great) is the result of thousands of hours of analysis based on real data. You're in Charge - Now what? by Neff & Citrin is a synthesis of data captured through hundreds of interviews with CEOs. Due to the quality of books out there, it's hard for me to see the value Mr. Furhman provides."
5,Love it!,"I love this bag! It's quite big, but slouchy, especially after time, which makes it not seem so big. It's also wide enough to fit legal files in it. And when needed, the strap is just long enough to fit across my body."
2,"OK but ""babied"" down","We got this CD when I was pregnant with our son, who is now 17 months old, because we knew the benefits of classical music on young children. I feel that the CD is just OK and it's really ""babied"" down or music box like as the previous reviews suggest. I think it's important for children to hear ""real"" instruments. I would not recommend this CD. If you're looking to expose your child to classical music, go with the real thing."
1,yikes! would say any lover of classical music,"The baby einstein series of music CDs is the equivalent of muzack for babies- horror to the ears!I don't think babies need their music dumbed down to that degree.Anyway, for the parent it's awful to hear. The beauty inherent in the muusic is completely lost, and replaced with whistles, goofy chimes, and plastic pianos. Absolutely horrible."
2,"not ""real "" music","I bougth some items of the same collection...I was dissapointed...It's synthetizer music!!! it's ridiculous because babys are able to listen ""real"" instruments! And I think that this caracteristic is not clairly explained when you buy the product."
1,Synthesizer strikes again!,"As a parent you have to depend on other people to help you decide what is good to expose your child to. Unfortunately, the Baby Einstein company is not exposing your child to good music! It is performed by a synthesizer and while some of the songs are played well, many are not.Their choice of the music to include IS wonderful. They are great works, but they are performed poorly. If you wish to show your child good music DO NOT BUY these CD's! Purchase the songs that are contained on these CD's performed by real musicians, not a computer or synthesizer."
2,"Ugh, what's the point?","I like the Baby Einstein books, so I was enthusiastic about this DVD when I received it as a gift. However, my husband and I were both sorely disappointed. It's nothing but a 30-minute commercial for Baby Einstein products; it shows images of various toys while music-box type Bach melodies play in the background. There are two cute girls featured but they don't do much other than dance around a little bit and babble. I'd much rather play Fantasia for my children, which uses the original orchestral instrumentation and meaningful images.I probably would have given this product just one star except that my 2-year-old actually likes it, so I suppose it's good when I need a break and don't want her to watch regular TV."
2,keep your home videos in your own home,"I loved Baby Mozart, and my family (including the baby!) were quite fascinated with it the first 10 times or so. However, I resented Baby Bach, because I did not like watching the video makers daughters in it. I felt the place for them was in their own home videos, not in my home. Let their grandparents appreciate them. To me, they held no interest. There was no theme. I liked the way Baby Mozart used the same toy for one song. Here you got snippets of toys and musical instruments and someone elses children. The music was pretty, I did not like the way the video was made!"
2,Pretentious French (Neo-new-wave) drivel!,"I hoped this film was a cogent examination of redemption. It turned out to be a recitation of every bad trait ever demonstrated by French males. Egotistical, self-centered, self absorbed braying asses are shown at their worst! How did this thing ever get past the editing crew is beyond me! Surely a turkey looks like a turkey...even in the editing room! Rent a Betty Boop retrospective!"
5,Great Book,"The author writes this book well, and inserts good points. Overall, a great book and a great purchase for its price."
2,They changed the seed ports,"I purchased one of these feeders a couple of years ago and the birds love it. I ordered another one last week and found that the company has re-designed the seed ports. Now all the seed rapidly pours out of the ports, wasting the seed. I attached one of the plastic trays to the feeder and the seed just piles up in mounds. I think the only seed mix that would work would be a jay/squirrel mix."
3,Beautiful but wastes seeds,"I really love the design of this bird feeder as far as aesthetics go. We also specifically bought this feeder because it keeps birds from pooping on the seed, thus potentially spreading disease to other birds (this is an issue with tray feeders). Unfortunately the huge design flaw of this bird feeders is the feeding holes. Each time a bird grabs some seed, about a tablespoon of seed comes spilling out of the hole. It's a huge waste of seed and leaves a mess under your feeder (that if un-cleaned then causes the same poop-seed mix issues as a tray feeder). If this feeder came with holes that had a better device for keeping extra seed in the tube, it would be a five star product."
2,Not durable enough,"After years of use, we thought it was time to replace our Droll Yankee feeder. The squirrel cover and the base shelf were broken from years of use and from falling to the ground from squirrels jumping on it and the suspension strings breaking. We bought this one and soon after we returned from a trip to find it on the ground with all of the rings around the feeding holes torn out either by a squirrel or perhaps a raccoon. The Droll Yankee design prevents that possibility so we found a new cover and a new base for the Droll Yankee and it is back in service. Also in our short use it did not seem that our birds liked being on the curved vertical wire. They prefer the horizontal resting wires under each Droll Yankee feeding hole."
3,Use for large seeds,"This feeder is best suited for use with large seeds like sunflower in the shell or safflower and small to medium size birds. I use sunflower hearts and chips to avoid a mess on my deck, but they tended to slide out the openings so I had to return this feeder. I emailed the manufacturer and found they are redesigning this feeder to address these issues.On the plus side, the copper spiral design is a nice visual change from standard perch feeders. I have 2 of the copper spiral nyjer (thistle) feeders and the birds make a game of moving along the spiral to see if the next bird has better seed, causing the whole line of birds to move. It's fun to watch! The spiral design also keeps larger birds like mourning doves from using the feeder--they can't hold on to perch."
3,Not sure yet if birds hate the feeder or the seed...,"I bought this based on the reviews and I'm not sure if my local birds hate it or the seed inside. I have had it over a month now and emptied and tried new seed mixture. I saw a few birds on it after the seed change, but honestly they are not overwhelming it like I thought they would. Perhaps its due to the fact I have about 6-7 various types of feeders on my property. But this is the only one that is a tube and not holding just niger or thistle seed for finches. I'll give it more time, but if they don't take to it in this cold snap I'm going to say it is a 2 and not even a 3 star item after a few more months of use."
2,Seeds fall out,"The bird feeder was sent as a gift and although it is nice looking,the seeds fall out of the feeder. This is regular feeder mix."
3,cute ring set,its nice. the rings are cute. but u cant really tell what the detail is on them. and u cant read whats written inside the bands. but its still cute for people who like this kind of stuff.
5,what i didn't expect!,i was amazed with the product not only did it come in great condition but it came ahead of time which i didn't expect and was well package! i like the product and won't mind ordering another product from this store again with the same shipment!;)
1,no good for Cavalier,"Recently replaced the spark plugs on my 98 Cavalier with these. The fuel consumption dropped to 24 miles/gal from 28! and I replaced them to hopefully improve fuel consumption. WHen I replaced these Bosch 4304 Pt II with the same as original Delco spark plugs, fuel consumption recovered to 27 miles/gal...."
4,Great bluesy piano,"I first encountered AJ live at a jazz festival in 1993, and got this CD then. I still very much enjoy it. Great piano, a voice that sounds like he's been abusing cigars and whisky for three times as long as he's apparently been alive, and a sense of humour (""He's got a way with women, and he just got away with mine!"") make this a disc I don't let the dust settle on."
4,Fantastic,"Great blend of top-notch musicians (Robben Ford, Jim Keltner), Jim's own fine grand piano playing, some really great tunes, and some whacky, but still mighty fine tunes make for a great cocktail here. The style is relaxed soul blues, a little bit of stride piano even. It definitely stands out, and the production, especially of the grand, is simply SUPERB! This CD helped sell me my stereo, and afterwards I got the salesperson to order me a copy (not so easy to find in Denmark). I highly recommend it!"
3,New England & Canada Cruising-,"Ok is the grade given to the DVD because the format is very ""travel"" typical. The narrator is the typical happy go lucky person and the cliches that come out are very 1980s. The taping is very good and the stories are pretty good. There are many other fine ports in New England that could have been covered, some are found on [...]."
1,what a scam,"I bought this for my three kids to play with this summer and I am extremely dissapointed.First, the picture on the box shows this giant inflatable ball. Not so. The ball is actually about the size of a small beach ball.Second, you need extremely high water pressure for the product to work as advertised. The only thing our ball did was sit on the ground and spray water out the sides.We also purchased another Six Flags item thinking this one might have been a fluke and unfortunatley I was wrong. We bought a whale pool and they had shown this big pool with a whale slide that comes with it. The pool is big enough for two small children.Just watch out for Six Flags and their marketing scams."
1,Flat,"I bought this for my 12 year daughter for her birthday. We followed the directions step-by-step and all it did was sat on the ground and sprayed water. Then she thought you would have to move it to make it go up in the air, like the picture, but as soon as she moved it it exploded and ripped. It was a flat disappointed on her birthday. She wants me to buy another just for memory sake but, I would not recommend it for anyone. It was a great disappointment."
1,Lame toy,"I bought the version that looks like a soccer ball. It, too, looked huge on the box. But it's not. It did shoot water out, but it didn't move all, no matter what the water pressure."
1,RIP OFF!!,"Do not buy this toy. It's a disappointing, rip-off, cheater toy. It sits there like a lump spraying thin jets of water.Fun only if an adult stands there whirling it in the air.Shame!"
1,Didn't work & then popped,"Firstly, the ball was smaller than I thought it would be.I inflated the ball and then attached the hose. Unfortunately, the ball became filled with water and could not bounce or even lift off the floor as shown in the picture. the children trying to play with it were excited but couldn't do much with it beside try to push it around (very impossible for a 5yr old) and eventually gave up and started playing in the sprinkled water but even that was short lived as the ball popped open.A true waste of money for something that never worked properly and lasted less that 5 minutes. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Terrible and disappointing,"This is a terrible excuse for a sprinkler toy. It fills with water and lays like a lump with the tiniest 4"" sprays of water. It quickly becomes so heavy you can't even move it and then it frustrates the kids by doing nothing at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Great positive metal album.,"Good CD, good band. If you really like them, as I do, try to find their first CD, entitled Struggle."
2,just ok,"this product works, but just ""OK"". It's hard for people on the other end to hear you unless you are in an absolutely quiet place. It picks up the air conditioning in the car and makes it sound like you are in a windstorm. It's a little difficult to put on in a hurry too. But hey, i paid 5 bucks for it."
3,good,This is a pretty good book. Its a bit hard to understand some of the lingo from other parts of the world but one will get use to that if they read ES books.
3,Disappointed,"I took this out of the box and one of the glass picture fronts slid down onto the rotating base. The base is cut wrong and I am going to have to affix the glass after putting the pictures in, to hold it in place. This is for my beloved dogs ashes, I should not have to fix it before placing them in it. It may be the grief, but this made just me so mad."
2,Not What I Was Expecting...,"Though I did like reading the book, and I agree it was a page turner, it wasn't what I was expecting. Maybe it was because it was a little younger than I had intended or because it was the first one of the series I actually read, but I was hoping for a little more depth and resolution. Overall, I personally wouldn't recommend this to my peers, soley because I think it's the kind of the thing we were all happy to get away from after high school."
2,This Series was Good but it's over,"*SPOILERS*Forgive the old fashioned term, but this series jumped the shark. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those preachy people who says bad things about this series. The first four books were great, and parts of this one i.e. the beginning were fairly good too. There's just different levels of unrealistic you can take. Rich spoiled teens full of drama on the Upper East Side: Good Unrealistic. Cults, Sudden Hookups that come out of Nowhere, The Least Popular Girl Moving in With the Most: Bad Unrealistic. Let's hope the It Girl doesn't mess up as thoroughly as this. We loved you, Gossip Girl, but you're dead. RIP."
3,it was straight,it was pretty good BUT i wouldn't waste my money on it. you'll be much more satisified checking this book out at the library.
3,"A nice thought, but unrealistic","Now, I already don't view the Gossip Girl series as being a great series.. the books are basically soap operas, but no matter how mind-wasting they are, I can't stop reading them.The school year is coming to an end, and Blair is still waiting for her response from Yale. Her relationship with Nate isn't doing so well (AGAIN), and Serena is back to being the carefree one who floats through the scenes. However, both Serena and Nate are both beginning to realize that they would rather end their partying ways to hang out with the ones they love.While both Jenny and Blair are focusing on what they COULD have, Nate and Serena want to return to what they already have. Jenny and Blair both achieve in the end, but the misfits Serena & Nate blow everything up.. once again. The drama never ends, does it?""Nobody Does it Better"" shows a more loving side as the characters DO realize, in their final moments together in High School, that nobody does it better than the ones they love."
4,good series,"Even though the gossip girl novels have NO PLOT, it is fun to read them. however, i won't pay $15 just to read them. they take one night. get them from the library. one of the best out of the series."
1,Find another book!,"I'm shocked. It really worries me that so many girls my age read these books. I don't like to sound like a parent, but these books set a really bad example. The characters are so spoiled, it's disgusting. And they're mean, not to mention slutty. How can this book be a bestseller? It's trash. Don't people get bored with girls acting trashy and sleeping around? Look, read what you want, but parents should be warned about this book. Gossip Girl is a serious waste of your time!!"
1,PARENTS BEWARE!!!!,"Parents BEWARE!!! These books are littered with very strong profanity! I'm not kidding, check it out for yourself at any local bookstore. The ""f"" word appears throughout the entire book. Do we really want our young teens or young adults reading this? Did you know these books were written to appeal to the 13-16 year olds, and they need to be reading this...how low have we stooped if we permit this like of junk to be in their hands? It is utter filth!"
2,Meh...,"If you tend to lean to the teen gossip novels then you'll probably enjoy this book. It does a great (and somewhat obnoxious) job of including names of big designers and ""subtle"" hints about the fake escapades of real celebrities. The only real problem I could ocme up with while reading it was that the series was getting a bit redundant. Sure new ""juicy"" issues were cropping up (Jenny in her diva-mode, Blair losing her virginity) but nothing's real changed. Nate's stoned, there's always that air of sexual tension between Serena and Nate (but now it develops in to much more then air). It's just getting a bit repetitive. I just hope that the 8th book will bring about new problems for everyones favorite N.Y. quasi-celebrities."
3,Guilty pleasure,"The rich Manhattan teenagers who inhabit the world of Gossip Girl are nearing graduation. Decisions regarding college selection are made, and Jenny becomes a rebel slut. The best parts were the interactions between Blair and Vanessa, what an interesting pairing! Looking forward to more of that.These books are so addictive, I just wish there was a little more substance and something morally redeemable about them, instead of being such a guilty guilty pleasure."
5,Excellent,"So good, sharp and fine!! Is a good Product. I always trust in Meade. I bougth other eyepiece and works awesome."
1,Died after only 1 year,The unit stopped working after only a little more than 1 year. Replacing bulbs no help. Transformer must be defective. A lot of money for one year's use!!
3,Magnifier Lamp,"To call this lamp ""heavy duty"" is grossly misleading. One of the knobs fell off almost immediately. It requires regular tightening to keep it from flopping down. The springs are not strong enough to keep it in position. This lamp is not suitable for work which requires that it be repositioned frequently."
2,A disappointment...probably going back,"First..this lamp is made in China..need I say more..Second...it says the arms are tension adjustable..I don't see how beyond stratching the springs or drilling and threading new screw holes that hold the springs.Third...the base mount is pretty weak and allows too much movementFourth...and this may be particuliar to my eyes...but I have 3 pairs of glasses each used for a different reading or working distances, but none of them seem to work with this lamp and magnification."
2,Lasted lest than 3 years.,"I bought this for my wife, who makes jewelry. She loved the lamp, but after less than 3 years, the pivot at the bottom of the lower arm broke. It's not repairable, and I can't find replacement parts. So now I have to spend another $60-$100 for a more durable lamp. $20 per year for a lamp seems excessive."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Do not waste your money on this lamp!! This product is so poorly made that we have gone through 2 lamps in less that 2 1/2 months. The lamps had not been used much, but in both cases metal parts broke. And the Grandrich company will not work with you if the product breaks after 30 days. Save you sanity and get a better product."
1,I Had To Return Mine,"I bought mine new, but it looked as if someone had already opened the box by the time I got it. On top of that, the light bulb didn't work and one of the base clamps was bent. I sent it right back for a refund.I thought I would save some money with this particular model (The picture looked good), but I think I'll spend a little more next time and hopefully get something that works."
1,Very cheap imitation of a good design,I have a similarly designed light that finally failed after 15 years continuous use. This cheap imitation failed in less than a year.It runs very hot for a fluorescent and does not hold its adjustments. I was actually relieved when the bulb burned out so I could throw this annoying bit of garbage out with the trash.
4,Worth the price.,"Bought this a month ago. Although well packed, it arrived with a broken flourescent bulb. In order to use the magnifying lamp right away, I went to Sears and bought a fluorescent bulb for six dollars. I then called the manufacturer and they asked to have the Amazon receipt faxed to them along with address, email, phone number, and the problem, which I did. About two weeks later I got a call saying that they would ship me a new bulb which arrived in about a week . At least I have a spare bulb now and the manufacturer took care of the problem. So far the lamp has been quite useful. It is not as robust as the (much) more expensive ones, but works well enough. Only real defect of my lamp is that the auxiliary AC outlet on the lamp base doesn't work, but I can live with that. For my use (mostly model kit building), it's worth the price, especially with Amazon's free shipping that was in effect when I ordered it."
1,Don't Bother,"I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, broke within days but just long enough to not get a refund. The whole structure of the lamp depends on one small screw and nut which hold two small hooks. Typical Far East engineering, cheap,cheap.cheap."
4,Laptop tray,"great product, now I can use my laptop while relaxing in bed without trying to hold the laptop on my knees.Laptop Overbed Tray"
3,Better than I expected,"The only Hong Kong movies I enjoy watching are ones that star Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, or Jet Li. I didn't expect much from this one, but it surprised me. The violence is so silly it's almost cartoonish, and the bad guy brings a whole new meaning to 'paper cut'."
5,"Down time, quiet time","This is the cd for a time to read or relax or both. When life gets too rushed or when stress is overwhelming, this is the music for the soul. Soft, quiet and serene. It is a slow journey to fill the heart with melodies to live by and love by."
4,Adagio,"you will be so relaxed after listening to this album that all your cares will melt awaythe only negative comment is that in my opinion, on track 13 the second violin sounds to be half an octave higher than the cellobut dont let that spoil an otherwise flawless album"
5,Great Heavy Duty Cord,"This cord is a must for heavy duty, high amp, power tool users. I bought this cord to go with my new PorterCable 15 amp saw because of its #12 gauge size. I wanted a cord that would ensure a proper power supply and low voltage drop to protect my tools from burnout. It certainly is handy and rugged to boot. The bright yellow exterior stands up to rough use and is easy to see on jobsites. I like the lighted plug end; it lets you know when the wire is hot and can be seen in the dark. Thanks, Amazon !"
3,Heavy Duty Cable & Flexible,"I just purchased this cable recently and I used it several times. I bought it to use with my 4 gallon air compressor, that recommended a 12/3 cable, no more than 25 feet long. I like it because it's not vinyl and you can use it in any weather. I use it for all my power tools. Low voltage can overheat and burn your power tools up, if your using a power cord of a smaller size."
5,A whopping good read,"I'm not quite certain why, but I keep seeing shades of Robert Parker in Rosenfelt's books. Perhaps because Andy is quick with a quip and Rosenfelt writes very good dialogue. Perhaps because Andy loves his dog and thinks it's the most perfect dog in the universe, even though it's not quite as annoying as Spencer's Pearl the Wonder Dog. Perhaps because Andy has a serious love interest to whom he's not married, although, happily, Laura doesn't have any of Susan's annoying characteristics. But Rosenfelt is no imitation and definitely stands on his own. He has created some great characters and yet isn't afraid to kill off important characters. He knows how to balance humor and tension. The tone of the book is light, but it contains a whopping good, unpredictable mystery. I've really been enjoying this series and am really looking forward to continuing with the series."
3,A little Disappointing....,"I loved the first two books! But this one didn't seem to really get into the story until mid-way through the book. Still love the author, but this book wasn't up to par."
2,Big disappointment!,"I had read such praise for this book, including much of what's written here. When I listened to the audio version on a recent trip, I got to my destination before the ""big"" reveal at the end of the book. I waited until the return trip to hear the ending- I'd usually listen to the end on my Discman if the book was good- and I turned didn't finish listening then when I realized it was heading exactly where I expected it would go. <Yawn> You can choose something a lot better than this one."
5,Mystery with humor,Fast paced mystery with some humor. A well written light read with plenty of surprises.
3,a good read,"This book by David Rosenfelt was a good read. The characters were likeable and comfortable to deal with and the plot was normal -- for awhile. Then it had a plot correction at the end which made it more interestng. Enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
4,"Enjoyable, quick read with some nice plot twists","This was my first David Rosenfelt book, but it won't be my last. He an engaging, witty writer. The story is light and fun, if a story with people getting killed left and right can be that.I like that while the storyline is relatively clean and easy to follow, it had quite a few plot turns - just as you think you know how it is going to end, it changes direction again.I like that he achieves plot twists without too much irrelevant complexity or too many bit part characters. I've been frustrated by authors lately who make their stories seem more 'interesting' than they are by throwing in all sorts of complete irrelevancies just cause.My only complaint about this book is that the lead character's jokes can get a bit tiresome. Oftentimes they are funny - and that's nice - but sometimes you just wish he'd skip the banter cause it isn't so funny.But that's a small price to pay and overall, this is a very solid effort and I will read more of his stories."
4,Great!!,"Another great one from Rosenfelt. I enjoyed his first two books more than this one, but still a wonderful entry into the Andy Carpenter series."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"After reading Mr. Rosenfelt's first two books, I couldn't wait to get this one. I enjoy the witty and humorous Andy Carpenter and his group of friends/co-workers. I read many legal thrillers and this is an enjoyable change. A good novel to read whether resting in the hammock or riding in the subway. I couldn't get enough and it was over before I knew it. What will Andy Carpenter's next adventure be?"
3,Andy Carpenter's goes to the dogs lovingly,"David Rosenfelt's Andy Carpenter is a familiar, comfortable character: Just wise-creacking enough to keep each novel entertaining, informative and current. What I enjoy is his inclusion of a variety of canine characters and that in each of his cases we know we are in for a fun ride at a higher caliber and faster pace each time. I always look forward to reading his next adventure."
1,One sided version of the story,"This book is biased, one-sided nonsense. If the British soldiers fired ""indiscriminately"" into the crowd then why were no women, children or old people killed? If you look at pictures of the crowd that day there were plenty of these present. The Paras were shot at by IRA snipers, attacked with acid bombs and incendiaries, and retaliated. Regretfully, some innocent men were killed in the crossfire. The allegation that the soldiers were a bunch of psychos who randomly shot at an unarmed peaceful demonstration is a lie."
5,"some of the best of Odetta, from the ""old days""","I have both original recordings, and love them. Odetta has a voice and style that has always impressed and moved me. She sings these songs with great respect for the music. Odetta is one of the true icons of folk and blues. When you listen to these songs, you will understand. Any one interested in the origins of folk, folk - rock, or any other folk hybred needs to have this collection. Buy one for a back up. My son's taste in music ussualy leans toword heavy metal, rap, and hip hop. However, when has listened to some of my Odetta and other folk greats, the recordings disappear to his house."
3,"Was a Good Light, 12 years ago!","I've had this brand light for about 12 years. It withstood a great amount of use in all weather conditions. It's final downfall was an angry wife, who ""chucked it"". Anyway, the only thing wrong is the cast frame that holds the lens and guard in place. I can get a replacement I think. I'll be getting another light soon. I've had several other work lights but none seemed as good as this one.UPDATE, After purchasing the new Bulldog worklight and using it for about two months, it's already broke. The rubber feet are gone and the hieght adjustment bolt for the feet has stripped out. The electrical cord is very hard and gets worse with cold weather. The top support for the light is very unstable and had to be retrofitted with a small bolt in order to sabilize it. Very dissatisfied! Apparently as with everything today, quality seems to dwindle. I do not reccommend this light anymore."
1,They used to be good,I have been buying these for years. It used to be I woul dget five plus years from a lite. It seems now it is less than a year.
5,Track listing,1. We Stand United2. Crucified3. Candyman Messiah4. Obsession5. I Cross the Rubicon6. Supernatural [1991 Remix]7. Ride the Bullet [1991 Remix]8. Say Goodbye to Babylon9. Flying High10. Walking with a Zombie11. My Army of Lovers
4,Massive Luxury Overdose,Massive Luxury Overdose being their 1992 release and their second studio album was also their most succesful with massive hits such as Crucified and Obsession. I remember when this album was released back in the early 90's when I was in my final year of highschool and I like it as much now as I did then. 4/5.
4,"the best song is ""Obsession""","the best song on this album is ""obsession"" i love the lyrics and the sounds of this song. the album is great but this song makes the album. i heard it about 6 yrs ago in high school and i fell in love with it. it is the bomb!"
3,Battycake Battcake Bakers Man,"I first heard Walking With A Zombie over the sound system at my local Crust N' Thrust. These guys kind of remind me of The Round, Circa 1973- the ribbon, the powdered faces. All fine and well if you're, you know... ...Or Swedish for that matter. However, if it's pure dub-informed mocha funk you're after, I'd recommend the last CD by Paul and Shirley Isaacs- more harmonies, truly warped basslines, a sense of humour, and an ethnic identity to boot. Drop this one in a sorority or a Combat 18 meeting, and you're bound to start some heads nodding. Army of Lovers just come on a little too strong, but if you like it dark and and black with a twist of Hendon, you can safely park your volvo on this hot piece of wax."
5,"An honest and ""open"" account of being gay (w/ a partner)","How refreshing to read something written about sharing a life with another man and all the funny situations this brings up. Not just because they are both men, but because living together can be ""funny"" in any situation. *One of my top 10 for 98""!!!*"
4,Laugh out Loud Funny,"If you have heard or read David Sedaris and liked him, my guess is you will really fall for Bob Smith. Funny and engrossing, this is a book to buy!"
4,A writer first and foremost...,"While Bob Smith's unique claim to fame is that he is a gay comedian who uses his sexual orientation as part of his act, this collection of essays demonstrates that it all begins with his intelligent, incisive writing. Some of his tales will make you laugh aloud. Others are more gentle (but never sentimental) and go to the heart of what it means to be an adult, partnered gay man in the '90s."
2,Very Disappointed,This exercise video has a few negatives that make me give it less than a favorable review:1. Outdated.2. Transitions are too quick and verbal cues too fast for an elder person with limited mobility and/or cognition to follow.3. No adapted exercises shown or discussed.4. Tested video with a group of 12 senior citizens with limited mobility due to arthritis and most did not like the speed or format of the exerise program.
3,This may help you IF...,...you can stand the boring format and British accent of the woman speaking. I found this product too annoying to be able to fully reap any benefits.
2,Suspense CD,"Although the quality of the CD set was fine, I was disappointed to find only 9 stories in this collection. I was expecting more episodes for the price. For value, it is better to buy Suspense stories on audio-cassette."
5,Useful Information About Unusual Topics,"At one time or another I am sure all of us have wondered, at least once, how you would go about buying an elephant. Well after reading this book you will know exactly how to make such a purchase should you be so inclined. This book is actually a collection of articles on various subjects and while most were written in the 1800s there are some articles as recent as the 1970s and all of them are highly enjoyable. Among other useful skills you will learn how to signal a crane, fly a plane (at least a 1917 version) and cast a statue. The social etiquette articles are particularly interesting as they provide a window into our ancestors views on such subjects as how to shake hands and whom and when to marry. While many of these articles must be taken with a grain of salt they are all quite enjoyable."
4,Good Diapers,"I have used Huggies and Pampers. Pampers is the only diaper I have found in this size, so therefore it's the best. They do the job well, except at night. Almost every single morning my 2 year old wakes up either wet or soaking wet. Sometimes it's the middle of the night. (I have a fun time stripping him of all his clothes, changing him and changing the sheets at 3 AM.) I have tried other ""nighttime diapers"" and pull ups and they are no better, so it must be my son."
3,Size 7 very similar to size 6,"I read these mixed customer reviews before purchasing, but I went ahead and ordered anyway because I was desperate and figured I could use the size 7s even if they are the same as size 6, as some reviews suggest.In my opinion, the 7s are almost identical to size 6. Maybe they're a teeny tiny bit roomier around the thighs, hard to say, but definitely no larger around the waist. My daughter weighs 39 pounds (one pound less the bottom of the suggested range for size 7) but they barely fit around her waist. It seems really odd to introduce a new size that isn't really a new size. I don't get it. Especially when there's a definite need out there for size 7.I have not had any issues with the side tabs coming undone as others have mentioned."
4,reviewing,I would like to know why this item was replaced by size 6... I would prefer size 7 cruisers...please advise...thank you....
4,Pampers is the only size seven,"No parent wants to have to buy a diaper in a size seven, but when you're the parent of child with special needs it is helpful to know they're available. Typically purchasing these on Amazon is cheaper than diapers.com, but the negative side to that is you will wait for the product much longer. Every time I have ordered these from amazon they take three times as long to ship as on diapers.com I have never had that issue with any of my other amazon orders, and I do purchase from here pretty regularly. So you have to choose-- do you want to save on money, or time? But the product itself is great. I wish they were available in more stores."
3,Not much bigger than a 6,The length of the diaper is a little longer than a 6 but the waist is barely bigger. They claim it is good for 41 plus pounds but that is not true. Our little one is almost 35 pounds and we are already searching for a larger diaper as he is very tall (wears 6 - 8 clothing). If your size 6 has become too small these will work for a little while but start searching for a youth diaper soon so you have a back up just in case. Our little one does stay dry through the night with these. We change him about midnight and he wakes about 8 - 9 am. Hope that helps.
5,Great diaper to spoil our son,"We are very happy that Pampers decide to produce a diaper in size 7.Our son love it to wear at home a diaper, because he don`t want to stop playing for using the toilet.Insted want his diaper to handle pee and his cookies. In his bulky diaper he feels very comfy and happy.The diapers Size 6 became very small, now he has enough space for 1 Year more diapertime.Thank you for the great new product."
1,Unsatisfied Customer,I was unsatisfied with the Pampers Cruisers Size 7 since they weren't much larger than Size 6. I would recommend to parents to save their money and buy size 6.
1,Way too long to wait for Diapers for my special needs daughter.,"I ordered the Pampers Size 7 diapers for my 7.5 year old Special Needs daughter that is not yet potty trained. I have ordered her diapers Size 7 through amazon for some time now, because it is hard to find over Size 6 in the stores. So this has become one of my only options. The diapers have usually arrived in a timely fashion...2-4 days.This time I ordered her the same case of diapers on December 5th and it now Monday night Dec.13th and I still have NOT received them. (I had to go buy size 6 at the store just to get us through) This has been way too long, I feel you should cover the cost. I will wait to hear from you."
1,DO NOT BUY DRY-MAX!!,"Along with our daughter, SEVERAL moms in my moms club have notified all of us of the severe reactions that their children are having since using the Dry Max diapers.My daughter has never had sensitive skin, so I figured they were probably over-reacting and went ahead and bought the diapers anyway. Boy was that a mistake. My poor daughter paid for that mistake for weeks, as did we. She had the horrible sores, etc. that everyone else was mentioning.Do NOT buy dry-max diapers.I am sorely disappointed that Amazon isn't offering the Pampers Cruisers Size 7, without the drymax anymore. We'll have to shop elsewhere, now. :("
5,Great for teen baby,"Im finally happy they came out with a diaper that fits a person with infantilism (teen baby) great fit and im happy as ever. now i dont have to buy those adult fitted breifs and can have elmo on my diaper. People dont understand that just like diabetes or another illness, this helps us out alot thank you amazon"
1,nicht wirklich größer als Size 6! :(((,"Leider ist die Größe 7 von Pampers nicht wirklich größer als die hier in Europa angebotene Größe 6. Sie ist, was das Saugvlies betrifft, eher schmaler und dünner.Welche Alternativen bieten sich den Eltern von einnässenden Schulkindern?Z.B. eine zusätzliche Vlieswindel mit in die Pampers legen und ggf. ein Gummihöschen drüber -- besonders dann, wenn sich die Verschlüsse aufgrund des gewachsenen Kinderkörpers nicht mehr schließen lassen. Ist vielleicht nicht die Ideallösung, aber allemal besser als dem P&G-Konzern; für eine minderwertige Windel (Gr. 7) das Geld in den Rachen zu schieben."
5,Glad to see a bigger size diaper! Finally!!,"I'm glad that Pampers come out with a bigger size diaper,finally! I'm in the new Pampers Cruisers size 7 diapers. (due to a bladder control problem.) They fit better and work great!! Thank-you Proctor and Gamble for the new bigger size diapers...Pampers Cruisers size 7!!!!!"
5,Best Mountain Bike DVD Yet....,"I have been into MNT Biking for years now, and was looking for a MNT Bike DVD that captured the spirit, and soul of the sport. I have finally found that DVD. The Collective, has the best videoography of any of the MNT Biking dvds out there. The thing I like most about it, is that it captures many of the styles, like Freeriding, Urban, singletrack, etc..Another Collective DVD is coming out in April, called ROAM. I highly recommend The Collective, and also pick up ROAM when it comes out. You cant go wrong with The Collective. Get it, get them both...."
4,Blackwell's Compendium on the Russian Revolution ...,"A good general look at events, personalities and chronology of the Russian Revolutions. An excellent reference work for general students of this era."
1,Horrible Purchase,"The Shelves do not line up. The wood looks horrible, I would not use this stand in my garage. Worst product I have purchased on Amazon.Do Not buy a Winsome Furniture Product"
1,Terrible item,"This is a piece of crap. I wish we would have read the other reviews first. Finish is nasty, holes don't line up and parts are backward. DO NOT buy!"
1,table for large tv.,"A Major Disappointment! This product is very inferior quality. On three pieces the wood is split along the edge,plus the front of one drawer. Directions for assembly were very poor.Two corners on the top of It were mashed in. It appears that the item had been returned and resold. We are keeping it because it would be a major inconvenience to repack it and return."
1,Waste of money,"This item arrived damaged from the factory, not in shipping. The finish was rough and uneven and the top had a broken corner. Upon assembly it was one screw short, luckily I had one that worked. It is the perfect size, color and style I was looking for, but this is going to be a yard sale item, hoping to get at least some of my money back. The company offered for me to return it, but wanted it returned in the original shipping box with all original packing material. There was no way I could get it back in that box with all the packing material as they required. (ever try to reuse styrofoam?) So I am stuck with something I paid good money for and can't use. Very disappointed with this item."
5,"Satisfying Action, Long Awaited","Since discovering C.J. Cherryh's novels about the -atevi-, I've waited several years for PRECURSOR, and I'm delighted to say it was worth the wait.Cherryh has a gift for combining breathless and sinister power politics and intricate plotting with a dry, unexpected wit that blindsides you and makes even readers familiar with her tactics laugh out loud. I count myself experienced in the ways of CJ's aliens, but this time, she startled me but good. (The people on the E train are USED to people letting out whoops of glee during rush hour, right? Oh well, they'll get over it.)To borrow -atevi- speech constructions, I can only say that one will prove indecorously impatient for the next installment."
5,"solid follow-up to original series, but too short ;)","Upon consideration, even some niggling doubts aren't enough to downgrade my review from ""Smashing!"". PRECURSOR lacks something, but only when compared head-on to FOREIGNER; considering the incredibly tough act this installment has to follow, I'm happy enough with it ;) . My only substantial complaint is an overall feeling of this volume being the set-up for a later payoff which we have to wait for; it's a ripping political thriller in itself, but it definitely leaves the reader starving for more. I only hope that the subsequent volumes can deliver on these promises with the same energy and followthrough that INVADER and INHERITOR managed to bring to the storyline of the first volume."
4,A felicitous addition,A welcome addition to the series. Just as enjoyable as the previous atevi world books without being repetitious. Gets into the action quickly and keeps the adventure going. I like the word and page economy.
5,"A ""must"" for all C.J. Cherry fans!","Precursor is recommended for prior fans of the Foreigner trilogy, who will appreciate having a sequel which covers the years since the reappearance of the starship Phoenix. Political balances are changed by the starship's appearance, and new challenges between aliens and humans arise as a result."
5,For Sci-Fi fans,"The best way to read this book is in its proper place in the series as they constantly refer to information found in earlier volumes, but are a good read any way.I purchased these to ""fill out"" the series, as I was missing these volumes."
5,One of Foreigner's best,"""Precursor"" symbolizes everything that I admire in Ms. Cherryh's writing. Simply put, being the fourth novel in the Foreigner series,""Precursor"" has all of the ambition and intrigue displayed in the earlier novels. It doesn't rehash what's already been established but instead takes the plot in a new and creditable direction. That's what I like about Cherryh, she doesn't drag her series into the grave with unnecessary additions. It leaves me secure in knowing that when I buy one of her novels, it is money well spent."
5,"If you're a fan, you'll have read this. If not, you lose.",Another book in one of C.J.Cherryh's great SF series. Start at the beginning and enjoy the adventures of one lone human acting as a liason between humans and a very alien-thinking race. Great study in diverse cultures and philosophies attempting to co-exist with each other.
4,Designing a database : get this book!,"Easy to read and communicates years of db theory in practical, easy-to-digest chapters.This is not a how-to reference for database applications. And because it isn't written for any particular software, that makes it an invaluable design reference. SQL, Access, Oracle, whatever-- this book focuses on solid, proven design and not on the latest, coolest, widget.If you are considering a database, for whatever platform, for whatever project, be sure to grab this book."
4,Solid introduction to databases; excellent value for money,"I used the book as a self-study guide to help understand the essence of databases....the book delivers on what it promises. I would not recommend this book to a serious student what wants to learn how to program databases (it could complement more extensive books). However, for someone who needs to understand the database world at a technical level of detail (e.g., be an intelligent collaborator with database specialists rather than a manager), the book is a useful and solid introduction. There is little extraneous material or discussions to distract, and the book's small size makes it easy to stuff into a briefcase and read on airplanes."
4,Excellent introduction to databases!,"I teach databases to people with very different backgrounds. This book, although it looks a bit thin for such a large field of study as databases, gives almost everyone a very good, and a surprisingly thorough introduction.It is correct, clear and well structured, with good examples and exercises. If you have some academic experience, it will do well for self-studying. Databases is not a light subject. It is not something you get to grips with without going through some rather heavy theory.Rolland tells you what you need to know, without complicating things, and without oversimplifying important but rather technical details."
4,Antiquated but Useful,"Interesting book in understanding humor in an intellectual manner. Quite antiquated, but nevertheless useful."
3,I made a mistake,I finally figured out I needed a HMDI cable to get PIP. None of the emails I sent to Samsung help told me that. Sorry. It is a beautiful white cabinet and so far all is good.
3,NO PIP,I selected this model because it promised PIP. It does not display PIP from a VCR or DVD player. I don't know how they can promise PIP. These reviews were helpful to me so I felt I should share my opinion also. It does have a beautiful white case and is light enough to lift and move around.
5,GREAT STORY,"Stanley Maxwell's book left me to ponder on how many people have gone through the same or worst experiences than this one, and still have the faith to believe in Jesus. This is a great book that every Christian should read. Maxwell uses various sources to write this story and adds flavor to the story by translating Chinesse espression literally into the inglish language.If this incredible story of faith and courage doesn't leave you pondering then I don't know what will. This is a story that both Christians and non-Christians should read. Amaizing, incredible."
4,Perfect for Beginning Romance Writers,"This book is excellent for providing the basics for romance writing, including the fact that there are several types of romances, and it points out that there is literally a recipe for romances, which helps one to write something that would be publishable. I purchased this book on the recommendation of another book on writing. I recommend this book for those writers just getting into the genre of romances."
4,A warm book with a sweet ending,"Many regencies follow a format that this book does not follow. The heroine actually has some backbone, traveling with army in the war. Not typical for a regency. And the hero has amazing feet of clay. He falls in love with a woman who is far from ball rooms and silk gowns. A woman caught in a terrible and strained marriage torn by abuse and alcholism. It is a very sweet love story as they both bravely struggle through the grim reality of the war together. The story leaves you wanting to more, and you are sorry when the last page is turned."
4,A Book Worth Buying!!,"From the back cover:WITHOUT HONOR, THERE IS NOTHING...So Kit Montgomery, Lord St. John, had been taught since the cradle, yet his soul whispered there was something more. Something that made him long to look into the haunted depths of Judith Haviland's gaze and offer comfort, long before he had the right...Though he had comforted Judith in the darkest hours of her late husband's abuse, Lord St. John's kind regard had never once gone beyond the bounds of friendship. Even now, his offer of marriage was meant only to preserve her honor. Yet could she marry him to stop the rumors that only told the truth of what was in her heart?Don't stop here, go buy it!"
2,Get the titles right!,"I've read so far four of Gayle Wilson's regencies and enjoyed them. However, this story was irritating because for some reason the titles were all wrong. Firstly, Kit's father is the Earl of Ryde, yet Kit, a younger son is a Lord? Younger sons are only lords if their fathers are dukes and maybe marquesses (not sure of the latter though). The younger son of an earl would be an Honourable Mr. Also, even if Kit's father was a duke (he has a ducal ring in the book!) his proper title as a younger son would be Lord Christopher Montgomery (Montgomery being the family name) not Lord St.John. He wouldn't even be Lord Montgomery, as younger sons are not lords in their own right, it merely being a courtesy title."
5,Please read review of 32OZ size,Please read my review of the 32oz size to know how great this product is.Thank You
4,mixed feelings,"while some of the fight scenes were totally right on, some were so poorly faked...well, overall its worth the watch despite this. i bought it"
3,Poor Video Quality BUT Great Movie,"A great movie whose original version was superb.One of the all-time great kung fu movies.This DVD has very poor sound, and poor video quality.Quite a disappointment, but was the only one availableat that time.Sold by: cdigitalvDoes anyone know where the original may be available."
4,Best Buy for Color Negative Film Scans,"Unless you are prepared to spend $2500+ for a film scanner, the Dimage Scan Elite is the ideal choice for 35mm scans of color negative film. The Scan Elite produces much better tonal range from negative films than the Nikon offerings (although Nikon does a better job on slide scans). The SCSI interface is adequate for transferring huge files up to 45Mb. And the digital ice software is convenient for occasional scratched negative.There are some compromises to contend with: the bundled software is mediocre, but many prefer Vuescan software which offers much more functionality for film scanning. Minolta is not going to release a OS X compatible driver, and the scan speed is much slower than the manufacturer specs in multiscan mode which is essential to minimize channel noise. However these are reasonable tradeoffs for the reasonable price point of the Dimage and outstanding 8x10 to 11x14 color prints which result from a good scan."
2,I found this to be a waste of money and time...,"This is a very weak documentary. I was very disappointed. There was no dramatization, so it was very boring. I'm pleased that this guy turned his life around, but I would have rather seen more enactments of the events, not just monotone story telling."
2,"Does not charge the iPod when plugged into computer, only transfers data","This cable transfers data, but it does not charge the iPod when plugged into your computer. If you want to charge your iPod using this cable it is possible, but you'll need to shell out an additional $29.99 for theApple iPod USB Power Adapter. USB 2.0 data transfer works and the speed is comparable to firewire, so it does perform that function, but I don't understand why it doesn't charge when they make other USB cables that do! Lame.If you have a PC, I'd recommend getting a firewire card for your computer and using that for data transfer & charging. I was doing that, but ran out of card slots and had to swap out my firewire card for another card - hence buying this cable. But this cable was disappointing."
2,Working but very slowly.,It charges my iPad2 but very slowly. It takes a whole day to charge 50% battery level and I can see the batter level drops while I am using it with the power plug in.
1,A real P.O.S.,"The cable LOOKS like an Apple product. The packaging LOOKS like an Apple product. But make no mistake, this is NOT an Apple product. (They probably spent more on the packaging than manufacturing the cable.)When this cable arrived I tried to charge my iPod. It kept turning on and off. Then I noticed that it had knocked out all the USB devices hooked into my computer--keyboard, mouse and Wacom tablet. I had to hard reboot to restart the computer. After the computer restarted everything worked until I plugged the cable in then all of the devices went dead again.Worried about permanently damaging my Mac, I threw the cable in the garbage and bought a genuine Apple cable.Don't waste your money on this inferior quality, Chinese knock-off P.O.S. You will ony have to replace it. Save yourself the trouble."
4,Cheap and Speedy,I was in desperate need of a new charging chord for my ipod touch. my old one had been wearing out and it finally fell apart. This chord was very inexpensive and worked phenomenally. I have been using it for about a year now and I just can't believe that it still looks and works like new! It arrived on time and fairly packaged. Would definitely buy from this seller again and refer them to friend and family.
2,Not worth it,This product is awful. It wont even plug into your device without a struggle. Bottom line don't waste your money!!
1,I piece of junk,"Didn't work at all, matter of fact it almost destroy my IPad, thank God for the iCloud. The seller wanted me to return it but it would cost to much to send it back because they don't pay the shipping. If you have a IPhone, iPad please stay away fom this fake."
1,Doesn't Work at All,"Bought this as a replacement for my sons iPod touch. The PC I used it on doesn't even recognize it. I used the same PC I had with his original cord. It's a Windows 7 PC so it has nothing to do with the operating system.Also tried using it with the wall outlet adapter. The iPod wouldn't even take a charge!The cord itself is very thin (thinner than the original that came with the iPod). The plug that goes into the iPod also doesn't connect securely. It tends to wiggle around in the port. Even trying to hold it tight for a connection didn't work.Unfortunately, it is just an inferior imitation and of poor quality. I don't expect much for the price, but I would at least expect it to do what it is supposed to do."
2,"Not apple, and not reliable","Pros: I spent very little to experiment with this product, compared to an apple store bought itemCons: It's utter nonsense. This is not an apple product, and of the two I ordered, only one works...and only on my 3DS, my ipad and iphone 4 did not connect to a computer."
1,I can not review something I have not recieved yet,I ordered Step by Step from book logic usa in Dec.I`am still waiting. They have lost my future businessZoe
2,not very useful,"The layout of the book is quite terrible. There are two parts to the book; the first part is lessons and exercises, and the second part is grammar. To a newbie, Part I makes no sense at all. One has to read a number of pages in Part II before one can work on Part I. Also, the explanations are terse and unclear. While it might make a passable reference book, I would not recommend it as the starting point of one's study of Ancient Greek--even though I haven't read any other learn-greek books, I am certain good ones exists; this book is just not one of those.Addendum: I have since purchased ""Teach Yourself Ancient Greek"" and I find it to be a much better self-study book."
1,Not so Good Paper Bear,Not impressed with this bear. It was very flimsy. The outside was like a fed ex floppy envelope. We bought a few for party favors and none of the kids seemed interested. Save your money and get a coloring book.
2,"Good songs , but need a more polished performe","got this album for my brother...Have always liked Robbins as a writer, but his vocals are uneven....Even though this is a studio albem"
3,"Attractive on the outside, but not very substantive.","I purchased this book for 2 eleven year old nieces because I liked the whimsical cover. You're only able to view a few pages before purchase, and they seemed ok; but in actuality, the inside artwork is not very attractive or inspiring, and the questions are too broad for the 9 to 11 age group. It is 128 pages and 9 x 7.1 x 0.4 inches, which is too big and heavy for a child to carry around. It was pubished in 2004; I think writers (probably including this one) and educators have developed more interesting, provocative, and creative journals since then."
4,My daughter likes it,"My 11-year-old daughter likes to write, but she doesn't always know what to write, so this book is fun for her. It sparks creativity. It has mostly good questions, and enough room to write, but not too much. THe only criticism we have is that some of the illustrations are cartoony and unlovely. We like beautiful pictures."
5,Great first journal,I purchased this book for my stepdaughter's 10th birthday. She is a great kid but has a few struggles with emotions and worrying related to her parents divorce. My stepdaughter is very creative so I purchased this in hopes it could be a tool to work out her feelings but also encourage her writing skills.
2,"Good if You're Totally Stuck, But is That What a Journal's About?","If you truly don't know what to write about, turn to this. But other than that, I don't see why anyone would want it. To me, a journal is a place to write down your thoughts, feelings, memories, and just things you feel like writing. If you can only write about what the page you're on says to write about, what's the point? As a very wise person once told me, the only reason you should write is if there's something in your heart you need to express."
4,Grandaughter liked it,My nine-year-old grandaughter who has some natural writing and drawing talents really liked the book and kept going back to it to enter her thoughts. The guide questions are good and surely appealed to her artistic nature.
4,Pleased with purchase,"I purchased these socks to avoid paying for shipping and handling on another product purchased from this company. The socks are mostly cotton and good quality. I was especially pleased that they did not have a heavy seam across the toes that can be very uncomfortable for those of us with arthritic toes. Also, socks without that heavy seam can be very difficult to find. If they were a little thicker they would be perfect and I would purchase more as I like thicker socks with my athletic shoes. These are a very nice dress sock."
1,Terrible!,These are horrible socks! They're those kind of socks that stretch out beyond belief and then fall down and creep their way past your heels. Half of the sock was under my foot within a couple of hours. DO NOT BUY!!
3,Not as soft as I thought that they were going to be,"I ordered these socks thinking from the description that they would be extra soft and comfortable, but they're not. They're comfortable but not really comfortable the way I wanted them to be. Due to a past bad case of plantar fasciitis and fibromyalgia, my feet are really sensitive about the socks I am wearing and am always on the lookout for socks that said to be soft. They actually were more like some cheap socks I bought elsewhere (before I had foot issues) that I never liked very much."
5,Great Intro Level Book,This book features wonderful photography and is a great starter book for Southern California Bird Watchers. I started using it about a year ago and was happy to find 90% of the birds in my backyard could be easily identified in this book. It also features helpful descriptions and maps. Happy birdwatching!
