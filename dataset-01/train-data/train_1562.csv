5,Great product for price,Love this pasta maker. It is the perfect size for me and it is very easy to use. Will be looking into purchasing additional attachments.
3,fastening clamp handle broke,I have owned this machine for around 3 years and just be aware of the plastic handle on the C-clamp that attaches it to the counter/table. From repeated use the plastic handle broke. I am sure I can find some work-around option at the hardware store. The handle/crank for turning the rollers does tend to not stay put as mentioned by many other reviewers. If I had to do it over again I would spend a few more dollars and get all metal construction and a machine that has more cutter options already included.I do love how quickly I can have homemade noodles done when making soup.
4,Straight forward and easy to use,"Ths pasta machine is very straight forward and easy to use. I did spend the extra time to clean it thoroughly as directed before I made my first 'batch' of fettucini. I had no problems at all. It was a bit awkward at first to figure out how to hold and crank at the same time, but I eventually figured it out. Now it's a breeze! If you want to see if you would enjoy making your own pasta, this machine would be perfect for you."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"After looking for a pasta maker at every local store and not finding one, I decided to look online. When I found this item, the price was right and Amazon offered free shipping, so I ordered it. The machine does everything it claims to and is very easy to assemble. It's not very large so was very easy to find a place for it in my kitchen. Figuring out how much dough to use took a little practice but once I figured it out, it was super easy. The recipes are easy to follow but there aren't very many of them. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the handle tends to fall out while using the machine. This is a little frustrating but workable considering the price. All in all, I'm quite satisfied with my 1st Amazon.com purchase."
5,great little pasta machine,I am very happy with my new pasta machine which I purchased at Amazon.com for working with polymer clay. Works very well and does a good job of making the clay pliable and ready to make into artwork. I makes my job much easier than rolling the clay out by hand; it also makesthe clay ready to blend.
4,Nice pasta rolling machine,"I haven't had this very long but I've already used it to make flat pasta for home made ravioli. It worked well...rolling the pasta out as thin or thick as I wanted it. I haven't used it yet for fettucini but the flat sheets came out great for ravioli. Since I have an old kitchen with an old counter, I wasn't able to attach it to the counter. I had to use my kitchen table. No problem...it still works, but I'd rather use it on the counter."
3,Could be better,"I got this to use with clay.It does get the job done and i likethe 9 adjustable settings, however it definately could be better. For one thing, the handle constantly falls out while you are trying to turn it, as there is no way to secure it. Also, the handle is so large, that in order to turn it the machine must be off the table(or else it would hit the table and you would ot be able to turn it."
1,Silly Engineering Mistake,"The engineers who designed this product really messed up. They situated the shallow C-clamp on the same side as the roller crank which makes the opposite end flap up off the board or table every time you turn the crank. You need to use both hands in the rolling process. Unless you have a helper, the flapping must be tolerated. It's irritating and severe enough to loosen the clamp. That was rather dingy!"
1,poor quality product,"It broke at my third use. the quality is poor and don't recommend it. I fixed it, and other part broke after that."
1,Gears failed after one use.,"Gears failed after one use. They are very poorly made, the metal used in the gears is of poor quality, the design is poor. Bottom line, this looks good on the outside but look under the cover and you will find that it is no good."
1,"Cheaply made, poorly designed piece of junk","First problem, the C-clamp was too small to clamp on to any counter in my house (by about 1/4 of an inch). Looking at how the c-clamp was designed to attach to the machine looks very flaky and unreliable anyway. So I used one of my own c-clamps.Next problem, the gear jammed almost immediately on the first use. I took the device apart and found two gear teeth bent together forming a single gear tooth, lots of scoring all around the gears and metal filing everywhere. I'm pretty sure it was broken out of the box, and just became more unusable as it went along. The gear design has very loose, wide gaps between the teeth, definitely not a precision machine design. I would guess even if this was working out of the box, it wouldn't last very long.Also, the handle falls out very easily, and the upward part of the rotation tends to slide the pasta cutter out of it's mount.Save your money, don't buy this piece of junk."
1,Cutter attachment broke,"The cutter attachment broke after making pasta just 4 or 5 times. The roller still works, at least. Just counting the days until that breaks as well... I really wish i bought a more quality machine. Also, the crank constantly falls out. no good."
3,Ok for the price,"This hand crank machine does make nice pasta, however, on my machine I find that I have to hold the tension adjuster while I'm thinning out the pasta sheets because it does not lock in place. This machine would work a lot better if the tension dial actually locked into the designated thicknesses (1-7). I found it highly annoying and awkward to have to hold that dial to keep at thickness 3 or 2 or whatever. Having to hold that dial also made it awkward to actually crank the machine as I didn't have an extra to adjust the pasta if necessary. Overall, if you have the strength to hold that tension dial while you crank, it does turn out decent pasta and the pasta cutters work beautifully. I do wish I had shopped around a little more and gotten a better quality one with a locking tension adjustment."
1,I really do not like this,I really do not like this product. It's very difficult to use. It would not flatten my dough. Never again.
1,cheap gears,"I stripped the gears (for the rollers, not cutters) on this on the 3rd use. Total waste of my money. I know how to make pasta and use a pasta machine, if wimpy arms like mine can strip the gears, so can you. In good faith I called Pragotrade/ Weston to see if I could order new a gear but they will not sell them separately (I like fixing things instead of throwing them out).Lesson: save the receipt or buy a more reputable brand, these are cheaply constructed."
1,Broke after a few months of use,It appears as though I stripped the gears after using for a month or two. Worked great at first but didn't last. Had to throw the whole thing away. I recommend a higher quality machine.
1,Gear broke the very first time using it,"Received the pasta machine fairly quickly and we put it to use the day it arrived, within minutes of using it one of the gears broke. It worked nicely for the first few cranks. Most likely a flaw from the factory but not worth the hassle to return. Will buy a little higher quality machine next time around."
1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, WILL BREAK!!!!","go figure, just days after the 30 days to return it the size setting for rolling the dough BROKE and i could not use 7 or 6, had to start on 5. now months later i can only use 1, 2, and 3 sizes!!!!! i just threw this pile of garbage in my recycles. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, GO BUY THE KITCHENAID WHICH IS NOW WHAT I'M DOING."
3,Not bad..,"Not bad overall but can only make large or small pasta thickness,, but no in between. Also its difficult to clamp down if your counter or tabletop isn't just the right thickness and angle."
1,oil or flaking all over dough and horribly difficult to use.,"Position didn't hold, oil got all over the dough. Attempted to clean and failed. I didn't disassemble (if that's possible). It didn't hold to the counter well and simply didn't seem to work well even if the oil hadn't been an issue. Thirty days expired before I first used it. Oops. it was tossed."
1,Spaghetti cutter fails to cut spaghetti,"The non-cutting rollers worked fine for me; they did not ship with grease on them and they behave as other pasta machines I've used. The fettuccine cutters work fine. The spaghetti cutters, however, fail to cut spaghetti. Instead, they leave me with a semi-perforated mess that I have to manually separate out, if even possible.As far as I'm concerned, that makes my machine defective."
1,Cheap!,"This pasta machine is very poorly constructed. Don't be lured into buying this one based on the price, spend the extra $ and get one that is better constructed. Fortunately Amazon has a good return policy!"
3,Fine,"This is a great product for someone who will not be regularly making pasta. But, if you will use often tgen get something better. It is not so durable and begins to fall apart after only a few uses"
1,1 and done,"I had this exact same machine before, same box, same picture, same name, it worked very well, for a year. I bought this one after I forgot the old one when I moved cross country. This one arrived and I made some pasta with it right away. You can tell its a bit cheap. Heaviness does not equal quality! It worked well the first time. Today I went to use it, rolled out my first sheet of pasta and it started to stick. After it stuck some of it got lodged under one of the small knives that scrapes the rollers. This small piece then bent this little knife which then just snowballed and bent it more when I rolled the pasta out. I managed to get the little metal knife out to try and bend it back, no go, it looks like unless it's perfectly straight it will just get more and more dough caught in it. Let me finish by saying I am a professional chef, I have used so many other machines and this one is by far the cheapest! Spend the extra and buy an Atlas or some other good Italian made brand."
5,Cute!,"On looks alone, I love it.Previous reviews about the handle falling out--get a grip.This thing is a bundle of energy in my kitchen. I am hooked.thx, Amazon"
2,Go seek something else,"It was ok at first. After about 10 uses, some screw loosened. I could heard the rattling part when I shake the machine but couldn't get it out. At the mean time, a roller dis-aligned so the sheet had one side thicker than the other side. I gave up and tossed it."
1,Poor Quality/Poor Customer Service,"This pasta machine is poorly consructed. It does not attach to the counter securely. It does not pull the dough through the machine smoothly, regardless of the setting. Make pasta the old-fashioned way...by hand.Roma 6 Inch Traditional Style Pasta Machine"
1,not worth of the money,a very basic pasta machine. the cutter didn't cut through the pasta. need time to seperated them one by one. never used it after the second try.
1,buy another brand,This piece is pretty weak. I have used other Chinese made pieces and they are far better than this unit.
5,attention please the machine is broken,the machine was broken graduating buttonRoma 6 Inch Traditional Style Pasta Machinethe machine is goog but I ONLY USE IT 3 TIMES AND BROKE THE BUTTON AND I CAN DO PLEASE
3,Not sure how I like this thing,"I was very excited to try on my new tablet sleeve for my Thinkpad X61 Tablet, and am kind of disappointed so far. It DOES fit like a glove, but it's so tight that it can be a royal pain to get in and out of the case. I figured I could use it as a normal case, out of tablet mode, but it seems that will be too much of a hassle. Also, although it protects the screen, the plastic cover doesn't feel close to as good to write on as the screen itself. One more annoyance is the zipper goes around 2 sides (basically a corner), which makes the opening extremely tight to squeeze the tablet in. If it were even 2 and a HALF sides (2 corners), it would slide right in, but with this design it's just plain aggravating.Overall, I'd say this thing is nice, I just don't see myself using it as often as I had intended to. Hope this helps."
2,"Inconsistent quality, lousy design.","Length:: 4:08 MinsI have about 30 of these currently in use by our sales team. As you can see in the video, I'm not very happy with the construction quality of these tablet sleeves nor with how well they have held up to use. I'm presently trying out the Targus bags (which I also reviewed)Targus Notebook Carrying Backpack (TBS008US)"
3,The Funny Side of How Non-Texans Think We Sound,This is an attempt to make fun of How Texans pronounce typical words by a Fellow Texan. Even a Texan will have trouble using these pronunciations and not laughing at himself. Fun and exciting. Good photography and facial expressions.
1,Dated,"This book is very dated and I didn't find it funny at all. I was going to give it to my nephew when he moved recently to Texas, but I threw it away instead."
5,Best Chocolate Ever,"I got this chocolate at Whole Foods. I absolutely LOVE it. I was sad bc there isn't a Whole Foods where I live, but they are on Amazon! Yayy!! I highly recommend this chocolate. I try and eat vegan, gluten-free, and soy-free so this is PERFECT! <3 <3 <3 I don't know how it is so good, but it is! :D"
3,Very realistic...maybe a little too much so !!!,"Our grandson is almost 3 and loves to play kitchen. So Grandma bought him this adorable blender. It works just like the real one. And he absolutely loved it. BUT it is so loud. And he played with it constantly for an hour or more. Finally, we had to put it away to give everyone's ears a rest. It is a very cute toy but the volume of the whirring sound it just too loud. Otherwise a great fun toy."
1,Batteries get wet!!!!,"I am amazed that no one's mentioned that the liquid in the blender oozes out of the top (where the ""blade"" attaches to the bottom of the blender). It drips down into the battery compartment within minutes of operation!! I have to take the batteries out & dry them after each brief use.If I'd have known that, I'd only have gotten the mixer where the batteries are not in the bottom of the mixer but under the top of the mixer, where they're pretty safe from getting wet."
1,Does not work!,I bought this for my daughter for xmas and when it came it didn't work. We sent it back and the replacement also did not work. Don't waste your time.
1,"It's really cute, but for a bigger kid","I think this toy would be a great addition to a child's play kitchen. However, it is lightweight and not going to hold up to multiple kids, or crashes to the floor. It's made of light weight plastic. It's a little pricey for what you can get at family dollar, and not as big. Very small, and cheaply made. I would say pass on this one.I suggest older kids ( ages 5 and up), or limited play, since if your child is anything like mine, they will be crashing this down to the floor, and it will NOT take the impact."
3,she likes it,"Our daughter likes it so far. she uses it in her little kitchen, and is fond of throwing just about anything in it! Sometimes there is a jam and you can hear the motor whining so best if you can be around to stop it (and remove the item) or teach your child to do it."
1,not worth a peny,"I bought this toy for my son thinking he would have a lot of fun. The day the toy arrived I put new batteries and was very disapointing to see that it did not work. It made a lot of noise, but the little plastic part did not spin. I read many bad reviews about this toy, but I was sttuborn enough to buy it even though. I think I believed it would not happen to me. Well, it did. Not worth the risk."
3,Noisy,"Just got this yesterday, my kids love it but it is extremely noisy. Its impossible to talk over the noise of the motor."
2,"I think I could have made this CD by hitting ""repeat"".","My two parakeets seem to enjoy this CD a bit, but if you want a CD for relaxing listening, be prepared to be irritated. I tried to go to sleep listening to it one night. I had to turn it off because it just got on my nerves.....I kept thinking it was stuck....like a record stuck in a grrove. It sometimes seems they recorded it by just hitting the ""repeat"" button on a couple of bird sounds. I think I could have done that. I'm just glad it didn't cost a lot, but now I can see why. Sorry for such a bad review, but I just had to tell anyone planning on buying it. I now just play it for my birds when I am NOT in the room."
2,Are they real?,"I bought this CD about a year ago, since I was curious about the nature sound CD craze, and it was cheap.(cheep? sorry...) For the price, it's probably worth it. However, some of the birds sound suspiciously like sounds I've heard coming out of my computer...Hence the title of this review. ;)"
3,OK bird sounds,"While this is not my favorite bird cd, its still good. No interrupting narration on this one, just bird sounds. I will still play it from time to time. Nothing stands out on this one or was special. But just bird sounds were good."
1,Magnet Set Failed Me!,Wow! How am I supposed to properly educate my son on his career choice as a drug dealer when the magnet set he uses to study with includes a cell phone and felony-weight cocaine?!?! The Bradley Brothers must be undercover police.
1,Crude Work,I am shocked. The work pictured in this magazine is crude and very ugly. I am trying to figure out how to cancel this so I don't have to look at the disgusting covers in future. They are horrid.
1,BAD NEWS,"been over2 mo. an still no magazine you tell me what you think,BAD NEWS to say the least. andy vodilko"
5,great mic,"I have used audio technica for the last 15 years, My first mic lasted for 10 years with almost daily use! It is easy to set up and the sound quality is great. I highly recommend this microphone."
3,This product seemed to help me although I'm ...,"This product seemed to help me although I'm not usually a big target for bugs. My husband, whom bugs like, didn't see a lot of difference when he wore it. I like anything that doesn't involve spraying stuff on me -- so the concept is good."
4,This product was a lot easier to use ...,"This product was a lot easier to use than sprays or lotions. It was very convenient and very effective. I'll continue to use this product. I'd also like to try it on my children, since mosquitoes are terrible this year."
1,Expensive but not effective,"I hate to give one-star reviews but in this case, I feel I'm compelled to. I bought this product because I hate DEET, sprays and creams especially before going to bed with the windows opened.I got bitten by a mosquito few hours after I wore this product...very close to where the band was wrapped around my wrist. Does it attract some mosquitoes? I bought two units and I am happily giving the second away."
4,Excellent,"I was pleasantly surprised when hearing Twarres' CD. Their voices harmonize beautifully, and almost every song could be a hit. Even if you don't understand Frisian (not Flemish), you'll appreciate the melodies of the song."
5,Some of the best mix for Frappes.,Our local coffee shop uses this mix and it's great. I have been thinking about buying some for home but I was wondering if someone could post the nutritional information for me.Thanks!
5,moving stories for dog lovers,These stories speak to all of us who know and love dogs. Anyone who has ever lost a faithful canine friend will be truly moved. There is a wonderful range of stories in this book.
2,Sad stories,"This book had some seriously sad stories in it. Some were pretty horrible. My wife wanted to read it, but I told her not to or she would have cried for days. Some were heart warming, but a lot were about dogs dying and some in some pretty horrible ways. I don't think I let my dog out of my sight for 3 days after reading this. The authors other book was much, much better."
4,Go for it,"Invaluable, this is the kind of book you'd want even if you lived in Sydney. It explains the different character of Sydney's neighborhoods and gives concise intelligent explanations of how Sydney has become the muti-faceted city it is. I've only been to Sydney twice, but with the help of this guide I'm beginning to get it. The maps are pretty good, but some lack detail. Hotel and restaurant sections are comprehensive, and in my experience extremely accurate."
4,Good preview,"This is a good city guide for Sydney.PROS:1. Enough general information for everyone.2. Map handout that you can pull out from the book.3. Lots of summaries of excursions and what places to see.CONS:1. Needs to have better descriptions of the top sights. For instance, get top 10 sites and directions how to get there."
2,Disappointed,"I knew I was purchasing the least expensive code free portable DVD player, but I intended to use it only to view the Region 4 DVD's I had purchased of a TV series that was only shown for a short time on US TV. I was really disappointed when the unit quit working about 6 weeks after I got it. I didn't want to put more money into having it repaired and have since resorted to watching the DVD's on my computer (which is a larger screen with great sound quality). When we upgrade our home audio/video equipment, I will buy a better quality code-free player."
4,Hogue Grip,this product was excellent in taming the recoil of the model 29 44magnum Smith and Wesson.Could not be more pleased
1,Never buy online,"I learned my lesson to never buy the grips online. Even though the manufacturer states the models their grips will fit, they dont always fit."
3,"The product smelled wonderful and lathered up nicely, ...","The product smelled wonderful and lathered up nicely, but I was expecting more of a silky, conditioned feel after washing my hair. Instead, I had to pile on a lot of conditioner to run a comb through my hair."
2,I didn't like the smell of this product ...,"I didn't like the smell of this product at all. Even though it's a standard, average shampoo the smell was so distracting that I wouldn't use it again."
2,Meh...,"Another Exploitation flick by Pinky violence...this one is nothing new. The actors are fun, and the plot though contrived and silly is also fun. There is some entertainment to be found in this film...but it is far from the best Pinky film."
1,Poor Image Quality,The description is fair.But the image quality is NOT acceptable in CD rom version.
4,"High adventures in Sherwood, Garnett style.","This book is a delight - great chemistry between Tre and his beloved, wonderful swordfights, and breathtaking passion and adventure that have me alternatively holding my breath in excitement or cheering our heroes on. ""Come on! Kick that stupid King John's --expletive censored-- !""The author is definitely a great storyteller, as she infuses her story with steep and realistic atmosphere of fear and uncertainty as befits the turbulent time period, along with swordfights and high raids the best this side of Errol Flynn. With a pair of great and noble lovers in the mainstage, well, this story shines."
1,would rate negative stars if possible,"I love a campy movie. I love horror movies. This move just sucks. It starts like the first 10 minutes of the movie are missing. Who are these people and what is the relationship? Never really addressed. Hardly any humor in this. Too little Christmas references. Did they forget this was a Christmas theme? It does get a little better in the second half, but the end disappoints too. In summary: storyline horrible, dialog bad, acting fair, cinematography fair. Don't waste your money on this. Watch Sean of the Dead again."
1,Save your money,"Didn't like any part of this . A 5th grader could have made a better movie . One more thing when i check the review it had a 4 star rate now just add these reviews and do the math. Someone is scamming the reviews big time and it must be the people that make the money , right Amazon ??"
1,keep moving,"Just from looking at the trailer the make up on the actor's are horrible for real. It doesnt look real non what so ever however, I havent seen the movie I was completly turn off from the movie. Once I saw the trailers I made up my mind not to watch I would have normally watched a low buget film,but this took the cake. I'm afraid I have to keep moving and I believe you should too unless you just want to be entertained."
2,Couldn't finish it,Just couldnt get through this movie. I wish I could have because there just arent enough zombie movie out there. Sadly this movie was very low quality.
2,Its Ok,"Well it wasn't the greatest zombie flick, but it was OK. Some obscure zombie flicks you don't even get all the way through them, but this one was ok enough to watch"
3,Not bad - funky santa insert,"This was a bit off-beat and the zombie santa ----- I wish they'd not have killed him right off --could have let him hang around and lurk about for a while, but the story line was good, the acting and action kept my interest so -- not bad if you can buy it in the $10 to $13 range and I liked it enough that I will re-watch, sure. So, on the shelf of keepers it goes for me -- check out the previews or get on youtube and watch them and you'll get the idea and the vibe of the film....no new groundbreaking plot here -- so the script/acting and the quirks carried it."
5,GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I saw Creager in person and had a good time. He looks like Donny Osmond (in a good way!), but he sang mostly other peoples songs. He sang Buffet, JJWalker,and tons of Robert Earle Keen, but not too much of his own music. I bought the CD so he could sign it and ended up loving the CD! I hope he feels more confident in his own music and attracks an older audience in the future!"
4,Off Da Hook!,This book was crazy...i mean it kept you turning the pages. Continoulsy! Lynda and her desire for Nikki was just too much. And then Lynda's husband...Oh Boy! I didn't really like the way it ended...because it seems as though it was calling for a sequel at the end. But all in all it was a good book.
3,There Better Be A Sequel!!!! (3.5 stars),"Ok by now you know the premise four friends take swinging to a new level by throwing a key party. Even the most conservative reader like myself will be curious to see what happens when four couples voluntarily decide to swap mates for one night of passion. And what ensues was much much more than what I expected so kudos to the authors for providing an entirely new spin to a seemingly predictable tale.But what took away from my enjoyment was the way in which the ends to this story were left loose. All the couples experience a dramatic change after partaking in the key party but the two couples who I was most caught up in, fates were left blowing in the wind. I don't want to ruin the read for anyone but I need closure and I'm going to patiently wait for it. Until then where do I leave my key????"
5,A Dynamic Book,A must read! Very unique aproach to new experiences and relationships. People get ready for the Sequel!-your BIGGEST fan! J.P.
2,Cheap Knockoff,"I bought this hoping to use it as a spare for my car. It didn't seem to work from anything other than really close range, and upon closer inspection, it appears to be another knockoff version made to look just like the real thing. If you compare this remote to a factory remote, the text is just slightly different. If it worked fine, the different text wouldn't be a big deal, but since it does not work, the text difference plays right into the off-brand theory."
3,Dead Sea Scrolls,From a Historianary perspective this is a great book to have. The text is revealed here with lots of commentary.These texts are not complete for much of it has been lost. Sort of a dry read but gives quite a bit of interesting info.
2,Ridiculous,"Now that all of the Dead Sea Scrolls have been published, this book is pretty much pointless. And Eisenman's theories are a stretch, to say the least."
3,"Okay if you get it on sale, changing pad is not padded","Based on the earlier reviews, I thought this bag was going to be quite a bit different from what I received. The bag doesn't hold very much and the interior compartments are very small. The changing pad is really a pad, it is a small piece of fabric with absolutely no padding. In the end, I decided to keep the bag since I bought it for such a great price, around $20. However, the bag is not worth much more than that."
1,Not many lullabyes in Spanish,"As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English. In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary. Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it."
1,A misinterepretation of beloved Latin classics,"There is no doubt the artist's voice is beautiful. However, the interpretation of certain songs by a man and child are way off. For example, ""Tengo Una Muneca"" is NOT a lullaby, but an upbeat children's song and to have a child drone it out debases such a Mexican classic. One of many aweful and inacurate musical interpretations on this misguided CD. For the best and most classic Spanish children's songs turn to the tender and playful ""Cri-Cri."""
1,it is bogus.,"this does not reflect the truth.I have read a lot about this issue. Armenians are holding the area they invaded in 1990's, and the whole world approves those areas don't belong to armenia. I am talking about Karabakh. It belongs to Azerbaijan, the neighbor country.This movie is just bogus."
1,Totally lie..,Turkish government has been asking the western's society to release both sides archives about this issue but somehow western's society such as European Court Of Human Rights has been denying this requests for a long time. Until this request will be satisfy all the allegations are INCORRECT and LIE. I will be asking the public DO NOT consider any criticism from this documentary or any documentary that has been approved by Turkish Government or European Court Of Human Rights... Please read the following link...[...]
4,"A Fascinating Look into Science's relation to religion, politics and culture","These are 3 lectures that Richard Feynman gave in 1963 discussing the role of uncertainty in the scientific method and the role of science in religion, politics, society and whatever else he felt like discussing at the time. (He does get side tracked a bit in the third lecture which did not have the organization of thought and planning that the first two did.) It is nonetheless a fascinating look at a brilliant mind and of our universe, both the discreet and the non-quantifiable.Don't be intimidated if you are not a physicist. These lectures were presented before a ""lay"" audience, and does not require any more science for enjoyment than you probably learned in high school."
3,Mediocre book overall,"Feynman is brilliant and the material contained in this book is definitely work reading. The first half of the book should get 6 stars. Once he gets into the unscientific age part of the book, it becomes a little hard to follow him. The first half and last quarter of the book are great. The only reason Im giving three stars is because he lost me when it came to some of his philosophical ideas. Never the less I recommend this book to anybody seeking to have a scientific understanding of things and to all the scientific minds out there"
2,Disappointing,"I have always heard such great things about Feynman and his writting and so I thought I would read this book. What a disappointment! Being the transcript of a series of lectures, it is difficult to follow as he rambles from one topic to another. There doesn't seem to be any coherent focus. He also seems to state things that are fairly obvious or superficial as though they are the great secrets of the universe. I have not given up on Feynman books, but this one was just not worth it."
5,Different and Thought Provoking - as Usual!,"If you've ever heard 6 Easy Pieces or any other recording of Feynman speaking then you'll appreciate the flow of the prose found here. It's easy to imagine you're having a conversation with RPF when you read this book - but then you come around and once again realise that this is a rare gem to be treasured. Any Feynman fan will love this book, anyone yet to discover one of the world's foremost thinkers (and philosophers - sorry Richard) will be captivated and want to find out more."
2,Below his other books and overrated by its title,"The book lacks the charm and tidiness of his other better thought out books. The publisher gave it a title to sell the book- the book does not deliver the ""meaning of it all"". Needs editing and shortening and retitling by Feynman himself.."
3,Even great scientists need a good editor,"Undoubtedly the guy was brilliant, and it's true there's wit and wisdom here. But the book records verbatim alot of unhelpful asides and circumlocution, and I think it would be immeasurably improved by a good editor wielding an intelligent red pencil. Perhaps it's one of the tragedies of fame that publishers know that a good edit won't increase sales, and its absence won't reduce them. I recommend the book for collectors of Feynmania only."
1,Feynmaniacs should read this review,"David Goodstein reviewed this book in ""Feynmaniacs Should Read this Review, Skip Lecture Collection, Save 22 Simoleons"" in the American Scientist, where he says it all. Not even Feynman himself wanted his John Danz Lectures to be published; they were published only after his death and against his will. As Dr. Goodstein put it, there is clearly a ""take the money and run"" attitude from Addison-Wesley in publishing this book. The lectures were inaptly edited, do not capture the flavor of the live lectures (however terse they might have been), and are badly dated. Save your simoleons.The mentioned review by D. Goostein is available on the internet -- just type its title in your favorite search engine."
4,Great Book,"This book is essentially a series of lectures given by Feynman at a university forum. The ideas and concepts expressed in the book are easy to read and very enlightening, even for people who are not scientists or philosophers. One of the most prevalent themes in the book is the idea that science and religion are set to answer different questions about our situation in this life, and that the questions proposed by science are not religious in nature, and the questions proposed by religion are not scientific in nature. Feynman's answer to these questions helps shed light on the current debate between scientists and theologians - and essentially, one feels that we are trying to make science into more than it was designed to be; more than it was designed to answer. Pretty amazing coming from one of the most accomplished scientists of our time. For further reading check out:Mere Christianity"
2,Full of doubt,"I picked up this book expecting it to give me interesting insights into the thoughts of Feynman in fields other than physics. The subtitle, ""Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist,"" is enough to make one expect greatness from this series of lectures. In the end, there just wasn't any substantial substance in this book; nothing to make one think and wonder about the place of a ""Citizen Scientist"" in our society. And worst of all, nothing to really indicate where Feynman thought his place in society was, as a Citizen Scientist."
4,TOO cheap,"I can now see that there's a problem with the images I'm taking; they have a ""shadow"" on the left side."
3,damaged boxes,"When I received the box at home from the U.P.S. driver, the box was badly damaged. I assumed it was just the outside box that was damaged. There were two more boxes to go through to get to the pans. Both the next outside box and the Revere box were badly damaged as well. This was a gift for an Anniversary present and how embarassing to have the box so ripped up and torn. I checked out all the pans and lids inside the box and nothing was damaged, only one scratch on one of the lid handles that could be buffed out. The rest of the merchandise inside the box was fine, but the box is in extremely sad shape. It looks like the fork lift ran right into the boxes. I am just glad they didn't send me one that the pans were bent and damaged."
5,Juke'n jive'n wail,"The Juke man just gets meaner and meaner...this pro keeps coming at you with a blistering harmonica style as in, 'Twice Pipes'...then puts you down easy, soft and subtle with, 'Lonely Freedom'...and his expressive and clean sound continues on, Don't Let Your Mouth Write a Check, That your Butt can't Cash'...Juke and the collective boosters on this CD take you on a smooth yet pulsating groove that is so fine, it can only shine...it will inspire your senses to enjoyment...and you will experience 'The Real Feel' down to your bones...Please, put more Juke in my stocking!!!"
4,entertaining first novel,"I enjoyed ""Death and the Easter Bunny."" I am drawn to southern mysteries and the language, expressions and characters were accurate and interesting. I was distracted by the fact that the Easter Bunny didn't enter the story until near the end of the book. In some cases I felt as if I had missed a previous book due to the history discussed. But Trudy and her cousin Hen, the sheriff, were believable likable characters and I look forward to the next Linda Berry book."
3,It is not what I expected,I bought this book thinking that I was going to receive more insight of Cartier-Bresson style. There is something but I expected more about the thinking of this master of Photography.
4,It's HCB!,Very interesting read. I would say a must have for fans of photojournalism and photography in general.Highly recommended.
1,worst movie of all time,its like a high school kid made it. absolutely horrible. no story and choppy animation. absolutely horrible and worst movie of all time
1,"Bad movie, very, very bad!","I have three children ages six, eight, and 10. My two youngest started wondering off within the first five minutes my oldest lasted a little bit longer maybe 10 minutes. My wife and I tried to watch the rest of it but couldn't take any more after about 30 minutes. I kept thinking this movie has got to get better,.......IT DOES NOT!! I hardly ever write reviews but I felt the need to warn people before they rented it or worse bought it!! I wish I'd read the reviews before I wasted my $1.18 at Redbox."
1,Insult to have this available for rent - 0 Stars!,"This was the single worst movie I have ever rented, period. Even my kids couldn't stand to watch it. The quality of the animation is horrendous and the story/characters are just painful. Just remove this from your inventory and do everyone a favor."
1,I was totally and utterly violated,"I've never in my life seen a movie this bad. It put me in a terrible mood just from watching the first 20 minutes. Even my 3 year old couldn't watch it. There are just no words. I seriously thought I had accidentally ordered a video game as there were such long stretches with nothing happening at first (and through out), I thought I was supposed to be doing something with the remote to make things happen with the movie. Forget making this on a PC or Mac, I think I could make something with better CGI on my iphone in less than a day.There are some movies that are so bad, they are awesome to watch and you can have fun with it. Like some Bravo show or something. Well this is NOT that. Both my wife and I were just angry from watching this. Nothing in my life ever made me hate my kids as much as this movie. You think I'm exaggerating, but in all honest, this review barely touches on how horrible this movie is."
1,Do I HAVE to put 1 Star up for THIS??,"OH. MY. WORD. The other reviews are correct. I had to double check the date of the movie to see if it was made in the 1990s only to be astonished that it is 2012. REALLY amateur animation, amateur music, some sexual innuendos thrown in. This movie was 1.5 hrs long but I swear it was more like 5 hrs it was so slow. Surprised my kids didn't fall asleep watching it."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen.,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. We watched it as part of a school movie night and the parents couldn't wait for the movie to be over. It has some of the worst animation, dialog, music, and acting that I have ever seen."
1,They call this a movie???,"More like animation from 20 years ago, and they hadn't even made animation yet, to me this is not expectable for publishing, SHOULD BE RATED CRAP standing for CRAP"
1,Life's a Bunghole,"My guess, a high school graphic design team won a contest and got to make this movie. I can't describe how bad this movie is so I'll leave it at that. I would like to know who edited this movie and okay'd it's release. Redbox, u owe me one."
1,complete waste of money,this is what you call complete b.s. as in that is even an understatement. whoever made this should seriously consider another job like any job at all. i mean seriously it is simply horrible. whoever wrote the script did horribly. whoever did the animation messed the entire thing up. i mean the snow looks like dough and just cut the crap with the excessive music. it looks like a messed up video game. and i'm pretty sure alligator don't snap their jaws like that. i mean i had to watch this with my nephews and i seriously considered breaking the tv. i mean it. it IS that BAD. Don't let the pack deceive you!!!!!!!!!
1,Dear Gods run away!!!!,"I'm not quite sure I can put into words how horrible this was. You know those really crappy commercials on TV that are for some local company? And all they can afford is some college kid that only made it through Animation 101? This is worse than that! It's painfully....I repeat PAINFULLY slow. Like, I kept checking to see if the DVD was skipping or glitching because it was so slow. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. Dialogue and plot (lack of?) makes NO sense. Nonsensical. And just weird. Not to mention the terrible lessons it's teaching. Hmm... Bully the cat and pull it's tail. How does the cat deal with the tail pulling? By throwing a baseball into the dog's face. Great lesson to teach kids. Oh yeah. It lasts forever too. I have no idea how many minutes it officially is but I guarantee you it'll feel like MUCH longer."
5,The New Sting,"Our family has found a new understanding of winter while watching this DVD amidst a blizzard which dumped two feet of snow and blew it into six to ten foot drifts. Our two daughters and grandson are musicians and are in awe of the talent Sting gathered around him to put on this concert. The documentary gave them ideas for their own ambitions in future concerts and recordings. Thanks, Sting."
4,It's Sting,"My wife loves Sting. Bought this for a gifts. It's not his best work, but it's still good. I like it."
3,"Blow hot, blow cold","'Surgeon-Commander Simon Redman did not in the least want to take charge of an eighteen-year-old ward, and Sally Galbraith felt no more enthusiastic about her stern guardian-to-be.But each changed their mind before the end of the story.'"
4,Extreme 1940's fashion for women,"This collection of two hardcovers is a real conversation piece. Both editions are full of B&W/color photos, illustrations, comics, advertisements, and cartoons. There is a heavy slant on bondage, restraint, and domination.This is a facinating look back into 1940's women's fashions and attitudes which were a step beyond the norm.The two editions are hardcover and come boxed.If you like this, I also recommend EXOTIQUE which is also published by Taschen."
5,An excellent rebirth of superb work daring in its time,The complete series are reprinted in high quality paper back in large size format. All of the excellent drawings are well presented and the full unabridged text is preserved for all readers. The subject matter was daring in its time and still retains that haunting exotiqua that is John Willie. Readers and afficionados will not be disappointed. It is racy without vulgarity and caters to those interested in the beautiful and the stunning.
4,An Inspiring Magazine,"Bizarre is clearly the basis for much similar modern writing - you can see its influence in many places today. However, it is of more than historical interest; a lot of it is enjoyable reading even today, and some of the bondage pictures - even in murky black and white - are magnificent. I have been inspired and encouraged by it to lace my corsets tighter and wear shoes with higher heels. Of course, after half a century some things have changed; we would no longer encourage teenage girls to smoke or countenance cruelty to horses for example. (We might not even want to encourage the caning of children, but in modern society ill-treating horses is probably considered a worse sin!) However, if this sort of thing appeals to you, buy these books."
5,Great reading for the erotically inclined!,"If your interests are with the exotic or erotic, it is sure to be included. A very interesting look at what went on behind closed doors from another era. Wonderful insights into forbidden sexuality and emerging trends. Recomended reading for enthuasists."
1,ripoff,"Disappointing:- very bad quality reproductions of Wllies drawings and photographs,they are blured and lose much of the detail. Many amateur drawings clearly not by Willie.Only good pics. are on the cover."
1,A Discrace to the King of Thailand!!,"This 1999 version of the original film is severely unhinged. The people who created it must have had no respect for the monarchy, culture, or religion of Thailand. Although the cover may seem appealing, it lacks music that makes you want to join in. By the time you're finished with this one, you'll want to vomit!"
4,Beautiful Pitcher,"This pitcher is lovely. However, I was surprised at the size of it. It's quite large. Unless you have lots of people to serve from it, it's not practical as a serving dish. I'd say more decorative. Beautiful though."
1,An Orthodox point of view,"The Anti-Christ is anyone that tries to get you to deny Christ read Col 2:8. The reformers of the 14th, 15th, ect. centuries had legitimate complaints and concerns about the RCC. However, they completely and totally over reacted and simply became pridefull (isn't pride a sin?) gratifiers of their own egos.All protestants are ""crypto-paptist."" Any protestant that disagrees is rejecting the fact of the truth that ""the Reformation did not put an end to the medievil papacy or its pretensions, it merely democratized it and made everyone Pope."" Saying the Pope is the anti-christ is like saying Ronald Wilson Reagan was the 666. Funny stuff."
5,Beauty and the Beast,"Lady Madelyn Fairchild has a title and great beauty, but there's something missing in her life...she's never known love, she's just known pain at the hands of the people who should have loved and cared for her. She finds that missing piece of herself in Jean-Luc Gavereau. He's a man whose scarred exterior masks an equally scarred interior. Together they find that two wounded hearts just might be able to take the biggest gamble of all...to trust in a love they've never known and never expected to find.The third book in Wilson's ""Heart"" series is as wonderful as the first two. Her characters have depth and pull you into the stories, until you absolutely can't put down the book!"
4,Powerful emotion at its best,"As always, Gayle Wilson's historical novels don't disappoint. The Gambler's Heart is no exception. Emotionally intense to an almost painful degree, Ms Wilson tells a complex, intriguing, gritty tale of two wounded people - one physically, the other emotionally - healing each other and finding a love that makes them whole again. A remarkable story by a remarkable writer who challenges the reader into feeling - living- being part of the hero & heroine's lives, emotions and, finally, their joy as they reach out into each other's souls to find a heart-warming, memorable love."
3,Not The Best,"I'd give this book 2.5 stars. I agree that it did have a lot of potential, but I didn't find that it lived up to my expectations. The relationship between Maddy and Jean-Luc didn't develop enough during the book to make the ending very credible. Neither of them treated the other particularly well, and there seemed to be very little trust between them. I was looking forward to reading this book, but can't recommend it. It leaves you with an uneasy, rather than contented, romantic feeling. I didn't like the story very much. For a book with a similar basic plot - a physically disfigured man believing himself to be not worthy of love - I highly recommend ""Texas Destiny"" by Lorraine Heath, which is a beautiful, stunningly well-written and memorable story."
5,My favourite romance,This is the best romance book I read in my life and I'm sorry because there are a lot of people in the world that never read it. Thank you Gayle Wilson for sharing this wonderful love story with us!
3,A little disappointed but not a bad read.,The writing in this book is kind of all over the place and generally I'm disappointed. Either nothing is happen or there is an absolute crisis with nothing in between. While I can't really fault either of the main characters the development is poor and the attempt at suspense by not filling the reader in on exactly what's going on makes our heroine seem overly emotional and out of control. A lot of the really good parts fall flat because not enough information is given early on and it's hard to stay involved with the story line. Some of the story is just unrealistic bordering on idiotic - just too over the top. Some subtlety would have been nice.
3,This shampoo has a pleasant and not overpowering ...,"This shampoo has a pleasant and not overpowering floral/herbal scent (the fragrance was much less intense than two Herbal Essences shampoos I've tried). It cleaned my hair and rinsed out easily. It also lathered well in hard water. I didn't really notice that my hair had more body after using this """"extra body"""" shampoo, but it did clean my hair more thoroughly than most other shampoos. It seemed on the strong side for a daily shampoo, so those with dry hair might find it too harsh."
3,child development and education book review,"I was happy with the book. It arrived quickly and in great condition. My only issue is that it did not have the 3 CD's that come with new edition. I emailed customer service with my complaint and they sent me another book, but still without the CD's. After some investigation they figured out that the book they are advertising does not come with the CD's. I was dissappointed :("
3,"Nice to look at, but not totally functional.","When I bought this teapot I thought I could heat water in it and then add tea. I was wrong. You can not use this for heating the water, you must first heat the water in a different container, then add the hot water to the teapot. The manufacturer says that if it is used to heat up the water that the internal porcelin finish can be ruined. What's the point to having a teapot that you can't use to heat water...?"
3,Not for long term,"Wonderful for making (brewing) tea, the type from real leaves (ie. not Lipton). However, the enamel has started to flake off near the top and the spout and the small handle on the lid is wobbly. Still works but once this one bites the dust, I'll buy a better quality one."
3,Not Too Shabby,"Holds more than it looks like it will. Can easily fill 3 decent sized tea cups (using regular coffee mugs because I'm a dude). Over time it does start to rust pretty easliy, and if you leave your tea in the pot (as I do if I am only making a pot for me) by the time you are pouring the last cup it has a distinct dirty taste to it. Reading about the Chinese and this whole bit about how a little rust is suppose to be ok...it's not cool for me if it changes the flavor of my tea."
2,coating inside chips off!,"the paint gradually began to chip off, and sure enough we began drinking it, very dissatisfied with the product. I would not recommend it to anyone. It will keep your tea warm for a good period of time since its cast iron though. It only took several months before the paint began chipping off."
3,Loved it until black stuff started flaking off,"I have loved this teapot and used it every day for about 9 months. However, recently black stuff which looks like plastic has started flaking off around the rim and I have stopped using it since I do not know what this substance is. I also noted teapot was made in China and that raised my level of concern about what is flaking off."
5,love it,HI I read this book as the second one in the series I know in the wrong order but I loved how it kept me guessing as the who the killer was and than it was someone I had least expectedI give this book a [5-star] rating
3,A bit tiresome,"It took me almost half the book to really get into the story. I found it far too similar to previous stories in the series. Once again, Roarke is connected to the murder site, the murder weapon, the murderer, or some combination thereof. Once again, his past is an issue - one that is conveniently troublesome and yet handily overlooked to the benefit of resolving the case. The characters are still entertaining at times, but getting a bit flat. And Roarke's display of jealousy/rage did nothing for me. Jealousy is fine, but beating someone up - especially when he knew the advance was unwelcome and would be taken care of properly by Eve - seemed over-the-top and gratuitous. As for the murder mystery itself, I wasn't overly caught up in it. I'll definitely pick up the next book, but my enthusiasm for the series is waning unless something unexpected and Different begins to occur."
5,This is the latest and the best,This book was great it didn't lack anything. McNab and Peabody are up to it again. And Eve and Roarke are still butting heads it's as good as the rest of the In Death series.
5,Another great installment,"I have to admit upfront that I am biased -- I am very much an Eve Dallas fan. So I am perhaps not the most judicious critic.But this latest installment is very well done, I think. Don't want to give the plot away, so I'll just say that the combination of professional problems and personal issues are well defined and work together to make a fascinating story.My only criticism (which is not new) is that Roarke seems too perfect, almost a cardboard cut-out of a hero. And Dallas seems to always be apologizing to him for who she is, while he goes along merrily interferring in her cases and buying everything in sight.I'd highly recommend this book to all J.D. Robb fans. To those who are new to the series, this is a good book, but to really enjoy it, you should start reading at the beginning of the series."
4,Another Great Eve Dallas book,I'm an Eve Dallas fan. I love the futuristic setting and am addicted to murder mysteries. Keep writing them!!! I think they would make great movies and try to figure out who would play each part.
3,Not the best,I have read every book in the In Death series and this one was a disapointment. While there are still some interesting scenes( particularly the one between Eve and Dr.Mira) The book never seems to go any where. Perhaps it is time for J.D Robb to start delving into her character's past because their presents are growing stale. I would however reccomend this book to anyone who is a regular reader of the series but if this is to be your first novel I would instead read one of her first ones.
4,This series is addictive.,"Yet another In Death tale that grabs you and pulls you in. Judgment in Death had me anxiously waiting to find out if my fears about the murder were correct or not. This story had me both hoping that Dallas would catch and save the bad guy. This book, like the others before it in the series, just keeps me coming back for more."
4,Judgement in Death,This one was really really interesting. It had a very different plot than most of her do. This was definitely one I lost sleep over by staying up way too late to finish what happens.
1,Horrid paper,Overpriced book . Horrid paper. I wanted a quality hardback book. This is really junk. I've had some paperback books with much better paper than this. Don't waste your money.
5,Good book,Like reading books by this author. The cop should have a child to make it interesting this would make Eve come full circle
3,Not the best.,"I found the latest In Death book slightly disappointing. The mystery was interesting, but the lives of the characters remained static. Even the dialog, funny at times, seemed a bit stale.There was no progress in their relationships. Eve and Roarke have a fight, and the making-up covers more than half of the personal aspect of the book, but it wasn't anything new. Peabody and McNab make NO progress at all.As for Eve's past, the one new developement came late in the book and seemed tossed in as an afterthought. Coming on the heels of Witness, which was brilliant and satisfying on all levels, I would have to say that Judgement, which will have to hold me for at least six months, was a let-down."
2,Boring!,"I was really hoping for a much better story than the last, however, J.D. Robb failed to pulled it off. No sparks between Roarke and Eve, or Eve and Peabody. Lackluster story/case. Even though the victims in this story were cops, I never had the feeling that Eve cared about them. I wish the author had drawn out a better villian. There were so many possibilities, but... nothing happened. The last 3 books have really been such a bore. I wish she had made a full novel out of the brilliant Midnight In Death novella. I may continue to hang on to the series for two more books, but if this continues, I'll just go back and reread the first 6 or 7 books in the series."
4,For R and E fans,"There is not much chemistry btwn them any characters in the book. The mystery was quite predictable. Of course, Roarke would be connected to the case again. Hello! He DOES own 28% of the planet! Well, I find the book is saved by the new depth to Roarke's character and the new layer of Roarke's and Eve's relationship. That things are not unrealistically happily ever after, this gives the series a high degree of vasimilitude. And it is nice to see R show a bit of jealousy... I find that this book does approach Roarke's and Eve's relationship in another light which is interesting and intriguing to me. I have always liked R and E, so if you are like me, read it. However, if you are for a good mystery, brain straining type, don't."
1,Bad as far as bad goes,"When I picked up the book, I was quite intrigued by the title and cover text but this interest soon turned into pain. The storyline is mediocre and it is almost impossible to guess the killer. This can not be construed as a feature, though. The people and ""twists"" are just so convoluted or plain ""flat"" that nobody could be expected to understand their motives -- if there should be any.I surely won't read anything by this ""author"" again. If you want SciFi crime novels, keep to Niven."
2,Boring!,"I have read worse novels than this one, but it was baaaad just the same. I guess going by the reviews I am ne of the few people who didnt like this one and I really don't understand what's there to like in this one.I didn't even know that J.D Robb was Nora Roberts! Thank God I got this book from the library and didn't buy it!The main characters were irritating to their core, or maybe I found them irritating because I haven't red the previous 10 or so books written before this one(and now I will not read them)I just finished this absurd piece of tale because I hate to give back any bok unread."
4,Great Developmental Toy for 1-year old!,"My 1-year old daughter loves to play with the blocks. She clicks them together to make noise, knocks down my towers, and tries to stack one on top or remove just one block. She giggles when they fall and I pretend to be upset that my tower has fallen. I can see her concentrating when trying to grab just the top block, and then laughing when she knocks the whole thing down.The nice thing is that this is a toy that can grow with her. She obviously can't tell letters yet, but knows some objects (like kitty-cat and butterfly) by their photos.On the bad side: The house the blocks stay in is flimsy and not well sanded; the plastic shields that hold the blocks in place slide out easily and do not have very smooth edges; it's messy because the blocks go everywhere (but what house with kids doesn't have toys hiding under the couch anyway).Overall - great developmental toy that can grow with her developing mind."
1,"Fun lights, horrible speakers","I tested the iPulse at Sharper Image and came to the conclusion that the speakers are horrible. I was drawn to these speakers, because the lights looked like a lot of fun. Regardless of that opinion, the sound out of this device is horrible. The speakers had a pathetic base and the sound was very tin-like. If you want rich sounding speakers do some more research, if you want to waste a whole lot of money to stare at some pretty colors for a while, well then this product is for you!"
1,Horrible sound,"I bought this item because it looked like fun, but the sound is awful - very little bass, muddy highs, very boxy sounding. As my wife very aptly put it, ""it sounds worse than my laptop"". We have a Bose SoundDock as well, and if its sound quality is a 10, this one is barely a 1. We've heard some pretty awful-sounding audio gear designed by Sharper Image, but we were fooled by the marketing hype they have about their new aluminum cone speakers. These speakers do little to overcome Sharper Image's lack of audio engineering prowess."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!,"At first I was pleased when i turned it on, I was okay for 1 min, then it stopped working, it become slow then it did nothing. It is poorly made.They need to improve this product. It doesnt even deserve one star. I had to put it for AMAZON."
5,My daughter dances to every song!,"I have been playing this CD for my daughter since she was five months old. Now, at 18 months, she dances and wiggles with glee at the first note. Plus, it is children's voices that are singing the songs and she totally connects. If you have to listen to kid songs, and you know you do, this one is palatable."
1,"so bad, it's good","This is the sort of awful music, performance, and album cover design that is too good to be made up. I had the privilege of seeing Nina's rump-shaking performance at Sidewalk Cafe and I was touched for life. The artwork on this album is beyond... It's sort of like if there were a mongoloid version of American Idol (oh, wait!) and the worst contestant somehow was given the gift of funding for an album. If you're into camp, kitsch, and especially if you are gay, you are going to LOVE this. Place this CD, unopened next to that Barbie that came with the wheelchair; somethings never go out of style. Even though this girl can't sing and her friend can't play the guitar, I do truyl admire her for making it happen. I love of people who do have talen never get of their asses. If she can get a gig, you can."
1,Waste of time,"I must admit to being utterly disappointed with this book. So much so, that I skipped most of it and ultimately decided it to be a waste of time. Spelling errors, repetitive language and uninteresting commentary seem to be a consistent theme in this book. I would neither recommend its purchase, nor borrowing it from a friend. Don't waste your time."
3,Nice sunglasses,"I ordered one pair of these sunglasses after carefully looking at several pairs of inexpensive sunglasses online. The sunglasses that I received look pretty good, but they appear to be slightly different than the photo shown in the listing. Actually, I received two different pairs of sunglasses (1 free). Even though they are not exactly what I expected, the price was right, I did get two pair of sunglasses for the price of one, and they are good enough. So I probably will keep them rather than go through the inconvenience of returning them."
2,Wrong glasses,we were sent the wrong glasses and we tried to contact amazon but got no reply. These were not the glasses my son wanted but because we spent the money he kept them. When we looked at the picture of the glasses online and the ones we were sent they were not the same.
4,An Eye Opener About United Nations Corruption,"Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.N., writes a revealing account of U.N. incompetence, corruption and lack of judgement. The U.N. cannot make moral decisions about global actions. Therefore, its enforcement and moral standing is nonexistent. With imposed impartiality, it failed to act in Rwanda and Bosnia and even caused the murder of thousands in Srebrenica. Its member refuse to condemn such human rights abusers as China, Zimbabwe, Syria and Iran - while readily condemning Israel and the U.S. Take this book as a warning toward the implementation of contrivances like the International Criminal Court. Will the Chinese judge on the court vote to release Chinese dissidents? Unlikely that they will tackle thorny and needed issues."
4,What about Bush Multinationals?,"This is an outing of the weakness of the UN, but what about the one world government being created by the Multinationals who are taking American's sovereignty away? This mad rush towards Globalism pushed on by the Bush Neocons, and his corportate crony insiders, should be of even more concern. Compared to them, the UN is impotent."
2,A Jewish Perspective on The UN's Role in the New WOrld Order,"This book is written exclusively from a pro-Israeli stand-point. The author is a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and, as such, spends chapter after chapter trying to exonerate Israeli foreign policy which has often been condemned by several UN Security Council resolutions.However, this book is a useful guide to showing you how politicians create a 'camouflage of confusion' and how the many UN splinter organisations have consistently aided genocide in Africa by handing out free guns.Not really essential reading - and has no information at all about the founding of the UN, the Meditation Temple in the basement and the UN's links to the Alice Bailey Lucis (Lucifer Publishing) organisation."
2,"Looks nice, but don't expect it to hold water","My wife bought this thinking it would be good for the fall party to let the kids bob for apples. To our surprise, after we filled it with water, our kitchen floor was suddenly covered in water! Took us by surprise. Amazon should revise the listing to show that it is not cabable of holding liquids."
3,Graphical MUD,"When Everquest first came out I saw the price for the game. $49.99 or $39.99, I can't remember which. Then I found out you had to pay a monthly fee. I said to myself, ""People have to be crazy."" Then I found Everquest: Evolution for $29.99 at Best Buy. I said to myself, ""Ok. I think I will check this out.""IF you have ever played the Mirkwood MUD or Sojurn MUD back during the early days of the Internet then you already have a heads up on how to play Everquest. The difference is EQ has graphics and those other MUDs are text-based.Evolutions is worth the price even if you have to pay $13 a month. I would have given it more stars, but I have only been playing it a week."
2,Boring,"I just found this game boring. There's little else I can say. I have played a whole bunch of games, and this did not catch my interest after a year. I mean, I'm still playing Diablo and Diablo II."
2,It's just good!,I have played this game and found it to be pretty bland. It definately did not live up to its hype! Not enough action (compared to planetside). Camera view did not allow for you to see whats behind you or in your preferial vision. Not to mention that the game is very difficult to learn at first. Other than that the game is pretty good.
3,Very good product,"Very good product for the price ($42)...The forecast icon area and the pressure are a bit confusing. Also the bottom forecast area leaves room for improvement. Keeps telling me a ""tempest"" has an 80% chance of occuring, but no ""tempest"" yet...Glass should be non-glare. Again, bottom line is that at Ron's Hardware for $42, you can't beat this product...One final note: the sensor should have been aTX21U-IT instead of a TX28U-IT, but that's what's in the packaging from China..."
3,Regular user of La Crosse products,"I very much like the information displayed and how it is arranged. The transmitter is outside a window on the opposite side of the condo and the unit still easily receives the signal through several walls. The only significant negative is there is extra clear plastic covering the front which is highly reflective, often making the information hard to read from many angles. I'm even debating trying to cut it off and make it like other La Crosse stations where the liquid crystal level is the top surface."
4,Good service once activated,"I had difficulty getting the transmission from outside to inside working. And the information at the bottom is extremely difficult to read, especially if your eyes have been on earth for a while. Other than that, it provides what I thought it would."
2,weather station,The produce seems to work well but I don't like the reset procedure after changing the batteries. My biggest complaint is that the display is very hard to read in certain light conditions. A red or green readout would be much easier to see in low light. And the glass should be non-glare.
3,weather station,it works well but find the display is not bold in terms of reading the data on the screen.
2,eats batteries,"Nice size unit, good detail, BUT.... It went through batteries ever 4 to 5 days.So much activity on the base. Used the batteries reccomended too! Sent it back, They need to make ones that work off ac power for the base unit.Very dissapointed."
3,La crosse Weather Channel Weather Station,"The product works fine, but the product description on the internet was a bit misleading. We saw this product on a number of websites and each implied (but didn't directly say) that the device is wirelessly connected to The Weather Channel forecast. Unfortunately the only aspect of the device having to do with The weather Channel is the sticker on the top of the screen."
1,SEAL HANDBOOK REVIEW,"THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A HANDBOOK. THE INFORMATION IS VERY, VERY GENERAL. THERE ARE NO EQUATIONS OR CHARTS. THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE TABLE OF SEAL MATERIALS FOR VARIOUS FLUID SERVICES. IT COVERS ONLY GENERALLY ACCEPTED DESIGN, OPERATIONAL, AND SERVICE CRITERIA. THIS BOOK PROBABLY COULD BE USED BY AN ENGINEER LOOKING FOR GENERAL INFORMATION FOR A POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF MECHANICAL SEALS. THIS BOOK IS VERY LIGHT READING AND IS, AT BEST, A BASIC INTRODUCTION TO MECHANICAL SEALS. I WAS CONSIDERING BUYING IT BUT FORTUNATELY I BORROWED IT FROM A LIBRARY. DO NOT BUY IT, BORROW IT FROM A LIBRARY."
3,Not my favorite Baha Men CD,"The song Mash de Roach is great!!! But that's about all I can say. I was disappointed with this one. I love the Baha Men, especially Kalik and Junkanoo... those discs are unbelievable! Doong Spank is interesting, but aside from Mash de Roach, and maybe Double Lovin' most of the songs are repetative."
1,Poor attempt at Celtic/New Age,"I gave the samples a try. They sounded like someone tried to combine a modernized concept of ""Celtic"" with that bad synthesizer new-age music from the early 80's. It is nothing like Irish or Scottish Celtic folk music and only badly related to historically inspired Celtic interpretations like Loreena McKennitt. If you are seriously thinking about buying this you had better listen to the samples first, or you may be in for an unfortunate surprise."
2,Nothing extraordinary,"I ran across a recommendation for Kristine when checking out Sarah Brightman music. That set unfortunate expectations. To compare those two artist is like comparing a world champion to a family friend. I hear Kristine as a pleasant, competent Irish folk singer, but nothing about the album- Everchanging Tides- really grabbed me. Reminds me a little of Joan Baez."
3,"Not the worst, not the best",There is really good Celtic music out there. This is not one of them. There is really bad Celtic music out there. This is not one of them. Well yeah there are some really bad songs you will just skip but there are a few songs I thought were okay. Still all things considered if I were to give a suggestion it would be to try something else.
2,Amateurish,"I was very, very disappointed in this CD. I bought it based upon the recommendations here at Amazon, but it makes me wonder....I recommend from now on to listen to a snippet before you buy. Her voice just sounded very, very amateurish to me. It sounded like so typically of somebody singing at a small town country fair. I wish her luck, but I think she will have an appeal to people looking for the same ol', same ol' small town overly trilled voice."
5,Don't change the 'Everchanging Tides'!!!,"Kristine's tone is reminiscent of the melody usually found in the hills of Ireland. This is a wonderful collection of songs written with great musicality, and greater verse and lyrics. The songs are instantly familiar and well paced. This is obviously more than a commercial effort, and deserves high consideration."
2,Disappointment,"From the editorial reviews, I expected to love this book. As a total book lover, I found Sixpence House to be depressing. The authors attitute towards books in general, as well as his own, are a downer and the descriptions of Hay and it's surrounds were totally uninspiring. I found completing the book a chore."
4,"Look Out, UK. Ex-Pats, Awaaaayyyy!","For the most part I enjoyed this little book. It's easy enough to finish it in one sitting.The author details his experience of uprooting from San Fran and heading to a tiny village/town in Wales. The town has more than its fair share of booksellers and the shenanigans promptly ensue as he is offered employment. Along the way, we learn about a myriad of different rare books. We also get to follow the trials and tribulations he and his wife encounter as they try and purchase a house.I could have done without some of the social ""bad america"" commentary but in the grand scheme of things, it's not like he is wrong on any of the counts.This book has certainly whet my appetite for a trip across the pond."
5,Get Everything That Paul Collins Writes,"I began with ""The Trouble with Tom"" and then had to get everything that Paul Collins has written.Follow this writer; he has wonderful things coming; I am certain of it. ""Sixpence House"" is charming, honest, intelligent writing; it's on my re-read-often list."
2,A dull memoir,"I hoped to love this book, because I love books in general. While Collins has a nice writing style, the story line just never clicked with me. American man goes to the UK, wanders around in a town of bookstores, looking for a house which he never buys, then returns home. I read the bookstore parts, which were alright, but only skimmed the final half. I was just bored. Even the most interesting character (bookseller Booth), wasn't really that interesting. No 84 Charing Cross Road here, sorry!"
3,Bill Bryson lite,"I've been to Hay on Wye numerous times (I lived in North Shropshire from 1972 - 1991) so I was curious to read Collin's take on the place. He has a very journalistic, Bill Bryson-like style and the book starts out full of promise but somewhere about two-thirds of the way along it seems to lose its way.A great way for a writer to have a tax-deductible holiday, is the way it comes across. Not ever believable that he ever actually intended to live there with his family."
3,Books!,"This is an autobiographical account of an extended visit to a town with lots of bookstores in Wales. The mountains of books and the abundant book trivia make this book interesting. And it is enlightening to see an American's view of the town. However, I felt that I was taking up too much space in the Collins' home and I was embarrassed to be eavesdropping on their everyday activities."
5,A wonderful trip,"For those that want to read a wonderful story by a very talented writer, they will find it here along with some original, thoughtful, and witty obsevations about life and books. Every page was a pleasure."
2,Meh,"I was very disappointed with this ""memoir."" The author can't tell the reader often enough how very smart and cool he is compared to every other illiterate back in America. You can be quite sure that plays well overseas with all the ""playwrights on the dole."" I guess I'm just not cool enough to snidely agree with his alarmingly shallow view of the wonderful and diverse population we have in all corners of this wildly beautiful place. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,"Sturdy, light, perfect.","Have had this little suitcase for 2 years now. It has been on several international trips and looks like new. It's super light, but expands to fit almost anything. I generally use the expander and check the bag, rather than carrying it on as it seems to be just within the standard carryon dimensions. Couldn't recommend a better bag!"
5,This is the best value luggage in cheap price,"I have never purchased Delsey product until saw the review from other owners, now I want to say, they are telling the truth, the spacey luggage with carry-on approval dimension, it's very convenience.You cannot believe the compartment design is also friendly also, since I need to wear suit for formal meeting as well.The expandable space design is great for additional stuff like gift for family.The solid hand grip and ergonomic wheels make user easy to pull and handle.I was worry about the dark green color is a little feminine, after I compare from other travelers', I found out it's very easy to be recognized."
4,Works as advertised,"I went carry on for a week in Mexico and have used the case on numerous business trips. I can get four days of business clothes and a week of vacation clothes in the case and it fits in the overhead every time. The only thing to be aware of is with the expander open some smaller overheads may be difficult to get the case in to. The handles on three sides, top, side, and bottom make lifting the case easier than other cases. The separate divider in the top cover allows pants or dress shirts to stay neat.All in all I am satisfied with the case and now my wife wants one."
5,Great suitcase!,"This is the best suitcase purchase I've ever made! I came across it after I researched luggage on the Consumer Reports website and their top pick was a Delsey model (although a slightly different one that this). I settled on this different model because it was very similar but comes in colors besides black, which is key for finding it quickly in the sea of black rolling suitcases at baggage claim. It's attractive, sturdy, functional, durable, and best of all the price is right. The cost is similar to what you would find at a big box store, but the quality is FAR better. I've never owned a suitcase that cost more than a couple hundred, so I can't effectively compare it to something in that category, but I can say that it's the best suitcase I've ever had for this kind of price."
5,Great Heavy Duty,Nice heavy duty card wallet. I like it. Keeps my extra cards well covered in my other pocket from my main wallet.Heavy stitching looks like it will last a long time
5,Great Wallet,I bought this for my husband he Loves it. With all the discount cards he needed something to hold all his cards and this works perfectly and has extra pockets for his ID & Cash!
5,Fantastic Price + Quality,"These little biz card holders are fantastic. They're built sleek and thin, but expandable with a huge capacity for holding cards. The leather finish is very nice as well with my favorite being the standout light tan. The viewing window cleverly provides for the display of your own card, with an additional exterior pocket for collecting other's business cards. Well done people. I've bought about five of these units for myself and as gifts for others. Thanks for reading.Blessings to all."
4,Could be a little thinner,"I use this as a front pocket wallet. I like the expanding pocket, it can hold many cards but also can hold a couple cards securely without being loose and having your cards fall out when you open it. It has just enough room for bills that are folded in half. I wish though it was a little thinner, the pocket in the front of the wallet could be eliminated to help with this. This is the only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars. Can't beat the price."
3,"Good look and feel, wish a bit more practical","I love the look and feel of this wallet but unless you jam it full of cards and/or cash then it's a little too loose for my liking. If you tip it upside down for just a second then everything can come crashing out, I know because it's happened to me. Overall still good but that's a big factor for me."
4,slim ID and credit/debit card wallet,"i bought this wallet to replace a similar one that went through a laundry cycle. i love the style and have used leather wallets like this for years. this wallet has a clear plastic ID window which securely displays my drivers licence and there are ample card slots to hold numerous credit and debit cards. this is slim wallet, not bulky like many others. i use to carry a money clip for $ bills but found that this wallet can carry some of them as well. this wallet is well made, and for the price it was a great deal and well worth the money."
4,Decent Wallet for Cards,"This is a decent quality wallet with enough space for 10-15 cards. I like the transparent section to hold ID. What I would have really liked to make this a 5 star is a card slots were of incremental height, making it easier for me to access card on the back."
1,It's to darn small,"""Carry more than 50 business cards with ease"" is what it says in the discription, but it's between a 16th of an inch and an 8th of an inch to narrow to hols even one business card without it bending.It also is a bit hard to hold more than one or two credit card as well.Ather than that it is a nice design well built and if business card fit in it it would be exactly what I want"
1,cheap and ugly looking,don't buy it.. original product looks very different.pictures are totally different what it looks in reality.not worth buying and the seller service is poor.tried to return but cost more than buying.horrible and cheap product quality
4,"nice, small card holder","Bought this on impulse to see if it would meet my needs. It was cheap enough that if it didn't work for me, I wouldn't be too disappointed. The card holder is pretty much as advertised. The video review with this item is very accurate. The only point of difference I would make is that while it's leather, it's not really amazing quality leather. It's a little thin, but it seems like it will hold up."
3,Happy shopping,"The earrings are nice for their price but they are very soft and thin. When I was trying to wear them, they kept bending. I wouldn't suggest them for everyday wear."
1,Sterling hoops,The thin piece of wire that inserts into the hoop for closure broke the first time I attempted to put on the earrings. Disappointing and a waste of money.
3,Jewelry Lover,I bought these earrings in the summer and loved them at first. When they arrived I must say I was littel disappointed in the quality of the earring. You have to be very carefully putting them on as they are fragile. If you can deal with that then they are okay. One good thing is they were delivered to me 2-3 days earlier than I had anticipated.
1,Very dated,I didn't know when I ordered this that it was such an old book. It's not that the kitchens are bad but the book and the rooms in it are so dated. I feel that I did not get my money's worth. I assumed that the book would give me some fresher ideas than these. A real disappointment.
4,Not Bad,This book is vey informative if a little dry on the subject of women and women's rights. It went well with my History of Women class.
3,"OK for the price, I guess",The concept is great...if it were bigger and heavier it would be perfect. It really only holds one spoon at a time and a heavy or tall spoon can tip it over.
2,"Ambient Calm - it's alright, I guess","I bought this item to be played in a nursing home's dementia unit's dayroom. Some of the scenery was good because it involved some kind of visual stimulation (things moving) but the ones that were still did not serve their purpose. The music was also ok, but needed a little bit more variety. It was alright, but not awesome."
2,Frustrating,"Some of the scenes are OK. Three are computer generated with one being Lava Lamp meets Ghostbuster slime. Too many of the butterflies are ragged and the stream is artificial.What I most dislike is unless I play each scene seperately, the play is continuous and totally random. Some scenes played 5 or 6 times before a new scene appeared and maybe a dozen times by the time the last scene played.One review said there was an option for natural sounds, but my disc only plays contemporary, classical, or random music.Less than half the scenes are interesting to me for even one play. There are so many better relaxing DVDs in my collection I will probably toss this one."
2,where are the palm trees?,"I didn't enjoy this DVD because the front cover suggest a beach with palm trees. There was one scene with a palm tree lined beach at sunset and that was it. There are a lot of other nature scenes that don't appeal to me and if I could have seen the back of the DVD, I would not have purchased it."
3,"Nice, but US centric","Nice photography, nice text but too US-centric to deserve the title ""Ultimate book"" knowing that the worlds most interesting lighthouses are in Europe and this book only shows you US lighthouses (I have to admit, they are kinda nice too).If you are looking for a more comprehensive book there are other options."
4,VIRUS Review,"Interesting film even though it may be a B-type movie with a minimal budget. However, still not a bad film. Good action, simple plot, what do you expect with a budget under $10 million."
1,The worst movie of all time,"This is supposed to be an action/thriller movie, but yo will laugh like you never laugh before.. Why? because this is the most disgraceful movie of all time, for the script, the directing, the actors, and even the music.It's about a virus that contaminate a little town and makes pink bubbles on the top of a river. Everybody is contamined except our hero: Ken Fairchild. Why? because he have a cold...I don't tell you the end because it's too creepy. And there's lot of directing errors like when a car, for no apparent reason, explode in the air not one, but two times. I tell you that you should see this movie once in your life. After you'll be able t say:I saw the worst movie of all times. If you can stay in front of your tv for all movie long you'll be able to say like Ken:""Yeah, I succeed! """
1,Simply does not work!,"Just bought one of these and I tried it with about 7 different hard drives on three dif machines, and it did not work once!"
2,Bait n Switch Photos,Beware!!!The product in the Photo (as of 4-26-08) is NOT the product you will receive!You will receive a much inferior cheaper product.
1,A very good first try!,I did enjoy the book. I write short stories and know how hard it is to get a book done. Good continuity. Nice characters. I hope I will write as good as you Jimmy. Please write a lot of interesting books. And write them for a long long time.
4,"Very good book, I loved it","This book is very good, it is what I expected from the Chief Engineer of the Enterprise. ""Computer... show me the Enterprise, no A, no B, no C, and no bloody D!"", and the great S.M. Sterling, whose Forgotten Realms books were great. I liked this book so much that I read it Twice, it is not somthing I usually do, but I could not wait for the next one to come out so I read it again. I felt for the characters, and was suprised at who the Mollie spy was. Can you tell me when the next one will be out? Tom"
2,"The shampoo smelled nice, but if I didn't ...","The shampoo smelled nice, but if I didn't fully blow-dry my hair it left it frizzy and out of control. If I did fully blow-dry the shampoo worked fine."
4,great glass reference guide,This book tells you all about glass. If you are looking for firing schedules you might be disappointed though. Schott focuses on every other aspect of glass working I can find questions on.
1,Not worth the money!,"He goes round and round trying to use big words. Not only does he not understand what Paramedics are doing from day to day on the streets, he trys to analyze it on a psychological level. Not real readable. Best not to pay such a high price for a man who is still trying to write college term papers for a living."
1,Tangherlini has no business here.,"While I ordinarily welcome authors into the world of EMS as a method to document what happens, I find it abhorrent what this author does with the stories shared by the medics in this book. First of all, the book is not very readable. It is written like a college sophomore majoring in psychology would write a term paper. First the author gives the medic's story, then he dissects it (bluntly) giving his interpretations of the medic's attitudes, prejudices, and presumably, what the had for breakfast on their first day of school in the eigth grade. The author is not that perceptive and doesn't understand the field. His negative portrayals of EMS and opining destroyed what could have been (yet another) interesting body of EMS lore."
3,Pyrimid Retro Bullet Head Light,I bought this light mainly for it's looks and hoped it was more than a cheap flashlight powered by 2 c size batteries. My hopes were dashed. I guess you can't always get what you want. It's pretty though and It makes a good ornament for my motorized schwinn.
1,Cheap,Very cheaply made. Batteries would not fit correctly. Fixed the problem. Two day later it stopped working completly. changed tiny bulb. still not working. Do not buy. Get LED instead
2,WHAT! NO INSTUCTIONS!!!,Yes that's right both the chrome and the black colored light comes with no instructions. It comes with two brackets one to mount on a handlebar stem the other to the fork of your bike. The one that mounts on the handlebar stem is obvious to figure out how to install. The mount for the fork is not so obvious. When I called customer service no one had a clue on how install it on the fork. For a company that makes a decent cruiser this is ridiculous. If they don't think about a detail like putting instructions in a box for their customers then I don't think I will buy another Nirve product again.
3,Bicycle Headlight,"Its nice looking, not so bright but has NO instructions. At least an indication of what type of batteries would be nice."
3,Was It Worth The Struggle?,"Anthony Franciosa stars as a young actor who goes to New York with big dreams and, of course, finds that it's a lot harder to make it on the stage than he realized. Dean Martin co-stars as his director/buddy, Shirley MacLaine is the alcoholic daughter of a famed Broadway producer with whom both men get involved, and Carolyn Jones is a former actress turned successful agent. There's nothing in this material that is original or especially fresh, since it follows a basic plotline we've seen before. Franciosa comes on strong (and sometimes too strong) as the idealistic actor who must decide how much idealism he can afford. Martin is solid and understated, while MacLaine chews the scenery when allowed. Jones creates the most memorable character, mixing in pathos, humour, and a world-weary experience. It's not a bad film, but there's nothing here you haven't already seen. It can be a hard trip on your way to the top. It depends on how bad you want it."
2,Supermodel Yoga,"Christy describes her Living Yoga as a way to ""have your cake and eat it too"". Yoga is a path about ceasing a materialistic lifestyle and tuning into the spirit world. There was just something missing from her book. Christy isn't so much a yogi as she is a model who practices yoga. It would be much better to find a book like Be Here Now by Ramm Dass or something written by someone who actually went head first into yoga."
1,Buyer Beware,"Turlington's book is complete with addresses to many great yoga schools as well as a few lemons. I am a former member of 3HO which Turlington promotes throughout her book. Yes, I did yoga in 3HO, but I also suffered spiritual abuse and would not refer anyone to suffer what I suffered. Buyer Beware! Not all yoga schools are peace, love, and light once you become a devoted student.I do not think Turlington ever became a dedicated member of 3HO. Her promotional super -model status let her pass through 3HO without seeing the abuses."
3,Good ideas but too much about her...,"I wasn't expecting this to be a painfully in-depth account of Turlington's spiritual awakenings. While it had SOME good points, unless you are an avid Turlington fan you would do better with a different book like The Spirit of Yoga."
4,Comment on Editorial Review,"Just a note that Christy Turlington is *not* the first ""mainstream celebrity"" to write about yoga; Raquel Welch wrote a book on yoga back in the 1980s."
5,GO KRISTY!!!,i love this book it is well written and she includes pictures from her trip to india. it goes very well into explaing the zen of yoga. i had read about her book in vogue and decided to give it a try. im a beginning yogi and this book has been very helpful to me.
5,I love this book,"Thank you Christy for writing this. It is heartful to know that you are willing to share yourself in this way. I admire your perseverance in finding yourself out there, steeped in the material world. I like the personal tone you write with for finding your path, it gives me strength. Thank you for being real and being yourself."
4,Theres More to Yoga then the poses!,"I rated this book a four instead of a five for one major reason. The book's poses and postures arn't in a very clear order, and certainly not done by experience level. The book is WONDERFUL in discussing what lead her to yoga, medititation, and the history of yoga. Overall, I highly reccommend this book. As a poor college student, its cheaper then a gym membership and keeps SOME of the stress from school down :)"
4,A Real Inspiration,I loved this book by Christy! The pictures are amazing -- and made me realize that I still have a long way to go.I thought the way that she covered all the different aspects of Hatha Yoga was very informative. I've been a student of Yoga for over 30 years and I still learned some things I never knew. This is one book I'll be buying for my own private collection.
4,A Pretty Good Text for the AP Latin--Horacce,"This book contains all of the poems that is required on the AP Latin Test.It provides a brief introduction and summary along with a vocab-list for each poem. It also points out the significant and important figures of speech, literary elements, and grammatical construction.However, there is no translation to each poems. Translations are only available in the teacher's edition. The translation in the teacher's edition is pretty accurate and is kept as literal as it could be.There is an index, a glossary, a list of meters, and a list of literary elements and figures of speech at the back of the book. There is also a content page and a brief biography of Horace."
5,Works great.,"After purchasing a couple from PAC which didn't work correctly, I ordered one of these to try. Works perfectly. Sound quality is good and the charging works as expected. Fits VERY snugly into the iPod."
3,Not as pictured,"While I am happy with my purchase, be aware that of the two rings pictured, neither one is the ring you will receive. Seems a little misleading, to me."
5,The Bible for Real Estate,"Extremely good coverage of real estate transactions, from simple to very complex. Excellent analysis of tax aspects and tax shelters."
1,It's like a treatise on acquiring title to wild animals!,Madison goes on and on about silly grown men scampering after noxious beasts. Who has legal possesion? Who cares? After the first chapter I started daydreaming about the month I spent in Turkey held captive by a syphillitic transvestite ENT doctor.
5,this book produced results,"I ran for school board five times, and lost, then read Shaw's book and won on the sixth attempt - and beat the incumbent."
4,More appropriate for first-time candidates and novices,"I bought this book hoping to get some ideas and insights on grassroots organizing, but I was dismayed to find that the book is much more elementary than I anticipated. It seems like a good resource for someone running for school board or a small town's council. However, if you're looking for pointers on running/managing a campaign, you may be better served by another book, perhaps Daniel Shea's ""Campaign Craft."" The book also fails to address the increasingly important technological aspect of modern campaigning, recommending that you keep track of your supporters via index cards. While reliable, this method is not exactly on the cutting edge of the campaign industry."
3,yea it's okay,"Worth a watch and I did learn a lot about the big critters, like where and when, habits, etc. Feathers and all."
3,Essential Dinosaur Pack review,As with the other 2 films I reviewed earlier; the film was only okay. I have many such films and consider that not a lot of difference existed between the films even though the presentations were somewhat different from one another. Still if you don't have a large collection of these films they are all well worth getting. I did and I'm glad I did. If you have kids they could learn a lot from these films.
4,Interesting,Interesting new info. Visually impressive. My only complaint: too many people and not enough dinosaurs. My little ones get bored with it for this reason but will appreciate more later I'm sure.
2,Very disapointed,I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was so excited until we got to the second disc and it didn't work. The poor boy was crying and very upset. I can't return it cause i don't own a printer to print out the labels to ship it back. I will not buy from here again.
5,Do not confuse with Wilking With series...,"The Essential Dinosaur Pack is more than 8 hours of dinosaur programs by the Discovery Channel. Lots of dinosaur action, groundbreaking discoveries, dinosaur facts, stories and just plain fun. Great for the kiddies and adults and something that makes a great gift for anybody, anytime, anywhere. The shows cover everything from telling us the story of the T. Rex, and the mystery of how he lived his life, to the ideas of bringing dinosaurs back to life via the DNA of birds. Raptors, fossils and birds, this is a wonderful peek into dinosaurs and how we see them."
5,Very satisfied!,"When I first received my CW300 the FM tuner wouldn't work. I send an email to JetAudio and requested a replacement unit. My email and follow-ups were answered quickly (within a day or less) and I shipped my player back to them. I got the replacement within 6 days (!) and it is working flawlessly. Sound quality is superb and it has plenty of features. The software is very easy to use and I particularly like the accessories (leather case with belt clip, armband/armband case).All in all, a great product and outstanding customer service."
3,Quite limited,"It's quite limited. I should have liked it to include French, German, and Italian literary agents, editors and publishers."

1,Seymour MF-25 5 Tine Manure Fork,Needed a good quality made manure fork to turn the compost pile and for shoveling mulch.After researching different USA manufacturer I found the Seymour tool brand and after looking @ the company webpage I was impressed that the company had been in business since 1872Placed the order for what I thought was a AMERICAN made quality product.....What I received was a cheap forged steel fork with a MADE IN CHINA sticker stuck on it.Not what I expected after paying a premium price......
4,"I liked the Natural Ice Sport, Sunscreen/Lip Protectant ...","I liked the Natural Ice Sport, Sunscreen/Lip Protectant a lot."
3,Hard to open,This is okay but it is so hard to open the cap on it. I have problems with arthritis in my hands so I will not buy again!
5,Best lip protection ever made,"This is the best lip protection I have ever tried, and I have tried them all! It does not have a strong odor, it is not too waxy or too soft, and it lasts quite a long time. I spend a great deal of time out of doors in the winter, and I have not had chapped lips since I started using this product."
5,"If you use the product, then you know.","If you use Mentholatum Natural Ice, then you know how good it is. It is also very hard to find it in stock in Denver. Amazon has good pricing, and with Amazon Prime, we can get it when we want."
1,they sent the wrong one,they were out of the one i ordered. so they sent the wrong one. I called and they admitted they were out of the right one so they just thought they would send me something. I returned the product and they credited my account.
3,SFA,I was dissapointed to find out that online play is no longer available for this game. But my T.E. fightstick does work on it and aside from not being able to play online it's a great game and Third Strike is awesome!
1,Ok let me put it this way,Ok this game is only good if u want to get your A** KICKED.......but u know what even though I gave it one star overall It is still a good game it's just the difficulty levels pisses me off
2,...just falls short...,"I wasn't expecting a graphic overhaul or dazzling gameplay, but there's something about this version (Xbox) that just doesn't carry the same fond memories as the Genesis version did. The controls are just this side of flaky, and doesn't lend to that smooth action the Genesis pad carried. Don't buy this unless you are the most hardest of hard core fans."
4,There are picture books then there are picture books,"This one is a keeper. You can tell that Mr. Pflughoft is not only familiar but passionate about his subject. It's hard for amateur photographers to find new shots of Yellowstone, that's why it's fun to pick up a book like this. We can be inspired to keep trying. Yeah, they do it for a living because they're good at it!"
3,"Fun, but not great","Overall, this game was fun and enjoyable, although it is a rehash of things already done. Graphics and sound are good but not awe inspiring, gameplay is fun and quick. Once you completed it, there is little reason to do it again. After using multi-player, I found the game a bit easier in single player mode as you didn't have to share experience or gold so the single character gained levels and equipment faster than with multiple characters. This was a great game to rent, but I would never buy it."
3,Dull,I'm not exactly sure what makes this a D&D; game since there are no role playing elements to be found.the game is incredibly easy and not challenging to anyone over the age of 5.Graphics are just there.
1,way too easy!,"To be honest, I am horrible at playing video games. I usually can't go anywhere close to beating a game without many months of game play and the guide book.I beat this game in less than 12 hours of game play with no book and no help of any kind.No challenge at all for experienced gamers!"
1,Horrors!!!!!!,"In my opinion, this game is just simply horrible. Its a Gauntlet rip-off. It put it in...played for about 5 mins, and knew it was a trade-in. Haven't played it since. This game is great if you need something to catch the dust on your shelf."
4,Dungeons and Dragons Heroes,This game is great! Especially when you get your friends into it and they join you. It's one of the best xbox party games i own (with more than 30+ games in my collection) *brag* *brag* :) It's kinda like Asheron's Call for xbox (ok... maybe not quite) but the experience usage is very cool. My favorite characters are the warrior and the cleric. i wouldn't recommend starting out as a warrior because then you get in the hard-to-break habit of going up and slashing everything. this is very negative towards your carreer in either a wizard or rogue. Overall i'd give this game 4.5 stars! Try this game.
1,HORRIBLE,Dont buy too short unless you are the type of person that likes short games not recommended waste of 50.00 unless your a hardcore dungeons and dragons fan.
3,"good, but limited","I finished this game in three days... so there is not a lot to it. It is a real hack and slash type game, not a lot of character development in this one... it's the kind of game where your thumb gets sore. The view of your character would sometimes get obscured by walls, trees, you name-it, so that could be a bit annoying. The graphics are good, the sound is great, the effects are cool. You have an ""ancestoral weapon"", so you are not really encouraged to try others. I only did the one player game, so maybe the Xbox live aspect might make it a better game."
4,A fun game for cooperative play that holds up well.,"My wife and I enjoy completing cooperative games together, and we really had fun with this one. The single-player experience is admittedly weaker than the multi-player one, but if have people who will sit and play with you, I recommend this game."
3,worth the money,"used to love renting and playing coop with my cousin, not as good as i remember it but still fun."
4,Seems to work,"I will start by saying that I took this product for 6 days in a row. Followed 30 minutes later with fresh brewed clove tea directly before going to bed. The only reason I say ""seems to work"" is because unless I absolutely without a doubt saw something that looks like an unwanted ""guest"" and knew for sure that's what it is, then I can't say for sure and would hate to make a definitive claim. Even so, some of the symptoms I'd had been having that one would think of as maybe IBS have disappeared. I've been sleeping better. A lot less teeth clenching and itchy skin feeling. The reason I used the clove tea right after the syrup is because eugenol oil is derived from cloves. That has natural anti-helminthic and anti-fungal\bacterial properties. I'm testing the clove tea for moderate acne too at the moment. Definitely no adverse complaints so far! :-)"
1,If I'm lucky I'kll get a year out of this thing,My last wallet lasted nearly 20 years. I've had this one for a few months and it's simply falling apart.
5,Wonderful knee wrap.,This item fit great. Could walk and sit with no bulk plus it is very portable. Extremely happy with this item.
1,Terrible Product,"I'm surprised by people's reviews that this works great as a knee wrap. The product I received is a cheap wrap with a gel pack. The wrap does not completely cover the gel pack , which would leave a frozen (or hot) gel pack directly pressed against your skin. It also does not fit around my knee without using the extension, and by the time you add a cloth to stop freezer burn the whole thing falls apart. I could add a cloth around the gel pack, but surely when you order a wrap like this it should do the job completely without having to add anything. I am returning this product as it's a cheap useless waste of time. Don't bother, you would be better off with a compression sleeve and an ice pack, or taking a bag of ice, wrapping it a cloth and taping it to your skin, it's cheaper and more effective than this.I rarely review or return items but I'm SO disappointed in this product I felt I had to."
1,Don't like it,"The gel pack is fine, does not freeze and works as it should, but the blue wrap sucks, terrible product, not Practical, still need to use a towel to protect de skin from the ice burns and it does not strach...End up buying another one, truefit brand that works great."
5,love this!,i have to ice my knee after every workout and this works perfectly. it only needs a few hours in the freezer and it's good to go. icing my knee was always hard because i had to sit still and balance ice bags on top of it but now i can strap this on and walk around! i haven't tried heating it yet but i'm sure that's great too.
4,Stays cold for long,"As other reviewers say, it doesn't stay on when you walk around, but what would on a knee unless it is exceedingly tight?At first I did not think it was cold enough when I had pants on, especially jeans. I realized it takes longer than some packs for my knee to feel cold, but it then stays at a comfortably cool soothing temperature for a while.I recommend it."
3,Compress,"This was hard for my 15 year old to use. Everything looks ok, but of course you can't walk around with it (which you should be resting your leg). The gel pack is rather cheap, definitely not as good as we received from the Orthopedic doctors. Son just wasn't happy with it."
2,Awkward,"So I have a bad knee and need to ice down after my morning cardio. I wanted something that I culd fit on my knee while sitting, thought this was the thing. First it is just a strip, it is shaped in anyway to fit the knee. The gel which you put in the fridge to cool is oblong and not long enough to be held down properly by the blue wrap, oh and please what is that blue strip that is sent with it, I think to ensure the thing holds to your knee, it is useless too skinny. Finally, and I accept the safety element but it is awkward, you have to put a towel between your skin and the gel pack, and there in lies the challenge you do that and you have a hard time with wrapping the outer piece around your knee. In short do not buy this product for your knee."
4,"Looks good, but pocket only holds 1/3 of the gel pack..","Just received the Bewell Ice n Heat compress today anticipating use on our sometimes achy knees. Product looks well designed as confirmed by prior customer' reviews. HOWEVER, the inner pocket holds only about 1/3 of the gel pack. Is the gel pack supposed to be folded and then put in the pocket? If not, I can foresee some serious heat burns. Would appreciate comments/feedback from others. Thanks."
4,Works well,"Relif from pain, and able to walk around, if you use the elastic band that sometimes comes undone."
3,Bear USA 3&1 System Jacket,the hood on this jacket is not a complete hood. It is more of an extended collar with no drawstring or fastening device for full closure of the hood. Otherwise the jacket is an excellent cold weather jacket/parka.I am disappointed in the hood.
4,More like four hours though,"This is a great book for making a professional looking cake. I have never done a class but I managed the smaller version of the fairy castle cake. BUT no way could I do that in two hours. I bought a sheet cake and cut two rounds out of it so I had a very flat cake to start with. Making the decorations and putting it together took about three and a half. Also, you have to work over a couple of nights to allow the turrets to dry."
5,great French banjo!,"This is an unbelievable album. The cover is so ultra-American, the band could only come from another country. And they nail the genre--this is some of the best instrumental bluegrass I've ever heard. Colored Aristocracy alone is worth the price. I only wish they'd make another."
1,TOO CONFUSING.,"I love most of Judy Nayers books for their beautiful pictures. They are great to teach your little ones about many things. This book is too confusing. It has too many items on one page. It has Thunderstorm, tornado, hurricane all together and the pictures mesh together. It doesn't give a clear picture. I understand it is for a wide range of ages 2-8 years old. I recommend you look for another book to about weather."
1,Not happy at all,"Simply put, the cable never worked properly between my video camera and my MacBook Pro... I later tried a Sony cable, and everything went OK."
3,Good connection but delicate...,"Bought this to hook up our video camera to the PC. Found that the smaller end that plugs into the camera is quite fragile. The plastic cracked within the first few uses. The cable works fine, I just don't see the connector lasting much longer."
1,Pretty Beat-UP,The condition of the book was exaggerated. The seller claimed that the book was in good condition. The cover of the book was beaten-up and there was highlighting on many of the pages. Product description was poor.
4,This product met my conditioning needs. It attained ...,"This product met my conditioning needs. It attained the tangle-free results I wish for from a good hair conditioner. The scent of the product wasn't that appealing, however. I'd recommend this item to friends and family based on its retail price and great results in making hair smooth, shiny, and tangle free."
4,I wasn't sure about this product. I was ...,"I wasn't sure about this product. I was a little leery of trying it, but to my surprise I really like it. It smells wonderful. My hair is softer and silkier feeling. My 8-year-old wants to use it in her hair, and my 14-year-old daughter is next in line. It's a good product that I'd recommend to others."
2,"Flashy, but not very good at navigation..","I have this in my car, and my wife has a Garmin quest (older model ~$350). The pioneer works OK, but looses lock easier, and the database is not as up-to-date as the Garmin. I recommend carrying a phone book with you, since the database doesn't have many newer stores and locations. It also doesn't take you as close to your destination. Sometimes, it stops directing you about a half mile away. Finding stores and points of interest is difficult without the address. It does do a good job of navigating on freeways, with very nice diagrams of each intersection. It also has XM Nav-traffic as an option, and I do like how it informs me when traffic is backed up. If you really need the XM radio, and traffic, I would consider this GPS. If navigation is your primary function, you will be much happier with a garmin. The data for the pioneer is still 1.0, and the replacement data disks are $250. I can only hope the updates will be more affordable."
3,fighting,"this game is not exceptional in any way, and a major dissapointment in another. as a fighting game it is just that. as a fighting game from capcom it certainly is not. the characters are recycled from several titles through-out capcom's history. the sprites are also recycled making the look of the game seriously trucated. there is nothing new about this game, and even if you are a fan of fighting games there are other places to go. if you are a fan of the fiction that is capcom then that is the only reason to buy this game."
3,"Would everyone quit with the crying about this is Capcom's ""worst game""","...they have done worse. Now, to get down to business, there are a majority of disappointments that fanboys of Capcom are only looking at. I am ,by the way, a huge fan of all 2d fighters ,so I am not biased towards one franchise or another. This game had a great idea of bringing past games together to form an ""ultimate"" game. Yes, they should have put much more characters in ,but the ones on there are suffice. The gameplay is almost like SNK vs. Capcom 2,which is my favorite fighter for xbox, so there is a plus. Graphics are good ,but there is always room for improvment. More gameplay options would have helped , and it being on xbox live is another plus. I am not really a optimist ,but you all need to chill out and look at the bright side.kthxbye"
1,They're just on cruise control now...,"The only good thing you can say about this game is that the fighting isn't broken. But then, that's because they could do it in their sleep. And that's just what they did. Zero effort into making this the real exhibition of the greatness of their fighting game series that it could have been. Four characters each from five different games (plus two boring new ones) is not even an adequate cross-section of the variety of play-styles these games fostered.(...)You'll never find anyone to play this game online with, either."
4,Excellent Dictionary,Explains clearly the importance of Quantum Physics as it applies to life in general. Easy references.
5,Husband,"I had to get this one for my husband, especially where she is his favorite character of all time and he mad us name our daughter after her."
4,Offers insights on Asia&#65533;s businesses,This book is rich source of insights and perspectives for anyone with a business interest in ASIA.This book gathers every aspect of business related issues and offers case studies.I highly recommend this book; especially as a tool for expatriate CEOs and Managers who are working or have plans to work in ASIA.
3,emergency triangle,"This item will be good to use during those high fire danger summer nights when I would hesitate to use a flare. However, I was disapointed that they made it smaller than an average emergency triangle. The small size makes it less useful during the day than at night, when the led lights would help make it more visible."
4,Good for BASIC warning,"OK, this unit works great, I mean it has no flaws nor difficult to use. It flashes red LEDs fine and fits great on my trunk. The only thing I did not like is the SIZE of the triangle, it's just to small."
4,Great shoe...,"I love this shoe, it looks really good for casual attire with jeans or business attire with slacks. It isn't great if standing all day on your feet but is great for a shopping day. The shoe is true to size and is really comfortable. It was the first shoe from Skechers that I had bought and this shoe made me want to buy more. I bought the black pair first and loved them so much that I bought a white pair to wear with jeans."
5,Piece of Art,"I was surfing for a MP3 player for a long time. Finally I found the right one for me. It is so tiny comparing to other ones. Though I own all my electronic gadgets from SONY, I could not resist this one. I bought it directly from jetaudio.comAnd the sound effect is great... superb I should say. Let me conclude with just one last comment... CW300-256MB is HOT... Just get it... you will love it..."
2,Excellent Quality with a FATAL FLAW,"I have an I Audio CW-300. I have been using it (used exclusively for running) for well over a year and find the quality and battery life suberb. However, Any music that you purchase online is sold in secure WMA format, this format will not be playable on this device as it will require DRM compatible software which it does not have.If you plan on downloading music to listen to from the internet it will not download to your I-Audio. If I had known this I would not have purchased my I-Audio"
1,Instant return,"Within the first 5 minutes of opening the box (and installing the software) the player squeaked loudly in my ears and turned itself off. It did this several times. I replaced the battery, checked all the settings... and was rewarded with having the player turn off the sound (but leaving the power on) half the time, and just turning itself off the other half.And yes, I did check the auto-off function.Maybe I got a lemon, but I've lost faith in this product. Instant return."
2,Great Sounding but Unreliable Player; Poor Support,"At first I was very happy with this player, but it started malfunctioning after the first time I used during a workout. It took a long time to get a response from customer service (it seems to be handled entirely out of Korea), when the unit was finally repaired, it malfunctioned in the same way a few weeks later. Then the cycle continued (poor response, etc.).Be aware that the company rewards customers for posting positive reviews on sites such as amazon (they clearly state this policy on their website)."
3,Disappointed,"Not what I expected. The picture quality is not very good. The music is mildly jazzy and mildly country. Rhythms are upbeat, but annoying. The same songs are on the country version and the jazz version. Nothing sophisticated here. I probably would have loved this as a kid. It might be cute at a 50's-themed party."
1,hated it,"Really dissapointing, Loud, over done, nerve wracking. I generally like over the top Christmas dvds, but not this one. Options for Country or jazz xmas music, but no option for tradtional sound track. I liked the one I purchased last year, Christmas Lights Small Town USA . sweet, traditional, thoughtful."
5,They raised the bar.,"I bought the first volume of this series. This one is just like the title says ""Bigger Dazzling Displays"". I'm playing it at my party this year."
2,Cheesy,I didn't have high expectations but this DVD didn't meet them. It was on the order of a bad home movie. It went right into the giveaway pile.
2,Could be better,"The lights on the houses are great, but the music is lousy. If the music was more traditional and more lively it would have more stars."
3,About average - should use other resources too,"As a music teacher and professional musican I was hoping to have this text be an aid to my students. The printed music is clear, although the arrangements are not necessarily the best, particularly with regards to the 4/4 meter as opposed to the true alla breve. The cd that is included is a nice bonus, but it would have been nice to hear real instruments on the tracks instead of a synthesizer. The dance instructions are somewhat unclear. I had to refer to two other resources just to decipher what is meant. So, this is an average product, not to be trusted as a vailid source standing on its own."
1,Defective book,"This book would be fine, if the printing weren't defective. The pages are slanted, and not cut properly. I have had to rip un-cut pages apart. Because of that, and because I haven't had the time to pack the book back up and return it, I have been unsatisfied with my purchase."
4,The All Mighty Dollar,"The Summer of 1991, a perfect back drop for this tale of ordinary guys tired of being just ordinary. But just where does the chase of the all mighty dollar lead this crew of life-long friends from Queens?Holz the main character comes form a two parent home, has graduated high-school, has a job and a good girlfriend. But he will still fall to peer pressure and risk it all for material gain.I've read a lot of books about friends venturing into illegal activites looking for the come-up. But what differs in Mr. Anthony's tale is the reality of the outcome of such ventures. Is there a price to pay for the fast life? Come follow the Fourth Crew and find out.Excellent novel describing a very memorable summer in NYC and an unforgettable crew."
2,not impressed,i really didnt care for this book. i wouldnt say that it was a page turner b/c to me it wasnt. a lot of things made me mad about this book. i would have to say it was the mentality of the boys in this book. thats why i say that. the sad thing is thats the reality of todays world. it doesnt stop b/c the book stopped. A LOT of boys think like that. unfortunately their thinking doesnt change as they become men
4,DOUBLE CROSSED,I would like to say it was a very interesting novel based on the mentality of young men. I am just very upset to have purchased this book again. This novel was once called Urban Massacre which I read in 1998. Why was this novel published twice?
5,Love this book!,I loved this book as a child. It was one of my favorites! My mom recently purchased a copy for my son for Christmas and he loves it as much as I did.
3,Effective but pricey,"Overall I think it's a fairly nice mouse pad. The wrist pad is a bit firm for my tastes, and I don't use it very much (I never attached it to the mouse pad so I can remove it whenever I want). It's sometimes a bit hard to clean off because of the way the mouse pad is grooved. When it picks up crumbs it just doesn't brush off that easily. As far as the battery-saving surface technology, it's hard to say. I use a Logitech mouse which gets really good battery life so it goes a long time between charges. But I think I may be recharging the mouse less often. So perhaps it is extending the battery life some. I don't think it's anywhere close to 75% though. Maybe 10-20%. My biggest complaint is that while it's better than a $3 mouse pad, it's not $30 better. If it were less expensive I would feel better about recommending it. But for the price, I would probably pass on it."
3,It's Okay...claims to extend the mouse life.,"This mouse pad comes in several pieces which have to be stuck on before you use it. There is a big Velcro piece that has to be added on the top in order to attach the pad to the hard surface. Then you can decide if you would like to attach pieces to the bottom in order to adjust the angle and height(a positive and negative tilt). The ""gel"" pad is quite firm and covered in leatherette which my wrist tends to stick to when it is warm. I will say that the mouse surface seems to be more precise and rolls quickly and with ease. I will see if it extends the life of my mouse."
3,"comfortable, awkward attachment for the wrist pad.","I am happy with this adjustable mouse pad. It looks nice and is functional. When it comes out of the box you can add the feet yourself to make the mouse pad tilt if you want. they have places to make it either tilt at an upward angle, or downward angle. I find the upward angle very comfortable. Then you add the wrist pad on yourself, I am impressed with the cushion used for the wrist guard. It is all simple and easy to figure out. My main complaint is with the ""Velcro-like"" system used to attach the wrist pad to the mouse pad used is not easy to mesh together. Instead of the wiry material used in traditional Velcro, this is shorter, and more like tiny plastic bristles. This means it can take some pretty good force to to firmly attach them together so they do not slide off each other."
3,Custom fit - not adjustable,"The best use for this mousepad is if you don't use the height adjustments. If the height adjustments are glued on, you can not remove them if you plan on placing them back on at a later time. If you decide on using the height adjustments, the board will bend in time.The gel used for the wrist is stronger than any wrist supports I have had - and I have used at least 4 in the last years."
5,Great All In One Design,"Before I got this mouse/wrist pad, I had a mouse pad and separate wrist pad that was just like this one. The problem that I ran in to was that the wrist pad would stick to my wrist and end up out of place and I was constantly putting it back. I ended up taping it down with double sided tape and that worked well for a while. This one sticks to the mouse pad base with a double sided adhesive that comes in the box. I like the hard mousing surface better than my old soft foamy pad. It is easier to clean and tracks very well. The entire unit does move around a little on my slide out keyboard shelf but not much to bother me. I am about to double sided tape it too my shelf to fix that problem. I have had it for about a month now and am really enjoying it. The wrist rest really supports my hand better and I can tell a difference.Pros:Quality materialsEasy to cleanStays put (mostly)Just right sizeCons:None so far after a month of use"
3,The primary value is in the rigid mouse pad and wrist pad surface,"This mouse pad with wrist pad works just fine, though is fairly expensive. It's worth the additional cost if you have an uneven surface, or need the included supports that angle the mouse pad. For example, if you want something to use when sitting on a couch. The gel wrist pad is removeable, which makes it easier to pack.Overall, it's a good product that is worth the additional cost where a rigid surface is needed."
3,Lots of nice features but not the most comfortable,"This replaces an old gel wrist pad mouse that was falling apart. The 3M mouse pad has a lot of new features that I've not seen before.For one thing it tilts and depending on the size of the legs you add on you can control how much. It keeps your wrist nice and straight and seems to help with the wrist discomfort we can get from too much clicking.It's also antimicrobial, which would be especially nice for use with a shared mouse. It has a 'precise mousing surface', a micro-grooved surface that is supposed to extend the battery life of your wireless mouse by up to 75%.You have to glue on the feet for the height you want, and it seems like once they're glued you can't switch to the other ones. The gel pad is also very firm, much more firm then my previous mouse pad.It looks nice and tracks really well but it's not the most comfortable mouse pad I've used..."
2,Uncomfortable and Slippery,"This mouse pad is not for me. The wrist rest pad is very large and very hard, and I found it uncomfortable. The mouse pad itself has some nice non-slip strips on the back to make it stable on the desk--the problem is that once you put on the risers to give it a little bit of a lift on one end or the other, the non-slip strips are no longer in contact with the desktop and the mouse pad slips and slides all over the place. Because I was given this through Amazon Vine and did not have to pay for it, I will toss the wrist pad, and the little feet for lift and just use the mouse pad. Frankly, as it is, it isn't comfortable, or useful for me."
4,"Too big for my desk, but great gripper!","If you don't have an optical mouse, but the roller-ball style, this mouse pad is great. The light grey portion in the picture has a texture that grips really well, even with an old mouse. My mom passed down a comptuer to my kids, and we have to do the double-drag or shake to get it to register a lot. Since we started using the mouse pad, that has stopped. The wrist rest gets warm, which is a bit irritating, but I just put a washcloth over it. The only other ""complaint"" I have is that it's huge. We have a tray that slides out, and with the keyboard and the mousepad on the tray, one or the other has to hang half off the tray. On our bigger desk, that's not an issue. I just swapped out the mousepads and it was fine. Just make note of the dimensions to make sure yours will fit, too!"
2,Not very impressed.,"This comes with a confusing set of equipment and an equally confusing manual printed in many languages. Well - the bottomline is I did eventually set it up and tried to use it but it seems a little too industrial for use. I wouldn't recommend it. This is not my first GEL WRIST PAD for mice but this one is just not too good because it's not comfortable, easy to assemble and it doesn't add or subtract from my experience of using my wireless magic mouse. Therefore I see no reason to buy this. Thank you.What could the manufacture have done to make it better?I also have the ""3M Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest"" and that has a nicer softer feel although it is a dust magnet, it actually adds utility and ease of use. The whole area of resting the wrist doesn't do much for a home-user like me."
2,Wrist Wrestle!,"I've been using ""mouses"" for many years, since around Windows 95 or so, and this product continues the myth of the wrist rest.Do not rest your wrist on the pad WHILE mousing. The pad is for when you're finished mousing. The pressure on the wrist bones and muscles is not a good thing and could lead to carpal tunnel.101 Questions and Answers about Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: What It Is, How to Prevent It, and Where to Turn for TreatmentThe surface though is great, and the mouse runs smooth across it. There are optional pads to raise or lower this, but I did not try them out."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"I should preface my comments by stating that I am both a Mensan AND a long-time solver, constructor and editor of acrostic puzzles. Even though each puzzle is graded from one to four stars for level of difficulty, experienced solvers should have no problem with any of these. The puzzles themselves (quotation and word list) are interesting and feature a number of literary and movie/TV references. But, while the puzzles are of average length (85 to 115 characters), each one is spread out over two full pages. It would have been an easy matter to print one puzzle per page, thus giving us 80 puzzles rather than the 40 published here. Also, I believe most solvers would prefer an entire book geared to their solving level, e.g., all easy for beginners, and all challenging for experienced solvers. This book will cause some solvers to lose interest. Experienced solvers would do better to purchase a book of puzzles by Charles A. Duerr."
2,Mensa not so smart...,"Don't let the ""source"" fool you - Mensa may be intelligent but they're not so smart.This so-called spiral bound book does not lend itself to self-contained solving for two reasons: the binding does not easily fold back on itself to provide a firm writing surface and each puzzle takes up two pages so the book must be fully opened!Don't waste your money. The NY Times spiral bound book is a much better investment."
3,Thumbs down,"For a product attributed to Mensa, this is much too easya set of acrostics. Please update to a tougher level next time."
1,Astounding?,"I found these acrostic puzzles to be astoundingly unchallenging, especially considering that the book is billed as an ""Official Mensa Puzzle Book"". The puzzles are rated from one to four stars by difficulty, but even those with four stars are not much of a challenge. The most astounding thing about this book is that Mensa would lend its name to it."
5,i havent heard it yet but...,"hey hey, so i havent heard yet, but i ordered it...im just commenting on the ""offspring (sellouts) comment. who are you to say the offspring sold out? they werent sellouts, they were just over played, i promise you that if you hadnt been watchin mtv 15 hours a day (like every other teen out there nowadays) you would still be listenin to them like i am. to say the offspring sold out wouldn't be correct. sorry, and tanx"
3,Some Good Songs,"This CD is a good value considering it only costs a couple bucks, but for the price of a normal CD or even 7 or 8 bucks it wouldn't be. All of the songs are decent. AFI's ""He Who Laughs Last"" is the best song on the CD, and a great song at that. But the quality of the next best song is far below that of ""He Who Laughs Last."" More bands and maybe 15-20 songs instead of 10 could also improve this CD. The Offspring's previously unrealeased ""Hey Joe"" is another reason to buy this CD since it isn't on any of their other Cd's, but it isn't a great song or anything. Much like the majority of the songs, it is ""Pretty Good"" at best."
3,Can't Beat the Price,"I got this CD free at an Offspring Concert back in the days before they were REAL big. It rocks, worth the money. Saw AFI in concert with them, and the two songs on this CD by them showcases their sound great."
2,Short and Not So Sweet.,"There is not a whole lot to say about this CD,seeing as it only runs for about 20 minutes.I bought this Cd a long time ago mainly for the fact that it was really cheap.And frankly thats about the only reason worth buying it.The Guttermouth tracks are just childish and annoying (as is the singers voice).The Vandals tracks arent bad but they are just really your average Vandals tracks.Jugheads revenge is Ok,but its nothing really special.The offsprings Cover of hey Joe was average and Beheaded can be found on their first release (which you are better off buying instead of this).In My opinion AFI are the only band on here worth turning up loud,All 3 Minutes of Straightforward hardcore tinged punk.But yeah unless you are a desperate for the offspring cover song all the other tracks can be found on various albums.Buy it if you need to break a note for some phone change."
5,"Love this comp, love Jughead's Revenge","Yes, this album is short. Yes, there's only a few bands on it. I bought this about 11 or 12 years ago(probably at a Warped Tour) & I've been listening to it ever since, it's one of the few cd's I still own. I also personally like The Offspring's cover of Hey Joe, I also like the original. Jughead's Revenge, Guttermouth, & The Vandals are some of the first punk bands I started listening to. From there discovered the history of punk. I guess this is one of those comps you either love or hate."
2,NOT ENOUGH DIFF. BANDS FOR A COMPILATION!,"GUTTERMOUTH, THE OFFSPRING, THE VANDALS, AFI, AND JUGHEAD'S REVENGE...THAT'S IT...IN MY OPINION YOU NEED MORE BANDS ON A COMPILATION...THE MUSIC WAS OK BUT NEEDED SOMETHING ELSE...I DON'T KNOW...NOT REALLY FOR ME"
4,Really great CD,I like this CD because it's fast and there are great bands on the CD. Vandals and Offspring rocks hard. Buy it.
2,Candy bars were almost all cracked,"I love Mr. Goodbars, so they weren't the problem. However, either in the warehouse or in the shipping, the candy bars were cracked in 2 or 3 pieces. There are also subtle signs that they have been heated up and cooled, but not so much as it affects the taste."
1,i new this was going to happen,"what the heck,i wanted this before Christmas. Now i cant give it to people and get it to these people on time lol"
1,"Torture, pure torture",This was the first book I've ever read where I didn't give a hoot what happened to the main character. I'm all for despicable characters that you love to hate but this is a character you just plain hate! I too had to force myself to finish this book. Blech.
2,Great idea...poorly executed,"Being a celebraholic myself, I was excited to find this book and settled in for a weekend of happy reading. However, this book quickly grated on my nerves. I just hated the main character. I found her boring and repetitive. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars was because of the cute Celebrity Spotting Tips & Responsibilities of FOCs (Friends of Celebrities). Don't waste your time."
2,I'm sorry but this book failed to excited me!,"I was so looking forward to reading this book! I am the type of girl who gets a thrill from InTouch magazine and the newly revamped Star Magazine. I watch E! to become more educated in the lives of celebs. So I was really happy when I got a hold of this book.Maybe it was just a mood I was in, but I couldnt get into this novel. It had such fabulous potential but failed to engage me. I had to put it aside to page through People Magazine."
4,Celebrity Junkie Gets a Life,"This quick-read book tells the story of a young woman obsessed with the lives of celebrities. She reads all the magazines, watches all the TV programs and hunts for the latest gossip. Ultimately, she realizes that she doesn't have much of a life...she merely watches the lives of the more famous go by. This not-too-serious book is a fun read and the author tries to provide ""self-help"" tips for giving up the obsession with celebrities. Of note, the tips are presented with cute drawings and in side bars which help keep your attention.I wouldn't hold onto this book forever, but I will pass it along to my friends to enjoy. It would also be a good book to bring on vacation."
2,Just for picking on somebody's nerves,"Ok, this album is no good. I just bought it because my former girlfriend (now my wife) really hates the song ""barbie girl"". All things being equal, the album has too little songs, and they are not the best choice. Trash your money in something else!"
5,a wicked roundup of 2000 - the year of UK garage,"Ministry of Sound have put together a host of the most influential and popular garage tracks of 2000 all on a double album entitled ""UK garage the album"". This album makes use of the more commercial garage tracks of last year, and less of the underground material, which makes it perfect for those of you who want to see what all the shouting was about in 2000. I promise you that if you like the sound of a hybrid style of music that combines both the smooth vocals of R+B, and the bass and beat of house, then take a listen, you won't be dissapointed."
2,Identifying marks on the backs of several dominoes,"Several dominoes had marks on the the backs of them, making them identifiable (like many other reviews have said here). I contacted Cardinal regarding this issue, with the specific dominoes with problems, and never heard back from them. I returned this item and will be buying a set from a different manufacturer."
3,Not as expected,"I ordered these thinking they would be like the jumbo game I played with. The colors are muted and not vibrant. It would be difficult with any one person who has color sight issues to differentiate from lavender to grey. I acknowledge that the dots are there and you can go by them, but with children, the colors are important."
3,not as expected,The colors are not as vibrant as the box making it difficult to see the various colors unless you have a light shining right overhead. My tiles arrived as though they were used and re-wrapped in shrink wrap. They had marks on them as though used and were not clean and smooth as brand new dominoes. I would consider returning them for a better set from a different manufacturer with better color contrast.
5,More than happy,I bought these because we have a Mexican train/ chicken foot game. Mexican train uses double 12's and chicken foot double 9's. We did not want to have to dig out the right domionoes when we played chicken foot so this was a purchase for convience. these are heavy well made dominoes and I am sure will stand the test of time. We have been investing in several games to build up our game chest. This set will be used as much as any of the games we bought and I am happy with the purchase.
4,dominoes,"this is a good quality dominoe set, with different colours for each number and large white dominoes."
3,OK for the price,This product is just OK. The set was complete and it shipped quickly. The only negative I have to say is that the black dye from the dominoes came off and spread on the dominoes. It makes them look dirty.
4,Fun with Dominos,"This is great, my kids are having fun with Dominos like I did as a kid and they love lining them up and knocking them all over. Hours of fun."
2,post,Bought on behalf of family member. Was very happy with them. Main problem would not deliver to UK so had to go via friend in USA at huge expense
5,Problem in the book,"The example on page 296 when executed, Visual Basic gives General Protection Fault But this runs through Test Container"
4,Gives one a real clue! (Actually 4.5 stars),"This book was the one that unlocked the ""mystery"" of COM for me. I find that it and other WROX beginner books are good when you've read the technobabble of others and still need more of a feel (and examples!). After reading this book, one can go back to the theoretical, intentionally intellectually impressive books for the rest of the story.The only downside was that there were no really detailed C++ examples (e.g., a COM object using another COM object)."
5,Very Good Start for ATL,This is a very good book on ATL.This book gave me confidence of programming with ATL.It deals with ATL Architecture to using Windows controls in ATL framework.
4,very good hands-on book,"This is a very good hands-on book. I read it with Inside COM. The two books make a good pair since Inside COM is more academic. Beginning ATL COM Programming made developing ActiveX objects very easy and understandable. I am looking forward to the ""professional"" version."
2,I am sure there are better.,"Chapter 2 was just way too intense. It threw way too much at you, way too fast. I was left feeling overwhelmed, and frustrated. After reading chaps. 2 and 3 four times, I was able to proceed, but chapter 7 proved a disappointment when the example wouldn't work. I even downloaded the code off the site, and checked the errata online, to no avail. When the samples don't even work...well that's never happened to me before. It just didn't work.I was sticking with the book, because although it wasn't ideal, it was getting the job done. But I am fed up. I am shelving the book, and looking for something else now."
2,Definitely not for BEGINNER...,"The ""Beginning..."" in the title is really misleading . This book is not for beginners . I did not even get past chapter 1, and this is from someone who feels very comfortable with VC++ and MFC ."
2,Wait for an updated version,"This book was targeting VC5.0/ATL2.0. Some examples badly work with VC6.0/ATL3.0 : especially creating - and destroying ! - a modeless dialog box in an exe server, and connection points implementations when client and server are ATL based.I also agree with other readers about the rather convoluted organization of this book, and the strange mix of simple explanations and deep thoughts on ATL that keep me confused about its usability."
2,Not for beginner,Chapter 4 ATL Architecture is terrible. It's not for beginners. I almost give up from here.
1,Not for beginner,"This book is not for a beginner who wants to learn ATL Com programming. It is badly organized. Sometimes a reader will not know what the author is talking about. Especially for a beginner. If someone wants to learn something about programming Atl Com, read other books instead this one."
2,A reasonable COM reference but too technical for beginners,This book fails in its task to be for 'Beginners'. I actually found the more advanced 'COM Applications with ATL' book a much easier read.Way too much hard technical facts and not enough simple explanations or higher level concepts.The first Professional Series book I found a disapointment.
1,"Pan. Obtuse, obscure, incoherent definitions","I found the book obtuse. I still don't know what COM is or what it's good for or what ATL is or what it is good for. I found it amazing that I could work through the examples, compile and execute the example code, and still be mystified. The lack of useful definitions of the obtuse terminology doesn't help either."
2,Very confusing!,"The book is presenting a lot of stuff, but the way the information is organized, is very confusing. Totally unrelated subjects are bundled under the same chapter! Also, the authors keep using all kind of words without ever explaining them. On the bright side, the examples do work and you get a sense of what is going on."
2,VERY Confusing,"This book was very confusing for me, and I am VERY fluent in C++/MFC. The authors used a LOT of really big words that I had no clue what they meant, without defining what they meant. I feel like they didn't sufficiently explain some of the core concepts, such as what an interface is, what a method is, why you would have 2 interfaces in 1 COM componet, etc... The chapters were too long and should have been broken up into more short chapters. They covered several subjects in each chapter. I think that the authors are very bright people who understand COM very well, and when they wrote this, they read it and said, ""That makes perfect sense..."" without having any newcomers read it."
1,yuck,"this book is horrible. i find it hard to believe that grimes contributed to this book. whether you're a beginner or not, check out grimes' excellent book ""professional dcom programming"" instead."
2,Not a beginner book,"I got about half way through it and found myself skipping more than reading. Few examples, too much talk about obtuse data structures that even after the description I was left wondering if it was important. Just not enough teaching. The authors need to learn a key axiom of writing: show don't tell. Might be a good reference book, however.Chapter 2, learning basic ATL was great, but after that the book went south. If you are new to COM or ATL try another book."
2,Poorly organized and realized,"To much digging needed to find the few jewels here. The organization of the material is what hurts this book most. In chapter 2, after a brief intro into ATL and COM, they launch into the implementation of an ATL client, which consists (I'm not making this up) of running the ATL wizard and then deleting most of the output! It doesn't get any better further along, either. I recommend reading another title. Any other title."
5,Stunning layout and classic recipes beautifully documented,"As an historian of sorts i appreciate the authors research and diligence 'getting things right'.Not that I am big on the era but the care and perseverance of presentation and supporting information make the whole thing a delight. I originally borrowed thru the library but then had to have my own copy- and bought two to make a gift to an associate also a keen home cooking.Highly recommended,cheers dave"
2,Nothing Original Here,"When I saw there was another in the series for the Fashion Week disks, I couldn't order it quick enough! My husband owns the other 2-disk sets, and if you listened or own any of them, you'll immediately realize this one is different. With the Fashion Week name on it, I expected to hear rare tracks and music I have never heard before. Although I have never heard any of the music on this album, except the track from ""Earth, Wind & Fire"" nothing felt 'new', 'fresh' or like I hadn't heard it all before. At least with the first 3 sets, you could imagine models strutting down the runway being hip and cool! On this one, it just sounds like any other R&B collection, nothing that really moved me."
4,Fun for Beat Fans,Thoroughly entertaining cash-in on the Beat phenomenon. But who is the guy on the front cover between Ginsburg and Burroughs? Am I missing something important here that a Beat fan should know?
1,"Typing, not writing","The topic is fascinating, but this book is so poorly written and poorly edited that it's a wonder it was published at all. The author has few insights, writes repetitively, and seems to have forgotten details that occurred in his life almost 30 years ago when the events described are said to have taken place. I love the Beats and find both Ginsberg and Burroughs inspiring; it's a shame Kashner fails utterly to capture their importance as writers and people. Better to read them in the original than this shlock."
4,The 20th Century Year by Year,"This is a three-volume history of the 20th century starting with the Boer War in 1900 and continuing to 1999. After seeing 'Downton Abbey' on PPS I began reading the first volume starting with 1913. I knew the Granthams were in for some big changes. I keep reading to 1933, and then searched for the second volume. I found a nice used copy on Amazon.com and I am now reading about 1934. Martin is quite good at selecting the highlights (and lowlights) for each year. In about 15 pages he describes the big political events around the globe, disaster like fires and hurricanes and signs of human progress. His writing style is serious and light-hearted at the same time and a pleasure to read."
4,For Bio Kids,"I'm only a senior, starting grad school in the fall. Clearly written and well organised, and the advice in this book certainly seems sound - grad students and profs have told me much the same things. However, although it claims to be for the sciences, what they really mean is biological sciences. It was a bit difficult, starting to read this book thinking it's for everyone and then realising that it has an enormous bio slant and that you have to weed out 'irrelevant for physicists' bits all the time. There's a few token physicist quotations, but so what? That's why it's getting 4 starts. Otherwise, quite good...."
5,I Loved It!,".... I [also] received a Ph.D., and found this book to be atrue-to-life portrayal of what graduate school is about, touching uponall important issues--both positive and negative (and it is a smallbook!). It brought back a lot of emotions. I regret that it wasn'tavailable when I was a student--it would have made the experience somuch easier."
2,Just Mediocre,"Yes, the price is great, and they look good. But the build is flimsy, and the fit is a bit loose- they don't feel secure on your head. Also, they are VERY dark in terms of the amount of light they let through, which could be taken as a positive or negative."
1,Horrible.,Trust me...please trust me. These are the worst pair of glasses I have ever seen or purchased. I understand I didn't pay much for them...but WOW. It is a cheaply made plastic/metal construction that will break with a single drop. I at least expected to have a poorly made glasses that looked decent but I didn't even get that. These things are so cheap that anybody who sees them will know you either got them out of a candy machine or are wearing them as a joke. Don't waste your money!
1,cheap,These are the cheapest sunglasses I've ever seen. They aren't even worth $1 in my opinion. The frames are made of plasic and the lenses are too dark. Don't waste your time with these.
4,ok,just got them in the mail today. the mirror finish scratches very easily. so if your ruff on sunglasses this might not be the best pair to buy
5,great glasses,these glasses are great they arrived well packaged and in a timely manner i really like the glasses they fit well are comfortable and look great highly recommended much better than paying alot for ray ban
4,Decent Looking 'Cheap' Sunglasses,"I bought two pairs of these. Kept one and gave the other to may Dad. We both enjoy them. They look fine and are great for the beach, throwing around in the car, etc... You should not be purchasing these with the expectation that they are going to be identical to brand name though as they definitely aren't."
4,good,these shades can be described as hot and cool. lol. only thing is they are a little on the weak side. and they can get smudgy. don't know if this is important but the lens is like a mirror; you can use it to fix your face! lol.
5,Funny as an illegal Rush drug deal.,"Unlike most of the negative reviews here, I actually read the book. Anyone with a ""fair and balanced"" interest in the truth should read it as well.Funny, frightening stuff."
4,I can tell why people on the right hate this book,"Here's the thing. Al Franken makes some very good points about the conservative media and the lack of any liberal media at all. If American's want to here what's actually going on in Iraq then we're better off listening to the BBC than watching CNN. While not full of the newest material, its very entertaining reading Al's take on it all and its a good read no matter what side of the political spectrum you fall on."
3,funny yup! disturbing up!,I just got this book and read it very quickly. It is not hard to read and I have to say that there are parts that made me laugh because it was funny. But I had complaints because there are some disturbing conclusions that are hidden underneath all the humour. Why can't we have a balanced book about current events for once???
3,Disappointing but instructive.,"I was disappointed but I think that I was expecting Franken's usual searing humor and irony. This is mostly a rant but it does have moments of instruction. I especially appreciated his instruction on how easy it is to check the facts that we tend to swallow whole hog from the media. I will never read or listen to a 'news' story at face value again. With that said, I will say that I was surprised at how heavy handed Franken's humor was. I have greatly enjoyed him in the past, especially his very funny ""Why Not Me?"" book of his campaign for the presidency. That was hilarious - this is mostly a screed against the right with little humor which may be the point but I expected more."
4,Franken's a wit and writes a decent book,"I thoroughly enjoyed the dissection of the conservative pundits such as Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly (alleged independent), and others. Al is definitely going for some laughs and the book is indeed funny. As a political op-ed however, he doesn't put forth why he thinks the right are just lying, racist hate mongers and why his alternative is better. He simply enjoys attempting to make them look foolish. If you like to bash the righ wing, this book is for you. If you want a ""Fair and Balanced"" look at the right, then you need to look elsewhere. The one think I enjoy about Al Franken's books are that they are funny. I don't think it's the place to go to learn. It's kind of like thinking the ""Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" is a serious news program.Anyway, the books is fun, so liberals, enjoy."
5,Your Real Freedom,"It's about time someone painted these cartoon cowboys into the sunset they deserve. Let's look forward to an awakened populace to kick these hawks back out to their fear mongering oil/power/profit sniffing range with the prairie dogs & other endangered existences, like the freedom of thought, choice & speech, that they so cleverly suppress in the name of Freedom & Security.Congratulations to Al Franken for taking on the ""Ivory Tower"" of the extreme right in such a fun, informative and entertaining manner."
5,This Book is what our country needs right now,"as an antidote for the horrible Treason by Ann Coulter, there is Lies, and the Lying Liars who tell them, a hilarious but always right on the mark observations from Al Franken on why the conservatives are lying liars. And he proves they are. VALID proof. Unlike the 'proof' of rapid conservatives which is finely crafted LIES. That is why they are the lying liars featured on the cover of this book."
5,Feels Soooooo Good...,"...giving it back to the right! Franken offers some first-rate take-downs of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and other conservative targets. Cheap, easy shots, but don't they just make you wanna cheer? ..."
4,"Good for liberals, bad for conservatives!","God told Al Franken to write this book. Granted it didn't arrive on clay tablets, but Franken does recount his conversation with God to write the book, which is a pretty funny bit.Whether or not you find the rest of the book funny will obviously depend on 1) your political views 2) your level of humor (i.e. do you like Al Franken or not?) and 3) your religious views.Nice to see that Al Franken won the lawsuit brought against him by Fox News over the usage of ""Fair and Balanced"" in the book's subtitle."
2,Whatever you say Al,"Read this book if you:1) Believe in paying higher taxes.2) Refuse to take responsibility for your own actions.3) Think it's fair to take money from people who actually work for a living and give it to people who are too lazy to work.4) Wish this country was more like Cuba.5) Actually believe that Bill Clinton was an honest man with high morals.6) Are totally ignorant on how the electoral college works and thinks Bush ""stole"" the election.I find it ironic that a washed-up ""comedian"" is one of the leading voices for the left. The title for Mr. Franken's book is also ironic considering he wrote an apology letter to Attorney General John Ashcroft, admitting that he was not truthful when he previously sought Ashcroft's views on abstinence."
1,This Guy is a Complete Idiot,"This is an absolute piece of garbage. Al and friends are getting upset and have taken to name calling (you know that wonderful thing liberals do.) They are upset because the new conservative movement is unstoppable.Al, face it. We will take back our country and get back the principles we were founded on. We are tired of worrying about offending everyone for every thing. It's gotten old, so give up. Your liberal views are NOT going to be followed anymore!!!!!!! People are tired of being told what is good fo them. It's time we all take responsibility for ourselves."
1,Al Franken is a big fat idiot!,This book is going to elect John Kerry President?!!! Ha Ha Ha! Osama bin Laden and his cronies would love it!
1,garbage,"Especially the section about Clinton raping Juanita Broderick....what was he even trying to say, he just split her lip in two, but didn't rape her? What an idiot."
1,Liberal Bias,"Franken's book parrot's the eternal liberal mantra. Socialism is good, capitalism is bad; liberals (aka Democrats) are good, conservatives and morally decent folk are bad; hating the U.S. is good, being patriotic is bad; liberal Jews and Christians are good, conservative Christians are evil; Clinton is g_d, Bush is Satan. Enough already! Franken and this book are obnoxious.."
1,What a joke!,"This book is absolutely horrible! I though I was getting a ""fair and balanced"" view of the true liberal side and all I read was wicked nasty horrible one-sided fanatic nonsense from someone who cannot write. I was going to take this book to Goodwill, but I decided no one else needed to read this garbage. So I tore out the pages and burned it in my barbecue grill. What a joke!"
1,Don't waste your money,Horrible... The usual gibberish from the left. How can you ever trust what they say? There are no facts to back up his claims.
1,Please stop,"Most authors need credentials of expertise before they are published; why does this time-honored tradition not extend to Hollywood types? Franken wasn't funny on SNL, and he is not funny here, no matter how desperately he tries. He obviously considers himself a political pundit, but he only comes across as a fool. Since he considers himself to be so erudite, he should run for office, get himself elected, and fix everything...he would likely fare as well as Gary Coleman did in our California recall..."
2,This book is a lie but so are many of the conservative books,"It is clear from this book and other political that liberals and conservatives are BOTH guilty of lying about each other.I have documented many cases of liberals lying about conservatives. Some of those are in this book, some are from the websites of liberal lobbyist groups.I have seen conservatives ""lie"" about liberals also. It all falls down to definition of the word ""lie""My definition is when one deliberatly makes a statement that they know to be false. Under this definition, the liberals tell the most lies. The only thing is that liberals mix their lies with truths to make them more believable.The conservatives also tell lies on occasion but it is often based on misinformation."
2,Some Redeeming Entertainment Value,"The reason I gave the book 2 stars instead of one is because it does offer some entertainment value. Most of it came from laughing each time Franken's supposed evidence vs. Ann Coulter or some other conservative crumbled in the face of a little fact checking. Case in point: Franken is 100% wrong on the Even/Norman Thomas issue. Coulter said Norman Thomas was the GRANDfather of Evan and indeed he is. In fact all of the 'evidence' Franken, and his crack team of Harvard self-admitted activists, presented in his attack on Coulter's ""Slander"" was either dead wrong or just a product of his inability to take a joke or understand sarcasm, irony, and hyperbole. And Al Franken is a comedian? I suppose he is but only if you consider a Circus clown a comedian since I find myself laughing at them in much the same way."
1,Al's Big Lies and the lies he tells...,"There is not much to say about Al Franken except that he is a in his own little universe. He skirts issues, distorts reports, quotes media biases, and makes up the rest. This book is a joke and a laugh a minute...but that is about all..."
3,Funny But Wrong,"I'll admit it. Al Franken is hysterical. He's really funny. I've never taken issue with him as a comedian. I'm able to laugh even if I don't agree with someone's politics. I read this book because I wanted to see the other side. I'm sorry I did. While his cause may have been noble, the book was severely hypocritical. While he bashes Ann Coulter for name calling, it seems to me, he has the market cornered. He didn't make much of a case for documenting anything he said either. Ane he does a real good job of taking things out of context in order to suit his argument. If the book is read with the thought in mind that it's funny, it will satisfy the reader. If you are looking for a true, intelligent, political discourse... try somewhere else."
1,No better than Ann Coulter,"Al Franken's shrill screed is no better than Ann Coulter's unhinged rants. If Mr. Franken is trying to brand himself as the new voice of the political left, then he should invest in singing lessons. I read this looking for a few laughs at the expense of the right. What I got was a smug rant by a limousine liberal. Franken is no better than his counterparts on the right."
1,Please it hurt my eyes to read it,Same silly no fact propaganda we get from either party when they think they smell blood in tha water a complete waste of a few hours
1,Franken's Lies on Lying,"Al Franken, who is one of the most venomous and hateful men in America today doesn't disappoint here. Where he left off in schoolyard name calling in his first book, he picks up here. He picks and chooses parts of facts, combines them with other partial facts and comes up with a whole new truth. He doesn't just try to set his side of an argument, he has to insult and degrade those who believe differently (Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity, etc.). Franken has to be the most dishonest psuedo-intellectual around. I can't believe I wasted the time reading him!"
4,Buy this book...even if you're a right winger...,"I am utterly dumbfounded at how efficient the right-wing lie machine works. Unfortunately, there are too many morons willing to just gullibly swallow it down. This books seems to just start exposing the tip of this iceberg. My only negative comment about the book is that I found myself wanting more substance and depth on items such as the fiscal ineptitude of the current administration and more about how they're pushing religion down everyone's throats through various quiet legislation maneuvers."
4,Entertaining for liberals; probably not for conservatives,"It's not going to change your mind about anything. I consider myself liberal, and I do enjoy seeing right-wing squawk boxers taken down a peg (for a change). The point of this book is to be CLEARLY partisan (and get some comedic mileage out of it) so to view the book as a political manifesto is a mistake. I'm not naive to blindly trust all of Franken's ""facts"" anymore than I'd trust Ann Coulters or Bill O'Reilly's. But it's nice to know I'm not alone in my loathing of them.Conservatives have no reason to read this book other than to get themselves mad at liberals. If that's your thing, go for it. For liberals, it's pretty self-serving but at least it's fun."
2,An Ocean of Cruelty,"We read through this book and wept when we were done. Does Franken really have so much hate inside of him? With its unabashed racism (""Irish ape-man"",), distortions(""funny bias"") and savage personal attacks on people in the news and politics we've grown to love, despite their faults, the book really disturbs the reader's inner soul. It has totally bad vibes. I had to meditate for much time to calm the Great Spirit Within after reading. O.K., maybe not everything everybody has said in the news is true. But life's too short for it to really make a difference. Wake up, read a book, see a painting, take a walk in the park-just enjoy life. Things aren't as bleak as Franken makes them out to be. Can't we all just get along?"
1,al franken,Al Franken is not only a horrible actor but a horrible american. Why dont you and all your liberal communist friends try living in China or under Sadam's rule for awhile.You wouldnt last 1 month.
1,The Wimpy Wimps,"After reading this book, we can take Democrats even less seriously. Kinda like when you hear liberals say they ""support the troops"" - talk about lying liars (you know they secretly don't support the troops purely for political reasons). But that's the essence of this book. Democrats are compelled to say things they don't really believe, or in most cases just make it up, as in Franken's analysis of the Wellstone memorial. You'll never hear Republicans say they ""support the troops"" because you KNOW they do.Al Franken and friends are the whiners in the peanut gallery, petty armchair quarterbacks who have nothing constructive to say. But they would just rather ""do something"" (whatever that means), i.e., spend their time wallowing in their hatred of Bush."
1,Pfft,Franken is a hack who has no talent. He has it in for O'Reily and other Republicans because they know he's a hack.
1,Worthless Dribble,"This has got to be the worst book ever written. If you buy it, do so only to throw it in the trash before anybody could possibly read it."
1,Makes a good doorstop!,Remember the days when Al Franken was funny? Me either! I guess some things will never change.
1,WWW.FRANKENLIES.COM ... Decide for yourself ...,WWW.FRANKENLIES.COM ... Did Al and his 14 Harvard researchers really get all their facts right? Decide for yourself! The results might surprise you.
5,A great book,"Not only did I find it informative, I was laughing out loud. Al Franken presents an intriguing view on the conservatives and the lies we are fed by them, and can keep it funny while he's at it. I'd recommend this for a laugh and for a good liberal read."
1,"There's lies, damn lies and then there's Al Franken","This book reminds me of the Rambo movies, entertaining but based on ignorance and a mean spirited premise. Buy this one for your favorite non-thinking liberal friend. I guess what hit me most about this book was that the slurs and venom, while wrapped in humor, were not to inform. This this lowering the bar on political dialogue. If you must read this, wait for a copy to be open at the library. Don't put money in the pocket of hate mongers whether they be on the left or right."
1,It's good,"It's good for the liberals, but for the rest of the world it's a bunch of crap smeared onto white pages with white paint to cover it up. The guy makes John Kerry look good!"
1,More Lies than those he accuses of being liars,"It's hard to believe that an apparently intelligent person such as Franken can be so consumed by jealousy or hatred for how the conservatives have captured the hearts of America that he stoops this low. Franken has been exposed for not telling the whole truth in his accusations, but his targeted readers will probably not care. This was not worth my time of $. I'm very disappointed."
2,Great marketing campaign,"Barbra Streisand has a spectacular singing voice. The Dixie Chicks sing catchy songs too. Harrison Ford is my favorite actor. And 20 years ago, Al Franken was amusing on late-night TV. But I wouldn't pay any attention to any of them when it comes to economics or politics or foreign policy.I don't think Franken wrote this book himself, and I wonder how many of these books have been ""bought"" only to be stacked unread in warehouses. Just make sure to read the next book pointing out the ""lies"" in Franken's book: after all, Franken says he put pictures of the liars on the cover of his book . . . and look who's picture is the biggest.But hey, 2 stars for successfully baiting O'Reilly and Fox into suing, and a successful marketing campaign to the faithful."
1,Why,"A nasty little book by a vile, bitter little man. If I only believed in book burning, I'd know what to do with it."
1,NOTHING BUT LIES AND DISTORTIONS,"Taking his usual rabid dog aproach, Al Frankin shows he has not a shred of wit or intelligence in him. He usues his usual distortions of the the truth in lambasting the right. Nothing but an emotional temper tantrum witout a shred of logic."
1,Whines and the whiny whiners that bore us,"At first I thought this was funny but it gradually went down hill. Easy targets all the way around .... people even the farthest right consider wackos. But then the filth started .. foul, filthy language - yeah, Al, sit there so high and mighty trying to pull yourself off as an intellectual - did you tell your mother the Elton John joke? Good old Al loved to highlight the basest behaviors of his targets and yet was just so base himself. This guy is a ranting moron every bit as dangerous as Ann Coulter."
1,Lesson for ALL YOU CHILDREN,There is no liberal conspiracy. There is no conservative conspiracy. Just differing highly ignorant and uneducated points of view. A pox on all your houses.
4,Franken's best book,"Yeah, this book was kind of a ""must read""; a little bit over-hyped and a little bit over-exposed. But I was not disappointed. It rings very true and it's genuinely funny. Best Franken book yet, in my opinion."
1,Opinions are like ...,"My Granny always said, ""Opinions are like ass holes ... everybody's got one."" Franken's got his opinion, I've got mine, and don't forget, you can have your own - not the one he tells you to have!"
2,Bitter,Bitter as a overweight divorcee compaining that her husband did her wrong. Al trys very hard to be funny and it would be funny except the people who he defends brought us 9/11. After the slaughter of thousands of Americans all humor about these people is lost on me.
5,The book FOX news did NOT want you to read!,"I am really enjoying this book...was amused that FOX news sued Al Franken and tried to stop publication...It really does address the right wing steamroller hysteria that has swept our nation. I highly recommend it. This book is not only informative but will make you laugh. Amazon's 30% discount price is great, too!"
5,irreverently hilarious,"Whether you're a right wing EIB mugholder or you can't wait to vote for Hillary, Franken will make you LOL (laugh out loud.) For those of us with thousands of real time hours with Fox News, Bill O'reilly and Sean Hannity, we will never listen the same again after this read. And no one, whatever their social persuasion is, should feel the book isn't worth the price. Franken and his Harvard team have created a masterpiece of pithy humor."
4,Engaging Satire long overdue!,"This is a magnificent foray by a self-avowed liberal into the right-wing dominated world of political invective. Franken scores big hits debate-wise over his victims because he actually documents his assertions--unlike Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter who merely spill bile whether its in print or on television. The chapters on FOX Broadcasting are worth the price of the book alone. An aside: A reviewer with Ann Coulter's testosterone reviewed this book with the not-so-clever witticism that ""Lying liars"" is incoherent--if not an oxymoron. Not true, of course. A ""lying liar"" is as intelligible and easly understood as--say-- an ""honest truthteller."" Franken was merely being obnoxiously, creatively redundant with the title of his book. Morons and oxymorons as fair game for the book are another thing altogether."
5,Look at the reviews,"Notice in these reviews that a significant number of the one-star reviews are from people who either haven't read the book, or only read the first few pages? Folks, if you must review a book, at least read the book in it's entirety before you spew a negative review. If you do not, you are really no better than the lying liars that this book is written about. You also expose yourselves for the close-minded and often cold-hearted people that often are your typical conservatives."
1,While reading this borrowed book....,The song out of touch would be a supurb candidate for theme music...Hall and Oates from Big Bam BoomShake it up is all that we knowUsing the bodies up as we goWaking up to fantasyThe shates all around aren't the colors we used to seeBroken ice still melts in the sunAnd times that are broken can often be one againWe're soul aloneAnd soul really matters to meTake a look aroundYou're out of touchI'm out of timeBut i'm out of my head when you're not aroundReaching out for something to holdLooking for a love where the climate is coldManic moves and drowsy dreamsOr living in the middle between the two extremesSmoking guns hot to the touchWould cool down if we didn't use them so muchWe're soul aloneAnd soul really matters to meToo much
1,Not impressive.,"Franken tries to point out the lies made by the Right by showing some examples. The problem is that the ""lies"" aren't a big deal. So what if Bill O'Reilly lied (or made a mistake) about the name of an award he received many years ago? Is that going to destroy the country or something? I know that's not Franken's argument, but he makes it seem like the balance of America is at stake.Some of the ""lies"" that Franken points are either mistakes made or lies that are irrelevant in our lives anyway."
1,Rubbish....ok for bathroom reading....good fabricator!!!,"Don't waste your time. He proves himself to be the Liar, and the Liar that tells them. A totally typical left wing title...completely without class...Another left wing entertainer that shouldn't be taken seriously by mainstream Americans. (I don't care where he went to college, he needs therapy)...Definately has his own agenda. He is clever at twisting truths but I much prefer him on Saturday Night live as Stewart.....Sorry....not worth the read!!! On the other hand...Bill O'Reilly's books are right on the mark. I highly recommend ""The No Spin Factor"" and ""Fair and Balanced""....I can't wait to read the new book he has out. I'm sure Al Franken will write some garbage about that book. Can't wait for the title!!!...Please Al....be a guest on the ""Factor""...America would love it!!!"
1,Franken Has Gone Over the Edge,A.F. does not represent the left any better than O.J. represented African Americans. Don't waste your time reading his inane (or should I say insane) banter.
1,Please.....,"This book is by far the most idiotic book ever written. Franken is just a blind follower of the liberal faith who must see it as a personal mission to destroy, no wait annihilate, all things conservative. This was my first attempt at reading this obvious idealouge, and it will definitely be my last. His obvious smear campaign against people who at least have morals is a real turn off. People who like Franken say he usually walks the fine line between satire and ideology based statements. I disagree, he is way beyond the satire line and is only into conservative bashing. Don't waste your time on this moron, I am really sorry I did."
1,Zero Stars,"Zero stars are not an option.This book is worthy of no more than that. The title alone ""Lying Liars"" should give anyone who hopes to obtain anything they can trust some pause.It is well known Franken used some rather dubious methods and he himself committed a series of lies to gather quotes for this misereable piece of fluff.Save your money and buy a good fiction. This may be fiction but it is FAR from good. If you want a good laugh, try Seinfeld.He's a good comedian."
1,"Blah, blah, blah...","A man whose entire research team consists of only white men shouldn't criticize the GOP or ""big business"" of slighting affirmative action or being racist. This accusation and others like it in Franken's book are merely bits of uneducated and unaware heckling desperately attempting to pass as well-researched political commentary."
1,WOW!!!!,"That's all I can say. Wow. What a horrible book. I mean I know its Al Franken who authored it, but be serious .Who actually thinks any of this stuff is true? Liberals I have to hand it to you. You guys are living in a world that is completely unreal. Well guess what this lunatic is now in the US senate! Does that scare anyone? It should and not just conservatives. That should scare anyone who isn't joining the ""elite"" status as Franken. Just watch this guys voting record and watch your rights dissapear. Way to back up a nut job liberals. Good for you!!!"
1,Garbage from the LIBERAL (Socialist) left,"I took a look and read some of this book. I also so an interview that Franken did and I must say this book is garbage. It is nothing but a collection of liberal, humanistic, socialist, and Decratic party propaganda. I would like to caution people that if you buy this book remember this was written by one of the worst and least talented SNL comics. This man must be Michael Moores hero (another even worst liberal). As another reviewer says this is the liberal bible, so don't buy this lame excuse for a book and read instead the real Bible (it is the word of God). God Bless."
1,The best laugh of the year,"No, it wasn't the awful book. It was when my girlfriend told me that Al's wife's name is:Franni FrankenWhat a scream! I spit out my coffee when she said that."
4,To all of the One-Stars,"It never ceases to amaze me how the One-Star reviewers can dismiss something without any specific refereices to the content. Similar to the right-wing attack dogs Franken takes to task in this entertaining book, the One-Stars aren't interested in facts, just parroting that last thing they heard from Limbaugh, Coulter, Hannity, et al. Although some sections of the book are less successful than others, Franken scores big outing the current crop of right wing commentators for what they are...liars, with documentation to prove it. His chapter on the right's politicizing of Paul Wellstone's death is not to be missed.Thanks to Fox News for the free publicity. Unfortunately for them, their lawsuit, like everything on their network, is ""wholly without merit."" And if Franken is the liar that all of the One-Stars claim, then why was the lawsuit over copyright infringement rather than libel?"
5,Great piece of research,Among the sources that Al Franken and his team have interviewed are non other than Bill O'Reilly's own mother. His mother has contradicted O'Reilly's assertion that he grew up in a poor neighborhood and pulled himself up by his own bootstraps. His mother proudly tells Franken that her sons were raised in an upper middle class neighborhood and went to private schools and colleges. O'Reilly is a total liar! Fantastic book and expose of this right-wing blow hard.
5,"Funny, intelligent, and well written","To say the least, Franken's book is funny, intelleigent, & well written. I picked it up just a couple of days back, & couldn't stop reading until I finished the whole book.Although, I picked the book mainly due to the fact that it was going to be a political satire, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised to find that Franken makes valid points on how the right-wing media led by FOX News, has reduced the political discourse in this country into a propaganda debasement of Politicians.Gives a great insight into the workings of ringht-wing media bigwigs such as O'Reilley, Hannity, Coulter, etc.I highly recommend it."
4,Strident - perhaps - but good clean fun.,"I'm one of those folks who went out and bought the book IMMEDIATELY after hearing about the Fox Network lawsuit. I'm glad I did. Folks on the left will thoroughly enjoy it and those on the right will probably find plenty to attack. In many ways, Franken stoops to his opponents level, but he does so with plenty of facts to back him up.I thought the ""Chickenhawks"" segment was a little - OK a lot - off the track of his main argument..."
3,This section is for REVIEWS!!!!!!!,"To everyone - It gets wildly frustrating when you look to the review section to get the opinion of someone who has read a particular book only to find ""review"" after ""review"" posted by people who haven't read it!!! If you haven't READ THE BOOK - DO NOT POST A REVIEW!!! Is that hard to understand?! It's just as bad on some movie sites i've seen. The ""review"" says - ""I don't plan to see this movie. It looks stupid."" What is stupid is the ""reviewer"".!! Why would you even bother to post a review of a book you haven't read!! How dull is your life?!!! OK- i'm done venting now. Not that it will do any good."
1,Don't even bother...all lies...no fact whatsoever!,"Don't even waste your money on this trash. Franken and his ilk are what's ruining the United States with spinning lies and BS! Nothing but bull, bull and more bull!!! No real American patriot would even read, let alone buy into the rubbish Franken writes. He's a loser and his book stinks out loud! Be a real American and buy Bill O'Reilly's new book!"
1,Al Franken has tunnel vision,This book is not fact based but rather opinionated. I would not call that fair and balanced just utterly bias.
2,Needs a whole lot of fact checking...,"While the book is well written and quite witty at times, it should have been reviewed far more closely by his so called ""fact checkers"".Besides some clear errors stated by other reviewers, the fact that Franken cites Internet blogs as sources to back some of his outrageous claims is not only comical, but grounds for the book to be relegated to the fiction section of any respectable book store."
2,Just like Limbaugh,"Franken's book, like his previous tome, the tastefully titled ""Rush Limbaugh Is A Big, Fat Idiot,"" may be amusing, but like the rants of the pompous, hypocritical windbag he so loathes, contributes nothing meaningful to political dialogue. Like Limbaugh, he's part of the problem. Satire is a useful tool, but Franken doesn't use it well. He's as one-sided as his opponents on the right.Of course, it's rather pointless to bother writing any truthful comments about a book such as this. Who the hell shows up at this page except Franken's fans? They probably own the book already, but come here to give a poor rating to any review that suggests Franken is anything less than a genius. Why even let anyone vote on reviews when the votes, like most of the reviews, are biased?"
1,Stop the hogwash!!,"When will some people on the left begin to think for themselves instead of repeating uncritically what their ""leaders"" say? They are only angry because they are no longer in power and are becoming more shrill and desperate. You certainly have the right to vent your spleen, but don't try to dress it up like fact."
1,Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced,"This book was the biggest waste of paper I have ever encountered. Al Franken is neither smart nor funny, he's just annoying. What a waste."
5,"Excellent, amusing, and a little scary","Using just the right mix of humor and actual facts, Al Franken points of some of the lies that are told in the name of ""right."" For example: Remember the reports of vandalism by Clinton staffers reported by the newly elected Bush White House team? Guess what: It NEVER happened. This is just one of the many coverups and outright lies Franken and his brilliant team of college students uncovered in writing this book.If you don't believe everything you are told by the President and his team, you should definitely read this book."
1,This Democrat says: Al Franken is no Paul Wellstone,"Frankly, I find Al Franken to be an embarrassment. He is a petulant little man who resorts to name calling and libel. He pretends to be your friend (e.g., his vulgar use of Paul Wellstone's death for his own political purposes) to advance his own career. Well yes Mr. Franken, you did it. You made your millions by trashing reputations and sullying the political discourse. But no matter how you slice it, you'll never score with a beautiful chick. Sucks, doesn't it?"
1,Discrace....Not Satire,"Al Franken is a discrace to America and this book documents that fact. Hiding behind the words like ""satire"", Mr. Frankin attacks just about everything good in this country. Politics used to be civil in this great country where people could debate issues and find common ground. Jerks like Frankin that have no ideas to share, only the words of hate and disrespect. They are given a stage by the liberal media to distroy the very institution that gives them the right to speak. I hated Clinton and every thing he stood for. But, I never showed disrespect for the office of the President. The good news is that right minded Americans will see through this act and regect his vile message. Come to think of it, I hope you sell more copies of his book. The sooner he is exposed, the better!"
1,Waste of paper.,"Waste of paper. I don't know how people can read books like this. After reading the first page at the book store, I moved on."
5,Critical as well as funny...,"This book does a great job of dissecting how tabloid celebrities like Bill O'Reilly (hypocrite), Sean Hannity (nazi) and Ann Coulter (oh my god, please call an exorcist!) systematically manipulate people in order to sell their books/shows/agenda and sensationalize non-issues (often to discredit their opponents and the ""political left""). It is easy to dismiss books like this because they are ""written by comedians"" or ""focus on criticisms rather than solutions"", but I found that Mr. Franken did an excellent job of presenting the real facts while exposing the hypocrisy behind the right-wing media. The humor in the book is absolutely relevant to the discussion because some of the lies are so insanely obvious that you have to laugh at how easily they are being told by the right-wing media! Plus the humor makes the usual dry political issues easier to understand and read. Buy the book, pass it around, and laugh out loud (and boycott Fox!)..."
1,Lies and Lying Liars Who Write Them.,"Blatant lies and revisionism at its finest. Mr. Franken puts together a mildly humorous book that is filled with factual errors, venomous hate, and the largest distortion of the truth that I have seen since Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi credited Bill Clinton as ""creating"" the military that was so successful in Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. Don't waste your money on this book, if you hate America and Americans as much as Mr. Franken does just send your money directly to Al-Qaeda to support their operations against us."
1,It's just so...laughable,I think the highly original and witty title of this book pretty much says it all.
1,Liberal Vomit,I am appaled that this is the first book that comes up for me as recommended from Amazon along with you other Republican hater titles. Grow up and become a true American.
1,"""liars,"" huh?","Al, thank God, the sixties are OVER. Haven't you gotten hip to the fact that the tide is turning, and, hopefully, you liberals will soon follow the fate of the Berlin Wall, James Dean, and/or the Kennedys? And re the ""title"" of your ""book,"" I reckon it takes one to know one, huh?"
1,"Bad Frinken, Bad Bad","Dear Mister Frinklin, why oh why due you make funn of my faverat tv show. Fox nitwork is my heroe. They putt all you white trash leberals to sham. As the avarege fox netwerk viewor who vetod fer Goerge Busch I am palled at yur frickin badd mouthin ways! Hannratty is my heroe. He makes lots of funny noizes with his muth and shouts at lots of peple and so is Bill thogh I dont git him sometimes. He's reallllllllll smart. They don lie neither. I wood vote for prezident Busch agin and agin and agin cause you leberals don't truss no one, not even the prezident. Howl can you live wif yrselves when you don't trust noone?? HUH? You are all pathetogenic!"
1,*yawn*,"I'm not sure about everybody else, (...) It's no surprise to me that nearly every bleeding-heart liberal who enjoys books like these I know are trendy mindless followers desperately attempting to be hip, they certainly don't do it because of logic, the kind which had no place in this book. I'm sure that everybody who doesn't know any better or is getting mad because they are in denial (AKA the kind of people who buy books like these) is going to say that this review *gasp* was not helpful! (They sure showed me) If you have the time to sit around and get angry because you don't know what you're talking about so you let the liberal media tell you what to think, then go do something constructive. (oh wait, does Micheal Moore have to tell you what that is first?)"
1,"Unbalanced in all ways, great for far left wing","Starting with the title, this book is anything but ""fair and balanced."" So the ""lies and lying liars who tell them"" portion of the title is very appropo since it is a perfect description of the author. I would recommend this book to only the most left-wing liberals among us, for they are the only ones who can truly enjoy this book."
1,Simple Review,This book is simply revisionist history. Even though he claims to have used LEXIS NEXIS searches to support his partisan conclusions recreating the same searches undercut his claims. Either his 15 Harvard research assistants only brought him the articles they thought he would have liked or he lost every computer printout that didn't fit into his pre-packaged boiler plate satire. It is a shame most people don't have the funds or the inclination to subscribe to LEXIS NEXIS in order add the information Mr. Franken didn't think fit into his tired routine that he attempts to pass off as witty comedy.
1,Splotchy Al on C-SPAN,"Bill O'Reilly should get some vidcaps of Al Franken on C-SPAN. That dude looks horrible, and yes, he has angry red splotches all over his face (hard to see behind the Coke-bottle glasses). I can't imagine his wife Fanny wanting to make eye contact (tough to do when your husband is cross-eyed).By the way, this is satire people! Ha ha ha. Coulter is a nutcase! Ha ha ha. Franken is splotchy! Ha ha ha. Think Al Franken will get it? The irony is sweet indeed."
1,Al Franken is a moron,Yet another stupid book filled with leftist ideas and propaganda. Get a fresh perspective already! Franken's ideas and viewpoints are nothing but the same stuff he's been whining about for years.
4,For those who want to know the truth,"This book gives a fun look at the lies spread by politicians, the media, and political analysts. It should be read by anyone on the fence about the upcoming election. Way to go, Al."
3,Come on people,"You guys are idiots. Perhaps you should be reading Cat in the Hat instead of political literature. You honestly believe that only the Right side is guilty of Franken's accusations. Look long enough and you will find ""proof"" stating the facts (in print) skewed both ways. I don't see this as ""Fair and Balanced"" at all.It hasn't been that long since Clinton left office. How could anyone have forgotten his antics in tenure so quickly?The book was supposed to entice the reader to question facts. Facts presented by either party should be scrutinized.What a bunch of sheep."
1,A trip to Neverland,"Unbelievably wrong on nearly every point. A childish venting with no facts, proof, or reason. An attempt to spur urban legends."
1,I gave it one star because the spelling was correct.,"That's about where it ended. I found the book to be mean spirited and filled with half truths. This book and the author are a prime example of why we are where we are in our country today.We need to start pulling together as a nation and give up the name-calling, partisan fighting.I found this book to be sophmoric and uninformed. Buy at your peril."
1,"Oh, what a tangled web we weave.....","There is very little to recommend this book. Being factually challengened and intellectually free, this is nothing more than the same old regurgitated material which is repeated (in one form or another) by liberal after liberal after liberal in the hope that some poor slob might actually buy into it.Liberals, you are in deep trouble if this is the best and brightest that you have to offer.Read this book in the restroom....you never know when you might run short of Charmin."
1,The liar that tells the lies,"I find it laughable that you idiots find this guy to be funny. Here's a second rate comedian that had one of the biggest box office flops in history, now working for a radio station funded by the propaganda machine that can't even pay their bills! That is funny! They cannot compete against the people he denounces, so he has to lie and make up stories and preach to his choir! I would love to see him debate Ann Coulter. She would rip him to shreds."
1,THE WORST,"Mr. Franken has done it again. In his endless goal to try and make money he has pandered to the lowest form of humanity, hate. Mr. Franken Hates conservatives and republicans, he hates free speech(fox news). And he basically hates everything america is all about, he hates open debate, he hates people with differnt political views then him and he hates religioins like christianity. This is a hateful intolerant book.Mr. Franken should not be purchased, it only feeds his ego and feeds his hatred towards america. A terrible book that condemns fox news simply because he doesnt agree that society should be given all points of view."
5,"Man, is it good","I've been a liberal for a long time. I love it. It just makes sense. This book is great at pointing out all that is wrong with conservatism. Every time I turned the page, I knew I was in for a chuckle or even prolonged laughter on the humorous yet scary truths that were uncovered about our favorite neighbors to the right. And you know what? All the bad reviews on here point out that Franken stoops to name calling and 6th grade debate quality...yet that is what the review itself is doing. The right is very hipocritical when they attempt to shoot down their opponents. It's sad to realize that the only thing that keeps the right going is the love of the almighty dollar. Nobody cares if the world goes to hell, as long as they can have their money...which is what is happening today. But this goes into my rant about how the Bush administration is the death of America, and that is discussed in this book a lot better than I could ever discuss it."
5,Outstanding Book!,"Usually the material covered in this book makes me depressed -- only Al Franken could present it in a way that makes laugh uncontrollably.I have to admit -- I primarily purchased this book out of spite of Fox. But it only took about five pages to totally get hooked.Finally, FINALLY we have someone to stand up to these right-wing bullies. Go Al!!!Michael"
1,baaad,"what a bad book, filled with his own lies, petty thougts, and full of misled hatred.Don't waste your time. Find a SNL repeat on the Comedy channel, because that is what he is: a comedian."
5,THE PERSON WHO SAID IF YOU WRITE BAD THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE...,"then your mom dies...I'd just like to say, ""Mr. O'Reilly, don't you have better things to do then waste your time writing reviews on Amazon?"" Perhaps, he has another trashy novel to write. Anyone who would say this is a heartless idiot who needs to be strapped on a shuttle going straight to the sun. Anyways, this book was awesome. I read it months ago and I loved it. I really just wanted to write this review since I read in ""Mother Jones"" that someone wrote a review saying that Mr. Franken's mother died b/c he wrote this book! Utterly disgusting....Its almost as bad as lying about a war and sending young men and women to die for some worthless imperialist fight...."
4,A relief....,"More disturbing than anything in this book are the comments left by reviewers! You can see how the president's policy of ""being a uniter and not a divider"" is working and its nice to see the thoughtful and tolerant atmosphere he has created!I've concluded the reason Franken's liberal communist pinko tripe consitently finds its way to the best seller list is, he has so little competition. Everywhere you look you see conservatives and ultra-conservatives. But the only other liberal is that Michael Moore guy--the one who gave the speech saying the president's weapons of mass destruction argument was ""ficticious""."
5,He DID say Norm Thomas was Evan Thomas Jr's grandfather!!!,"It's in the endnotes people - page 379. Look the damn thing up before you accuse someone of lying or twisting the truth, the very point that Franken is trying to get across with this book.All of you who say he purposefully mis-led readers when he said Ann Coulter lied about Norm Thomas being Evan Thomas Jr's father are proving Franken's argument against Coulter for her use of endnotes instead of footnotes. That is, Coulter uses hundreds of endnotes in her book ""Treason,"" but not a single footnote. She does this because she knows that by burying all her questionable sources and clarifications in the very back of the book, most people will never check them, and thus they'll be taking her word for it instead of calling her on all the bogus crap she's been putting out. Check out www.alfrankenweb.com if you want more of the real, verifiable TRUTH."
5,Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"This is an a amazing book. Witty, funny and intelligent. Must reading for all voters. You will not be easily fooled by the media, talk show hosts and pundits, and Bush administration."
3,Politicians lie... what a revelation.,"""Lies"" is a moderately entertaining book from a over-achieving Al Franken. If the book is taken at base level - a political commentary written by a comedy writer - it can be a fun read. But when Franken at times begins to suppose he is an expert in politics, his naivete undermines his ability to make his arguments.Regarding his arguments... he makes no more impressive arguments regarding the ""political enemy"" then do opposite numbers Coulter & Co.""Lies"" is good for a few good laughs and enjoyable anecdotes. But if you look deeper, you'll come up a little empty. And you'll realize what a scary situation it is that a large majority of the voting public get their political ideologies from comedy writers and disc jockeys."
1,Boring book of half truths...,"His first book was funny and I hoped that this would follow suit. Franken is obsessed with giving the extreme left a voice to equal Limbaugh and Fox News for the right. What comes out is shrill and tired old liberal adages for conservative views. It's ironic that the title of the book leads you to believe that the conservatives only tell you half the story, the whole time Franken only tells you half the story. Present the other side next time Al....maybe you'll accomplish something.Get it at the library...it's worth a few laughs"
3,Ok we get the point already,I like the title of this book. I liked the first few pages of this book. I agree with the bulk of what the author is saying. Don't really like his style of writing. The problem is after ten pages we get it! The people he talks about are right wing bigots who lie. Got it! Agreed! Now what else do you have to say. This book would make a great Vanity Fair article but not a whole book.
1,Oh my............,I wanted to give my husband (a fiscal conservative) a gift so that he would see both sides of the arguement...BAD IDEA! I read it and it was horrible. I gave it to him anyway and he opened it and TRASHED it. Oh my.....
2,"""Come on, Al""","While I did find this book to be somewhat entertaining and nowhere near as bad as O'Reilly and others claim it to be, I must say it is beyond a satire. Throwing around the term liar the way Franken does is not satyrical, it is smear. If this is the best the Left has to offer, I am glad I am on the Right."
1,Limousine liberal,"How can anyone take Al Franken seriously? It's not his politics that I disagree with but his attitude. He's mean, petty, and lacks the compassion that liberals claim to possess but, sadly, almost never do. It's because of this mean-spiritedness that I find so typical in those who profess to care about the common man that I am reluctant to identify myself as a liberal, even though that's where I stand politically. Besides, Franken is a limousine liberal, a hypocrite who makes money from the very system he professes to find so unfair."
3,Book Left Out Biggest All Time Liar,"Franken is funny, but this book crosses into political bashing. I like good comedy like Franken, Carlin, Hendrie but if you are going to write a book about liars, what about Bill Clinton? Franken picks on Coulter, Limbaugh, Bush and many conservatives. The cover of this book should have Bill Clinton, not Al Franken. The media lies, more of my opinion can be found at remotecontrolwars.com, but this book is too slanted, not all encompassing. The biggest liars of the past were Martha Stewart, Bill and Hillary, and a host of liberals, left out of this book."
1,How does the idiot operate a typewriter?,"Another hateful book about the conservative right. Franken offers nothing intellectually, but the liberals will flock to it like a goverment handout. How pathetic. Folks, don't waste yout time on this book, instead find a useful, non-union job and stop wasting precious resources."
5,Alternately funny and infuriating,"I picked up this book after seeing 'Fahrenheit 911', since I'd thought that was loose with the facts and heard from a number of folks that Al Franken does a better job at shining a light on hypocrites in the government and media--funnier and more objective in his approach.After reading this, I couldn't agree more. He is objective with the facts (something F911 lacked), and savagely funny with his analysis of those facts. I ended up liking this well enough to purchase a few copies for my family members who don't understand why I'm voting for the Democrat in the coming election.There is one chapter that I considered weak--a fictitious scenario in which all the folks who avoided military service(Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld) join Kerry's unit and goof up. It was so overtly biased and 'on the nose', it wasn't really funny. The rest of the book, though, was aces."
5,"Ignore the politics, embrace the humor","This book is too brilliant to be ignored for political disagreements. Sure it's 99% politically-driven, but that extra 1% of pure unbrideled hilarity pushes its weight. I read alot of comedy books. Alot. And never have I read anything so funny. I would endlessly suggest this to anyone that can read and has some sort of knowledge of the basics of politics. Most comedy books have the ultimately inescapeable ""filler curse"" where the first half is undying hilarity, while the second half bores you to tears leaving a bad aftertaste. This book breaks the mold with nonstop laughs from cover to cover.If you disagree with the politics, try to give it a shot for the pure comedy. You will laugh. There's a reason Al worked for SNL for so many years: Al Franken is a comedic genius."
5,Excellent and well written book.,"I have been an Al Franken fan since his brillian work on Saturday Night Live. This book, as well as Michael Moore's wonderful and accruate ""Stupid White Men"" is the cold hard reality of how America is the ""Titanic"", and there are not enough lifeboats. Us Liberals need to stick together and get the ""Liars"" out of the White House before all of us non white, hetero-men are nothing but dust. Thank you Mr. Franken, for being the voice for the voiceless."
1,He found the secret,"Wow!! Al has really found the secret to make something out of nothing. All we need to do is to pick a forum, make up a bunch of lies, and hype it in print. Anyone can say anything about anything and make big bucks. I can not wait until the next installment of Big Al's rants is published. Get a life and find a new career!!!"
1,Incredible irony,Al Franken focuses on his favorite target; the right wing and the lies he claims they push. The irony is that Franken focuses little to none on the truth himself but instead uses this book as yet another launching pad for his one-sided views. I'm sorry I wasted the time going thru the book. Reading the first few pages is sufficient to get his point. The rest of the book is wasted paper... I would strongly suggest that you spend your money on a book that is 'fair and balanced'...
1,I'D LIKE TO SEE FRANKLIN FIGHT AGAINST HANNITY,Al franklin (liberal idiot liar) should try to beat up Sean Hannity (TRUE AMERICAN) beacuse Franklin would get his stupid buck teeth smashed into his face!!! Franklin says PRESIDEENT BUSH (HERO) isnt' a real American. GUESS WHAT AL STUPID?? HE is the president and his killing all your terrorist friends and the liberals liars are going nuts. The liberals should be put in a jail with SADDAM since they love him and BIN LADEN. I HATE ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO KILL AMERICANS. AL FRANKLIN BOOKS IS FOR COMPLETE STUPID IDIOTS.
1,"If you aren't already a big fan of Al Franken, steer clear","Another lame attempt by Franken to proclaim himself smarter than the rest of the civilized world. For once I would love to see one of these geniuses do something worthwhile, you know, like run for office and make a difference. It is soooo easy to say what should be done, but no one ever does it."
5,Both hysterical and sad,"I found the book to be a very funny account and could have laughed harder if not for the sad state of affairs it reveals about our nation. Thanks to the author for setting the record straight and for caring about the truth. Americans are, unfortunately, being duped by many of today's political authors, but Franken is not one of them. And not only is he not one of them, he is also excellent at revealing how the others get away with it - to which I must say, ""Shame on you Ann Coulter!"" He gets his point across with a delightful presentation of the facts and humor - what a novel idea!"
1,"Should be Re-titled ""an unfair/unblanced look at the right""","Franken focuses on extreme examples that do not represent the conservative right in America. I consider myself middle of the road politically - i tend not to support the far left or far right; but Franken's book is nothing more than Jesse Jackson like far left propoganda. I was hoping this book would truly be what it reprsented: "" a fair and balanced look at the right"" - it's not, it's simply an all out attack on the right with poor, extreme examples."
1,Uh huh........,"""From reading the various negative reviews from like-minded, conservative, patriots, I have determined that Mr. Franken is no good. As the conservatives have pointed out, he is the one lying. I understand that it is not worth their time to actually point out his lies, but I believe them since they love America and Mr. Franken does not. So if I had a copy of this book, I would burn it. Thank you fellow conservatives for your thoughtful reviews.""Grow up, Democrat."
1,Moronic,"Insipid, petty, and plain mean, Al Franken shows why he was the kid who always got beat up in school.He was funny once. Now he's become a pathetic caricature of a ""serious"" liberal author, grasping at the fame he used to know.Save your money, or spend it on a book worthy of your time."
1,opps caught Mr franken in a lie!!!!!!!!,"In reading Mr. franken's book I see where he stakes the credibility of the book on telling the truth. well, well, well, Mr. franken insists that President Bill Clinton NEVER received offered from the Sudanese Government to turn over Osama Bin Ladin to the USA. Well, unfortunately for Mr. Franken former President Bill Clinton has admitted that this is the absolute truth and that he regretted this over any thing else that happened in his administration. It appears he asked Janet Reno if we should accept the offer's from the Sudan and Reno's opinion was that we did not have the evidence to try him yet. So Clinton said NO to the 3 offers from the Sudan. On the last offer he told to Sudan to let Osama go on to Afghanistan well, Mr. frankin maybe I should write a book about you lying, you got some explaining to do."
1,A waste of good trees,"Al Franken, himself an admitted liar, has stooped to a new low. Apparently Mr. Franken fancies himself as some sort of Ann Coulter wannabe, only representing the liberal slant. Politics aside, Franken falls far short of Ms. Coulter's works. The writing is pathetic, the so-called facts are loose at best, and the self-promotion is sickening. Rather than promote the agenda of the left, Franken manages to twist the message into nothing but a hate fest of the right. A disgusting piece of drivel. I highly suggest anyone considering purchasing this ""book"" rethink that decision. A total waste of good trees."
1,Great job Amazon! Now take it further!,"Bravo Al and Bravo Amazon. It is high time we rid the world of those we disagree with. I am proud that Amazon has shown their true colors by indicating their support for the elimination of America's number one enemy, conservatives. With the help of the likes of Al and Amazon, we can totally eliminate them all! Then we won't have to listen to them and that pesky free speech stuff! </sarcasm>Hey Amazon, take this a step further! Why not release the names and addresses of any customer you may have left after this stunt who would dare to even browse books by non-liberals to the likes of Brown-Shirt Al so he can send goons to their homes to reeducate them! That is the only way his type can win."
5,"Sharp, witty, right on target",It's about time someone really nails the right-wing blowhards on Fox and cable and exposes them for the frauds they are. It's pretty funny that most conservatives who read this or just see the title don't even understand irony or satire.
1,Could have been funnier,"I expected more from such a good comedian. He has been so funny in the past, but I believe his book is lacking."
1,What a joke!,"Every time I look at his picture on the cover, I can't help but chuckle. I can't take this guy seriously. He has so much hate for conservatives that you know he is totally biased and twists the facts as he wishes. I would love to see Bill O'Reilley interview this spin-doctor.The first thing I read in the book was about some fairy tale that Bill Clinton made a plan to destroy Al Queda a few weeks before leaving office, but George Bush ""screwed it up"" because he didn't follow through! Like I'm supposed to believe that! hahaha. Even if let's say it's true, Clinton had 8 years to get rid of Al Queda, yet he waits until a few years before leaving office!? What a joke!"
1,WEAK,"So I see ""liberals"" are consulting failed comedians for their political dogma and regurgitated non-ideas about how the world works. I think Im going to follow suit and read up on Daffy Ducks works on chemical engineering!Get a life SUCKERSPS- great job with that Dean campaign, Franken. Guess his appeal only applied to borderline sociopaths like yourself!!!"
1,Lies........Yes Al you do !!,Al sure knows how to pile the crap deep & wide. I'd like to see him back up his claims with REAL facts. Just another spin-meister that is grabbing the money and making a run.Save you money and your time.....bathroom walls make better reading!
1,There was no .1 stars option,"As one would expect, Al Franken's new book is ""bad enough, it's dumb enough, and gosh darnit, nobody likes it!"" Franken again regurgitates a string of tired-out, false interpretations of loose facts that he overheard around the Closet Homosexuals of America mineral-water cooler. Franken's argument lacks insight, due diligence, anything resembling research, and lots of material that would be funny to anyone who was born and raised in solitary confinement. Liberals, this is the book for you. Just senseless enough to make you instantly buy it and canonize it. Enjoy, you muttonheaded socialists."
1,Bad Comedian-Bad Analysis,"I am just so worn out from the new liberal Facism. Huey Long said it correctly when he predicted that the new facists will come from the left and they will call themselves anti-facists. At least when James Carville gets up and rants we know that he is a paid stooge. I read this and a Molly Ivins book on a ""dare' from an ""enlightened"" friend who thought I either wouldn't or couldn't. All I can say is at least Molly usually gets her facts right and I get my disagreements from her politics. This lame and incredibly vain man gets his jollies by selective use of the public record, calling that fact and providing playground name calling...Rush Limbaugh at least sells radio advertising...Please waste your time and money if you want to get involved in the current mudslinging...Otherwise, buy subscriptions to the National Review and the New Republic and fight the fight in you own mind...DB"
1,Big Disappointment,I got this book as a gift from a client who thought I would like it based on my proclivity for satire. I am glad that I did not buy it. I am sorry that my client wasted her money.
1,Another fictional account by Mr. Franken,"Unlike Amazon's reviewer's assessment that Mr. Franken ""dissects factual inaccuracies"", Mr. Franken seems to be on a planet of his own, making up his own fantasyland as he goes."
1,Al Franken sucks !,"As usual, anything Al Franken has acted, spoke, or written has been boring liberal whining trash. This book contains nothing but the same rhetoric. My rating is a big YAWN!"
1,A waste of a good afternoon....,"I feel sorry for the poor little trees, that were mercilessly chopped down to print this garbage. Hopefully these books were printed out of recycled materials.So Bill O'Reilly marked a little box ""republican"" a few years ago, says he doesn't remember doing so. If only we all told such ""horrific"" earth shattering lies, end sarcasm . This lie was the basis for an entire chapter?I'm wondering why republican err democratic presidential candidate Wes Clark didn't get a mention in this chapter as well Mr. Franken. Isn't everyone fair game when it comes to character assasination ? Oh that's right Mr. Clark says his views have changed, and lucky for him they've changed to match Franken's."
1,What an idiot this Franken is,"I would be more than happy to write a book entitled ""BIGGER lies and they BIGGER lying liars who tell them: A fair and Balanced look at the Left"" oh, but uh Democrats don't lie. . . .YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This book is trash, and I have no respect for the idiot Al Franken, nor any other actor who decides he thinks he knows what best for the American people. Al, SHUT UP! You've had a dream life that very few americans enjoy: pretending to be someone else and getting paid millions to do it. Shut up and do you meaningless job: pretend. You're liberal B.S. is complete garbage and you're a coward."
1,Lying Liars?,"Aren't ""lying liars"" really telling the truth? Even Franken's title doesn't make sense, never mind the book! How come this wasn't caught by one of the 14 ""brilliant"" Havard graduates that helped ""research"" this book? After all, as one positive reviewer glowed, ""despite their politics, at least you have to admit they've got to be pretty smart to be there"". Of course, George Bush attended Yale, but alas, as justified by the liberal mindset, he is still ""dumb""."
3,Mean-spirited but entertaining,"Let's face it, liberal comedians of the SNL stripe have built careers out of taking broad swipes at the right, basically mocking their duplicity and sanctimonious nature. Franken has been somewhat more successful, probably due to his better writing skills and penchant for research, but he is simply extending his comedic routines to highlight some very disturbing facts about the conservative media machine and the Bush administration. This book isn't serious political discourse, but it is entertaining and enlightening. Fox News and their Neo-Con ilk are basically SNL for conservatives, but the problem I have is that Fox News, Coulter, and Hannity et al hide behind the shield of ""journalism"" to disseminate fabrications designed to forward a specific political agenda. Franken and his kind don't really pretend to be impartial journalists - they're comedians making fun of politicians."
3,Balance in the Media = Good for Democracy,"I bought this book for one simple reason, the one stated above. I felt it would be important to support some sort of ""obviously liberal"" media forms, in this case Al Franken's book. I was expecting a serious political book, however, instead I got a kind of ""mish mash"" liberal comedy routine. Which isn't a bad thing! Like I said, it is important to have balance in the media. However, in reading this book a lot of the chapters kind of boil down to mere opinion sometimes. Franken also has a slight habit of stooping to low language and distortions. There's also the fact that he kind of rambles from topic to topic without sharp focus.However, he is a funny guy at times. This is worth picking up if you are a fan of, say, Michael Moore type ""liberal"" media. Viva democracy and the right to free speech!"
5,"Entertaining, yet (gasp) TRUTHFUL political read!","You have to love Al and ""Team Franken"" for their blunt honesty...which is a refreshing diversion from the crap we are fed daily by the media. Although I knew there was a reason why Bill O'Reilly, hell, the entire Fox News Channel, rubbed me the wrong way, I could never quite put my finger on it...thank you Al for putting it in writing for me. A must-read before you vote--no matter which way you lean. Even George W. in all his religious zeal would agree that the Good Book (the Bible for those of you that might not know) teaches us to tell the truth. Shame on you Bill O'Reilly!"
1,This book is only good for fireplace kindling,"I stopped reading this lie-fest (lies told BY Franken and his ""team"") in the ""Bush can't lose with Clinton's military"" chapter, where Franken and his ""team"" lost all credibility with me when they called Reagan a ""draft dodger who hated the military."" Reagan was not a draft dodger, he was a Second Lieutenant in the Officer's Reserve Corps who was declared ineligible to serve overseas due to near-sightedness. And hated the military? I'm actually surprised that Franken would be dumb enough to put THAT in his book. The person who dodged the draft, who used trickery and deception to avoid the draft, was none other than William Jefferson Clinton."
5,Funny and well researched,This is a fantastic read. Al Franken and his team of 20 college interns spend months researching the claims made by right wing blow hards such as Bill O'Reily and Anne Coulter. He proves their arguments wrong in a very funny way. If you like reading political books than this is probably the best one on the market.
4,Good For Al,"I haven't finished the book, but I am enjoying every page thus far. It is a breath of fresh air to finally read something that I have been craving for over two years. The truth! While Al's satire sometimes gets tiresome, the content of his book is excellent and humorous. It doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator, which most people who enjoy reading, both conservative and liberal, are not.As an aside, the fox tag line 'We Report You Decide' turns out to be a lie. No mention of the dropped lawsuit on their web page."
3,The Real Spotted Bill,"I don't know where the author got his facts from, but this stuff sure was funny, hilarious and down right interesting. Bill O'reilly, Ann Coulter and all others were made to look like amateurs in an arena they clearly should not be in. And though the author did explore some serious and disturbing environmental issues, his comedic diatribes usings republicans and others as whipping boys was the main subject. Very funny stuff..."
5,Read with care. Laugh out loud alert!,"First of all: You HAVE TO VERIFY ALL YOUR FACTS!!! Al Franken advises his readers not to take him at his word, and you should take this under advisement.This book addresses the statements by various conservatives that have most angered him, and his least favorite personalities, and their utterances. A lot of Al Franken's arguments are well made, but you have to be a careful reader. The statements he attacks are of various degrees of objectionability, ranging from spin, to outright falsehood. To a true believer, what a conservative says will sound perfectly valid, while everyone else will hear a clear distortion of the facts. On the whole, Al Franken is convincing.Best of all, of course, is that Al Franken is one of the funniest people alive today. The fact that I agree with his politics by and large, is a great plus.Arch"
4,"Well researched, viciously attacked.","I decided to read this book after I heard so many consertive pundits bash it. I noticed their ""refutation"" of it consisted primarily of personal attacks on Mr. Franken. After reading the book, it seems this is their standard M.O. I was delighted by his spirited defense of Al Gore (A.K.A Compulsive Liar VP.) Why didn't someone in the media do that during the election? The last 8 years might have been different."
4,Comments mirror global polarization,Al Franken has written a well researched and funny book about the dumbing down of America and the degree to which political zealots can hijack a country for their own misguided agendas. The reader reviews reflect the degree to which the Bush Administration and conservative media has polarized the political debate. Americans would do well to travel and see how other people around the world feel about their governments actions. Unfortunately far too large a number could care less what the rest of the world thinks. I am somewhat taken aback by those readers who rate the book one star and back their ratings up with childish name calling and libelous attacks. I suspect these people have not even read the book or if they have read it the did so with their opinion already formed. We are in the middle of a dark chapter of American politics and I can only pray that the American public will come to their senses and send the Bush administration packing this fall.
5,I couldn't put it down!,"Great book! I consider myself politicaly neutral, so I really enjoyed the comedy of this book. I also found Al and ""Team Franken"" to be extremely diligent in reasearching the TRUTH!I recommend this book to everyone. I'd rather have the truth with some comedy than the ""Spin"" from the Bullying ""Bill O'Lilley"" as Al calls him.Read the book! Have some fun! Don't listen to the negitive reviews that want to keep the TRUTH from you. Read it yourself and draw your own conclusions.If you don't like Bush you will have some good laughs too.Read it. Laugh.And Al if you read this, Great Work! Keep it comming!"
2,Just stick to comedy gags Al.,"In my honest opinion, Al Franken reached his intellectual zenith as the stoned, bumbling baggage handler in Trading Places. It's been a steep descent since, and this latest book of his only makes this fact more obvious and sad. A few paragraphs were mildly humorous, but nothing that'll cause spontaneous coffee discharge from your favorite orifice. If you want humor, pass this one over and read Dave Barry. If you want incessant, hate-charged ranting from a kooky leftist who still believes the 21st century began on 1/1/2000, then this is your book.He's NOT good enough...he's NOT smart enough, and DOGGONIT, people are starting to DISLIKE him."
1,stuff,"I am not surprised. There are a number of typical problems with this tome. First, Franken does not provide an indepth and insightful review of the issues. Franken does not offer any keen solutions. Rather, he writes a polemic that reads more like a raving mad speech from Hitler than a scientific, philosphical or political review. Second, Franken relies on insult and name calling when referring to his political opponents. The reader clearly can tell he not only disagrees with his political opponents but he also hates them, and this enrages his soul. Finally, because the vast majority of his general topics are stated in platitudinal form and the vast majority of his particular comments ring of demogoguery rather than logical argument, Franken fails to present a persuasive argument.In conclusion, this book fails to make any substantial or even trivial contribution to the liberal cause and for that reason I strongly recommend avoiding it."
3,This book is perfectly average.,"al franken isnt exactly a simpering slave to the liberal machine but he aint biased either know what i mean? i mean, he even wrote a book about how hed like to be president. its clear that he wants to discredit every candidate including bush to advance his own causes. i bet if kerry wins he writes a book about kerry and about how he stinks as a president.its still funny tho lol."
3,Drivel...Pure Drivel,"For entertainment value, this book is a fair read. There are issues which ultra right and left wingers are both on shaky ground in their arguments. For proving a point or making an argument, which I believe he is attempting to do through his bitter satire, Mr. Franken fails to succeed. If he wants to be taken seriously, he should write seriously. Until then, I will continue to put him in the category of liberal hot-head under the guise of satire. If you like, read this book for what it is: Entertainment."
2,Franken's Folly,It only gets 2 stars for a couple of good one-liners. Everyone likes a good joke. The problem is there are only a couple of good one-liners. The rest of the time you will spend laughing at this book not along with it.Al Franken leans so far to the left he can't tie his right shoe. Any validity to his points is overwhelmed by his obvious bias.
5,Read the book and the reviews - then decide,"I found the book very entertaining and well written / researched, though perhaps a bit puerile in some of the humor. It made me fear for the course on which our country seems to be headed. Even more frightening, is the tone / vitriol of most of the negative reviews I've read. It only reinforces the message of the book. Perhaps the most frightening review is the one from the reader in Texas who doesn't care that his ""messengers"": Coulter, O'Reilly, et al, are lying, as long as the ""core message"" gets through. HELLO!?! What does it say about the ""core message"" if it relies on lies!?! ""By their fruits shall you know them"" seems to say it all!"
5,"OK, Conservies I've read your reviews ...","...and I haven't seen any refutations on your part just attacks and comments on Al's career. I don't just consume these books I also do my own research. I am about 1/2 way through the book and Al(or should I say TeamFranken) is batting 1000. Let's see some of you conseratives attack the facts. You won't because you can't. Check them. I dare you!The book sparkles with intelligence and wit. Now don't take Al at his word. I think this is what he is really talking about. Check the ""facts"". That's what an informed citizen does. Don't be spoon fed. Let this book be a springboard.Cheers"
2,Good comic relief,"Mr. Franken is foremost a comedian, and his credentials are more closely aligned with comedy than fiction, although this is moderately well written.His arguments are very baseless, and I actually had to fight off putting the book down for good.The real target market for this book, in my opinion, is any left-wing reader who wants a little reinforcement for his views, and K-3rd graders.I enjoyed Mr. Franken on Saturday Night Live; he ""left"" me with this tome."
1,why?,why would anyone read this leftist book put out by a low-end entertainer? too many of the hypocrites think we care about what they say. he should give away most of his belongings to the poor and move to sweden.
1,More pablum from an amateur,"Regardless of your political leanings, this book is not worth your money. I was lured in because of all the press the book got from the law suit. Do not make the same mistake. Absolutely nothing of worth contained within the covers. If you are thinking of buying this book for the laughs, think again. Fox's lawsuit was silly, but they got one thing right. Franken is never, ever funny. Really, he has never, ever been funny.He's not good enough, he's not smart enough and gosh darnit, his book is awful."
5,Vintage Franken!,"As good as Rush is a big fat idiot. I couldn't put it down, except when I was convulsing with laughter. God couldn't have found a more worthy scribe to expose Bush et al. Ah, humor, that's the way to disarm them."
5,No More Lies,"That the Republican party and it's media channels have been stoking right-wing indignation through a tightly woven net of duplicity, fabrication, and deception -- technically known as lies -- is no revelation.The real novelty in Franken's hilarious and meticulously researched book is that the political left can do the same -- generate indignation throughout it's own constituency -- by telling the truth. He might be on to something here. I can only hope it catches on."
5,AL FRANKEN DOES IT AGAIN!!,Best book to date! While enjoying Al's wit & charm he opens his readers eyes to the insidious dealings of the many right wingers. I hope he is able to get his talk radio show up & running soon so we can enjoy his commentary real-time!
1,Lies and a Liar Who Tells Them: Franken,"This book is the biggest lie in the world, written by a liar who has no life and no character. Don't buy the book."
5,Funny And Informative,"Al Franken has outdone himself with this one. ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them"" is one of the funniest and most informative books I have ever read. Franken points out the errors of various right wing propagandist and informs the readers of his research to prove the errors. All of this is done with an edge of humor.This book is an absolute must read for the left and the right alike."
5,He tears them apart..,"Ann, George, Hannity, Billy boy.. oh man.. thye must really hate this book! So funny and articulate and insightful! I am from dallas and a republican and i had to give him cudos..well done.."
5,True Lies,"Arnold said at the Republican National Convention that Democratic National Convention should have been titled ""True Lies"". Well if you watched Fox News and all of the right-winged media outlets, you would actually believe this. However, Al Franken exposes the truth and shows the lengths that the Neo-Con machine will go to in trying to hold onto power. ""Fair and Balanced"" . . yeah right!!"
4,Great!,I loved this book! See alsoGeorge and Condi: The Last Decayed: A Collection of Poems from the Last DecadeBeaver Tales and a Canada Goosing: Poems Illustrating a Uniquely Canadian Perspective(See ArtisanPacificPublishing Website).
5,Liberal this and Liberal that...,"It's a good read. Funny and seems to be well researched, (By a team of Harvard Grads and Undergrads). It really puts the conservative spin on the ""liberal media"" into perspective. Being a die hard liberal, I hate the media and since it's supposedly so far on the left, I'm not too impressed with the bleeding hearts that seem to be making the neo-conservatives ears bleed. Too many ""moderate"" pundits use yelling and bullying as a debate device to push their conservative agenda across, it's nice to see Franken use actual stats, and research rather than he said she said nonsense and second hand information. I can see how exposing the great right lie, will get so many Republicans screaming for his head. It's entertaining, informative, and makes you realize the media is truly on the left, I mean your other left."
3,entertaining,"Whilte the book is entertaining, I found his argument for affirmative action to be less than convincing. He argues that a poor black kid with an SAT score of around ~1170 should get more consideration than a rich white with with an SAT score of around ~1250. Most people who are against race-based affirmative action probably believe that economic-based affirmative action is a good thing and would therefore agree with Al. They would, however, object to a rich black kid with lower SAT score getting more consideration than a rich white kid. While I think that a some form of affirmative action is necessary until an economic parity is achieved in racial groups, Al's argument didn't seem that convincing to me. Also, let's face it, if you are a poor Asian kid, you probably need a score of ~1300 to get a similar consideration with his or her white and black peers. :)"
5,An enjoable read -- even for a Republican!,"I know I'm echoing some of the other reviews here, but I just couldn't put this book down! I've never been a big fan of Franken's, but he's a pretty good writer I'd have to say.Franken goes after some of the big ""talking heads"" of the right -- Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity; he mentions Rush Limbaugh too, but he already devoted an entire book to him.I think most will enjoy Franken's fictional Vietnam story. I haven't laughed that well in a while! The ""Supply Side Jesus"" made some good points too.Of course, the main thrust of the work was to expose how right-wing pundits aren't 'purveyors of truth'. Franken is at his best in dissecting the statements of Sean Hannity, the over-the-top hysterics of Ann Coulter, and the 'spin' that Bill O'Reilly actually puts into his show. I would certainly recommend this book to fans of these three -- if only to discover how you're being taken."
1,Why I'm Important too.,"Instead of wretching at this title, I feel a bit of pity at this man. Stealing both the background and the ""fair and balanced"", it's clear seriousness isn't his biggest trait. He a satirist, and so anything his says (or ends uo saying) needs to be taken with a grain salt, specifically since he's trying out politics with that bitter twist of ""humor"". Maybe he should have chosen. ""Why I'm important and why you should listen to me"". And then bash Bush. In that order, please.(Giggle. Just LOOK at those glasses!)Cough....nerd."
1,Washed up nerd,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer. These are the rantings of a bitter, pathetic nerd. Al would do best to sit on his Stuart Smalley laurels and stay out of political discussions. I suggest he and his self-important Hollywood chums meditate on the old adage, ""Better to remain silent and appear the fool. . . "", this book leaves no doubt."
1,"Neither fair, nor balanced, nor well written","I found a copy of this book (?) in an airline clubroom, where it had been discarded by the owner or previous reader. After merely a few pages it became obvoius why it had been tossed aside. I skimmed through the remainder of the publication and found only more shrill, ultraliberal, tired argument presented with a total lack of writting style, logic, or intellectual content. As I left for my flight, I tossed it in the trash bin where it most certainly belongs."
1,AL FRANKEN IS A BIG FAT IDIOT,"is it too much to ask for a little CONSTRUCTIVE criticism? this book seems like just another conservative bashing book by another wacko liberal entertainer. mr. frankens political views seem to lie just to the left of timothy leary. if i want the far left viewpoint i'll watch cnn, msnbc, the abc evening news, cbs, etc."
1,Stepford Democrats will love it!,"This is a wonderful Christmas gift for hyphenated Americans because it illustrates the difference between Republicans and Democrats. The poor liberals can't bear to read an offending sentence, so Al Franken willingly gives them an anti-conservative diatribe to make them feel good about themselves, a refreshing pause in their self-loathing and Bush-hating. Poor Al can't even get the title right. A ""lying liar"" is actually a truthteller. Think about it.But yeah, I enjoyed the self-delusional tone of the book. Al is mad because most people saw the Wellstone memorial for what is was: a disgrace and an embarrassment for Democratic politicians. It's obvious why Franken was so thorough with his footnotes this time. He had to be - DUH - this is a serious work (wink wink nudge nudge). But the author can barely contain his hatred in his writing; it's a trivial work."
1,America Haters Stink!,"Mr. Franken, why do you hate America? Is it because it has made you a success in life? God Bless America!"
1,ANOTHER MOORE,"WHY IS IT THAT CREEPS LIKE MICHAEL MOORE AND AL FRANKEN CAN GET AWAY WITH THEIR LIES AND FABRICATIONS? WHEN CHALLANGED THEY CLAIM IT'S ONLY ""SATIRE"" FRANKEN HAD HARVARD STUDENTS HELP WITH RESEARCH ON THIS LIE FILLED BOOK. YEA HARVARD THEIR ""FAIR AND BALANCED"". LIBERALS JUST WENT NUTS WHEN FOX NEWS CAME ALONG, AFTER YEARS OF CNN,NBC,ABC AND CBS TWISTING THE NEWS TO THE LEFT HOW GREAT IT IS TO HEAR AN OPPOSING VIEW. MOORE AND FRANKEN WOULD BE PERFECTLY CAST IN THE SEQUEL MOVIE ""DUMB AND DUMBER 11"""
5,Interesting to see how 9/11 happened,"I'm glad somebody finally has the guts to point out that 9/11 probably wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the bush administration's inept cuts in various security budgets, its lack of starting the democrat inspired homeland security agency until AFTER 9/11... all to give all of the country's money to a select group of very rich people. just like in saudy arabia, where all the wealth is in the hands of very few.I would have called it a tax cut, except we had to borrow $500B+ to pay for it. if you have to borrow to give money to a handful of campaign contributors, then isn't that stealing?I wish the media weren't owned by a bunch of republican owned military contractors and so forth. at least then such stories would be given a reasonable amount of coverage.Thanks Al, for at least talking about this stuff a tiny bit. my only peeve is that too few people will be able to see this small bit of light in such dark times."
1,worst book ever,This is just plain and simple the worst book ever. I wouldnever waste my hard earned money on this crap!BEST USE IS KINDLING!
2,Facts have no place in this book,"I checked out Al Franken's book hoping to find an intelligent and funny look at modern politics from an opposing persepctive. What I found was a multitude of lies and cheap shots. Al Franken even failed at being funny, as his jokes mainly consist of swearing at people.I tried to give this a fair chance; I really did. However, a man who finds the New York Times to be 100% objective and finds Fox News to be so right-wing that it's fascist has some serious issues. His writing is on the level of Michael Moore's (that is to say, horrible and full of lies and slander).You would think a book that pruportes to be a ""Fair and balanced look at the right"" would do more than just insult everyone with whom he does not agree.If you wish to read a liberal who knows how to write and actually is funny, check out Bill Maher. But, please, leave this one on the bookshelves and stop buying into the publicity."
5,The best book of 2003,"Franken gets it right on the money, again!! The finest and funniest book of the year would be even more hilarious if it wasn't so utterly frightening. The likes of Hannity, Bush, Cheney, Fox News, and particularly O'Reilly aren't intelligent enough to know what hit 'em, but then again, neither are the dolts that support these Emperors Without Clothes. ""Lies"" is an utter and complete triumph that deserves its number-one sales ranking. Could it finally be the Al Franken Decade? Two too late, but every bit as edifying!"
5,My literary equivalent of a kindred spirit has arrived!,"Be still my heart! This book is amazing, intelligent, honest, well-researched, witty, and exactly what I've been looking for since I was thirteen years old. Al Franken is my hero! I wish I could elaborate more, & indeed I shall.. but, at the moment, having just finished, I can merely utter ""read it, read it!"""
4,I had my doubts before...but Franken proves himself,"This book was amazingly better than I expected it to be. I first read Coulter's book ""Slander"" and expected it to be a pure rebuttle to her book, but it was not! Sure, Franken uses her as a punching bag, but he points out that she set herself up for it. This book is not so serious, and should be read as a light and humorous view of the liberal side. His use of sarcasm sometimes makes it hard for the reader to tell the truth from an exaggeration or satirical remark. It bothered me at first, but after a few pages I realized how much it adds to the book. Unlike Coulter's dry (allegedly) fact-filled book, Franken presents his facts in an easily absorbable manner. This was a quick, fun read that raised issues and allowed me to think for myself--not propogandistic material against the other side (Coulter)."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Al Franken is a bitter attention-seeking man whose mean spirit and willingness to hit below the belt for partisan reasons totally eviscerate any vestige of humor from this book. He consistently repeats the same inaccuracies. (How many times does Bill O'Reilly have to refute Franken's version of things?)If you want to hear a shill for the worst and dirtiest strategies of the Democrat party, this is your book. If you were expecting anything truthful, humorous, or fair, don't waste your money."
2,Really? Who is telling the lies?,"I bought this book hoping to get a little insight into the anger that Al Franken exudes. I really don't watch TV other than news and commentary programs, so I know very little about him other than when he is in a dust up. Mr. Franken is a somewhat humorous wordsmith, but this is a bit of a narcisistic book. One gets the impression that Mr. Franken is trying to get into heaven by downgrading everyone else. The veil of deception by Mr. Franken is a thin one. I got about half way through the book and after the initial interst of Mr. Franken's prose, I could not continue for being bored."
1,Is this the Al Franken Autobiography?,the DNC Marxist funny man (When was the last time he was really funny? 1976?) If you think he is a comic you did not see his Stuart movie
3,Get Over Yourselves,"I love reading US Customer Book Reviews of political texts. 5 stars, 1 star. 5 stars, 1 star. ""This book is better than the Bible."" ""This book is the vomit of Satan.""Judge the book on its merits? - Hah! Screw that, We've got barrows to push."
1,Very mean-spirited book with little humor,"The book was not very entertaining and lacked the satirical aspect that I was expecting. It was filled with mean-spirited personal attacks against certain individuals with differing opinions than those of the author. Definitley not worth the money. If you must have it, wait until you can buy a used paperback."
3,"Review the book, people","Franken's latest is like his others -- it shows signs of real wit, but is tarnished by too much mean-spiritedness. If what I just wrote looks strange, that's because it's a politically unbiased opinion. You won't find many of those here addressing this book. Come on, people -- if you're a liberal you love it and if you're a conservative you hate it. Try reading it and judging the writing. It's . . . a . . . BOOK."
3,So how can we make the most of this information?,"I give Al Franken credit for courageously speaking his mind. Let's assume that what he has written is without prejudice (an assumption many would disagree with), then how can we make the best of this information? As I see it, the only reason to express negativity is to find the best solution to resolve the issues at hand."
1,You're an idiot,"if you actually read and liked this book. You get more truth, and less bias, out of the National Enquirer. He's just a bomb thrower, and he's not even accurate."
1,Fair and Balanced????,"Al Franken, fair and balanced review of the Right??Are you kidding me?? He is an ultra left wing Liberal.Give me a break"
1,Just not that funny...,This book was on par with some of Franken's earlier works- one sided and short sighted... He is no more honest than those that he accuses.
2,Fair and Balanced? Give me a break.,"Here's the good- the book is pretty funny.Here's the bad- this a book devoted to personally attacking Bill O'Reilly, in effect leeching off the name recognition the newsman has built up for himself. I'm a liberal myself, but Franken's immature personal vendetta against O'Reilly is sleazy and uncalled for.2/5"
1,are you serious?,"You libs crack me up. When a conservative writes a book, you dismiss it as factually incorrect.(as if you researched it) Someone you agree with comes out with a book, and you swear by it. You even use it to disprove those you disagree with. As if their book has some mystical claim on the truth. I am lucky in that I don't have to pay for these books. I buy conservative books, and a liberal friend buys liberal books, and we swap."
2,More shrill whining from the left,"Reads like the democratic debate the other night, shrill shrill shrill. Might find some ground on college campuses though.Some mildly amusing parts in the book, hit and miss like his writing on SNL.Don't bother."
1,Not funny. Just garbage,"I was amazed that anyone could fit so much garbage in a book this size.Franken who is a has been (who never really was) gets all his facts wrong. While this in itself is not surprising since its almost expected these days from franken, there is nothing even funny about the book or the Author.Its just misinformed, and poorly researched Faction.I did find a use for the book though in my bathroom, though the paper on a roll is cheaper."
1,Fair? Only to the Democrats.,"If you are a Democrat and dislike anything Conservative, then you would love this book. Basically this is written for a specific audience.Fair? Far from it. A fair-minded person would debate issues but not attack others just because he disagrees with their ideas and opinion."
1,Appropriately Named Book,"The best thing that could have ever happened to Al Franken was Fox mistakenly giving him any press coverage. His book is in the vein of Michael Moore. Short on facts and full of hyperbole. Dont waste your money. More importantly, dont waste your TIME reading this book."
1,Liberal...What Do You Expect,"Liberals need to learn what a ""Lie"" is. Making mistakes is not a lie. Ann Coulter is not a 'liar'. Al Franken makes no conclusions in this book. Proves nothing and shows that Liberals hate America now more than ever."
3,Worth a Look,"As a conservative, I have a problem when it comes to Al Franken. The problem is, he's pretty damn funny. Now, I don't care for Al's point of view on almost every issue, but, with the exception of P.J. O'Rourke, we Republicans are a little short on the humorous side. Franken scores some easy points of off Ann Coulter and garners HUGE laughs with the Chickenhawks chapter, but he fails to make a convincing case that the media is not biased (particularly in the wake of Rathergate). And yes, I know Fox is biased to the right, and I admit it...but even NPR won't admit a leftist bias. NPR!!! But such is the divided society we live in.Liberals should love this...conservatives with a thick skin and a sense of humor will enjoy it, too, for the most part."
5,"Accurate, Funny, Reassuring","As a progressive thinker living among pro-bushies, the book is reassuring that if I am crazy, at least I'm in good company. You'll laugh, sigh, worry, and fall in love with the author and team Franken, assuming you were in agreement even before you bought the book.We all get basically the same news. Roughly half of us interpret it the way Franken does. The other half interpret it the opposite way. That seems to happen no matter what the news is, 9/11, 2000 election, invasion of Iraq, etc. It is this phenomenon that I would like to see Franken explore in his next book. It could be very enlightening, funny, and more useful than characterizing the other side as idiots and liars. While I agree with Franken, I also tend to believe that some of opposition are very sincere in their (misguided) beliefs."
2,Interesting material but tends to deviate into the crass,"Frankin wrote some very funny material for SNL, but I'm sortof mixed in my view of him as political pundit. Some of his material is interesting, although it's loaded with a heavily-left slant. At times his material is crass, and questionable, but I do enjoy his sense of humor (some of the times)His visit to Bob Jones university just seemed out of place, and really depicted him as something of a bully looking for a fight. Ironically, hearing his treatment of BJU caused me to look into them more, research, then their homeschool curriculum and actually start using it, so in an indirect way I'm thankful to Franklin, but again, I don't understand why he included Bob Jones unless he was using mockery of people of faith for ""laughs"" in his book. Not funny."
5,A spoonful of witticism...,"...helps the ugly truth go down. Al Franken helps make the immense corruption of the conservative right much more pallatable with his amazing sense of humor, personal accounts and (gasp) bonafide facts. Not only did this book manage to wholly tick me off, but it managed to do it while also putting a smile on my face. It has also opened up a new foray of entertainment into my life...anything that comes out from ""right field"". Truly priceless!"
1,"Vote Democrat, it's easier than getting a job.","Honestly. All I have to say is read this book yourselves so you can laugh at how Al Franken makes a fool of himself. And as for the media being so ""right winged"", take a short visit to www.hollywoodhalfwits.com and on the left hand side(liberals just hold up your hands and choose the one that makes the L) there is a list of all of the left winged media halfwits. Click on any one of the many names and read a little about what they've said on the air. After doing so, think again about the media being so ""right winged"" ."
1,Al could work for the NY times..,"What a waste of paper. Al, you stunk on SNL and you stink as a propagandist."
1,Infantrile tantrum,"The Left can't bear the fact there's a news channel or commentator they can't control, or who doesn't accept their revisions of reality and mythologising as some sort of revealed truth. This book is an infantile tantrum, and one feels the author would benefit by a change of diapers and the application of a pacifier. Poor little thing! This book made me feel a lot more warmly about Bill O'Reilly, although as a trade union lawyer I didn't think of him as a natural soul-mate before. Attaboy, Bill! The adults are on your side!"
1,sophomoric,"To compare Franken's work with anything beyond a sophomore's piece in his school newspaper would be dangerous. He assembles a group of willing Harvard students with his same agenda and seeks to ridicule everything and everyone with whom he disagrees. Childish and sophomoric. Read his piece on Bob Jones University. After our sophomore year in high school most of us learn to stop ridiculing and teasing people we don't understand. These Harvard students have not gotten that far and Franken apparently never will get there. Grow up..... Hopefully those students might, Franken never will."
1,Al Franken and liberals love to hate,"Great review from the Bakersfield reader. Most liberals suffer from self-loathing and typically invoke their love for ""the children"" when in fact they are all too willing to use tragedy to suit their agendas, whether it be Al Franken dragging the Wellstone family through his mud and bile, or Al Gore using the near-death of his son to garner sympathy. Liberals like Franken refuse to confront their own dark sides. While they recite their politically-correct sweet talk, their inner selves secretly hope that more soldiers die in Iraq so President Bush doesn't get re-elected, but oh yeah, they ""support the troops"". Scratch the surface of the typical liberal and underneath a monster lurks."
5,Exacly What America Needed,"Al Franken is a national treasure. His scathing expose of both the current regime, and the media machine which has collectively decided to look the other way, is both brilliant and funny. I was at one point, laughing until I cried at his volleys at Bill O'Reilly. Although ""thinking"" is something that conservatives have had a difficult time with over the past few years, this book (even if one disagrees with his politics) forces the reader to THINK. ""Lying Liars..."" is the perfect counterpoint to the pablum generated by the likes of Coulter, Hannity, et al.I do find it interesting that the reviews which uniformly give this book ""one star"", do not actually review the book. Instead they regurgitate the GOP party line regarding liberals and Democrats. I find it hard to believe that any conservatives actually purchased this book, are able to read it, and felt compelled to review it."
1,New book same old drivel,"Franken, Moore, Kim Philby does it really matter who wrote the book!?! You find the same old socialistic crap wrapped in a warm, fuzzy and severly outdated 70's SNL-era, type bit. Back then at least you had Belushi, the funny one, to cover for your bad writing.Dude's, as Moore-on would say, your Eurotrash wannabe model of politics doesn't work. Get over it captalism won! Not all corporations are evil and not all republicans are Tammy Faye Baker. What you better hope is that all Democrats are not Barbra Streisand.Hey genuises how about some solutions instead of the sophmoric pandering to the undereducated, terminally-high neophytes on college campuses. What's that you say? Oh, that's right it would severly cut into your revenue - not to mention your pungtang quotient.This book sucks!"
1,Socialist - Is that what you what? = Read this book,"Lies, should have been the title of this book. Because Al Franken told them. He must be living in a fantasy world with the rest of the socialist. Get real Al! Come back to planet Earth!"
1,Franken-whine,"Finally, the mindless Bush-haters have a hero in the notoriously unfunny Al Franken. I saw the Wellstone memorial on C-SPAN: the liberals turned a serious service into a tasteless campaign rally. The same kind of thing happens when you show Democrats a videotape of the Ron Brown funeral where Clinton is yukking it up, catches the camera, and feigns tears. Democrats will swear up and down that's not what happened even when confronted with reality. The problem with Al Franken and most Democrats is that they're not thinkers, more like emotional reactionaries. They just want to ""do something"" for ""the children"". Any decent conservative can dismantle Franken's arguments in about five minutes because like most Democrats, he is afraid of facts. I think Franken did better work as one of the worst Saturday Night Live performers ever. The most hilarious outcome of this book is the ""liberals get tough"" act. Can't wait to see the liberal radio network fail for lack of real intellectual debate..."
1,STUPID WHITE MAN,IS MR. FRANKEN ONE OF THOSE STUPID WHITE MEN WRITTEN ABOUT IN MOORE'S BOOK. SEEMS SO. HAS HE EVER WRITTEN ANYTHING ORIGINAL OR DONE ANYTHING POSITIVE? CAN'T HE EVEN COME UP WITH A DECENT TITLE? WHAT A BORE!
1,Dissapointed,"Based on the title, I thought the book was about Clinton, Kerry, and all the other democrats who flip-flop stories more often than I eat dinner. Instead, this book was a rant by a comedian whose most credible source was the New York Times...I rest my case. Oh well, I guess people who turn to the Times for real news would probably like this book..."
1,Frankenly my dear....,"Al Franken used to be a funny guy. As his liberalism has become increasingly strident and increasingly left wing, it seems that his charm, wit, and appeal have diminished to the level of a sledgehammer. What a tragedy. This book collects some of Franken's more vitriolic rants in one handy-dandy collection for the wild-eyed, frothy-mouthed, zombie-like Bush-bashers to enjoy. If Al Franken wants to see a lying liar, he only needs to look in the mirror...Stewart Smalley he is not. Fact checkers and truth lovers need not bother with this book, unless they need a doorstop (for a very lightweight door). At least John Stewart, who's politics I dislike, is funny. Al Franken is to politics what Chevy Chase is...uh...to comedy."
1,Distortion of facts,Al Franken needs to do his own research or fire his researchers. This is a string of unsupported facts or facts twisted beyond recognition.A fair and balanced look can never come from a person like Al Franken who is from the far left spectrum. It is better to check the facts yourself. Al Franken does what he accuses other people of doing.
1,"Written by a ""comedian""???","Nothing fair and balanced here. It's a lie to say that this is anything but extreme liberal biased crap, and mean spirited to boot.Read Michael Savage's The Enemy Within if you want a glimpse into what's going on in America."
1,The best way to describe Al Franken...,"... is ""he cracks him up"". Surely no one else can find this self-righteous egomaniac funny. He offers no insight or original thought; this book seems more like it was written by a junior-high student. Glad I read a friends copy and didn't waste my money!"
1,Haven't We had enough from both sides,"TRUTH: We get the very same rhetoric from both sides.I'm sick of it. There isn't anyone out there who doesn't have an agenda and doesn't skew it all to benefit themselves. Franken, O'Reilly, Limbaugh, Boortz, Combes are all the same wearing different ties with different hats on.TRUTH: There is no real truth anymore. It has been beaten to death and destroyed through political correctness and the new ""I feel your pain"" culture that has taken over America. Truth is now whatever anyone wants it to be. This way no one is responsible and we can continue on with our throw away society where we throw away relationships (serial monogamy), throw away children (who have to keep the names of their sisters, brothers, half-brothers, half-sisters, step brothers and step sisters, aunts, uncles, etc. straight).THERE IS NO REAL TRUTH; ONLY AN ACCEPTABLE ONE. DON'T YOU THINK??? What a crock and how gullible the consumer is for continuing to buy and buy into this crap."
1,More Left-Wing Lies from a Left-Wing Extremist Liar,"Chalk another one on the scoreboard of liars who consistently distort the truth, fabricate ""facts"" and ""statistics"" to fit the extremist left-wing agenda. If you want good liberal reading material, look for a book from someone who can think on their own and isn't just another mouthpiece the extremist left wing-hijacked Democratic Party power-mongers, and toss this one in the garbage from where it came."
1,I hate 'em all,"Al Franken, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Michael Moore, Joe Conason, Bill O'Reilly, etc. I despise all of them.Grown adults who spew venom and act like children. All horrible people who make you want to take a shower after reading their bile. As another reviewer rightly pointed out, this is the 60's generation coming into their own: spoiled, intolerant, self-absorbed, materialistic whiners.Oh, and those people who blame 9/11 on either President Bush or President Clinton? Scum. Absolute scum who use that tragedy to advance their agenda. May the hottest place in hell be reserved for these idiots."
1,hateful and trite,"I think Bill O'Reilly brings out the worst in liberals. Like a pack of classroom misfits sniggering at bathroom humor they demean themselves with gusto.This book is written at such a low level (with a team Harvard's finest no less)that I read it standing around a discount store waiting for my husband to decide which auto wax he wanted.The 'facts' are really nothing more than liberal wishful thinking. There is a breathtaking hatred suffusing the entire work.Look, I don't like O'Reilly much either but the terrible truth is that he reflects 'popular' opinion and the real target of all this bile is the common man. Liberals seem completely out of touch with the people who make this nation powerful and great.I am endlessly amazed at how blithely a liberal will quaff poison and then look to see someone else suffer and die."
1,Stunned at the breathtaking idiocy of this book.,"This waste of paper isn't even worth one star. I'm by no means a right-winger; in fact, rabid extremists on either side are devoid of any capacity to reason whatsoever. Anyone who would buy into this massive load of hooey is as big an imbecile as Franken."
1,NO,"The question is, Does Al Franken speak the Truth? Upon analysis and conclusion, the answer to this question is: No!STEVEN TRAVERSAuthor of ""Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman""STWRITES@aol.com"
1,Al Franken is the idiot,"This author can't even defend himself in a public forum. When attempting a response, it's obvious that his claims are based on lies."

1,AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"""LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM"" SHOULD BE USEDBY AL FRANKEN FOR HIS AUTO-BIOGRAPHY...IT WOULD BE HIS ONLYCONTRIBUTION TO THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE!"
1,Franken isn't as funny as Franken thinks he is!,"Let's face it, this book just isn't funny, or even accurate. Franken couldn't even come up with an original title. Instead he ""borrows"" from the fox news network in an obvious effort to boost sales. Don't waste your money. If you consider this a must read, get it from the library. I'm sure it's not in high demand. Better luck next time Al!"
1,Something for Franken to think about...,"Firstly, you wouldn't have this bestseller if Fox News and some of its pundits didn't exist. Secondly, you're just making your name off of hurting other people. Yeah, sure, you have your emmys and stuff before you published your books, but I never heard of you until you called Rush Limbaugh a big fat idiot on the hardback cover of your book. Thirdly, you lied at least seventeen times (according to frankenlies, dot, com) in LIES (pretty ironic I would say). That's more than Bill O'Reilly! Sorry, Al, but I'm still sticking with Fox News and Rush Limbuah."
1,total waste of time,"reading this book was a waste of my time.... the only people Frankin will be able to convince are the weakminded and the ignorant.just because you site sources doesn't mean what you write is true, or even close to the truth.just like his stuart smally bit... this book is a work of comedy than any investigative truth"
1,the liar who wrote this book,"it's strange that when a LIBERAL wants to make a point he or her reverts to name calling and vague facts. Not once did I find any of franken's arguements valid or compelling I consider myself moderate but if this is the future of LIBERALS I may have to change the way I veiw things. This reminds me of if you tell a lie enough times it becomes true... Fair and balanaced Mr. franken HARDLY. You give LIBERALS a bad name!!!!I would like to dispute the so called facts of this book but there are so many inaccuracies or nebulous facts that I don't have time to write a novel safe to say I think this is trash and I don't want to be considered LIBERAL, Left,or Democrat for fear I will turn into a liar and teller of Half truths as Mr. franken has..."
1,The left doesn't like opposing views,"The left has been upset with the erosion of their monopoly on the media. When an outlet does not impune conservative values, the call it a pupper of the ""vast right wing conspiracy."" Worst let, the washed up skit writers become political writers. Botton line, Limbaugh is not longer fat, but Franken is still an idiot."
1,This book is so bad I had to throw it away.,"Al Franken continues his fall into insanity in his latest garbage laden attempt at writing.These are the type of rants you expect to read in a psychiatric profile, not a published book.Don't even waste your time."
1,Who's watching the watcher?,"It's truly no wonder so many Americans are political cynics. Franken claims to be policing the right, identifying scoundrels and liars, yet only appears to be able to do so by spinning lies of his own as fast as his little liberal lips can murmur. Check out frankenlies.com for a small sampling.In the end, anyone who reads this book can accuse Franken of not only lying, but of stealing the valuable time that one might have spent doing just about anything else."
2,Is this guy funny?,"I didn't find this book particularly funny, nor do I think that the writing style is very good. The book, starting with the title, has a juvenile name-calling frat-boy style. A premise that conservatives are liars and mean really don't hold a candle to this diatribe from a pretty much failed comedian. Great revues from the New York Times would be expected, but don't buy the book if you are a serious follower of politics. It's mean spirited and fluffy."
1,"Lying Liars? A little redundant, and quite idiotic...","Since when has Al Franken been a leading political mind? And what does he know that doesn't come from the media? Let's look at the facts. It'll take more than ""wit"" and ""humor"" to convince me that Franken's ""facts"" are legit. I'll stick with Rush, thanks. This read doesn't even deserve one star."
1,Truly Unpatriotic,"From reading the various negative reviews from like-minded, conservative, patriots, I have determined that Mr. Franken is no good. As the conservatives have pointed out, he is the one lying. I understand that it is not worth their time to actually point out his lies, but I believe them since they love America and Mr. Franken does not. So if I had a copy of this book, I would burn it. Thank you fellow conservatives for your thoughtful reviews."
1,AL Franken,Al Franken is a typical democrat fascsit in disguise communist. He harps on education when george Bush outperformed GORE in school without claiming to invent teh internet. Cliton failed miserably and we had 8 years of stagflation hidden by a stock market illusion. Bush rocks and today we found Saddam. This book is trash by basically a trash talking left wing goon who simply makes up new realities on every page adn tries to be all witty by insulting celebrities like Bill O'reilly by makign up stories about them.
1,A Horrible Book,"This is truly one of the worst books I've ever read, with flawed points that make no sense. It often seems that Franken makes a point to be funny more than he does to make rational points...the points he does make are half-baked and ludicrous. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
1,Not worth the time,I used to respect Al Frankin but after reading this book I realized how he is the one feeding us the bs. His book is inaccurate and is filled with strident references towards people that are very respectable people
1,A Zero Writes from his Buttox,"This dud was NOT funny on Saturday Night Live and Has done NOTHING since. How easy it is to make liberal/socialist happy. Just write a big lie,call it a book and all the other ZEROS will rush out and spend that nasty old tax refund on it. Trash to the 10th power !!!"
1,The Franken Family Book Club,"Can you imagine living with these people? Here's a sample dinner conversation:Al: Boy, that Anne Coulter sure is a nutcase.Franni: Yeah, and Bill O'Lie-ly is splotchy. <kids laughter>Al: Hey, did you know that I did a few USO tours?Franni: Yes, and you almost got shot down! We really do support the troops, don't we?Al: Well, we like to say that, but secretly I want more U.S. troops to die so I can help elect a Democrat into office.Franni: Hey, it's only a couple a day. Well worth it.Al: These people on Amazon are vicious, calling me a greasy, cross-eyed, lumpy, geek.Franni: Well, you do kind of resemble a retarded chipmunk. Just kidding honey!Al: I'll get 'em back in my next book, but first I'll need a face transplant to overhaul my Groucho Marx features.Franni: Oh, and don't forget down there honey. I want that little caterpillar to turn into a butterfly.Al: <blushes>"
1,Another one of those books,"I wonder why Mr. Franken authored this book? It certainly was not to inform or offer any positive solution. Like so many new books today by name recognized people, only a few come to mind that truly inform and offer solutions to some of the problems America faces. Catherine Crier is one of those authors. Nothing against you personally, Mr. Franken, but your book needs to be dumped in favor of Ms. Crier's. You will thank youself."
4,Nail on the head,"Wow! What can I say about this well researched and thorough book? Franken knows his stuff and puts it to the lying, deceitful right-wingers. At times, he's a bit pedantic, but that is absolutely overwhelmed by his attention to detail and persuasive arguments that the conservative movement is out to do an ""extreme makeover"" on America."
5,"Great job, Al!","Did any of the people who rated this book with only one star actually bother to read it?!?! Franken does a first class job at exposing how many Republicans distort and factually mislead the public. His analysis of books by Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, and Sean Hannity were FACTUAL and undermine their integrity. He does so truthfully and without spin. Even the most die-hard of Republicans should read this book and take a hard, honest look at who's out there publicizing their beliefs (after reading the Ann Coulter chapters, I can't image ANY true republican wanting her as a party spokesperson.) Reading this will change the way you listen and think about the news."
5,The sexiest progressive since Michael Moore...,"Al Franken has three things the subjects of his book never will: wit, vision, and excellent research with foot notes (take that, you bellicose blonde barracuda).The man knows no fear, and regales us with tales of facing down the conservative power-mongers on their home turf and challenging their most successful lies ""up close and personal"". He has been in unique positions to cover topics such as Paul Wellstone's memorial and other public and political events with an insider's understanding and an outsider's rage.Excellent work, Al!"
5,In-your-face funny while thoroughly informative.,"Never knew much (or, really, anything) about Franken before this book -- which I really only learned about because of the lawsuit by Fox. Wow! What a funny, persuasive, informative mind! Loving it, laughing and learning at the same time!!! With footnotes and, on occasion, photographs of documents referred to. Cuts through the c--p we've been being fed largely by our ""free"" press like a breath of fresh air -- which you have to breathe between laughs."
5,Anyone Who Can Make Bill O'Reilly Squirm Has My Attention,"I am not a Republican, nor am I a hardcore Democrat. I prefer to think of myself as a cynic. I do, however, grow very suspicious of anything that benefits big corporations. The Bush Administration has pandered to Big Oil, Big Energy, Big Mining, and people with big incomes. Haliburton, Bechtel, WorldCom are all benefiting from no-bid contracts in Iraq. Bush lied. Cheney lied. Rove lied. O'Reilly lies all the time (just talk to his ex-co-workers at KATU in Portland, OR). Hannity only lies when his mouth moves. Coulter is a scatterbrained liar that can't argue intelligently. It was nice to see someone finally call them on their lies and expose them with precise and well-researched evidence. I'm looking forward to seeing the lies that the lying liars will craft about Al Franken. I only hope that TeamFranken is available for round two."
1,Go back to SNL,"Al Franken is a gifted comedy writer. Somehow he, and his fans, got the idea that he is some kind of journalist or that his whimsical opinions offer some valid social comment.Read Paul Krugman, or Tom Friedman or some other liberal commentator who does legitimate research. If you want to see Al Franken's talent watch Stuart Smalley videos."
1,Ad Hominem attacks only,"The best expample of what this book is all about is his criticism of Ann Coulter (who I think needs to be criticized). She refers to one of her books in an interview and says that the book has lots of footnotes. Al Franken points out that there are no footnotes in the book. Sure enough, hes' right...there are no footnotes....they're actually endnotes. She misspoke......so he calls her a liar! And, of course, that makes everything that she says and writes a lie! Very childish and I would suspect very damaging to his own political party."
1,I love this book,"NOT! What trash, I thought this guy was funny, but he's nothing but an idiot and he shows it here. Fair and balanced? Now that's funny! I returned this one fast, and washed my hands. Should be recycled along with the author!"
1,Maybe they should READ the book next time...,"Why is it--statistically speaking--people find a negative review less helpful than a positive one? I mean, we're talking about people who HAVEN'T read the book yet. Answer that and you'll understand why the Left is so insidious (the ""Left,"" not two or three people). Notice how all the negative reviews are ""seen"" as being MUCH less than helpful than the positive ones? For example, ""13 of 126 people..."" and ""29 of 367..."" What? Twenty-nine out of three hundred sixty-seven! Talk about busting the odds! What we have here gang is yet another Left-wing conspiracy, an ""Amazon"" Potemkin Village. Yes. I'm afraid the ""pros"" have been caught at their own game: lying through their teeth. As the old adage goes, ""Liberals never let the facts get in the way of their opinions."""
1,I like Al Franken but I found this book unimpressive,A friend gave me this book as a gift and I wasn't at all moved
1,www.frankenlies.com,www.frankenlies.com ... Franken and the Harvard team are challenged ... on their facts!!
1,Waste of Time,Don't waste your money. This book isn't filled with facts. It's just a bunch of rants to get attention. Typical Al.
5,I don't feel alone anymore,"This is a fantastic book! His chapter on ""Loving America the Al Franken Way"" put to words how I have been feeing since September 11. I love America. But I don't believe that loving America means hating everyone who isn't ""America"", or who makes suggestions for improvement.I had a hard time putting the book down. I'm sending a copy to my sister in the Peace Corps, and a friend in Denver.Although, I might have done without the ""Operation Chickhawk"" chapter. (I think that's what it was called...)I look forward to his next book. I'm a new fan!"
4,Fun read & Pretty Informative to boot ... but...,"Al Franken does a good job of dissecting deliberate misquotations & twisted statistics from various conservative personalities & media sources. And he keeps it all going in a very engaging read.I consider myself a liberal - but I frankly would have liked to see him to stick to the facts w/o the couple of fiction stories he includes in the book. Note that he DOES call them out as fiction & says it clearly (not in the footnotes).As per the facts, there definitely are a TON of them. Very informative read - I will definitely be watching the news & other media more closely for liberal or conservative slants.I would definitely like to see more books in this vein (w/o giving in to occassional flights of fiction) that do a thorough & entertaining job (tough combo!) of taking apart conservative media sources & commentators that are either clearly just lying or are talking w/ absolutely NO EVIDENCE to back up their case."
1,Pathetic,"I was given this book and asked to read it. I thought the title was a bit biased, however I read the book. If you are into left wing propaganda and lies, without any evidence this is the book for you. I think Franken is far worse than anyone that he reviews in his book. For instance his chapter on Ann Coulter is entitled Ann Coulter: Nutcase. And then he proceeds to tell you that she is a liar since she used end notes instead of footnotes, and she had so many of them that she was obviously lying.If you can find humor in a very poorly documented book that calls everyone else a liar without producing any evidence, this book full of useless diatribe is for you."
1,If you don't see it his way,"Al Franken is a moron with moronic ideology and if you don't see it his way he has no compunction about salandering you,your family or anyones for that matter.He has no class and is just an ass.Thomas Jefferson said""I may not agree with what you have to say,but I will defend with my life for your right to say it"".Al Franken would put his moronic spin on it by saying ""I don't agree with what you have to say,you are wrong and I would kill you if I could get away with it for disagreeing with me"".I saw him on T.V. using the most vile and foul language at some politicians rally.I give this book no stars.Avoid it like the plague."
2,very funny.,"not really ha ha ha funny, more like ""i can't believe they think this is factual funny""this is another case of when actor's try to become smart and play politics.mr. franken please go back to SNL, we all had fun then.i actually enjoyed the book though. so i give it 2 stars!"
5,A Call to Arms,"Franken laid out a powerful case. While I would not expect this book to change the minds of dyed-in-the-wool conservatives (even those who admit to reading past the first chapter), I hope that this book convinces others, as it has me, to take an active part in the next presidential campaign. Bush and his administration have got to go."
5,Amazing,"An humorously smart and amazingly honest look at the new main-stream media in the U.S. today. Franken sticks up for the large number of us who can't stand the Coulter's and O'Reilly's of today, but are not sure why. After catching them (and many others) in pretty glaring whoppers, he goes on to add his quick wit and commentary that will make you laugh out loud. I could not put this book down from the moment I read the introduction. Of course, coming from the left, it's own inherent bias arises from time to time. However, I find it very difficult to refute most of the points he makes. This one's a page turner."
4,Brilliant Satire - Rigorous Scholarship,"I laughed on nearly every page of this rigorously argued book, written by a brilliant comedian with the help of a team of Harvard researchers. The extent to which the Right tells lies is beautifully documented. Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and other right wing hatchets are exposed for their shocking fabrications. After reading this book, you'll know why Fox News (one of its targets) tried to stop its publication."
1,Just pitiful,A more clueless lib may never be found. & the fact that he keeps a straight face is to his DETRIMENT. =P
1,A rotten little boy with a book,"I won't waste my time rebutting every single thing in this book, which is all either complete distortions or oversimplifications used for comedy (such as it is).Needless to say, if you buy it you've wasted your money. Try reading something enlightening and not this malcontented gibberish from a bitter underachiever."
5,My Eyes are Open,"Al Franken did a fablous job on this book. Al went afterevery big name Republican with the facts. After this bookmany would have to admitt that the Republicans use alotof [information] and lies to get their point across. TheFranken team did a sensational job at exposing their lies.I'm sure that Hannity, Coulter, and O'Reilly will just notrespond to the thrashing that Franken gave them in this book.I especially enjoyed Hanitty's made up graph. It is easy to proveyour point when just make stuff up. Team Franken has named theLying liars for all the world to see. It was a great read. Ifinished it in two days."
5,A good compendium of the lies of the right wing media,"I often pick up the books of the right wing media personalitiesat Costco and thumb through them just to pick out the lies.Franken exposes all the ones I've found, but goes much morein depth in his research.The sad thing is that their are so many uneducated people thatare being misled by Coulter, Hannity, and O'Reilly, and thatnever will learn the facts about how these individuals playfast and loose with the truth."
5,Exposed Lies,"Franken does a fantastic job in exposing the lies and lying liars who tell them. This book clearly identifies the propoganda and lies conveyd by right-wing conservatives in a rigorous and researched manner. Everything is referenced to a legit source.This book serves a reading with outstanding humor for those who seek entertainment while maintaining a tone of serious political dialog, in terms of the issues most Americans are primarily concerned with.Al Franken's stand is the kind of steadfast approach needed in the Democratic party.On a personal note, reading this book had me laughing all the way. Read every print in the book to ensure I didn't miss any of Al's hilarious! humor."
1,Less Than Frivolous Junk,"Hypocrisy is never attractive, and Franken leads the mob in unhumorous attacks on anything vaguely anti-Democratic Party or anti-Left Wing. He would be better served, for example, if he used extensive footnotes ala Ann Coulter, or if he indicated where her sources and quotes were either fictional or incorrect. Obviuosly, Franken would rather attempt to be cute instead of utilizing reseach and quoting his sources. And the snippet on Vietnam??? That was 30 years ago and initiated by a Democratic president. Best feature of the book is that it was given to me, and I didn't have to contribute money to either Franken or his publisher."
1,Stealth lying at its best,"This book is a masterful work of lies. I myself checked on three sources Mr. Franken used and found that this book is more written with ""facts"" that Franken made up than real evidence. The only source, of the three, that even existed was a NY Times article which was quoting a web page of a fanatical leftist from San Francisco. The article was being used out of context to support an idea Mr. Franken conjured in his own head. Being a liberal I am outraged that Mr. Franken feels the need to lie in order to support liberal ideas. Please buy Alan Colmes book if you are looking for an intelligent, TRUTHFUL, liberally-based political book."
1,Fitting Title,"After purchasing this book, I found it odd that Franken LIED to Ashcroft in an attempt to obtain material for the book itself, then formally apologized for his LIES. In an easily found-on-the-net letter, Al apologizes for fraudulently claiming he had received abstinence stories from people like Condi Rice for his book (a simple google search will turn it up if you're really interested in TRUTH). Somehow now I find it difficult to take anything Franken says as gospel after that. In fact, the title of the book is a perfect description of the author. Consider this carefully before reading it!"
1,"More cheese with your whine, sir?","Just another in a series of whinings from the left. Al Franken takes small points and blows them into major issues. Anyone with a brain knows that in order to maintain the views held by the average liberal, lying is vital. Yet, Mr. Franken feels that pointing fingers at conservatives is the best way to cover his own tracks. Maybe it works with some people, but hopefully most will see him for what he is."
5,Franken Does It Again,"Al Franken has written yet another brilliant satirical work. Only readers with a well-developed sense of humor will appreciate the sometimes raucous humor. Not only is the book funny but is very well documented and researched. It expounds not only on the dirty tactics of the Right but also on the foibles of their leading luminaries - Bush, Cheney, Rove and Ashcroft. Not spared are media pundits such as O'Reilly, Rush, Coulter and Hannity. Franken tells tales on himself about some of his own far-out responses to the Right's way-out actions. Looks as if the Left is learning rapidly to emulate the tactics of the Right. Hold on Folks! Looks as if this is going to be a year to remember as Franken promises another such book just before the election next year. I can't wait!"
3,"Well-written and interesting, but preaching to the choir...","Al Franken is a good writer and he makes his case against Bush & Co. well, but a lot of what he reveals re: Bill O'Rielly, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing nuts is just more preaching to the choir. People who buy this book (like myself) are likely to lean to the left politically, and thus won't learn anything new. It is a good read, though, particularly if you were like me and stuck on an airplane for a few hours with little else to read besides the SkyMall catalogue. :)"
5,A Defining Career Moment,"I'll admit it. Franken isn't as funny as he was in his SNL prime. But laugh out-loud humor isn't what this book is about. We liberals are really lucky to have our Al Frankens and people of that ilk to keep hope alive in the last 4 years. I agree with some other people on here. Franken for president, absolutely. He should at least help campaign for whoever the democratic nominee is. And yes, I do live in Texas. Amazing, isn't it?"
5,Must read this book!,"By far the most entertaining political book ever written. Whether your left or right, you will get a real charge from this book. Other than his hilarity, the thing that sets Franken apart from the other books in this genre is that he actually documents what he says and shows the truth about the people and policies he criticizes. He takes Bill O'Reilly apart in a way O'Reilly simply cannot defend. He unmasks a lot of rightwing screamers like Coulter and exposes them for exactly what the title promises -- liars. For any but the most rabid rightwingers who don't care about truth, this book is a powerful and convincing read. If you're intellectually honest, you will love this book, no matter what your politics."
5,Hilarious compendium of factual rebuttals to right wing lies,"First, I'd like to start with a review of the reviews. I just slogged through as many of the 90 or so 1-star reviews of this book as I could take and did not find a single one that presented documented refutation of the facts in ""Lies ..."". All I read were opinions about the Mr. Franken's opinions. The whole point of the book is about the Right's distortion of FACTS, yet not a single Righty can find fault with Franken's facts; they just disagree with his OPINIONS.And you don't have to agree with those opinions to enjoy this book. It is funny and it is informative. I especially appreciated his exposure of the pro-business economic biases of the mainstream press.So buy a copy for yourself, and another one for the Dittoheads in your life."
2,Pretty stale book,"I was hugely disappointed by this book. It just isn't that funny. Franken has a smug mannerism and his constant reference to his army of fact checkers was annoying. Well, the fact checkers didn't do that great of a job - he listed the Sanyo company as Korean. I bet they were surprised to hear that at the company head office in Japan."
5,The Truth,"Must Reading - you'll see what huge liars Fox, Ann Coulter, O'Reilly and Hannity really are and how the Right Wing Press is trying to control your mind!"
3,Disappointed,"I am a moderate with some liberal leanings. I was interested in reading this book because I am tired of, and not a little alarmed by, the extreme right wing movement that has been pervading the media and politics in this country. The average citizen, like you or I, is not in a position to counter the distortions and manipulations of the truth that are being foisted on the American public. So I had high hopes that Mr. Franken's book would do just that.While he does do an admirable job of countering misrepresentations with facts, he also allows himself to fall into the name calling, character assassination, and meanness that is the shameful calling card of the people he is opposing. He surrenders the high ground, when that high ground is his strongest weapon. Had he simply stuck to comedy and facts I think that the book would have been much better."
2,Eh... only entertaining.,"If you're a liberal, you'll love it. If you're a right wing conservative, you'll hate it. If you're a moderate, its only entertaining at best, no real insight and someone who is not bipartisan can see through this book."
5,Poor conservatives... to cowardly to face up,"I like these reviews in here from conservatives who's idea of good literature is mindless pontificating on slave like patriotism.Contrary to the opinion of a few cowards, this is a great book, no doubt about it. Liberals, aka college graduates with high IQ's, do not worry, this book is well written and hilarious to boot.Let the slow witted conservatives (aka people who had daddy buy their way through life) live and die in their ignorance, this book isn't for them, it's for the people with brains enough to see the country is better off without the likes of Bush or Rumsfeld. Or for, god sakes, that pyshopathic wh*re Condoleeza Rice.In closing it was a great read. 5 stars."
5,Al Franken Rocks!,"This book is GREAT!So is Al!If he were single I'd marry him!And I'm HOT!But that aside, Al tells the truth in this book and anyone who denies this is not paying attention.But then,you could run an idiot on the Republican ticket and Republicans would STILL vote for him. (But we know that already.)As for Ann Coulter,I've always said she was either completely evil or really stupid.I don't think she's stupid.I'd also like you to note where I hail from.That's right, Cape Girardeau ,Mo.,Limbaugh Land!(God,help me!)So, you see, I know Rush and my hatred is well-founded!I don't hate by reputation alone but from along history of loathing,up close and personel.(Dare I say 'Fair & Balanced?)Love ya,Al!"
4,"So much spittle, so little time","I am amused by how conservatives are squawking over Al Franken's book. I can just picture them at their computers, ranting and leaving spittle on the floor as they yell."
5,Funny. Now go on to Remick,"This book was funny. There. All my thoughts in four words. Now I suggest you go on to read Bennett's ""Book of Virtues"", or better yet, Remick's ""West Point: Character Leadership"" to remind us of the way it is supposed to be in our Country. No joke."
1,SNL meets NPR...,"Even though the book attempts to be a political thesis, it comes out more like a comedy sketch. Mr. Franken can't shake the ""if it's funny, it'll work"" philosophy of SNL.Besides, none of his perceived enemies have been assaulting liberal pundits; what say, Al?Read it for the laughs, not for the ""insight""."
4,Eat this Bill O'Reilly!,"I doubt that Bill O'Reilly or Ann Coulter will much like this book. The book gleefully takes on the right wing and loves to focus on the Fox News Channel and Bill O'Reilly. Franken clearly is unintimidated by Coulter, Limbaugh, Ashcroft, et. al. which must be a source of incredible frustration to them. That alone justifies the price of the book.In any case, whether you like Franken or not, the best thing about this book is that it is very funny.I cannot say that this book is ""Fair and Balanced"" but who cares?"
3,Don't get me wrong...,"I really like Al Franken - however, when you are sending your kids to a religious (Jewish) school and knocking Christians (Bob Jones U.) for having a religious based institution, it really doesn't come off that well to a lot of readers, many of whom have already gone severely to the right - Also, it doesn't show a whole lot of prudence to glorify public schools that you don't send your own children to. Franken is good in some respects, but ends up acting more like a limousine liberal - at least his son had it right about BJU when he pleaded with Al ""Dad, leave them alone!"""
2,Better have a strong stomach to take this book...,"I found this book to be a little too droning for my taste. I liked Al's book on Rush Limbaugh. And the first few chapters of this book concerning Fox News and Bill O'Reilly are enjoyable, but the later 2/3 of the book are just hard to read. Al's shrill anti-conservative rant comes across as anything but fair and balanced. Liberal inaccuracies and falsehoods are downplayed as everyone is human and can make mistakes, and who could remember those arcane statistics anyway. While any minor mis-quote or inaccuracy on the part of a conservative is labelled as a LIE and a calculated campaign to discredit the left and deceive the American public. I find it very hard to believe that every Democrat and every liberal is pure and altruistic while every Republican and conservative are an evil horde bent on the total destruction of mankind. Give me a break. There are very few books that I put down and never finish. This was one of them."
5,"Brilliant AND insightful. Conservatives, you've been exposed","First of all, unlike many of the ONE STAR reviewers, I actually read the book. You should do the same, or is that beyond your capabilities?Among the many topics Franken covers are:* Fox News' right-wing bias* Ann Coulter actually IS a nut case* Bill O'Reilly IS a conservative (and a creep)* Hannity and Colmes is a sham debate program* The myth of a Liberal media* Dubya and his whole administration are liars* Bush's policies make the wealthy wealthier (and screw over the poor and middle class)* and much, much more!All with humor and a relentless persuit of the facts (Team Franken, take a bow). Plus a short novel (Operation Chicken-hawk), Supply-Side Jesus, a one-act play, this book should be read by all Americans. Especially the ONE STAR people!"
4,it made me laugh,"so i was going through reviews of anne coulter's latest book, and there was a five star review that i found to be quite hilarious. he commented on coulter's amazing prose and her impeccable research. he then pointed out that she had pages of footnotes, pages and pages of footnotes...that literally made me laugh out loud. you know who i don't like, anne coulter! i love that franken is able to make me laugh by simply giving me the facts."
4,Loving America the Al Franken Way,"Thank you, Al Franken! Thanks for proving that truth can prevail and we can raise above the mindless name-calling and taunting and deliver a book that is both funny and insightful (and, perhaps inciteful as well). Operation Ignore made me angry and Supply Side Jesus was brilliant. Now I can watch Fox News and laugh my butt off!"
5,One of the most refreshing political books,"Al Franken has injected a refreshing change into the books we've seen come out of the political spectrum in some time. He keeps a witty humor throughout, and tells things straight-up. He really is a truth teller. I double checked a number of things he's pointed out - such as Hannity's mischaracterization of the Reagan vs Democratic Congressional budgets. They are absolutely true, and he does the best he can to show where the radical right is lying.In the end, the growing right wing radicalism in this nation at present will destroy itself if it keeps on the current path.Great job, Al! You aren't just preaching to the choir, you are being as witty and respectable as you can be! This book is more then just political blathering; its humor, truth, and really interesting reading."
5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book,"I finally stopped watching the Fox News Channel in 2004. I just couldn't take it anymore, I would listen to these people spouting off this ridiculous awful stuff and get so angry. Sometimes it seems like the world has gone crazy - can't people see what is really happening here? Do the people at the Fox News Channel think all Americans are stupid? Do people look at the Fox News Channel from other countries and think it means all Americans are like that? Franken's book was like a vindication. I laughed and laughed and got a huge kick out of it.One point remains clear - politicians and journalists and voters and even Amazon reviewers are human beings. Dig long and hard enough, and you can make anybody out to be an idiot or a liar or worse. (Some people can do this to themselves without any help from anyone.) As soon as people start slinging mud, it detracts from the issues. Most of us basically want the same things, like freedom and security, so let's focus on that."
5,Thank you Al!,Thank you so much Al. This book really opened my eyes. Everyone should read this book.My only complaint is that I would get so mad after reading some chapters I could not get to sleep.
1,Funnier as a US senator,Al Franken is funnier (and a lot less relevant) as a United States Senator than he is as an author or than he was on Saturday Night Live.
5,Bitterly funny,A gruesomely funny assault on conservatives and right-wingers in general that had me bending over in laughter. Expect to get funny looks from people while reading this book. I'd recommend it to anyone.
3,What's up?,"Why does Amazon let us read excerpts from ""Treason"" and only allow prospective readers pictures of ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them""?"
3,not bad...,"This was an enjoyable and entertaining read. For the most part, the facts seem pretty spot on. As in all books of a political nature there is going to be some skewing of facts due to bias, but in this case the skewing is done intelligently and with an eye towards convincing the reader rather than intimidating them into believing. I read through a great deal of other reviews on here that seem rather politically biased and bent more on condemning the author because of his political views rather than critiquing the book on its own merits.Please, if you are going to give the book a negative review it would help those of us who actually think for ourselves when we read political literature if you would say what particular facts are wrong and citing a source to back up your statement rather than pointing at the author and calling him a big, fat liar. This goes for the Frankenphilic dittoheads out there. Ok, I got it. Your'e a liberal. So am I...now tell me WHY THIS BOOK IS GOOD."
5,Dr. Michael L. Johnson,"I've always considered myself an independent who leans to the right (Yes, I voted for George W in 2000). I love Al Franken all the way back to his SNL days. I've read all of his books and this one his is best! At times hilarious and controversial, Al usually is right on. Do I agree with everything in the book? Heck No!!! I'm not a ""mined-numb robot"", but overall this is a great read. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading Mr. Franken's work to date, get on it!!! It's only a few more months before the election.Dr. Michael L. Johnson author of ""What Do You Do When the Medications Don't Work--A Non-Drug Treatment of Dizziness, Migraine Headaches, Fibromyalgia, and Other Chronic Conditions""."
3,Thank Bill O'Rielly,"I have to thank Bill O'Rielly and the people at Fox for putting aside the first amendment and suing Al Franken and his publisher. Had they not pulled that media stunt, I never would have heard of this book. Al may not be the most respected political commentator around but he does expose many ""conservative"" commentators for the bullies they really are. Al's another one of those guys that conservatrives wont like or agree with but thet can take some lessons from him about how to go about disagreeing without coming off like a sanctimonious lout. Bill?"
5,Funny AND Smart,"I confess that I prefer Franken's ""Limbaugh"" book, because that was funnier, and there are a lot of darker essays here--but I suppose that's because we live in darker days. Still, Franken brilliantly combines the intelligent if pedantic style of Joe Conason (""Big Lies"") and the in-your-face ad hominems of Jason Johnson (""I Hate Bush and So Do You""). Republicans who criticize the book for not being even-handed apparently overlook the fact that Al Franken backs up his statements with FACTS, which, I also noticed, the Bush defenders don't deny."
5,"The Truth Hurts --->Coulter, O'Reilly, and Hannity","It is always nice when reading an intelligently written and researched book to have a nice laugh, as well as, gaining insight into the lies the Republican party Henchmen(Henchwomen) have been feeding our citizenry. Franken supports all of his claims with research and facts, which Franken discusses are different than the right wing tools of of speculation, exaggeration, and fabrication used commonly in Coulter's book. I reccommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the media propaganda machine and party bias in the media.Seek the Truth, Love the TruthExcellent work Al!! A MUST READ."
1,Al Franken is satan,"This is just another piece of garbage from the Democratic Bush-haters. Nothing in this book is real -- it's all lies, made up by folks who think, as the Nazis did, that if you tell lies long enough, some fool will believe it. Why anyone would publish such garbage, much less sell it to the public, is beyond me -- they must lack all character in doing so. If there were honest lawyers out there, these authors would be sued for the libel they have foisted on us. Dont' bother buying this trash!Al Franken must have been severely beaten by his parents as a child to have turned into such a miscreant adult. Someone commit him before he hurts himself."
1,Don't be Deceived,"This book is a FICTION! A political satire. The only thing that comes close to TRUTH are a few words on the cover ""Al Franken"" and ""Lies""."
1,Cashing in...,"This book has no research, just a Franken rant for getting money from thise dumb enough to actually pay money for it."
1,On a roll!,"I have NOT read this book, I have just read enough exerpts to feel that I am able to express my opinion in a review of what I have read. In fact, if you'll note the title of this review you'll get a clue.The only reason I would even think of buying this book was if it came in a roll! That's where all of Al Franken's books belong.Then it could at least be put to some good use."

1,CONGRATS AL QAEDA!!!,"Big win in Spain!!!!! Personally, I think your methods are a little over the top, but hey- a wins a win, right!!!!Good luck in November, and whenever the British elections are!!!Kerry, Mike Moore and this dope Franken are pulling for you!!!"
1,A Limerick,"There once was a guy named Al,Who couldn't score with a gal,With a book for the masses,He fogged up his glasses,While smooching his teenage pal."
1,This is just a silly premise for a book.,"Is anyone tired of baseless bias yet? If you like to read spin and poorly written content, then this might be the book for you. There is a lot of hatred within these covers. I'm always surprised at how much vitriol can come from that ""touchy-feely"" left. I used to be much more liberal, but it is people like this who push me away from the Dem's."
1,Al Gore lost - Get over it,"As usual, Franken's writing is boring. I'm not a Republican and not a Bush fan, but this book is a classic example of what's wrong with the left. Dripping with hate, no real substance and lot's of whining, and all seasoned with with personal attacks and childish insults. It's no wonder they can't make any valid points on the issues or win elections anymore."
2,Not too good!,"Al Franken was a mediocre comedian at best. As a comedic writer for SNL he was marginally better. As a political activist, he fails miserably. Though maybe I am biased. I don't agree with basically anything that is in this book and I am grateful he has no say whatsoever in the policies of this nation.Just the fact that he thinks the idea of a ""Liberal media"" is a lie started by the right who actually own the media speaks volumes for how deep his hatred and ignorance of the ""right"" is.My advice, read the incredible COCKPIT CONFESSIONS OF AN AIRLINE PILOT, by Stephen Keshner... much more funny, more poignant, and definitely NOT Politically Correct."
1,STINK FIST Al Franken NOW! He Deserves It!,"Where the hell do left-wing leftards get off on demeaning the right as not legitimately challenging Franken with evidence......Yet all one has to do is look at the crippling majority of leftarded reviews where they don't even cite the points with which they claim to be endorsing Frankenazi with. That's because leftards are SHAMELESS--they blast everyone else for not refuting Frankenazi in a substantive way, yet the leftards are the worst Politically Correct sheep by themselves, who simply bow to every last B.S. that their false god Frankenazi writes, without even questioning its veracity. Leftards are the most criminally biased sheep--like a bunch of pathological racists."
1,"Liars who write books that are ""Fair and balanced""","Short and to the point---venomous; unsubstantiated ; illogical; paranoid--in the clinical sense! Did I say a pack of demogogic, ideological leftist mytholgy parading itself as a serious book? It is all that you would expect from a Franken. Lineage does count.As William F. Buckley says---liberals lie as a matter of choice.So, it is obviously the book of choice to give your liberal friends. And Al, with Garafolo (now that she is sober, she does pay attention to politics---hey, her words, not mine) are obvious choices to be ""stars"" in the new liberal network---joining ABC/CBS/NBC/ and CNN"
1,The self-importance of being Franken,"Al Franken takes being a jerk to new levels each time he decides to take his blather and turn it into a book. His paint-by-numbers approach, (malign the conservative right, spice it up with mis-applied statistics and self-serving anecdotes, be annoying and antagonistic rather than insightful) points only to the intellectual vacuum that his brand of liberalism has become.What makes it worse is the rate at which his swill is devoured by purchasers of his titles. Maybe if sales of his titles would drop, he would take the time to write material worth the death of so many trees."
1,what is the truth?,He has a tendency to footnote his own work to make it look like a fact. He is just as bad as any liar out there.
1,Is Franken trying to be funny?,"If Franken is trying to be funny in this work of fiction, then I missed the boat. All I see is a lot of petty and pernicious name-calling. Franken has taken the political discourse of this great country to a new low as he continues to spew forth unwarranted profanity-laced venomous vitriol - the likes of which our country had not accepted in the past, let alone witnessed. His conniption fit on Howard Dean's campaign stage was apoplectic at best as he childlishly pilloried Brit Hume with his nonsensical tirade - while Howard Dean looked on admiring the whole chirade. Unbelievable."
1,Lies and the Lying Liars...,Al Franken has never written a book worth reviewing. Why anyone should read him is an indictment on our society.
1,Lying Liars by Al Franken,"I used to be a fan of Al Franken's. However, with the publication of ""Lying Liars"" he has become the lowest scum on the Earth. He is simply dog-crap. After reading the Rush Limbaugh book and now the Lying Liars book, I will never again read Al Franken's garbage."
1,"The rich yet miserable Al Franken, God bless 'em...","""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: An Unfair and Completely Unbalanced Look at the Right""by Al FrankenThe above is the title that Mr. Franken should have used for this ridiculous and trite publication. I wanted to like this book - really, I did - but I just couldn't take it seriously enough to the obviously predisposed attitude that Mr. Al takes.I criticize the right almost as much as I do the left, but this piece of asinine statement after asinine statement naturally made my eyes roll over and over for its imprudent attempt to belittle the ""dishonest"" right. Puh-leeze, Mr. Franken - your pandering to the left is as obvious as Rush Limbaugh's for the right. You and Michael Moore (clearly your lost soulmate) need to get together and comfort one another."
1,It's astonishing what makes it onto the best sellers list.,"The humor seemed really forced. Politically un-sophisticated.If teeth-grinding, anti-conservative humor is your thing, I highly recomend Bill Hicks over this book."
5,Alternately hilarious and outrageous,"How does one review a book that elicited alternate bouts of hilarity and outrage in its reader? I should have taken notes or marked passages as I read it, so I could share with you all the places where my eyebrows shot up and my mouth dropped open.Franken takes on the conservative right again, in much the same manner as in his previous book, Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot. He quotes the right's own words back to them, and points out where they got it (whatever ""it"" may have been at the moment) wrong, plus where they manipulated, distorted or outright lied about the facts. He cites his sources, he names names, he points fingers, and he doesn't cut anyone any slack.I've never been a fan of Saturday Night Live, so my sole exposure to Mr. Franken has been through his political commentary. I love this guy. Go Al!"
4,"Researched, funny satire, much like The Daily Show","I thought this book was extremely funny. Although a little more left wing than John Stewart tends to be, it's the same sort of humor that leaves you saying, ""It's funny b/c it's true."" And then you're left with a grimace as you it hits you some of these frightening things are true."
4,It's Funny Cuz It's True,"This book, first and foremost, is hillarious. A solid portion of my favor towards this book is due to the fact that it made me laugh out loud about two times a page. The other reason why I enjoyed this book so much was because finally somebody exposed the truth about the true media biases in this country. Although pretty harsh at times, someone had to counter attack Bill O'Riely and Sean Hannity. He does a good job of poking fun at some of our President's policies that don't even help the people who need help, and makes a great point at saying that criticizing the government is patriotic. I also enjoyed how Al writes about the truth of W.'s abominable environmental track record. Mr. Franken also impresses me with his method of proving the truth to the readers. There are a few kinda extraneous conservative bashing parts that he got carried away with, but overall, I recomend it. You wont be able to help but laugh."
5,"Great reading, funny and infuriating","Al Franken somehow manages to take a very serious topic, get his points across clearly, and still make his book great fun to read (when you're not gnashing your teeth over some of the things he reports). He's very good at laying out the chronology of a lie: you can follow how it began, grew & twisted and where it is now. If I were one of the people he was writing about, I'd be trying to find a place to hide out, especially if I had lied about some document since he has photos of the documents in question demonstrating that what was said was completely untrue (see the voter registration form for Bill O'Reilly). I appreciate his lack of euphemisms; his willingness to call people on what they say and do; and his wonderful sense of satire. I am thoroughly enjoying this book and recommend it to anyone who has an interest in politics."
1,Al is a Franken Idiot !!!,"Sorry but he wasn't funny at SNL and nothings changed. Yeah, go ahead and spend your hard earned money on a worthless book by a washed up comedian who found a new lucrative career. You will not become a better person from reading this trash."
1,Poor Franken just needs a hug.,"The title of my review says it all. If we all took the time out of our busy schedule to give Al just one hug then maybe, just maybe, the world would be a better place."
1,Factually challenged?,"Before you fork over your cash to Al, you might want to check www.frankenlies.comAl and his 14 Harvard buddies have been challenged on their facts."
3,Lying on the Square,"On several occasions Franken refers to his ""fabulously successful"" endeavors. This is an example of an absolutely necessary lie. Or is he kidding on the square? My guess is that he is lying on the square.Franken justifies his wordiness by noting he is paid by the word. Much of the content he attempts to excuse by giving credit to TeamFranken, a hand picked group of professional students. Franken very poorly distiguishes himself from his targets and in the process turns his own family members into liars. He owes his son an apology, an exaggerated EXCUUUUUUUSE ME will not suffice.This is an average book by an average guy. Some of it is very good, some of it is very funny, some of it is very contrived, some of it is very ugly. It is unfortunate that Franken sacrifices quality for quantity."
1,Franken is a Liar,"So so so immature. Franken is a ranting, out of control, ninkumpoop. His book is devoid of fact, full of hate and unfunny.Franken has perfected the art of namecalling as a substitute for political commentary. Grow up Al!"
3,"Funny, very funny, but that is about it","A typical, but humorous assault on process rather than a real look at the issue of the ""hystrical right"" and Media Bias. Written as a counter to books like ""Bias"" and ""Slander"" I think the humorus jabs at process rather then real argument on the claims reinforces the arguments of Goldberg and Coulter rather than debunks. Franken takes issue with Mrs. Coulters footnotes actually being endnotes, rather than engaging her arguments. Which is a shame, becasue I agreed with his premise, but he doesn't follow through. Mrs. Coulter does represent the hysterical right, but it is clear Franken represents the content free,but far more amusing left.I give it three stars becasue it is funny.Other recomendation on Media Bias I would suggest ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"" by Neil Postman. Postman puts forth no arguments on Bias, rather describes a battle for our attention spans that drives the media."
3,Playground arguments,"I'm a democrat and I give this book 5 stars. This book uncovers the lies and deceit spread by the republican party.I'm a republican and I give this book 1 star. Its just a deceitful democrat spreading lies about the Bush administration.Hmm, time to grow up methinks."
2,Somewhat hypocritical,"Yes, Franken ""proves"" that many of today's conservative voices have ""lied."" But the problem is that he picks out just 2-5 examples for each person (i.e. Coulter, Hannity, Bush, etc.). When someone writes a whole book, or speaks on the radio for 3 hours every day, a handful of mistakes doesn't neccessarily make them ""liars."" I'm sure someone could carefully go through Franken's books, and find ""lies"" as well. It was clear that he had a political agenda in writing this book, and the transparency of this agenda inspires only skepticism for the reader."
2,Too serious for a funny man,"We all need Al Franken to keep the Right honest or, as Al would say, to MAKE them honest. The big problem I have with this book is that Al, a genuinely funny man, starts to take himself too seriously and gets kind of angry at times. Too bad. His earlier book, ""Rush Limbough is a Big Fat Idiot"", was much funnier and less angry. As an aside, if you've seen Al Franken on TV lately you'll notice that, while Rush has slimmed down, Al has become a really fat guy."
1,"A left wing hit job, but better than most!","This is better than most of the trash from the left, but that is not saying much. Al Franken is funny and intelligent, but hopelessly biased and over his head on many of the issues in the book. And, it would be nice if he could be funny without making the personal (and false) attacks."
1,The rantings of a deranged mind,"My true rating would have been negative five stars, but it wasn't a choice. Franken missed his calling. He should have written for Pravda. Maybe North Korea or China could use a spokesperson. Franken is just the left's version of Baghdad Bob. His hypocrisy knows no bounds. If any of the previous reviewers are actually conservatives, I'll leave the county. I'll even go on the same boat with Baldwin and company."
4,No More Conservative Denial,"I really enjoyed this book. Lots of laughs, lots of truths exposed and lots of insight to how it all works. Franken's writing style is clear and conversational. I didn't go so much for the ""Supply Side Jesus"" section or the Vietnam story, I thought both were lagging humor and insight and considering how much lying right-wing propaganda there is to expose out there, I wished he didn't waste the space with them. But they're both brief and don't occupy much of the book. Unfortunately the people who ought to read this book probably won't, and that's...ok."
4,"Funny and full of facts, but too much is too questionable.","This book backs what it says about the twisted and wrong things that the Bush administration has and hasn't done with factual references that are important for every American blinded by a propaganda laden, and sensationalist Fox News (The ultimate in Jerry Springer type media.), but Bill Clinton wasn't exactly the Prince that he describes him to be, and his personal stories are a tad questionable as well. An important book for any American who isn't a lock step lemming, and who wants to improve their great nation in 2004."
5,Lies and the Lying Liers who Tell Them,"Thank God someone is uncovering the madness of the far right and the lies and propaganda that gained them popularity. Oh, and it's hilarious at the same time that it is extremely informative and well documented."
3,Not Bad,"I enjoyed the way he more or less chewed Ann Coulter into tiny little bits, and, to a lesser extent, got points on O'Reilly and Hannity.(Of course, this brings up another point. With what Franken worked up on Coulter, why aren't Ann's books in the FICTION section of Amazon?)But he didn't do much to raise ""the level of discourse"" we hear so much about. Some of his work was just plain name calling, and the front cover photo of O'Reilly is a cheap shot."
2,Desert Island,"Is there anybody else out there who just wishes Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Michael Moore, and Al Franken would go to a deserted island somewhere and wait for our phone call to return?Anybody else weary of the political discourse being cheapened, compelling debates being marginalized, and bi-polar views of Left vs. Right being promoted? The trouble with a book like Franken's (and Coulter's) is that it preaches to the choir of those who live out their political lives through bumper stickers and mind-numbing, sound-bite driven cable TV political shows that invite extreme or bombastic guests just for the spectacle of it all. Is it any surprise that Americans are apathetic toward the political process when it's presented like this? Franken, like Michael Moore, is probably not a big fan of American-style global capitalism, but his first royalty check should remind him that he is not above sharing its spoils."
1,A Right Review,Maybe Al should stick to comedy but I guess that tougher than just being a finger pointing cry baby.Lets talk about ideas! Ideas are what matters. The best ideas win.
1,WHO IS THE MEAN-SPIRITED ONE HERE?,"Just the titles alone of Franken's book indicate how ready he is to make cheap shots (""Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat Idiot,"" and this one.) I found the book surprisingly not funny. It was written as a reaction to all the conservative books. I really got restless near the end."
4,My Political Bible,"This book, written by my best friend Art Franklin, has been very helpful to me. During my campaign to become the Governor of California, I have met many liars. Before I started, I had no friends. Now everyone wants to be my friend, even my enemies. Clint Eastwood wants to be my friend and so does Sylvester Stallone. And Jerry Springer. He keeps calling me at 2 in the morning asking if I want to go get a drink and a couple of broads. I always say no and give him Bill Clinton's number. I admire Bill Clinton. He lied but then he confessed. That took guts. Then he confessed that his confession was a lie. That took guts too. I give my constituents in California this solemn promise; I will never lie. And when I do, I will confess. Teddy Kennedy once told me that the truth will set you free. Tell that to Nelson Mandela."
1,Intelligent?,"Al Franken is not best described as intelligent. Oftentimes, his arguments fall by the wayside with lack of evidence much like Michael Moore's so often do. Liberal entertainers have not yet mastered the art of fact finding.I'd prefer reading Bill Maher any day"
5,Al Franken is the Anti-Fox,"Just got the book yesterday and I am nearly through. The chapters on Ann Coulter and Bill OReilly are a riot. I really enjoyed how he methodically dismantles several assertations in AC's book. If you liked Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot, they you will love this book as well. It is funny, and factual.My thanks to Fox for giving this book so much publicity. I was planning on getting it from the library, but when I heard about the suit I assumed it must be a great read. Thanks to the publisher for moving up the release date as well"
1,Better than Ambien if you're sleepless,"Franken, itching from the popularity of Fox News, scratches vigoursly at conservatives and conservative media who have finally earned a role among mainstream media. Before I finished this book I killed a moth with it. Hard to say which kept me from finishing - how disgusted I was with dead moth on the cover, or Franken's literary rampage."
2,True Comedian,"This is a funny book, on the whole, but also a mean book. What happened to us trying to get along with everyone, loving everyone? Mr. Franken is a true comedian, to the point that he makes fun of our own values by viciously attacking those that don't agree--what happened to peaceful resolution? There were times I almost felt like crying--he has single-handedly turned us into a bunch of attack dogs, even against our own (e.g. printing ""Colmes"" in subscript). Shameful, Mr. Franken, that we eat our own!"
1,LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM,"FRANKEN PROVES HIMSELF NOT ONLY IN HIS LIBELOUS WRITINGS, BUT ALSO IN HOW HE BEHAVES IN PUBLIC. THIS MAN IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF PROFESSIONAL HELP. HIS WHOLE AGENDA IS "" DEMOCRATS RULE"". WELL, FRANKEN DOESN'T !!!!P.S. ""0"" STARS-BUT THERE WASN'T THAT OPTION."
1,Pure Drivel!,"A waste of ink, paper and shelf space. An anything but fair and balanced look that is full of nothing more than useless drivel. This book shamelessly panders to the bitter, hardcore, far left. Who cares what the politically correct celebrity nation thinks. Formulate your own opinion! There are many more insightful tomes out there from knowledgable political anylists on the left and right. Don't waste your money or your time on this garbage."
2,"If this is the Bible of the Left, I prefer the real Bible","Is Al Franken funny? Yes, if you think name-calling and junior high-school-level sneering is funny.Is Al Franken accurate? Yes, if you think tendentious and extremely selective use of sources plus the mere mention of the word ""Harvard"" in conjunction with ""researchers"" constitutes accuracy.Is Al Franken witty? Yes, if you think clotted, nearly unreadable prose equals wit.Apparently, many Americans have concluded, despite massive evidence (albeit unwitting) to the contrary, that Al Franken is funny, accurate, and witty. Then again, in these post-modern times I guess that depends on what the meaning of the word ""is"" is.One extra star for managing to hoodwink hundreds of thousands of Americans into buying this idiocy."
2,poorly written,"As a liberal, I was eagerly anticipating this book. I was sorely disappointed when I attempted to read it, however. There is some very useful information in this book, but it was so hard to read, I couldn't even finish it. It's as if he gathered information from his research team and spewed it across the pages; there is no organization and it's very choppy. I don't know how it got past the ediorial assistant's desk (politics?)...Also, reading about how much he loves himself and how great he thinks he is gets a little trying."
5,Finally!,"Finally there is a book exposing the religious right for what they are. One doesn't need this book to come to the realization that Coulter, Hannity, and O'Reilly are dolts.... they were relatively easy targets. Franken's work on Rove and others of the Bush mob is where the book shines.I'm not a fan of Bill Clinton and disagree with quite a bit of Franken's political views, but one thing we share is a hatred for Neo Cons. Limbaugh, Hannity, Coulter, Falwell, and everyone associated with Bush top the list. I don't understand how some reviewers can claim this book isn't factually sound. How can transcripts and quotes be considered untrue or ""spin""?In any case, this book is absolutely hilarious and nails Neo Cons to the cross."
3,Al Franken is a liar?,"I love your work Al! I have since Saturday Night Live. You are a very clever and witty man. I read your book after I read Ann Coulter's ""Treason"" & ""Slander."" But your book isn't about the truth either... it's about, ""Hi I'm Al Franken and I'm correct about everything."" I just get the feeling that your interpretation of the truth is more important than the actual truth. So does that mean your book is full of lies? I am sure the truth lies somewhere in the middle of you and Ann. Without Ann's book, ""Lying Liars"" would've been about the size of a pamphlet. And Ann's books were actually a lot more fun to read."
4,"Sorry, this is one of those ""didn't help much"" reviews....","Why is it every time I read reviews for books like these there is always a douchebag with an agenda giving it ""no stars"" and saying it's all lies. I think that is particularly funny in this case given the name of the book. I have not yet finished the book as I have but just bought it. That is why I have given it a sub-perfect star rating. I can't give it 5 if he pisses me off at the end. So far I enjoy it greatly and don't think any of it is very hateful, even if it looks like it is. All jokes. Franken does a fine job at getting his info straight and mixing in humor so that you don't feel like you're just watching a liberal Bill O'Reilley."
1,Anger and the Angst filled Angryman,"Maximum of 1,000 words? About this book?He is angry. He has been angry for years.I can't take him seriously.This book is the evidence that he could be the next person to walk into a fast food joint and open up with a, oh, wait, he is far to liberal to use a gun."
1,More hateful lies from the sad little man-child,"Most of 'facts' in this book have been completely discredited. Not that the hate-mongers on the left actually care about facts. Everyone should read this book. Although it is a pack of lies from cover to cover, it is highly indicative of the modern American left. There is no lie too despicable for the left to tell. There is no person, or group of people the left will not demonize. As long as it leads to their goal of a socialist America with them as the central ruling party-elite."
1,Blaahh,"God awful, full of half truths. I wasted my money buying this book. I wish I bought Bill O'Reilly's book first, he is looking out for me. Al Franken is after money only, pure and simple."
1,"Real Mature, Al...Real Mature","If you can get past the juvenile title of the book...Heck, you really shouldn't get past the title."
1,hope god hits him with a bolt of lightning,Complete moronic drivel from a comedian trying to be intelligent about things other than stuart smalley...
1,Hate Speech is not Entertainment,"It is amusing to me that Mr. Franken is allowed to spout such hate speech in the form of 'satire'. His opinions are defamitory, and in many cases, outright lies. Yet he fails to include himself as one of the 'lying liars who tell lies'. This compilation of partisan smearing is downright offensive. Give it a pass."
2,Why bother with this book?,"If you have read Michael Moore, no need to bother with this book. Just like Moore, Franken perfects the use of copy / paste to edit speeches, columns etc by his favorite conservatives to instill a sense of humor into the GOP. Just like Moore, Franken generates a ""documentary"" of supposed lies and bias by conservatives that will be gobbled up by people of the left, unquestioned and untested. Why not? Ann Coulter does the same for the right. Same techniques, different target audiences. If you look for an in depth analysis of the bias by conservatives, keep on looking or read the WSJ and the Washington Times and think for yourself."
1,WHat a bunch of cr*p.,"This book is really sad. It's amazing how much attention this piece of garbage has gotten from the liberal media establishment. If you are looking for some revisionist history, or maybe you are missing the Clintons in the big house - then you may like this @#$%."
1,Franken ad nauseum,"Environmentalists (including those ELF folks who torched our lab at UW) should decry the sad and pathetic waste of good trees that took place to publish this disgusting missive from one of the many Democrat political bottom feeders. Franken's continual use of hateful rhetoric and misleading invective leaves little room for serious political thought, much less any kind of coherent message oh his part. He belongs to an exclusive gang of small men with small ideas, men who play a large part in degrading the political discourse of our nation.Rather than put forth a positive agenda for America, Franken continues the standard radical Democrat modus operandi of engaging the politics of personal destruction, rather than that of the cerebellum.Bottom Line: Even serious liberals and socialists can garner no more than cheap laughs from a man with cheap morals.By the way...One star is a generous rating."
1,A Liar writing more lies!!!!!!!!!,Michael Moore and Franken are brothers who were given up for adoption at birth. They are both outright liars who will say anything to advance their liberal looney agenda.
2,An excellent example of Soiviet style propaganda,"Mr. Franken combines inuendo with a few facts to produce an excellent example of the type of propaganda that, I thought, died with the Soviet Union. The style that mixes facts with satire that implies a truth that never was, is reminicent of Crocodile the old Soviet satire journal. Note the mixture of footnotes where the facts are solid and chapter references where they are not. The quotes of various right oriented commentators that he calls ad hominim attacks (e.g. calling Clinton a rapist)are well documented and used as examples of the tone of the Right, although the facts of the Clinton criminal cases are not disputed.His technique is Classical Marxist in character and is a dificult read for anyone not well aquainted with Marxist dialectic."
4,Needs more editing,"Appreciate the strong effort to be factual, and also 90% fo the humor. The chickenhawk chapter (about rightist draft dodgers) should be dropped from the paperback edition. It detracts from an otherwise fine book. It's a little overboard to maintain that Clinton: (1) is a liberal. Wrong, he's a centrist and not really a very good civil libertarian. (2) Did more to fight terrorists than any other Pres. He certainly did more than Bush 43. Can't agree that B Goldberg is in the same category with Coulter, Hannity, Beck, Limbaugh, O'Reilly. He's a couple of cuts above that crew. Although the obscenity wasn't overdone, some of it could be left out."
4,"""No Spin Zone"" caught spinning to the right!","With all the controversy between Liberal and Conservative, Left and Right, it's good to read a book that not only footnotes all sources, but includes photocopies of acutal supporting documents as well. There are few conservative books that prove their position so clearly.Sure Al Franken included some wacko stuff in a few chapters, we're talking about Al Frankin after all! But when it came to then facts, he proves himself dead on. Come now, ""the Levittown section of Westbury Long Lsland""?? Who's the real Spin Master out there?"
1,Comedy from Franken,"Al Franken is a terrible commedian and a worse writer, I have to assume this book is meant as comedy and he was trying to fool people into believing it was real, sort of a War of the Worlds thing. All he showed me in this book is how Al Franken can lie. This book is only meant for liberals who need some justification for there inane beliefs."
1,Too much intolerance!,"OK so I tried to give Al Franken's book the benefit of the doubt. The liberal/democrat stance has always been one of tolerance and that all conservatives are evil; however, as I read this book it became obvious how perfectly INTOLERANT liberalism, and Al Franken, really is. This book is a look through a set of hateful, intolerant eyes. Such hypocrisy deserves to remain on the shelf. If you are liberal or just looking to get revenge for losing the elections of 2000, 2002 and recall 2003, then this book is for you. Otherwise wait for your favorite DVD to come out, buy it and enjoy it, it will be money well spent."
1,Bless his heart; he's really just sad and pathetic.,"Years ago, Al's sophomoric humor appealed to me at some level. But, then I stopped partying every other night, graduated from college, and got a job. Now, bless his heart, Al's appeal is limited; however, not totally non-existent. I mean, you've got to admit that mug of his is still pretty funny.Oh yeah, the book. Let's see...all the words seemed to be spelled correctly (I didn't check every single one, however) and he did seem to have a handle on the grammar. Uhmm...I loved the cover. Yes, yes, the cover was just dandy; you know how I love that mug of his. And, let me think...oh, yeah...the pages were numbered just the right way and the book seemed to have sturdy binding.I'd expand my comments to include my thoughts on the content of the book, but my nine-year-old son just reminded me that that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. He's right, of course, and I've already said too much."
2,A 2 for humor,"In this name calling screed supported by facts void of context, Franken displays his alarming ignorance of economics and human nature. A cursory study of military history would disabuse the notions of any open minded person away from solutions dictated by Marxist theory, but clearly our author is anything but open minded. His mind is a closed shop, uninterrupted and unmoved by his factual inconsistancies, unfazed by his own ignorance, and aglow with the sense and certainty of his own moral virtuousness and its attendant superiority. What should we do with a dolt like this? Answer: put him on SNL and as his career wains subject him to being an objest of ridicule. Perhaps?"
1,what madness is this,"I hate this book, because Rush and NR said to. It is a perfect example of how the stupid evil weak traitorous liberals are destroying America, by questioning the President in every way. Without absolute faith our city on the hill will crumble like the bistro food so many effete liberals enjoy. I purchased this book simply to burn it, and show those fascist liberals what is what."
1,Clinton loved this book...,"So if the head liar loves it, the hateful liberals will adore it. Let us not forget that Frankens idol, Clinton was a do-nothing lying, and impeached fool.....and Franken proves himself a worthy student, sans impeachement.Are we sure that Franken isn't Rosey O. in drag?"
4,As if we didn't know the Right Wing was full of hatred...,"...the list of Right-Wing 'reviewers' on this site only confirms it.I'm not really sure how calling Al a ""commie"" is really going to help anything...in fact that review alone made me want to buy four more copies of Al's hilarious book.I don't categorically hate the Right - Hell, my brother married a (gulp) Republican, and I love her! (It's not her fault, it's how she was raised) - but I can't stand liars, and this book is full of them.Well researched, funny, witty, and a hell of a lot smarter than most people ""in power"" these days, this book is a must-read for anyone who is smart enough to see through the lies the media and government feed us daily."
4,Blinded by the right?,"I consider myself a centrist with leanings to the right and fairly conservative in my views but I found this one of the funniest books I've read in a long time. I think Al Franken tackles a lot of what I see is the biggest enemy our side has, our own liars (both sides have them). I've always thought Bill O' Reilly was an arrogant blowhard and reading about him getting caught and sand blasted with his own B.S. was worth the book price alone, but it gets even better as you go along. If you are ""blinded by the right"" I am sorry for you, he makes some great points and is truly entertaining. (Obviously written by some Farleft pinko POSING as a right winger)"
4,Am I really the first?,"This book is a funny but mild retort to the rightwingers among us.Sure, Anne Coulter, Sean Hannity, and Bill O'Reilly don't care afig about the facts (favorite quotation: Hannity says ""I don't havea lot of time to refute every fact here"") but they hardlycompare with the threat posed by the supine media, the mandatedelectronic (ie, corruptable, no permanent record, and provided100% by rightwing corporations) balloting, and the completedisinterest of Americans in the other 75% of humanity."
5,Great Fun For Political Junkies!,The most entertaining political satire I have read in years. It's like being at a beltway cocktail party with a hilarious host.
1,Funny but Foolish,"Al Franken is a bright comedic writer and there are some extremely funny quips in this book. However, if you are looking for a serious political commentary, this is definitly not the book for you. Al Franken is an extreme partisan whose tainted view of the world prevents him from writing a truly insightful book. Mr. Franken should stick to what he does best, writing comedic skits for SNL."
1,Al Franken may have a problem knowing facts?,"Al has it down that anyone who disagrees with him is a liar! Well, gee whiz and ole golly, what else is new?I want to recommend that everyone interested in politics in America read this book! Why? Because playing loose with the facts appears to be a cross political boundary problem and Al is in effect doing in this book what he is accusing his political opponents of doing: Lying!Franken is a real smart guy who is making money from the left! God bless the man and his capitalistic and monetary requirements that are apparently immense! I hope he spends the money during the 3rd quarter of 2004 as to help President Bush's numbers!Al, don't try to sell this book to Ms. Clinton, or you may end up with your head in a basket!"
1,Not funny and full of spin,"I used to respect Al Franken. He used to make his points with humor and wit, and rarely stooped to personal attacks. Unfortunately, now, he's filled his writing with Ann Coulter-like personal attacks and unmerited attacks. His book is filled with hate.Ann Coulter could never claim to be ""fair and balanced."" Why does Franken, her ideological opposite and just as bad, attest to that claim?"
1,Funny fiction,"Al Franken's book came in handy when I ran out of toilet paper...this guy is another one of those ranting lefties who's arguments are devoid of any real intellectual substance based in true facts and reality. It's all emotionally based, intellectually bankrupt but what the hell, free speech....""It's better to remain silent and appear stupid than to open your mouth and remove all doubt"" Al should have kepy his mouth closed....."
1,What a Joke - One of the worst books ever written,"This guy should stick with SNL and stand up comedy, because he sure doesn't have a political mind. Al Fraken and Michael Moore should run off together and just hold hands, because they are just a couple of ferries"
1,LOTS OF BITTERNESS,"I too barely got through two chapters prior to having to take it to the local library. Which informed me that they really didnt want anymore. They already had five on the shelf by people who had ""donated"" them. Full of nothing balanced in my opinion but more venom than I experienced in any book. I am sure I will not buy any more Franken books."
1,Al Franken lied: he does not support the troops,"Al Franken is the biggest liar of them all. He does NOT support the troops. He tells anyone who will listen about his USO tours so he can pretend that he really supports the troops, but it's a cover.By the way, Franken planned the confrontation with O'Reilly at the LA book convention. But he lies about that, too. It's all calculated to advance his pathetic career of attacking people. He's a loser who goes on radio shows to talk about other people.By the way, his friendship with Senator Wellstone is fiction. The Wellstone family wants nothing to do with this retarded attack chipmunk. Al Franken is an embarrassment to the Wellstone family.By the way, I hear that Franni Franken resembles Triumph the Comic Insult Dog."
1,Talk about LIARS,"This book was so full of unsubstatiated rhetoric,inconsistencies, outright lies and quotes taken out of context,it was outright laughable. How a ""book"" of page after page of vitriolic excrement could be published is beyond all comprehension."
1,I am Al's mom and I am embarrassed....,"Al was always a silly little boy wetting his bedsheets and generally making a nuisances of himself. He wasn't even potty trained until 14.And now I hear he has written a book? He should have used that book to wipe his rear. Lord knows he didn't use toliet paper to wipe his rear.Al, come home son, or I'll throw out your barbie doll collection."
1,Yawn! Another batch of pulp from a pseudo-writer.,"Franken has sunk to new lows. He attacks the person, not their views. He resorts to name-calling and innuendo. He has nothing new to say, nor does he say it in a new way. His writing is nothing more than an attack (dare I say Conserva-phobic) on the right. If he left the ad hominem attacks out, this might be mildly entertaining. Instead, he uses the Clintonesque attempts of character assassination and non sequitor to further his immature view on what people should be allowed to do and think.Don't waste your time with this book, it really is not worth it."
1,A joke of a book from the joker himself,"This book smacks of your tiresome left wing talking points. It stays at #1 or #2 flip flopping with Michael Moore's angry anti-american book, because the DNC along with other left wing groups buy these up in bulk. I'm from Minnesota and we know Al here. We're glad he calls New York home now!b"
1,Al Franken is a hypocrite and a liar,This book is boring .... and is itself a lie ... and is mean-hearted and mean-spirited ... I'd say go back to SNL but they wouldn't take you back ... I borrowed the book... no way would I pay for it... and I suggest you do the same ... It is not worth your money....
1,Don't waste your time,"I decided to read some of Al Franken's new book before I purchased it. The chapter on Bill O'Reilly interested me the most so I jumped right in. Never have I read such stupid, unintelligent nonsense. Mr. Franken wrote this book for dullards and simpletons. He rambles about some few mistakes that Bill O'Reilly made in claiming that Inside Edition had won a Peabody. Who cares! If you're reading this review at least skim a copy in your local bookstore before you purchase so you can decide for yourself. Even the most liberal of folk will find this reading an utter bore."
1,ANGRY LIBERAL WITHOUT A CLUE.......NAMED STUART,"MAYBE OL' AL SHOULD COME UP W/ SOME MATERIAL OF HIS OWN INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE COMICAL AND POLITICAL. WHERE ARE THE FACTS TO BACK UP YOUR INTOLERABLE STATEMENTS AND OPINIONS? DID THIS BOOK EVEN GET A ONCE OVER BY THE PUBLISHER? THIS GUY IS SO FAR INTO FANTASYLAND, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT 5 PAGES. WAS BETTER AS ""STUART SMALLEY"" REMEMBER STUART AL?"
1,Not a political commentator,I found the book childish and wouldn't recommend a writer that makes his points with ad hominem attacks and not facts.
1,If there was a liar out there,it would be this guy. I appreciated what he has done in the past but he really goes over the edge. His book brings down the level of discourse in this society and it is a real shame to see him embraced by so many. The loudest mouth gets the attention and this book is an example of that.
1,Disappointed....common propaganda!,A poor attempt to paint the media as extreme right-wing with nothing but lies to report. Suggests desparation in the mainstream media who are losing viewer/listeners/readers due to their poor and biased reporting.
1,Libs Don't Sound Convincing Enough To Brainwash Anyone,"Let me say that I too haven't read this book. Also, this doesn't make me as condemnable as what liberals have charged the one star reviewers for doing, and that is passing judgment with no basis. Instead, I too, like the reviewer pandorasdad, am going to depreciate the people on both sides of the aisle, as libs and cons are both over-the-top in their hardened party lines.However, i'm not gonna' be clement to rate this with 3 stars. I give this one star based on the stinging fact that's materialized, which is that the liberals are REALLY, just monstrously more hostile and corrosive in their reviews. Just looking at the last few liberal reviews, It's obvious that they refuse to retain any trace of civility and composure; instead willfully choosing to angrily lash out at anyone who doesn't subserve their liberal plan."
1,Sux,Sux...big time. Fully of lies and unsubstantiated/bogus information. Like all his books. Zero stars would be better.
1,Silly and Repulsive,"This guy is just another one of those whiny Liberals, who hate the FOX News Channel and Bill O'Reilly, because they are both unafraid to be fair AND BALANCED (and the LEFT can't stand anything being fair).I read this book, and almost laughed at how unfunny it is! This guy is a moron and it's unfortunate in this country, one does not have to have any common sense to have a decent following.The good thing is most sensible people and the true Americans know this is pure garbage, and won't take anything Mr. Franken says seriously any longer."
1,Not worth cutting a tree down,"Don't waste your money. If you really want this book for a laugh, wait until it gets to a half price bookstore."
1,"Lie, lies and more lies",This book is filled with lies from the left. If you believe this book please contact me because I have some ocean front property here in Milwaukee I can sell you for really cheap.
1,In need of a life Bridge Troll,"If you like to read fiction and like to read the ranting of a complete fool you are going to need to sink no lower than this book. It is remarkable that this untalented, hate mongering, no-life low-life is still around. The most positive thing I can say about the author is he would be a real natural with a bald head and wearing a turtleneck.{if you get my drift}"
1,"Franken is a ""liberal""? I don't think so.","His use of humor to disguise the weakness of his argument and lack of substantive facts has always bothered me.His unnecessary use of the racist slur, ""Jap"", on P.342 of this book has completely turned me off.This type of racist slur is unacceptable in any situation - and certainly in an attempt simply to appear funny.In my mind, Franken is neither a good ""liberal"" (as the label is used positively) nor a good American."
1,Liberals up to their old tricks,"Al Franken just perputuates the usual labels liberals have brought upon themselves. Ann Coulter's Slander calls out the usual liberal tactics Franken and so many other liberals continue to use. For example, attacking someone politically because of their physical looks. Case in point is the title of Franken's last book, but once again he isn't above doing that in his fair and balanced look at the right."
1,This guy has no experience except being stupid,"Al Franken is a little fat weasal (as opposed to a big, fat idiot).What a sorry excuse for a human being.If you have ANY actual ideas that make sense, let us know. Otherwise it is clear you are not qualified to opine, although it is your right, God-given, to continue to make a public ass of yourself."
1,Franken's a liar.,"Ironically, Mr.Franken got caught up in lie immediately after publishing the book. A lie that he responded to saying it was ""regrettable"" by citing a source that was made up. Liberal's look at this book as a bashing on O'Reilly and enjoy it because of O'Reilly's huge following. Yet, O'Reilly IS a political commentator and not a comedian. Naturally, he (anybody) will have a large following if he speaks to Americans critical mind. I'm sure all whom agree with the words of Franken also find the political commentary of people like Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Alec Baldwin, Danny Glover, etc. to be well thought out rationalization about politics in America. And if you believe that you probably also think that Bill Clinton was a moral man injected with family value's. Think critically when you read this book, and consider the source, just like anything else in life, liberal or conservative, black or white."
2,Al is no honest broker,"Franken starts with a sincere sounding mission of proving the lies of the right wing media (Coulter, Limbaugh, Hannity) but then loses all of his credibility. He claims for example that Ann Coulter ""lied"" when she said that Norman Thomas, the socialist presidential candidate, was Evan Thomas's (the Newsweek editor) father. He even has a satirical dialogue with Evan in which Evan denies the statement as if it were preposterous, wholly without factual basis! What Franken never admits is that Norman Thomas was Evan's grandfather, not father, context which would turn Coulter's ""lie"" into something less, such as a mistake. Thus Franken commits the very duplicity he so earnestly complains that the right is guilty of."
1,non-fiction?,Fair and balanced? This is far from nonfiction. Rates more up there with Michael Moore saying the president went awol. He should be added to the list of Lying Liars. If you want nonsense ask a first grader about politics and you'll find out more than the disinformation in this book.
1,Sad,"What a sad, bitter little man crying out for attention.Interesting that someone so devoid of honesty would have the cheek to call anyone else a liar. Mr. Franken needs serious Psychiatric help."
1,LAME....,"This book is basically one long Saturday Night Live political skit. I love Franken's humor and sarcasm. But, like a Saturday Night Live skit no one can honestly take this book serious. If they do, our nation is in serious trouble. One star for the clever political name calling and nonsense, and no stars for lack of research by Franken in order for anyone to actually take this serious."
5,A Plea to Save the Nation,"Al Franken has written his best book yet. His is a passionate and moral plea for the preservation of reasoned political discourse in our nation. The Right has aggressively set about to destroy our multi-party system by poisining the well of free speech. Franken makes a brilliant case that the Right is, at its root, undemocratic. The book is well researched, and hilarious. It is a mistake to read Franken's effort as 'just the same name calling, etc.' In fact and intent, he tries to demonstrate how ugly and debased the greatest nation on earth will become, and how trivialized our Constitution, should our precious right of free speech decline into lie, deceit, and false witness. Bless Al Franken."
4,"Right, Left, Conservative, Liberal, anyone really know the d","In some cases the reviews are more entertaining than the book. Al Franken is a funny guy, and we all know that humor, especially effective humor has more than a little truth. But this battle between Liberals and Conservatives is bizarre. I truthfully don't know, nor do I care, if I am a liberal or a conservative, or a mutt, all I know is that though I don't agree with everything here, I was immensley entertained and I think that was a huge part of the author's intention. A book, a single book, isn't going to convert a nation unless it is populated by morons, and anyone who is fanatically biased as a Conservative or Liberal could quite possibly also be a moron. But that's just me."
1,"Lies and Distortions and Ad Hominem Attacks, Oh My!","The Instigator has done it again. Another ad hominem book with no substance. He consistently distorts the truth and lies in order to push his point. If you want a ""fair and balanced"" look, don't go to a partisan such as Al Franken, just as you wouldn't go to anyone else who's only trying to raise the ire of those whom he hates. You don't go to a drug pusher for accounting help, and you don't go to a ""humorist"" like Al Franken for unbiased information and education."
1,funny or cruel?,"Al Franken claims that he is just being funny,but Ann Coultier is cruel and crazy. Free speech is for all of us.If you are going to say questionable things about people...go ahead just be able to handle the backlash.Al doesn't seem to be able to do this.He claims he is a comic and it is okay for him to say cruel things about people.If Ann Coultier does it,he claims she is crazy.The double standard does not flow well with me.His hatred of America runs rampant.It makes me see him for who he really is.A blow hard out to make a buck.I think this guy should not be given a forum until he comes up with something interesting to say.This book is a real stinker."
1,I Expected Nothing More,This book to be blunt is as pointless as he is as bad an actor/comedian. Don't waste your money.
1,Al Franken is a big fat liar: And other observations.,"What Franken is, is a stranger to the truth. What he is not, is funny. He is dull and witless unless you are so angry that anyone who says something nasty about someone you don't like releases such a flood of emotion you confuse it with being funny. Other wise, this pretender to the likes of H.L. Mencken, is a third rate hack. I gave it one star because -5 wasn't available."
1,Really Bad book,"This book is for hard core Democrats and anyone who's a fan of Bill O'Reilly is going to be bitterly disappointed. I find this book degrading to anyone who reads it, especially since it takes Bill and all his work and makes a complete mockery of it. The writer is very misinformed. It's demoralizing to even think he would do this to a self respecting man such as O'Reilly."
1,Lies & Liars,Al franken was not that good at stand up and worse at telling the truth. I was curious and tried to read it but it is more like gossip from a unhappy Liberal. Give it up Al. Look what you had to put on the cover to help you sell it. Al could not even come up with an orginal idea for the cover he had to copy one from Fox news. The book is a waste of paper!!!!!!!
1,Franken isn't funny,Al Franken is supposed to be a political satirist i guess. He's not. Dennis Miller is a political satirist!Franken just comes across as if he were spokesman for the DNC.
1,What a Piece of Garbage,Liberals - Don't be fooled by the propaganda that makes Franken out to be some kind of poster boy for the far left. His book is a collection of incendiary falsities that he had put together for one reason - to get into your pocketbooks and make a buck. He is a disgraceful person that only slanders others.
1,Hypocrite!,"Frankin suffers from ""projection"", in which he projects his own personality defects on others.His bitterness towards life in general oozes out in his writings.His writing is hypocritical in the extreme, hence it's loved by the LDS'ers..."
1,Al Fanken should stick to comedy ...,"While I enjoyed Al Franken on Saturday Night Live, albeit 20 years ago, I really wish he would have stuck to comedy. Instead of making jokes he has become a joke ... and not in a funny way. This book is nothing more than childish name calling that even a elemenatry school student knows is not constructive. You have to hand it to him. He has finally found a way to profit from the notes he used to pass in grade school. Do yourself a favor and save your money and energy by not buying a collection of insults from the class clown."
4,Entertaining politics,"I am rather conservative and I don't agree with a lot of Franken's stances, but he is a very smart, entertaining man and this books shares those qualities. This is a political book and it has an appropriate political bias, but it is accurate and makes its points through well thought out and considerate arguments, unlike many of the conservative wind bags that Franken skewers. It did not sway me on any political issues, but Franken kept me laughing throughout and certainly does an excellent job of showing how political dialog can be civil and fact based. This is a great political book for readers who do not assume the commentator who yells loudest must be correct or that anything spouted by political experts must be taken as gospel. A highly readable, entertaining and intelligent book about contemporary politics."
1,The Biggest Liar of Them All--Al Franken,"How ironic. Al Franken, who sent out false questionaires on Harvard University stationery to selected politicians asking them about their sex lives, pretending to be doing research for Harvard, is asking us to trust his judgement. I don't think so."
4,AL GIVES RIGHT WING HAWKS A TASTE OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE,"Unlike his conservative counterparts, Al is funny. Not everything in this book is a cold hard fact. That's the way it's meant to be. What Franken does is prove that the right wing pundits are not nearly as""fear and balanced"" as they claim to be. In fact, the Ann Coulter's of the world rarely every let facts get in the way of their arguments. Take this book for what it is, a liberal's rebuttal to the mud slinging campaign of the right."
3,"Good book, good facts","Armed with ""TeamFranken"", a cohort of 15 Harvard students, Al Franken goes about debunking the concept of the ""liberal"" media. I enjoyed this book tremendously - especially Al's personal description of the Paul Wellstone memorial, and the ensuing spin that that right placed on it.Keep up the good work, Al! :-)"
5,Great reading..,"I am impressed with the quality of writing and inspiration behind this book. I reread the self-esteem chapter often when I find that I am thinking against myself. Everyone can benefit from the advice that Mrs. Ross-Rodgers writes in Woman to Woman. It reinforces the importance of being happy first, of putting yourself first and watching things work out from there. It is a book I will read and continue to reread. Some lessons take longer to learn."
1,Paperback has no color illustration!,"What a disappointment! The paperback edition of Love is... by Wendy Anderson Halperin is not at all what I expected! The ""Look Inside"" link on Amazon showed lovely color pictures, but in the book I received (printed 4 days ago), interior pictures are all grey and white, and look like poorly-photocopied pages. I gave it one star for the biblical text, but I am returning this right away."
3,LOVE IS - King james version.,"LOVE is . . .is a definitive statement written in the King James bible. It is descriptive and detailed and very beautiful to read over and over again. I was happy to see it as a stand alone in a book format and looked forward to receiving it . However upon receipt I found it to be separated with a single line or verse per page, when the promotional advertisement showed the entire verse near the back of the book on one page. . .which is how I would have preferred to read it.Having ordered a number of products via Amazon with total satisfaction, I was disappointed with this one for the reasons state above."
5,Excellent mystery.,"Sawyer was acquitted in the murder trial of Cathy Anne Cranston, the daughter of a flamboyant televangelist. Though Mara Taylor felt sure Holden was innocent of the charges, someone else felt both of them were guilty, someone who was sending the rash of threatening messages, causing car ""accidents"" and littering dead bodies around them? Donna K. Smith's gripping mystery is full of bright dialogue, interesting plot twists and outrageous characters which would make the hardest of detectives blush. Parts of this book are not for the squeamish, but they are for readers who like a fine balance of romance, suspense and faith."
5,"Wow, Zaza is a melodic god","I've been a guitar fan for a long time and never have I ever seen anyone as melodic as Zaza. His compositional skills are amazing (check out i'm alright and the intro) and his technical wizardry is truly astonishing. I'm alright is still my favorite guitar song EVER, over anything of malmsteen, moore, impelliteri, gilbert, etc! becker is a close second when it comes to composition. If you like Satriani's melodicism and george bellas' techincal wizardry, this is for you!"
2,"Excellent musicianship, No taste","This album is all flash and no taste. Trust me, I enjoy some over-the-top musicianship, but this music just leaves you bored. There is no art, just chops.Admittedly, these musicians are some of the most talented that I have ever heard. If you are into that kind of thing, this is all you, buddy! Personally, I would pick up some cds from similiar bands that have both musicianship and creativity, such as Dream Theater, Liquid Tension Experiment, Joe Satriani, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Chris Poland, King Crimson, etc."
4,Like listening to a small church choir,"These are simply sung, right out of the hymnal, as you would hear them in a small church on Sunday morning. The group sounds like a small church choir of maybe 12 voices. They are not professional singers, but for the most part they did a pretty good job. Be aware that many of the songs are shortened to only two verses."
3,Uneven performances,"The performances on this CD set are uneven, but there is an awesome arrangement of Peace, Perfect Peace. It's worth downloading."
1,Don't buy,"I wasted my money on this. There is a soprano voice that is very strident, off key and does not blend with the other singers. When I read the list of songs I thought it would be great... it would be great except for the one voice that ruins it. I will never listen to this again"
5,"eclectic, challenging, tuneful, original","Here Comes Everybody are a rare find for anyone who likes melodicism and pop hooks delivered with intelligence and brash confidence. I would liken them to other hard-hitting pop/rock acts such as XTC, Quasi and the Pixies. Off-kilter, dense and brimming over with sarcastic wit and left-field subject matter, this well-produced disc will appeal to anyone interested in melodies and song concepts more challenging than any radio fare."
2,Overpriced!,"I received this book today in the mail and read it from cover to cover in about 40 minutes... Sadly, there was nothing written in this book that I didn't already know... I know gastric bypass surgery is not BRAIN surgery ... what I hoped to learn were some valuable tools in understanding myself a little better. The only thing that I truly learned from this book is that it needed a PROOFREADER before it was published. The typos throughout the book made it even harder to swallow anything the author had to say. I did like the idea that the book was written by someone who actually had the procedure but unfortunately I'm left knowing no more now than I did before I read her book. I also think that the book is ridiculously overpriced as, sadly, most of these types of books are... supply and demand, I suppose."
1,"Too Little Substance, Too Much Space","As with her other book, ""The Magic Pill,"" this book has one basic and useful premise. That insight is interesting, but not worth the price of the book. The problem is that the material for one paragraph has been turned into an entire book.Everything I've said in my review of ""The Magic Pill"" applies here. Ms. Holtzclaw would not have passed my junior English class. Moreover, as someone who has since had RNY and dealt with the issues surrounding it, I don't find her premise to be at all universally applicable. If you want one good guide to weight loss surgery, there are better choices."
5,Outstanding Preview,A thin paperback preview of what it's going to be like to be thin! This small guide changed my life.
1,"Sorry, but . . .","Save your time, save your money. This ""book"" (long pamphlet, really) was a real disappointment. The author's over simplification and smug-ness prevail. Not really a great deal of content. Some subjects demand more ""meat"" and are skimmed over. I had such great hopes for this one . . ."
1,Wrong Healers,"I ordered the MOVIE Healers with Lance Kerwin in it, not some Healing video. The wrong one was sent! The receipt even shows the Movie version on it; not the wellness ""Healing"" one, yet that's what I received."
4,This will fit a standard propane gas grill tank,"I was very skeptical about ordering this based upon the review saying that it a different gas fitting on it, but the Big Bertha Propane burner also sold here on Amazon (which is exactly the same item, but the Big Bertha model is 3 times as expensive) did not have any reviews mentioning this problem. I ordered this one and did not have any problem attaching it directly to a standard propane gas grill tank. Standard propane gas grill tanks have internal female and external male threads and this one fits the internal female threads. The only thing to remember is that it is reverse thread so you will have to thread it in counterclockwise to attach it to the tank. I have not cooked with it yet, but it did ignite using the electric start and it seemed to produce a very usable flame. I am not too worried about the electric start since you can manually light it."
2,Cheaply manfactured,I gave this burner a 2-star rating because:1. The regulator was cheaply manufactured. We went out to buy a good regulator after a few weeks.2. The burner head is poorly designed. The pan/wok sits too closed to the flame. The hottest part of a flame is the oxizing zone- slightly lower than the tip of the flame. So it does not heat up as fsst.3. The electronic ignitor is tempermental. We need to use a match to light up frequently.4. It is difficult to adjust the flame temperature because the knot does not control the heat as indicated.I will not even contemplate ordering this burner if I have known all the shortcomings. I will definitely paid more to get some thing better.
3,Does the Job!,"It works but, the Electric igniter does not work like it supose to, you still need to have a lighter available."
1,Defective Item,"The item was received in a timely manner. Unfortunately, the igniting knob on the unit would not turn to let the gas flow. I returned the item and got my money back. The service was great, but i did not get much luck with the item. I'm still debating whether to give it another chance, knowing that i can still return the item if it does not work."
1,No Description!,"Why in the world would any body purchase an item, if the item's information page does not describe weather the item is a book or a DVD? No where on any of the information does it describe what it is you may be buying. What a Joke! If it's a DVD (Movie) then say it's a damm DVD.By not saying anything we can only assume it's a Book. After reading other reviews, I discover it's not a book! Again I ask, why would anybody buy this if they do not know what there buying? No thanks for me!"
5,My 8 year old daughter and I both loved it!,"The book was on display at a local mall and it looked interesting so I bought it. I didn't think of it as a children's book, but my 8 year old bookworm daughter picked it up in the car on the way home and began reading! She was spouting an interesting fact by the minute and was fascinated with the history and lore of Halloween that she was discovering. We haven't gotten to finish the book yet, but are reading some together each night and discussing it and how we do our Halloween! Its a great collection of interesting info; I particularly like it for broadening my child's perspective, beyond our own culture and our own hybrid candy celebration."
1,Find a book that verifies its sources; this one is a bust.,"Two pages into the 1990 printing, the book speaks of Samhain, the Celtic Lord of the Dead. There was no such character in any Celtic pantheon; the word Samhain (pronounced roughly ""sah-wen"") actually means ""summer's end."" This old chestnut has been reputed extensively, something the author would do well to note as it is precisely this misinformation that has been used by many so zealots to condemn modern Halloween.With this egregious of an error in the opening pages, I have no faith that the rest of the book would hold up to scrutiny. Take a pass on this one and find a book that actually verifies its sources. Sure, the most recent edition has corrected this error, but I have little faith in the accuracy of the rest."
4,Fun read.,"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't as in depth and as scholarly as I thought it was going to be, but don't let that keep you from buying this book. It's a fun and accurate story about how Americans have had such an great holiday passed down to us. If you want a quick read that gives you a clear history about this awesome holiday this book is for you."
5,What every Halloween party-goer needs to impress&entertain!!,"Bannatyne is a researcher's dream: brimming with unusual facts about this American holiday, anyone who plans to go to or host a Halloween party (or entertain children between trick-or-treat stops!) will have plenty of interesting tidbits to impress and entertain. History buffs will LOVE the scope: how the colonists celebrated, and the Victorian-age folks, to the present. Don't miss this one, unless you want to be the only person with nothing to say at your Halloween party!"
4,Excellent primer for understanding philosophy,Without much background in philosophy selected this book to help explain to me philosophy and how philosophy can help shape our lives. Book is easy to read and understand although the questions raised are not always answerable they do make you think about mankinds existence and your own. Highly recommend this book.
5,A true critical account of History!,"This book not only presents some of the latest evidence regarding ancient India, but it also gives tremendous insight into how history itself is derived and written. A must read for any lover of India and ancient history!"
4,Excellent presentation of ground-breaking material,"The authors present their central arguments for the origins and continuity of the Indic civilization very convincingly and forcefully. This is a well written, well-documented book. This book should be required reading in high schools and colleges across India. I highly recommend this to any students of ancient history. In some sections of the book, however, the authors indulge in unwarranted rose-tinted speculation, e.g. suggesting the Vedas pre-empted modern cosmological and Darwinian theories. Aside from these deviations, the book is a very objective work of historical detective work."
1,Again Amazon deletes the one star reviews.,"Remember to always subtract 2 stars from any Amazon rating since they delete the one star ratings and allow the authors and their friends to submit multiple 5 star reviews with different IDs.My original review simply noted that genetic science has now proven the Aryan invasion theory. DNA analysis has shown that the upper caste Indians are descended from Indo-Europeans. Of course science might be considered too ""Western"" for some."
4,"Fascinating: more than speculation , less than conclusive","A fascinating read using Vedas, archeology, varied sources to make case against Aryan Invasion theory (conclusive), for very ancient continuous tradition predating Sumner (believable), and for connections between early Indus and later Ganges cultures (also believable).Until the Indus script is broken and more archeological work done in the Thar we anxiously await further proofs and revisions. Very recent under water cities that likely are about 7000 years old will add to the story when explored. Exposes racial, cultural, disciplinary biases that have held back 'progress' in better understanding early civilization and its continuity in India.This is far more than idle or imaginative speculation and well worth reading although traditional historians would appreciate more sources of evidence and may be uncomfortable with that which uses early Vedic texts."
5,The Second Edition is even better!,The second edition contains a very illuminating new introduction. It remains one of the best books on Indian civilization and its influence on the world.
4,Mind over matter?,"You might be someone who's down to earth, just like, figuring out how in someone's name some Japanese sword fighter is going to help you out in your daily life. Well, he isn't going to.What this book does teaches you is to seek within yourself and return to your own core. As I'm not someone who meditates or does much spiritual enlightment, this book still taught me a lot. As for the time of reading it, it takes you back into time and makes you think of certain things you might not have thought about all your life. So, if that's enlightment, count me in.With only 92 real pages to read, this book still gives much value for its price. Most sentences are compressed with knowledge and sometimes make you read them twice. Hey, that's 184 pages already then!Are you interested in gaining some spiritual thoughts and maybe some habits as well? Then read this book."
3,The Unfettered Mind,"Very interesting book, with great wisdom, however, being that it is a printing of actual letters from the samurai days, it is not an easy, breezy read!! You need to be in the right mood to focus and pay attention to the wisdom in it. The more you love studying Zen Buddhism and martial arts, the more you will enjoy it. But certainly not a casual read."
1,Disappointed,"Schezen's book ""Places and Memories"" is one of my favorites -- great buildings I didn't know about, shown in very original pictures. So I was quite disappointed with ""Private Architecture"" -- the same old ""greatest hits"" portrayed in somewhat sloppy photos, and all-too-briefly described with uncritical reverence."
4,Interesting Indie,"Nice production, made on a shoestring. Some great performances... especially Norman Boucher's Joey Moran and Boinski's Big Jim; and a gangster film filmed in Chicago. Good fit. A talented ensemble..."
5,Epicurus is an absolute pleasure,"Epicurus the Sage is a biting satire about the philosophical and historical climate of classical Athens. Although not at all historically accurate, it takes each character, including good old Socrates himself, to the extreme. No knowledge of philosophy or the mythology is required to get the most out of this book, although it certainly helps. It seems to take a while for the plot to kick and it winds up very quickly, which is a little disappointing. Still, it had my whole household rolling on the floor with laughter. In the tradition of Asterix, this is a great comic."
5,What a blast!,"""Jumping Jive Jazz Blocks"" lives right up to it's name! The phrases are hoppin' and great to listen to in any order. My daughter's eyes and ears perked up when we plugged this one in, and it's since become her favorite. How about a word on unit durability? I spilled some water in the block-holding sections of our unit (about a teaspoon in each), and was so disappointed when it no longer worked. But after drying it and setting it in a sunny window sill for about 4 days(minus the cartridge), it restored itself to full function! Had it required repair, Neurosmith has a policy for this type of repair and could have re-worked the unit for about 30 bucks. Good company and very helpful in customer service. I love what this toy does to little brains...so much so that I plan use it in my Occupational Therapy sessions with children of various diagnoses and ages. Good luck, and enjoy your new toy...It's well worth the money!"
5,Enticing mystery,"In the tradition of Nick Bantock, it is an artful mystery more complex than many of his other works (all of which I intend to collect). It is short and combines both the metaphysical and curious ancient artifacts from other cultures. I am taken on a journey and led to think of possible connections between the items. I am sure I will reread this work many times. Each time finding something new. It's a journey in intimate archeology. I wonder what someone would think of me if they looked through my life's souveniers?"
3,Some of the explanations of solar physics confusing,"In contrast to the other reviewers, I found some of the explanations of the physics behind solar processes rather confusing. For example, I couldn't quite understand the points made in the notes to chapter 5 about standing waves, modes and nodes. Also, the captions to the figures often don't explain what the axes of the graphs are supposed to represent."
5,From master tapes!,"Anyone who has tried to collect ""DIVINE"" on CD has found that not only do all the compliations sound terrible, but they are ALL from vinyl... EXCEPT this one...The producers of this set have actually taken the time to track down the master tapes, for everyevery single song and the results are perfection. In addition, all the mixes on this compilation are the extended versions making this worth the asking price! I highly recommend it to anyone who has been burned in the past...sets. - jw"
2,track listing wrong,"i love love love divine & was so excited to get this cd in the mail BUT to my dismay, the track listing in the description on this site is wrong. this cd DOES NOT have 'you think you're a man', 'i'm so beautiful' & 'jezabel', which is unfortunate & frustrating because these are the very tracks i bought the cd for."
3,"I ain't your Aunt Jemima and, honey, you ain't my pimp!","Divine, of course, was best known as John Waters' leading ""lady"" in several of his films. But he also had a career as a post-disco dance music diva. Sure, he couldn't sing worth a lick, but that's besides the point. He managed to be entertaining on his records by force of his personality. These songs were recorded in the 1980s, in the ""hi-NRG"" style that was popular in gay dance clubs at the time. They are fairly entertaining, with Divine spouting some ridiculous lyrics, but the musical backing tracks tend to sound pretty much the same. This is probably the best Divine CD available, if you're looking for one."
4,Hi-NRG Filth,"Like the previous reviewer I ordered this Divine compilation and was surprised when it arrived - the cover is completely different from the one previewed by Amazon. However, the track listing is the same, so you should be reasonably confident you're getting what you paid. This edition was released more than 15 years ago by Hot Productions, who released dozens of old disco albums and compilations through the 90s. Hot states that their releases are mastered from original sources, and where possible they use full 12"" or album versions. Most of the tracks on Best of Divine are full length or extended club mixes with the exception of a couple of tracks, and the sound quality is fine. This release looks like the best value and quality of the many Divine compilations available. If you're at all familiar with the work of producer Bobby O, you will know what to expect with this material; the included, later SAW productions are, for me, Divine's best material and the icing on the dog turd."
1,Absolutly dissapointing,"I have discovered Chayanne with his great album Sincero,plenty of great songs, and I'm very dissapointed with Cautivo.The uptempo songs are very poor, looks B-copies of the Estefano and Juan Mogica wonderful songs of the past.The ballads, especially the Christian Zalles one, are good, but not enough to fall in love.I hope in the next tour he don't play many of the songs of Cautivo or I will not go to the show."
1,Un disco muy triste,"A este disco de Chayanne le falta vida.No se mueve nada, parece un muermo engominado hasta las orejas y las canciones son muy pobres y poco agradecidas para tocarlas.La gente sigue pidiendo Caprichosa, quiere bailar, no quieren penas."
5,SO FAR THE BEST,"In my opinion this is one of the best cd that Chayanne had recorded the songs are catching and have something for every taste. Of course I have my favorite and is number 4 is very romantic and with a strong message.I love the whole cd and I have to listen almost everyday, it has been about 4months since I bought it and it doesn't get old. 10 stars"
1,I'm dissapointed,"I hope another kind of album, a diferent Cd of Chayanne, why he doesn't dance?, and I think the songs are worse than the others cd... anyway, I'll wait for the next cd he comes back to his great Grammy Award Nominee days as Sincero."
1,este disco si que no,"es una pena que el anterior disco sea tan bueno y este no, yo me esperaba otros temas , no estos, además casi no baila, le hace falta mejores temas pegadizos y que se bailen sin forzar."
3,"Definatly, NOT as good as the others!","Hi!!! Well, I was very disappointed with this book. This series is not what it used to be! Before, the books would be "" can't put it down "" and now, it's like..... "" put me down.... NOW!"" cause, there so boring. I LOVE horses, and I just got my own horse about a week ago!!!"
3,A Fair Book,"Star's Chance was a fairy good book, slow at first but it picked up at the end. Personally I think Christina needs a serious additude adjustment. She turning into one of those snobby rich horse kids that everyone hates. You know I agree about the series going down hill and all but I also think we owe the new authers a bit of credit because after all they are trying ard to please us. One of the things I didn't like about this book was that Cristina took Star on an overnight ride when in the begining she was going on about how unconditoned he was. Thats my thoughts on star's chance"
1,"This series was good, but now it's rubbish.","I used to like the Thoroughbred series. I was quite obsessed with it, they were my favourite books. But after about book 20, the quality started to slide. The series has become too commercial, and the books themselves have suffered. They have from having too many characters and too many authors, which makes the biggest problem inconsistentcy. There are so many discrepancies in the books that I don't know what is happening. None of the new authors seem to have read the previous books, and with so many charaters, none of them are getting a fair chance and it's very difficult to keep them all straight in your mind and remeber who is who. I also think that some of the characters' motives are a bit questionable, particularly Christina. The girl needs a bit of constancy. I thought Sterling was supposed to be the horse of her dreams? And I was disgusted with the ""Ashleigh"" series. Over all, I am very disappointed and no longer consider these books worth reading."
2,An ok book,"ALright...well, I have been reading the T-Bred books ever since they first came out. Joanna Campbell was awesome as the writer...I couldn't wait to get on to the next book. But the series has been going down hill...and right now I have no motivation to read them anymore. Characters just are not as developed as they used to be...and I mean both human and equine. Star's Chance was a good book...as they all were...but I have pretty much given up on any hope that they will be as good as they used to. Sorry...but that is my opinion."
3,Okay,"I have enjoyed all the Thoroughbred books so far, excypt for this one. It was very boring and it took forever to end. I usually finish a Thoroughbred book in a day, but this one took me at least two weeks. I'm tired of everything always working out for the characters. The books have become very predictable. Like when you read this you know what is going to happen to Star(which I won't reveal). I'm really glad the next book was on Cindy. That book was wonderful, but do recommend to read this book if you keep up with the series only so in the future books you will understand what is going on!"
5,Another Awsome Book To Add To My collection.,"I think the seires has gone a bit down hill since Joanna stopped writing but, the writers are still coming up with books that the readers want to read. their recent plot lines have been excellent and I hope they keep them up. I do wish they would talk about some of the other horses that were racing and retired a generation before, like Honor and Champion. The Ashleigh books were great until some else took over them. They have gone downhill, however, alot of people don't realize how hard it must be for those other writeers to try and fill Joanna's shoes. She set the tone for an awsome seires and if she's reading this, I would like her to know she did an awsome job with the seires. I also wish her well in her life and hope she will have a long and happy one. This book sounds really great and I hope all of u out there who love the Thoroughbred seires will continue to read and support it 100%. Thanx"
1,Not for Mac,"When I ordered this product before Thanksgiving, your description indicated Apple compatibility. I am glad to see that you've changed your blurb because it was incorrect. It does NOT work for Apple products. (I called Webroot to verify.) We Mac users need Macwasher."
5,Pastor Hinn has expressed his desires to depart from TBN!,"This Bible contains lots of great essays by on Faith Alone by Martin Luther and Chas. Spurgeon and George Whitefield. It does not say that Jesus became sin itself on the Cross. This Bible is fundamentally theologically no worse than The Bible Answerman and CRI. Hank and Benny are both Arminians alike.There is no Crouch, Schuller, Robertson, or Copland in here.Gold Dust and Manna are dime-store majic tricks. Never give money to someone who doesn't need money.1 Samuel 2:36 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread."
1,"Great Game, Horrible Product","I bought this set for my husband's birthday because we love playing when we visit my parents. We could not have been more disappointed. The shape and size of the the dominoes are not uniform. Those with more dots seem to be thinner than those with less. Knowing this, there was definitely an advantage in the game. Also, several tiles were marked up and could not be washed off. Once we knew the value of those tiles, the integrity was again compromised. On top of all this, the tin was completely smashed when we received it."
2,Great Dominoes - Train not so great,"The dominoes in this set are excellent, but the features that make it Mexican Train are very poor. The centerpiece is just a piece of cardboard, and does not make sound effects like other sets. Also, only 4 trains are included. The metal box is fine, but is not a carrying case with a handle like other sets. The directions for the game were written by a person who does not speak English well, and the rules are ambiguous. I am going to buy a different set because this one is a disappointment."
3,Cheap domino set,"I bought this set because it is the same manufacturer as my cousin's set. Her set is a little bit older and MUCH nicer, however. These are large thick pieces of plastic, but not as heavy or glossy as the other set by Cardinal . The colors are bright, but color is smeared across quite a few of the faces and there are some marks that won't come off of the backs of several tiles. Tin is handy but very easily dented.It is a good basic set.I rated this as somewhat educational because there is strategy throughout and counting at the end."
3,Poor Quality Control,"Several of the pieces have flaws which make them stand out so everyone knows what you have and what you are picking. Big splotch of purple on the back of the double 9, hole in the finish on the back of the 12/10... the price was right, but I'd go with a different brand if you are into dominoes or at all competitive."
3,Not the best quality,"When the dominos finally arrived and I was able to examine them, I quickly relized the quality of the dominos was C or B grade. Some of the dots are not painted in all the way. The dominos are chipped in some areas. The dominos themselves are not a bright white. The dominos a bit thinner than what I thought they would be and need a domino tray in order to stand them on their sides; otherwise they easily fall over if someone lightly bumps the table. The dominos aren't bad, but they are not an A grade quality."
2,Game Essentials Double Twelve Color Dot Dominoes with Mexican Train (Purchased on 02/06/2009),The Quality is OK but not great--tiles are thin (tip easily) and the metal box containing them was all dented because the shipping packaging was completely inadequate to protect the metal container. The tiles seem roughly made.
2,Crooked 11s,"The game itself: fun, great for all ages that can count, and even for all languages, when not everyone present can speak English.However, the low rating is due to this particular set I purchased, which lacked in quality. The black center line was smeared on a few pieces. And the dots on the 11s were crooked in the center line on a few pieces.I suggest getting the Mexican Train Dominoes with Electric Choo Choo Train by Puremco. I purchased this set as well, and it was perfect."
1,"Great game but once again, lousy QC","I bought this to take to the beach for my niece and nephew, so I just wanted something cheap and compact. Still, it's disappointing that the quality control is so poor. I opened the tin to find the dominos in dusty, shrink-wrapped sets. The upper-half numbers are noticeably thinker than the lower-half. And after seeing so many complaints about missing bones, I went through the entire set and found one missing while another was duplicated. That's 20 minutes of my life I'd like back, thank you, and my time is probably worth a lot more than the amount I saved! But I'm not about to spend even more time returning them. I just won't buy anything from Cardinal again."
4,Differentiated lesson,I am a First Grade teacher and I used these dominoes to teach fact families. It was wonderful for the kids who needed a bigger challenge as it offered higher numbers to use. The kids loved using them and it really added to my differentiated instruction.
1,Poor quality,"The colored dots started coming off almost immediately.Two dominos lost some dots first few days, others arestarting to come of later."
4,Mexican dominoes,The game is alot of fun but we realized after the third game we had a double dominoe of the same.According to the directions you should have only one tile of each domino. I was very disaapointed since this game was a gift to my daughter.
2,Quality of product,"This product arrived with a duplicate tile and one missing tile. Also, the train section had one piece broken off. The quality control is not very efficient. I had to return this product."
4,Great first set of Dominoes,I purchased these for my nine year old son for Christmas this year. They are a great starter set and we have absolutely no complaints. The tiles appear to be well made and the tin was in great shape.
5,Best Family Game,"The Double 12 Tin of Dominoes by Cardinal Industries is the ultimate all-ages game. Perfect for families or multi-generational gatherings on cold winter afternoons. I enjoy playing 'Chicken-foot' with my grandchildren, or the next-door neighbors - anyone can enjoy the game. The dominoes are solid, sturdy, washable and brightly colored. We love 'em!"
3,dots vs numbered ones,"I purchased the Double 12's so more friends could play on one table. Should you want to get anything above the Double 9's get the numbered the ones. The Double 12's that have dots are much too difficult to see and read at night. Again get the numbered ones, your friends will love the game much better."
4,Mexican Dominoes,I first played this game at a friends' home with 5 other people. The game is a lot of fun and you really have to think and strategize as to your best next move and there is usually more than one move you can make so you have to think the move thru! Fun game.
4,Great for Mexican Train,"The bright colors are great, but don't get them wet or you'll loose the little color dots on the tiles."
1,Angie,"I ordered this product because my sister told me about getting it on this site. I was REALLY disappointed. The tin was dented when I received it but I could deal with that, what I couldn't deal with was that many dominoes were missing and there were duplicates of some of the dominoes. When I called customer service they were not surprised as there had been other problems with this product. I have returned the product and I am waiting for credit. Customer service was very nice in handling this!"
3,"Good ""Common/Everyday"" Set","These dominoes are plastic and sturdy, so would be good for a family that loves to play. That being said, I was a little disappointed in how they arrived. They were scuffed and marred, and required cleaning to make them look more uniform with each other. They are still not 100% clean of these defects, but we enjoy playing nonetheless. Great as a common/every day set!"
1,Incomplete set!,"Love playing dominoes so I bought my own set. Sadly, this set is missing some dominoes and has duplicates of others. Boo! Two thumbs down."
1,Poor quality,"I ordered this for a gift, and was extremely disappointed in the condition, and quality of this product. The dominoes were varying shades of white to off-white to dirty/stained. The coloring of the dots was not nearly as vivid as shown, and some colors muted, dull, and smeared. Just one of the worst products I have ever received from Amazon. I honestly was hoping to order more sets for gifts, or ourselves, but not this brand!"
4,Wow!!!,My wife and I had played Mexican Train Dominoes only a few times before we went out and bought this set. It's fantastic! So much fun!
2,Dominos,"I specifically purchased these particular dominos based on the photo in the ad. I play dominos with others and was attempting to have a set that used the same colors for the different numbers. When I opened the box, the colors were not what was shown in the ad. So they are still not what I want....too much of a hassle to send them back so I will use them at camp."
4,Great size and sits flat on ceramic stoves.,Nice pot for the price. Heavy weight and sits flat on burners. Would purchase again.
2,Bad copper coating!,"The pan itself is okay, if not outstanding--primarily because the stainless steel is thinner than previously. However, the ""copper clad"" bottom, after only one use and washing, is now almost gone. That is poor quality for a name-brand utensil!"
5,Revere Traditions saucepan---GREAT,Best saucepan I have ever owned. Nice size--easy to clean. GREAT ITEM.Thanks.
2,An uneasy mix of fact and fiction,"This book is described as ""creative non-fiction,"" an uneasy mix of fact and fiction and a concept that makes me uncomfortable. In reading this book, it's impossible to know which ""facts"" are really facts and which are fiction. The author's descriptions are obviously fictionalized (no one kept that kind of detailed records of the thoughts and actions of characters) although the historical events are factual.It ends up having too much of a textbook quality for a novel, but too ""creative"" for a history book. Good history writers have shown that it's possible to craft an interesting non-fiction book without injecting pure fiction and speculation.The sad thing is that the historical story of these ""bride ships"" IS fascinating. However, the format chosen for this book makes it less than satisfying."
2,Awful,"Relies to heavily on a thin plot...characters are shallow...very little payoff and little reason for me to waste time reading 200+ pages. Beware of Johnson's secret communist agenda...I actually know this guy. Johnson, you better take a long voyage of hope because I doubt your book is going to top book lists anytime soon."
3,Beethoven - Symphonies (DVD Audio) ~ Barenboim,"I bought all of the Beethoven Symphonies by Barenboim (DVD Audio) except for the Eroica. All sound quite good (spacious, clean, and well performed) except for one thing that really bothers me; I hear absolutely no signal coming from my subwoofer when playing these discs. I know that my equipment is connected properly because when I play my other DVD audio discs, this problem does not occur. I have read the other reviews regarding these discs and no mention was made of this problem. I am not asking for overwhelming low-end, but some would be appreciated. Has anyone else out there experienced this problem from these discs?"
3,Beethoven - Symphonies (DVD Audio) ~ Barenboim,"Please disregard this review if it is a duplicate. I hear absolutely no sound coming from the low frequency channel on this Beethoven/Barenboim DVD-A nor do I hear it on the other discs in the series. Otherwise, the sound is very good and the performance by Barenboim and the orchestra are very good. I do not experience this problem with any of my other DVD-A discs regardless of genre. I have a DVD-Audio player and a DVD-Audio compatible receiver properly connected and configured for DVD-Audio playback."
4,Very useful and clear,"In my opinion this book remains one the best written on the field.In fact, it deals with the important topics in an elegant way. The first part is dedicated to the basic termodinamical concepts. This part just needs a little mathematical background but i must say in some ocasions it can become boring (just a little). Once you have red this part wich deals comes (in the middle of the book) the introduction of quantum mechanics. I feel the autor has reached his purprose of telling you the essential without complicating things. To my mind,really well done!!. just say i don't find enough information about group theory ( it is necesary to know a lot of it when you have reached an intermidiate-advanced level in quantum mechanics), but this must be forgiven for the book is intended for undergraduate students essentially."
3,"Great idea for open area, but did not work for me","I do like this product, but it was not really for my use. I have my closet full, so there is no space for this type of Tie Rack. I guess I needed something flat instead.But even I haven't use the tie racks I bought, one of them fall apart, I'm not sure how long it will last if I use it."
4,This Octagenarian can write,"Martha Blum wrote this at age 86 and it's her first novel. THere's more to this accomplishment.This book won the Saskatchewan Book Award for First Novel and was nominated for Libris Awards, and a 2000 shortlist for the Canadian Booksellers Association.Of the books I read in 2000, this rates as definitely one of my favourites. It's rich, detailed, deeply insightful, beautifully written. She transports readers to Prague and back -- theatre for the mind. It's a rich story of deep and enduring love, search for oneself, and the horrors of the Halocaust. Her detail is unsparing.The only negative, is that I feel this novel seems to be near-autobiography. She may not write another one as powerful as this. I must read this book again -- you should read it at least once."
5,Best songs Album,The songs are very rhythmic and dance able.This collection of Herman's hermits hits is great and happy and some a little mellow.A classic treasure of their music and times.
4,"padded, but still worthwhile","Undeniably catchy pop, this collection delivers what you want, then rather overstays its welcome, with the mediocre additions prolonging and dulling the experience. But once the chaff is cleared away, some great stuff here: I now realize it's Henery the VIII, not Henry, and that the song is basically one verse with repeats, but so what? I was anxious to have their version of ""Silhouettes"", even though a closer listen now reveals a song sung by an [poor singer] (I skip over ""What a Wonderful World"" for that reason). Probably the biggest revelation for me was the should-have-been-a-bigger-hit ""No Milk Today"" - really an excellent pop tune, with no weak spots."
3,Searching for cd/album,"I'm looking for that album that contained songs like ""I Understand"", ""Sea Cruise"", ""I'm Into Something Good"", etc. It is a Parlophone issue. Is it available on CD? Inform me through my e-mail address."
3,Decent,"I amit Hermens Hermets have some good songs like there,s a kind of hush and something tells me. But the best band from the uk and America and I am an American the Beatles are simply the best band ever. I love contempory Christian praise and worship. Yes I am A Christian and this music is decnet so much better than today,s Heavy Metal. GodBless"
1,NOT AS NEW!!,"The seller wrote that the book is as new, but when i get the book it was marked in almost all pages and with different colors..it looks like the one who used it was studying hardly on it!!!!I'm upset of the book , and i even did not study from it since i received it couple of weeks ago, because - for me - its not encouraging to study from a book highly marked .."
3,MONEY KEEPS GETTING WORST!!,"I have used Money since 1998 and never had any complaints until this version. I never use the online functions because of the wrong information downloaded and the constant freezing of the software when working with the online features turned on.I have learned to be very careful about logging in offline to avoid the online problems and offline the software works fine. I have refused to upgrade from 2006 despite the continued warnings that my online privileges have expired because there is no upside to running this program with the online features working.From the reviews that Money 2008, I gather that things have only grown worst so I will continue to use this version without the online features."
5,mad hatter's tea cozy,"Absolutely fabulous, very nice and large, and a gorgeous fabric, topped with a precious bow. I. Recommend this one highly!"
3,He's not Jack Fleming,"I've enjoyed the Jack Fleming series and Jonathan Barrett stories. I like the way her heros just happen to be vampires. This book she didn't stay true to the way she has written her other vampires, it felt more disjointed. I would have liked more history of the characters of Sabra and her knight. Ms. Elrod's characters usually flow better, I may have liked it better if I wasn't comparing to her other books."
2,Forever Knight the novel!,"It's pretty much an episode of Forever Knight. We start back in the middle ages when Richard is made into a vampire and face forward to modern day in the city of Toronto, Canada (best city in the world by the by) and Richard is a security specialist helping to protect Canada's Prime Minister.My problems with this book are:1) Unrealistic characters/dialogue.2) The IRA terror plot is outdated.3) The vampire is too human and too weak.4) Not dark enough for a vampire novel.Still, I like PN Elrod and they can't all be keepers (excuse the pun) but I can't recommend buying a new copy. Get it used."
1,Please don't bother.,"If you're a die-hard FK or Elrod completist/collector, then by all means buy the book. But if you're looking for interesting characters, compelling plot, or a decent book, don't bother. Dull protagonist, utterly annoying and tiresome villain, gratuitous sex scenes, and a let-down ending did not add to a happy time for this reader. Definitely not what I expected of such renowned folks."
3,It was cool,Nigel Bennette who played a vampire named Lucien LaCroix on Forever Knight is also the main charecter in this book. The likeness of the two are EXACTLY the same.
1,What happened?,I'm a fan of Nigel Bennett--when he's on TV--and a big fan of P. N. Elrod's--except for this book. The plot elements are so disparate that it's hard to believe that even Elrod could make a good vampire novel out of them; it ranges from Celtic mysticism to Camelot to some wierd tribute to I Heard the Owl Call My Name to modern-day Toronto. The small portions set in Kingcome Inlet are so bad it's embarassing; the rest of the book is so far below Ms. Elrod's usual fine writing that I'm tempted to blame it on Mr. Bennett. But a tight deadline and loose editing are likely the real culprits.
2,MEH,"I wanted to like this book. I like the cover. I LOVED LaCroix in Forever Knight. But. The book seems surprisingly lame. i can't put my finger on it, exactly..... I guess I would describe it as facile. As an avid reader, and fan of the genre, it just didn't grab me. In fact I put it aside and never finished it."
1,It was Elephant?,"A friend gave me this book for Christmas. I couldn't believe what I read. What happen to editing! I've read some poor written stuff on the the Internet, but this took the cake! And this was published by the same company that publishes my favorite MAN-KZIN WARS series. To paraphase a line from the story. I've read some moronic stories but is was ELEPHANT!"
3,Not as good as previous versions.,"I used to like this product. It is still a good vitamin C, I think. But this batch does not completely dissolve in water. There is a significant amount that does not so you have to remember to continuously shake your glass to be able to drink the supplement."
4,fun and versatile,"Personally I think it is nice to make homemade cards for friends and family, with the price of cards today this is a plus. Also I can personalize the card and change it to what I want to say. I am having alot of fun with this program. It has a built in address book and calendar and a reminder so I will never forget another birthday or whatever. Then there is the card just for fun because I am thinking of someone. I have not had any of the problems that I read in the other review and I really like this product for the price. I am totally satisfied."
1,"Frustrating, condescending and inflexible","Not only does this product insist on printing a cheesy label on the back of every card to assure people that, yes indeed, it's a homemade computer card, but it hijacks your computer and printer when it's time to print. It forces--and I mean forces--you to endure a paper-wasting printer process to determine the best way to print your card. It's only mildly annoying the first time. It's infuriating subsequent times, when there is no way to tell it that you have already printed with this program on this printer and you don't want to kill more trees. Hallmark can and should do better."
1,Where is the Event Planner?,"The product I got was in a different wrapping then the picture and although it says it has an Event Planner it isn't there. The user guide says there is a button for it, yet it doesn't exist. I've tried re-installing it figuring I might have missed something on the install, but it is still missing the Event Planner. The sole reason I purchased this product was to replace my Create-A-Card that had the Event Planner because I was told this works on Windows 7 and my really old software doesn't.... I've contacted Hallmark about this and am waiting to hear back.. as of right now, I'd say the version 1stVideo is selling now doesn't seem to have Event Planner!!! I'm more than disappointed!!"
3,Not one of the best I've seen,"I generally enjoy reading this series of books to my young daughter. But when reading Just Me and My Babysitter, I was not pleased to see the disobedience and disrespect of the main character in the book. I know that it is meant to be cute, but my child is a great imitator and these are not the things I would want her to be doing. I bought the book not knowing what the content was and was very disappointed."
5,great for equestrians,"I am an equestrian and often have to horse show in hot weather. This bra fits perfectly on my narrow frame, keeping everything in place with no chafing or riding up. I've tried every sports bra out there and this one fits well enough to wear every day. Excellent!"
3,Not well designed,"ConsWhen trying on for first time I loosened all the straps and put on but the stitching between the breasts ripped a little. Seems like this should be reinforced.A little tight on the cup size but should be ok since I am losing weight.When I wore during workout for first time it was so tight that I had to slow down. Since wearing 3x, has gotten better.Don't like the color but there were not many choices.Good price for the size. It is very hard to find bigger sized sports bras with good support. This is like wearing a regular bra and no uni-boob."
2,To Bulky,"This style was so high that it was hard to get the straps up. Sent it back. If you want armor, this would work"
4,I had to get used to it,"This is the first time I have found a bra that fits, holds me up and improves my posture. There is no uncomfortable underwire either! Though a little scratchy at first, after a few washings, the 3 I purchased are softening."
4,Good support,"I like this bra, it has enough support to keep the jiggle under control & fits pretty well. I left off one star because it's almost too short in the straps. I am tall, so would have liked to lengthen them a little more, but ran out of strap. But, it's ok, I'm sure in time it will loosen up at least a little."
1,Return to sender,"The bra was itchy, not at all supportive and gave my top a weird shape. The decision to send it back was pretty clear-cut."
3,"okay, but not a no bounch bra","I wear a 38 F and based on the glowing reviews, I thought I'd give this bra a try. We can all agree that it's near impossible to find a comfortable sports bra for busty ladies & sadly, this ain't it. It's just okay. This brad does NOT allow me to jog, but it's fine for weights or riding my bike. You will have torpedo tits, so I would not wear this to the office. Workout yes, for the day, not for me.I agree with the other ladies in terms of sizing. I did buy my normal size , and while it's a sung fit (as designed for a sports bra) the comfort factor is fine. Material softens up a bit. You should wash this & all bra's in cold water with a cold rinse and air dry. I will keep this one and continue my quest for a no bounce model.Happy Bra hunting ladies!"
4,Great Quality Bra,"Great details and fabric. I ordered the bra in the size I normally buy, but should have ordered a larger size. This is tight on the rib cage. I actually need a two inch extension for comfort."
2,Not for me,"Pros: Liked the back. Seems sturdy strong material.Cons: Runs a bit small, Not enough separation between the cups.This bra caught my attention because of the back. I have to alter my bras in the back so the straps come closer to the center. Because I need sturdy bras T-back bras aren't enough support. I'm returning because the front cups squeeze the girls together instead of lift and separate. It runs slightly small in the band size."
2,"Ow, the shoulder straps","I had difficulty determining the size to get, and I must had got it wrong. On the negative side, the cups are smaller than expected, and this is the first bra I've ever had that the shoulder straps dig in, even buying additional padding isn't helping. On the plus side, wow, there is NO bounce! I may try this item again, but in a size up both cup and band. Oh, and there was the unexpected bill from fedex for additional customs fees etc. I didn't check into customs ahead of time, so my fault, but now, not the great deal it seemed to be."
4,Glamorised Full Figure Sports Bra,"This bra offers overall good support, and comfortable enough to be used as a normal daily bra. But it's not really for high impact endurance sports."
3,Great support but a little scratchy,"The bra is very supportive and works just like the product description says it will. It is comfortable and suportive. I however am having problems with the hooks, they are difficult at time. Also the material used is rather scratchy."
2,Uncomfortable,I purchased this bra with the hopes of support with less constriction. What I got was a 1940's straight-jacket type brazier. Definately not what was advertised on multiple sites.
2,Returned bra,"This bra ended up being too uncomfortable, and just didn't have enough support. Seemed that it didn't quite live up to it's description. I did return the bra, and got a prompt refund."
2,Not what I expected,Looking at the picture and description I thought this bra would be a lot more solid. I ended up returning it. There was no coverage (ie nipple coverage) no under-wire and the cups were droopy. For such a weakly designed bra it sure is big and ugly. I need support not extra material!
1,"Glamorise Women's full-figure sports bra, 40D",I purchase this item based on manifacturer's sizing specification and it turned out to be too big. The design quality is OK.
2,some of these reviews must be fake!,"Anybody else suspicious that there are SO MANY reviews about bras? My guess is that the manufacturers are in a war to fake the most positive reviews and are also dissing the competition's products. Anyway, this bra, like so sports bras, won't help full-figured women to minimize bounce. It is lightweight and will help reduce sweating becuse the cups are separated, but it does nothing to minimize movement -- which is a key factor in a sports bra for full-figured women."
2,Glamorise Full Figure Sports bra,"You would think when it says Full Figure it would be supportive. Well, this bra is not the one for you if you are over a (D) cup.Keep Looking."
1,So disappoointed,"I wanted to love this bra and ordered according to the sizing instructions on this bra. What I got was a bra in my band size that was a band size too small. And I ordered down a cup size, as instructed, and that was too small too. Utter failure. I'm hoping that if I eventually lose weight, I'll be able to wear it, but for now, it's a no go for me."
2,didn't fit,I ordered this in 34DD which is the size I usually wear. It was much too big in the cups and fuller coverage than I was expecting.
4,Can't Complain,"I was satisfied with the structure and support of this bra~It's a little tighter than the size should be and I wished it had the modesty petals in it or at least some sort of lining. You can't tell by the picture and they don't specify whether it has it or not, so it would be nice it was noted in the info. I don't like anything ""shining out"" from my shirts."
5,Great bra for bigger sizes,"I used to use the ShockAsorb Level 4 Sports bra, but when I saw this bra for almost half the price, I said ""why not"". I was pleasantly surprised. This bra is as supportive and MORE comfortable than the ShockAsorb was, and its cheaper! I can even see wearing this on a lazy day.The padding is great, the cups fit perfectly, and the band is tight, but not uncomfortable (like it should be). The best part is, NO BOUNCE! This bra is wonderfully supportive, and just comes to prove that you don't always need to spend 50 bucks to get a great product."
1,extremely uncomfortable,This is one of THE most uncomfortable bras I have EVER worn. The band below the breasts rolled immediately. I made the mistake of wearing it to work and it drove me insane. I really would not even give it one star because in addition to it being uncomfortable it shapes your breasts like cones. Pointy cones.
3,"Great bra, but....","This bra really does a great job, I have a large bust and needed something that would reduce bounce. This bra is great for that, but my complaint is comfort. The straps are scratchy and rub where they are stitched on the shoulders, and there are sharp metal clips for adjusting the strap length that cut into the back of my shoulders. So, by the end of the day I cannot wait to get this bra off!"
2,Not very supportive,"Although I usually wear Glamorize bras, this one is light-weight and not at all supportive of my 36C figure. Quite disappointing, actually"
5,Back and shoulder saver,This bra is not only great for workouts but can be worn daily for added back and shoulder support. I ordered one to try and will be placing another order for 5 more. Great product!
3,Fits well but I don't like the shaping,"I was hoping this was more of a rounded cup bra like the picture indicates, but it still has that weird point shaping that is ludicrous in this size (38G). The fabric is very dense and supportive and I will definitely wear it for my high impact activities."
3,Runs small,"I orderd a 36 E. It runs small but since I am working out to lose weight i will keep it in the hopes the fit gets better. It is somewhat itchy also. There is very little ""give"" so it should work well to keep the ""girls"" in place."
4,Good bra at a decent price,"I have worn this twice so far. It was scratchy putting it on at first, but not while wearing it. It fits well and is comfortable. It is supportive and does not allow much bounce. I did read several places that for sports bras you should order down a cup size and up a band size. I did this and it fits well. Overall at this point it is a good bra."
1,A most uncomfortable bra,"This is my first Glamorize bra and I will never buy another. There is something in the cup that rubs and irritates. It is Horrible! Unfortunately, I wore it walking before I discovered my mistake. DO NOT BUY THIS BRA."
4,Glamorise Women's MagicLift Active Support Bra,"This is my first Glamorise bra and I love it. I was looking for a comfortable alternative to an underwired bra that also provided great support and this bra does the trick. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I used the used the size calculator on the Glamorise site and, although I thought the size it suggested was rather large (2 sizes larger than I usually purchase), I ordered exactly what their calculator suggested. I have to use the tightest set of hooks and the cup size does not fit snuggly, leaving a small fold of extra fabric which shows through tee shirts. Next time I will order a smaller size."
1,does not have a good body contour,The material used for cups is very thin. Does not provide the support and the material irritates skin a lot.
1,Not what expecting,"I selected this rating because this Sports Bra was not what I was expecting at all. This was an extremely uncomfortable product and the fabric felt like sandpaper -- it was very abrasive. I'm not sure that it would not have caused intense chafing if I had done more than tried it on. The construction also involves elastic on the edge between the ""wing"" and the bra strap which created an obvious puckering of the fabric, even when being worn. The puckering showed through to my shirt. I probably could have ignored that unattrative effect if I hadn't had the sanding sensation. Since some of the fabric was reminiscent of window screen mesh, I am sure that all of the wicking properties were as stated. There were some aspects of the over-all construction that seemed like they would be beneficial -- such as some supportive padding at the base of each cup."
2,felt smaller than a whole cup size smaller!,"i normally wear this brand snd style size 36d, i ordered a dd cup but found it to be smaller than my 36d.dont know if the company restyled it or what buti was dissapointed it did not fit."
4,Not bad for a sports bra,"Being of a larger bra size, finding a decent sports bra is a challenge. This item gives good support. The only reason I didn't give it a five star is that I have a short torso and thus the bottom band tends to ""roll"" up. But over-all it provides good support."
1,eh..,"this bra is ill fitting & has a very odd shape. Control of movement is amost non existent. I have to wear this over my regular bra. ive been fitted several times, so I kow I chose the correct size. The cup doesnt fully hold the breast in. I have spillage on the top, which is why I wear my reg bra underneath."
3,Cone shaped cups!,"This bra would have been a perfect fit and a welcome addition were it not for the complete pointy-shaped cups. This left about 1/4"" of a wrinkle in the bra for me that was just a no-go, so I had to return it. The features on the bra are great and I could see how it could really provide support without an underwire.The shape of the cups were just a little too strange for me and didn't work. Was really hoping this one would have worked. I guess I will stick with my Moving Comfort brand which seem to provide a more solid fit."
3,Sized right but strange shapped cups,This bra was very supportive and was true to size but the cups created a strange shape that I could not live with. This bra had minimal elastic and provided very firm support if you can live with the strange shape.
4,Comfort at last!,I've had luck with almost all of the Glamorise bras. I was relieved to have the weight of the girls more evenly distributed. My shoulders felt better immediately.
3,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,"I have to say first I was amazed how quickly I received the bra. I am a 42F and it is hard to find good supportive bras in this size. I put it on and it was nice and tight, so I doubt that it'll stretch out too easily over time, the size was perfect. The shape and support are amazing. However, after 4 hours of wearing the bra just around the house, I had to take it off because it felt like I was being chaffed to death- like little plastic nubs were jabbing my skin. The nylon mesh around the back is murder. I am so happy with the support however I'm going to wear a cami underneath it.I probably won't buy another one unless they change the material or add a liner to the bra. So what good is a supportive bra if you can't wear it? I think if I had worn it any longer I would have started bleeding."
1,AWFUL!,"I had high hopes for this bra -- boy was I disappointed. A lot of other reviewers mention that it makes your breasts cone shaped, and it certainly does. Very strange shape to the cups on this bra. Another reviewer described this as a ""bulletproof vest,"" which she thought was a good thing - I do NOT. The bulletproof vest analogy is a good one, because the material has no give whatsoever. It was extremely uncomfortable."
2,Scratchy!,"I purchased this bra because I thought from the description that it would be really comfortable, but the fabric was so scratchy I couldn't imagine exercising in it. The design was good, the execution terrible."
3,not perfect,"this bra does give good support. however, i had to use a scissors to cut out some of sharp sewn stiches on the back strap of the bra. The bra sizing is smaller - I am a 42 F, and I had to use the last row of hooks instead of the first row like my other bras. The straps while broad are short. I have a short torso, and even I had to have the straps fully extended, and hooking up the bra almost caused me to twist off my own arms!"
3,hold you in but is scratchy,"This bra holds you in and you get very minimal bouce, but the material is really scratchy and not real comfortable. I have a front closure bra that Glamorise makes that is much more comfortable."
5,"Flattering...not a ""Uni-boob""","I wear a 36G or H, and in this bra I wear a G. It gives me medium support, and I'll wear it for light activity and everyday wear. It gives me shape, unlike most sports bras, and I can wear it under tee shirts! I just ordered another."
2,irregular shape,i dont like the way this bra shapes your brests and it does not have good support. i am unhappy with this purchase.
5,love this bra,glamorise bra -i love the fit and comfort of this bra-the 5 hooks keep it in place. i would recommend this bra for anyone whose looking for comfort
1,Poor Quality,"Review from my wife:The detail intended to be an inner sling is cut bigger than the outer cup of the bra. Not only it doesn't provide any additional support but wrinkles inside and irritates badly. I am not sure whether it is a design or manufacturing problem, but the result is extremely uncomfortable anyway. So back it goes."
5,Great bra!,"Love how this sports bra keeps me lifted and separated. I'm in the military and wear sports bras under my uniform, but could never find anything comfortable as I'm a a 36 G. I am so glad I found this brand and I am able to wear sports bras that fit instead of 2 or 3 at the same time that are meant for D cups and below, just to get the support I need.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sports bra with larger cup sizes!!"
4,NOT BAD FIT,Its hard to find a sports bra for a 40G. Its a decent fit. I cant really do any running or jogging in it. But low impact activities are fine. Doesnt hurt or pinch. Pretty true to size.
4,"Very supportive, but a bit of 'smooshing'","I bought this bra for very intensive zumba classes and dance training. I am a 34F - so I need it to be a worker. The bra provided great support in class and minimized bouncing, which were the most important features I was after. The cup spacing, however, is a bit close and although the cups are seperate, underneath a top it creates that 'boob shelf' effect that I'm not a big fan of. Hence 4 stars instead of 5. But overall I am happy with the product."
2,sized at random?,I bought two. I have had this brand bra in the past and was sure of the size I needed. One of the bras fits but it tight. The other is so tight I can only wear it for an hour at a time. The material on the seams and straps is rough and irritates my skin. Won't be buying this brand again
4,Runners High,"I went running with my new bra on and forgot that I was test driving it! I had been wearing the same style and brand for over 20 years. It is no longer sold. I am a 34DDD when slimmer and a little bigger when I gain a few pounds. Super hard to find a sports bra that fits and keeps the girls static. Yippee! This bra not only does the trick, I like it for everyday. I finally threw away my old running bra with the duct taped straps! Thank you, Glamorise!"
2,Sizing runs small,"Looked like maybe a nice bra, but the sizing runs small. Can't wear it right now, too little. As I said though, it looks like a nice bra."
4,Great Support!,I love this bra for support and the fact that I dont have a uniboob when I wear it. However the fabric is a little itchy. That is my only complaint!
5,"Amazing Support,not just for sports!","I purchased this for my daughter,who at the age of 19 was having back pain given the size of her breasts. This bra has eliminated her pain, makes her figure look fantastic and subsequently improved her posture. She is not interested in wearing others. I ended up buying four."
1,keep looking!,"This is not the sports bra you're looking for...the band is smaller than the sizing would indicate, and the cups/straps offer no support. I have yet to find a sports bra in my true size that actually holds my chest the way a sports bra should - for activity."
1,Do not buy this!,"First off it makes your boobs look cone-like but I figured what the heck I'm just using it as a sports bra to run on my treadmill at home so who cares. Well it fit perfectly despite the confusion of getting two completely different size recommendations based upon the measurements from Amazon (40F or something ridiculous) vs the Glamorise website (42C), which still were not my usual size (40D). I went with the Glamorise website and it fit perfectly in the band and cup and I tightened the shoulder straps as much as they could go. The material is pretty scratchy. Well after jogging just one mile the straps had already broken the skin on BOTH my shoulders. This is no jog bra for full figured women and I certainly would'nt wear it in public/under my regular clothes either because it really makes your chest look funky. Save your money and go for a more expensive one is my advice and now I'm pissed because I certainly can't return it."
1,"Itchy band, terrible shape!","I ordered this sports bra online with trepidation because I have such a hard time finding sports bras in my size in brick and mortar stores. The reviews convinced me that it would be a good purchase, but it turned out to be terrible! The fabric on the band is incredibly rough and itchy, and the cups made my breasts look like they were in a 1950's cone-shaped bra. Some reviewers mentioned that they wore it as a regular bra, but it comes up so high in the front (which I wasn't expecting from the advertised picture) that I think it would show with a lot of my shirts, and I don't even wear low-cut shirts.Now I'm afraid to ever buy a sports bra online again. This time was a depressing failure."
4,Great Bra,"This bra is very supportive and comfortable. I love the moisture wicking and no seam cups (great for T-Shirts). The fact that you can get this support and shaping in a wireless bra is a dream come true because I absolutely HATE wires (they flare out on the sides and poke me in the arms no matter the brand - high dollar or low - and no matter that it's the correct size). This is the bra I wear for everyday use; it's too bad it doesn't yet come in beige. The only issue that I had with it was the band size. I was professionally measured to be a 38G, and the cups fit great, but the band is a little snug. I haven't had the bra long, so I'm hoping that the band will stretch out a bit or perhaps I will lose just enough weight to make the band more comfortable. I would recommend that if you are borderline to go with the next band size up. I think that I would have been much more comfortable in a 40G. We'll see though. All in all, this bra is everything that I've been looking for in a bra."
1,Too Small,"Ordered a size larger than I normally get (44DD) and it was still way too small - by at least 2 sizes. Sending it back and not buying any more bras on-line. Oh, also didnt like that it wasnt a pull-on bra PLUS the clasps in the back so even if it had fit, I doubt I would have kept it - but since I couldnt even begin to try it on, I'll never know if I could have lived with it or not.It is such a pain to find a GOOD & SUPPORTIVE bra for a large woman with enormous breasts! :o("
1,Terrible bra,I went to the Glamorise website to make sure that I would get an accurately sized bra.This bra is too tight in the band and too large in the cups. The straps dig into my shoulders. The bra feels like it is cutting into the sides of my breasts and the back is very uncomfortable on the shoulder blades.I also thought it would give separation: no. It squeezes my breasts together just like many other bras.This is the worst bra and one of the most expensive I've ever bought.
2,Itchy and uncomfortable,"Usually I like Glamorise products, but this bra was a disappointment. It fits fine around the bust, and does give a fair amount of support. However, I couldn't stand to wear it more than a short time, because the straps hurt my shoulders, and the bra felt itchy, especially in the hook and eye area, even after more than one washing."
3,Some Gems here,"This compilation is pretty widely available still and there's some really good tracks on it. But, like almost any compiliation, there are some clunkers too. Unlike a lot of comps that will put similar bands or styles together, there's not much cohesion here.I bought this for the Jawbreaker track (I had heard them play it live so I sought it out.) and it's probably my favorite of the disc still.There are a few others that I wouldn't have heard of the band or the song without this disc. Steel Pole Bathtub has an interesting one on here. Though they had been playing shows around my area for a while when I bought this, I had never heard them. The Beekeeper track is also a great one if you like semi-melodic guitar based rock.Most of the bands on here no longer are together. All in all, I'd look for this in the used bin since there's a good chance that only half the songs on here will appeal to you depending on what type of music you're into."
1,Debunked!,"The views in this book will be used by some crackpot defense attorney in court to help win a case against a whiplash-injured person.Sad.""Litigation neurosis"" is an idea straight out of the insurance industry's policy manual of how to avoid paying legitimate claims. It is a concept that has been debunked over and over again in the medical literature."
5,Sentimentality!,"This is an absolutely AMAZING collection of Counting Crows songs! It was the first CD of theirs I owned and it is simply inspiring. The renditions of their classic favorites is inspiring to me. I attribute much sentimentality to this music, and it always transports me to a different time and place and changes my mood. This is a CD you should DEFINITELY buy! It is worth the money a thousand times over!"
5,a great live cd---must have for a counting crows fan,"Just buy it.This two disc cd offers a great mix of electric versions of many of their songs as well as some acoustic versions too. Adam Duritz and the band re-vamp some songs so nicely that I find the studio versions of ""Have you seen me lately"" ""Catapault"" and ""Mr. Jones"" (as well as many others) seem to pale in comparision to these live versions. It proves that the Crows are an excellent live band that doesn't need to stick to that studio sound when on stage, to sound EXCELLENT."
5,Sweet Overdose of Emotion,"This set is definitely a must have for the Counting Crows fan. it offers great, spirited live variations of well known CC standards. The first CD is more intimate, painful, the second at times quite upbeat and less ""unplugged"". I wouldn't recommend CC it to seriously depressed people, but for those -like me- who love the occasional overdose of bittersweet pain (while overall being a happy camper) this set is perfect. I'd like to point out the line ""Is there one thing you remember about me""..it's sung so painfully beautiful you don't know whether to laugh or cry, or both."
2,They try too hard!,"The acoustic CD is wonderful. Adam is nice and quiet and puts some variety to his songs. Mr. Jones acoustic is one of the coolest songs I've ever heard. But their live concert CD is horrible. Adam trys too hard to make his songs sound new and original. It comes off as annoying. They sound better on an album. Adam up tight during the concert and ends up ruining some of his best songs. For example, ""Murder of One"" was changed from a slow quiet song to a loud obnoxious song in which Adam keeps yelling, ""Get the hell up!"" They've proved that they're just another stupid band without brains unlike DMB or Blues Traveler. I've lost all respect."
2,Pretentious Ramblings Do Not Replace a Melody,"Adam Duritz was at his best in August and Everything After, and its really been down-hill since then. The VH1 set (1st album) is awful in that it sounds like AD is sooo bored of doing the same old tunes, that he purposefully masacres the songs, especially their haunting melodies. He has a soul-tearing voice, but he doesn't realize that his non-melodious ramblings are simply not musically valid forays into diversity. He's just tired of the way the song sounds and instead of creatively changing it, he butchers it till its unrecognizable. I have listed to August and Everything After 1000 times, Recovering the Satellites 100, and this album, only a few times. I'm going to send it back. I was so excited to see this album on the shelves, this is truly a disappointment."
4,"Relax, Adam!","""Across A Wire: Live In New York City"" is a great live album from the Counting Crows, and a necessary one as well because of the Crows' superb and different live performances. Highlights on disc one include ""Round Here"", ""Mr. Jones"", ""Rain King"", and a stunning version of ""Anna Begins"". Highlights on disc two include ""Angels Of The Silences"", ""Have You Seen Me Lately?"", and ""Round Here"". However, this CD is not perfect. I am becoming more and more convinced after every listen that lead singer Adam Duritz takes his music (and sometimes himself) way too seriously. It almost becomes very depressing to hear his voice, but in a way that is a testament to the emotion he puts into his live performances. Still, his voice can become tedious and over-blown. Besides that, this is a great double-disc live set, even if the Counting Crows only released two prior studio recordings."
1,Don't do anything for me,"I was very excited when I saw this double disc set in the store. I rushed home and popped the first one into my VCR -- boy was I crushed. I didn't like it at all. So, I figured the second one would be much better -- Nope. Adam changed the melodies...and in some cases, the lyrics! The result? Songs that sound NOTHING like the versions that I love on the albums. What a huge disappointment."
4,Crows Live,"Across The Wire is a double live disc from the band. The first is an acoustic based set from their performance on VH1 Storytellers and the second is an electric set from their MTV Live At The 10 Spot show. Some songs crossover and appear on both discs, but that's a good thing. You get to a hear song like ""Angels Of The Silence"" which is a harder-edged song in its original electrified version as well as acoustically. The band is in top form and Adam Duritz can sing the heck out of a song in any style. The one major problem I have is with the Storytellers disc. The show has artists explain how they came about writing the songs they are performing and for some inexplicable reason, the band decided to edit those parts off the disk. That is a major reason to watch the show and their absence takes something away from the listening experience. That criticism aside, the album is still a good listen."
1,You have got to be kidding me?,"How can people like these two discs? They're slow, droning and awful, awful versions of the songs. I threw mine away."
3,Pretty Good,"I really enjoy most of the Countig Crow's album, but this one's a little different. Since it's live, the songs are a little more slow, which makes some of them sound more depressing. Don't et me wrong though, it's still good. My brother likes it perticularly because you can hear a lot more of the work with the instruments, so if you play guitar and are into Counting Crows, this album is a must have! ""Never go to New York City"" is REALLY depressing though."
5,duh,"i find these reviews almost as absurd as those on the subject of Recovering the Satellites. they butchered the songs (is it even possible to butcher one's OWN song?)? many of the songs mimic live versions that were played long before this album was released...some of them even date from before RTS. so no, they didn't ""butcher"" them. if anything the album versions are the butchered ones. and it's a live album, the songs won't be the same. why would you buy it otherwise? so you could hear them pull off studio renditions with slightly lower sound quality? the bottom line is, they're different. you might like it you might not. but don't sit and whine because you weren't smart enough to figure out that the songs might be arranged differently."
5,The Greatest,"These are the best CDs I've ever, heard, even better than the first two albums. The hidden song, Chelsea, is my favorite song. Anyone whose favorite band is not Counting Crows is a fool."
5,Across A Wire Rules!,"I really enjoyed listening to this awesome CD. Counting Crows continue to put out stirring songs that can really make you think. This CD even crossed the generation gap . . . me and my dad have both heard and enjoyed these two discs! My favorite is the 10 minute version of ""Round Here"" on the MTV disc, because I like to drum along to the song. . . their musicianship is admirable, and I would do anything to be able to record with a band of their stature! Rock on!"
3,Cool picks vs. awful mumblings: a horrible mix,"Although the album can boast of some really cool unplugged versions of songs in ""Recovering the Sattelites"", some were particularly pathetic. The worst was what they did to the wonderful song 'Anna Begins'. I can't believe these guys did not give enough respect to songs which got them admired in the first place. Senseless, out-of-pace ramblings may be interesting in a crowd, but in a CD it becomes irritating -- doesn't sound like music at all."
5,Best album of CC besides August and Everything After,"Live music from Counting Crows! I somehow only just found this CD after being a CC fan since 1994. The energy of this performance is exhilarating. Adam Duritz is still raw, a trait I love and miss, since I think the rawness of his performing and writing has evaporated over the last five years or so.I highly recommend this as a must have CD of Counting Crows. Two CDs, one is more acoustic than the other. My preference is for the second CD which is edgy and loud, long versions of songs I love. Sullivan Street, track 4 on CD#2 is awesome.There are two versions of ""Round Here"" on this CD, one acoustic with only Adam and Dave. Both are fantastic."
4,Definitive-A Must Have For Crow Fans,"This is a really cool disk. It shows the broad range of the group and how wonderful they really are live. When you hear the new variations of songs like round here and mr jones, you will see that this was worth the sixteen bucks. And when you hear songs like anna begins and raining in baltimore, you will see that it is worth so much more. If you like the crows, then you will like this cd."
1,Painful,"I am a big fan of live music and also enjoy the work of the Crows. However, this album was a disappointment. I can handle a song or two with a change of pace or tempo. It typically shows some nice creativity and range. But not every single song on the album. There is no need to reinterpret every single song on your playlist. This CD gets old and painful very quick. It would have been nice if they spent at least the second album (the electric version) covering some of their better material in the same or at least remotely similar format that made it a hit in the first place."
2,one misfire,"I object not to bands who change arrangments or words in their songs when performing live--it often energizes the shows and electrifies the audience. Van Morrison and Bruce Springsteen have been wildly successful at showing us the multifacetedness of their songs by doing just that. Unfortunately, the Crows take aim at doing it and end up with an endless, tiring bore. They can be a searing live band, but here the seriousness and earnestness bog the entire thing down, as the Crows destroy the likes of ""Mr. Jones"" and ""Anna Begins"" by stretching, bending, and remolding them until they break. All things in moderation, it is said. The Counting Crows missed that when they took a ball-peen hammer to their songs and let Adam Duritz run wild with his wounded-lover musings. One day they'll figure out that seriousness and artistry are not always the same thing."
1,HUGE disappointment.,"I gotta agree with the people who find the songs on the album butchered. AAEA is one of my favorite albums of all time. But it's an absolute CRIME what they've done to these songs on these CD's. Complete WASTE of money. This music isn't beautiful to listen to, it's pure, boring, whining, AGONY. Adam, get off your high horse and stop messing with perfection. We won't think you're a sellout. Honest."
4,Great Live Material ... but BOOTLEGS were better!,"This is great Crows material in a live setting. The songs are great and Duritz definitely puts a different spin on the same old songs when he does them live (as those of us who have been to Crows shows know).However, as much as I love this CD and would recommend that you get it, I still think the best ever recorded live Crows were the first three songs on a bootleg CD from Italy called ""Carving Out Our Names"". The first three songs on there were Round Here, Murder of One and Anna Begins, and were all three acoustic only versions. They were the most moving versions of those songs, and I was really hoping they'd be on this live album (they're not). Unfortunately, you can't buy that CD anymore because the bootleg company went out of business (I think). Oh well.Nonetheless, any Crows fan should have this new double CD. You'll love it. Oh, and Amazon.com has it at a great low price (thanks, Amazon)."
2,So-so,"Athough the crows are indeed a good live band, the recording quality on this CD is still less than admirable. (ie) track 11"
5,Beautiful easy listening,This is one of the best CD's I've ever listened to. Can't get enough of it. A good addition to everyone's CD collection
5,For people who are serious music fans,The people who dont like this album are probably the ones who bought Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer. Because the albums are not tailored for the catchy pop rodio scene where image is more than substance fans dont like them. It is sad that people can not recognize that this is emotion real emotion and that is what is at the core of all truly great music.
5,I agree with the person who called this album perfect ...,"Counting Crows is one of my absoulute favorite bands of all time , and purchasing this CD one one of the best investments I've made in a long time. It's really beautiful. I know some people feel the songs were butchered, but the twists and alternet lyrics are what keep this CD from being ""just another live album"". The first cd is the better of the two in my opinion, and like someone else said, I wish the songs on it would go on forever. PLEASE don't pass this album up because you believe the changed lyrics and melodies ""butcher"" all the songs....they really just make them all the more beautiful."
5,A must have for all Crows fans!,"Across a Wire provides creative interpretations of all the CC songs that people have grown to love. The Storyteller's CD allows the songs to take on a more mellow, acoustic, and relaxing feel. The Hammerstein Ballroom CD is reflective of Counting Crows performances during the Recovering the Satellites tour. I recognized many of the added/altered lyrics from the shows I attended. In essence, Across the Wire is a sampling of Counting Crows creative, fresh, and dynamic stage performances. This CD is definitely a gem!:)"
3,I'm thinking twice now if getting it was a good idea.,"I thought that I would love the CD. The CD case was cool looking, I loved the other CD's, but once I got it home, I really didn't like it as much as I thought I was going to. They took all the good old songs that you have memories attached to and switched them around and put in long whiny new lyrics that ruined the songs I was waiting to sing along to. If you like hearing god old songs with different lyrics, then go ahead and get this CD. If not...forget it, you'll hate it."
