2,NOT MUCH TO IT and MADE CHEAP!,"My son has had this toy for about a month now. As soon as the show debuted he wanted this. I have to say that for the most part it sits in the house with no play time. I think that is because there is nothing really to this toy. The sound quality is AWFUL. The volume is so low you can barely hear the phrases. It is supposed to turn into a wand but as another reviewer stated this has to be done manually and not by the push of a button. Also it looks like the end of the wand should light up, but NO it is just clear plastic. With all the other electronic toys out there and what they show on the TV series Bandai could have made this item have a few more features. I guess you get what you pay for and with this toy not very much."
4,Trevor,"I was glad to find Trevor since he is not being made yet with the newer group of Thomas the Train. However, I was disappointed that it was so small. I expecting it to be just a little bigger, but at least I found a Trevor for my grandson's Thomas the Train birthday. I'm sure he will like it."
3,It's a toy train,Wanted to buy this train for my neighbor who named her son after Trevor. It is a retired piece
5,captivating novel and three gorgeous stories,"I'd first learned about David Shrayer-Petrov and his work from reading his wonderful collection ""Jonah and Sarah."" His writings are a revelation to Jews in North America, and his voice reminds me of, on the one hand, Bernard Malamud, and, on the other, of Chekhov. I read Shrayer-Petrov's novel ""Strange Danya Rayev"" from ""Autumn in Yalta"" over the weekend, breathlessly, and I loved the three stories in the new book just as much. I'm recommending the book to all my friends and colleagues, and also to my book club. I wish more books about the Jewish experience and about the immigrant experience were as beautifully written as this one. Alexa G., civil servant, Philadelphia, PA."
4,Solution Manual,"Electrical Power system is one of the greatest text books I have read The only problem that I am facing in order to prepare my self for the PEO exam is the solution manual of the book which I can not find any where for purchesing, So even when I try to solve the problems at the end of each chapter I can not tell if I have solved this problem or that one correctly I wish the book came with an answer sheets"
5,Concise and informative,"This is a wonderful introductory book. It's fairly short - this is not one of those texts that has so much information in it that you get overwhelmed; if you want a really in-depth book on the subject, this isn't it - but you might want to read this one before you rush out to buy the eighteen-pound monster. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in self-study. I wish there were more introductory texts this easy to read and inexpensive."
4,GOOD For Review ONLY!!!,The clinical presentations really help quickly associate the material. Do NOT use these to learn pathology i recommend .Robbins Basic Pathology: With STUDENT CONSULT Online Access (Basic Pathology (Kumar)).Highly recommend if flashcards help you
2,Goljan Rapid Review is the way to go,I bought it thinking it would be a good supplement for class and the boards but the reality is that there only so much time to review things. I recommend to put your efforts on memorizing what is in Goljan's book and do not overwhelm yourself with too much information- this is exactly what this product is- you do not need it.
3,Pathology Flash Cards,Not helpful in the slightest for Knowledge level of Pathology. These cards are only meant for the end of Pathology studies and putting them into application.
1,An ignorant and distasteful work ...,"I think the Publishers Weekly reviewer got it just right about this one. Not only does the book fail to give any new information about poor Julia, being entirely derivatory on earlier works, it is also lacking in insights and terribly badly written. What this kind of third-rate stuff is doing on the lists of a respected UK publishing firm I cannot tell ..."
1,ONE OF THE WORST WRITTEN BOOKS EVER?,"I bought this book as a remainder for very little, deciding to give it a chance, but it was quite a grotesque. It seems to have been translated word by word from the original Norwegian. Nor can this book about the 'Victorian Ape Woman' be said to be in particularly good taste. I see there is a used copy advertised on Amazon for a penny - that is too much."
1,"Oh, Tan Dun, what happened to you?",This is not The Last Emperor. This is some sort of experimental nightmare you do NOT want to listen to.
1,This is not the music that made Ra great.,"Sun Ra was a musician who was not interested in the narrow conventions of jazz. He forged a new harmonic language, shattered boundries, combined the music with his often strange personal philosophy. But you would never know it from this record. Ra doesn't even play piano on it! He only doodles around on the synthesizer now and then, just to let you know he's there. The tunes are mostly old jazz standards, not his, and to my ear they sound like anyone could have played them. Pleasant, straight ahead jazz. But that's just boring when you're expecting the mighty Le Sony'r Ra. Check out the Evidence records first."
3,The Mechanics Meet Sad Cafe,"Saving Grace is a special 2-CD repackage of the final two Sad Cafe albums, Politics of Existing and Whatever It Takes (The first of which includes guest appearances by Paul Carrack and Mike Rutherford [who, like Sad Caf√© vocalist Paul Young, are from Mike & The Mechanics]). The albums included here are not the best projects from the group's discography, but Mechanics fans might find some of the material worth a good listen."
4,Collection of 3 previous releases,"This collection includes the following releases, which can be found individually on amazon.com:The Best Of John Denver...includes re-recordings of Denver's major hits, produced in the mid-1990's. The songs have mostly minor differences with the original versions. To my ear, the arrangements are fine. The vocals do not have quite the range that John Denver had in his prime. The order of the songs on the disk is different than on the packaging.Windsong...this is great recording released in 1975. One of my favorites.Folk Singer...selection of tracks from Denver's vast catalog featuring some of his slower and more socially-aware songs. This would probably be the weakest of the three disks for most fans.The package includes an 11-page booklet with a few photos and an overview of the artist's career.Overall, this is a worthwhile collection if you don't own any of the disks above. I would not pay the list price ($22), but a slight-used price of $10-11 is a bargain."
5,"Excellent, intelligent, dog-wise approach to life with a dog","Jack Russell Terriers may seem far removed from the monks' German Shepards, but the relationship-building, canine communication based training they have developed makes work with my pup (8-week old dominant-male JRT) a breeze. I can recommend this book and the New Skete Monks' dog philosophies without reserve."
1,"Outdated, harsh methods",This book is showing its years. Modern methods are much kinder and MORE efficient. Some of the discipline methods contained in this book could make a dog fearful and neurotic. It has some good points but beginners to dog training should be wary of it
1,The New Skete method did not work for me,"I was a novice dog owner and bought this book to help me train my increasingly agressive and out of control puppy. (I chose this one based on the Amazon customer reviews) I tried the training methods used by the monks even though they seemed to be overly confrontational. After a few weeks of the ""shakedown"" and ""alpha rollover"", the dog's behavior began to get even worse. The physical punishment was eroding any bond of trust that I had established with the dog. To make a long story short, I changed training methods and concentrated on positive reinforcement only. It made all the difference in the world. My dog is now almost a year old and she is truly my best friend (with first rate manners). I learned the hard way that you don't need to intimidate your dog to have her love and respect you."
1,a mixed barrel,"The Monks have some good ideas about dogs. But many of their ideas are scary! They advise hitting a dog til it cries. This is abuse and should never, EVER be done. If you truly want to train your dog, try a more humane approach, like Karen Pyror. The Monks do understand a lot about dogs--but i would never enrust my precious Labrador to them, and I would never use their abusive methods of ""training."" The thought of so many dogs being cruely trained as a result of the Monks scares me."
1,Cruel and outdated methods,"I completely agree with some of the reviewers above, who describe the methods in this book as cruel and dangerous. Hitting, yelling, and using fear to control a dog will only produce a fearful or aggressive animal, not the friend and companion that you want. Please enroll in a local puppy, or adult dog, class that uses praise and positive reinforcement in a fun environment."
2,Too traditional -- some bad mixed with the good,"Are you interested in training with positive methods? Then skip this book! The monks rely too heavily on outdated methods of discipline. Alpha rolls? Scruff shakes? Sorry, but these techniques are terrifying to dogs, potentially dangerous to trainers, and unnecessary. Yes, there are some great points, but there's no way I'd recommend this book to anyone."
5,Love it.,"Love it, this one was a gift to a friend. Enjoy the simple method they teach us how to train our dogs."
1,old fashioned and outdated training methods,"I had one of these for sale on Amazon and after I read it, I deleted it and threw it out. These methods used in this book are very outdated and unkind to the dog. Some of the advice is absurd, such as leaving a choke collar on the dog at all times. Dogs can easily be killed doing this. I would not advise anyone to buy this book or use training methods like this."
1,Beat the dog?,"This book is awful. I think one quote will sum up their dog-beating theory, ""How hard should you hit the dog? A good general rule is that if you did not get a response, a yelp or other sign, after the first hit, it wasn't hard enough."" pg 44 ""When they [the owner] approach they may find that the animal remains motionless or trembles...just leave the dog alone for a half hour."" pg 49 They recommend hitting your dog for housebreaking accidents, chewing, destructive behavior, stealing, aggression and trying to get on your bed at night. I was so sickened by this book I had to put it down by page 80."
1,Don't Bother!,"Buyer beware, it's a cheap CD for a reason! These are not the original artists! Warning, you get what you pay for. I did... ugh! The Worst!"
5,awesome,I'd been looking for this book for a while so I was pretty excited to find it here. Its awesome. A must have for anyone who is an animal lover and interested in the paranormal.
3,Three stars to balance the teeter-totter,"So this is where FReepers and DUers meet. Should be amusing. Oh, by the way, Krugman's analysis is pretty much a given, but the pendulum always swings back."
1,He worked for Enron as a con$ultant,Krugman tells Ameirca how we are losing our way while Krugman was on the payroll of one of the most crooked American companies in history. The man has no credibility.
2,He should have written a book rather then a collection,"Krugman, eminent columnist and economist, has compiled many of his great essays and many lesser works into this single volume that he says chronicles the `unraveling' of America under the Bush administration. The sad part here is not that his points are well made or that his essays are not good writing, the tragedy is he should have written a book and combined the ideas from his essays to form chapter outlines. As a collection this is a weak read where much fat is included with the meat. Not impressive, its almost as if he wanted to get it published before the election so he choose not to edit or expand on his central ideas. Badly presented material which otherwise is interesting, not the correct format."
2,"Easy to ""spin"" the content to fit predetermined idealogy","Good reading, but easily misconstrued by those who march lock-step with predetermined idealogies.Stu W, in Boston, shows semblences of this in his review."
4,This books is more than the sum of its parts,"Mr Krugman provides unique insight into the direction of the country. His broad situational awareness shows us not only what went wrong, but also where we are going. He shows contempt not just for the right, but for the media and political system that we all too often look away from, trying not to focus too much on the obvious flaws that bring the American democratic republic's legitimacy into question.I was skeptical of the idea of a collection of collumns, but it worked wonderfully. If you find the ideas in this book deeply flawed, please shed some light upon them with some substance. Otherwise, suck it up...sorry you don't like the bitter truth."
5,Oustanding,"It is a shame that Krugman, a first rate economist, MIT grad, and award winning professor at Princeton will be excorciated by the right as shrill and hackneyed. He is none of those things, nor is his book. The book is an investigation of the economic collapse of America since 2000. It is a 'liberal' book only so far as Krugman can point to the policies of the adminstration which have gotten the US to the point of economic collapse. And he wield numbers mightily. It is his own homework, his own number crunching, his own math based on the economy that leads him to his conclusions. The book does not rely on his opinions of the people that he likes and does not like, so it's difficult to compare it to a Coulter or Franken book.The book is important and outstanding. It should be required reading for every one of the 3,000,000 Americans who has lost a job in the past three years. It is an argument against supply side economics and deficit spending of the best calibre."
3,Lacking in Objectivity,"I read Krugman's book earlier this year. He raises some valid points about America's economy, actions of the Fed, as well as some of the priorities of the current political leadership. I found some of Krugman's arguments compelling, but there is a bias that pervades the entire book. For example, Alan Greenspan was a great guy and did wonderful work during the Clinton years. However, under the Bush administration he's an enabler and, consequently, not nearly as good as he used to be. Given that Krugman is an economist, I would have had much more respect for this work had there been less bias and more objectivity. All in all it's worth the time to read it, but I give it a weak three stars."
2,Some good criticism and a lot of propaganda,Expected a lot more from this book and would pay $500 for a book that would give a truly balanced view. Does anyone have any recommendations?
3,Not what I expected,"I generally like Paul Krugman's writing, so I was disappointed in this book. It is not really a book -- it is a compilation of Krugman's articles for Fortune and other publications, going back as far as 1997. This was not clear from the reviews I had read. If you want a collection of Krugman's editorials it is a great buy."
1,Misinformation at it's best (worst?),"Well, basically a tome of bitterness, lies, half-truths, and quite frankly, sickening partisan slop! I love it, Enron, Global Crossing, MCI/Worldcom, the dot-com fiasco...Slick Willie once again slides out of office just as the economy and the market bubble bursts (all set up during Clinton's watch), the US gets hit with 9/11, and this clown (Krugman) and all of his partners in hate (Franken, Moore, et al)try to pass the blame to Bush. Uh, boys and girls? Bush is cleaning up the mess wrought by Slick Willie and gang (his justice department, his state department, well, his administration).Move over boys, the real men and real women are back in charge."
1,Krugman is a liberal whiner,"This book shows all about that liberals are nothing but stupid crybabys and whiners. Krugman thinks that if you are a lazy drug addict the goverment should give you MY MONEY so you can take more drugs and kill people! He does not prove one thing he says, he just makes things up because he knows that stupid liberals will believe anything he says against President Bush! He works for the lieing New York Times . Heres a newsflash for him: Bill Clinton is the disgrace, not President Bush. Clinton caused the Moslum threat and Bush is killing them and that drives the liberals CRAZY! I love it!!! if Krugman is so happy about soicalism he should go live in russia or cuba. the Krugman and Al Franken (stupid NOT FUNNY idiot) are traiters and want to wreck America. They should join the talliban. Those books are for idiots. If you want to read all about how liberals are idiots read Ann Coulters book and Michal Savages book. Oh I forgot liberals are to stupid to read."
1,Krugman Not A Very Good Forecaster,"Do you laugh or cry when reading stuff like this, a direct quote from one of the talentless hack's columns of last year:""I predict that in the years ahead Enron, not Sept. 11, will come to be seen as the greater turning point in U.S. society""."
1,A GREAT BOOK.....IF YOU'RE A MORON,"This book, comprised of Mr. Krugman's New York Times columns over the past several years, should have the same appeal as did their initial appearance in the Times. Unthinking people, especially those with paranoia traits, eat this kind of nonsense up like starved Russian wolfhounds. And like that particular breed, Krugman readers tend to be those that were shortchanged when brains were distributed."
5,Lays it out in plain English,"This book is a true ""no spin zone"" that makes a devastating case against the regime of George W. Bush and shows Mr. Bush and his cronies for what they truly are: the lying-est, most corrupt, most mendacious, most anti-democratic administration in our country's history. They are conducting a class war against the bottom 90% of Americans, and we are getting our collective butts kicked! Read it and weep. Then, do something about it."
1,More Clinton spin,"Yet another attempt to spin the blame of our current economic and international problems away from the Clinton administration. Someone should tell this idiot that Bush didn't come into office until 2001, well after the problems detailed in this book began. Clinton rode the benefits of the Reagen/Bush economic reforms and was lucky enough to leave office as his policies began to cause disaster. Slick Willy strikes again."
1,Why is Krugman an economist?,"I do not know how this journalist became a ""well-respected"" economist. The book is a compilation of his New York Times articles, which, in turn, are re-processed ideas of liberal economists.This is the same person who thinks that a war could be good for the counry because it ""stimulates"" the economy. Economics is a very logical discipline; Krugman does not possess logic, but plenty of emotions.If you want a real economic book, buy something by Murray Rothbard or Ludwig von Mises."
1,The Left Wing Critics,"Isn't it interesting that the most positive of the critics of this God-awful book just parrot the negative reviews, substituting positives for the negatives. Could this be a measure of the intellectual capacities of the loony, left-wing critics. They also seem reluctant, or afraid, to identify themselves as friends or students of the former Enron advisor, now allegedly an instructor of economics at a university in New Jersey."
1,NYT writer continues hypocracy,"It's one thing to personally dislike our current President. It's another to abuse journalistic freedom to distort the truth. Where oh where can people looking for a balanced view of current events find one? If that is what you want, run away quickly."
3,"If ""they"" could only accept the truth","To be honest, I was a bit disappointed in the book. Would have liked more recent commentary mixed in with the articles, some of which are from 1999. There may be new info for readers who dont follow the economy however. It is most amusing (or sad)to read the negative reviews here. Our ""elected"" officials have basically sold the country to corporations, and anyone who is still a dedicated right or left winger is delusional or uninformed. Those in office are filling their pockets and pitting us against one another. Wake up (if you can)!"
2,One long editorial,"I am not a fan of George Bush, and was hoping this book would provide a comprehensive critique of his economic policies. What I got instead was a collection of editorials previously published in the print media. These editorials were published over a time span of 5 years, hence many of them were outdated by the time this book was published. The feel of the book is sarcasm, and it is one long polemic against George Bush and the neo-conservatives in his administration. Unfortunately, since it is comprised of editorials, there are no figures, no charts, no graphs and very few references. Instead, we get paragraph after paragraph that mention this number or that statistic, but without proper sourcing. Also, because it is comprised of a series of reprinted editorials, the flow is not good, and many of the points are not argued well.I would not recommend this book."
3,"A Worthwhile Read, Although It Has Issues","The vast majority of the book consists of articles written by Mr. Krugman over the last five years. Most of the articles outline Mr. Krugman's issues with the policies of the current Bush administration in an easy-to-follow and thoughtful manner.After reading the book I am left with two main issues: Obvisouly Mr. Krugman is limited in space in his articles, but here he wrote a book. If he thinks we are on the wrong track why does he not suggest what we shuold be doing? That would really complete the book. Also, the last chapter does not flow well as the ending. I was expecting a summary of sorts, but the last chapter seems to be the miscellaneous thoughts folder."
4,"Timely, if biased","Krugman is a brilliant economist, and that's something his detractors almost always find hard to digest. I suppose many of them come from the Ludwig von Mises institute, that incubator of mostly crackpot economic theories.As to those who keep insisting that Krugman is an idiot, a communist, or whatever, I can say this. Read his books. Then if you have anything to say, argue rationally for or against what you've read.However, if you keep regarding the cranks from the Austrian school as prophets, you're not likely to increase knowledge. The Austrian School was composed of ideologues, who gave not a whit to mathematics and statistical evidence; all they considered important were their own ideas. Hence, the lack of rigour in their works; isn't it ironic, that conservatives, who are known to favor the ""hard sciences"" over all other academia, have decided to reject the most mathematically precise branches of economics for the most cheezy varities?"
1,EGOMANIACAL RANT,"If you want the gist of this book, just go to the NYT archive and pull up a few of his op-eds. The book is very repetitive and obviously outdated.Kruggy was a well paid con$ultant for ENRON as they were scamming investors and Enron employees, most of whom lost their life savings. He even pumped up the company in a Fortune magazine article, favorably comparing it to Goldman Sachs.I hope the hate this egomaniac is spewing doesn't incite violence. Following this puppetmaster is suicide."
1,Krugman Is A Tiresome Person,"One of the reviewer's tells us that Krugman's book is a ""must read.""It's only ""must-read"" if you haven't already read or heard any one of the seemingly endless number of interviews Krugman has given over the last few weeks as he relentlessly promotes his book. In each one he repeats the same talking points with merciless precision -- same key messages, same metaphors, same lame attempts at humor, same twitching, stammering Woody Allen-esque delivery. The key thought that he endlessly spouts is:""Krugman on the book: 'The central theme is, we're being lied to by our leaders, and I just felt I really needed to put that very strongly in context.'"""
1,Hugh Letdown!,"Loving anything Australian as I do, this CD was a huge disappointment. The songs I'm sure would be good if done by other artists. Reminds me of having Pavaroti sing songs of Hank Williams! The artists had too much of a stuffy air about them for the music they were singing. The songs are more folky and the singers sound more ""opera-etic""."
4,Une bonne id√©e de la musique folklorique australienne,"Lorsque j'ai command√© ce disque, je n'avais qu'une tr√®s vague id√©e de la musique folklorique australienne. En √©coutant ce CD, j'ai remarqu√© que cette musique ressemblait beaucoup √† la musique folklorique irlandaise, surtout avec l'accent de certains chanteurs. J'ai bien aim√© ce disque et il vous donne une bonne id√©e de la musique folklorique australienne."
3,Buy this please!!,"A very young HG at his worst...but ever so cute and out of sync. Props are hilarious, they look like out of a high school play. But most entertaining when you factor in how good those two (Grant and Samms) are today. I pull it out and play it for fans who want a good laugh. What can I say...everyone needs a DVD like this one for pure enjoyment. I love HG and this is just part of the library."
1,The unusable copy,"This movie copy was of such poor quality it could not be viewed.Very blurry and almost no color,You may have it back."
3,An Hilarious Romp through James II's Court,"I recently copied my old VHS copy--recorded when this movie aired on TV back in 1988--over onto DVD and remembered how delightfully hilarious this movie is. It isn't supposed to be hilarious, but it is. This is the first thing I ever saw Hugh Grant in, and it's colored my opinion of him ever since. (Oh, and the description of the movie above is wrong. His character falls in love with the character played by Lisette Anthony, not Emma Samms).This is melodrama at its best, and since it's based on a novel by the queen of the melodramatic historical romance novels--Barbara Cartland--that is to be expected. But it's worth viewing just to see Hugh Grant at his most awkward in one of his first-ever roles."
2,Poor copy,I too think that this copy was very poor I could hardly see it and there were almost no color to this movie.
2,Amusing ... perhaps unintentionally so.,"I imagine that if any of the huge-name actors in this movie (such as Hugh Grant or Michael York) were ever on a talk show on which the host showed a clip of this movie, they would most likely be quite embarrassed. Other reviewers have noted the accuracy of the period costumes, and this may be so, but it is nonetheless a romance of the cheesiest calibre. It smacks of hackneyed melodrama, silly dialogue (""I should shoot you where you stand, but that is not my way.""), and hokey lighting during the ""romantic"" bits. It was, I believe, a made-for-TV movie, though, so this is perhaps to be expected.All the same, if you are a fan of the actors who are in it -- especially Hugh Grant, and would like to see him in one of his early works, or if you are like me and are (unintentionally?) amused by cheesy romances, then you will certainly enjoy this. =)"
4,A good film that I enjoyed watching!,"It isn't the quality of Pirates of the Carribean or Lord of the Rings, but it has a nice oldtime feel to it that I love. Hugh Grant is young and vibrant in this film of his earlier years. The characters are all fairly well portayed. It has some good fight scenes as well, again, not as good as nowaday fight scenes, but still captivating. The costumes/makeup are wonderful to look at, as well as the variety of scenery. It has just the right amount of romance, action and drama. And good suspene! I give it 4 out of 5 stars simply because I think it could be better quality, but overall, its a good movie to watch over and over again for years to come."
1,it stunk....,"it stunk what else can you say about it? brendan fraser wasn't even there. the whole movie was dull i almost slept through it , and another thing people just stick to the first one , you don't want to be dissapointed. i collect disney movies , but this one forget about it , the one you shoyld really watch are the incredibles , and the polar express , you won't be dissapointed."
2,Horrible Features,This movie was a whole lot worse than the first one(I actually like the first one). You can tell the animals are computer animated. The actor that plays George is terrible! The only thing good about it is the plot which actually sticks to the story line of the first one.
1,No Brannon Frasier,Why Bother than? Your getting a movie that didn't hit the theaters and went to DVD what does it tell you?
3,Julie benz),I am a huge angel fan. This dvd has darla in it. lol. her hair is longer and lighter but she has her voice so you can tell it's her. GO ANGEL
1,Worse than terrible.,"Not a single funny moment....neither one of my kids laughed once. Very very disappointing. My five year olds comment ""this is terrible, I like the first one best"""
3,Second George,"Yes, it is a stupid movie but let's not forget that this was meant to be a stupid one. In that key it's pretty well done. Sure, don't watch it if you're in the mood for something deep and serious but if you just wish to spend some hour and half with no thinking or even laughing at sometimes, well, in this case it's OK. Most of kids love it indeed, as it was also for the previous part. And personally I liked half-naked Christopher Showerman as new George! :-)"
5,I only give it 5 stars for T.H. Church,"The replacement George is nothing like the B. Frazier in the first movie. What's with the goofy smile?! I liked the first movie, so did my kids. You can tell in this one that the Ursula and George actors are really trying to be the Ursula and Georgia from the first movie - but they lay it on too thick...syrupy sweet thick. Ugh! I only watched it because I happen to like Thomas Haden Church, who was better looking than George! Tom Church, please do more serious films!"
1,One of the top 10 worst sequels of all-time!,"I remember watching the GOTJ cartoon on Cartoon Network back in the 90s, and seeing the 1st George of the Jungle movie when I was 2 years old at the movies, it was the first film I saw in a theater and I laughed my ""coconuts"" off and sang the theme song when my parents drove me home. After hearing that a sequel was in the works, I wasn't too enthusiastic and knew that it would be bad. The only good thing about this retched sequel was the opening animated cartoon opening, that's it! Like the title says, here's my pick of the top 10 worst sequels of all time:1. George of the Jungle 22. Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House3. Caddyshack 24. Speed 2: Cruise Control5. Crocodile Dundee 26. Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles7. Wayne's World 28. Shrek the 3rd9. Stuart Little 310. Spider Man 3Avoid this trash @ all costs, and just buy the original with Brendan Fraser. You'll LOL!"
1,george of the jungle 2,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. We all loved the first one, but hoped at least my children would enjoy this second one, and it was so pathetic, my little boy turned it off, and asked if he could put it in the trash! Sorry to be so gloom about it, but need to save someone their money."
2,It needed Brendan Fraser,"I couldnt finish watching it, it was that bad. To each his own. Shoulda stuck with Brendan Frasher. wont watch again."
4,Not half bad (Should be a 3 1/2 star rating),"If you can find this somewhere around $10-15 dollars and enjoy Soundgarden-ish sounding vocals, some 90's style alt-rock with a mix of blues and southern rock and some creative choices here and there, this is a pretty enjoyable rock album that's worth a spin every now and again. Some real potential in a few of there songs makes me think these guys could take it to the next level at some point."
5,"Excellent, a budding young superstar",An excellent addition to my music collection. I have heard Sova a couple of times in the Michigan area. One of technos budding superstars.
4,Crown Pictures,"Most of these are just really, really bad movies from the 60's & 70's about bikers, drugs, foul play, drugs & sex. There is 1 documentary which is best skipped-Death Riders. Frankly, I like them a lot. Yes, they are all low budget, racist (by today's standards) & in some cases horribly acted. Some of yesterday's phobias about the gay population or bikers are prime time tv now. Go ahead & get it for nothing more than for the history they represent. Enjoy."
2,these movies suck,"Man these are some real stinkers. Maybe 2 of them were interesting but the rest, its like a skunk walked in. I'll be reselling mine I'll never watch them again."
2,Pretty Sad,"I was very disappointed in getting this book...let alone signing up for a class that is using it. The book is written for someone who has no idea what it's like to work in an office. I've been working for 25+ and have a very strong knowledge of records management and administrative work. I'm sure that's why I was so disappointed. The questions are so lame that they scare me. My favorite ""A device that contains the name of the subject or number given to the file folder contents is called a(n) ________"" Answer: Label. There is much time spent on tasks that can only be learned on the job as each company does their own thing. Learning words like ""file"" ""folder"" ""guide"" ""code"" ""sort"" is not what I would expect from a college OR highschool level course. For a GED class training a student for an entry level office job this might be helpful as it is very basic. If you have practical working experience, keep looking. There has to be a better manual out there!Live and learn."
3,Decent information,"Would have been nice if there were more citations and a stronger bibliography. Content seemed sort of dated, but for the price I wasn't disappointed in the text. I've passed it along to a younger, less experienced member in the profession that will benefit greatly from the content."
4,file this,"As we should all know our alphabet, filing should not be this difficultThis is better than learning Word when we think we know it all"
5,THE REAL KING,"I always put people right when they go on about Michael Jackson. I tell them about Jackie Wilson and how Jackie is so far greater in all areas it's not even funny. They never believe me until I show them Jackie on DVD or CD. THEN, they believe me! This is another wonderful compilation on the great man and another excellent introduction - but remember - it is only an introduction, GO BUY SOME MORE! More excellent liner notes and great CD production. A word to Brunswick - release the unreleased and alternate takes by Jackie please!!"
5,This is a must have for drinkers! Oi Oi Oi!,"This is a terrific CD, and the live tracks on it (especially Skinhead on MBTA) are awesome. The only way this CD could be better if they would have included ""Caps and Bottles - Live"" from the Early Years, but oh well. Anway, this CD, just like ""Do or Die"" is full of great drinking music with Mike McColgan singing.The previous reviewer dissed Al Barr. I have no problem with Al Barr, if you go to a concert and see them live, Al Barr sings the old songs just as well and alot faster than Mike did. Also, if you pick up their new spit with the Business ""Mob Mentality"", you can hear Al singing ""Boys on the Dock"", and Al does and excellent job."
3,Additive,"Great tasting and mixes fairly well with water, but the added FOS leaves my digestive tract a little distressed. If it were not for that would have given an extra star."
1,Poor Production,"First off, i love the scribble jam videos themselves. that being said, i feel that the description of this dvd is a bit mis-leading. it does state that it has the best of battles from several years, what it doesnt tell you is that the sound quality is horrible, and the majority of it looks very amateur in filming as well. none of the battles follow any logical order, and most of them dont even show the conclusion, such as who won.its really too bad, a lot of the MCs that i listen to are on this DVD, but theres nothing on this DVD that you cant see or even download on a video site.as far as the quality of the item i actually received from Amazon...very poor. the wrapper inside the plastic cover, is severely wrinkled.what i would recommend is just watching the battles you enjoy on a site that hosts videos, and save your money. this dvd isnt worth the money."
5,Very Fun Rod,I ordered this rod for my boyfriend so that he could take into rural mountain streams. He absolutely loves it. Claims its the most fun in a flyrod he has ever had.
5,Great intro about hamsters for kids,I bought this book for my kids to see if they wanted a hamster. It is very informative and my children learned alot. Needless to say we did not buy a real hamster: this book is great!!
5,Best Hamster Book I've Ever Read,I think this book is the best book ever written on the subject of hamster care. I love how it is easy for kids to understand.
2,UGH,"I hate this book. Sure, the pictures are nice, but most of the info is out dated. Honestly, the first time I read this book I gagged. I am an expert on hamsters, and books like these drive me NUTS. Following thi book could actually kill your hamster."
3,Action pulp,"PLUNDER IN THE SUN's cover seems to tout an action packed adventure involving ancient treasure and it DOES have that. It also, however, has needless and repetitive passages about ancient Inca and how it was destroyed making it seem like you needed history lessons to understand why these guys were going plundering for the treasure. Also seemed to get pretty predictable about halfway through.I just felt like there had to be better worldly adventure pulp out there begging to be reprinted than this mediocre offering."
3,Opportunity Knocks Twice,"I have always enjoyed reading the Brio Girls books. This story did not hold my attention very well. I was soon annoyed with all of the shallow and stupid things that guys were saying about girls. Not all guys are that icky. I had a hard time believing that Jessica would be able to date Tyler so easy without putting all of her emotions into the relationship. Also, there is no way that I guy could be best friends with 3 girls without someone getting attached. Maybe I am getting to old for these stories. Still the message of Gods love is still intertwined in each chapter so I give the author thumbs up for that."
4,great 80's rock,"This is such a good piece of 80's rock. It is great to be able to have a compilation of these two albums on one CD. If you like rock and roll, this one is for you!!!!"
4,Lita Rocks!,"I have always had a hard time finding the Out for Blood CD. It seemed to be very rare. I saw this product on Amazon and immediately purchased it. This is a great deal. Two remastered cds in one package. The music takes me back to the 80s hair metal days. Lita rocked it out on both cds. If you don't have Out For Blood, this is your chance to get it.Great music if you are feeling nostalgic for some 80s metal!"
3,Early Lita Ford,"These are Lita Ford's first two solo albums, remastered on a single CD. Out for Blood, recorded in 1983, was marred by inferior production. The songwriting was not as good as on Lita's later albums, and there was a noticeable lack of coordination between the rhythm section and lead guitar. Dancing on the Edge, released in 1984, was a significant improvement, and established Lita as a major force in metal. The melodic ideas and songwriting were more inspired, the playing was tighter, and the production was noticeably better. Dancing on the Edge rates four stars, but Out for Blood only two, mainly because of the production issues."
2,Where the heck is it??,I ordered this book ALONG time ago and it STILL hasn't come in!Whats up with that amazon? The sign saying 'Usually ships in 6 days' is WAYYY off.
3,so-so,"This book is an interesting overview of complexity but seems more like a novel about scientists than a novel about science. I think Gleick's ""Chaos"" is a better overview of the science involved. I was disappointed by the lack of equations or pictures that I could think about or play with.An interesting book for the layman, but if you want to really know how things work - look somehwhere else."
4,Interesting story,"The main thread of the book is the Santa Fe Institute, a multidisciplinary research and education center founded in 1984 in the US. The institute deals with complex adaptive systems from physical, biological, computational, and social point of view. Complexity can be found in for instance environmental, technological, biological, economic, and political systems. Hence, this research area is highly relevant.The story was interesting to read. However, being an engineer, I prefer a shorter and more concise style of writing. A deeper mathematical discussion about complexity would also have been appreciated. The book tells an exiting scientific story, but it is more of a well written novel than a technical textbook."
2,Meh...,"I found the book disappointing. This is definitely NOT in the league of Chaos.In particular, the coverage of the material of the subject, complexity, was very thin. Waldrop would bring up a subject, address it with some metaphor, and then move on without providing any details. The vast majority of the book is a series of stories about scientists at the Santa Fe Institute who had their inner-child hurt on their journey to discovering complexity. A better title for the book would have been ""The Road to Santa Fe: A Tail of Grief.""The book had two redeeming features, the breadth of the material covered and the bibliography; both provide direction for more fruitful reading. Really, getting the feel for most of the subjects covered in this book could be found by putting 'complexity' into wikipedia and reading for a day, though.Since it was not a complete waist of my time, I gave it 2 stars."
4,Thanks for good service.,This book is very useful for my writing. It was a great help to get it so quickly. The service is good.
5,Brilliant,"For me as a software developer that is interested in self-organization, adaptation, complex systems, et cetera, this book was immensely satisfying. I'm interested in how this applies to software development, both in terms of the process of developing a system, and how to grow/evolve software instead of build according to plans (which is an approach that I think is deemed to fail).I'm adding this to my list of recommended reading for programmers."
2,Disappointing,"I don't believe many people are too much interested in finding out how scientists work with other people by reading several hundred pages. Maybe a chapter or two will suffice for that purpose. People who buy this kind of non-professional book on science and engineering want far more than that - they want to understand the underlying ideas and the significance of the ideas, written in accessible English.Simply, this book spent too much space on explaining how scientists worked, and not much on WHAT they found out. Disappointing, and purchase of this book made me believe that reviews and ratings on Amazon may not be trustworthy."
1,Major Disappointment,"The title was the most interesting part of this book. But why not change it to more accurately reflect the content to something like ""The History of the Santa Fe Institute""? The autobiographical journey the book takes the unsuspecting reader on is filled with too much background and not enough substance. I consider books to be some of the most valuable items in the world today. However, upon completion of this book, I looked at my wife and said ""I've got to throw this one away. I don't know of anyone else that I would wish it on and I will never read it again."" And so, in the trash can it went. It probably isn't THAT bad of a book, but I could never recommend it to a friend."
3,Novel,"The first chapter was quite frankly utterly stupendous, especially if you love Economics. The rest of it is a lot of rough descriptions of what happenned in Santa Fe. Shame really, had the rest of the book been like the first chapter, it would've been amazing."
4,A good piece of history of science and economics,"This is a very interesting book on history of science and economics and how they interact with each other. If you want to know how economics is related (or should be related) to science, start from here. Every economist should read this book."
2,Complexity by M. Mitchell Waldrop,"Several years ago I read the book at the suggestion of a colleague. He was impressed with the ideas. I was not because the author too uncritical about the difficulties of implementing the Santa Fe agenda of modeling complex systems. At the time, I was particular unimpressed with the tale of Brian Arthur's efforts to forge new grounds in economics. Subsequently, Arthur's efforts got pubished and inspired an unfortunate development in economics. Arthur presented a strained theory of why bad technologies might become adopted. He was inspired to the study by examining what have since proved false charges of ""important"" bad choices of technology such as typewriter keyboard layout. Unfortunately, the refutations have not caught up with his work and mischief abounds. It adversely affected the Microsoft antitrust case."
1,Is this a work of fiction?,"If you know even a little of the truth of the stories here, you have to be disappointed in this treatment, and even more disappointed that so many seem to just lap it up. In the end, the result will be massive disappointment with complexity research and researchers. But most of the people who achieve star status in this book will likely be long gone."

1,PR flak for Calif.,Very disappointed in it. More form than substance. Author was too intent on patting CA schools on the back.
1,Does not deliver.,"I expected phsyics, I expected science and theory. I expected my horizons to be expanded. This book is trash. This book is just a jumble of science history, and narratives about other peoples accomplishments. Anyone who reviewed this book over 1 star should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Not loud enough,ITs big and stuff..but its not super loud..its just kinda loud..needs to be louder! I just expected at more out of this clock...need a screaming mimi.
1,worse item i bought,i got this clock isnt loud only work half the time i dont like it i would never buy another one would send it back for credit
2,Now way out but crazy repackaging,"Don't bother. This is basically the same ""No Way Out But Forward Go"" live show, but without the second disc of video from the show. Skip it and get that two disc ""No Way Out..."" re-issue."
2,No Way Out without the video!,"Shoulda recognized the track order I suppose, but for the price I won't beat myself up too much. It's a nice cover photo of mid-80's KJ, but spend the cash on No Way Out But Forward Go, instead. The packaging on that is [bad], but you get to watch the performance on video, too."
2,Memo To Knife Fans: Wait For A U.S.Version.,"Yes,I'm one of those Shonen Knife fans that pays big bucks for import singles and albums,simply because I love the band,and their stuff rarely finds a U.S. or U.K. distributor fast enough for my liking.But that doesn't necessarily mean you have to be so obsessed as well.I've been a long time fan of the band,and this release just isn't all that great. It just doesn't work as well as previous releases. As with their previous albums,excluding ""all English"" versions,this one goes back and forth between songs sung in Japanese and English,and this time,they tend to stumble.If you thought Shonen Knife was mostly Naoko's band,this album proves that Michie was an integral part of the band.Maybe it's just a rough first outting for Atsuko & Naoko,I don't hate the album,but I hope their future efforts improve.I suggest enjoying ""Happy Hour"" and ""Brand New Knife"",before paying import prices for this release."
1,worst game ever,"My new favorite holiday tradition is reading Tue reviews of this awful board game because some are hilarious. Between 4 adults, 3 of whom have post graduate degrees, we could not understand the rules of the game. I challenge someone to write a PhD thesis on this topic. But instead, just get drunk and read reviews. You're probably reading this because you already bought. Hopefully not for full retail price."
1,Bad,"This is quite possibly the worst board game of all time. I bought it for $1 at a Goodwill store. It was in like new condition. Once I had it, it was obvious why it wasn't played much, if at all. And once I tried playing it, I wish I had my dollar back. This is a cute looking game. However, it is a terrible game to play. It is just plain bad."
2,game sucked,While I absolutely love the movie - this game sucked big time. If you buy it for just the novelty of it great. If you want to play the game don't bother.
2,Not what I expected,"My family is pretty into this movie- We've got the leg lamps, ornaments, shirts, PJ's, you name it- we got it. So wqhen I saw this board game I knew it would be perfect for my husband- He received the pink bunny PJS the year before. When the game came it was low quality and very boring to play. The actual rules and game set up were far too complicated and we ended up playing our own way. If it weren't for the bizarre set up this may have ranked higher from us but it just didn't deliver. next time I will pony up more money for a better quality game. Oh- and the questions were either too easay or freakishly hard. Not a lot of gray area for normal people (People who only watch this movie at christmas as opposed to year round such as my family full of uber fans)!"
2,Difficult and Defective,"This toy arrived sealed and was supposedly new; however, it was missing the directions. When we tried to find the directions on line, we found that it was probably better that they were missing because it is a difficult game and the directions are apparently 3 pages long. In looking at the pieces and playing cards that come with it, it appears that this will be a very difficult game, one that seems like it won't be much fun. I bought the game as a birthday present for someone who is a huge fan of the film. For an avid fan, it's an interesting piece of memorabilia, so it's not a total loss. However, it would have been nice if we could have played the game as well."
2,Good idea - lousy instructions,"Great idea, everyone in the family was looking forward to playing this game. After an hour of trying to understand the instructions, we just made up our own rules. So, unfortunately, it is questionable if we will ever open the box again."
1,Most complicated rules ever,"As a family, we were looking forward to playing this game together. As I began to read the four pages of rules, I started to get confused. I reread the rules and still didn't understand them. We ended up making up our own rules to follow and played. We soon ran out of trivia questions. I don't recommend anyone buy this game. Very disappointing."
2,Confusing Directions!,"I received this as a gift last year and like most others here, gave up on the novel of directions (as did the 5 other adults who were playing with us). There really is no point to the game that we could tell... we made up our own rules, had fun playing it and will play it every year - no peeking at questions and no studying beforehand! If you buy this, just know that you have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the directions.... and then maybe not!"
2,"ALTERNATE RULES FOR ""A CHRISTMAS STORY"" BOARD GAME","I, too, was totally frustrated with the un-playable rules that came with the ""Christmas Story"" game. I have, therefore, come up with a set of alternate rules to play by. They may not be the best rules, but at least the game can be played and enjoyed. If you would care to have these alternate rules, email me at albracht@consolidated.net and I will email you the rules free of charge. I just want you to enjoy the game as much as it should be enjoyed -- as much as the movie is enjoyed.Bob"
1,A HUGE UPSET!!!,"I bought this as a christmas gift for my boyfriend because this is one of his favorite movies of all times! We opened it on Christmas Day to play it and started to read the directions (which is in fact 4 pages) After reading the first page of directions I felt stupid because I wasn't understanding them at all. I looked online to read the reviews to see if maybe we were stupid by not understanding the rules for this game, but it turns out we aren't stupid, the creators of the game were! It seems they didn't even bother test out the rules to make sure they work. Overall, this was a huge disappointment and a waste of $30. Don't bother to purchase this game, enjoy the movie and the memories that you, your friends and family get from A Christmas Story."
1,Too Complex,"This game is cited as being for ages 8 and up... All I can say is a group of honors high school students, honors college students, and adults with college and master's degrees had trouble with this game. We are huge fans of the movie the game is based upon, hence the purchase, but the game's creators have tried to incorporate too much and made the game near impossible to play, let alone score points and win. For visual value, the game looks great and created a lot of conversation. The leg lamp game pieces were problematic, as they tip easily - actually, maybe an 8 year old would not have been bothered by that..."
1,The worst board game in history!,"For a family that loves games and the moving this game was a huge buzz kill! We never got through the direction to figure out what the heck we ere even supposed to do. It is a great idea, but horribly done."
2,A Christmas Story Board Game,As true fans of the movie...we were all very disappointed in the game. I would not recommend anyone buy it. The manufacturers should rethink it.
2,Complicated Rules........,"We were very excited to play this game after our Thanksgiving dinner. The rules and object of the game seemed somewhat confusing with many unnessary steps. We decided to make our own game using their questions. As it says on the box, it's better to play after you just watched the movie. We thought we were pros. re. this movie, but believe me, the questions are tough. I think we were expecting more of a ""Christmas Story Trivia Persuit-type game, which would have be much more enjoyable."
4,tough but worth it,"as i knew when i purchased the game, the rules are difficult to learn, let alone read. we were way too excited to figure them all out when we first opened it, so we went through the questions and had a great time just quizzing each other and moving around the board (it was amazing how much the 5-8 year old kids knew). after reading the directions further, they seem more than doable. all around, it's a fun game to add to any collection!"
4,"Interesting, and surprisingly readable.","Before I read this book, I knew nothing about Byzantium. So I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information, and realized after I started that I had made a mistake; I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was the third volume of a three-volume set. Doubtless, it would have been less overwhelming to start at the beginning, especially for someone like me, with no previous knowledge of the subject. Still, I learned a great deal from this book; not only was it informative, but it wasn't nearly as dry and impenatrable as I'd been afraid it might be. In fact, the style is downright readable; Norwich actually has a rather pleasant, if dry, sense of humor.I definitely plan on getting the first two volumes of this series, and continuing my education on the history of Byzantium."
4,FASCINATING,"The author is not a professional historian. He does not know how to read the sources critically and is unable to select and reject the secondary literature, but he has a beautiful style, and if you're not too concerned with historical accuracy, it is a pleasing introduction to a fascinating subject. DOWN WITH GIBBON!"
1,Pity about the facts,"John Julius Norwich possesses a mastery of the English language expressed in flowing descriptive prose which envelops the reader to the point that you almost feel you were there. Unfortunately he does so in apparent ignorance of any of the scholarship of the last twenty years, and indeed much of that since the Second World War. His treatment of major issues such as the development of Pronoia simply does not fit the facts, while the minor innacuracies cast by the wayside remove any remaining credibility. A good novel, but go to John Haldon for Byzantine History."
1,A very difficult book to read.,Thsi book is for someone who has an extense knowledge of the Byzantine empire. I do not posses such knowledge and got lost inmediatly while trying to read this book. The author's style adapts for someone who knows all the history of the people involved in this empire already. I couldn't even finish the first chapter because I found myself asking: who is he talking about? every two lines!
4,Superb book on a sadly neglected subject.,"Norwich has here filled in a gap in the body of work for the general reader. Byzantium was an important element in world affairs for a millenium and a half yeat this is the only book to deal with it. Thankfully, he does it well. His style is engaging and he does a good job of condesing all of the information. My only objection is that he could have related campaigns more thoroughly and the changing methods of warfare more than he did. He could have done this by putting less emphasis on building projects and architecture. This only a personal preference however. I strongly recommend all three volumes."
3,ego state therapy,"Mmmmm, I liked this one but do not,will not use it as much in my work. It was like remedial reading for something I skimmed over when in school. The book was recommended for background with dissociative disorder work and I'm glad I took the time with it. I disagree with some of the interventions used because others seem to cause less distress with clients and I'm not so much into the hypnosis stuff. I kind of took it with a grain of salt for being a good piece from the time frame the authors were doing the research and the work. For current ego state work I highly recommend April Steel."
5,Gorgeous Feathers!,"Even though this book is aimed more at the hand quilter, it is very useful for getting inspired for machine quilting."
4,Excellent for beginners,I am a new machine quilter and love the look of feathers. The clear instructions and tips have been very helpful. Since I am just starting to learn how to machine quilt I would have liked to have had a little help in what direction to quilt the designs provided. Small arrows on the patterns would be great. I am very pleased with my progress so far following the steps Shackelford outlines and know I will keep this reference book close at hand for a long time to come.
2,Bowl's interior quality is inferior,"After the first wash of this bowl it's clear the interior isn't stainless steel. Seems more likely that it's just plain aluminum ... or the coating is either bad or nonexistent. It's now dull and almost chalky on the inside of the bowl, unlike my other stainless mixing bowls by another brand, always shiny and smooth. Won't be buying this brand again."
2,poor quality,This bowl warps at the bottom. I do not recommend to put any liquid in it to avoid splashes. I guess this is what you get if you buy cheap products.
3,Had returned,Nice bowl but wrong size..thanks for the return and your time! We did find another that was right for what was needed.
2,"Poor Quality, Cheap price.","Item is very thin and quality is sub-par. Arrived with small dents in bottom and rough swirl marks on inner surface. Cheap price and a cheap item. Minimal utility, would not buy again..You get what you pay for?..this item seems a bit less than it should be , even for the cheap price..Item was well-shipped(don't think dents arrived during shipping)..Live and learn.."
2,Small.,"While this is a decent mixing bowl, I agree with other reviewers that it is smaller than it is advertised to be."
5,Good Product.,Came right on time. the product fit and it was easy installation. I am very happy with this product and this vendor
3,It can be cut up enough to fit into a 2002 Cavalier,"This product is just ok, not good. The pieces are soft plastic and bend easily. I used it to put an aftermarket radio in a 2002 Cavalier. The radio had to stick out of the dash about an inch to fit but that's mostly because of the limited depth in the dash. It comes with no instructions, which kind of makes sense since it's made to fit so many different cars. It works like this:1) break all the pieces apart.2) find some combination of pieces that will work through much trial and error.3) cut away the tabs and trim other plastic that keeps it from fitting.4) screw and glue the whole mess into the dash.5) enjoy."
3,So so,"Got this for an aftermarket CD/Stereo in our 2008 Chevy Trailblazer. It worked in the end but was not a ""great fit"". It's a little too universal... After some tweaking, shimming, and prying, we made it work. But if you are looking for an exact fit this is not it. If your dash has rounded corners this looks awkward and is hard to make it blend in. Not sure if there is a more vehicle specific kit out there, we bought the first cheapest one we found. If your crazy picky like we are, keep shopping! :)"
4,Netware 5 Administration - Made Easy,This text is well laid out and gives the students numerous examples and practice questions to help them with the concepts in Netware 5 Administration. The labs associated with the chapters were very easy for the students to implement. They provided the necessary hands-on practice which is crucial to the understanding of NDS. I would recommend this text to anyone who is endeavouring to teach Netware5 Administration.A well thought out text!
4,Finally found them!,"Maybe it's a local thing, but I haven't been able to find this size vacuum cleaner bag for quite a few years around here. And the ones I found that were close were way too expensive! What more could I ask for--perfect fit and really cheap!"
5,Great Product,These work perfectly and are cheaper than the ones I used to buy at the store. Will buy more!
5,Work Perfectly,I got these for my mom's old sharp ec-12tx3 upright and they work perfectly. She had been using the wrong bags for years without knowing it and she says it's the best it's worked since it was new. I highly recommend these bags if you have a sharp upright.
5,Easy to purchase,"It was so easy to purchase this item. I received my product in just a few days. It's getting more difficult to find vacuum bags in retail stores, now that everyone is going to ""bagless"" vacuums. Thanks."
5,A great fusion jazz album to have,"I first came across Kilauea by chance after a friend (who works as a purchasing manager in a music store) told me about this group. He wanted to get my opinion on it since I was the only one in the store that listened to jazz. The album was Tropical Pleasures and it was simply great. So when Spring Break came out, I thought, how much better can this be compared to the last one? Needless to say, it exceeded my expectations.... I used to be a Rippingtons fan but I have to say, they are now on my second most fav. list. I loved track 5, celebration of life"
1,Lil Jon has no talent!,"Lets gets something straight, Crunk is not music! Seriously lil jon needs to stop bitting off hip hop to pass off his garbage! Funny that no other genre would accept his idea but since lil jon tries to act gangsta, he gets accepted as a rapper,lol. Hip hop is all about the message,flow,nice beats,and most importantly the LYRICS!Lil jon doesn't possess ANY of these skills. Thanks to lil jon's stupidity he has created a new generation of music for retards that have an iq below the individuals shoe size.Take a nice look at soulja boy,perfect example.You can thank lil jon for inspiring that joke!P.S Don't support Lil Jon!"
1,What is this even called?,"Seriously, is there ANYONE who can tell me just what the hell this album is supposed to be called? *Sigh*, these idiots don't even know how to spell properly. Anyway, this album, by far, is probably the worst of all the Lil' John attrocities, which is saying a lot since Lil' John really is a horrible artist."
2,"Love the program, can't get it registered...","I've enjoyed using this software but every time I open it I'm informed I only have so many out of 20 or so times left to register. I've given them my email address, with no response. I've tried their website and received a key, typed it in, and still it gives me an error. I would give this a five-star rating if I thought I could use it beyond the specified trial period. It has a lot of fun features. I may just have to return it for my money back. Would rather not."
1,displeased,this dvd that i received had all movies that i had already seen - i already reviewed this and will not review again there should be some kind of a system that tells you what movies are in the sets
2,Needed subtitles,"I wanted to like this. I love watching mysteries, love Agatha Christie, and I love BBC. Having said all of that, I couldn't get into this. I couldn't understand everything that was being said, so I had to put closed captions on."
4,Skip the appointment...,"I watched ""Murder On The Orient Express"" when it first aired on television and was disappointed. I was far more impressed with it on second viewing. My opinion of ""Appointment With Death"" has not changed however. It is ruined by an incesant, droneing music score that distracts from, and obliterates much of the dialogue. I guess the idea was to fill the Syrian desert with noise! What a racket! I thought ""Third Girl"" was well done."
2,Agatha Christie's Poirot: Set 5,"As they became available, my husband and I purchased seasons one through four of the Poirot mysteries starring David Suchet. We enjoyed these so much that we looked forward to the recently released season five which includes Third Girl, Murder on the Orient Express, and Appointment with Death. We were very disappointed. Had these three been our introduction to the Poirot mysteries, we would not have acquired any of the others. The producers of these latests stories took free rein in adding and changing characters and plots which did not in any way improve on Agatha Christie's original stories. Additionally, Poirot now appears bitter and self-righteous and without any of the charm and humor we so admired in previous collections."
1,Dark!,"I own literally every Poirot DVD starring David Suchet. I was so excited to see that 3 more DVD's were available to view with him portraying Poirot. I, sadly, watched the set once and will probably not do so again. Why? The stories were quite ""dark"" and with such an intensity that it made me uncomfortable. I didn't enjoy watching. I felt relief when it was over, so I could relax...the only problem was how to get the images and sounds out of my head! Also, I was saddened by the difference in the Poirot portrayal. This Poirot is not ""jolly"" in any sense of the word; he is barely likeable and in some place is NOT likeable; he is deeply intense. Don't expect any of the smiles you have during the other DVD's at the foibles in Poirot's character. Disappointing."
5,Astounding Performances,"Alike many others who have felt that this set of Poirot films takes liberties from the actual stories, I believe they are yet self-containing of themselves in light of their alterations. Each film is a cinematic achievement and the actors have performed astoundingly with style. In addition to a beautifully crafted film series, they also feature breath-holding scores. As a student of music, I must say, with reference to Appointment with Death, that I am impressed with a sweeping symphonic score being countered at the same time with sounds of Mid-Eastern percussion. All in all, these film scores helped to make these films what they are. I usually don't watch a film more than once, but this film set has reached itself near the top of my films to see again, and soon."
5,p3,"What can i say about poirot, he is deffently the best of agatha christie, I am currently buying all i can get. i have seen them all and now want to own them. wife loves him and so does her sister. u won't be disappointed."
3,Too many changes,"Wish these directors/producers would stop ""modernizing"" these movies and leave them the way Christie wrote them. ""Murder on the Orient Express"" had scenes that were never in the book and the actors for the most part were boring and Poirot himself was rather odd. ""Third Girl"" was the old Poirot, and the third movie was not all that great. Go back to the old format and plots!"
4,"Agatha Christie's Poirot, Movie Collection Set 5","With great anticipation, I viewed ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and was rather dissappointed with the production. David Suchet's portrayal of Poirot was so superior to Albert Finney's Poirot, but the undertone of the entire movie was dissappointing. Perhaps the 1974 film has a better ensemble cast than the David Suchet's cast. The real gem of this disk was the tour on the Orient Express by David Suchet.Next, the ""Third Girl"" was marvelous and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and wished that the movie was longer. David Suchet was excellent.Enjoyed ""Appointment with Death"", but I kept thinking of Agatha Christie's other Poirot movie set in old Iraq at a archeology dig. The cast was enjoyable and added to the good production.All in all, this movie collection is a must for all Poirot fans. Must confess, I enjoyed Poirot best in his London flat with Miss Lemon, Lt. Japp and Capitan Hastings--aah the good old days!!!Suzanne S. Mycyk"
1,"HELP, have not recieved it yet way past deadline","help, have not received it yet, do not know where to go to tell you. WAY past deadline for this and #6. please let me know where it is, was suppose to be delived to mother for her birthday."
3,goodl stuff,"Murder on the Orient Express is interesting and a little different than prior versions. Appointment with death is a worth while story but the director goes weird with strange shots and music almost ruining the movie. Third Girl is the best of this set in my opinion and very enjoyable. But surprise, surprise, the most worth while part of this set is the special with Suchet making a trip on the real, restored Orient Express. I would buy this set for this special alone. Thanks."
1,Waiting for the price to approach reasonableness,"Seriously overpriced, $44 currently for just two movies in the series? I just don't understand that. I guess they are trying to cash in at the end of the series. I will place this in my Amazon Wish List and wait for its price to be slashed when nobody purchases it at its highly inflated price."
5,poirot pleasures,i love david suchet as the prissy little belgian inspector poirot. cosy english murder mysteries. i have his complete collection.
3,Original 1974 version is superb,The 1974 version of Murder on the Orient Express is a masterpiece and much better than the TV version.I am a die hard Christie fan. The costumes are georgeous and Ingrid Bergman won the Oscar for Best SupportingActress.
3,"Three ""new"" Christie stories","SIGH!! Sadly I have to agree with some of the reviewers about these three entries. First, the stories are not well adapted from the originals; second the direction and cinematography is dark and uneven to say the least; and third, even Poirot is presented in a different light -- not at all pleasant, and even Suchet seems a bit at odds with it. It just shows that a director/cinematographer can mess up a film even with the story laid out before them and an actor sublimely suited for the part. Watching Orient Express I had to admit the film with Albert Finney was superior; even considering the overblown ensemble cast. That being said, however, how can you not enjoy Suchet; and the special of him taking the actual orient express is really well worth the viewing."
1,Murder on the Orient Express,"My wife and I were so looking forward to seeing David Suchet play Poirot in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" but this is a huge disappointment! I don't know who had him play Poirot as a dark, cold, unsympathetic and self-righteous person, but it was a mistake.My wife and I have watched every Poirot many times and the way he was played in this makes it a real drag to watch. Frankly, not worth watching again.I hope in future movies he returns to the Poirot we know and love!!!!"
4,Poirot the Movie Collection,"As a lifelong Agatha Christie fan, I enjoyed each video. However, the storylines were ""dark"" compared to previous episodes. I was disappointed that Hastings was not featured in the Movie Collection. He made the stories more interesting and was a great addition to every episode. Perhaps, the murder's seemed more sinister and dark because Hastings was missing."
2,Major Disappointment,"I have loved the Suchet Poirots to date but this season was a major disappointment. These were not even in the spirit of the books. Where did all this gratuitous religion come from? Never saw it in Christie's books, other than the traditional vicar character. Poirot is dark, miserable,seemingly physically in pain, and preachy. He may have always been a bit pompous but lovably so. This version makes him almost evil in his grimness. The documentary on the Orient Express and filming of all are lovely.Zoe Wanamaker is a delight. The stories, however, are jerky and often illogical, not something that the author would have done. Christie would be rolling in her grave over these."
2,poirot 5,DIDN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL - far inferior to the Peter Ustinov versions. Agatha Christie's original plots were twisted into quite unbelieveable and complicated conclusions - even different murderers in one case. Why tinker with beloved and superbly rendered plots??
5,Just amazing!,"the music played by this 3 masters is just amazing, every riff, every note, every strike of the drums you just will enjoy it, I'm a professional drummer and having this cd is a great help in developing my playing! A must have"
3,GREAT,In Truth Its A Little Hard To Apply.....But For Those Looking For Hair Dye With Thickener Its OK.Recommended.Indiana ED
5,review for spray on hair color,This product was for my brother.He was verry satisfied wioth the price and how fast he received his merchandise.He would definately by from seller again.
4,Covers Gray,"Excellent, inexpensive daily use product to cover gray, and/or thin spots.Shop around, as prices go from $4 to $16/ unit."
2,Messy and Stinky,"I've used just about every hair thickener, and this is not my favorite. The price is fantastic, but the smell was too strong and gross. The sprayer was very messy and would spray more than my hair. I highly recommend My Secret Hair Enhancer or Fullmore (by Spencer Forrest). Both are quality cans at great prices."
3,Pros and Cons and Warnings for this product!,"I bought this on ebay because it was cheaper with shipping and all......Beware of breathing it in! I have a cold and just tried this for the first time tonight and everytime I blow my nose I can see this stuff on the tissues! I can't believe how much of it I breathed in!Pros: Let me just say that it makes me look great and have confidence.Cons: The stuff gets in the air all over, then it lands on the floor, a little on the walls sometimes, and all over the sink or bathtub. It gets all over your shoulders and it sprays out at too high of a pressure too fast. Cleanup is a lot of work and time consuming.Overall, It looks great but its a pain! I will only use it when I'm going somewhere important."
1,Don't buy this product :(,"What a waste of money. I don't have much hair & thought it would do the trick & fill in the bare spots. Well it did, but it's so messy and when you spray it on, it's almost like paint & spray everywhere as well. Do yourself a favor & save your money for something much better."
3,HAIR COLOR SPRAY,"IT COVERS NICELY, HOWEVER YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU SPRAY BECAUSE IT COMES OUT FAST AND I FOUND MYSELF WIPING A LOT OFF."
1,Sucks,This product sucks. It feels terrible in your hair and you can't style after it dries. It took forever to wash out and made a mess every where. My advice DON'T BUY IT.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I have been ordering this product for years now and I have always been very pleased with the results. For some reason,however, this latest purchase is not very satisfactory. I'm not sure if I just happen to get a faulty batch of hairspray or if they changed the product somewhat. This time the spray is more messy than usual. It is coming out very thick and clumpy. In the past, it always came out in a moderate spray and was easier to apply. When I shake the cans there is a rattling noise and I'm not sure if that has something to do with it. Any suggestions? Thank you."
5,hair color,product does what it states. Its is simple to apply and could not find any other store selling this product in Hawaii.
2,Humm not sure,"Well, I am 29 and about a year ago I had begun to loose some hair in the front of my scalp and had been panicking about it, so, I thought what the heck let me see if this product works. I have to admit that I have only tried it twice, and the reason being is that this spray is VERY MESSY and will also paint your face if your not careful. Also, I dont recommend anyone using it on a hot day, where you may be prone to sweating because if you do sweat, you better run to a bathroom to either wash it off or you will look rediculous with color all over your face. Conversely, I think maybe this spray may work better if your using it during the winter , or when it's not rainaing because it will look like your bleading on your head black paint."
3,decent,"It looks great at first, but as soon as you sweat from your forehead it tends to run. If you want a better product try GLH formula 9 from Ronco. That stuff really stays in. All and I all I was satisfied with this product though, it looked as if I had a full head of hair and no one was the wiser. By the by. If it's hot where you live keep the product with you also a tissue in case it starts to run. You don't want a stained forehead!"
4,Good value,"I have been looking for a product that does this as I've had thinning hair for about 5 years. I found one (Bumble and Bumble hair powder), but it was $35 and I couldn't keep buying it. This does the same thing for much less. I bought one to try, then bought 4 to save on shipping. Until the research can provide a better solution, this makes me not feel self-conscious when i'm out in public. I do keep my fingernails painted, just in case I itch my head, because it is difficult to get out from under my nails until i'm at home with a nail brush."
4,cover up,This product will cover bald spots and it does thicken your hair. It does not feel too good to the touch when on your hair and it is kinda like hair spray. It washes out nicely. Sometimes it will leave color on pillow when you sleep. I thought it was worth it though because it does what it is expected to do. I thought it was a worthwhile purchase.
5,spray hair color,"Worked just as promised, just have to be careful not to get color on clothing or ears."
1,Don't bother,"This is a product that truly lives down to its reputation. Never mind that it stinks (and not in a suitably masculine way) and is runny, the spray comes out with such force that you might want to apply it in the shower so you can rinse down the walls afterward.What a huge disappointment.Worse, the retailer won't let me return the five unopened cans, so I'm stuck with six of these smelly things."
2,Not the best thing to use!,I've used this quite a bit in the past because I didn't know what else to use. I have found something now that is much better. This sprays too hard and also leaves a residue on surrounding areas.
3,Jerome Russell Hair Spray,It does a good job for its purpose and cost . It also can be very messy and gets on clothing and pillows and runs easily if you get wet or sweat. After applying I use hair spray on it then a blow dryer to dry it and that helps alot.
4,"Good, but wish they lasted longer",My son uses these to sleep at night. They work well but wear out after a half-dozen uses. But that's probably the just a natural limitation of the type of material it's made of. Definitely work way better than foam for our purposes.
5,Perfect for light sleepers and swimmers!,"I'm a pretty light sleeper, so I take these earplugs on every trip I go to and I keep them next to my bed for those rare occasions when my roommate feels the need to do her laundry at 2am. These earplugs block all of the noise so I can sleep and they're actually pretty comfortable. Also, I love taking a hot bath at the end of the day and submerging my head underwater to wash away all my stress. These work perfectly to keep the water out."
3,Would work well if kid would leave alone,These earplugs are a little hard to push out in a child's ear. Child knows they are there & wants to play with them. Our 4 year old son thought they were small pieces of playdoo and refuses to wear them.
5,the best most economical hands down,"i have been buying these ear plugs for my child who is now seven and has had ear tubes since she was three. needless to say, we have spent a fortune on earplugs in the last four years buying them at drug stores and the like where they can be anywhere between 2 and five dollars a package. these were about $1.50 per package and with no sales tax and free shipping, i felt like a dummy for not discovering them much sooner. they work great and have saved us from probably multiple ear infections. thanks amazon for pricing these so fairly!"
5,Second Sight - Dr Judith Orloff,"After receiving a newsletter from Caroline Myss in which she discussed the above book, I ordered Second Sight through Amazon as it is not available in South Africa. It is well worth reading. The advice offered makes sense and makes me understand why I have felt for so long that the medical profession is ""way off track"" these days - it is essential for us to understand that in order to heal, our mental attitude is all important and in general doctors need to look at the holistic approach to curing. I am now reading Guide to Intuitive Healing which I have not doubt will be as good in the advice offered. Thank you Dr Orloff."
5,Second Sight,"I have read well over 100 books on psychic instruction and develoment. I was so impressed with Second Sight by Dr. Judith Orloff that I had to take a minute and write this review....something I have never done before.While I am very interested in this subject, I must also say that Dr. Orloff's style is just perfect. She is honest and genuine. A true delight. Dr. Orloff is not afraid to share her deepest private thoughts. I have actually purchaed extra copies of this book and sent them to people I knew would appreciate them.I will soon purchase another one of her books."
5,Integrating Psychic and Analytical Abilities,"In Second Sight, Judith Orloff, using her own experience, describes so well what it's like to come to terms with innate psychic abilities when we live in a predominately analytical, scientific world. The relief and freedom that comes with acceptance of a hidden part of our nature, and finding that this part of us is useful, opens up a new world in which we feel so much more alive. Even though I've written my own book on this topic, I still feel relief and comfort when I read about others who are healing this left-brain, right-brain split and integrating the capacities of each into their lives. If you are struggling with this issue, you'll find Dr. Orloff's book inspiring."
5,An answer to years of searching!,"I was made aware of Dr. Orloff through a website link, I immediately felt a connection to what she was stating. I found Second Sight to be personal and informative. I really liked the way the book is divided into sections, the first half on her life and the second on ways to use your intuition. After years of wondering if things I felt and sensed were normal,SecondSight provided the answers I was unable to find anywhere else. The book also gives specific exercises to use to further develop your skills. A great book for anyone who wants to learn more about Intuition, Dreams and Healing yourself."
5,Insightful - inspirational - well balanced.,"I truly gained very valuable insight into the world of the paranormal by reading this book - Second Sight is written with a very methodological/scientific bent, making it difficult to doubt Orloff's personal stories and professional advise. Her retelling of her participation in a wide array of scientific studies is fascinating. I would recommend this book to those just exploring the world of the psychic as well as those deeply invested in that world."
4,"Accecpting Myself, Accecpting Others","The only reason I rated the book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would have liked to have had more in the way of learning how to be more of a psychic. For instance in seeing auras in the colors she spoke of. I have had psychic experiences, and have been laughed at, so, in the past, did not speak very much about it. I hope that more open minded parents, educators, relatives, etc., will encourage children to build their skills and not squash them."
3,This book leans heavily toward religion toward the end.,"The more I got into this book, the more I tended to doubt the credentials and the credulity of this young psychiatrist. Like ""The Road Less Travelled, it led you on with words of wisdom and food for thought, but kept on going toward meditation, prayer and religion"
4,Psychic and Intuitive Healing,I usually listen to my books in the car going to and from work. I feel that there is so much to read and so little time. Not a new idea but quite practical. I really enjoyed Dr. Orloff and her discussion of working at the never ending task of attempting to meld her psychic abilities with her obvious medical/professional training. I guess the word that best describes this author and her ideas is more than informative ... she moves right into captivating. It opens the old grey matter for new ideas and concepts. Quite good and I recommend it for everyone.Bob L.
5,The Greatest,Other than Augustus Pablo produced stuff this is probably my favourite dub album of all time. Every track is classic. Brilliant dubs largely of Barrington Levy's fantastic Englishmen/ Robin Hood era. $200 is very pricey. Thankfully I have it on vinyl.
5,A perfect read,"I never thought I would have read a book set back in the 1800s, and loved it. It was such a welcome change from what I usually read. I liked how the relationship developed between the two leads and it didn't feel rushed to me. The two (sort of) love triangles kept me wondering who was going to end up with whom. This is a book I will buy and add to my growing home library, so I can read it again."
1,I didn't get it,"I didn't get my book... do not buy from this dealer, or you won't get it. The money was taken out of my account & I did not recieve a book. So either I deserve an explanation, or this dealer is a thief & I warn you to not buy from them."
3,Pretty good,Charles solomon makes the best Will Spanner IMO.This has what you expect from the series nudity and cheesy special effects which is in part why I like it.I have the whole series minus part 13 which I can't find yet.If your a fan of WC this is one of the best ones.
4,Interesting Era For Quo,"This is an interesting collection of songs when the band was new.They hit it big with some early hits, and there is a few hard to get songs here.Great Cd this.Some of these songs are very good although some may sound outdated.I like this era of the band though,they produced alot of good songs."
2,"Ok, but limited use","The actual functionality of the product is pretty good.But, it is limited to use with Internet Explorer requiring installing a custom component, so if you want to access it remotely forget about seeing it with your iPhone. I suspect most cell phones won't work either. We contacted customer service to ask if there is a way to set it up for other browsers/devices and never got an answer.Also, if you want to set up multiple cameras to feed thru your home network to view remotely, you'll need a separate server ($$$) that can handle that."
5,A fun way to use up your scraps,"If you have scraps left over from your various projects, this book is for you! Turn those scraps into a works of art. These patterns are great for fun quilts for everyone."
3,Looks like a good quilting book - but haven't used it enough yet to give it a accurate rating.,I haven't really used this book enough to do a rating - preliminary review is good. Hoping to use it in the future.
1,"A fascinating subject, a disappointing book","What a great subject Thelma Todd is for a book, and what a shame that this author missed the opportunity she had to write a really good biography. Invented dialogue between Thelma and other people, and the author's undocumented speculations ruin Edmonds' credibility. She missed chance after chance to tell us what made Thelma special, onscreen and off. Her film work, both in features and short subjects (which can now be seen on Odyssey's Leonard Maltin Presents series) are never explored to any degree - but then this author is only interested in the sensational angles of Thelma's life, which sold the book idea in the first place, I'm sure. Sadly, this IS the one biography out there on Thelma. Someday, a legitimate film historian will interest a company such as McFarland or Scarecrow and this unfortunate book will be forgotten."

2,SEQUEL?,"Face it people, this is not T2 or The Godfather Part II, and why is there a sequel to the hitcher anyway? The first ""The Hitcher"" was a classic movie which was a perfect reimagining of Steven Speilberg's classic DUEL. There was no need for a sequel. The story was told, nothing more to tell. A sequel? Dragonheart fell victim for this. A sequel will just tell the story all over again. Not even C. Thomas Howell could save this movie from being a failure. All in all, not entertaining and unnecessary. Not recomended."
1,Disappointing Sequel,"I cannot rate this movie without comparing it with The Hitcher, since the reason I bought it was because I am a fan of the original movie. The best thing about the first movie was the suspense and the excellent acting by both C. Thomas Howell and Hauser. This second movie is a bad rehash of the first with a lot of action and no suspense at all. There are even repeated scenes; this makes this movie a totally predictable one. The villain this time is not as mysterious as the first one and the easy way in which he escapes one time after the other is very hard to believe, as is the stupidity of everyone from the police to the new hero. C. Thomas Howell did an excellent job with the very limited part assigned to him, but this is simply a mediocre movie."
1,Really doesn't even deserve one star....,"Oh GEE...I can't imagine WHY this movie went straight to DVD. Really pathetic, lacks everything that made the first so good. Go for a walk instead of watching this."
4,rotti,"ordered for a friend that likes scary movies, She likes the movie. The condition was excellent would order again from this seller."
3,Decent flick,"Just finished watching The Hitcher II on DVD. I give it *** out of fivestars.Good homage to the original.What I liked about it:Kari Wuhrer - always solid. She almost made me like Sliders. Almost.Jake Busey - I was afraid he would give the same over-the-top performance asin The Frighteners. Instead he was very subdued. He's no Rutger Hauer but hecame close to some of his daddy's more subdued roles.It didn't try to be more than it was. Just a homage, not really a sequel tothe great original film. Didn't over reach itself.What I didn't like about it:C. Thomas Howell - had a really poorly written role. I didn't mind themturning the story over to Kari, but expected more maturety and selfconfidence out of Howell's role after the way he had grown in the firstfilm. To have him scarred was fine but to have him afraid was out ofcharacter."
3,Only Rutger Hauer can be The Hitcher,"Im a big fan of the original. It's hard to follow in the steps of a classic like THE HITCHER, especially with Rutger Hauer in the lead role. And it is exactly because Hauer is not in this one that I cant give it more than 3 stars. It tries too hard to be as good as the original and Jake Bussey has been given an impossible job of trying to be as menacing a character as the memorable John Ryder played by Hauer. And as for C. Thomas Howell? [Darn], I thought his character would be in a mental ward for the rest of his life after what he went through. Still, its worth a look. Maybe rent before buying. Cheers."
1,DONT HITCH ON TO THIS,"In the first movie, a young Jim Halsey is taking a trip across the southwest to see his brother. He picks up a hitchhiker and he turned out to be evil. In some twisted way he looked at Jim as a son while he murdered person after person and framed Jim for it. The first movie, after time, picked up an audience and somewhat of a cult following. In number two, the hitcher is played by a different actor. If you believe the title""Ive been waiting"" its supposed to be the same guy but C. Thomas Howell doesnt reconize him when they meet.(go fiqure) After this point its basically a re-make of the first movie with no orginal ideas at all. For some reason, Jim is killed about halfway through the movie so his wife must battle the Hitcher which im afraid to say is real unbeliveable. Kari Whurer is beautiful but, I found it hard to belive her in this role. Get the first movie if you want to be entertained, get this movie for insomnia."
2,Lousy sequel to the original,This straight to video fim cannot compare to the 1st-which was a classic with Roger Hauer-Jake Bussey (son of Gary Bussey) is just like his father-a typical B movie actor with limited range and acting ability. He was not at all scary-he was just too predictable. The movie did not explain the connection between Busey and Hauer (from the original) - and I thought that was a major part missing-C Thomas Howell is a great B movie actor and is fit for movies like this but---he was killed off way too early in this film and from that time on the film kind of went down hill after that. Rent it-bring it back to the store and forget it. I would like to get a hold of the special edition of the Hitcher that the reviewer from LA spoke of.
1,Sprawling grace,"I saw this on CNBC on the 29 August 2011. It was just the right time to see how stupid this idea of rebuilding the cities. Hurricane Irene is a good reason for not living in one of these awful rat filled cities. You can't escape. No one in their right mind would live in these over populated areas, only sheepeople."
5,Right book for the Job,This item arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition with a reasonable price.
1,"Snake Oil, anyone?",To put a price tag of $80 on a couple of tree spikes makes me wonder. You can get these at Home Depot for about 40 Cents each. Big discount!
2,Back of Box,"Ex-Cop Sam Kellog (Saxon) works harder than most for his money, he is a professional bounty hunter. He stalks losers, human trash, punks, pimps and hookers. But it's a job...a Hell of a job. His last three assignments have been small change and Kellog is up to his neck in debt. His latest assignment is to bring in an ex-con, a man the prison guards used as the guinea pig for a new weapon called The Glove. Victor (Rosey Grier), the ex-con, has a score to settle and he leaves in his wake a score of bloody guards. Kellog hits the streets only to meet the biggest challenge of his life: 250 pounds of the biggest, meanest, angriest black man alive. It's a job a Hell of job.The Glove, 1983 a film directed by Ross Hagen, starring John Saxon, Rosey Grier, Joan Blondell Wanted Dead Not Alive"

4,7-Day Quick Weight-Off Diet,I'm in the process of using the diet plan so far so good. I was really surprised that the book I purchased was considered used. It is in perfect like new condition. The information in the book is really informative. I'm really glad I purchased it!
3,DVD/CD ROM,"My DVD/CD ROM doesn't work normally. Whenever I see a DVD movie, the image is ok but the sound skips or misses in some part. I tried to contact the help desk but it didn't work. I guess I just forget that I do have DVD/CD ROM though because it's really irritating when the sound keep skipping."
1,Worst laptop ever,"sound disturbance, restarts with our wanrning, got problem with mother board 4 times in 2 years, needed to change hard drive 2 times,needed to change the DVD drive.i bought this laptop with COMPUSA and all the products i brought with them sucks. lucky that i took insurance with the laptop for 3 years so i am making use of if, but most of the time it stays with the service people as it gives problems every month."
4,Majesty's wafers,"The Majesty's HA wafers are helpful for my horses, especially the one with arthritis. I also use the Majesty's Buddy Bites for my dog with arthritis."
2,Misrepresnted,Bouth this item after reading the product description that it had 20 preset stations for the radio 10AM and 10FM.Imagine my suprise whne i recieved item opened it and found it to be a manual tuning knob instead of preset buttons.never would have purchased this itme had it been accurately describe.It is what it is a low priced bare essential boombox.And should be more accuraetly describe as that.took me 2 minutes t9o realize was a poor purchase boxed it up and returned it.
5,versatile music machine,"This boombox does what I wanted: I can copy CDs onto blank cassette tapes so that I can easily play them in my car (no cd player in my older car!). Also able to play from my large collection of aging tapes--hate to have all those goldie-oldies unavailable to me. The sound quality is good and all buttons user-friendly. I can also play CDs that I have created on it without problems. The copy says it ships ""from Amazon"" but it arrived in a rather beat-up flimsy plain brown box. It was protected with air bags and was OK, but the packaging could have been a little stronger."
2,Don't waste your money,"I ordered this boombox based on the reviews listed here. It arrived in its original box that was all beat up and had two holes in it and only one side of the box was taped. I knew when I opened the box the CD player would be damaged, but was surprised it wasn't. Then I played a CD and was terribly disappointed in the quality of the sound. It has absolutely no bass. I compared it to another CD player I have and there was no comparison. The speakers just have no bass at all. After listening to the cd player for 5 minutes or so I had to turn it off, because I just couldn't stand the tinny noise. This is the first time I have returned anything to Amazon and the whole process went well."
5,Best bluegrass cd of 2001,"I can't take Kane's River out of my cd player! We got this cd last year for Christmas and have since bought several copies to give to friends and family. Outstanding vocals and instrumentation, interesting arrangements and extraordinary original material. An absolute must for the collection of any fan of great music. Great bluegrass/Americana with a refreshing twist. Highly recommended!"
1,Boring,"Just like her second and last recording, there is a similitude to this performer's approach. The songs are almost uniform in that there is no excitement in the recordings and little passion comes across in the interpretation of the lyric. I hope that she does not bother to make a third recording."
4,Pretty good,Put them in some of my thinner/harder-soled shes to ease the impact on my knee. They do help (although I was hoping for something a little bit thicker)... I would buy again.
3,Not as cushiony as expected,"I tried these on at a local shop when I was looking to replace the disintegrated insoles in myDr. Scholl's Women's Jamie Lace-Upshoes. In the end, the choice was between this insole, and theSof Sole Women's Arch Support and Cushion Insole. I chose the other insole because though the visible thickness of the forefoot was the same, the solid foam forefoot of the other insole was much more cushiony and comfortable than the gel forefoot of this insole. (The arch also seemed a tiny bit higher.)The gel on this insole is actually pretty hard. It does not provide much padding, cushion, or shock absorption. The only reason I can think of to choose this over theSof Sole Women's Arch Support and Cushion Insoleis if one had a very very flat foot. You would still probably find the other insole more comfortable."
2,Too thick,"Too thick to make shoes comfortable. It makes my feet sit too high in the shoe and slip out. Tried loosening laces. Perhaps these would be best for a favorite, old pair of shoes which have lost all of thier support."
1,I am a High School Physics Teacher...,"... and these dvds are terrible. All these videos do is read equations to the viewer. Students have a book for that. I was hoping for experiments, fun examples of physical concepts in everyday life, etc., but there was none of this. As a teacher intent on instilling excitement in my students, it is painful for me to watch. Even I got bored and mind-numb after only a few minutes. Don't do this to your students! This video reinforces the notion that physics is only a bunch of equations you have to memorize. I don't believe they did this."
4,Down Time,I definitely think the videos could be more exciting. But if you are really trying to learn physics and are studying on your own. These tapes are a good way to spend your down time away from books and problems. You pick up little nuances that you may not see by staring at a bunch of words in a book.
3,Virginian Season 3,"Having enjoyed the first two seasons of this series, we thought it would be fun to continue. And while it's still wholesome fun from yesterday, I can't help but wonder what was going on with the actors.. Lee J. Cobb is probably only featured in 3 episodes for less than 10 minutes. It seems that just one of the featured cast will 'carry' the entire show. If Virginian is the featured character, you won't see Judge Garth, Trampas, or Betsy. If Trampas is the guy, everyone else is absent. Makes me wonder if they thought they were getting famous enough to negotiate easy schedules!! Still worthwhile, just don't expect it to be like the first season where everyone was involved and included."
5,Great,The Virginian - The Complete Third Season - Special Embossed Tin - 1Go glad I purchased this video for my Western video collection. Always looking for more.
4,virginian 3,I like how it comes in a can but to be honest I haven't watched it as of yet. So I can't really give it a perfect number. I do like the series however and like just the first few seasons.
5,The Virginian Third Season,I think i have all the seasons on DVD now and they are brilliant. George Robertson.I got them all from Amazon.com.
4,Good mixing bowl,"Good large size mixing bowl, better suited to the electric mixer than other mixing chores because it is so deep. I'd prefer a wider shallower bowl for tossing salad, hand mixing of bread or meatloaf."
3,"Not heavy, but serviceable",It's a stainless mixing bowl - sort of thin gauge - but serviceable. About the right size for mixing Martha White and Duncan Hines dessert mixes before baking. I also bought the 4 quart heavier stainless steel mixing bowl - made by a different company- which I prefer.I liked the 4 quart so much I ordered 2 more to give as gifts. I'm beginning to use the 4 quart over the 3 quart - doesn't seem to spill out as easily as the 3 quart.
4,Just what I needed,"Better than buying a double boiler. This fits nicely on my 3 quart saucepan, for at least $20 cheaper. I thought it was quite the deal."
1,Alright Item,"What can I say., it's stainless steel., but not all that great of a product. Service was fast..I bought a similar item from K-Mart that was absolutely the best. Non-slip rubber bottom and heavy gauge stainless. Not what I got from the above seller...."
2,Avoid this one,"My overwhelming feeling upon trying to read this book (I couldn't bring myself to finish it) was sorrow that such a great idea for a book was executed so poorly. I had hoped for a cynical look at the idiocy that finds a home in so many large organizations, something along the lines of ""The Devil's Dictionary"" or something. Although this was clearly the intent, the reality falls short of the mark.First off, the book is infuriatingly poorly written. It is rife with misspellings, bizarrely worded sentences, and endless repetition. Even the physical quality of the book was poor - it had a wrinkled cover and sections started falling out before I'd read fifty pages.Still, the concept is excellent. I wonder what a good editor could have done with it...."
1,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this helmet. When I removed it from the box I notice how distorted the visor was - it is made of a vinyl plastic, rather than an ABS which would make it ridged. This flexibility also allowed for the face section to distort, flatten out, looking nothing like it does in the photo. The lens shield was of poor quality and framed with material to secure it, but this also restricted the view. However, if this is your only option, as it was mine, for a reasonably priced collectible than go for it."
4,Great project helmet,"This helmet is made with very dense vinyl. About 1/4 inch thick. Its not flimsy or anything. The only problem is the visor isn't attached to the mask on the sides, causing it to flare out. This distortion can easily be fixed by adding support bars, and securing the visor to the mask. So if you looking for something to go trooping in, this is not it, unless heavy modification is done. Otherwise, great product!"
1,STAY AWAY !!!!,THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE LOOKS LIKE SOOOOOOOOOOO RIPPED OFF. i will never by another rubies product again. im so disapointed! i wont even try to reseel this it is that bad. the people who made this should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of online shoppers. THe face on this thing is flat and looks like a bad art project.
2,Disappointing,Item states it is a helmet for adults. Will not fit an adult. So sorry a better comment could not be made.
2,"Bent, warped and huge!","I was really disappointed with this helmet, the picture sure was different to what actually arrived. There was a massive dent in the side which is not repairable, the shape is oblong and, if this is aimed at kids, the size is way too big. The Storm Trooper, TIE pilot and Vader were excellent and I always enjoy looking at them and get great comments when friends see them on display. The Scout helmet looks like i tried to build it myself.Don't bother"
1,Fire in the Heart,"As this was a gift and I have forwarded your request on to the recipient, I am sorry to say she has not replied. Therefore, I can only assume she was not disappointed or she would have commented. Sorry this took a while."
5,"WOULD HAVE RATED THIS 100 STARS MY FAVORITE BOOK, PERIOD.","Why do they not make more books like this!!! I read this and I immediately said that I was not interested, but I gave it a try. O MY GOSH!!! THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!! I was so surprised at the plot of the story. If you look at it really closely, you find that it is a life/death story in Jez being captured and being brought out of the spell. I liked how he allowed himself to become light. It reminds me of how no-one is afraid of the light, but everyome is afraid of the dark. It was a great story that gave me the message of love and redemption. Finn is so caring for his friends and his mom and dad. I'm so reading the second book. Another thing is I plow through books, so this was a good seris start off for me. I would recommend this book to anyone who picks it up in interest."
4,Do Yourself A Favor!,I love Ridley Pearson's KK series so much! I'm well over my tween years and I am a huge fan of Disney and Pearson and those two combined made for a great seven part series. The books are filled with adventure in a memorable place and bring into play some of your favorite Disney creations. The action is appropriate and the story is challenging for young mystery/thriller readers. The first book takes place in the Magic Kingdom and whenever I read it I automatically imagine myself there. Your favorite scenes may be in the castle or on Main Street or (mine) Splash Mountain! There are new villains running around and we want to stop them!The publisher did a smart thing with the new covers: they made them bold and interesting. Something people will stop and look at. So please do your kids or yourself a favor: buy a copy!
2,Can't get past the bad writing,"Such an interesting idea, but so poorly written that neither I nor my 10yo daughter made it more than 50 pages or so. It may be written for more of a 7 year old level."
3,For younger readers,"This was a good book, however; it is very juvenile. I was looking for an adventure series similar to the hunger games and typed that in the search and this series came up. This is nothing like the Hunger games. Would recommend for 3/4 graders."
2,For adolescents,"This audio book just drags on and on, and I had to quit reading it. Its really for kids ages 9 to about 12 years old. The conversations are about at the reading level of a 5th grader. Good concept, I wish it were better. Again its really for kids !"
2,Only ONE Disney character in the book!!!!,"I was disappointed in this book. The summary is VERY misleading: it says ""Five young teens...find themselves pitted against Disney villains..."" Villains - that's PLURAL. Based on that, I thought the book would be about the kids meeting lots of Disney characters, or at least facing the Disney Villains. But no - the ONLY Disney character they meet in the entire book is Maleficent. That's it. The stuff about the rides was interesting, but I was very disappointed that aside from Maleficent, there were NO Disney characters in it at all. (Oh, in chapter 1 a kid sees Goofy and Chip and Dale walk by, but that's all - he doesn't speak to them, and he sees no other characters in the rest of the book.)"
5,Disney after dark,Package arrived on time and in good shape . Book appears new and unused . This is Number one in the series.
5,cittycat,"This series was suggested to me by a young woman.Kingdom Keepers: Disney After Dark (The Kingdom Keepers)This is Book one in a series of ""books"" set in Disney World. Even though this book is written for tweens and young teens it has enough action, mystery and excitement to interest an older reader. As a sixty year old reader, I enjoyed the book on many levels. One, it is a wholesome book that has absolutely no foul language or thoughts; two, it is a great mystery and three it is written for today's youth. It is full of up to date and futuristic story lines that really draws the reader in and holds their attention. Whether you are young or just young at heart, this is a great book! Can't wait to complete the series..."
5,Love This Book!,"I received The Kingdom Keepers as a gift, and found it interesting, so I went ahead and read it. By the time I was finished I was in love with this book. It was confusing in some parts, even when I reread the entire series, and some questions are not answered until the sequel. But overall, it is one of my favorite books. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, fantasy, and Disney World! Enjoy!"
3,Extended Commercial,"""The Kingdom Keepers"" has an interesting premise, and I give it three stars for being a mildly entertaining read. Unlike other reviewers, I found the focus on the geographical and architectural details of the parks interesting. The book's biggest shortcoming is its narrative choppiness, and it all too often comes across as little more than an extended commercial for Walt Disney World."
2,"great book, quality not shipped as described",This was a great book to read!The people who advertised that this book was being shipped new/like new lied - many pages in the book were bent from previous reads and all of the corners on the cover were worn and rounded.
3,Awesome Review,This book is filled with fantasy and terror. This book will send chills down your spine. The Kingdom Keepers is about a boy named Fin. Fin has to defeat an evil witch named Maleficent. Then Fin keeps having these weird dreams. But that is only when he started working at the Disney park. Then in his dreams he meets a guy named Wane. That is all I have to say about the Kingdom Keepers.Henry C.
4,Good book,This book is very interesting and has lots of action. If you like Disneyland you'll probably like this book a lot!
4,The Kingdom Keepers,"This book is the first in a series of three. The setting is The Magic Kingdom part of Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Five young people about twelve or thirteen years of age,each of whom have taken part in an experimental program known as DHI technology, are involved in saving the Magic Kingdom from an evil group known as the Overtakers.This book has adventure, suspense, imagination, mystery and all the magic of Walt Disney's wonderful magical creations. It also contains some of the creative technology that is so a part of the world in which children now find themselves. It appeals, I think, to both boys and girls in the nine to eleven age group.Alma Winters, Author- Once Upon a Time Tales"
4,If you love DisneyWorld - this is a fun book,"I am a total Disney freak so when my daughter read this and said it was a good book set in DisneyWorld I had to read it!This was a cute book. The main characters are middle school students who have volunteered to have hologram images of themselves made as ""hosts"" in Magic Kingdom. But the technology has a more serious purpose than that - the battle of good magic over evil! (After all, this is Disney!) Overall I liked the variety of characters, the end brought a surprise I didn't anticipate, and it was an interesting premise. But, there are still questions that were not resolved - I am not sure if that is because you are supposed to continue reading the other stories, or if these questions were just left as loose ends. Overall, a quick, fun, easy book about one of my favorite topics!"
4,Speds 4th grade,"Kingdom Keepers by Ridley Pearson is a fascinating fantasy story about Finn Whitman and a group of Orlando teens who enter a world full of ' Disney '. The theme park is in great danger from a group called the Overtakers who are a group of evil Disney characters. Finn and his four friends work together to solve the riddle of The Stone Cutters Quill. This story is full of thrills and chills, tecnology, mystery, danger and adventure. Secrets will be revealed! This book is an entertaining read, but a tittle challenging if you have not been to Disney. By Erin, Cameron, Kelsey, Jake and Nick."
4,Fun Fun Fun,I really enjoyed this book. It started off a little slow but picked right up half way through. I believe it is a must read for all Disney fans who will recognize the different locations throughout the park - and who may never look at the park the same way again. Get it if you are interested and I don't think you will be disappointed! Can't wait for book 2!
5,Best Book,This book is probably the best book I've ever read. I've been to Disney World and I'm obsessed with the place. It is even more fun to read if you've been there because you can follow along with where they are in the story. The story was full of suspense and the characters were good. I really enjoyed it and could not put it down. I really hope that Ridley Pearson will write a sequel.
5,buy unless your stuiped,this book would be perfect for a person 9+. dont listen to bad reveiws cuz i read all the books and GARRUNTEE u will luv em
3,I REALLY wanted to like this book...,"I REALLY wanted to like this book. I bought it for my 12-yr-old daughter before a trip to Walt Disney World. It's an easy read for kids, but as an adult I found the story lacking and choppy. And the ending was abrupt leaving the door open for a sequel. Also, while there were a few, I was hoping for more Disney secrets and things to hunt for on our trip."
2,"poor language, attractive setting","The book is fun to read, but absolute pulp fiction for kids. Primitive action, poor language, flat characters. Nothing to provoke any thinking. The only thing that I liked about it: the real setting of the Magic Kingdom is fun to read about. I just think, that with such an imaginative idea, popular Disney characters, the author could find a much better implementation. I would still recommend it for the kids who likes adventures and want to read some ""lighter"" books."
5,A kid's review,"The book Kingdom Keepers by Ridley Pearson is a book I highly recommend you read. This book is filled with fantasy and terror that will send chills down you spine. The Kingdom Keepers is about a boy named Finn who has to defeat an evil witch maleficent. When he applies for a job at the Disney World park Magic Kingdom, he begins to have weird and sometimes terrifying dreams. In one of his dreams he meets a weird man named Wane. Finn thinks this dream is as fake as it gets, But Wane says this is all but real. Finn does not believe until a large black shadow runs by and makes chills run up his spine. Wane tells Finn that he has a destiny here in this world. Finn agrees to it but later he regrets it. Read the book to find out what happens.Steven A."
5,disney fun,No matter what your age if you are a Disney fan you will enjoy these books. They make you want to check the locations in the book out in the parks. They are simply written but can still be enjoyed by adults if you can suspend reality these books use imagination. Children from about 9 and up can read and enjoy these books as well. These books are a great thing for the whole family to read and share together.
5,AJC brobuscus,"This book was everything I love, Disney and Fantasy I love Disney world and Fantasy books a n d tobuscus"
4,If you love Disney...,"Reading this delightful story is like visiting Walt Disney World through the eyes of an exceptionally special child, a villain, and Walt himself. The descriptions put me back inside my favorite rides and had me wondering about all the behind the scenes areas I've never had the pleasure of visiting. It also kept my mouse ears a bit tilted as I pondered how I would interact with attractions gone astray and dark characters come to life. If only I could have a hologram version of myself and visit Disney after dark! If you love Disney and are in for a bit of an adventure then pick up this book and enjoy the ride. I'm looking forward to book two!"
5,Excellent Read,"I throughly enjoyed reading The Kingdom Keepers. As a kid, I spent many days exploring the Magic Kingdom and dreaming of the adventures that might have been. I will recommend this book to all my friends and family and their kids. As far as the strength of the story, it's excellent right up to the end... which I thought was a bit flat. Maleficent was pursueing Finn, her powers amplified, and yet she was contained by a fishing net and a jail cell? It felt a bit thin... otherwise the story was a real nail biter.Thank you Mr. Pearson for a thrilling tale and for reigniting some of those dreams of adventures past and future. I look forward to reading the next book in the series.Shannon"
5,Great Read!,Seriously has to be one of the most underrated series of books I have come across. I was so into the Peter and the Starcatchers series that I stumbled across this book. My wife and I read this book while she was pregnant every night wishing we were back at DisneyWorld. The story was a little hard to understand at first but once the first few chapters were done it was fast and furious afterwards. My wife and I absolutely enjoyed the book and look forward to Kingdom Keepers II: Disney and Dawn coming out in August. An absolute must for Disney lovers!
4,Very entertaining,"I read this to my son and both of us enjoyed it very much. Lots of imagination and a good story. Took away one star because it felt rushed in spots (not enough detail or description, which is actually refreshing, considering that so many writers put in too much...but still). Haven't read #2 yet, but we will."
1,SNORE,"Dan Barden is a great writer -- the dialogue flows beautifully. However, the story didn't move me at all. I'm a huge John Wayne fan and I figured: how could I be disappointed?? But I was...BIG TIME. ZZZZzzzzzz"
1,I agree with other readers,"I always like to give a book the benefit of the doubt. I'd heard some negative comments about this, but still was intrigued for some reasons that I've now forgotten. The book is excruciatingly dull, wholly without insight, terribly precious, badly written, and not worth any reader's time (especially the ones like me who adore John Wayne and John Ford and the entire canon.)"
1,READ (fiction) Hogwash,"It is ashame the way this book is written, most people who read it may forget, it is a work of ""FICTION"" and confuse it with the truth. It paints ""Duke"" as a crude overbearing tyrant. John Wayne was human and I am sure had his faults, why exaggerate them and run down a man who gave the young and old of this country something to live up to"
2,LOVE THE DUKE...DIDN'T LOVE THE BOOK,"Dan Barden is an excellent writer with the potential of producing truly brilliant work. But this novel bored me to tears. Mr. Barden, please keep writing, but let's put John Wayne to rest for good."
2,Dull! Humorless! Trite! Poorly Written!,"Why oh why was this ""novel"" published? Was it because it happens to have the name of a famous American icon as the title and central figure? Shameless marketing strategy, if so, and a deplorable waste of time, paper and money. Barden might have a good book in him, but this definitely isn't it."
5,I am glad I read it.,"I wanted to read ""John Wayne"" before I read Dan Barden's newest book, ""The Next Right Thing"". I truly enjoyed reading JW - the imagery, the dialogue is really very good. I thought it was interesting how, as the book finished, JW figured into the story - the book is not about him, but he is a sort of sounding-board for the other characters in the story. It was a very fulfilling book."
1,IS NOT WORTH SPENDING MONEY ON,"After reading this book I was left completely unsatisfied. The subject matter, plot, and overall writing was horrible. I would not waste your time OR money on this book!"
1,Gave me a headache...,"Fiction or not, this author's writing gave me a terrible headache. His sentences were often rambling, incoherent statements which never made a point. Don't waste your time."
5,Heavy Reading from the Best in the Business,"This is considered hands down one of the (probably THE) BEST strength training books ever written. Siff compiles everything that is needed for top level athletes (primarily their coaches) to succeed in their strength sport of choice. Westside Barbell used this book for much of the groundwork for their incredible powerlifters' programming. Supertraining provides the basis for all of the most important strength training methods, and therefore leaves an open avenue to how to utilize the information in actual training programs. Its very heavy reading, but a vital part of anyone who engulfs themselves in strength knowledge's library. The sky is the limit with Supertraining, you can apply the principles in so many ways you may not have considered before, or maybe isn't even in use by anyone else either, as was the case with Westside, before everyone else copied their winning methods. Get it!"
3,Better here than when i seen them.,"Contrary to some moronic kids belief this is NOT a class on religion.But if you really want to get technical Satanism is based on Carnality and force of human nature hence it dates back to the days of the cavemen.Anyways about this cd,I seen COF on their midian tour and was very dissapointed the sound was shotty,the show was short,and they didnty play anything from the vempire EP.Now had i got this show i would have been quite alot more impressed.The sound is good,The Setlist is great and The Album does have a sence of being there even if you werent.The bonus disc does have some good stuff worth checking out as well,The soundchecks in particular."
3,Good with reservations.,"After much review I finally decided to purchase this fryer. It takes a little over a gallon of oil, which if not reused can become an added expense. The fried chicken wings I made were of restaurant quality. The downside is that the oil splattered a bit outside the fryer, and the frying smell lingered in the kitchen after cleanup. The oil was a pain to filter and strain for reuse although I suppose there are devices to help make this task a little easier. I have not tried it again on any other foods, and I would recommend a smaller unit for someone who only wants to fry a few french fries or a small batch of anything. I would only use this for making a family-sized dinner because the cleanup time is so extensive."
2,"Nice design, but broken","Seems pretty well designed and easy to use, but unfortunately it refused to power on one day after occasional (2 or 3 times a month) use six months into it's life. Manufacturer wouldn't fix it, so I'm going for a more reliable brand this time.It also overreported temperature of the oil by about 7 degrees C, which isn't a lot but enough to have to tweak recipes. Check ""350"" with a good thermometer to make sure."
5,Easy to use.,"The item came in a timely fashion and performed as indicated. We don't use one a lot but when we do, it is nice to have. We enjoy frying fish the most, but have fried potatoes and they are delicious as well."
4,"good results, long heat up",Products works great and better than my last deep fryer. But it does seem to take a little longer to reach temperature. And the beeps are very loud.
4,Works great! -Extra features worth the money.,"Have only used it once (chicken) but everything worked great right out of the box! Seems to be just the right size for 2-3 people. Cleanup was easy. The temp was right on with a candy/frying thermometer. The extra features ie, basket, timer, digital readout, etc. were worth the money."
5,Nice fryer,"Got this a few days ago from the mall. I like it. The instructions are clear and easy. It has a Min/Max level imprinted in it to tell you where the oil should be. But what I learnt with fryers is that they take a lot of oil. I brought the biggest Wesson oil bottle, and it still wasn't enough. This uses about 1 1/2 bottles of the biggest size, Wesson oil, comes in. The booklet tells you what foods (chicken, fish, fries, even cheese, for some reason) should cook at and how long. Even though it's digital, it's not confusing at all because it's really just 3 buttons you work with. Anyone can figure how to work this fryer. When the red light is on it means it's heating up. When it beeps and the green light comes on you can put the food in. There's an easy timer. The basket is neat too. It can hang on the fryer, as in the picture, so the food can cool down. I would highly recommend this fryer if you want to have some fried food sometimes."
3,Electrical system died after 4 months occasional use,"Powerful fryer, better than expected. Heated fast. Kept temp really well. But electrical system shot after just 4 months. I'd try another though."
4,Good,Works well. A little hard to clean. When vat is full of oil it's tricky to lift out of unit. Otherwise all good.
2,cooker,"its ok but really dont think it gets hot enough . Try to get the french fries crispy cant do it the just burn at 375 max temp other wise cooks shrimp chicken to perfection , over all not bad , and handle should be able to swing down after cooking to keep it out of the way while cooling down."
5,We use this fryer like crazy!,"It is the perfect size for everything we cook, we use it all the time. From cooking chicken wings & home made jalepano poppers for the football games, to deep frying to pork tenderloin madilions. Easy to use, clean up is a breeze, we could not have choosen a better product."
4,works great,"Nice sized fryer for a family. large basket,Easy clean up..just drain, rinse the tub and put it in the dishwasher. I like the higher sides that keeps the oil from over topping the fryer when cold things are added,Only thing that may be a bother to some is that it seems to take a long time to heat to the desired temp.it is a pretty good sized fryer and takes up a bit of counter space."
4,Kept in the Dark by Anthony Trollope,"This book had more of a mystery to it, and appealed to me in that respect. One had to wonder why she kept her secret for so long, when she had so many opportunities to reveal it. I still found it good reading, hoping that she would tell him at each meeting - and she didn't. But, it was an entertaining read, and a mischievous ending."
5,Kept in the Dark,I like amything written by Anthony Trollope. You don[t have to go through the sexual content that so many of the books have now. He was able to write a book with a plot and show the sexual parts of the book without vulgarity.
1,Best Kept in the Dark,"I am an avid fan of Trollope, but even so, I was unwilling to work through this difficult-to-read double-column format wrapped in a garish cover. I presume the original was in a 19th century magazine and this is merely photo-offset, but the product is clumsy and wearisome to the eye."
4,My favorite small edition...,"First off, the translation on this bible is, for the most part, solid. That, in itself, isn't really a compelling reason to buy it, there are plenty of other good translations out there, some perhaps even better than this one.However, this one has hands down better notes than any other cheap paperback bible. Every book of the bible has a brief, very scholarly written introduction, and clarifying footnotes on many pages.What I really respect is that the introductions and footnotes and really, legitimately, scholarly. The moralizing commentary routinely found in some ""study bibles"" is here reduced to simple notes of clarification on either odd historical points or lines that are hard to translate.More than enough to recommend this one, even to non-Catholics. Martin Luther might not have particularly liked the extra books, but he did say people should read them."
5,Perfect for those reading the Bible,I originally started reading the KJV of the Bible and found it difficult to understand the verbage. This Bible is great for the comprehension and the footnotes it provides.
5,I was digging for understanding and found gold...,"I have been exploring the Catholic religion recently. I ordered this Bible after finding out that there were additional books in the Catholic version of the Old Testament. I was curious. Now that I have read a lot of the additional books and a great many of the introductions to the other books of this Bible - I can honestly say that this is the most interesting, understandable, and enlightening Bible I have ever read."
3,Cajun,"Bibles were what I needed, but I failed to check out enough before purchase. It would have been a better aid for teaching if there were some type of page markings on edge of sheets, marking each book in the bible, which make it easier to show and direct to specific reading. Foot notes are help full. Quality is very good."
5,Great Bible. I might just purchase another,"Actually, I had this Bible sent to my recently converted sister! She liked the hard copy that I own! She said that it was the first Bible that she found easy to read."
4,The New American Bible,"I love the Bible except for the size of the font. I should have purchased it in a larger font because of my eye problems.Otherwise, it is terrific."
3,Print too small,"Content is great, but it should be a pleasure to pick up and read. Unfortunately, the print is so small that it discourages me from reading it.The study notes are an even smaller print."
1,Not what I ordered,I order the New American Bible and thought I was getting a new copy. Not only was what I received used but badly used and very personal to the previous owner. It was a gift to him and the giver had written a very personal note on the inside cover. Personal names were there and the front cover was torn. I was so surprised and disappointed.
3,I'm somewhat disappoionted.,"I was looking for the New American Bible, 1970, and what I received was a more recent edition."
5,The New American Bible for Catholics: With Revised New Testament and Revised Book of Psalms,[[ASIN:0529064847 The New American Bible for Catholics: With Revised New Testament and Revised Book of Psalms] are great and are being enjoyed by many.
3,error!,"There is a printing error in this 1990 edition of the NAB. Deut 10:12 should read, ""And now, Israel, what does the LORD, your God, ask of you but to fear the LORD, your God, and follow his ways...."" It is sad to see that the editors at World Bible Publishing did not catch this. I have checked other editions of the NAB for the correct printing."
1,Product Dimensions are all wrong.,The product dimensions here are off by a factor of ten. The dimensions of the product were VERY important in my decision to purchase this particular bible.
3,beat up,This book when arrived at my door was beat up. the cover is all wrinckled and bent it is what i need for my classes but wish it was in better condition.
4,The New American Bible,Just what my teenage duaghter needed for her Religion class. A little hard to find passages at first. Thank you.
1,Not what I wanted,"I searched for an enlarged print bible. When this one came up in the list, I trusted that it was indeed large print. It was not."
2,Far better translations are available,"Granted - this is the version forced into the lectionary of the Roman Catholic churches in the United States, but that is understandable considering the bishops held the copyright. I gave this a ""two"" rather than a ""one"" only because it is not so bad as a few popular bibles which are mere paraphrases.Though the content is not inaccurate, it seems the authors were so desperately trying to be ""super-American"" that they translated passages into American slang, ironically not realising how that can vary according to region and era. For example, in the parable of the Prodigal Son, generations would have understood the word ""harlot,"" where ""loose women"" does not have the same accuracy.For a contemporary, accurate version of the Bible, in non-slaughtered language, try the Revised English Bible."
3,not new,"Ordered this book as new. Arrived with checkmarks on pages in marker, crumbs between pages and grease on at least one page that I noticed. Returning this book."
2,A disappointment,"Pales in comparison to her previous book, the recipes are average. Best to avoid this book."
5,Wonderful Cookbook,"Giada De Laurentiis is one of my favorite chefs. Her second book is a hit. Her recipes are truly delicious because it targets a flavor and expands on it. Every single one of the recipes that I have tried in this book (I have yet to try them all) are all so flavorful and delicious. She herself is an inspiration. Her recipes have that special touch, that love of food, that shows through all her delicious offerings. She expands a bit from her first book, which had the traditional first offerings of ""simple"" dishes. I prefer this book to her first one, as there are plenty of ""simple"" sauces to go around. I prefer Giada's home touch, which this book has plenty of."
3,Good but not great,"There are some good recipes in this book, but too many photos of Giada and not enough of the food! I get inspired by seeing the finished product and if you are also visual this way, you will be disapointed by this book (unless you bought it to look at photos of Giada and her family). I think Giada is a good cook, but borders on the Nigella Lawson sucking on her fingers theme with all the photos going on of her clevage. The book is beautifully done and the food is good, but I think The River Cafe Italian Easy blows this out of the water. Or, go for Giada's first book which is better."
3,Ok but not great,This book was ok.... but watch Food network often... and to me it was not up to par with what I like about Gadia's cooking Show.
2,Basic Recipes - Nothing Unusual,I found this cookbook just okay. It had recipes in it that are pretty common Italian family fare - nothing unusual or fancy - Not really representative of Giada's normal style and flare. I bought this for a gift for someone with a family. I would not have bought this particular cookbook if I knew what was in it ahead of time. I would have picked a different Giada cookbook.
5,Cookbook Review,I am an avid cookbook collector and cook. This is one of the best cookbooks that I have ever purchased.Worth every penny its worth.
5,Excellent cookbook,I received this book for Christmas and have been enjoying recipes from it several times a week. Every single one so far has been a winner. The recipes are easy to put together and so delicious.
4,"Little gripes, overall yummy","Overall, I love Giada's simple recipes. My gripe is more with the production of the book. Many of the photos are either unlabeled or not near the recipe they depict (either label them all or none or put them all next to the recipe). There are LOTS of photos of Giada (and her dog and her family). While I think we can all agree that Giada is photogenic, I'd rather get an idea of what I'm going to be making and how appetizing it should look.But those are just picky gripes from someone who loves food photography and wants more.Sure some people take offense that her recipes are to simple or Americanized, but I think they are tasty. And that's that."
5,Giada's Family Dinners,"I bought this book for my wife and she loves it! Great recipes and the book is beautifully illustrated. After trying some of her recipes, the purchase was money well spent. Try it you'll love it:)"
1,Drive Failed in 8-months,"I purchased this drive in APR 2006 and it failed in DEC 2006, taking with it 250GB of iMovie Projects and both the Firewire 400 and Firewire 800 Ports on my Apple PowerBook G4. Now it's costing me extra money for data recovery, firewire repair, and a new external hard drive.Since the drive set on my desk at home and was only occasionally used for iMovie projects - I expected it to last much longer and be much more reliable.Very disappointed :-("
4,A delightful read,"A very entertaining book. I was expecting the book to be entirely about riddles, but I was quite surprised to see riddles, short stories, poems, and even a humorous dictionary of terms.Worth the money for sure."
2,What Hurts About Cell is He Was Broken IN Package...,I do not Reccommend This Figure At All...First of All When I first Opened the Blister to Take Cell Out I was Expecting something Great Because He had also Arrived With Vegeta...Vegeta Looks and Performs Rather Well Despite his Right arm Popping off Every Once in awhile...But Cell's Right Arm Was Already Damaged Before I even took it out! The Peg Holding his Arm had been Snapped in Half... The Other Half was still inside the Figure...I Made the Effort to E-mail and See if They'll At Least Send me a Replacement Because Like I said... He isn't Much Used to Me Broken Like this...I do hope They Will Send me the New One... Because this Really Hurts...Only The Second time I've Ever Bought anything from Amazon.com and It's been partly Ruined From a Defective Figurine Broken Before I even got it out of the Blister...How Sad is that?
2,Only good half the time....,"I love the fact that I can see how and what my child is doing, but this monitor only works half the time. It completely stopped working after 2 years so we bought another one (there aren't that many out there in the stores to choose from). The new one has a fixed antenna which will not move to help secure a better picture like the first one. The picture is clear during the morning/day and in the evening/night, the picture gets quite static. The sound is not bad, but the louder you have it, the more static you hear. I like the size of the screen.....if I could actually see my child when I wanted too."
2,"With the constant static noise, this is going back...","I have researched so many monitors, I could write a thesis. We've had a Lorex for sometime now in our baby's room and screen in ours UNTIL it started clicking/popping at night. So, I decided to buy 2 different kinds of monitors at once and compare and take the 'lesser operating' one back. Well, the other brand is charging as I type, so I hooked this Summer one up -no charging needed.... GREAT picture ...in the dark (w/ nightlight in room)- kudos in that dept. BUT, it's the white static noise that we CANNOT deal with. If it were SOFT white noise, fine. But, nope, harsh static...no sleep static... sleep isn't happening static, sooo back to the store this puppy goes.HOWEVER, if you only want to use this during the day and/or that sound doesn't bother you, then -GREAT picture, clarity & nice big screen."
2,Too much static,"The idea of this product is great. We get so much static that it's almost impossible for us to even use this, I've been startled numerous times in the middle of the night. It's so loud at night that we have to turn the volume down almost all the way, which totally defeats the purpose. When there's a lot of static the picture is so distorted you can't see anything. You can't leave the screen on at night because it lights up the entire room. The picture isn't very clear, so it's hard to watch for detailed movement - like breathing. I would not recommend this product."
1,Step Away from the Monitor,"Bottom line: You don't want this thing.Here's why...first, if you have any kind of radio interference where you live, you can forget about ever using the audio part of this. We had to buy a separate audio monitor and turn the volume all the way down on this one (sort of defeats the purpose of the all in one monitor).Second, you rarely can get a clear picture. I don't mean a little static or the black and white is not crisp, I mean any picture besides a blizzard-like snow pattern. However, on the plus side, if you stand a certain distance and certain angle from the monitor part, you'll get a clear picture. Walk away and it's gone. Now, the angle and distance aren't predictable, so you'll have to experiment each night. You can actually keep your hand on the back of the unit and that also generates a clear picture. Again, don't remove your hand. This is a little awkward at first, when you try to sleep standing up with one arm raised, but you get used to it."
3,our works fine,"Ours seems to work ok. It doesn't get great reception on our living room but it's workable. I can see what she's doing from the couch while I watch my shows. The static noice doesn't seem that load to me. the volumn does not seem bad to me unless you turm up the volumn really load. I even run a fan in the babies room and still not much static. I would recommend buying this from Walmart or Babies r us and saving your reciept in case it doesn't work for you. It's hard to return things you've bpught online and TARGET is really strict about thier return policy. Do not buy any baby gear there. I'm serious. Walmart, Kmart and Babies r Us will take things back, no questions asked if you have a reciept and will ussuallt replace or give store credit without a reciept."
4,so far good,"We haven't used it a lot in the last two months (she is two months now), but so far goo signal transmission."
1,"Get something else, even if it costs more.","We bought one of these in spring of 2006 when our son was about 5 mos old, and it worked great with no problems. About 18 mos later, however, the cord started to fail such that the monitor wouldn't come on unless we moved the cord around to some random ""magic spot."" (Move around as in, turn the part that goes into the back of the monitor.) One day last week, the cord finally just died, and we couldn't get the monitor to come back on at all. The next day, we bought a new one of the very same monitor, and it's AWFUL. The picture is fine, but we were up til 2:30 am the first night, trying to find a place where the monitor didn't make this horrible, repetitive, endless static noise. I finally ended up sleeping alone in our guest room because I couldn't take it anymore. We're returning it today, and I don't care if we have to spend $300 on something else, as long as it doesn't make that noise."
4,FANTASY PHONE FOR POWER RANGERS FANS,"THIS LITTLE ITEM IS INEXPENSIVE AND YET MAKES A BIG HIT WITH THE KIDS. THEY FEEL REALLY INTO THE POWER RANGERS SCENE WITH THIS PHONE. MY BOYS WERE THE FIRST TO GET ONE AND EVERYONE WANTED ONE AFTER THEM. THE DELIVERY WAS FAST, ORDERING WAS EASY - AND THANKS TO AMAZON, I MAY NEVER GO TO ANOTHER WEBSITE TO ORDER TOYS AGAIN. AMAZON IS THE BEST!"
4,Financial Institutions Management: a Risk Management Approac,"It was good book, and the seller also good, but the problem they couldn't send any book out of the state. Overall is good."
3,Okay,"Great deal, but the edition it was listed under was the worng one. I thought I was getting the right edition, but it was an older one. It still works though."
5,love it!,It came very quickly and I love it. It was packaged carefully and shipped quickly and exactly like the description.
4,Greek cooking,This book gave a touch of Greek history with easy-to-follow recipes. I highly recommend it.
4,Good authentic Greek recipes.,I bought the first book 10 years ago and use it regularly. After some time it started falling apart so I found a good deal in Amazon and purchase another used copy in very good shape. I will pass it to my children
3,What the ?,"Could someone please explain to me what happened here? I sat through this entire movie and then it abruptly ends.Storyline and dialog are not the strong suits of this movie. It holds you, for whatever reason, but it's a blend of desert wanderers meets Deliverance.I can't recommend that you do or don't watch it. Some degree of intoxication may be warranted, however, as the movie is downright bizarre. Lots of sex, if you're into that. Nice desert scenes, as well.In terms of a plot ... well, you let me know."
1,very disturbing,I thought this was going to be a mild lackluster movie until it got close to the end. There are two scenes that are very disturbing & not for the weak of heart. Movies do not usually stay with me but this one was so distubing it is still on my mind. I wish I had not bought this one. It made me stress.
3,abou the cannes film festival movie twentynine palms......,The story is basically to see how the man vould understand the woman's desire to certain extent but the story turns into a murder (with knife) towards the woman whom is tagging the man all along. This is a french likke film which is recorded in English and it contains four sexual content altogether with a kill. A recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film. Enjoy.....
1,Palmy,"Possible THE worst move I've seen in a long time. A couple fight and have sex in the desert around Joshua Tree where I once lived. He speaks English and she speaks French, which is weird in itself. Then the ""plot"" is non-existent. The ending is extremely violent, so beware if you get that far. This seems like a glorified porno film, only worse than an actual one because of the pretensions herein. Don't waste your time."
1,Totally Pointless waste of time,"What a total and utter turd this movie is. I feellike punching the maker in his face and demandinghe find a time machine to replace the 2 hours I wasted.And whats with the gratuitious orgasms ? Man we werehowling with laughter ! Dude, youve made the worstfilm Ive ever, ever seen. Ive watched films before I admitI didnt ""get"", but none ever actually prompted angertill now."
1,Nonsene in the Worst French Way,"David, one of the most annoying actors you'll ever encounter, and Katia, a red-haired Frenchwoman who has had a lobotomy (I think) travel the California desert in their red Hummer, scouting for ""locations"" and then have loud, not very appealing sex in their motel room. Then three madmen appear out of nowhere and sodomize David. Their appearance is like the viewer's wish granted: characters so willfully uncompelling should be chastised, although the real punishment should be dished out to the director. He apparently watched a few Michaelangelo Antonioni films in his youth and thinks he can do it too. He can't."
5,Can I give it 25 stars?,I didn't know what to expect when I got this book in the mail. I have been very pleasantly surprised. The stories are very unlike the Vonnegut we're used to. It's similar to Thurber in many repsects. Love it!!
5,"Daughter pleaser, father face-saver","The only KV I've read is ""Cat's Cradle"" and that was 30 years ago. I noticed that my divine and discerning elder daughter carrying round various Vonnegut volumes so, ..., I snapped it up."
3,Early Vonnegut shows promise,Not what I was expecting having read all of his previous work. You could tell this was Vonnegut but with out the flair and maturity of Welcome to the Monkey House or Breakfast of Champions. Some were a joy to read.
4,vonnegut in short form,"The contents are short stories from mainly the fifties that Vonnegut got published in various magazines of the day. The stories read like typical Vonnegut, though in short format, you can tell Vonnegut focuses more on characters than on plot. I found it enjoyable. My one critique is that many of the stories were very very similar. As if he published one in Cosmo, and they called him and said ""we like that! give us more as close to that as possible!"""
4,"Even in three generations, things don't change that much.","I enjoyed this collection of Vonnegut's earlier short stories for many reasons: I liked that the same character (high school band instructor George Hemholtz) is the protagonist in three of the stories; several stories had surprise endings; Vonnegut used no profanity whatsoever--and didn't need to in order to be effective and entertaining; and reading Vonnegut's early fiction helps me get a clearer understanding of what life in America was like for my parents' and grandparents' generations. Finally, this group of tales demonstrates the author's keen insight into the lives and minds of women. Although Kurt Vonnegut was born several years after my own grandparents, I myself can identify with several of the female characters in the stories in this collection. I, too, worry that I am becoming a bored--and boring--housewife, ""wasting"" my potential."
3,Coming to a Close,"In the introduction to this collection, Vonnegut says, ""there is no greatness in this or my other collection, nor was there meant to be."" His admirable humility speaks more truth than perhaps ardent fans would like to admit--these stories, besides being dated (a forgivable offense, surely) present nothing his other, greater work has not already delivered. Timequake served as a fantastic close to a fabulous career, these stories function more as an appendix than a finale."
2,Disappointing,"If you're a fan of Welcome to the Monkey House, you'll be very disappointed in this collection of Vonnegut's short stories. It contains none of the warmth, humor, or poignant moments you would expect from a writer of his skill. It's as if you were reading the rejects from his wastepaper basket."
3,"Warm, Satisfying... but don't expect too much.","The author has always been an intriguing and offbeat writer but to be honest for most of my life I haven't much cared for his writings. That is, until I put down Mr. Vonnegut's novels and tried his short stories. Very few writers can do short stories well, and Vonnegut is superb. This collection is not of his best, but of many older stories that many have not read. Most are excellent, a few are magnificent and only one was a quick death--thank God.Good collection for Vonnegut lovers, but perhaps not worth the hardpack price for others."
3,Bagombo Snuff Box not quite up to snuff,"Bagombo Snuff Box continues the slow descent Vonnegut began with the publication of Timequake, which was often charming but lacked the guile and precision of earlier works such as Cat's Cradle and Deadeye Dick. The same is true for Bagombo Snuff Box as compared to collections like Palm Sunday. If Bagombo Snuff Box were a punctuation mark at the end of Vonnegut's career it would be ... rather than ! Far better than Timequake which was a definite ? Vonnegut's legacy, however, continues to inform such books as The Late Projectionist by Daedalus Howell (it may as well be a love letter to his mentor) and movies like Moebius by Gustavo Mosquera. Vonnegut will be with us a long time."
4,Enjoyable and Timely Read,"Contemporary adventure with some timely historical perspective for us ""not so well informed"" on African colonial history and once again the folly of empire building and the consequences of inevitable failure."
1,"Insufferable braggart writes self-serving, witless tome.","This book should be retitled ""Portrait of a pompous boor."" Here's a typical quote: ""Father now thinks of us as landed gentry...He was wearing a Sea Island cotton shirt with a discreet 'B' monogrammed on the pocket, beige pants, his silver Iron Horse belt, and boots. I said, 'Daddy, you look like a Ralph Lauren ad.' I meant it as a compliment, but he was miffed. 'Ralph Lauren is just an imitation of people like us,' he said."" I couldn't get past page 40. I would rather slit my throat than crawl through the rest of this book."
1,Ditto Los Angeles,"Couldn't agree with Los Angeles more. I rarely give up on a book, but Joy Sterling is so annoyingly self-absorbed (she writes that on her wedding day no one could go out for a decent meal because most of America's great chefs were at her party) that I became too disgusted to continue. Too bad, because the story of growing and bottling wine is an interesting one, and she doesn't tell it poorly. Anyone who finds space in a book about wine to describe her own birthday as being ""on the order of an intergalactic holiday,"" however, is drastically overestimating her audience's interest in the pretentious details of her life."
2,Not dense enough,This item is really flimsy and compressed far to easily. It might be ok if you don't have to put any pressure on it. I was trying to find a cover for my walker handles.
4,Ship Of Fools - 'Let's Get This Mother Outta Here' (Snapper),"'Let's Get...' is basically nine tracks from the Yorkshire band's two lp's they released in the early '90's,'Close Your Eyes' and 'Out There Somewhere'.Ship Of Fools are best described as smoothly played progressive psych,or some may just tag them as trippy festival-like space rock.Tunes I liked best were ""L=SD 2"",""First Light"",the fourteen-minute atmospheric ""From Time"" and ""Passage By Night"".The line-up for this short-lived UK ensemble was:Les Smith-keyboards(now in Cradle Of Filth),Andy Banks-guitar,Sputnik-bass and Mick Reed-drums.Great to listen to late at night.Should appeal to most fans of earlier Pink Folyd,Ozric Tentacles and Porcupine Tree."
3,Re-recordings but ok,"Well, when I got the cd I was a lot dissapointed when I opened the case and read ""ALL songs recorded march april may 1997"". Why can't Ladies and Gentlemen of record labels re-release the original records on CDs? The inserts say that ""were unable to work it out"" Anyway, despite re-recordings the songs sound ok."
5,Vengo,"A truly exceptional film, raw and moving. Itself a great piece of flamenco with full of duende.It is a simple story of loyalty, love, agony and fate of a Rom (i.e., Gypsy) family caught in a feud of revenge with another family. Musically it is a remarkably rich anthology of living flamenco and its North African heritage. Don't expect a theatrical, stylized presentation of flamenco dances like the ones in Carlos Saura's films. The dances you'll see are spontaneous and real, and for that reason, more touching and memorable.The final two pieces of music are a masterstroke of the director/composer Gatlif. The instrumental piece, consisting of the sounds of sheet metal hammering and whipping, an engine starter, and a rickety pump engine, is a pure essence of flamenco. The beautifully sung, melancholic ""Naci en Alamo"" will then lead you through the dark passage of death.I only wish that a video or DVD would be released soon so that I could see it over and over again."
4,Vengo,"First rate for its depiction of contemporary Andalusian gypsy life and its vivid dance and music. However, the story line is very weak. The film hangs loosely around a vendetta between two families, and of course ends in the expected way. I loved the opening music, the mixture of Moroccan Arabic and gypsy, but I have absolutely no idea what it had to do with the film's plot, if anything. Re Caco's daughter, Pepa, her death obviously plays a large part in what happens, but the circumstances surrounding her death are vague in the extreme. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this movie just for the music and dancing. The acting also is first-rate, honest and compelling in the depiction of the human emotions expressed in the story. It is terrific at this level, and it's extremely refreshing to find a film daring to deviate from the standard junk fare that the American film industry thrusts down our throats."
1,Save Your Money. Don't Buy This Film,"I like flamenco by itself and prefer it not to be woven around some kind of ""story."" I know this is a really politically incorrect thing to say, but I don't like films that feature people who are severly disfigured to the point where their body, motor skills, and speech are greatly impaired. To make matters worse, there's a scene where this disabled person is introduced to a beautiful prostitute for the purpose of having an ""assignation."" While they didn't actually show anything, I find this sort of thing to be utterly distasteful and I don't see how it adds to any film. In fact, I couldn't even finish watching this film, let alone my dinner because I lost my appetite.I purchased the film, ""Latcho Drom,"" another film by Tony Gatlif, which I loved, but I definitely wouldn't recommend ""Vengo"" to anyone. If you want to see flamenco, there others to choose from. Anyway, I'm sorry I purchased this."
4,Refreshingly Good!!!!,"First time hearing this young woman.The production is solid and the lyrics are positive. I'll probably purchase her previous work,just to get a better gauge on her sound. That aside, this is a strong set from Ms. Ross"
3,Nice - but now I see why I had never heard of Kendra Ross.,"I see now why I had never heard of Kendra Ross. The musical arrangements on many of the tracks were very beautiful but her voice is nothing special. The tone of her voice is nice but I kept visualizing her standing somewhere perfectly still trying very hard to sing the songs and not mess up. She clearly lacks the freedom and flexibility that comes with having a vocal range and talent. I kept waiting for her to break out and break it down; of course, she could not. That being said, it seemed very tiresome for to try to scat or improvise as she did on a few tracks. The whole CD just got boring. I guess I had to find out if Kendra's voice was really a ""new voice"" worth hearing. It was not. And there is really no comparison to Diana Ross in my opinion. Diana's voice may be light, but she really can sing."
5,A good surprise,"For those ones who always loved Tears For Fears and became a little disapointed with the first Smith's Album (Soul on Board), Aeroplane is really a good surprise. It seems he found his ownn stile, more acoustic, creating great songs as Reach Out. And, furher to a total acoustic version for Evereybody Wants to Rule, there's an amazing hard version for Pale Shelter, which is really fantastic, much better than the original one. This CD makes me very excited and curious about what will be the result of a TFF return. (Smith and Roland Orzabal have been working together for months for a new TFF project)"
3,Not Quite Taking Off,"The other half of Tears for Fears (as if you remember), Curt Smith follows up his first band record, the uneven Mayfield, with Aeroplane, an E.P. that consists of two new songs written with Mayfield's guitarist, two remixes of Mayfield songs, and versions of two classic Tears for Fears songs. The two new songs are okay, the remixes better the CD versions (especially the cheesy lounge version of ""Snow Hill""), and the TFF songs are one for two. The rocked up remake of ""Pale Shelter"" is an embarrassment, which he makes up for with a lilting acoustic ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World""."
2,For completists only,"""Aeroplane"" is the third release in Curt Smith's ""solo"" career, and the third disappointment. The CD contains two new songs, ""Aeroplane"" and ""Where Do I Go,"" which are decent, but lyrically awkward. There are also remixes of two tracks from Curt's ""Mayfield"" album. Both of these tracks were better in their original versions. The only real reason to buy the CD is for the acoustic version of ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World,"" which is absolutely lovely."
2,A musical kamikaze,"It really pains me to say this but this album is not very good. With four songs on here with boring cover versions of two dynamite TFF classics Aeroplane could just come crashing down to the ground. I guess his departure from TFF really was a huge blow to his musical ability. Three of the non cover tracks are mediocre and easily forgettable. Reach Out is a good song and is the highlight of this album but you can get that on his band Mayfield's debut album. Get Roland's Tomcats Screaming Outside'. With the musical battle between Aeroplane and Tomcats Screaming Outside, Tomcats easily surpasses this one on all fronts. I,m not trying put down Curt but his band Mayfields debut is far better than Aeroplane. I definately look forward to the TFF reunion album. It will be a blast."
1,"Curt takes another nosedive in ""aeroplane""","First was the adult contemporary sleeper (as in falling asleep) ""Soul on Board"". Next came the abrasive rock of ""Mayfield"" which was equally forgettable. Now we have try number 3. No improvement. Banal lyrics, pointless remakes of TFF classics, and uninvolving musical accompaniment adds up to another flop for Curt. At least we TFF fans have Roland Orzabal's first official solo release, ""Tomcats Screaming Outside"" to look forward to."
4,Shortage of Good Train Song CDs,"Why is it so hard to find a good collection of train songs? This album was an exciting find for the father of a four-year-old train nut. I've always been partial to Merle Haggard, so the opportunity for my son to get a fix of train songs and be indoctrinated into my world of good, old country music was one I could not pass up. I would give it five stars but for the fact that a few of the songs are more about the destination than the mode of transportation. Frankly my son is too young to care about the benefits of living in the south...he just wants to hear a train whistle and what the engineer said to the brakeman.So five stars just because it is Merle, three stars for the selection of songs equals four stars.PS - the best ""song"" on the entire album is Merle's a cappella opening lines of ""Mama tried"". Man, what a voice!"
5,Merlw haggard At His Best,"Woh, As An Old Railraodman, I Realy Like This Album From The Very First Song--To The End. Great Job Merle"
1,Be careful of fakes!,"First off, I just noticed that the description on this item is for 2 different headset. The one with the ear holder is not the one you are getting. You should be getting the one below with no ear holder. I don't know anything about the one with the holder, but the one without is the WEP200, and unfortunately the one I received here fulfilled by Amazon turned out to be a fake. I've read through many descriptions of fake ones in the internet, and the one they shipped me (1)came with an ear holder. The real Samsung ones do NOT come with an ear holder, (2) has a charger with no label at all (if you check out the one the guy shows on the video review, his says Samsung on the top of the charging box), (3)did not come with a user manual. I never thought that anything I would get fulfilled by Amazon and shipped via Amazon Prime would be a fake. Very disappointed."
2,blue tooth,The blue tooth itself worked well but the ear piece is to thin and it breaks easily.I would not buy this as you'll just be sending it back due to the ear piece breaking.
3,Good sound; poor fit,"I've had the Samsumg WEP200 for over six months now and I have mixed feelings about it. The sound quality, bluetooth range and controls are all great. Unfortunetly the unit doesn't stay in my ear. Since it didn't come with instructions on how to wear it, I simply cram it into my ear and hope it stays put. The second I move (walking, turn my head, etc.) it falls out."
4,good quality unit but has minor echo,"I got this as a gift for a special lady and from my experience of her talking to it with the bluetooth headset i noticed she sounds a bit far and echoey, but much better than my motorola bluetooth units (HS720, HS850, etc). One good thing is the generic/ cheap 5$ samsung car charger for the A670 works on this headset.Its a good unit for those who want something fashionable but as other reviews have mentioned one must be careful when taking it out of the ""coffin"" charger."
3,wrong item for me,I have a few friends that have this headset. They love it. I on the other hand have ears that do not fit this headset.
5,Execellent Bluetooth,"I love to use Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Headset, it is very clear and very small to use plus the battery last for a long time too."
4,Great but you need to get the ear hook.,Loved it except I needed to buy the ear hok with it. it doesn't stay in the ear otherwise.
4,Amazing for the price.,"I use the Sprint Mogul and as many users of this phone know there are inherent problems with the bluetooth on this phone. Most people have the best luck with the Jawbone headsets and a few various Plantronics headsets that cost over $100, but I'm cheap and decided to try this model. It's great.I had absolutely not problems whatsoever pairing the headset and keeping it paired. The call quality is really good as well. I've specifically asked people who I talk to using the headset what it sounds like on their end and they tell me they can't tell I'm on a headset at all. The volume is good. Sometimes I even have to turn it down a notch or two.This product would get five stars except that sometimes I get a little static when the battery gets low, but that's not very often. Standby and talk times are very good.Unless you just HAVE to have a super-fancy headset, do yourself a favor and give this one a shot. I honestly can't imagine bluetooth getting much better than this."
1,This is not a good product,"1st week after I purchased, the thin plastic holder broke. 2 months later the WEP200 totally malfunction. Other party cannot hear me well. There is no connection with the cellular phone. Except you can hear the on and off tone. I don't suggest anyone to buy WEP200. It is cheap and poor quality item."
1,Bluetooth with a cavity,"Don't waste your time on this item, it will not stay in your ear even during the slightest movement. The device picks up alot of background noise and you can not hear the calling party unless you push this too small device in your ear. Worst wireless headset I have ever had. Buy a Jawbone."
3,"Nice size, but not great for car","I like the size of the Samsung, but it feels just a little too loose in my ear and not very stable... like turning my head quickly will cause it to fly out. Also, the sound volume isn't terrific in the car... I drive a new Honda Civic and sometimes the Samsung can't compete with the road noise."
2,Uncomfortable,"What a pain ... I have small ear canals and the earpiece was extremely uncomfortable due to its size. With a poor fit, the headset kept falling out of my ear. Returned for full credit."
2,Painful in Ear,Does not fit comfortably in my ear and causes pain after wearing for too long. The sound is good and it connects quickly with my phone.
3,More limited than expected,"Works ok, but doesn't fit real well in the ear with any of the provided size earpiece covers. But I guess that's the sacrifice of one without the over-the-ear piece. Also the sound quality is not great. This is my first headset, so maybe they all have relatively low quality sound, but when driving(and that's what I bought it for), those on the other end often complain or ask me to repeat myself. It's no way to do business. And ends up creating more distractions and dangerous hassles during driving than holding the handset. Convenient in the quiet office though."
1,Design flaws easily broken,I've had this item for less then 1 month and the ear hoop/hook what ever has broken on me. To charge the unit you have to remove this hook so the ear piece fits in it's charger box. Yeah well 3rd time every charging it and the hook snaped right where it would hook onto the earpiece. Seriously this thing is flawed and should just be avoided period. Not to mention the autio qaulity is skiddish even with the phone litterly being right in front of me.I wish I never wasted my money on this
3,"Decent sound quality, poor wearability","Good for the price. Very good sound quality and me or the person on the other line has no trouble in listening to each other. Biggest issue is the ear bud style hook. If not put right the headset can fall off just because of gravity. If put right so that it does not fall, then my ear starts hurting after about more than half an hour of talking. But I still use it because of the good sound quality and the price of the headset with rebates on Amazon was $[...]!"
3,A little bit scratchy,"I bought this as a present for my wife. It seems to work well with the exception of a little bit of a ""scratchy"" sound when used."
2,blootooth,this is the 2nd tsamsung bluetooth that i have purchased and I am very UNHAPPY WITH BOTH OF THEM!! The loop that goes over the ear breaks very quickly and when I called Samsung they said that they no longer make that part and will not do anything for me.In other words what that means is that I wasted my money and have no use for the items.NEVER BUY SAMSUNG!!
3,Ok for the money,"This is my first bluetooth device. I like that its small. People seem to hear me just fine and I can hear them. Only complaint is it doesnt seem to have any range (of course it may be my phone) but if its in my pocket it cuts in and out, but works just fine if I am in my car...."
2,A month later: an aggravating little waste of time,"First, the ear clip snapped around the clip that holds it on. Hmm, OK, I'll replace it.EVERY time that I tried to answer a call with that wondrous ""one button wonder"" I disconnected or worse, couldn't hear it loud enough. for whatever Allen Funt reason, this !#!@?!! thing resets to the lowest audio setting all by itself. It doesn't fit into my ear(s) but sort of hangs over it on that damned cheap earpiece that never held right. Pretty much guaranteed to be a worse distraction while driving than picking up the phone itself: distractingly nonfunctional and some engineer's idea of punking everybody who buys it.This was a replacement for my lost Samsung headset that was a much better product, but gone, darn it. As such, I've relegated THIS absurd farce to a place on a shelf until I can conveniently find a way to extract some measure of revenge on it."
3,Doesn't work well (or at all) with the iPhone,"Bought this as a Black Friday deal from Amazon. Great price.The headset does not fit very well in my ear and sometimes it will just sort of fall out.Additionally, this unit does not work very well or at all with the iPhone. It was difficult to associate with the iPhone initially but was accomplished with some time, patience, and support forums at apple.com. Also when I turn on the bluetooth on the iPhone it doesn't always sync up. Process has become to turn on bluetooth, turn on the WEP200, hope it works. Even when the iPhone says it is associated, calls will not work through the headset. It will list the active audio source at the WEP200, but no sound is coming through. It is very intermittent. Place a call and it works correctly. Finish the call. Place another call and it does not work at all...I think I'll try to find another headset that works with the iPhone."
3,Samsung WEP200 - A bit too small,"The Samsung WEP200 paired flawlessly with my Samsung cell phone. It works fine and the reception is clear. However, it is very small and it isn't easy to use the function buttons because of its small size. It will not stay in my ear without the detachable ear loop. It is an annoyance to have to remove the detachable ear loop to recharge it. Function-wise, it works fine but I would not recommend it because of the very small size and the recharging issue."
3,"good bluetooth, but hook deficient","Bluetooth. it should come with a bunch of extra ear hooks, because they break with use. the hook must be removed in order to charge the unit, a defect. Removing and replacing the hook causes breakage. New hooks are exhorbitant. Like giving away a printer free, in order to sell ink, or a razor in order to sell blades. Otherwise the unit is good and worth the price."
3,sounds good,although these have good sound and work well they broke within two days and very easily from just trying to put it over the ear. I think they should be made a little more sturdy.
1,Horrendous lag. Annoying latency. Doesn't fit.,"If you are thinking of using this for computer gaming forget it. I tried it with World of Warcraft on an Inspiron E1705 running Windows XP Media Center Edition. Lag in Wintergrasp was horrendous. When I turned off sound effects, lag completely disappeared.There is also a 2-second latency in game and in Ventrilo.Better drivers might help, but the box does not inlude a driver CD, and I cannot find drivers online.The earpiece is too large for my ear, even without any of the included rubber adapters. The ear loop barely holds the headset on."
1,Bad outweighs the good,"Not recommended for several reasons:1. Ear bud doesnt fit securely...falls out with the slightest of movement.2. The ear hook (1) that it comes with is amazingly flimsy and broke almost immediatley. As per the previous reviewer, Samsung will not replace it. The $2.52 ear hook must be purchased.3. It can only be charged using the case it comes with...just another unnecessary piece to deal with4. It can't be charged in the car; a real disadvantage since it has a max of 4 hours of talk time...not much for a travelling salesperson.On the up side: The audio is adequate...IF it stays in your ear to hear."
1,The WORST!,"This is a piece of junk...It won't fit in your ear...unless your ears are really big...the piece that goes in your ear is huge and those rubber things that you are supposed to be able to adjust for comfort...BULL!! Don't buy this...believe me, unless you have a big opening for your ear, this is painful...!"
4,Great Product,"I really like this ear bud. Good construction, great fit. My only complaint is that it can be a little loud at times for both parties. I usually turn the volume to the lowest setting. When anyone else is talking in the car, the receiving party says that it is very loud on their end."
1,"Low volume, poor quality and won't stay in the ear","My expectations from the reviews here were high. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. When I can get the WEP200 to stay in my ear the volume and quality of the voice is poor. There's more of a constant low volume hum (not really static) with this headset than any other I've used.After a few unsuccessful attempts at getting this resolved with support, I packaged it back up and sent it back to AccessoryOne. From the state of the package and contents that is precisely what had already happened with this headset before. It was clear that the package had been opened as it was not sealed, power supply was loose in the package with no twist tie on the cord and the small included manual was a bit mangled.I was disappointed with the device and even more disappointed that Amazon / AccessoryOne sold me an obviously used and poorly re-packaged headset."
5,MOM LOVES IT,"I bought this for my mother. She loves it! It's small, she can hear good, and it was not too difficult for my father to set it up for her."
2,Having problem pairing it with Sanyo M1(Sprint),I am having problem pairing this device with Sanyo M1. Does anyone have any idea on this regard? Simply the phone doesnt find it while searching for nearby bluetooth devices...
3,painful,"i like everything about this item, but problem is comfort. It hurts when wearing or placing it in our ear."
2,works OK but not great like other users says,"it works with LG VX8600, but not with Motorola V3M from Verizon. At first my LG vx8600 is having hard time finding this device, but once it creates the profile, connect is pretty easy. If the volumn is loud, it has too much feedback for the other end. so the volumn has to be small, kinda bad for driving with a lot of road noise. charger and box quality feel quite cheap. THis is my first Bluetooth headset, so I don't know how it perform compare to others. it is a mediocore performer in my opinion.I also have static noise problemIf my cell phone signal is like 1 bar or 2 bar, the other end is having hard time understanding me."
1,DONT BUY IT,"I bought this one as a present for my friend's fiance, it looked nice & small & affordable.It broke after less than 1 month, so what I did is I took it back to the shop I bought it from & I was informed that it was NOT under warranty, so I had to buy another one for my friend's fiance (without saying I paid for a 2nd one), what do you know, in less than another month the crappy piece broke again.Bottom line is, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, I have ALWAYS considered Samsung to be the worst maker of everything they make, and everytime I or anyone I know gets anything Samsung, it ends up in trash, I was tempted with the small size & affordable price, but... You get what you pay for.So if you want to have a good deal, go for Nokia or Jabra.Have a nice day all.CerberuS"
1,SAMSUNG WEP200 Bluetooth Headset - useless,"1st day - It started out with OK connection but then keep shutting off power and/or disconnect from the phone bluetooth.No clear indication when the unit is ""charging"".It is useless and had to return it - will not buy it again or suggest to someone else."
3,Not Compatible,"I bought the Samsung WEP200 bluetooth headset kit based on reviews here and elsewhere, but when it arrived I found it was not compabible with my other Bluetooth devices, including my Windows laptop and my Sprint smartphone (PPC-6700). The Samsung support person said they don't support any devices other than the Samsung cell phones. That's disappointing, because otherwise it's a nice unit."
1,did'nt work,I tried this ear piece with my Razor and my Slider...neither could connect to the phone......I should have realized by the price what was going to happen.
4,good buy!,small compact and easy to use. pairs up easily with samsung d807. has a good range too. but inside buildings when moving from one room to another sometimes the voice becomes robotic. voice quality is very good. battery life is also very good. i had it on-call for almost 6+ hours continously and the voice quality.
3,"Pretty, good, but it falls out!","The WEP200 sounds pretty good, is easy to use and is pleasantly small, but the system for keeping it in the ear is nearly useless. It comes with three different sizes of these little rubber loop things that are supposed to create enough pressure and friction on the inside of the auricle to keep the device in place, but none of them would keep the little thing in my ear, it would always fall out.It comes with nice a little case that also serves as the charger. However, this device also a little bit overpriced. So, on to the next one."
3,pretty good,I like this blue tooth a ton except I can't turn the volume low enough. Everyone sounds like they are yelling in my ear. Other than that it is great.
1,"Great Device, Lousy Earhook!","Cheap plastic ear hook must be disconnected each time you charge, so as I'm snapping it back on (after 4 uses), the clip snaps off. And only one 30 cent clip with the unit. Now it's gathering dust. Easy come easy go..."
2,Cheap but Servicable,"I previously owned a Samsung WEP. The battery failed in 13 months even though I used the device infrequently. After reading the reviews, I decided to try again. The WEP 200 is built cheaply and will not stay in my ear. No more Samsung WEPs for me."
2,Buyer Beware....,"The price was definitely right, and the charging ""cradle"" was kind of nice. However, there were a few problems I had with the device:1. earbud was too large to fit my ear, and caused moderate discomfort if worn for more than a few minutes2. part that clips on device to ""hook"" over the ear was used once - when I removed the ear hook (to try the device in my other ear, it broke. Of course, there are no replacement ear hooks available for purchase....3. in order to charge in the cradle, ear hook must be removed, wasting a bit of time to disassemble/reassemble - and increasing chances of breakage.So if you're okay with having the ear hook break and just fitting the device in your ear, it would be fine. However, I think Samsung dropped the ball with the design of the charger - obviously a cheap plastic hook is not going to withstand a lot of use, and a charger that didn't require the ear hook to be removed would have been great."
4,Great lightweight bluetooth headset,"I really like this inexpensive lightweight bluetooth headset! Works well on my end, but sometimes the person on the other end of the call hears an echo. Stays in my ear great without the clip that goes around your ear. It charges up in a protective flip top box, so the headset doesn't have to plug directly into wall charger. I store my headset in the small charging box and carry it in the small box in my pocket when not in use. I love it that this was only $18!!! Can't beat that price!!"
1,Keeps loosing pairing,I can use it a few times then it won't work. Have to shut it off and turn it back on. Maybe I should have spent more because at this rate--it's junk.
1,Good for a week,"I purchased this Bluetooth along with the phone. The earpiece would not stay on my ear (my ear is too small) and when I removed the earpiece from the bluetooth to put it in the charger the earpiece that attached to the Bluetooth broke. I have not been able to find another piece to replace the broken one (not even from T-Mobile, who I will never deal with again either), so it's totally useless now."
4,Great Product for the Price,"I've had my WEP200 for nearly 2 years now. My only issue with it has been the size. Like others, I've lost it several times. Beyond that, this is an amazing piece of electronics. Mine has been washed and dried (when I forgot to take it out of my pocket) at least 15 times now, and still works as well as the day I bought it. Clarity and volume are great. The person on the other end can hear me fine as well. Can't comment on the ear clip, as Samsung did not sell it with one when I bought mine. Definitely worth a look."
2,Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Wireless Headset,"It is small and light weight, both qualities I like. The sound is pretty good, but the piece that goes around your ear and attaches to the headset broke within 3 weeks and they only provided one. I noticed that when I am wearing it that I loose my connection more frequently, but that could be my service (Sprint), which I think I will drop come contract renewal time. I've never had a headset before, so I don't know how this one would compare. Still don't think that the ear-piece should have broken so quickly. You have to remove it in order to charge the headset, so taking it on and off, didn't help."
4,A good headset,"Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Wireless Headset (Black)I am really satisfied with this product and these were the pros and cons of it:Pros: Loud enough, nicely placed and easy to use buttons, light weight and comfortable. It also comes with an ear loop (does the job), if you are not comfortable with the in-ear buds.Cons: The only bad things I found are its battery life and it the microphone is not very clear in a windy environment.But as it does has an added advantage of small size and light weight, battery has to be compromised. So, if 4 hours of talk time is enough for you, then go for it."
4,"Great product, great quality","First BT device, no issues whatsoever, however I'm not a daily user. Perfect size for me (don't like large chunks of electronics hanging off side of face, not a Borg).:)"
1,Samsung WEP200 headset earhook is worthless,"The earhook on the Samsung WEP200 is made of cheap plastic. It has to be removed to charge the headset. When it is replaced onto the headset, the plastic breaks. The earhooks can be purchased separately, but at $1-2 each, it would cost several hundred dollars a year to keep an earhook on the headset. Very poor design engineering!"
5,Great Product,"I bought this bluetooth Headset to use it with my computer, with Voip programs. It works just great. It's tiny, you can carry it everywhere. It fits and stays in my ear (and I usually have problems with any earphones). After a little while you just forget you are wearing it. I used it at home so I don't know how it behaves in outdoor situations. The only ""problem"" is that the mic is really powerful, so if you are doing something noisy the person on the other side is going to hear anything.It is overall a great and affordable product."
4,Best Bluetooth Headset I Have Tried Out of 4 Headsets,"Super Small, Lightweight, Sleek, Best Sound Quality I TriedBeyond 15 Feet, Sound Begins To DegradeThe best of the 4 I tried. The earpiece is lightweight - you forget it's in your ear after a while. You feel it in your ear at first and it's not as comfortable as the Plantronics earpieces, but after a minute, you forget it's in your ear and it feels fine. The sound seemed to work well. It began to degrade at around 15 feet, but out of the 4 I tried, it was the best at 8 feet, 12 feet, and 15 feet. It was the clearest by far. It was the only one that worked at any sort of distance. It comes with a little, black, metal carrying case, which is also what is used to charge it. It is super small and very light. It's also very sleek looking."
2,Couldn't get it to stay in my ear,I tried all the different ear piece sizes but was unable to get it to stay in either ear. My low rating is based on this and not actual performance of the headset.
1,It'll Cost You!!,"While the features of the device work fine, the ear hook will break EVERY OTHER TIME you charge the device! Unbelievable how cheap the ear hooks are, and what a poor design this is. I just finished with an additional 10-pack of ear hooks, and am joyfully throwing this one away and buying something new!"
3,It's Average,"I am overall satisfy with its performance, but it could be much better. For instance, when the unit is turned on for the first time (daily), you need to make an outbound call first before the mouth piece picks up the voice. Once that's done, the unit should work fine the rest of the day. Also, it picks up surrounding noise easily. When making a call, make sure you are in a quiet area, otherwise, it'll find the wrong contact to dial. The ear-piece can become loose and falls out some times, so it's good to shove it in every once in a while. Other than those complains, the unit is small and easy to use."
4,"Pretty cool, discreet headset.","My husband loves these headsets because he can talk on the phone without obviously having a bluetooth on. It is really small and you have to get used to how small it feels, but after that.. it is really a great headset. The only bad thing is that it is so small that it is VERY easy to lose!!"
4,Fit,The reception both sending and receiving is great. The small size is great. The only problem that I had was the fit to my ear. It will not stay put on my ear. I jury rigged a pipe cleaner to ring around my ear. This works fine and is comfortable.
3,No warning,"After wearing this headset, I realize that it does not give you a warning signal that alerts you that you are out of range. Also the earpiece feels somewhat uncomfortable because you have not additional support to assure you that the piece will not fall out. Also after wearing it for a couple of days, I realized that I acquired a rash. I don't know what type of materials were used to make this product, but it gave me an allergic reaction."
3,Great Performance! Very Poor Fitting!!,"In terms of performance, this is a winner. Great reception and clarity. But the problem with this product is that it cannot fit in your ear. Even when it does fit, it falls off your ear when you laugh, talk, walk, run, jump, etc. Any movement will cause it to drop. Even with the ear hook, the problem becomes fragility. The device remains in place when used with the hook. The ear hook breaks very easily. To charge the device you need to detach the ear hook from it. You will loose an ear hook for every 10 charges at the least. Absolutely poor design concept. Great looks though."
4,Small... but sound quality is average,"Small, good range and functions, good kit and accessories, but sound quality is average. For the price it's ok, for the looks and style, its great."
1,"Great sound, but won't stay in your ear.","What good is a good clear sound when the headset won't stay in your ear? I have tried all the ear pieces it came with and I cannot get this thing to stay in my ear for more than 30 seconds. As a matter of fact it has already fallen out twice. If Samsung could figure out a better way for this to stay in your ear, I would be all over it. I'm just glad I didn't spend more than I did on it."
3,Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth,"I've used it for only a few times. I tried the small size ear sponge, but it keeps falling. I tried the medium size, my ears started to hurt after a while. It doesn't have the loop to hold on to the ear, it doesn't have the security feeling.It's small and light weight for sure."
5,Great Earbud,I purchased this earbud because I wanted to be handsfree with my cellphone in the car. It has worked great. The battery last all day long. I highly recommend this earbud.
4,Great little unit,"Excellent sound quality, convenient size, comfortable fit. Charging connector is different from that on Samsung phones so dont lose it."
1,"Good Sound, but no mp3?!?!","Ok, I got this bluetooth as a christmas gift. I always wanted to get a bluetooth, but can not decide which one to get. It was pretty easy to set up my bluetooth and connect with my sony ericsson w580i. It works pretty good, i could hear my friend clearly, and vice versa. The only problem is one it gets irratating sometimes(there are also times i forget that its there) and another problem would be it does not connect my mp3 with it. My friend has the same bluetooth but a nokia 5300 and it plays her songs through the bluetooth. I am not as statisfy as i thought i would be since i finally got a bluetooth. I am thinking about getting another one. which do you guys recommend?"
1,I was all set to buy,and these valid criticisms stopped me in my tracks. $.99 for a loop that doesn't last a week? What a racket. Not for me.
1,"Nice Looking, but virtually useless, unless you are looking to glue your hand to your ear","Pretty product. Matches Samsung's A900 (which is a great product) but requires you to hold in your ear with your hand 100% of the time....why buy a headset?Headsets should be hands free. Going back to my Motorola H700 even with it's crappy performance, at least it stays on your ear....I really expect better from Samsung. Very disappointing."
2,"Great Fit, Horrible Sound Quality","Got the WEP200 a week ago to go with my new Samsung phone. Seemed very small and I'd figure I'd give it a shot. Frankily I have no idea why people would give this headset a good rating. While is is super comfortable (to the point where you forget it is in your ear) it's sound quality is very very bad. My Moto HS850 whoops it in that department.The only way I could see people liking it is if they use it in doors, with no one else around and no back round noise whatsoever. But even then the HS850 is way better. The Range is also lousy.Overall my conclusion is that bigger is still better in the bluetooth world. I am returning my samsung midget today and I am thinking about the Jabra JX-10, the Jawbone or maybe the Moto HS700. Good luck!"
4,Great Gift Item,"I purchased this as a gift for someone, and they couldn't be happier with it! Great item at a great price."
2,Not lovin' it...,"I read a lot of very positive reviews about this headset and purchased one. I've been very disappointed with the WEP200. It doesn't stay in my ear well, often disconnects randomly from my phone, and people on the other end tell me my voice sounds muffled. The maximum volume is also very low. I've been using it with a Blackberry 8130. My girlfriend tried using a WEP200 with her Sanyo Katana and it didn't work well for her either. Similar problems.I've had much better success with Scala and Bluespoon headsets. My old Motorola H850 works better than this."
3,good but the ear hook is brittle,"working is relly fine, having good sound quality, but the ear hook is brittle, for me the ear hook broked while removing."
4,"Clear sound, light weight","As with others, the over the ear hook broke on the second use. I don't need it to keep the headset in my ear though. It stays in for hours at a time. I have to take it out when eating though, or it will fall out! I use it with a Samsung Eternity cell and have no problems connecting or with the sound volume or clarity. People on the other end don't know it's a headset. It has been nice to speeddial the last number called without taking out the phone to dial."
2,Annoying all around,"There are some very annoying aspects to this ear piece. First, as others have stated, the ear loop is extremely flimsy and only lasted about a month. I don't know what Samsung was thinking, but you have to snap the ear loop on and of every single time you want to charge it. And thats another annoying feature. Number one it does not use the same charge cord as Samsung phones, so you have to take both with you if you're going away. Nokia uses the same cord. On top of that, the ear piece has to fit inside a charging device that connects to the cord. So the ear loop must be removed each time. And you have to use the ear loop since the ear piece does not stay in your ear at all... Sound quality is ok but not enough to make up for the shortcomings."
3,Stylish but insecure,It looks awesome with the size and it's design. Also the soundquality is the best one that I had so far (probably owned 4 other bluetooth headsets). The only thing is that I can't really make it sit comfortably in my ear. Tried all sizes and positions. It always falls off my ear after a couple of minutes.
2,Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Earpiece,"I like the product, however none of the supplied ear piece adapters fit my ear. The earpiece would continually fall out regardless of how I positioned the adapters. I ended up using a Jabra ear gel from an old ear piece I had. It fits the Samsung unit but it has to be positioned just right so it doesn't block the sound from the speaker. If set up just right it seems to work alright, but I certainly wouldn't buy another one. The function is good, but the fit is terrible."
2,Inoperative after 2 months (battery won't hold charge),"I've never dropped this tiny headset or abused it (I've done the opposite, in fact), but after two months, the battery just won't seem to hold a charge, so now it's just a paperweight. I believe Samsung has a 1-year warranty on this item, so I'll try to contact them about a replacement. My wife has the exact same headset she's owned about a month longer, and it's still running fine--and she did drop hers!"
4,Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth is very light and comfortable,"It is easy to forget that you are wearing the Samsung Bluetooth. Unlike other models, when not in use, it fits easily in your pocket. The battery life is more than adequate. On the downside, I've had the unit fall out of my ear when running across a street. It has also fallen out when I yawned. Otherwise, I would certainly recommend this product."
4,Not much to complain,works like a charm (even @ 10 feet away - sometimes I forget that I have to have the phone w/ me). setup was easy. one thing setup didn't tell you was about the passcode to the device. had to google the result but after that it was a breeze to setup. phone (Razor) remembers the device and just push the button on the head piece and it re-connects. only issue is that I get a slight headache when I have it in my ear for extended periods (especially when not talking - might just be me or having deprived one ear of sound makes the head go funny).
1,Samsung blue tooth,the purchase went through dino direct via Amazon. I have had this bluetooth before and was satisfied..unfortunately these two never worked.Takes an act of God to find an english speaking cust service rep.
1,Malfunctioning device,"I have purchase quite a few of these Bluetooth over the years. I found that this one came faulty from the factory. This is no reflection whatsoever on the seller, just on the product review team. They should have done a better job f testing, prior to shipping it to the sellers. I do not like Blutooth devices that have the wire that goes around your ear. I find this very uncomfortable. I Love the in-ear Bluetooth. If any one can recommed similar ones, please do so.I had to return it to Amazon, and I am now skeptical of buying another one, although I need it. I have Bluetooth in my car(Hate using it)Thanks"
2,warped,"This is the third time i have purchased this product with first two going bad for one reason or another. I like the simplicity and ease of use and price. However, right out of box this time, the bluetooth had a speaker distortion which has yet to clear up. I can only attribute it to mfg defect. Will not order another or return as i assume i get what i pay for.."
2,Great sound but wouldn't stay in my ear,"This is the first earpiece I've tried with my phone. I have a Samsung phone and the sound quality was excellent. Perhaps it was the fact that it was in my ear, but the sound quality was much clearer than with the over-the-ear piece that I also tried. I had a problem with this repeatedly falling out of my ear. I ended up returning it because it would not stay in my ear. I have yet to find an earpiece with sound as good. Each person's ears are going to be different, and if this will stay in your ear I highly suggest it."
2,Very Low volume when used with Samsung SCH-a930 cell phone,"I haven't had much luck with this headset. I thought a Samsung headset would work well with a Samsung SCH-a930 (Verizon cell phone), but it doesn't -- the volume is very low. I can only hear people on the other end when I am at home where it is quiet. The volume is too low for my BMW, even when the headset and phone volume is turned all the way up, so it is not very usable for me. Another problem I have is that battery life is pretty short. Also, it does not stay in my ear very well."
3,not bad...,"Pros:1. SMALL... I really hate looking at people with gigactic headsets hanging out of their ear, and this one is definitely small enough to hide.2. Other people have commented on how this earpiece sometimes feels as if it might fall of their ear. I have never had that problem, and my ears aren't very small.Cons:1. I don't really get great connectivity with this thing. Granted this is my first bluetooth earpiece, it seems like I shouldn't have static while my phone is in my pocket and only a few feet from my head.2. Short Battery life. I guess it's about 4 hours, which may or may not be enough for you.3. Can become uncomfortable after long periods of time. After a couple hours of wearing this thing it actually starts to hurt. I would imagine that could be because I have a bulbous rubber and plastic thing jammed in my ear canal, but this is only a problem after 3 or 4 hours. Usually it's not that bad."
5,this thing is unbelievably amazing,"don't let the image fool you to think it's boxy and bulky. It's actually smaller than my girly thumb. It's so light when inserted into my ear that it's definitly not a strain, the charger/case is amazingly smart, and effective! It works great, and the quality is great. For this price range, I don't know what else to ask for. It's compact, and smart. It's so small, people WILL wonder if you are talking to your self. I've rarely felt so compelled to write a review because I was amazed."
1,Terrible Ear Clip,"The bluetooth itself is o.k., but the ear clip that comes with it is cheap and breaks. Purchased this item twice and each time the ear clip broke in the same place."
4,May be small but delivers!,"I wanted this headset because of its small size, and it indeed is very compact and light. The sound quality is good, after an hour or so the headset begins to hurt my ear, battery life so-so. Overall if you are looking for a small bluetooth headset this will fill your needs."
2,Totally Dissatisfied,"I returned this ultra small, good sounding bluetooth ear-piece. It just would not stay in my ear...under no circumstances would it remain in place. The slightest move & out it fell. And, when I did get it to stay for a few minutes, it was only b/c I jammed it in so hard that my ear would start to hurt. After 3 days of using it my ear was terribly sore. In short, if this thing fit it would be an easy 4.5 or 5 stars, but the fact it does not kills any possible upside"
1,Background noise,There is a humming sound everytime I use it. I have tried it with a PC using a USB bluetooth dongle and on my Smartphone. Same noise. My Plantronics Discovery unit does not produce this sound.This is cheap in price for a reason.
5,Excelent,"Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Headset Kit (Samsung Retail Packaging)Very good product, i received on time at cheap price and i'm very happy with it."
2,volume very low,This product does not fit in my ear and the volume does not get loud enough when you are in a moderately noisy place.
3,bluetooth,This is a great product and works very well. It was delivered on time. My only complaint is that Amazon advertised a rebate with it and the paperwork did not arrive with the product. I had to e-mail Amazon and request instructions. They were cooperative but I still have not received my rebate.
1,useless,"compact, charger is its carrying case, but incompatible with any of my Samsung or LG cell phones. Purchased it early and gave it as a christmas gift, so my 30 day period for returning it expired."
3,Product is fine....service was not,The package I received did not contain all the parts listed. Samsung wouldn't help as the product was sold directly by Amazon. It was not a big enough issue to return the product but it is inconvenient and annoying that there is no way to resolve this kind of situation other than returning the whole package.
3,My first bluetooth,"I got this headset because I have a Samsung phone and the reviews looked good. The sound on my end is clear and volume is good. Sometimes others get a lot of noise, especially when I'm in my car (which in all fairness isn't the quietest). Sometimes others hear an echo. The one thing that I really didn't like is the headset just did not stay in my ear. They send that little black loop thing to help it stay, but you have to take that off to charge it and it is very fragile. Needless to say I broke that pretty quick. I had an eargel from a previous phone and it doesn't fall out now and it didn't compromise the sound qualilty at all. The range is pretty good, 25 or 30 feet if I remember, but sometimes when my phone is in my pocket or in an odd place I get some static. That is usually fixed by some kind of repositioning. All in all I like it, but I would recommend buying eargels with it rather than later."
4,Samsung Black Bluetooth,"The price is good for the quality of product. The charging case is nice, and the headset is stylish. It came with several ear buds and one ear loop. Samsung made something good and cheap, but don't expect it cover over 20 ft separation between headset and phone.I have had at least two signal failures during a conversation, but the call does not end it simply transfers to the phone. It's just like a phone, it will work most of time with an aberrant malfunction."
2,DANG THAT HURTS!,"That was my reaction whenever I tried to stick this thing in my ear. I don't know what is wrong with the people who are designing ear-pieces but I am starting to suspect that they have a deep hatred of mankind.I could never get it stuck into my right ear (the one I preferred) and I had to be feeling awfully masochistic to get it seated into my left. The little nub is somewhere between the size of a nickel and a quarter with absolutely no kind of allowance made for the natural size, shape and construction of the human ear. And the little plastic bit that is supposed to help you get it seated is just a waste of plastic.After that, the sound was good, the battery life was good and it worked exactly as advertised with no other problems. Just that one big one.Just to tell you, I wasn't really very upset when mine got run over by a truck."
3,Looks great!!!,"This product is worth it. It has got the stylish look and has got very good features. The only bad part is the charge, it stays no longer than 2hrs of continuous talking. And the charger is not really compatible with the bluetooth, it doesnt fit in properly.Overall- its worth 30$ I have spent on it."
2,"Good Product, Cheap parts","The Bluetooth itself is very good, but the Earhook (wich you have to clip on/off to let the headset charge ) is very weak, mine broke after the second time i went to rechage the bluetooth headset... if you want to buy this product, wich is excellent, buy some spare earhooks just in case."
1,Worthless,"I've been through two of these units and both had serious problems. The first unit worked fine (good volume and I could be understood by the other caller), however, it couldn't hold a charge after the first day. I had ordered a second unit for my girlfriend and it will not bind to her or my phone. I returned the first unit and will be returning the second one as well."
4,nice headset,"This headset is small and comfortable. Works well except when it is windy out. I use it both with my cell and laptop (for skype) with no problem. There are a lot of fakes for sale out there, so make sure you buy it from a reputable retailer like Amazon."
1,SMALLEST PIECE OF CRAP IN THE WORLD!!!,"I THINK I SHOULD BECOME AN ENGINEER FOR SANYO BECAUSE IF THEY CAN DESIGN CRAP LIKE THIS THEN I AM A SHOE IN TO BE THEIR HEAD ENGINEER.THE EAR PIECE MUST HAVE BEEN TESTED ON THE EAR CANAL OF A GORILLA AND WHO DOESN'T WARRANTY A SMALL PIECE OF RUBBER THAT COSTS LESS THAN A TOOTHPASTE CAP?GREAT IDEA AND THE UNIT HAS LOTS OF POTENTIAL, BUT I AM SURE THAT IT WILL BE UNREALIZED. AND I WOULD HAVE BETTER LUCK HOUSE TRAINING A WOLVERINE THAN TRYING TO GET ANY HELP WITH SANYO CUSTOMER SERVICE."
4,Good product for the price,"Product arrived on time but the package was open,meaning it was not sealed as you expect when you buy in a store, working till now though.Its really worth having. has a wide range and clarity. I should also mention that it is my first bluetooth set."
2,Ouch!,"I gave it a shot and tried it for 2 weeks. The earpiece would either not stay in my ear (I tried several angles on the loop) or would hurt it so badly that I couldn't stand it. Normally, I'd chalk that up to ""strange ear syndrome"", but everyone I spoke to while using it complained of static and loud ambient noise with the Treo 680 (no static w/o the headset). I took it back."
3,EAR PIECE,"I LIKE THE EAR PIECE, IT IS LITE BUT DOES NOT STAY IN YOUR EAR AS I WOULD LIKE IT TO. IT IS CLEAR AT MOMENTS BUT SOME TIME'S I HAVE TO PUT MY PHONE NEAR IT TO GET A BETTER RECEPTION. AND I FEEL IT SHOULD HAVE COME WITH A CAR CHARGER. WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF IT I THOUGHT IT WAS TO BE PLACED IN YOUR EAR LIKE A EAR PLUG AND I ALSO THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TO USE THE EAR CANAL TO RECEIVE THE TONE OF VOICE. I THINK THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANOTHER EAR PIECE I HAD LOOKED AT, BUT ALL IN ALL IT IS OK."
3,Problem pairing with Samsung D807,"I'm having problem pairing this device with my Samsung D807. Does anyone have any idea on this? The phone does not find it while searching for bluetooth devices...IT IS WORKING NOW!!! Thanks, so happy with my headset, I take back the 3 stars and give 5!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as good as I expected!!!,The reception is no better than my other head sets. Ear piece will fall out when you eat.
1,"Terrible product, I regret this purchase","This is one of the worst headsets I have ever used. It does not fit in ear well, the sound is extremely tinny, like you are inside a tin can. Every time I'm on a call people have issues hearing me, and complain that it sounds like I am fading in and out. The way the earpiece fits into the charging case does not work well, it often does not actually connect and won't charge. I used to use the Scala 500 by Cardo, it was the best I have used, but they don't make it anymore unfortunately. Save you money on this one, it is only worth about $7."
2,cheap ear loop,I agree with the other person that said the ear loop was cheaply made...mine snapped after only two charges...I read the reviewers comments about the loop and was very careful but it still snapped anyway...The unit itself works pretty well but doesn't stay in my ear very well and mostly falls out without the loop...not impressed...
3,"Great little headset, terrible design for the ear hook piece","I've got no complaints about the operation, sound quality, battery life, or design of the actual headset itself. For the price, it works very well, and syncing with my iPhone was a cinch. However, what would've been a five-star rating got trimmed down to three when the second time I removed the ear hook piece to charge the headset resulted in the plastic part that snaps on to the headset breaking off. I can still wear the headset by lodging it gently in the ear, but can't really walk or engage in any physical activity without it falling out. You can get replacement ear hook pieces from Samsung, but why bother when it'll most likely break off after a couple of uses?"
2,Great sound and clarity however,"The earbud is uncomfortable, and the detachable ear hook breaks when you take it off in order to recharge the headset. Total design flaw right there. The sound clarity and range is great, but the hook problem is what prevents this headset from being perfect."
4,Almost perfect for me...,"Good sound, small size, good price but the headset would not stay in my ear unless I purchased the Jabra eargels as stated in other reviews. Otherwise I would have to buy another headset that fits over the ear which can interfere with glasses."
4,"Clear voice, small compact design","The WEP200 is much better than the Motorola I had.The voice is much clear and the ear piece is closer to the ear canal.The only complaint is it takes longer to turn on, need to hold on theheadset for several seconds. But can always leave it on.The battery life lasts longer than Motorola."
5,Good little headset--but don't bake it in your car.,Great little headset for my use. I had to buy a replacement because I left it in my car on a very hot day and it got baked.
4,Fine for the price.,"This was my first BT headset. I use it in the car. I'm happy with how it works, except perhaps the volume level is not too high, hence the 4 stars (but who goes by stars, anyway). I have to turn the music off, and roll up the windows. Some calls are louder than others, naturally.I'm not sure what more money gets you in a BT headset, but this one is fine for me.EDIT: Upon further inspection, there seems to be excess leather extending beyond the seam on the inside of the case, precisely on the button side. A sharp blade should take care of it. I probably just got a slightly out of spec model."
1,It stopped working after 1 month and a few days,The first Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth I purchased worked just fine until I lost it a year after I purchased it. The second one I purchased stopped working after a month and a few days.
2,if you don't mind a sore ear...,"It hurts your ear if you wear it so that it won't fall out with a slight breeze. I'm going to get the kind that lays against your ear, not in it. Also can't hear the ring announcement with the windows down in the car."
5,"Compact, worthy, excellent piece of equipment","my husband really likes the Samsung Bluetooth he lost his first one and he got another kind as a gift and he didnt wanted i had to give him mines, very comfortabl in the ear, good sound, very small and discreet, durable"
2,Disappointed in Other Review Comments,"the price was right, but it keeps falling out of my ear even with the attachment."
4,Great for the price,"Great device, especially for the price. My Only complaint is that I wish the volume was a little louder (this could also be a problem with my phone and not the headset). It works extremely well and seems to hold a great charge between infrequent uses. [...]"
1,"weak product,poor quality","I've given up on these bluetooth devices, to me they have all been garbage, with poor sound quality , static and loss of signal from room to room , this samsung is no different from all the other products i have tried, i couldn't recommend this at any price."
2,works well but...,this thing isn't comfortable at all...and doesn't stay on my ear worth a darn.It has good connection quality...but I can barely use it.
5,Best Bluetooth!,This is by far the best Bluetooth headset i have ever owned. I bought this headset about 3 years ago and I still use as my everyday headset. I have purchased two or three headsets in that 3 years and I always go back to this one in less than a week.
4,Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth - works great,"Easy to use - small, comfortable to wear - great clarity - holds charge for long time - charges quickly"
2,Cheap small device; doesn't perform well,"After putting myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technologythrough our washing machine, I thought I'd purchase a cheap $20 replacement. The Plantronics Voyager 510 was a little large but I was always satisfied with the voice quality and fit on my ear. The Samsung WEP200 does not compare in function to the Voyager 510. I never could get it to attach to my ear and stay there. Nor was the sound quality very good. Overall, Samsung makes great LCD TVs and decent printers. This device, like their Blu-Ray players, is lacking in function and performance. I returned it to Amazon for a refund and will buy another Voyager 510."
5,Good things often come in small packages,"I had seen this bluetooth headset in an airport and did not buy it because it was overpriced - being in an airport shop and all. After searching for it, I finally found it at a very reasonable price on Amazon. I have been using it for the last few weeks and am very satisfied with the performance of this bluetooth headset. It is very compact, easy to use and the sound is very clear. I would recommend this headset to anyone that is looking for a small headset. Another feature that I really like is that it does not have the over the ear clip for holding the headset to your ear. The little earbud is much more comfortable for me. I cannot stand having over the ear type clips, so this headset was perfect for me."
4,good and inexpensive,This headset is easy to use and works well. The main problem I had with it was the ear piece would not fit/stay in my ear without the hook (included). It is still comfortable and light with the hook but would have been nice without it. The sound level is plenty loud and the battery lasts for a week on 30-45 min use per day.
2,Poor Fit,The sound quality of the WEP200 is actually very good but I cannot get the thing to stay in my ear...finally gave the earpiece to a friend.
2,samsung wep200,IT IS NOT SO COMFORTABLE TO USE - IT NEEDS SOMETIME TO FAMILIER WITH THE PRODUCT AND ALSO THE STAND IS BROKEN THE FIRST DAY AND IT IS HARD ALL THE TIME TO FIND THE BOX FOR CHARGING THE BLUETOOTH
3,wont stay in my ear,This headset is decent as far as sound quality and looks but it will not stay in my ear. My wife has one too and has no problem keeping it in her ear so it must be different for different people. Thats my only problem and thats big enough for me to be looking for another headset as we speak.
5,Excellent Purchase,This blue tooth met all it's advertising promises. Very good sound quality and reasonably priced. Delivered promptly.
3,"Works fine, but ear loop problem","I had no problem linking my headset with my Motorola RAZR cell phone. Operation with my cell phone was acceptable. However, the little plastic ear loop didn't work to keep the headset on my ear. If I leaned over, it fell off. Then, the fragile plastic loop broke off as I was removing it to charge the headset battery. You have to remove the loop every time you charge the battery, so you will have lots of opportunity to break the fragile loop. This was perhaps only the third time I was charging the battery since I had it for such a short time.I called Samsung and they quickly recognized the description of my problem and said they would send me a couple more of the ear loops, no charge. When the headset goes out of warranty and all the loops are broken, I guess I'll just have to throw the headset away."
4,Good Product,"I've been pleased with the headset with the exception of the earpiece. As others, I went to Radio Shack and bought the Jabra ear gels. Like it very much now except I have to remove the ""ear gels"" to charge this. Other than that it works great!"
4,Samsung bluetooth,"Good product at a great price. Pros: you can hear good, they can hear you good, setup is easy, it's small and not noticable, charges quickly and probably doesn't use that much battery to begin with. Cons: the ear piece hurts!! The 'cushion' helps hold it in a little, but not much. The poster who advised to buy the Jabra eargels is on to something. However, it stays in good enough as is, it's just pretty uncomfortable, and that's fixable with eargels. Final commemt: Worth every penny. I purchased it from a reccomendation, and I will reccommend it as well. Get eargels."
3,It was almost love,"This headset was my all time favorite. It fit it in my ear perfectly and was so light I barely felt it and usually forgot I even had it on. I personally doubt that it would fit every person's ear though, it doesn't seem like it's terribly adjustable. The reason I could only give this headset three stars however is because of how fragile it is. I have a Plantronics Discovery 650 and I couldn't tell you how many times I've dropped that tiny headset but it never faltered. The WEP200 fell only once and that was it, it was broken. It was knocked from a table only about 4 ft. high. Granted, if you put the headset in a secure location where it has no chance of falling this would not be an issue to you but I think the majority of people stand a good chance of dropping their headset even if that chance is when it falls out of their ear accidentally. I would love another of these headsets but I wouldn't waste the money for myself."
1,samsung WEP200,Hate it. Does not fit ear; actually hurts. The ear hook broke the 1st week. Continuously having to take the ear hook off to charge makes no sense. Very disappointed.
2,This one is ok,I did not care for this bluetooth because it is too small and does not fit or stay in my ear the thing they give you to go with it does not fit my ear either it seems to be a good quality brand but just does not fit my ear so for me I do not care for it.
1,I can't get it to charge,"I'd write a review if I could get it to work. When I plug the charger I get a fast-flashing red light. It has been like that for hours and the blue light never comes out. If I take it out from the charger it doesn't matter how long I press the button, it just won't work."
4,"Almost Two Years Old and Still Using, Fit Could Be Better","Bought this almost two years ago. Volume is okay. Sometimes my phones have not ""discovered"" it when it was on, but I actually think that is more an issue with my phones. I've had issues with it staying in my ear. I do not use the additional over-the-ear piece (I'm sure that would help)."
3,Gets the job done.,Product works okay. Clarity is not the greatest. I have a hard time hearing when I use it in my car or other noisy environments.
3,Works Great Until It Falls Apart,"This headset works GREAT and was perfect for the money BUT..... the part that goes onto the ear to hold it in place fell apart in less than a month of minimal use. Our only option is to buy a replacement part which is fine if the product was used for longer than one month of minimal use. If you are willing to buy replacement parts than this is a good headset. Otherwise, go with a better made product."
4,Great earpiece,I have always liked the samsung wep200. This is a great earpiece. I have not had any issues pairing this earpiece with any phone. The only downside to this earpiece is the range. Normal bluetooth range is roughly about 30 ft. This earpiece i get about 5 - 10 ft. Overall if you want a small earpiece that works well. This is the earpiece for you.
3,Not bad for the money but...,Doesn't stay in the ear so well. Also a little hard to hear. Otherwise OK.
4,Good product for the price,pros: nice productcons: have to remove earpiece holder each time it needs to be charged
1,WEP200 Bluetooth,The volume on this earpiece is not good and it doesn't fit well at all. The part that goes over the ear broke after three days. I don't care for this earpiece at all.
3,"Great piece. picks up background noise, and hard to keep in ear w/o hook.","This is overall a Great piece.Cons: picks up background noise, people get annoyed when i am doing things while talking (ie. wrapping a gift, cleaning my room).It is hard to keep in ear w/o hook. I eventually lost my hook, so the earpiece will fall out of my ear (I have big ears)."
4,Pleasant discovery,"I rarely use cell phone for personal needs, so I mostly use it when I connected to some conference calls. The head set has very nice features for my usage pattern:1. It has mute button with acceptance signal2. It can redial last number3. It can use voice functions from telephoneNo one more expensive headset had these very important functions for me.My complains only to the headset is not so long battery life and slightly uncomfortable fit, although headset is extremely light."
5,Tiny and Awesome,"The sound is clear,the controls are easy, the talk time is adequate and the charge time is short. It's small enough to hide under my hair! I am very glad I went with this headset."
4,"small size, works well","the only thing I don't like is how it is charged, which requires detaching the U-shape thing (ear hanger!) from it and putting it in its charger"
4,Get lots of extra ear hooks,The earpiece itself works great and is comfortable but you do need the ear hook to hold it onto your ear. The ear hook is very flimsy and broke within a couple of weeks.
3,Good handset but has a big flaw,"I do like the overall quality of the handset but it has a big flaw, it seems to be a half-duplex device, it means that the sound can only travel in onde direction at the same time so when the person on the other side of the line is talking or making noises he/she won't be able to hear what I'm saying. The biggest problem comes when the other person is in a noisy environment, in that case the person on the other side of the line won't be able to understand anything I say."
4,Very Good Product,This small but powerful device is just what I was looking for. Inserts comfortably in your ear. Works as well as the larger models
3,Samsung Bluetooth,"Product works great, but need something that has more noise reduction. No real complaints about this."
4,nice,Arrived on time. Product has a volume problem. Too loud and cannot turn down the volume. Cannot keep it on the ears and has a tendency to fall off otherwise I like the idea that I can listen to music on my miMP3 player without having wires attached to the phone with mp3 player.
2,Not a very good headset for LG phones,"My wife and I bought 2 of these headsets to use with our LG phones. Unfortunately, both have been returned. A lot of static, not being able to hear the other person on the other end, and sometimes listening to voicemail- it would speed up the message to the point you could not understand the message."
4,Good while it lasted,"I have a special standard for Bluetooth devices. I've had several of them over the last few years. This one is the lightest, and worked well for about a year. Then it stopped. It's been my experience with Bluetooth listening devices that a year is all you can expect, at best. Right now I use a Motorola from Costco that's on it's 4th month. We'll see how long it lasts."
4,Almost Perfect,"This little bluetooth is AWESOME - the clarity is wonderful - no more sounding like you're in a tunnel... the only thing I had a problem with was the ear adjustment. No matter what size I tried, it wouldn't stay in my ear. I finally bought some Jabra ear gels & put the appropriate size on the end of the bluetooth. Now, it's perfect!"
3,WEP200,"Pros: Easy to wear. Seems to stay in the ear and is comfortable. When the phone is close has a nice clear sound. Inexpensive.Cons: Some static if the fone is more than 2 feet away. The voice recognition is unrecognizable, can't understand anything it says and it doesn't dial whom you request. Best if you either dial or use the phonebook function.This is my first wireless headset for my cell phone and I feel that if I spent another $20 I would have done much better. I am sort of satisfied with the WEP200 since I haven't used another wireless headset."
4,Great Compact Headset,"Compact, lightweight, good sound quality, excellent battery life. This headset meets all the needs I have. I purchased it when looking for a device to use during my commute and while working at a computer. The in-ear design takes some getting used to and may not be comfortable for some users however if you use ear buds for music I'd say you would find it similar. At times I forget I'm wearing this headset it's so lightweight. For charging the earpiece is placed in a small case that is excellent for storage. The battery life is more than adequate for my hour commute and the controls are prominent so they're easy to use while driving. I would highly recommend this headset."
5,Great Product,Fast shipment from CCMC Accessories. Great Price! It works really well and people can't even tell I am on a bluetooth. I use it with my LG Chocolate the old version of it.
2,Basic Headset - fragile construction,"This is a basic headset, no noise cancellation. Ear loop is VERY fragile, and you have to remove it to charge the unit, so be very careful. You can't argue with the price, though. My loop broke and I called Samsung parts department and asked if they would send a new one for no charge - which they did. Good service once I got to the right person."
2,This Earpiece Sucks!!!,"I think I purchased a fake. The headset works great...it's a real lightweight...it functions well...has a sleek look... There's just ONE MAJOR PROBLEM: IT DOES NOT STAY IN MY EAR. 5 min. tops, then it falls out. It took me a week to figure out how the 'hook' on the ear bud is supposed to work. The 'snap in' ear hook that wraps around my ear can't even keep it in. Unless you got ears like DUMBO, do not buy this headset..."
2,Earpiece is too big,"I could not get this thing to stay in my ear - it would just pop right out even if I was sitting still and not moving my head. I've had corded headsets that came with different size attachments so one could customize the fit, but there's no way to adjust this thing. I stopped trying to use it after a week and ended up buying an over-the-ear model instead."
4,Nice headset...accessory could be better,"Love the headset and charger/carrying case. Ear hook broke in the first week...they should do without, or make it better. Good sound and perfect size. Large multi-function button is great"
3,Tough to keep in your ear.,"I bought this unit to replace my older Motorolla unit that hurt my ear and had horrible battery life and reception. This unit has much better battery life- even though it is smaller, and it also gets much better reception than the Motorolla.It is also more comfortable, as this unit fits INSIDE my ear- as opposed to the Motorolla unit that wrapped around my ear. However, it is a very fragile fit, and the unit falls out of my ear pretty easily.Bottom line from me is that it is more comfortable than the Motorolla, but it will fall out of your ear much more easily. I bought this unit to try it out- since it was so cheap, but I will probably go back to a ""wrap around the ear"" type model on my next unit"
4,Good device!,"I do like this ear piece. This is my second one because I lost the first one. It is tiny enough to lose, so I make sure to keep it in one place now. I don't know why there is a blue blinking light... that draws attention to your ear if you don't want it to. If it's in your ear, then you can't see the blue light anyway. I can hear people talk just fine and the people I talk to can hear me just fine."
3,OK,"I should have been for warned about the ear buds, they are far too big for my ears. I don't even use the ear bud, I use the plastic ear hook that it comes with. And the plastic ear hook looks like it won't last long, it's very flimsy. If you have ever had problems with earphones that are too big or uncomfortable then don't buy this bluetooth. Also, I had a very hard time hearing while driving, but that could have been a single incident (I've only used it once while driving so far). If it had a stronger ear hook I would give this 4 stars."
2,Horriable,The piece that goes over the ear breaks it should come with two or three of them. The sound quality is great but this is the second one that I have had that has broke. It is not just me I bought my mom and dad both one and their pieces broke also. Do not wast your money get a different one.
3,"Sound Great, but will it Fit? - that'll depend!","I've had my WEP200 for a couple of days now. Maybe I have odd shaped ears, but it does fall out. I've tried both ears (I really like in on the right side), and no matter what I try, it's never totally secure. The sound quality is very good, no complaints there.Mine is going back, I have to try something that'll be secure.Update: Switched to a Nokia headset which has a retaining wire to hold the headset in place. No longer falls out, so I'm happier. Several people at my place of work have this same Samsung WEP 200 and have not had any issues with fit. So I guess it's all down to genetics!"
2,I Give Up...,"OK, I give up. I guess I'm a slow learner as I cannot figure out how to keep the bloody thing in my ear. I have been chasing it all over the place all morning as it keeps falling out. I ""stick it in my ear"" (see instructions below) and a few minutes later it falls out. It's an endless loop and it never gets any better.All the instructions say is ""stick it in your ear."" End of instructions. So much for following directions, as I have done that dozens of times and I have tried sticking it in my ear with all 3 sizes of rubber earpiece covers that come with it and none of the 3 are any better at staying in ear than the others.I guess I will have to return it since I cannot keep it in my ear and off the floor. It did pair up nicely and it certainly is lightweight but none of that matters if it won't stay put."
1,"""Stick It In Your Ear"" - I dare you!","This accessory came highly recommended - and we do our homework! Unfortunately, we'll never know how well it works, because neither my husband nor I could manage to get the earpiece into either of our ears. We completely agree with the review provided by Small Forest ""lionpol"" on 1-30-07. We've had to return it."
1,Beware compatibility,"I bought two of these for my LG EnV and my wife's Mortorola RazR and have been unable to get these bluetooth headsets to connect to either phone. Haven't called Samsung yet, but beware of connectivity problems."
2,"Clear sound, poor fit for small ears",This is a very small unit & the piece that fits in the ear is rather large. It is a very uncomfortable fit for my adult female ear. The over the ear loop must be removed for recharging. The button controls on the surface and sides of the unit are not difficult to use.I would not recommend this unit for anyone with smallish ears or large fingers.
3,If I could do it over again I'd buy...,a headset with an earhook.The earpiece is too small causing it to slip out of place easily and frequently.
2,fragile equipment,"at first i was in love with this headset.it was a great headset, the one thing i hated about it is how it just pops into your ear like the earbud headphones. like the head phones those things never stay in. they will stay in if you aren't doing anything too active. but try to move your head while its in and it'll drop out of your ear. mine dropped and after that it never worked the same again. the sound quality for receive and transmit has been severely degraded and therefore i can't use it anymore or return it due to the amazon return policy.if you buy it i recomment that you just use it if you are going to be stationary i.e, driving, sitting around."
3,Easy to use hand's free device,"I am thankful for a simple, hand's free device that allows me to make cell phone calls using voice commands. The voice recognition software is good and generally intuitive. It is not easy to use call-waiting with the hands free set as it usually hangs up on the person I'm talking to because of the single button on the device that does all of the functions. In addition, it doesn't fit well into my ear and it has fallen out a few times."
4,Bluetooth beauty,"Good sound quality, but takes a little getting use to if you have used devices with a overhand for the ear."
5,Nice headset priced right,"This bluetooth headset is tiny compared to others I've researched. I purchased it for my daughter, and she loves it. It paired easily with her Env2 Verizon phone. I called her to test it and I could hear her clearly and she reports she can hear well on it too. There was no feedback noise or echo. She reports that it is very comfortable, and she has been wearing it for long periods of time without a problem. The standby time is 70 hours, so it doesn't have to be constantly charging. Great product."
2,"Audio good, disappointed with the clip","At first, I was very pleased with this product. It was light and small. The only concern I had was the ear clip. I was thinking that the other reviews were unfounded because I was being careful.Unfortunately, I was wrong. The portion of the clip that attaches to the headset split inside of a week, sitting in my shirt pocket."
3,Earhook Moan,"This product works well until the ear hook breaks. I read a review (or maybe it was some reviews) that warned me about that. I just thought, ""I'll just have to be extra careful with that hook."" Alas, I failed. The hook broke right around where it connects to the device. I just ordered some Jabra ear gels so... <sigh>Other than that, it's tiny, light, cheap, and sounds just fine on both ends. All of which are useless if it won't stay in your ear!"
4,Good Value,"Good Blue Tooth, the ear loop broke with in first week, other than that the voice clarity is good. And, the person on the other side of also hears me clearely."
3,Its just OK,"It serves the purpose. But I still hear static in the bluetooth unless the phone is extremely close. I hear static when my phone is on my hip and I am walking. I have to put my phone clipped on my purse which is at my shoulder and has less movement I suppose. Its still not crystal clear. I also didn't receive different sized ear pieces from the seller, only the M. A friend who bought this from the store received a S, M and L. For someone with small ears, even the M is uncomfortable. So I am unable to just have the bluetooth in my ear waiting for a call. I have to put it on after a call comes through, so that takes away from the convenience."
4,"Good headset, value for money","Is a great headset, but the connecting ear part is so flimsy. It breaks so fast. Otherwise is great."
4,bluetooth,works good wene in car but you get outside where theres wind or noise. not so good the person on the other end not ably to hear you.
3,"Good voice quality, bad design",For the price this is a great little headset with good voice quality on both ends. The negative is that it won't stay in the ear and the ear hook is too flimsy to do any good with hanging it on the ear.
5,Samsung WEP 200 blue tooth,"I had this bluetooth before, but my kitten ate the power cord! I loved this so much, I bought a new one"
2,Earhook replacement policy,"The unit works fine electrically, but the earhook design is poor. Mine broke when I tried to reattach it after recharging the headset for only the second time.Samsung's warranty policy is atrocious. They do not cover ""breakage"" under their warranty and want $7 for a set of three replacement earhooks. Given the limited lifetime of these hooks, earhook replacement costs clearly will greatly exceed the cost of the headset over its lifetime."
4,nice little blutooth headset!,"This was a very nice bluetooth headset until I lost it. since it so small, I tuck it away and now I can't find it ;(. anyways, I had 2 great headset by Plantronics and samsung. both are very good, but if I had to choose, I would choose Samsung for it connects to my phone without too much hassle compare to plantronics 510 voyager, where I had to constantly reset my phone to get connect it. on the other hand Plantronics Voyager 510 voice is far superior to Samsungs (IMO)."
3,"Not too good, not too bad","First off, three stars on my scale means pretty decent. Am not going to waste your time with an extra elaborate review. One of the video reviews here should tell you that it fits well and does not fall off unless you are performing a circus act or riding a twisted roller coaster. The weight is also perfect. However, you need to make sure you do not bury your cellphone in your pockets under lot of other things. It hurts the reception. The battery back up is not the best, and wind is the biggest problem. IF YOU LIVE IN OKLAHOMA DO NOT BUY IT. If it gets windy, the other person can hardly hear anything."
1,Not worth the money,"Although the sound quality seems to be OK, I can not keep the darn thing in my ear. It falls out constantly, even when I am just sitting still in the car. Very aggravating."
2,Does not stay in ear,"This bluetooth falls out of my ear constantly. What's more annoying is that when I push it back in, I inevitably push the button to hang up. The behind-the ear addition breaks so easily that it isn't even worth buying a new one for 5 bucks (I knew it was fragile, as other had said so on reviews, so I was extra careful--still broke). I would not recommend this item."
2,Sound Quality is Poor,Complaints that I am hard to hear when I am talking very loud into the handset. I can barely hear anyone on speakerphone even when the volume is on as loud as possible - Disapointing.
4,Solid phone for the price,This is a good basic two line phone for someone who doesn't want the LCD. I have purchased many on these for our different locations.
2,Beep beep beep beep!,"I've had the phone several years, and I still can't figure out how to shut off the annoying beeps that sound every time I lift the handset or punch the speaker button. I found a reference on an ATT site that says ""This means your Telezapper is working."" Well, I don't own a Telezapper (which is supposed to be an external piece of technology). And I really don't care for the beeps.Does anyone know how to make them stop? If not, I'm going to chuck this phone and go back to Panasonic."
1,Faulty Product,I purchased this product from an Amazon vendor. Upon receipt I installed the product only to discover that it did not work.
2,Poorly organized,"I have been a medical technologist for 16 years and have taught immunology for 12 years in the classroom and clincial setting. This book is poorly organized and not relevant to the normal clinical lab. New terms for a med tech student are used in the first chapter and then defined in later chapters. There is an entire section on RID which only high volume reference labs use and is no longer recommended by ASCP to be covered in med tech schools. The lack of newer illustrations and photographs, and boring layouts of tables and charts is also a negative. I have actually given our students websites to refer to instead of sections in this book to complete their objectives.Signed MDM, MT(ASCP) SI"
1,Horribly written,"I am using this book for my immunology course for a clinical lab sciences program. This book does not explain things well at all. The paragraphs are composed of definitions defining more definitions and nothing is made clear. The organization doesn't make sense and is confusing. When it starts talking about values, it doesn't even explain what the values actually mean. The tables and graphs are not explained at all and are very unhelpful and even confusing/misleading sometimes. I think it's a horrible textbook for a 3000/4000 level immunology class. I had to constantly look up words and definitions because this book was just not clear at all."
3,Needs Correction and More Work,This book was required for a MT class. I have found several discrepencies in this book and errors in the review questions. I think this book would be confusing for someone without any background in immunology because it jumps around a lot and doesn't paint a very good picture. I wonder why my department chose this book.
1,Horrible book! I have taken 3 Immunology courses and this was the worst book ever! Do Not Buy!,I have taken 3 Immunology courses in my career and used many books. This by far the worst! I have more Immunology than doctors do and I couldn't understand it! I think it sucked out the knowledge that I did receive from previous courses out of my brain.
5,Perfect cereal bowl,"If you have kids, or if you're clumsy, this is the perfect cereal bowl. Although not optimal for hot soups, since you can't hold it in your hand without a mitt, it is perfect for cereal. Cleans up easy, takes up much less space than ceramic and it is definitely shatter-proof..."
5,My Most Useful Bowl,"I don't think I will be putting this bowl in the cabinet. I know I will have so many uses for it in the preparation of recipes for both cooking and baking. It is the perfect size for beating eggs, making glazes for cakes, combining ingredients, that I am sure I will use this bowl every day, every meal.11/30/11 Edited to add: I ordered a second bowl because I have come to depend on this bowl more and more. I put my eggs in this bowl while waiting for them to come to room temperature. The bowl is the perfect size to hold 4 eggs in their shells and there is enough room to cover them with water if you need to speed-up the process of getting your eggs to room temperature. I use these bowls all the time, for everything baking, cooking and even cleaning."
3,"Ok, but the author has issues...","The author obviously knows the Dredd universe well, and has written other books in the series which are good. This one however almost reads like an edition of ClassWar at times, various references to the Royal Family being inbred parasites, and bosses being evil exploiters of the masses leave us in no doubt as to his own political leanings, which is kind of a shame when it intrudes into the story. Overall though, a good read and worth buying, though I really cringed at the fact that he used the word ""defenestrated"" 3 times in the book, and got it wrong every time. It means to be thrown out of a window, from the french ""fenetre"" for window, it does *not* mean strangled. Buy a dictionary, Dave, and use a better proofreader."
2,Not so positive.,"I read this, and thought about my partner reading it, and it concerned me. It was a glimpse of being with someone with AS. However, it highlighted much of the negative aspects, and spoke about the relationships as if there weren't sustainable. I don't agree with that. And thought that it was speaking to AS more like a broken diseased part of a person that a partner may never be able to handle. Or they may never be fulfilled by their AS partner. I consider AS a blessing and a curse, just like any great personality strength, and do not believe that love and relationships are beyond the realm of someone with AS grasping. That's how this book made me feel for much of it. It seemed more like a commiseration of negative thoughts and feelings, more than a 'how to thrive and get what's best in these different yet sustainable and wonderful relationships'"
4,Good Book,Enjoyed reading this as my 47 year old husband was just diagnosed with Aspergers Disorder. It is written straight forward in easy to read language with lots of tips on coping. Would recommend it to anyone.
3,Useful... but not for me,"It's a very thorough book, but it focuses heavily on the problems a couple faces when one partner has AS, which isn't exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for books with info, and a more positive outlook. This book would be AMAZING for a couple that has current problems, but I just didn't find much of it applicable at this stage in our relationship. Granted, I am totally keeping it for whenever any problems arise. It really just wasn't what I was looking for, the book completes all the goals the author intended to, absolutely. It's a pretty awesome resource for the right couple."
5,Informative and clear,Much of what I had read about Asperger Syndrome had been full of people's personal stories. This book gives a more clear understanding of the common issues that all Asperger people share and then how they manifest. There are these core traits and many ways for them to manifest. In this book it was easier to gain clarity about this confusing syndrome.
4,Must read for anyone married to an Aspie or has an Aspie son,"Several years ago, my eldest son was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome. On the way out the door of the doctor's office my husband asked, ""Do you think that I have Asperger Syndrome and this is what is the problem in our marriage?"" I quickly answered, ""Yes!""This book has been a Godsend. It not only made me feel as if I wasn't crazy or entangled in a disfuctional marriage but it gave me insight into how I can help any woman who sees in my son what made me fall in love with his father.This book has allowed me to peer into my son's future and help prepare him to find and keep someone to share his life with. I also hope, someday, to pass this quick reading book on to my future daughter-in-law as an engagement gift.The best thing is that I no longer feel as if I am selfish for my belief that ""you won't get a gift you want unless you pick it out yourself."""
1,crap,It's crap. The author treats AS people like they're some kind of wild animal and acts like everyone should feel sorry for anyone who has to live with one.
2,Disappointing,I was hoping this book would a) provide a qualitative description of aspergers and b) lots of concise entries on scenarios that occur and how a partner should respond / cope with them.
2,Cheap,"I am disappointed. For the cost on this item, it is a complete rip off. The paint is a mess, the helmet is very cheaply made, and it runs incredibly small.Don't waste your money on this thing.I am adding pictures to show people what you won't see from the manufacturer."
3,Decent but not for the serious fan or collector,"Ordered from one of the merchants on here and was hoping for a decent quality product. It wasn't too bad but was more in line with one of the cheaper helmets available on Amazon:Stormtrooper Helmet. As others have mentioned the plastic isn't that great (has a rubbery feel to it, like typical injection-molded toys) and the visibility out of the eyes is poor. There is no padding inside but that is easily remedied by using foam or a shirt to help keep the helmet in place.This helmet would be great for wearing around for a few minutes or possibly to display (though the quality is nowhere near ""showroom"" good). For the price + shipping I was hoping for something much higher quality but ended up returning it and spending a little more to get a good helmet from a vendor in Hong Kong on eBay. If you're looking for something to wear to conventions that doesn't look cheap, I'd pass on this particular Rubie's helmet."
1,Its too small,"The helmet is too small, it looks as if your head shrunk, maybe for kids but definitely not for adults."
3,Helmet,"The helmet is great looking for the price, considering other helmets go in the $100s. however i bought this to actually wear for a costume which will be near impossible unless i somehow add padding to the inside since its just one gigantic hole for your head..very hard to keep steady and see out of it..so if u want a really good costume helmet u may want to spend a few more bucks for it to be wearable..its also very hard to breath in it...so it needs to be rigged up in order to be worn..fair warning! looks quite decent tho lol"
1,garbage,"It's not as advertised the paint is horrible and it,s not even correct size and the visibility is so bad you can't even walk around with it on. DON'T BUY!!!!!!!"
1,I returned this! Cheap,Cheap helment and not what we were expecting so it was returned. Great seller just bad product!
1,Cracked,"Three words, warped, cracked, junk! The Rubies products are terrible! Check out the eFX helmets! I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy but not an overly discerning authority on collectibles. That being said, I was overwhelming happy and satisfied with my eFX ""ANH"" Storm Trooper Helmet! It came with a certificate of authenticity and was very securely packaged. DONT BUY THE RUBIES...."
5,"Excellent, Most Excellent","The helmet is great and looks great, if you want to look like a storm trooper. It could use some padding, but the factory doesn't make it that way. Also, in the words of Luke Skywalker ""I can't see a thing in this helmet."" It raises several qualms about the quality of Empire design and use. I mean you build a huge space station, and you create a port for it to blow up? Anyhow, the design of the stormtrooper helmet has the eyes too high and too far apart, which does a lot to explain their legendary marksmanship skills. So either storm trooper and clone physiology is significantly deformed to match the helmet, or the Empire has buck-eyed designers for armor. But, great helmet :)"
3,so-so,"it's not as good as I would have hoped. With all of the sketches performed by Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler that they could have put into the collections, I found some of the discs lacking."
2,Not the one I wanted,"This wasn't the one I had 20 years ago for my kids, so I was dissapointed! It wasa different version of it and I didn't like this one. The quality wasn't that good either."
5,NIGHT OF BLOOD,"excellently written!!!! thankfully i had the 2nd and 3rd books to dive right into, i wouldve been tormented to wait"
5,"""Fun""tastic","Ezra Idlet and Keith Grimwood have got the number of kids from 6 to 12, during those great years before kids start listening to the wasteland of commercial radio.Once more, as on their previous CDs for kids, the fare is all about big helpings of fun. ""Your Name Backwards"" will probably set off a frenzy of wild pronunciations and word games, not a bad side effect (especially on family road trips).""My Best Day"" captures the magic of turning 10 without being sappy or silly. ""Junk Food Jump"" shows how versatile these guys can be---and it's right on a kid's vibe.Ezra and Keith have that special ability to charm kids and not bore adults to death. They don't preach or look down at their subject matter. And they can flat out play and sing. Plus, these are well-crafted recordings with great artwork.You could do far worse than adding some Trout Fishing in America CDs to your collection."
3,Good - But Not as Strong as I Remember,"Growing up in the UK, I remember Olbas Oil as being powerfully strong - so much so that I was afraid to get it on my skin when my mum was using it to alleviate the effects of the common cold I usually developed every year. I purchased this sampler kit recently to see if I could get my hands on something like what I remember. The oils and inhalers have the same smell, but I feel like they are weaker in strength than what I had in my childhood. Perhaps I am simply romanticizing what I recall, but I do think these scents could be stronger - my sinuses need it to be!If anyone can recommend a stronger Olbas product, I'm all ears!"
5,"Great album, pity about the description...","Okay, let's get the nonsense out of the way first: Is it likely that an album with the title ""Marvin & Farrar"" would be...""The one and only album from Bob Welch & Hank Marvin...""??? Bob Welch and Hank Marvin have never worked together anyway, that would be Bruce Welch - doesn't solve the title problem though does it?Also this is absolutely not the ""1st time on CD"". Anyway it's a great album from Hank Marvin & John Farrar which did not get the recognition it deserved at the time. Still sounds great today. Great songs, great harmonies, great guitar work. If you like CSN you'd love this album."
4,Not bad,"Although Hank Marvin and John Farrar are purported not to have thought much of this album, it is very listenable. It is not as good as the two earlier albums by Marvin, Welch & Farrar, however; either of which I would recommend above this.It is frustrating that Amazon does not know about the seminal British (mostly) instrumental ensemble (and Cliff Richard backing group)the Shadows but continues to confuse them with others and mislabel their genre of music."
1,warning !!!,they are not shipping the real action figure they are shipping cheap snap together model kits that you have to paint and can be bought for 5$ in a store
3,Seen it before,"On the whole, I found this book to be entertaining as long as I did not pay too much attention to it. This is a book to read on the subway (which I did), and not one to read when seeking thought-provoking ideas--unless you mean the ""Huh, where am I?"" kind. When I tried to puzzle out everything Baird presented, I found myself lost and without a dimension to stand in. The plot twists--perhaps ""mangles"" would be a better word--are fast and dizzying, leaving a reader marooned until another universe comes along to pick up the wreckage. If you like sentinent ships and dimensional travel, try Heinlein's ""Number of the Beast."" Though somewhat dated and soft porn-ish, it covers the same ground in a more entertaining way."
3,"Good Buddy, Cheesy video","Buddy gets four stars (while always amazing, he seems tired/uninspired), the video gets two, for an average of three. The King Street concert CD was hyped as super high-fidelity, but in fact was a poorly recorded disappointment, and the sound on this DVD is also muddy/thin. That said, it is an invaluable record of Buddy. (I haven't seen the West Side Story set DVD from the same concert--I assume it is of similarly mediocre production quality.) The band is not one of his best, but decent. The lighting is cheesy, too, but until someone unearths better footage, we'll have to do with this. I wish NBC (or Johnny Carson homself) would release a collection of Buddy's many appearances on the Tonight Show, or that somone would release his full set from Monterey, which seems to have been filmed."
3,Way Short of Greatness,"Weatherby got it right, this is a bit disappointing. Having survived (sort of) a fire and the ensuing floodwaters, I suppose the quality is amazing. Still, it's a let down. It seemed a perfunctory performance by most of the band and even Buddy appeared worn down though he was doing more than simply going through the motions. I'm glad to have the DVD, but even happier I did not have to pay for it."
4,Good Book,An excellent source for information on an important subject. Readers should also look at Raquel Martin's book The Estrogen Alternative.
3,"Excellent facts, Bitter Judgementalism.","If you can get past Ms. Sellman's vitriolic diatribe against the Pharmaceutical industry, and Male physicians, there is a wealth of information every woman should know. I could certainly do without her insipid social commentary. One of the worst parts is near the end of the book, under the heading of 'Creating Sacred Feminine Power', we are encouraged to ""Take time either by yourself or with friends to have a full moon meditation"". Isn't that sweet? What the hell does that mean? I hate crap like that. Because her research seems so thorough I trudged through that kind of psycho-babble garbage, to get to the very informative facts. This is another one of those, ""Women are Saints, Men are very very Bad"", books. Read it for the facts, and try to ignore her definite prejudices. I for one, adore men, and her advise on natural projesterone just makes me able to love them more."
5,Well done - a must read for every women!,"Dear Sherrill,I've read your wonderful book and I just want to say ""Thank you for your inspiration, guidance and advice"". I've also recommended it to so many women, who are in desperate need of a solution to their ""hormonal woes"". Well done - a must read for every women.Jill Kennedy Wonderful Women Networking - (via email)"
4,rustic ramblings,"If you like Miles Davis' Filles de Kilimanjaro and the second side of Brian Eno's Before and After Science, they pretty much collide in this recording by Brokeback. Perfect accompaniement for reading a book in the warm sun on a summer's afternoon.Languid, but crystalline."
4,What it is is what it is. Planes of sound carry you thru.,"I agree w/ the Mazon review. It's like the soundtrack to your last bad relationship: warm, dreamy and ultimately over."
2,Dreamteam of Thrill Jocks strike again,"Another fine effort by chiropratic T Jocks McEntire'd', Herndon and (insert names here). Prepare to succumb to the triple bass assault of Dougy, Joshua, and Noel. Melodic? No. Ambient? Hmmm. Thrill Jockey? You bet'cha! These are fine artists playing in the shallow end of the pool they have excavated. The entire Chicago crew needs to evolve their sound if they expect anyone to care. Spinal reallignment up your arse from the Brokebackstreet Boys! Wanna be on their next album just move to Wicker Park and stop bathin'. But on a serious note I recommend this album to all those who wish they too lived in Chicago and have attained intellectual superiority. Musicologists will study this album for years. The bes' thing since Shepards Pie, Mates!"
4,"1001 Quotes, Illustrations,and Humorous Stories for Preachers, Teachers, and writers",The book is what I thought it would be. I will be able to use it from time to time when I prepare sermons or speeches. It will be used.
4,a useful tool,"In preparing for the event of speaking to others, it is appropriate to people one's ideas with concrete illustrations. While our ideas may be our own, our communication is a shread event. A tool such as this book helps us get beyond ourselves into the mind of others. At least, we know when we pick an illustration that two people like it - me and the author."
1,Misleading Title,"The title promises quotes, illustrations, and humorous stories for preachers, teachers, and writers. What you're NOT told is that the contents are ONLY for those wanting strong religious material. I would not recommend this book for anyone except a conservative Christian minister. I'm a minister of a more liberal faith, and I am unable to use most of the material."
4,Beautiful book for first baby projects...,"I think this is a beautiful book. The photography is gorgeous and I love how the projects are sequential based on experience. For example, you start with a simple scarf (NOT ideal for babies! but good practice), a blanket and then move into pillows and sweaters. I'm working on my first wearable for my new son. The directions are clear for knitting the pieces, but those pertaining to seaming it together are VERY vague."
3,Suggested Yarn Colors are unclear.,"I'm new to knitting and new to pregnancy...I want to make the blanket in this book. I have searched high and low for the exact colors represented in this book. I simply wish Debbie Bliss would list the dye lots in the book so that her version of ""mauve"" matched up with mine or at least that the ""mauve"" in the book matched up with the yarns in the shops. Ugh."
4,Good basic baby knit patterns,"I agree with some reviewers that Debbie Bliss's instructions aren't the clearest. Get a good knitting instruction book for that, like ""I Can't Believe I'm Knitting."" But the patterns in this book are sweet, and easy to put together. I like the way they are organized in order of difficulty. I have done the boatneck sweater, and had no problems. A friend recently finished the raglan sweater in an evening and was delighted with the results."
3,"Nice Patterns, but only uses Debbie Bliss Yarns.","These patterns are so cute, but they make it really hard to substitute yarns from the listed Debbie Bliss yarns. And who can afford to use only her yarns all the time. Well, I'm sure someone can, but not me. And her yarns are hard to find around where I live."
1,Baby Knits for Beginners,every pattern I have tried to create from her books never works out to be as adorable as the photos. I am always tearing out and redoing as she does not explain clearly through her directions.
4,Good solid book,"I looked at a lot of books by Bliss before I settled on this one - it has some really nice projects. I wasn't necessarily a beginning knitter when I picked this up, so some of the projects weren't attractive for me. But I have done the boat-necked sweater, the cashmere booties, and the umbilical cord hat (several times, to the delight of friends). I'm about to start on the garter-stitch cardigan. It would be nice, though, to have diagrams showing how the pieces should turn out/be blocked. I've used different yarns with a lot of success - don't think you have to stick with her yarn. I'd recommend this book. The simplicity and elegance of the projects make them classics, and you could easily add your own touch to any of the items in the book."
1,terribly disappointing patterns,"I own a number of other Debbie Bliss books and I am an experienced knitter. I ordered this book because so many of the reviews contained here are so wonderful...BOY.. was I disappointed in this book...1 pair of cute socks and the other patterns seem to be for someone who has never knit a garment before...So dont be disappointed, experienced knitters and pick a difference Debbie Bliss book....Sadly...."
2,Horrible Pattern Instructions,"While the pictures of sweet toddlers in classic colors and designs is tempting. Don't bother with this book - or other Debbie Bliss books. I am currently making the Eylet Dress and had to make an appointment with my yarn store's Knitting Doctor. Even she couldn't make sense out of the instructions on the neck shaping. So with her help, I am now 'winging it'. This woman also told me that I was the 2nd person she helped just this morning with a Debbie Bliss pattern. And another employee also told me that she has trouble with DB patters as well. Trouble is there are no diagrams as to what size the pieces are supposed to come out. After spending $35 on yarn and $20 for a book of designer patterns, I don't expect to be 'winging it'. Needless to say, I will never buy a Debbie Bliss book again."
2,"Congratulations, almost","Well, these are not recycled designs, and the needles are larger than normal for her. But this is not a book for beginners. There are problems with clarity of instruction. And again, she's over promoting her own brand of yarn which is expensive and short on yardage."
1,Skimpy Directions,"I'm at least an intermediate knitter who purchased this book because of the classic ""Ralph Lauren"" designs. I knitted the ""jacket with seed stitch bands"" using the Bliss Cashmerino yarn. The directions don't give inches to measure pattern pieces nor do they provide graphics. After seaming the shoulders and knitting the neck, I realized the front pieces were too short, thus making the neck large enough for me. I've spent the morning taking it out and will be able to adjust the pattern I hope, but I'm not happy. This is a expensive sweater for a baby, and I expect a Bliss pattern to provide me with accurate, complete information. From now on I'll avoid books that don't provide measurements and graphics."
3,"beautiful designs, not so clear instruction","I love the designs and suggested colors of all the projects by Debbie Bliss. However, her instructions are not very clear for a beginner book, and I found myself consulting more advanced knitters many times for clarification. The book would be greatly improved with more pictures or diagrams of projects broken down; in other words, what each piece should look like before their sewn together. Also, there are a couple projects that involved supplies that were not listed. I found out mid-project that I needed stitch holders (first I had to find out what stitch holders were!). I had never knitted before trying the projects from this book, and would not recommend it to a first-timer like myself who is learning the basic skills. However, I love her designs and her projects are so beautiful."
2,"Love her yarn, hate her patterns","I absolutely love Debbie Bliss' yarns. I would love to dive into a vat of cashmerino and go for a swim.The first thing that bugged me about Baby Knits is that the cover shows a baby in a scarf. Only someone with a death wish for their infant would tie a scarf around their baby's neck.The second thing that bugged me about Baby Knits is that every pattern knits up too dang big. I knitted the boatneck baby sweater with Debbie Bliss yarn (yes, I checked the gauge) and it was HUGE. I went on to knit the little cap, faithfully checking the gauge. When I was finished, the cap fit ME. When I complained to other knitters, they nodded sagely and said, ""Bliss' patterns always run large.""So, beware. This book contains cute-cute-cute baby patterns sized for adults"
4,"Not as pictured, but of good quality","I did not get the heavy-duty style stretcher bars shown. The ones I received were much, much thinner. This was fine for me and the price was great, but if you're in need of the heavy duty bars be forewarned."
3,Small alignment problem,"There is a slight alignment issue where the bars lock together. Some corners are flush, some are mis-aligned by about 1mm. I had to use a sand paper to smooth it out. If you don't have sand paper, a knife will work too, because pine wood is pretty soft.Other than that, the bars are decently sturdy. They are about 1/8 inch thicker than the ones I bought from a local Micheals store (which don't have alignment problem).It's important to put glue into where the bars lock together to prevent shifts. For larger sizes, I also put a few staples into the corners to improve structural rigidity.The size is standard. For example, 24x36 size will fit into a 24x36 frame with some slack, and after stretching a canvas on it, the whole thing will fit snugly into the frame. It protrudes about 1/4 inch to the back of the frame, so you'll need 1/4 inch offset clips to secure it."
3,The thing about my folks,"A funny, yet hart tugging movie that would be good for the whole family. The movie is very well cast with Peter Falk, Paul Reiser and Olympia Dukakis. I am very pleased that I have added this movie to my collection. I give this mopvie 3 & 1/2 stars."
3,Best thing - Peter Falk,"The best thing about this movie is, of course, Peter Falk, but listening to him argue over and over with his son, always saying the same things, got a bit tedious, and the fart joke wasn't funny after the first time. I was disappointed not to see more of Olympia Dukakis.Still, an interesting take on relationships, and how we never really know our parents. Worth a look."
3,Just all right,"This just feels like one long couch session. I don't know whether Rieser is exocising some family demons or what but there is nothing new or ground breaking here. You should have done this, you should have done that. Children always have the luxury of being sideline coaches after the fact, don't they? Peter Falk give a great performance to a mediocre script and I rather have had a V-8."
4,THE ORIGINAL NATURAL BORN KILLERS,"I know that sounds a little extreme, but the Honeymoon Killers is actually based on real events. The violence is almost non-existent compared to Stone's slaughter-fest, but the psychology of this film is disturbing. The Honeymoon Killers was handled with brilliance and for those who are not familiar and are fans of true crime, well, this is highly suggested. The extras are the real treat, and for those who are interested, discover them for yourself. Criterion does it again. Kudos."
5,Awesome Camp Classic,"I love this movie, Shirley Stoler should have had a huge career as a character actress, because she IS the movie. Tony Lo Bianco in his first film is hot, buff and goes the full monty in gritty docustyle film based on true events."
5,A Shirley Stoler Cult Classic on Criterion!,"This movie is just fantastic and has gained a big cult following over the years. Filmed in black and white, it only add's to this classic film! Shirley Stoler and Tony LaBianco put on unbelievably wonderful performances - also, Doris Roberts from 'Everyone Loves Raymond' fame has a nice appearance in the film! Of course, with Criterion, you can't go wrong- packed with bonus goodies! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !"
4,Holger Czukay - 'La Luna' (Tone Casualties),"'La Luna' is simply one of those CD's that after the second spin, you simply love it or hate it. I, personally thought the single title cut here 'La Luna' (47:17) shows us just how brilliant of a musician this former Can bassist / founder is. A wonderfully composed ambient-electronic journey into the world of German pioneer music is to be thoroughly soaked in here. Later on 'La Luna', I noticed that Holger's often collaborator U-She shows up adding some of her Avant Garde vocals. Don't say this about most discs, but it's quite possible that 'La Luna' is maybe almost too brilliant for most. A definite should-have."
1,hard to use,"I have made only one attempt to use this plett pan, but it was very disappointing. No matter how well-greased the pan was, it was nearly impossible to turn the pancakes when they had cooked on one side. The pancakes stuck to the pan and burned as a result of my being unable to turn them in a timely fashion. I do not know if it is the texture of the pan, but as there were no instructions with it and it was, obviously, cheaply made in China, I would not recommend this version to anyone."
1,"Horrible, I was disappointed!!","After watching the movie which I enjoyed. I bought the book thinking it would be just as good if not better. Boy was I wrong, the book was horrible. I could barely finish reading it. This is one case where the movie is much better than the book."
3,"Not bad, but ""Introducing... Ruben Gonzalez"" is much better","This is a re-release of recordings made in 1975, a fact indicated on the notes inside but nowhere on the outside of the disk. The performance is fine, overall, but pales in comparison to the spectacular recording from 1997. The pieces are all a lot shorter -- the longest is a little under 4 min. -- and thus there is less of the freewheeling, playful jazziness of ""Introducing... Ruben Gonzalez."" It is a pleasant, nice disk, though. I just hope he can make it into the studio once more..."
3,Disappointment,"Having listened to Introduction....Ruben Gonzalez, I was pleased to see the new CD by Ruben and immediately bought it.I have found this a disapointment as I don't think it matches the liveliness and quality of the Introducing.. Ruben Gonzalez.If you were to buy a CD by Ruben Gonzalez then I would defintitely only buy Introducing.... Ruben Gonzalez as the tracks on Indestructible lack imagination or flair in my opinion."
4,Lots of fun!,"While it is a little dated (published in 1979), this book is great fun. It is full of dry, zany British humor and lots of plot twists. I look forward to reading Bonfiglioli's other works. Summary from the cover:""This caper finds Charlie the recent bridegroom of a voluptuous millionairess who is involved in a plot to assassinate the Queen of England; at the none-too-tender mercies of a Chinese dentist (the inscrutable Lo Fang Hi); and in terrified possession of the costliest baby powder in the world--among other mishaps."""
3,Juicy couture,"The Juicy Couture parfum that We bought was very good. The price in comparaison to other dealers was pretty good, and we received the product as we were promissed. all in all went well."
5,juicy parfum,I love it.... My teenage daughter and I are sharing the cologne and I actually have to hid it so she doesn't use it all. It stays on all day and people always ask what I am wearing.
4,Juicy Couture frequent buyer,"I received this bottle & an identical one from a Dept store. I found the Dept store fragrance seemed stronger & stayed with me much longer. For the price it's a good buy. Also, 2 days after buying it the price dropped. It has now dropped 3 times since my purchase in January. I find that frustating. The fragrance is one of the best out there."
1,"fake, watered down, smells like pee","Save your money. I bought this item thinking it was a good deal and I was running short on my other bottle. When I got it the color was more of a orange pinkish compared to my REAL juicy couture which is a yellowish. It sprayed fine and the bottle was EXACTLY the same except the tassle was kinda weird. The top stopper broke off. It does not smell the same at all, its watered down or something. I feel like im spraying pee all over me cause it has a funny smell like that. DONT BUY!"
4,NICE,"i smelled this in a clothing store. and loved it. this was exactly what was in the store. for me, i cant put on alot. it totally messes with my sinuses. but a little dab-a-do-ya..and the dry down is really nice.."
3,Light Softer Perfume=),"I use to like this perfume, it does not stay on as long as I would like. It is more softer than I expected. It seemed like when someone bought me a tester of Juicy from the department store the scent was stronger. I don't know. I have stronger perfumes like Sean Paul Madame, Blueberry Britt,and Alien. So this just did not do for me. I know mix this with some other perfume someone gave me called Precious or Lovely, mixed together it smells great. I probably won't get this perfume again. I like some kick to my perfumes, not overbearing but something..."
3,came without a spray nozzle,"I gave this to my wife for Christmas and when she took of the cellophane, opened the box, and took the cap off there was no spray nozzle. I was very disappointed. I can't return the perfume because it's a ""hazardous/flammable"" material. Now I'm off to contact the manufacturer to see if they can send me a nozzle. What a pain."
1,FAKE!,I buy stuff on Amazon all the time and this is by far the worst thing i have ever purchased. Its FAKE! It smells awful it's not even the same color as the real Juicy Couture spray. Next time i will spend the money and buy the real stuff.
1,NOT AUTHENTIC,I realized this fragrance did not last like the first bottle I purchased (which was from a dept store). Then I realized it smelled slightly different too. I purchased a bottle from Macy's and compared them side by side. Sure enough this one was different. A knock off for sure.
3,"Does not smell like fruit, has a stronger scent","I ordered this perfume only because my fifteen old daughter said it was popular with teens and also had a good scent, but I did not care for it I thought it was too strong!"
3,too bedroom,"I like it when after a day or so on my clothes, but right after spraying - maybe good for a bar and smoking restaurant (must be my body chemistry :)). It changes a lot during just few hours and unpredictable in that sense."
2,No-ture No-ture,"I do judge a perfume by its packaging. I went to a local retail store desperately in need of some odor other than mine, with internal parameters that the product could not be produced by adult celebrities or teen celebrities, and that the packaging did not look like it was geared toward teens, teen celebrities, or adults posing as teen celebrities. This one seemed to fit my liking, without busting my husband's wallet (I purchased a mini). Other stuff, see below:Good stuff:-It is a parfum, which is the longest lasting of the liquids in the perfume world.-Bottles are exquisite.-Price effective if you do not use it as Jean Nate (no accent key) Splash.Bad stuff:-Top note reminds me of Christian Dior's ""Poison"". '88, anyone? (I know it was introduced in '85, but it hit teen culture in my neck of the woods in '88.)-Other notes are totally girly-girl floral in general; I cannot pinpoint notes. Watch out!-Headache producer."
5,I love the Parfum,Hi I love it now if I could get it without it being broken. This is the second one. Thanks
2,bla,i got it cause i kept hearing wonderful reviews. i smell nothing but alcohol when i smell this. not for me i guess.
2,Very Flowery,"My wife didn't like it. It is very flowery and she is more of a sweet or musk scent type. If you want to smell like flowers , try it out. Ps, this stuff is not strong. She does 3-4 sprays and I cant smell it on her an hour later. Wish I bought her more Amarige De Givenchy. Thats my fav on her."
3,dont pay for expedited shipping,"I bought 2 of these $3 samples for stocking stuffers. I chose expedited shipping because i thought it MIGHT be 8 bucks for 2 little samples...well i got charged $16 for expedited shipping and couldnt change it... so save your money, and dont pay for shipping unless its standard."
4,A fragrance for all ages,I am very picky about the fragrances I wear but a few days ago I met a friend who was very this very perfume. I was instantly attracted to its unique smell ...I must say that I like Viva La Juicy better than this one since it is more fruity/flowery. Juicy Couture is not bad either..I have worn it in the evening as well as in the day time and gotten compliments all the time. I would not call it a mild fragrance so be careful when you splash it on. It lingers on the clothes even after a long day. Look for deals on Perfumania.com. I got a 3.4oz bottle for $50 with free ground shipping when I bought it from Perfumania's website in October.
5,Heavenly scent for confident woman,"I am on my 3rd bottle and not planning to give it up any time soon. Usually I get pretty bored with the same scent and never even finish a bottles. This one is a different story. It has something in it that I can't get enough and every time I wear it, I get compliments. It makes me feel sexy and confident. Magic in the bottle, enough said."
5,amazing...,"best smell, best price..never ever miss it great gift for any girl...a MUST BUY PRODUCT...i bought it for my sister and she went crazy over this"
2,Do not order fragrance online!,"If you want this enough, spend the extra $20 on Juicy Couture's actual website. The one I got was a fake. However, Amazon was helpful and refunded my money. Be aware that you cannot return fragrances because of the flammable liquids."
5,Love this Scent,This came in record time. Very satisfied all around. Exactly what I wanted. Packaged for travel I would order this again
5,the best,my girlfriends are the best. i was hinting over and over about how much i love the scent of this perfume. and now i received as a present for my birthday. its the sexiest scent ever. something sparkly like champagne with some floral notes and vanilla. i so love this scent.
5,Juicy Couture Perfume - Great service!,"I order the Juicy by Juicy Couture eau de parfum spray 3.4 oz. It arrived quickly, new in packaging, exactly as described. Would definitely do business again!"
1,horrible!!!! NOT WHAT I ORDERED!,"I ordered the perfume in the picture which I already had previously so I know of this product and i got a different juicy perfume, what sucks is I ordered it to the states and i told them not to open the box but I live in Israel so when I got it I was very upset :-("
2,Too 'loud' and flowery,"I agree with another reviewer in that I like this scent much better after the ""dry down"" period. The 'notes' that are left after about 30 min. are kind of nice, but I wouldn't purchase again. This is too overwhelming and too ""flowery"" for me personally. Though I wasn't allergic to it like most scents, it did give me a slight headache. If you like perfumes that people will definitely know you're right around the corner, then this one might be for you. Because this one is definitely ""loud"" and you can most certainly ""hear"" it announcing itself! If you want a more light & subtle scent that's very similar, try ""Pretty"" by Elizabeth Arden."
5,Awesome,I love this particular perfume. Also the scent lasts long after applying it. Am constantly getting complements. Great for those who don't like strong manly perfumes.
2,Where's the charm?,When my 15 year old daughter opened the cellaphane wrapped box she found that her 3.4 oz bottle did not have ribbon and charm wrapped around throat of bottle. She did not want JC just for the charm but apparently the younger girls collect JC charms and sometime wear them. I called vendor customer service to ask about this but customer service stated that they did not sell re-packaged items. No problem with the scent. It is authentic product. I was disappointed because it was my 15 year old's first bottle of eau de parfum so she will most likely remember missing out on her charm. Anyone have an extra charm out there?
1,gives me headaches,"Every time I put this swcent on (and i've given it more than a fair number of tries!) it gives me nauseating headache, and I can feel it on me all day in the most disturbing way.MAybe it's just me, it does not smell nasty, it smells interesting, but I just can't handle it.. one of those you HAVE to try on first."
1,Smells like an old woman,"I do not like this perfume at all. To me, it smells like something an old woman would wear. Doesn't surprise me since there are none of the typical ""young"" notes in here at all (especially vanilla). Or if there are, I sure as heck can't smell them! All the friends I've asked have agreed with me that this is an old woman-smelling perfume. I sold mine on ebay."
1,Juicy Couture Over Its' Shelflife,"Like most of you, I love Juicy & gave myself a bottle for Christmas to carry me thru the New Year. The new ""parfume"" arrived quickly & when it was unwrapped the metal logo fell off the front of the bottle(that should have put up the antenna); I had just purchased some fingernail glue & that worked perfectly for remounting the logo.....so-o-o-o nieve....I opened to sniff & it smelled like Juicy (yah, I was wearing my own Juicy); and, after the real Juicy ran out....the one ordered from Amazon didn't smell like Juicy anymore; and, time had tolled on returning it.Bottom line, my Christmas Present Juicy is either old stock or pseudo-Juicy!P.S. I have purchased over 40-items on Amazon & this is my first negative feedback; however, it is not my first disapppointment.....I do not punish a Seller with negative feedback simply because I didn't like a product I purchased!"
3,Smells horrible at first.....wait like 30 minutes...,"I was going to buy this fragrance at Lord and Taylor but then decided for Vera Wang Princess. Instead, I took a sample home. When I first put it on, I was sooo upset. I got a headache from the strong, cheap air-freshener like smell. I was so apalled that I was going to write a horrible review. But after a few minutes (about 30) it began to smell soooooooooooooooooooooo great! It's very girly, sexy and unique. I love it. I'm most likely going to go out and buy it now.I recommend you spray on like 30 minutes before you go out."
5,OK,I loved this scent. I also loved that the vial was spray on! It was the perfect little deal for my holiday ideas!
3,Likable characters.,"Back Cover description: She thought she'd finished with romance. After the breakup of her engagement, Prudence eagerly accepted Dr. Benedict van Vinke's offer of a job in Holland. It seemed the perfect opportunity to begin an entirely new life.What she wasn't prepared for was the effect Benedict and his young daughter, Sibella, would have on her emotions.When was she going to stop acting like a fool, she asked herself angrily, and remember she was just his employee?Slightly different, Prudence is lovely, not plain; tall, not short and has a family. This is less a cinderella story and more about equals. Benedict is the one who seems unsure in this story. Worth the time-I almost didn't read it, I like the ones where the heroine is plain."
5,A different look from war.,This is a different look at the war in the Pacific as told by one Japanese soldier who was trying to survive.
5,A CD you'll never get tired of...,"This CD is wonderful. She really does sound like Natalie Merchant (and looks kind of like Elle Macpherson). Her style is very acoustic, and the songs have a pop-folk sound. They grow on you after the very first listen. This is one of those CD's that you'll end up putting in over and over again without getting tired of it. I didn't know what to expect, but I truly enjoy this one."
5,Alma en Libertad,Great Album! La cancion esta muy padre! All the songs are really nice. It is a soft rock album with lots of guitar. Her voice has different ranges which makes each song unique and moody. It is very hard to find an album with many good songs. Somewhat like Shakira with a clearer voice.
3,forget you not,"great c/d, but still needs some guiding.Not too sure of the style,voice is very soothing,but needs refining."
3,Fair,This gospel dvd wsn't as funny as the clips I saw on you tube maybe it's a different dvd. and I ordered the wrong one.
5,GET YO LAUGH ON,"GET YO LAUGH ON IS A FUNNY, CLEAN, STAND UP ME AND THE KIDS CAN WATCH AND LAUGH OUT,,,,"
4,More Experimental.,"This is a combination of their earlier sound with Tape Head-like guitar noise. A lot of the songs start off quiet and contemplative, but somewhere in nearly every song, Tabor's guitar comes thundereing in. Whereas in the past few albums Pinnick has generally dominated (a good thing), Tabor's influence is more pronounced on this one (also a good thing). He takes a few more solos and shares in the songwriting duties as well as producing the album. Pinnick's vocals are also somewhat subdued. Both Pinnick and Tabor have de-tuned their intruments even lower than usual, giving a darker edge to the sound. The spoken-word break over jazzy instrumentation in ""Fishbowl Man"" is a pleasant surprise. This album is not nearly as groove-oriented as Tape Head and it does take a few listens because the songs have a lot of musical subtleties to it, but after a few listens, the album really shines."
4,this one really grew on me,"When ""Bulbous"" was first released, I wasn't into it at all. But as some time has passed, it's really grown on me. The mix kind of sucks, way too bass-heavy in a bad way, which does detract from the music. The bass has to be turned down to even listen to the album, really. But there are some real standout tracks on this one, incl. ""Julia"", ""Charlie Sheen"", ""Marsh Mellow Fields"". An album that differs a bit from what some people expect from the band, but IMO it doesn't really deviate from the King's X ""sound"" as much as some fans seem to think."
2,a disapointment,"king's x have never let me down before of after the release of Please Come Home. while the album does include some fine specimens (fish bowl man, when you're scared, marshmellow fields)there is still a surprising amount of dross (julia, smudge, charlie sheen). a disapointment, only worth it for hardcore fans."
2,Should have listened to the other 2-star reviews...,"I love King's X, the first 3 albums plus Tapehead and Ear Candy are indispensable, but I don't think I can ever get into this release. Not sure if I should bother with Manic Moonlight now - sorry guys..."
3,Epitome of average,"Well, KX were not quite firing on all cylinders here, but about half of this cd is quite good. The rest is forgettable."
3,"Above average songs, below average recording","King's X has put yet another solid album out. After just one or two listens, you ask the question, that I keep on asking myself, ""why isn't this band more popular""? Sure, all of us King's X fans know the truth .... ""this band is one of the BEST bands out there"", but this fact should be common knowledge among other music listeners. With that said, I'll drop the bad news on you ..... this is a horrible recording. There is WAY TOO MUCH low end, and not enough high end on the majority of the cd; hurting songs like ""Charlie Sheen"" .... which is still an awesome song. I also feel that this album is a bit weaker than the previous 2 releases by the band. Make note that the album does contain 2 instant classic King's X songs, ""Marsh Mellow Field"", and ""Move Me"". There is MUCH more positives here than negatives, so one shouldn't really hesitate in picking this cd up ..... your ears will thank you for it!"
3,Only buy it if you are a King's X fanatic,"This is the last acceptable album from King's X. The boys still have a little gas left in the tank, but when you have released as much great music as these guys have in only a ten year span it can be tough to release something original. The other problem is that they have set the bar so high with the first seven albums. PCHMB sounds like a watered down version of one of their great albums, but still better than most of the nonsense that passes for rock and roll music on the radio."
2,Not so great.,"Not their best effort. I would say maybe 1/4 of the album is worth hearing. The opening track sounds like something Andy Warhol would have done while he was on dope. Not sure if this was their reaction to changing record companies, but if you skip this record, you aren't missing anything."
4,dark & brooding,"In the space of an album (and indeed, in the space of many of the songs thereon) one is led thru soundscapes ranging from the sublime to the brutal. Many of the songs have in some way a threatening feel to them, with odd-sounding, disconcerting chord changes. Their best work since Dogman."
2,Please Come Home...and make a new record,"Like everyone else who's reviewed it, I'm a die-hard, bought Gretchen when it was new, saw them first on the FHL tour, underrated band, great players, singers, yah yah. This record falls far below their previous work. It's less a bunch of songs and more a bunch of song fragments jammed together in the hope that they'll work. They don't.The mix is close to unlistenable because of the overachieving low end (maybe from proximity to a better, but also almost unlistenable record with the same problem - Let It Go by Galactic Cowboys). Perhaps they were trying to compensate for a lack of woof on the first 3-4 records.I salute their talent and their courage, their continued shining presence in a world of musical junk, their artistic and personal searching. I'm with you, Ty, Doug and Jerry - just not on this one."
3,Controversial Album,"King's X was an acquired taste for me. Now, for the last 10 years I have been truly hooked. See them live; you won't regret it. They are amazing. Great band.This album is a mystery to me. I've tried spinning it over and over for two weeks in my car. I just can't get close to it. I'm starting to like Smudge, Bitter Sweet, and Move Me. The others...either embarrassing lyrics or chord progressions that just aren't natural or comfortable to listen to.If you want King's X at their best, get Tape Head (a masterpiece) or Black Like Sunday. Then get the Best Of. When you get really hooked, which you will, buy this album last. Maybe you'll get into it more than I have been able to.Rock on!"
2,what the hell is this?,"I wasn't sure if I was alone on my thoughts on this album till I read some of the other reviews. I love King's X and have every album. Great musicians, but this album is a NO GO(sorry guys). It gets a 2nd star only because after all, it is King's X. Go out and get Kretchen or Dogman just don't even bother with this one. Seeing how most King's X fans are either musicians or real music contesueurs, I highly recommend you check out Stevie Salas Color Code(of course after you get your King's X CD's). You will not be dissapointed!!"
5,King's X is cool,"This album is one of the most interesting to come out from King's X - mostly because it's a departure from the technical side of the band. They have fled the massive scales, complex harmonics, and polyrhythmic drum beats for a more earthy approach to songwriting. I must say that I really miss Doug Pinnick's screaming vocals the most. He is the hatchet that smashes your sonic sensitivity with the deftness of a vial of mercury - his yelling is groovy, and you can't touch it. Also, I miss the Ty Tabor shreds on guitar. I personally think that the technical aspect of King's X is what GAVE them the earthy sound; by leaving it, King's X sounds more formulaic. GOLDILOX rules!"
1,"Unfortunately, you can't go any lower","I can be called a fair-weathered friend for all I care. This was the end of King's X as far as I'm concerned. This was more stripped down than ""Ear Candy"", and it's showing without a doubt that they've started to shed Christianity. There was only one good song on here, and that's the 2 part ""Move Me"". The rest is nothing but junk, and should never have seen the light of day. It breaks my heart because I use to really enjoy listening to them from the first day I purchased ""Out Of The Silent Plant"", and ""Gretchen Goes To Nebraska"" at a Strawberries store in PA. I wasn't thrilled with ""Manic Moonlight"", or ""Black Like Sunday"" either. I feel that they lost thier touch when they left the Lord. I can certainly understand that it's not an easy life to lead, but when they were in tune with the Lord some of the most pretty music flowed from thier albums. With this, and the other most recent 2 they lost thier identity."
4,Good work gentlemen! but the moonlight shines brighter.,"Great CD for many reasons, though I just bought their new one, Manic Moonlight, which is better....probably their best ever; Moonlight is better than Gretchen or FHL or Dogman. Moonlight is better because it has: super heavy riffs (Soundgarden?), strange vocal and guitar effects, beautiful vocal harmonies (Gretchen, etc.), tight drumming along with tribal grooves, seasoned vocals, and an amazing mix overall.Listen to the samples. You will be pleasantly surprised."
1,By far the beginning of a slump,"I will say that it's with this album I stopped listening to King's X. I cemented it even further when I read the review of ""Manic Moonlight"", and it mentions that Doug Pinnick and bandmates no longer follow Christ. I haven't been following Him too much lately either, and I do miss listening to King's X. I feel that this was a weak album still. I miss the heavy funk sound that was on ""Tape Head"". This was a weak pop album at best, and I was lost the minute I heard ""Fish Bowl Man"" I feel the best was saved for last with the 2 part ""Move Me"". The rest was pathetic. I may give this album another chance, but not now. As for them not following Christ I'm sure they have thier reasons, and it's not for me to judge them. I was disappointed, but I have to get over it. I heard samples of ""Ogre Tones"", and it sounded rather good, so I will give King's X a second chance, as for me following Christ I will come back to Him someday."
1,too long,"the shipping speed took the whole estimated time, nearly came late. condition was worse than advertised."
3,a reader from California,"The English translation of this book can be improved, as the Chinese version is much better."
3,ho hum,I got this because I thought I'd do the cover witch. But now I don't like it. So I'm giving it away.
3,Didn't Tell Me anything I didn't already know,"For all the talking in this book, when you're trying to break into any business, there's no substitute for self-promotion. And as I learned, painfully, that includes cold-calling art directors to make sure they received your carefully designed mailer, and to keep mailing. Gets expensive, but that's just how it is."
3,"Bought it, didn't really need it!","I purchased this book for an online class I am taking for my Master degree. I started reading the book and it gave me a very bad light on the program of study that I have chosen, and after the class began I found out that I didn't need the book! I have read most of it now, and after the first chapter the book mellows out and it has helped with my evaluation of other projects for this class."
3,Enjoying Life in Japan-a Traditional Export,"Actually, a guy called Ogata makes living by illegally producing pornographic flicks, trying to look respectfully as his personal life is an extent-or a very play ground- for his job itself: he is for step-daughter, a school-girl playing around and with him for a monetary gain, his superstitions-overvhelmed wife is in an incestuous relation with son of her from a first marriage and brother and sister are cool each to other somehow either, while colleagues do not shy from same gender relation entertainment.A black and white movie where characters speak mostly than act explicitly."
2,a very young work,"This is a film that shows the potential of Shohei Imamura, but im afraid it does not fulfill it. The film trys to hard to be arty:the jump cuts and ""creative"" camera movement serve only to confuse and alienate the viewer.Imamura is a master film maker, and this isnt a horrible film, but if you want to see his best, get ""the Eel"" or ""warm water under a red bridge"""
5,The Pornographers,"Imamura's sharp Oedipal satire was risqu√© and far ahead of its time in 1966, tackling themes of incest and sexual perversion in a contemporary Japanese family. Ever fascinated with the lower quarters of society and the human body, Imamura delights in registering the bizarre ways in which affection can be placed and misplaced, or simply twisted in knots, as with Haru and her too-affectionate son, Koichi. Mr. Ogata, meanwhile, looks at his blue movies as a kind of public service, and one could say the same for the director, who uses dark humor in his stylish depiction of such lurid but fondly human subject matter. Made with consummate skill by a Japanese master, The Pornographers is a seductive look at the kinks of love and longing. Still, decidedly not for all tastes."
3,NO SKIN FLICK,"Love'em or hate 'em, idiosyncratic films that dabble with subversive notions and stories of fringe people make some viewers uncomfortable. You either get it or not. For those who do, there are rewards.Shohei Imamura's THE PORNOGRAPHERS (Home Vision Entertainment) is about ""public service"" amateur porn filmmaker Subu. He supports and sleeps with landlady Haru, who thinks her disapproving dead husband has returned as a carp. But really, Sabu lusts after Haru's daughter. Voyeurism and incest is kinky comic fodder for Imamura, who said he's interested in ""lower human society and the lower parts of the human body."" Not for every taste, but way ahead of it's time. If you liked this one, see if you can find ""Down and Dirty."""
5,A dictionary of the north of Mexico,"The Lexic√≥n del Noreste continues the lifelong project of Elizondo, of collecting the oral/poetic/visual tradition of the north of Mexico, the Noreste. It includes his two novels 70 veces 7 and Narcedalia Piedrotas, two books of photographs Polvo de aquellos lodos and Presa de una lente objetiva and now a dictionary, the lexicon. The dictionary took over thirty years to compile and features words from Chihuahua, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n."
5,Deep Still Christmas,Deep Still Christmas has a wonderful selection of songs; not all Christmas songs. I have had this album for several years and bought this one as a Christmas gift for a friend.
3,Don't buy if you have the other Deep Still cd's,"I purchased Deep Still 2 and loved it, so I bought Deep Still Christmas. I was dissapointed to discover that most of the songs on here were already on either Deep Still or Deep Still 2. A few songs are actually Christmas songs, but most of them are not skillful or notable in any way. The only song I was really pleased with was ""What Child Is This""/""Greensleeves"". It's the ONLY one with good arrangement, performance, and instrumentational variety that isn't on the other cd's."
3,Spooks Are Definitely On Some Other Stuff,"Spooks are not bad at all-if you like futuristic acid hip hop. Their music reminds me of Digable Planets or yes, Fugees. When I first heard ""Sweet Revenge"" on the radio, (""Tried to use me, apparently don't know who I be."") I knew I had to purchase this cd. Ming Xia brings a mixture of Jazz, R&B, & Soul to the group. I really think by 2002, Ming Xia will have an album of her own. I am without a doubt feeling her soulistic style. Spooks as an overall group bring a new age/futuristic feel to hip hop. The cd is good, if you can appreciate a different style.Soul Searching 4 Life,SoulCatcher"
3,three tracks are real good the rest is o.k.,"I heard Spooks the first time with the the title ""Sweet Revenge"" on the Disappearing Acts soundtrack, and I thought: ""Dang! This girl has a Jill Scott groove!"" Beautiful voice, deep lyrics and all, and since I love Jill Scott to pieces I went and got the Spooks CD. Well, I found the CD O.K. but not that great. I wish Ming-Xia would get on her own. I think she would do a lot better, because the male members of Spooks rapping (sounding like Common or The Roots) seem to really cramp her style. Don't get me wrong, I like Roots-Style rap, but in this case it's not doing the girl any justice."
5,Break From the Norm,"If you're tired of the minstrel show that hip-hop has become, this is the CD for you. I was pleased to hear artist who weren't talking about the size of their rims, their platinum and ice, or how high they get. Everyone in the group is original and creative. Ming Xia is an amazing singer, and she sounds good in any language (listen to Swindley's Maracas). The production values are through the roof with a lot of really good beats. The skits are comical representations of the music industry.Karma Hotel, Swindley's Maracas, and Things I've seen are my favorite songs.This album should have sold more than it did, but the artists force the listener to think. It's not just some mindless BS like ""Chicken Noodle Soup"" or ""Walk it Out"". The Spooks have lyrical content and coherent thoughts. I guess people just weren't ready for that from a rap group. Their target audience probably stopped listening to rap because of all the lame acts that dominate the genre."
1,Ming Xia NEEDS to go solo,"It's a shame to have to have Ming Xia (the group's female singer) mixed amongst such feeble mc's. The mc's are so bad I'm almost embarassed for them. Ming Xia's voice is incredible however, and she really deserves an album of her own as this does her a total disservice."
3,"Fine picture, okay movie, no frills.","""Dick Tracy's Dilemma"" is a pretty standard 1940s potboiler. Starring Ralphy Byrd as Tracy, the famed detective faces ""The Claw"" is this entry of the series. The movie is nothing special, but it's a fast paced, reasonably entertaining time-waster.The no-frills DVD has sharp, not very scratchy picture. There are only four chapter links."
1,Terrible kindle edition,"This is a good book, but the Kindle edition is ruined with sloppy proofreading. Much of the punctuation is missing, which makes for a distracting read."
3,"Ok, but not great","Had to read this for an English course. Incidentally, I live in the same town the book is set in. The town or the people in it are not as presented, at least it isn't right now.Great character development, but that's about all there is. Cared a lot for the chareacters, but nothing really happens to them until the end."
5,OMG!,"This DVD/CD was the best celine dion concert dvd/cd anyone could of ever bought as a celine dion fan,this item was just simple awesome."
5,"You Rocks, Celine!","I can't wait for its release! Celine you are the greatest! I watched her concert here in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and I can't get enough of her as I keep on looking for new material from her to collect as collectible. Hope SONY would do something BIG for her in the upcoming. I'll be at the Vegas soon! Celine you are superb! Unbeatable!"
1,Celine Dion DVD,"I have not received this DVD. If possible please resend or refund the money I have paid for the DVD. I purchased 4 Items all at the same time I received the 3 (Santana, Beegees Chicago/Earthwind And fire)"
3,Awesome Concert If You Were Seated Away From The Stage,"The concert was awesome, as far as the music. Seating was terrible for those who paid outrageous prices for front row seats. Most of the concert footage was shot from one location, meaning those seated in the three other sides of the stage could only enjoy the concert by looking up at the big screen. The stage was about seven feet tall and when Celine was on the other side of the stage you could not see her. Nor could you see the backup singers or most of the musicians. Whoever came up with this ""seating in the round"" arraingement did a huge disservice to those sitting near the stage who paid up to $750 for a front row seat. I saw Celine in a New Day in Las Vegas over twenty times and the shows there were enjoyable and worth the money. The DVD of the Taking Chances Tour was 10X better than the actual concert in person."
2,The Audio is sub-bar,"It is hard to hear the song clearly because of all the noises from the background and the echo. On my 1080i screen, the video is stretched slightly at both sides suggesting that this was not shot in native wide screen format."
1,Fooled Again,"I wanted the ""Taking Chances World Tour,"" video but somehow ordered ""Through the Eyes of the World,"" which I later learned from reading another review was not what I wanted. It seems that could have been made clear before I ordered it, and not information I learned from another person's review after the fact.I then ordered the ""Taking Chances World Tour,"" but instead received ""Celine: All the Way, a Decade of Song and Video."" The wrong upc code was placed over the existing one, mislabeling the DVD+CD as the ""Taking Chances Tour."""
1,Blu-Ray,What about Blu-Ray of the concert?Shame on Sony for not releasing the concert on Blu-ray as Well.
4,The Power of Love,"I bought this CD/DVD for one reason, and one reason only - her rendition of ""The Power of Love"". If you listen to one song by Celine Dion in your life, please let it be that one. It is the most beautiful and powerful delivery of any song I've ever heard. The fact that she delivered it in a live performance is beyond words. On most of the other songs, her improvisation (which is normally the reason I love live performances) just rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. Especially ""Shadow of Love"" where she adds ""mamacita"" to the song. ""Taking Chances"" is the only other performance that I really liked, but being able to have my own copy of ""The Power of Love"" live from Boston made this purchase completely worth it."
4,"Readaptation of Lacanian Theory to the Social ""Symptoms""","The long-lasting controversy over ""form"" and ""content"" passes down from Plato. Then, it emerged in the French academics. Writings on Psychoanalys is a text, attempting to fusing the two diverse viewpoints into a wholeness. Initiating from the Freudian and Lacanian, Althusser justifies that the methodology of psychoanalysis is scientific. It's the same of Roland Barthes's The Structuralist Activity in which he takes off the verbal attack from the social Marxists, such as Satre. In the second stance, he appropriates and readapts Lacanian theory to the socail ""symptoms"" as a psychoanalyst to an analysand. On the one hand, he regulates and justifies for Lacan that psychoanalysis is aculturalistic and not scientific. On the other, it strengthens and expands the scope of Lacanian theory from an individual to an whole society even thouth there are some unjustificabilities within Althusser's appropriation."
1,Bootleg CD!,Attention Tuck and Patti fans! This is a bootleg cd.It was poorly recorded in 1988-neither the artists or songwriters recieve royalties!Visit Tuck and Patti's web site for confirmation.They will make a live recording one day-this is not it!
4,An irreverant look at classical music recordings,"The author draws on three decades in recording and broadcasting to tell the story of his and other classical record labels. This amusing and informative memoir covers recording and editing techniques, how they are made and marketed - every facet of this fascinating industry.'Very well written...impressive musical background, knowledge and experience...wonderfully sly humor in writing of the insanities of this business and the ever-unpredictable human condition' - Joseph Simon, Pangloss Press"
1,don't buy this,"this is the worst cd anyone can buy.. why would this group remake songs that have hardly left the charts.. songs not even a year old yet. i'd buy every cd single of the songs on here by the original artist before i buy this.. sorry for the rant but, it makes no sense to buy this when i can go out and buy the original artist who sings the songs better.. what a waste"
5,Excelente Artista,"Artista Natural, muy buena, una de mis canciones favoritas es Pensando en ti, es super chevere. Sinceramente la Recomiendo"
2,Don't waste your money...,"Even the new ""improved sound"" is unable to rescue this turkey.There is a lot to be said for Knappertsbusch's Bruckner but those interested in either the Schalk edition or Knapp. should go for the VPO Decca recording which is far better recorded and, more importantly, far better played. This must have been an ""off"" day for both conductor and orchestra, and the sound is awful.The good news is that the others in this series of Knappertsbusch Bruckner, ( in particular the 8th and 9th with the BPO in the Titania Palast ), are generally excellent performances with reasonably acceptable sound for the period."
1,Surprisingly Poor Review Book,"I've always been a fan of Princeton Review test prep books, but this one has insufficient depth of review. The material review section is essentially the same as an on-level high school Civics textbook. What really seals the deal, though, is that the AP Government and Politics exam has a very different format of free response questions from the AP European and U.S. History tests, and this book's sample free response help section explains how to formulate a thesis statement, etc., none of which will be of any help on the real AP Government and Politics exam. The sample free response questions are very different from the real thing. Anyone who relies on this book for test-taking strategies will be, at best, extremely confused when he or she is taking the real AP test."
4,"Cracking the AP U.S. Government and Politics Exam, 2006-2007 Edition (College Test Prep)",We found this very helpful in reviewing for the AP exam. Did very well on the test.Would recommend.
5,The Gods at play,"I'm writing this simply to put another 5 star rating up there for this absolutely essential set. This (and the Jack Johnson Sessions) is the Gods at play. The original album was brilliant - this complete set is transcendent. The joys to be found herein are many and others have listed and described them already on this site- no need for me to repeat them. Suffice to say that if you have ears and they're open, this is food for them. You can actually hear things beginning here (Weather Report et al). A set to lose yourself in."
3,Lots of good info -- looks like it was written for the money,"The one thing this book does that is really cool is tell you about how the dirty tricks in the credit business works. It's really interesting.The information is good, but generic. It certainly is nice to know that there is more to credit than credit counseling or ""new credit file"" spam in my inbox.But, I read it and I didn't feel like it made me that much closer to getting those nasty little marks fall off my record."
4,Pretty good,"As the author of Hidden Credit Repair Secrets, I found this book to be very informative to the average consumer. The author gets straight to the point on how to repair your credit. He gave good examples on how to complete certain tasks, what various laws meant and how to deal with the credit bureaus when they don't respond to your dispute request. I recommend this book."
4,"Big hits, lots of misses","This album is a tough one to sum up, but here goes: a few of the tracks here (specifically ""Corruptable"" and ""Georgie Don't You Know"") are power pop at its finest, reflecting the head-nodding finger-snapping anthems of the 60s through a fuzz filter. Unfortunately, the band seems to have attention-deficit disorder and wanders all over the board from song to song. As a result, many of the tracks here are lackluster. Nevertheless, I feel the good outweighs the bad -- just be prepared to skip past some tunes that come off as uninspired filler."
4,Contemporary language course,"This multimeida course (book, videos, CDs, and exercise book) offers an interesting introduction to French that will appeal to older children and adults. The course is entirely modern and deals with contemporary situations, largely urban in nature. The text is full of photographs (all in color) that include scenes from the accompanying video tapes. The focus is on a trio of 20-somethings and their daily lives at their work places. It's an interesting course with interesting exercises that are relevant to modern life. A weakness is that the presentation of points of grammar often leaves the student with a lot of questions that require a teacher to answer. This isn't a self-study course except maybe for someone who is highly motivated. For a class of teenagers and older students it is very good."
5,Bob at his best,"If you ever wondered how it all started with Bob Wills,all you need to do is get this CD. Take Me Back To Tulsa (Columbia) is another CD that is a fine companion to Stay A Little Longer.Go back in time in fine fashion and listen to how it all began."
5,SOUL GROUP CLASSIC,"ALL TIME CLASSIC BEST OF CD , EVERY TRACK I LIKE ALOT , THEY WERE ANOTHER SUPER SOUL GROUP FOR THE 70'S SEEK THIS OUT ......TIMELESS"
5,Superb R&B music!,"Although they didn't have the charts' 'recognition' and they are quite unknown outside US, they still remain one of the most soulful groups ever! I am a true fan of their music and I higly recommend this CD, as it includes all their hits in a really low price!"
4,Chi-Lites,"Great Old Skool flava, contains the fantastic Are You My Woman (Let me Know) which provided the basis of Crazy in Love for young Beyonce.A good CD for sitting down witrh the Mrs.Buy it and get the funk back into your life!"
4,Chicago Lite,"They may not as been as popular as other similar groups of the day but the group that started out as Marshall & the Chi-lites found their niche in pop history. When you first heard the heartfelt wailings of ""Oh Girl"" or ""Have You Seen Her"" or the Rare Earth sounding ""(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People"" we were hooked. We didn't know much about the politics of such songs back then when they were released, we just knew what we liked. We liked the Chi-lites. And still do."
2,I found this too stupid to read!,"I admit that I didn't read very far into this book - it seemed too stupid to read! The premise of a Chili cook-off was ridiculous, to me. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what happened."
2,Wrangler partly rugged jeans,"I found these jeans to be (at first) to be the ultimate pant for someone that works on their knees all day. I am in the flooring business and for years used-up pants really fast. I tried the upland pants and found the nylon part of the pants to hold up very well, however the denim part is the same old thin material that wears and tears so easily with the regular wrangler pants. The top corners of the back pockets started to show wear after only 6 wash cycles and after 15 cycles the crotch ripped beyond my comfort level for the rest of the day on the job."
5,Finally music worth listening to!,"Finally music worth listening to! Radio D.J.'s should stop playing the same old crap (payola-hyped music) and give young, new talented groups a chance. We should all demand better and different music so as not to be stereotyped as salsa or merengue or tejano only. There are great groups out there like Los Bacilos playing real latin music and struggling to get an opportunity. Keep up the good music!"
1,good for a laugh,"If you love Steely Dan, do not buy this CD. There is none of the wit and none of the amazing riffs. All the wrong horns (what's with the Kenny G style sax?) What a shame about this!"
3,The Lost Art of the Instrumental,"There have been some rather harsh comments about this album being ""mall music"" (probably from, ironically, mall rats). What we have here is a collection of jazz interpretations of of songs that have become very familiar in our lives. Not the tedious, annoying presence of Phil Collins, but rather, brilliantly crafted tunes that hold together whether performed by the Dan or by others.In the case of ""No Static"" the tunes are at once recognizable, and at the same time fresh performances by skilled musicians. However, this collection never reaches. The tunes are performed well within a very conservative comfort level. One wishes the artists had taken some risks with some of the material.As it is, this is a great choice for sitting back and having a couple margaritas while the sun sets. Prior to the arrival of CorporateMusic, there were always intstrumental tunes like this on air somewhere. Whatever became of them?"
1,I would not be caught DEAD,"With this CD in my hands after giving it a listen today...most folks are right...call it Mall Music, Muzak, whatever...but did the musicians ever hear a Steely Dan record? All the things that they worked so hard to do (edgy, angular phrasing, perfection in mixing) has been forgotten here...no self respecting Steely Dan fan should own this...if you want to listen for a laugh, go to you local used shop...you are sure to find this...that's where mine will be by tomorrow...and I don't care if I get anything for it..."
2,Muzak of Steely Dan,"somehow this became a Camp Fire John Tesh Project Meets Kenny G.but the feeling,vibe&Attitude&Cool Fusion that Steely Dan brings in there Music is nowhere to be found here.this is the kind of Music you need all of the Mr.Cofee&extra Sugar to feel anything here overall.there are some cats here I respect as Instrumentalist but they didn't do the ""Genius"" of Steely Dan any Justice for me."
4,Great Smooth Jazz,"Being a Steely Dan fan and a smooth jazz fan, this album is pretty good. On it are many well known jazz artists like Dave Koz, Richard Elliot, Warren Hill and others. It brings a new sound to the already great classics. If you are a jazz fan this is a must album for you."
2,"A ""not very good done"" great idea","So the concept is good, take a group of top notch jazz musicians and re-interpret (or as they say in the movies: re-imagine) the best songs by the legendary Steely Dan.The problem is that there is no re-imagination. It's just playing the songs like in a hotel lobby bar.It sounds like a walk in the park from these players, but without any tribute of sorts. What a waste on a great idea! Specially annoying is ""Hey Nineteen"".If you want to hear a great example of an inspiring cover of the Dans, listen to (one time almost member of Steely Dan) Larry Carlton play Josie from his Standing on Solid Ground album. Now there's an example of how its done (just listen to the Kirk Whalum sax on this track).Anyway, I would recommend this album to Danatics just to complement your collection.Or pop it into your ipod and hear it at the dentist's while waiting for you appointment."
1,I Rather Hear Static,"This album was obviously put out by a bunch of jealous studio musicians who were never asked to participate on Donald and Walter's albums. With all the great output from Steely Dan lately, I can't think of any reason to buy this."
1,later stuff is better,"This is great as a fun gimmick to party and get wasted to if you are a kiddie, but it isnt exactly ' music 'per se though. Their later stuff is better, cuz they were rich and could afford to pay real musicians to write and play songs for them to sing."
1,Lies and then more lies,"The product did not work with Parkervision routers, and evidently does not with others as well. The response from OTO software is that they would come up with a solution in a ""timely"" manner. Three months later an email to them resulted in the reply that they were not going to be doing anything like that at all. A waste of money and time."
4,A very good scientific guide,"As epidemiology and public health professor finally I found an excelent guide for planning and conducted research in the field of human sexuality. From the theory ( Chapter 2) to quantitative data analysis (Chapters 12 and 13), the Handbook of M. Wiederman and B.Whitley Jr. give the basic elements for a scientific research.Only a few critics words from an epidemiological perspective, I'm not agreed with the skeptical wiew about observational (non experimental) studies. The theoretical and empirical developement of epidemiology is a valid investigation way in human sexuality. Case-control,cohort studies, confounding bias control and interaction analisys are tools for a non interventional research, that avoid problems of internal validity, the serious troubles and artificiality of experimental approach."
4,Accuracy questionable,"I recently tried this unit out for the first time on a run that I thought was very close to 3.1 miles. The unit measured it at 3.4. This is 10% off, which is a real problem if it's really off that much. I'll have to take it to my local high school track and run a few quarters to see if it's consistently off."
4,A nice training tool,"A convient product once I got used to how it works and what it does. I am still finding new features it has. It does loose its connection fairly easily when near tall buildings or uder tress for a few minutes. I lost about two and half miles of a half marathon because of the buildings in the San Francisco. That was diappointing! My usual runs are in open areas, so for training puposes it is a nice tool."
4,It takes a licking and keeps on ticking,"I have owned this unit for about 9 months. While on a run I had to make a pit stop. I had the unit clipped to my waistband and sadly the unit fell in the toilet. Yes, it did. I went in after it (I HAD TO!) and even after the after taking the plunge & coating it in antibacterial gel the unit has never stopped working.I realized I would like to have a better clip for my waistband:)I find the mileage to be accurate when compared to the milage markers on the trails. I would recommend this unit highly for the price."
4,Very Functional and Cost Effective,"I purchased this system about one month ago and have used it on about six runs over four miles in length. It is generally accurate and certainly for the MPH. I do wish there were three lines of readout to display speed, distance, and chrono, but I can deal with just two of each at one time. The documentation this system comes with has a few gaps in initial startup and in options use, but with a bit of playing, you can figure it out.I am extremely happy with this device."
1,Not Recommended,"This product has deficiencies regarding the durability of the bracelet, power of the gps antenna, and durable appliance provided the adional holding the gps to the athlete's body. As stopwatch for training is excellent but as gps is very limited. After 6 months of use the problem began to clamp the body gps (fatigue) and two years after the strap broke."
1,"Crappy, unfortunately","You would think The Exploited, a popular and famous band, would have some really cool songs on their ""Best of"" album, right? Well, they do have about 3 or 4 good songs. The rest are godawful. What a shame. Their good songs are ""Computers don't blunder"" and ""Dead Cities."" ""Attack"" is ok. ""Dead Cities"" is by far their best song. Probably the best they ever did. Try to get those songs from a friend. Don't buy this album."
3,not all that great,"first of let me say this is not an oi! band. they were influenced by streetpunk music, but it would be wrong to call them that. oi! was a kind of streetpunk with songs about nationalism, unity, woringclass protest, beer, etc. the exploited stood behind their belief in anarchy which eliminates them from being called an oi! band. the exploited did put out some decent material but lets face it, they are not all that great. their lyrics lack intellect, and most of the music itself is boring hardcore. if you are looking for classic punk with no real message, talent, look no further. this is theee band that the bands on punkcore want to be. stupidity"
4,Verdi fan,I found this Trovatore to be one of the most exiting and beautifully sung. A great marriage of music and drama. Unfortunately there are some irritateting backround noises. Because of this I bought another copy and the same background noise is there. That's why I gave this 4 stars. What a shame.
1,The worst Il Trovatore ever,"This Il Trovatore is not Verdi. Alagna maybe fit for some of it, but Ms. Gheorgffhiu is not. Her trills are non-exisistent, her high notes are not there, her sense of the drama is never in evidence, and her pitch problems are by now a part of identifying any of her sets or single cds.The d'Amor sull'al' Rosee is the litmus test here and many sopranos are not quite up to its considerable demands, as say Aprile Millo is..she is, parenthetically, brilliant in role on cd..in any case Ms. Gheorghiu skirts all trills, ducks all high notes at the close, and tags on something Verdi never wrote. Horrible.But hear her Manon, Tosca, La Traviata, La Rondine, amd what can this new Butterfly be like? Dreadful things.How does she record in the studio? It's awful."
4,Decent shirt,Good quality shirt. Somewhat overpriced. I sell tees for a living so I have a good idea what it cost to print this shirt and the seller made a killing.
4,Indestructable,"We had purchased a couple of these 2 years ago, and they're still OK... just faded. The price was too good to pass up, so our dog got new ones for Christmas -- and we gave some away as presents to other dog owners!"
1,Destroyed in 15 minutes,My dog is obsessed with fetching tennis balls so I wanted to teach her how to catch a frisbee. I figured something softer for her mouth would be good and based on other reviews this seemed durable. Unfortunately it took my 1 yr old cocker spaniel all of 15 minutes (no exageration)to chew through the edge where the rubber tubing is and shred this thing apart.
5,great,This floppy disc is the best frisbee we've ever had! It's easy to throw and easy for our dog to catch. We love it!
5,super dog toy,"This is a great product. I have one from 10 or 12 years ago and is bleached out from the sun and rain while laying around in the yard. Still works great. Just enough lettering left to know what name to look for and have ordered several new ones. My dog loves them and can not distroy one in week, a month or even years. Most other toys are gone in a few weeks. The stitching around the edge is the only occasional failure point but it is due to my Border Collie using it as a tug toy and chew toy as well as a fly and catch toy. I think it is probably the best toy I have found for my very active 50 lb dog."
1,Kindle version of this book is missing most of chapter 12,"Beware: kindle does not care enough about content to verify that the digital version of this book is complete. It is missing most of ch 12, where the novel's climax is reached. So you miss the resolution. Many scanning errors too, which make parts of it like deciphering code. Shame on amazon for profiting on this incompetence, and having no place to get recourse."
1,Missing a chapter,I really was looking forward to this book but after seeing another negative review I checked the table of contents and went to chapter 12. There is only 1 page! Not worth the effort to read that far and be frustrated. Now I have to return it. Should have believed the reviews.
5,Great representation of Albanian epic legacy,"This book would be much more fun to read in Albanian, or if translated directly from Albanian. As in most of his other works Kadare manages to perfectly incorporate Albanian history/culture/values in the plot. Kadare does an indespensable service to Albanian culture, by providing the reader with an account of Albanian legends and ways of life. The main point of this book is to remind the readers that Albanian/Illyrian and Ancient Greek culture, mythology are much closer than assumed. And that they were in a complex (give and take) relationship. Kadare says all this in a beautiful way!"
1,The File on H,This was one poorly written book. I struggled through over half but couldn't continue. I was never sure what the author was attempting to say. Was it an attempt to show a backward country and its concern with foreigners or was it about two Irishmen searching for a current folklore of an ancient Greek writter? I gave up.
4,Eye Openner.,The Swiss Guard? The Vatican? The Pope's Soldiers? How does all this fit together? I'm still not sure. But how interesting even for a non-catholic.I thought it was well done and informative. The Pope has meetings with most of the head world leaders.
3,"A lot of good information, just not for my application.","This book has a lot of information regarding these systems, but what I was hoping it contained was information about Automotive applications, which it does not. A lot of the basic principles can be applied to automotive systems, but I was looking for something more specific. I guess I'll have to purchase the Automotive Air Conditioning Systems book for ...So, all in all, I can't give it a bad review, it just wasn't for me."
2,Cryptic and useless,This book is more or less irrelevant to the task of servicing air conditioners. There's a lot of useless theory and the rest is confusing and not to the point.
4,good for a layman like me,"Not being a professional, this book helped me understand some basic principles and to know when to call a repairman and to get good service in the event I do need help."
3,Good Basic Info,This paper back is a good basic handbook for the apprentice providing fundamental descriptions of AC and refrigeration parts/components and process definitions.
5,this book is great to have when your on a job sight.,this book is great to have when your on the job sight it contains everything you need to know. even if you haven't ever work on refrigeration systems before . with this book you can!
1,BAD ART PROGRAM!,LET IT BE KNOWN TO EVERYONE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS THE WORST PROGRAM I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! THE PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK IN ANYWAY AND I SPENT ONE HOUR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK IT! THE PROGRAM IS NOT A USER-FRIENDLY ONE AND DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO EXPRESS YOURSELF! THIS PROGRAM IS A SHEER WASTE OF MONEY!
3,Not the Least Scary!,"If you're looking for a standard Tartan Asia Extreme horrorfest then look elsewhere. My wife and I both yawned through the entire film, then put on the original version of Pulse to try and get our horror fix for the evening. Although the lead actors are capable and watchable there just isn't anything really gripping about this film. Just about any other title from Tartan Asia is more satisfying and delivers actual frights."
2,Wasted Potential,"The idea of a horror movie taking place in an isolated DJ booth sounds like it should be a good, scary time. Ghosts calling in on the DJ and exposing truths best left hidden. The feeling of being trapped in a room where everyone can hear you starting to lose your mind. The unrecognizable sounds coming through over the phone.But the Booth spends very little time creating what could be a horror classic. Instead we have an unlikable DJ-lead character who becomes more unlikable as the film goes on. We have little hints as to this DJ's past indiscressions through various phone calls and coincidences. (While this could have been a cool story device, it is ruined by the use of too many flashbacks to retell the story. A main part of the story is the DJ's life as a pre-teen.)The movie has a strong opening of a DJ 40 years before getting a call about an unfulfilled suicide pact. But the film is dull from that point on and never picks up"
3,Bloodwars!,"It took me a while to get used to Lumley's style again. It seems jerky, unnatural: with many short clauses strung together. At times, this represents the quick paced thoughts of the characters, but sometimes it just feels misplaced.Once again, the denouement comes in the last 10 or so pages, which is very much Lumley's style. Personally, I like to see more closure. Sure, the world was put to rights; the swamps are drying up, but is that really the end of the wamphyri? I would love to think so, for the sake of the szgany, but that would certainly put an end to the story possibilities!"
2,Not what I remembered from the original series,"I read the original books when Harry Keogh was the protagonist. I have to say that I was dissappointed in this one. It didn't have the same pull as the others. There was something about the writing that just gets annoying after awhile, can't put my finger on any one thing though. I guess it almost seems comic book like in a way. Maybe it could be that I went too long between books and forgot his style of writing.When I don't anticipate getting to read more and don't think about what will happen next during the day, that's usually a sign that the book needs to go."
1,Tedious and badly paced,"I did my best to finish this book, but I found it tedious and unenjoyable. The plot is thin and it develops too slowly. The action scenes are poorly paced, completely unexciting to read. Most of the verbiage focuses on long exposition about the thoughts of the book's many (way too many) main characters.The story viewpoint shifts from character to character, but not in a logical, episodic way, like in the Lord of the Rings switching from Frodo to Aragorn when each is at a stopping point. Instead it's stream of consciousness: 1) a good guy thinks about a bad guy 2) we see what the bad guy is thinking about for while, then the bad guy thinks about his henchman, 3) then we see the henchman and he thinks about his girlfriend ... etc for 800 pages.Next time: less telling and thinking, more showing and doing."
1,Overpriced Timex,"Probably the most shocking aspect about this watch other than price is the fact that it's nothing more than a cheezy quarts movement. Not only will you have to replace the battery on this watch just like some cheap Timex, but it's not even good at telling the time with only that blazing silver dot on the 12 o'clock position. For the price of this Movado, I can purchase a 25 Jewel Automatic Swiss Chronograph and never have to worry about replacing any kind of battery again."
4,Smooth to the ears Ya'll,"These guys got mad riddim. The lyrics are so smooth and so well written, but most of the songs are remakes of older ones. who cares, they sound better like a reggae love song remix. highly recomended for the music enthuisist. i cant spell."
2,"Nothing special, but not too bad","I probably went into this movie with my expectations set too high. James Ryan plays the villain and that is why I was so excited to see it. In case people don't know, he was the star of 'Kill or Be Killed' and 'Kill and Kill Again', 2 of the very best American martial arts movies ever made. He plays the villain in Kickboxer 5, and does a fine job, but he is not in nearly as good of shape as he was 15 years prior to when this movie was made. He has not aged very well. Marc Dacascos is the star of the movie and he does a good acting job, but my main problem is that the fights are nothing special. Some good kicking, but that is really all that I enjoyed. The story is not even worth going over. It is pointless. Don't waste your time with watching this movie, even if you are a Marc Dacascos fan. He has a few good moments, and that is the only reason the movie is worth watching.2.5/5"
1,KICKBOXER 5 THE REDEPTION,"VERY DISSAPPOINTING,HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KICKBOXING SAGA,A PRODUCTION THE COULD OF DONE WITHOUT,DAVID SLOAN DIES.........LOL.COMMON REALLY EVEN I COULDNT BELIEVE IT,SEE THE MOVIE FOR A GOOD LAUGH,NOTHING ELSE."
3,"Yes, indeed average...","...was this movie of Mark Dacascos, one of my favorite Martial Arts-actors of all time. That was one of his rookie movies in that he played a character who wants to avenge "" his firned's"" death (as usual in these kinds of movies) Of course this plot was immediately predictable and showed some bad acting. If Mark wouldn't have played in this movie I'd give this video 2 stars right away. But luckily it's not as halfwitted as it seems. I actually enjoyed Reeves and Croft teaming up together.Overall I'd say Mark has done better movies like Only the Strong and Drive."
3,Not as bad as you might think,"I've watched this movie 3 times now and it's not as bad as many others or that you might think it would be. Actually I'm a James Ryan fan and watched it for his apperance. Mark Dacascos is your standard new generation martial artists (think Van Damme, Gary Daniels, Phillip Rhee etc.). The story line is formula - bad guy kills good guy, friend of good guy seeks revenge in a final showdown. What lifts is slightly above the average for me is James Ryan playing the bad guy. Overall, I'd give it a C+."
4,very helpful,This book had a lot of good ideas which my staff tried to implement last season. Worth reading.
1,"Well, it certainly is ""offensive""...",Reading a book by Brian Billick on designing an offense is like asking Ray Lewis what it's like to have a clean conscience. Is that Tony Banks on the cover? Are you f'n kidding me?
5,Mr. Davis: where is your book?,"Obviously, Mr. Davis wouldn't recognize real knowledge if it bit him on his large rump, so disregard his review.A tremendous book, buy it, you'll be very pleased. Mr. Davis, go back to the land of steers and queers, idiot."
4,The Departed,"When first watching this film, I was blown away with the plot and acting. Then the 2nd and 3rd movie followed up the next year and expectation wasn't disappointed. It's like a Hong Kong ""The Godfather"" trilogy with cops. I hope the American remake does not disappoint its viewers much like that garbage film ""Gangs of New York"" staring Leonardo DiCraprio. Great trilogy, great DVD, great deal. Plus you can't find this boxset anywhere. I looked."
1,TERRIBLE SOFTWARE ZERO SUPPORT FROM PHANTOM COMPANY,"Never worked. Tried with 3 different OS's; 2k, XP Pro, and XP Pro 64 BIT and 2 different burners; SONY & Plextor, with the same terrible results. All this horrible application is good for is filling your hard drive with huge garbled files or DVD coasters (the couple times it actually attempted to burn the garbled files). NO SUPPORT! NONE! NADA! ZIPPO! PHANTOM COMPANY! Worst application I have ever purchased, without exception. STAY AWAY FROM EVERYTHING INTERVIDEO AT ALL COSTS! NOTHING BUT ENDLESS FRUSTRATION AND BLUE SCREENS!"
1,Stay away from Intervideo,"I purchased a copy of DVD Copy 4 and a couple of weeks later they released version 5. I filled out their online support form to get a free upgrade since it's in their 90 day window for free upgrades and they never responded. Sent them an Email a few days later and still no response. I just called them at 5:45pm PST and it says their office is closed and their hours are 9:00am to 6:00pm PST. This company is a joke, stay away!"
3,Useless for editing!,"The program copies OK, but try to compile a DVD with individual items from various DVDs (its ""merge"" function). There is no facility for creating your own menu and buttons. It creates this automatically, BUT THE CAPTIONS ARE ILLEGIBLE!!!"
5,LOVE This Stuff,"I wear my hair flat iron straight and very curly. When I have my hair curly, this stuff is awesome!! It adds life and shine to my hair and calms down the fly aways - Makes me look salon Fresh : ) However, when I straighten my hair I don't like to use this particular product because it seems to weight my already thick straight hair down-- I have to confess though, a lady at my job used it on her straight very dry hair and it looked so nice and shiny and youthful and she got many compliments from coworkers. A little goes a long way -Hope that helps.."
1,grease city,"this stuff makes my hair SO greasy (and still not shiny!) that my husband thought that i decided not to wash my hair after working out-- after i had just spent an hour drying, ironing, and ""shining"" my hair!! i won't use it again. it looks as though i have not washed my hair in over 2 weeks!!"
4,reader,I was very excited to find this book since it has been out of print for many years. It didn't turn out to be what I expected but it is still helpful in witing a life story.
3,BLAST PAD,"STOMP ROCKET LOOKS FUN AND DURABLE BUT TOO BIG AND REQUIRES TOO MUCH PRESSURE FOR MY, ALMOST 3 YR. OLD SON"
2,MORE LIKE PEACH,"The only complaint I have is, it's not really pink, it's more peach. I wanted a pink eyeshadow to prepare for the summer, guess i still gotta keep looking."
3,It's cheap - but....,"If your child loves Dora, they will love this. Kids are more interested in the character than the quality of the item (a fact that manufacturers really abuse.) This is a very narrow float. Even little kids have a hard time staying on it. It's not very stable and after only a handfull of uses (and gentle uses at that) it already had a hole in and was useless. I don't think it's a good buy."
4,Fun game,"Great game, it was a little short but it was a lot of fun! If you like shooter games this is a must!"
3,"Like a ""popcorn"" movie","This game isn't going to change the world or anything. It is fun. Plain and simple. It is like a summer blockbuster movie. It has its flaws, but it keeps you entertained. And for a low price (if you can find one for), it is worth it. I would not spend $60 on this game. $20 or lower is reasonable."
2,Good concept poor excecution,Could have been good but it crashes too often. Also too many places where the game takes over the characters movement. Too many places where you should be able to go but can't. Too many silly characters who take too many shots before they fall. Fine if they had amour but right in the head? Too many times your feet are glued and you have to dodge bullets. Too many places where the cut scene can not be bypassed. As I type my PlayStation is frozen solid because of this game. Yes I have the update. There are other problems but I can not remember them right now.
1,why do i bother,"bought this game on the back of being a big John Woo/Chow Yun Fat fan. It seemed really good at first, although the graphics on the cut scenes are a bit lazy in terms of details. Diving around and using precision bullets is fun for a while but it soon gets tedious. The whole gameplay becomes shooting infinite amounts of rather dull AI baddies who just appear from nowhere after you walk over a partucular point. The bad guys don't move much, they just stand and shoot and there are far too many of them. This is OK if you are watching a John Woo film but is rather boring if you have to kill armies of drones just to progress to the next stage where you encounter the same again.I tried the online part but cound not find any game rooms after trying several times over a few days so I can't say if the online gameplay is any better.3 stars are for the initial impression but general gameplay is disappointing."
3,Ok more not!,"i sell it from Germany.I think the game is great, it is great but too much action and bullets - are the them how find in a asia Eastern.And the way's in the Gamer ever and ever the same.Make's fun and the Gametime is ok buy it an have fun."
4,Like a Jackie Chan Movie,"I find this game enjoyable. its similar to a Jackie Chan Movie. you get to jump off walls, slide over tables and destroy everything around you. This is a simple game, get from point A to Point B. other people say this game is tedious but this game was to short to find it boring. I'll say the game is about 5-6 hours to complete"
3,The greatest of the mediocore.,"It's strange, because I can't think of anything truly bad about this game. It's just...good. The only great thing about it is when you activate Tequila's various special moves and destroy absolutely everything in your path. Other than that? Moving around feels too loose and flimsy and there really should have been more to physical combat because there are times when it feels better to get up close and clock someone. And that feels empty and boring when you actually do it.But again, there's nothing bad about this, and it's far from the worst game ever. It just feels extremely dated."
3,Good Game But..........,The Game play is cool can be severely irritatingThe Sound is Horrible Sounds like the gameplay sound is cracking like your TV Speakers are bustedI Recommend this game as a rentalnot to buy and keep because every time you play you will hear that cracking sound.This my 4th stranglehold game to see if it's just the game shol enough it is the game.Just rent don't buy unless you like the sound of your speakers busted.
2,A definite drink coaster!,"Dumb story. Terrible gameplay. Awful controls. Good graphics. Tries way too hard to rip off the Dead to Rights series. John Woo needs to stick to what he does best... hard boiled action flicks. Leave video games to the professionals. Stranglehold would have made a better movie. I would not touch this game again with a ten foot pole. Everytime I see this game for such a cheap price in stores I want to reach for it, but turn and walk away because I remember how bad it is. What a shame a next-gen game turned out to be such a waste. I remember seeing screen shots for it a long time ago and thought it looked game. Surprise! It looks better on paper, and plays just as good too."
4,Very Helpful Book,"I love this book. I bought it for a class, and not only is it very helpful...but the information is very informative and I will use this long after my class is over."
5,two family house,"This was simply the most appealing movie we've seen in years. It was touching, funny, moving and romantic. Unlike most romantic comedies it entertains men and women equally.The music alone makes it worthwhile. A must see for anyone from 18-80!"
4,2 Family House.,"A married Italian man falls in love with an Irish woman whose husband left because she gave birth to a black baby! All of this occurs in 1950's Staten Island.You'll recognize many of the cast members from the Sopranos, but this is no mafia story.Michael Rispoli is excellent in his search for happiness amid a variety of social issues faced. Marital, familial, ethnic and racial relations are all explored, and the result is a warm, funny and entertaining movie."
5,Heartwarming!,"This movie was a Staten Island story filmed in Staten Island, the characters could have been the people we who live here all knew when growing up, they were like our parents and their friends. An unlikely love develops between a married man and a woman who gives birth to an African American baby, in that era of course frowned upon. I love this movie....I love people who follow their hearts and dreams despite what others may think."
3,iT WAS A GIFT,IT WAS A GIFT AND IT HASTEN BE RETURN SO I GUESS ITS ALL GOOD SO NOW I AM JUST TYPING WORDS TO MAKE THE 20 NEEDED
4,Not bad at all...,"The Thunderbirds are one of my favorites going back to the early eighties. This DVD is not bad from a video aspect, especially on a progressive scan dvd player with component video out into a widescreen hdtv. The audio is 5.1 dolby - but limited in scope. You have to have some high current power and a ton of dsp's to bring out the music. Buttt, considering it was a small stage venue in 1985 it's not bad at all..."
2,"Charlie is over the hill, and past their prime","Good try, but Charlie cannot catch the magic of the previous six album with ""Here comes trouble"""
5,"Brilliant, Brilliant man","Though some are quick to wince and scurry from the depth and gravity of this fascinating work, those with true intellectual capacity will regard it as classic. Jeff Wheelwright writes with a type of fluidity and beauty that is rarely seen in science writing today. He should be praised and rewarded for Degrees.The continuous quality of Wheelwright's writing is astounding."
2,Degees of Disaster,"Degrees of disaster contains a great deal of information. Because of the scientific nature of the material, I would suggest the addition of visuals to assist the reader. The inclusion of graphs and charts would help readers digest the vast quanity of statistics presented.It seems that the authors sporatic attempts to ""personalize"" the text by romanticizing the Sound act to discredit. I'm referring to passages like ""I had the strongest sense of th oil being incoporated by the Sound, even embraced."" Descriptions such as this and others that appear on the following page(132) detract from the book. They don't appear to ""mix"" with the hard science text. This incongruence caused me to wonder who his intended audience was.I think the book focuses on problems without offering solutions. The afterward seemed shallow, as if the author was rushed or tired. Wheelwright missed an opportunity for a heart to heart with his audience."
1,mmsalesinc Never again...,"I ordered one of these puppies fron mmsalesinc. It was advertised as NEW! When it got here the package was opened and the cable did not work. I contacted Hosa to make sure that the cable was not working properly. After determining that it was bad they gave me an RA number and are sending me a new one. I left mmsalesinc a feedback similar to what I am here. He told me if I would retract my feedback he would refund my money and send me a brand new cable. Okay... I retracted my feedback. He did give me a refund, but the cable he offered to me was another ""new, but opened"" cable - the last one he had. I need the cable, so I said I would take it... I never got it.This sounds like I'm whining about this all but, what I really mean to do is voice a warning about mmsalesinc. 5 stars to Hosa... 0 stars to mmsalesinc."
1,Buy only if you like rerecords,"I am a big Stella fan and have many of her songs on '45. So I was delighted to see an anthology and could hear the old songs again without the scratches. Was very disappointed as the songs, especially the hits are rerecords. If you like the original songs, don't buy this album. If you don't really care, then the songs are close enough to be a good listen."
1,Don't buy this CD,"In case any of you have ever had a chance to hear the ORIGINAL versions of these songs, you might agree Stella's pretty good, though not as good as her sister. She had a string of Top 20 Country hits in the late 1970's that included one Top 10, therefore defining herself as a Nashville talent. Nevertheless, the normally incredible Renaissance pulled a fast one here and they obviously think that buyers are too stupid to realize it. These are ALL rerecordings of her music. So, if you want to try Stella, buy a record before you buy this waste of a CD."
5,Crosswinds,"I was so happy to read more about ""Cat"". I first observed her to be somewhat shallow. But as true with most people, the more you get to know them, the more you see their inner strength. A delightful little spit fire, she is."
2,Mediocre civil war,"I might enjoy this more if I had read the other books first. I didn't know this was part of a series and bought it to read civil war, but the writer obviously isnt familiar with the period because she made mistakes with the battles and customs. I wanted a happier ending. Cat has a miscarriage and her husband has to go back to the war. I never find out if he survives or not. It wasn't finished and Im not interested enough to read the next book."
1,Boring!,"I was so bored within the first 30 pages that I jumped ahead to see if it became any better. It did not. This book was not only boring, it was immature writing. I could not finish reading it."
2,not for tall parents,"I bought this baby carrier with amazon but I have returned it asap. It was in great condition and I got a fast and complete refund, so I'm not complaining. I just want to share a piece of advise: I am 1,74 m tall and my husband 1,82 m tall (a little taller then the average). When my husband tried it on, we realized you cannot change the lenght of the shoulder lace, then the back of the carrier, which I thought would rest on his hips, was instead placed in the middle of his back, right under his shoulder blades. This was disappointing since the reason I chose this carrier was that a Chicco carrier I bought in Italy with my first child, weighed all on my shoulders causing me a terrible shoulder inflammation which required strong medication to be cured.Don't buy this item if you are someway tall. I'll buy a ""baby hawk"" or ""beco"", since I think you can adjust the shoulder's lenght with them, but I'll make my husband try it on first in a store!!"
2,Manual for dummies,"This manual teaches general concepts of how all of the Yamaha jet skis work. However, lacks model specific information and pictures."
3,Professor Wally Jay's 90th B-Day Tribute,"If you are a Wally Jay fan then you will enjoy this over-view of his 90th birthdaycelebration. I was hoping to see the same audio visual tribute presentation that was shownat the birthday dinner but unfortunately that was not included. However, I still enjoyedthe tribute and the demonstrations shown."
2,A confused political diatribe,"Bowlby intermingles and confuses a variety of separate issues. The book is advertised as an evaluation of why the human body is designed for eating plant foods. In fact the book wanders far afield and spends too much time discusssing issues that are not relevant. The ethical issues of eating meat, the economical issues associated with eating meat and the political issues associated with eating meat are COMPLETELY UNRELATED to whether our bodies are designed to eat meat. If our bodies are designed to eat meat, then we have to eat meat, a fact that Bowlby cannot comprehend."
2,"OK, just don't expect easy flexibility",The spring loaded button that allows you to raise or lower a pc screen doesn't work very well but it does easily swivel from side to side. It will securely hold a decent sized monitor. I attached mine to a work station using screws driven directly into the wood.
3,Not adjustable enough for me,"It's well made, but the height adjustment is a little stiff to operate. It does not allow the monitor to go below the level of the top of the stem on the clamp. From the photos, I thought it might. It is, however, sturdy and reasonably easy to assemble. I had no issues with the tilt or swivel adjustments for the monitor itself and found it easy to get the monitor ""square"" after I moved it in or out from my desk. I ended up getting the LX version from the same company for my purposes, but kept this one in order to mount a second monitor. For the price, it is okay."
2,Aggravating,"Installed two of these via a through desk mount (not the clamp). Adjusting the arms isn't quick as it's difficult to reach and change the adjustment points while holding the monitor in position (recommend having someone else helping out with this). My issue was that regardless of how I adjusted them, I could not get two monitors to line up with each other. There was always at least a 1.5"" vertical difference between the two. Would probably be fine if you're using a single monitor. I ended up returning them. Really appreciate Amazon's return policy! Kudos to Amazon."
4,Great monitor stand.,Great build quality and very flexible. I am building a zero gravity PC workstation and this arm is one of the few that tilts down more than 15 degrees.
2,a major flaw,"I was excited to receive and install the Neo-Flex and initially delighted with it. It's well-constructed and fairly easy to install.But after using it for three weeks, I have a major complaint: The vertical extending range is just not sufficient. I've been suffering significant back pain and part of the reason is that I'm looking *down* at my monitor. It's cranked up to the absolute maximum height -- which i measure at 15.5"" -- and it's well below my typical (read: average) sitting position, in a regular desk/task chair. I estimate that this type of device should extend vertically about 21"" from the top of a desk, to put a monitor at eye-level for a typically-sized person. (i.e., me)So, I'm having to return this product. I would gladly buy a similar product from the same company, but only if I can confirm that the vertical extension range is adequate."
1,BROKEN ARM.BROKEN ARM.,BROKEN ARM WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE. BROKEN ARM WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE! BROKEN ARM. UNACCEPTABLE. BROKEN ARM. UNACCEPTABLE. BROKEN ARM. UNACCEPTABLE. BROKEN ARM. UNACCEPTABLE. BROKEN ARM. UNACCEPTABLE. BROKEN ARM. UNACCEPTABLE.
5,Ergotron 45-174-300 Neo-Flex LCD Arm-Extension Grommet Desk Mount,"This is a most precise piece of equipment. Comes with everything you might need for installation. Totally intuitive, no need to read instructions. Very high quality hardware. Extremely versatile."
4,Ergotron,Installation was a bit of a pain as well as adjusting it. It could be a 2 person job depending on the size of the monitor. Overall pretty solid product.
3,It's so so.,"I bought this product and had no trouble mounting my Apple 23"" HD display on it.It's a little bit weak at the joints and doesn't go all that high.It also does not have springs to balance the weight of the monitor.Otherwise it is fine."
3,Nice but poor quality control,The mount was pretty much as advertised and it works pretty well. The up-down motion of the arm that connects to the monitor is somewhat limited in that height of the monitor can go from horizontal up -- but not below horizontal. This means that if you mount the arm above a desk -- like on shelf just above a desk -- you can't bring the monitor down low enough to be comfortable.My major complaint was a broken screw. The stiffness of the swing arm is controlled by how tight a screw is tightened. In my case the head of that screws was broken off. It was obviously over tightened at the factory and shipped out as is. Not enough of an issue to send it back (25 cents at the HW store) but irritating none the less.
4,Great Product,Took a bit to figure out the diagrams for this but once I puzzled that out works great.
2,Bolts,"To stop the monitor from drooping and suddenly dropping during use, I've had to tighten the bolts so tight with the allen wrench that theyre beginning to strip. I'm assuming they're going to need further adjustment as time goes by, from the monitor weight and rotation use. It's probably only a matter of time before they're stripped beyond usability, and I'll have to exchange it for another one.It also didn't come with long enough screws to fit the back of my monitor, so I had to buy some longer ones. Not that big of a deal in itself, but overall this product doesn't work as well as I'd hoped."
2,Doesn't adjust easily,"If you need to put your monitor in one position and leave it there then this works great. If you only need push it back and pull it forward, then it will probably work ok. If you need to frequently raise, lower, tilt, or rotate your monitor, then look elsewhere. Raising and lowering is awkward, but workable. Tilting and rotating requires you to get out the allen wrench and loosen/tighten the joints every time. This is difficult to do by yourself and works a lot better if someone else can hold the monitor while you loosen/tighten the joints."
2,Not impressed,"I think mine was put together wrong because there is no way to adjust the outer arm, I tried to adjust it but it is pretty much locked in place. It has the style and look to be a nice arm but the fact it just does not adjust ruined it for me. If i was able to i would have returned it, but being out of the country i didnt have that luxury"
2,Did not work for me,"This seems well made but had two problems:1. It requires a lot of clearance under the table so it can be properly clamped. It will work best with a simple table. Desks with features below the table top are a problem.2. I could not get it to adjust height. I think the unit I received was defective, but there were no decent instructions with the unit."
4,Great Desk Mount,This is one of the best desktop monitor mounts. I have 3 of them and they all work wonderfully. Very sturdy and all joints can be tightened with an Allen wrench to make them rigid. The only downfall of this device is that it doesnt add much height adjustability. You can raise and lower the monitor but say you want to raise one monitor above another then this is not the device. The LX version of this is different and possibly better but this model here is probably your best deal for the price.
3,Didn't work for my needs,"When i got it i realized i got what i paid for - let me explain: I was trying to use this arm to mount my new 23"" LED LCD on my desk to use as a computer monitor when set in the most upright position, then swing the arm around and down for watching TV from the couch in front of my desk. This arm doesn't really do that - it swivels left to right well but don't expect to be adjusting tilt or monitor height on a daily basis as it's just too much hassle. Luckily a set screw on my arm was not fully drilled so it could not stop the bolt from spinning when the arm is turned resulting in the bolt loosening as it was used - this defect let me return it for free. I upgraded to the new and improved Ergotron LX Desk Mount LCD Arm at twice the price but providing a tensioning spring for lifting and tilting the monitor."
4,Great for the money!!! I bought 2!,"I have dual Samsung 19in 940BW (widescreens) and mounted them to my Matrix Glass desk with the clamps...install was short and easy, only about 15 min for each. It def matched my desks silver scheme. The screws / bolts were a bit too tight from the factory...I don't need to move my arms around much, but from what other reviews are saying, these are not meant for that function. For $60 and free shipping (which was fast), these are def a good value!!! I checked EVERYWHERE online and you won't find anything cheaper. Ergotron is pretty reputable company..I worked for Morgan Stanley on the trading floor for IT and most of the Bloomberg stands were on Ergotron's."
3,Not For Girls~!!,"I wouldn't buy this again, I am making ""do"" with it because it took me so long to get it in a position that I can ""tolerate"" but it is very difficult to push the release button on the arm and move the monitor to the position you want it in. It has very limited range and the up and down adjustment is predetermined in spaced knotches so you are ""stuck"" either 3 inches high or 3 inches lower than you want. If you just want your monitor off your desk and keep it in the same location all the time, then I'd say you will be OK with this, but if you need something you can adjust while you're working, this is NOT the arm you want."
2,Don't buy if you need to raise and lower often.,"Be aware before you by that this arm does not keep the monitor parallel when raising and lowering in contrast to other monitor arms. This has an unfortunate side effect that the axle at the end of the arm can end up at an angle where it has to fight gravity to keep the monitor up, which it isn't strong enough to do, so it flops over unless you align it perfectly.Basically speaking, when you raise the monitor, it is difficult to find a position where it won't flop over, and requires a minute or two of fiddling every time to find a stable configuration. If all you are doing is pushing the monitor back and forth on your desk then this might work for you. However, don't expect to be able to raise it and lower it effortlessly. It's a pain. The more expensive arms have this issue solved."
5,Value for money,"Great product, value for money. Just received and installed it with my 19"" LCD monitor. Some joints were a bit tight, but I could loosen them with the allen key. Am planning to buy another one."
5,Well Designed,"Installed it out of the box with little need for directions as I used the under desk clamp that is the default. Looks great and moves in most directions. The only compaint is the little clear plastic cord holders do not work that well, but didn't matter to me. Definately a high quality product."
4,Excellent Arm,Had it about two weeks now with no problems holds my 22' monitor beautifully. takes a little adjusting at first because it is a little stiff but overall a great buy for the price $67.00
4,LCD Arm,"This is the second one that I purchased, it serves my purpose(not obstructing my desktop). I have not tried other brand,but this one is good enough for me."
4,Professional Office Setting,"This monitor arm is very sleek and attractive. Its up and down adjustment is a bit limited but is ok for my setting in a financial industry but may not be for a work space other than a desk setting. Its side to side movement is very easy and can be loosened or tightened as needed. There are friction adjusters at each joint on the entire arm that can adjusted as needed for your particular usage. It comes with an adapter for a second size mount on the back of the screen. All in all a good choice, very good looking piece of equipment for a professional office environment."
3,"Good looks, terrible adjustment method.","Looks nice and easy setup/install, but the adjustment method is just plain bad all around. The worst part is the vertical arm adjustment, the ""button"" you have to push in order to raise/lower the long arm is very hard to push and not at all obvious (in the directions or on the product itself). Not to mention that even though the button does push in, only when you fidget with the weight, the arm doesn't actually lift or lower. Maybe it's just a defect with my particular item. I will find out tomorrow when I give them a phone call. /crossfingers"
4,versitile,"strong, easy to install comes with hardwate for wall or desk mountI am actuallu adapting this device to use as a book holder, since I am disabled and it is dificult for me to hold books for an rxtended period"
5,"Fine service, fine product, right price",I recommend this product from this seller. The arm is great for the price. Prompt shipping.
4,Colorful Cases,The 10pk mini CD cases I received are colorful and easy to open and close. One small criticism would be that on previous plastic cases I have used you could hear an audible snap when the CD was fixed to the round center post. If I don't hear that sound I think the CD is not in there properly - but I found it was. Not a big deal but just a little issue to get used to.
3,Not So Comfortable,"I heard about crocs forever because many nurses at my job swear by them, so, I ordered these, thinking that I would experience great comfort. Well, that was not the case. They are too flat for me and I am working hard to heal my plantar fasciitis. I will try to add an orthotic to them to see if it is any better, but for now, I say if you have foot problems, avoid these shoes."
4,Don't like the laces?,"Take the laces out and replace them with same size elastic cord... Then tie back up. Elastic cord will ""give"" enough to allow you to slide on and off (just don't pull and tie to tight.....)..."
3,good...but,"Good comfortable shoe, great for comfort. Real bad on wet hard surfaces, real bad, 1 fall, many slips."
3,"Good, but not as good as other Crocs","I have these in 2 colors. They are okay, but the footbed does not seem to be the same quality as other Croc models. The arch support seems to be less."
2,Nostalgy...,"This album by veteran British band Blitzkrieg seems to have been recorded at the beginning of the eighties. It's almoste incredible: production values, songs, vocal approach, everything will amke you feel that this album was indeed recorded somewhere around 1980-1982 and only realeased now!But that does not mean this is a good NWOBHM record. I sounds like an inferior NWOBHM record... It's an album totally forgettable."
3,HARD HITTING WITH A SOFT BUT GENEROUS CORE,As the heading says but also quite engrossing too. The viewer does get to know the characters even though much of the film is action. Ironic I know but I have seen slower films that are less engaging both darmatically and emotionally. So it's not a classic but if watched on a staurday afternoon or a tuesday night I guarentee you could spend an hour or two less usefully. The word fun is inadequate and too shiny a phrase perhaps. I would say the word that sums this film up is 'crunchy'. umm... nice contrast of expressions. Look out for the incredible Kathy Shower looking stunning as per usual...
4,mark twain sam australia WA Perth,"I liked this movie because it had lots of martial arts action. The plot is about a kidnapped daughter, Lillian (Kathy Shower) is the mother of the daughter and turns to two men who she knows she can count on to help her. One of the men is Mike(Dale 'apollo' Cook)a hard-nosed L.A cop with a reputation of doing things his own way: the hard way. The other man is her former lover David (Evan Lurie) a martial arts expert whose exsplosive temper is a lethal compliment to his formidable skill in kikcboxing. After Lillians daughter is kidnapped the kidnapper Xavier (Ted Markland) will release the kid for a $2 million dollar ransom."
4,Torn by good product,My friend whom I got this for loved it. Though I was annoyed it had a tear in it. =/
1,Only an observer,"In writing this book, we are certain that Mr. Cornwell remains, as always, only an observer of the See of Peter and the Roman Pontiff. His book stems from his observations and not from any understanding of the Catholic Faith. As is, the book is comparable to the upset neighbour's report on how the next door family operates. A book of conclusions made from his accounts of listening to fragmented conversations, peeking through the windows, and looking at some gardenwork done around the house. The only way to understand the Church and John Paul II is to join the family and have a seat at the dinner table. Until then, it will remain an annoyance for the neighborhood and a scandal to the un- and missinformed."
4,Pontiff In Winter,"I am thoroughly enjoying the audio CD of the Pontiff in Winter by John Cornwell. The reader, John Lee, speaks the narrative eloquently so it is easy to listen to while driving in the car. The story describes little known facts about Pope John Paul II as well as other Popes and important Vatican figures, both positive and negative. It exposes and discusses timely events such as the Priest Pedophile scandal and other political news and events that are rarely addressed in public. It is interesting to hear a behind-the-scenes version."
1,please,It's one thing to disagree with the Pope it's another to write a mean spirited pack of half truths. I bought this assumeing it was a biography of the Popes final years. WRONG it is an angry polemical agenda driven anti-JPII book. Waste of my $.
1,No thanks ......,"I received the recommendation for this book via an Amazon promo email based on what I've previously purchased ( Catholicism for Dummies) and wanted to respond. This book has nothing in common with Catholicism for Dummies, - or any other Catholic book I've purchased from Amazon. If you like for example, what Garry Wills writes, then you'll probably like Mr. Cornwell also, - but get a library copy, then you wouldn't have wasted your money. For a more thoroughly researched biography of John Paul II, - with no spin on it, read Witness to Hope by George Weigel, or The Courage to be Catholic, also by Weigel. I'd also suggest the new book- The Miracle detective, by Randall Sullivan, writer and editor for Rolling Stone."
2,History oriented,"This small book covers too little. Further, it seems disjointed with one of the authors writing the chapters with a historical perspective and the other dishing out the present and future perspective.The history is covered well enough for the book's size with the 'Sabre-killing' air to air victories of the IAF over PAF being emphasized over the equally critical ground support role (for example, the Pakistan army tank busting Hunters of Longewla and troop transportion in general).Overall, the authors could have done much better even in the given size with more in-depth analysis. More pictures would also have helped."
1,Incomplete analysis,"It appears the authors have two bias -- anti-hard work and anti-analysis. I wonder if they actually got to visit any of the bases or talk to any real pilots. Based on the book, one could get the impression that in a war the IAF could be neutralized simply by waiting until they run out of spares! China/Pakistan -- take heed!"
2,very disappointed,"did not receive the flat iron pictured, rather a cheaper knock off version, initial heat up, the flat iron smells awful. very disappointed. definitely not a babyliss! ive only used babyliss for years, and just by appearance and weight, i know its not the same. in need of a full refund!"
5,Surpassingly delightful!,"I loved this documentary. I loved the way Tammy Faye exposed the duplicitous Jerry fawell- if only for this, you should watch this film. But there is so much more: how our culture loves watching people rise to the top, only to love even more when they crash and self-destroy. However, a more interesting premise is the idea that persecution of the Bakers may have been a great injustice? I found this film to be very delightful, such a reflection of the 80s. Watch it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,"AN AWESOME HUMAN BEING, TAMMY THAT IS!","After watching this, my whole way of thinking about Tammy changed. That's to show, don't judge nobody until you get to know them. She is a wonderful person, warm hearted and caring about people no matter who or what they are. She's a living legend. God bless her and keep her. Every other money hungry jack-ass can go straight to hell. She stands alone. Right ON Tammy!"
5,Wild proof of a parallel universe we never see,"This DVD is sheer fun, your entrance to a parallel universe you did not know exists. A wonderful biography of Tammy's incredible life with evangelist Jim Bakker, the fairy-tale world they built from nothing, and their sad downfall from TV heaven. Not to be deterred, Tammmy rebuilds a life on her own and wins your admiration. Excellent editing and documentary writing make this one unbelievable laugh after another. I'm snapping up used copies for my friends."
4,Insightful,"During their peak I ran across Jim and Tammy Fae while channel surfing and watched a while. Reminded me of old quotes of how fools and their money are soon parted and how there's a sucker born every minute. This DVD pretty much tells all and makes sense of it. You'll learn how Tammy Fae, a Minnesota country bumpkin from an impoverished family of 7 siblings got sucked into the world of tele-evangelism. The video lays it all out, makes no excuses and offers little in the way of apology. You'll learn about the competitive ""business"" of TV religion and the likes of such characters as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. An eye opener."
4,Never thought I'd see the day!!!!,"Tammy Faye is now someone I admire!I purchased this as a vague curiosity after reading some other reviews. I thought these people have GOT to be wrong. No...it turns out I was.This is actually a very telling account not only of Tammy Faye, but of televangelism (If you thought Jerry Falwell was evil before...you will see him as Satan Incarnate after viewing this). I will say that I thought of Tammy Faye as master media manipulator...but after seeing this...I honestly don't think so.One of the things this documentary subtley conveys is that Tammy Faye is more resilliant than she is brilliant. I think it's just her natural tenacity that has kept her going and has drawn media attention like flies. I think she's a person who has a genuine good heart who has just too much naievete for the world of evangellical broadcasting.Overall, I was amazed how much I had warmed up to her by the end of the film, and honestly gained a whole new respect for her ability to never say die."
3,Not as good as I'd heard,"I did come away from the film with new respect for Tammy Faye's strength and integrity, if not for her fashion- or common-sense, but I felt that the filmmakers had already said all they had to say long before the film was over. The filmmakers were obviously quite taken with their subject, which gave me some doubts about their objectivity in such matters as Jerry Falwell's role in the downfall of PTL (although I have no trouble seeing Falwell as a villain). The hand puppets were a bit too precious for my taste, and the reunion with Jim J. Bullock was so awkward that I'm surprised that the filmmakers didn't edit it out."
5,Very timely!,"Arrived to me within three or four days of ordering. Great service, and in great shape."
3,Not as good as the Rules For Getting Laid,"I just read this book and the Rules For Getting Laid and felt that this title was not as hard hitting, nor as useful as the Rules book. While I think Melton has a good grasp on the subject, he doesn't present enough ideas and practical things to do to meet and date women. Shwartz and Graff do present a roadmap on how to be a super stud."
4,Right On The Money!,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me. While I am not looking to get ""laid,"" it does provide prescient insight into why nice, sweet guys get so frustrated in the dating scene. It always used to bother me how these nice gals in school were going out with jerks that cheated on them or treated them badly. Guess what? These gals keep coming back for more. I would recommend this book to all the ""Nice Guys"" in the world. It showed me that there are other ""Nice Guys"" out there that are as frustrated as I am with these odd creatures called 'women.'"
3,A joke book. Buy it for laughs.,"This book is more humor that useful instructions. The author does make an interesting point that I think is valid. He claims that abusive men attract more women. There is some truth to this in that being abusive is the male version of playing hard to get. When a man insults a woman the woman may think ""Oh! I'm losing him. I better DO SOMETHING!"" Of course, you can't use this manipulative technique all the time. Even the most dimwitted female with catch on after a while."
3,a relax reading,in brief this books tells that being a jerk is a good way to attract women. but the book doesn't really tell you how to get laid :-) fun reading though.
5,hilarious,"This book was hilarious. It does poke fun at women, but only in the context of poking fun at the mating game in general. Men don't get portrayed any better than women in the book.I've read No More Mr. Nice Guy! by Robert Glover and some others like Doc Love on the Ask Men web site, so I was familiar with the premises of the book before reading it. If I had not, though, I would have found this book enlightening. You have to be able to separate the humor from the kernels of truth that it's based on. When you're trying to be funny about a subject you have to take some liberties and exaggerate. That's what the author does and it makes some people mad.Anyway, I loved the book and recommend it highly."
3,Funny and has some merit,Don't let the sad sack title fool you. This is a humorous though cynical take on women's choices. The author will make you chuckle your way to some wisdom on the lame choices some women make.
2,Don't get the wrong impression,"The purpose of this book is to give you a laugh. He makes some generalizations and observations that have a bit of truth to them and makes them funny. This book will not show you how to deal with women, unless you're planning to become a punk to fit his humor."
3,Book was sold as new but had writing in it.,"This book was advertised as being new, looked to be in good condition, but many of the pages had highlighting, notes and other markings."
3,Embraced by the Light,I did not find this book particualarly stimulating.I got the impression that part of it was make-believe. I have read other near-death experiences and not got this feeling.
1,NOT buying this story!,"I finally got around to reading this book. I was not impressed, in a nutshell.As a person who has had numerous interactions with the spirit world, what Ms. Eadie describes as her near death experience does not ring true. I don't know if she was having a very vivid dream, a drug reaction or something else, how she describes life on the other side comes across as phoney and unbelievable. I was very disappointed with this book. A waste of time and money (I borrowed this copy from the library, I'm glad I didn't pay for it)."
5,Everyone should read this book,This book is wonderful! It gives hope and peace and fills the reader with heavenly joy. I recommend it to everyone who wants a spiritual lift and peace of heart! :) I especially recommend it to anyone who is afraid of death or struggling with the death of a loved one. I would also recommend it to anyone struggling with the meaning or purpose of their life.
1,A total waste of money!,"I have read book after book on life after death, reincarnation, visions, various religions,EVP, spirituality, etc. This book is the ONLY book I felt was an insult to my intelligence! I felt so strongly about how insulting this book was that I would have fined the author for expecting ANYONE to be stupid enough to believe her bizarre story! I have never felt so strongly about a book in my life! Not only did I want a refund of my money, I wanted a refund of the time I wasted on it! This book definitely belongs in the FICTION section."
2,non-believable,"I bought this book several years ago at a thrift store. After I finished reading it I threw it away. This story is a mixture of Christianity and New Age beliefs. The part where she meets the being of light is where I became skeptical. From what I remember the being never said he was Jesus Christ, she assumed it was Him which is dangerous. For all we know it may have been Lucifer who can also appear as a being of light. And her revelation that it doesn't matter what faith you believe isn't biblical at all. I kind of wish I still had the book so I can look up whether the 'being' told her that or she came to that conclusion on her own. I don't remember much of the book but those 2 points alarmed me."
1,This is not Christianity,"If you attack this book, you are not attacking Christianity. If you want to learn something about Christianity, stay away from this book - read the Bible instead. Eadie consistently denies the foundational ideas about Jesus and salvation found in the Bible and therefore cannot be seen as a representative of Christianity any more than a Buddhist monk would be.Believe what you want about Jesus, but understand that Embraced By The Light is not talking about the same Jesus described in the Bible."
5,so glad I read this book,"I recently lost a brother. A friend loaned our mother this book. The book didn't answer all my questions, but it did address a significant portion of them. I found her story captivating and comforting, and I intend to buy my own copy so I can highlight the most meaningful portions. The author describes heaven as a place so wonderful that she did not want to return to her body. If you're wondering where your deceased loved ones are now, I recommend reading this book."
5,Helps with death issues,This book helped me greatly in dealing with the death of my mother. It gave me a different concept of the afterlife. I was also greatly helped by the book An Encounter With a Prophet. I would recommend reading both books if you are dealing with such issues
5,great feeling and great hope,"I was so exhausted everything about my life. I had been stressed and felt hopeless for many years. One day, one of my good friends gave me this book as a gift. And I read it. Since then, my life became much better, and I realized all the tough time I had has some sort of meanings. This book is very easy to read and makes you happy so much."
2,This is not the final word on NDEs,"I would ask anyone to also consider Ring's Heading Toward Omega, and even Blackmore's Dying To Live, also Farr's What Tom Sawyer Learned from Dying"
4,embraced by the light,"A gread book for someone grieving the loss of a loved one. Good primer for the study of the spirit world. Believable, not sensational."
5,Beautiful book,"This book should be read by anyone who is questing to find reasons for living, hope for the end of life, or grieving a loved one. It gives such a calmness and hope for the next step after our life on earth. This is a book with ideas you will never forget and the author is very clear and compassionate in her approach to what she feels everyone should know from what she learned of the afterlife...a must read."
5,A Must Read!,"Embraced By The Light is absolutely wonderful! Itis a must read for anyone, who doubts the existenceof another world beyond the one we live in.It is insightful and emotional, and speaks freelyand frankly about life on the otherside. If youdon't believe me...just read the book.I have encouraged many of my families and friendsto read this book. Mrs.Eadie does a remarkable job,and should be given credit for being honest and braveenough to come forward with such a personal experience.Knowing that people would more than likelycriticize such an event, she believed enough inherself to write about her accounts.If you do anything for yourself...........buy thisbook, you won't regret it!"
4,Very inspiring and spiritually fulfilling,"As I read through the lines of Betty J. Eadie's NDE account,I realized how truly special we are. That the idea of deathis not the end, not painful; is something very comforting tolearn. Now I am a firm believer that we, human beings, areall important, all souls with a mission in life and that ourtime on earth is a very important one as well."
3,Over Zealous Author,"The general premise of the book was very enlightening and enforces the concept that we should all get along and love one another. We are all energy. This I understand. But when it comes to exact descriptions of what angels and Jesus looked like as far as what they wore, the authenticity of her experience flies out the window for me."
5,amazing story whether true or not,"The book inspired me to be a better person and to consider my actions more thoroughly. It was hard to put down, and is reassuring about death and what lies beyond. I'm not sure what motivation the author would have had to make it up, so I hope she didn't; it is a wonderful read."
5,Comforting Book,"I read this book years ago, and keep a copy around to give to people who have lost a loved one. I recently gave one to a friend and she said it was so comforting that she ordered 5 copies for her extended family!"
1,A Spiritual Terrorist wrote this book,"The person behind this book has been deceived by demons and or is seeking to destroy peoples souls by following the hell bound lies in this book. I have been reading the refutation of this book in the book ""The Glory of Heaven"" by John MacArthur. I also read a refutation in ""Invasion of other gods"" by David Jeremiah, & ""One Minute after you die"" by Erwin Lutzer. Do not believe the lies in Embraced by the light for its written by someone preaching another gospel (Gal 1:8-9)."
1,Mormonism in another package.,"While this book might bring hope to some, it may be a false hope. Try reading ""Deceived by the Light"" to get an idea of what I'm talking about. For a truely uplifting experience, try reading the Holy Bible. It may not be as open and accepting to all the religions of the world as Embraced by the Light - but that's what makes it beleivable. There's only one truth - yet many lies. But the truth is the truth; to some, it burns like fire; to others, it's an eternal comfort."
2,My view for a good read,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, however, when I read for a while, I found it a chore to finish it. Then I read how the Author is a hypnotherapist, which explained why I had trouble reading it. I would not have bought the book if I'd known this."
2,Eh... Not worth your time if you're non-christian,"This book, despite the fact that it does have some uplifting moments, is very heavily slanted through the filter of the author's christian beliefs and as such is rendered quite suspect. Due to this, I was fairly skeptical through the book, up until I came across references to warring angels doing battle with Satan, at which point I just tossed the book aside.There are other, and better, and more open and loving, books on NDEs out there; they're far more worth your time than this one."
5,Incredible Read !,I loved this book. I couldn't put it down until I had read the whole book completely through. It will be one of those treasured books in my library. One of those books you would never consider parting with. If you want to read a great book with a great story I suggest you read it. I guarantee you will love it as much as I did.
2,There may be a kernel of truth in this book...,"but it is obviously heavily embellished. I agree with another reviewer -- it reads a bit too much like a novel.The first couple of chapters (before she even gets to the death experience) really soured me on the whole book. She describes in extreme detail events that happened over 20 years before, in such a melodramatic fashion that it casts doubts on the credibility of the very powerful, beautiful account of her supposed NDE.I read this book in one night soon after experiencing a devastating loss. I would really like to believe that this is a truthful account of a NDE. But something about it just doesn't ring true....Having said that, it is a quick, enjoyable read -- great for a rainy afternoon, perhaps, but not something one should base their entire belief system upon!"
2,"Interesting, But Unconvincing","This book is interesting, but after one gets into it far enough, discrepancies and contradictions which are hard to explain away appear. For example: all religions are valid, but the author's a Christian and she meets Jesus in heaven. Other improbable ideas include: spirits learning things by returning to a lower level, the experience depending on her beliefs here on earth, her praise of self-denial, reincarnation, etc. Even as it attempts to spread Christian propaganda, it doesn't stick to mainstream Christian theology. For me to seriously consider what she is saying, I'd need a little more objective view from someone perhaps who had an NDE but didn't have any convictions about religion at all."
2,One nagging question...,"I read this book a few years ago, when my grandmother was very ill. The book gave me comfort, but left me with one nagging question... Why would heaven, the domain of God, need an army?(I found the answer to that more recently in the writings of Robert Monroe)"
2,Embraced by the light,I did not like this story. I felt that some of the information she received in heaven was really her opinion on certain subjects.
5,One of the best books ever!!,I read this book after losing my father and it made me feel so much better. This book is inspirational and is just beautiful. I have read this book twice and I really feel comforted in reading it. The details she is able to remember about heaven is wonderful and makes you realize we have a home to go to after we part from this world. I love this book and recommend it to everyone!
3,Interesting (to be sure),"This tape was quite an intersting story. Although believeable, I found it difficult to grasp, she could remember word for word & have such an ""exact"" recall. I would never berate anyone's experiences, as I've had several of my own. I wish I could be so exacting in my rememberances as Ms. Eadie."
5,Very comforting for anyone facing death,Betty Eadie has courage for sharing the spiritual lessons she learned. It gives the reader a warm and uplifting experience. Her story is particularly comforting for mothers. Traditionalists may be threatened by her report of the spiritual world and what really matters. I hope this book can open a few more minds and hearts.
2,Loaded with Fluff,"I only wish I read some of these reviews before purchasing this book. I have books on eastern religions and many books on NDEs. She made conclusions that are biased with her Mormon beliefs. She mentions that she learned that every religion is neither right or wrong; however, states that one will go to hell if not saved by Jesus Christ. Please, God loves all his children and I dont believe he cares about what religious belief you practiced. Its all about your Karma and your soul. So many books on this subject make this a point. The part where she tells about the council of men and then her farewell and returning to her body was unbelievable to me and just silly. It appears that she is doing sequels to this book and writing other similar topics. It amazes me how some of these authors profit on this stuff. One reviewer was right on point. The title should be Embracing the Cash!"
2,Great reading!,"I purchased this book years ago ... since it was the holiday season and I knew my sister would enjoy this book so I decided to ship it to her. It's just a couple of days after New Years day so I haven't heard from her yet BUT ... I can tell you it is a great book. Keeps you reading and reading even if you're tired and want to sleep. This book has traveled to Viet Nam and back with another friend who loved it too and gave it back as I requested ... I won't give this book up because I like to re-read it every so often ... yes, it's that good!!!"
3,"Magical, in a pull a rabbit out of a hat kind of way...","This book was given to me by a friend who called it ""life changing""... for me, not so much.As a story, it's a nice tale... but it begs all sorts of questions if it's to be taken as a true autobiographical experience.You know how when you were reading ""A million little pieces"" you found yourself totally NOT believing that someone experienced root canal without sedation or pain control of any kind? I think you might find yourself with similar thoughts of disbelief here too... Perhaps it's just the medical professional in me that finds a lot of her accounts to be improbable, but I suspect even a layperson would have to wonder how legitimate her death (or near death) experience really was.I would recommend this book for it's cheerful anecdotes with caution to the reader that much of what you are about to read is based on a wonderful imagination and the authors cunning ability to share it with us."
5,OMG THIS BOOK WAS GREAT!,THIS BOOK WAS SIMPLY AMAZING! I HONESTLY COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! BETTY EDDIE DID AN AMAZING JOB IN WRITING HER NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE! THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY A MUST READ!
5,fast,arrived to my house fast and not damaged. I was expecting it to take about a week but it only took a couple days.
1,Pure BS.,An attempt to align afterlife experiences with religious/church dogma and personal belife. Possible creation of immediate afterdeath experiences with already developed beliefs. A disservice to other researchers in this area.
1,Embraced by the light..... isit fiction,"I found the story quite enteresting, however, it goes against allot of the things I have been taught and or read in my Bible. I find it very difficult to believe the entire story although it has some very good points. It is always good to have more love and respect for others in this world. I agree that we are here for a reason we have something to learn and something to teach. Her story is very positive and it may very well be true, I just find it difficult to believe in it's entirety. I wish her lots of love and luck in all her writings, and hopefully if she is telling the absolute truth, we will all know someday and in which case I am sorry I doubted her."
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!,"I AM AN OUTRAGED FORMER READER OF THIS BOOK. I actually believed in what she wrote during my teenage years and when I found myself pregnant at the age of 18, i remembered her quote of ""the baby's soul understands the parents right to abortion"". I ALMOST ABORTED THE ONLY THING IN LIFE THAT SAVED ME FROM A LIFE OF DEPRESSION, DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND A MISERABLE LIFE!!! Thank God that I did not go through with it. My baby is the BEST THING that has ever happened to me. He is a wonderful GORGEOUS obedient little boy that is the center of my joy. READERS OUT THERE: DON'T BELIEVE HER B.S.!!!! SHE'S A FRAUD AND I BURNED THE COPY THAT I HAD WHICH IS ONLY KNOWN TO BE SATANIC! DON'T FALL FOR IT! PRO-LIFE! TO BETTY: YOU SAY ABOUT KARMA?? WELL UR KARMA AND END IS HELL!!!"
1,A Good Book if You Are In the Mood For Comedy,"I can see why all the hype when this book came out, but a better look at this book will reveal that there is nothing metaphysical besides some visual and auditory hallucinations similar to what you would find in a psychiatric hospital. Easy to read and intriguining no doubt, yet it falls short in reality."
1,"Are you sure, Ms. Eadie???","I took a look at this book, hoping to gain someadditional spiritual insight along with whatI've read in other books. By the time I got tothe chapter on Ms. Eadie's death, I already started questioning the accuracy of herreport on her near-death experience. For onething, it seems to focus on a Christian point ofview, leaving no room for other faiths.From another passage I read, I got thisimpression that God segregates between thetwo sexes and treats one as being ""morespiritual"" than the other.For anyone who wants a good introductionto spirituality, I recommend Wayne Dyer'sbook, ""Your Sacred Self"", instead.""Embraced by the Light"" simply didn't cutit.<P"
5,the best of all books,have passed on to all my family and my friends iI play the audio of Embraced and The awakening heart in my car when I'm going to work or any where. Bette has made my life livable. Recommend to any one who is lost in the living world of today. If someone you know has lost someone close then send Embraced by the LIght to them instead of flowers or a card. It will really save them also.
5,It was a very interesting book.,"I found this book very interesting. Although she obvious beleives she was dead, I don't. However, a lot of what she wrote expanded my outlook on why we are put on this planet, and I deffinately recomend it."
2,Personal and arty,"This over-sized deck has a child-like tone. It is highly personalized. The backs of the cards have the number ""56"" on them, which the author explains as ""my chosen number"". The cards themselves are equally idiosyncratic. The figures on the cards are like dolls, or puppets; their surrounds are simple and whimsical. Another unique feature is a jigsaw puzzle piece on various cards to show whether the influence of the card is masculine, feminine, or both. The designer must have had a great time doing these cards, but the statements they make are far too personal for me to make an archetypal tarot-type connection with. People involved with the theatre, or puppetry, might appreciate them more than I do."
5,Phantasmagoric Theater,"What a fun deck! While some of the art is a little ""dark"" it is mostly just a whimsical look at an old craft. Recommended..."
5,Great for young kids,"I have been using this CD for 8 years in my preschool classroom and had to purchase one for my son because he loves it so much. It has been great for him. The CD is easy to sing to. It has classic songs for children to listen to and sing along with like ABC, Mr.Sun, Take Me Out to the Ballgame, and many more. A variety of singers can be heard including the voices of children."
5,Excellent lively Fun Songs,I like this album because the whole family can enjoy it. There are multiple singers and they all have a different style. They are very fun songs. Our son loves it and we can listen to it too for long periods without it getting on our nerves.
4,Good..but no Thug Mentality,"The new Krayzie Bone album is good. But good is as far as I can go. Krayzie Bone's new clique lacks the style and charisma of the Bone Thugs. The best songs on the album are those where Krayzie Bone is allowed to shine by himself without being held down by his new affiliates. This CD also lacks the star power of Thug Mentality. Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Terror Squad,E-40, and all the others that made the last Krayzie Bone double disc so great. This CD is still good and Krayzie Bone is an excellent story teller and he touches on a lot of thought provoking subjects. I just expected a little more from the back up group."
5,one of my top 15 favourite albums,"I can't believe how great this album actually is, whenever I go thorugh drama I put this or a Tupac-record on to clear up my head.There really aren't any bad songs on this album, but the best ones are: GEMINI, TIME AFTER TIME (which embodies Heavy D's Dont U Know),KNIGHT RIDUZ & TALK TO MYSELF.-Rollin' Up Some Mo- is a funny song becouse it samples that popsong ""A little bit jessiCA, A little bit gina"" or whatever it's called by that guy Lou Bega or Lou Vegas or somthing.If U R a rap-fan u can not dislike this, I don't see how it would be possible."
5,Thuggish-N-Raw it's all THUGLINE baby!,"Everything u ever want to hear... tru thugz u got da leader krayzie bone from bone thugs-n-harmony and da rest of da thugline souljah! raw from da street, they keep it happinin' comin' with moe hit and hitz....platinum rap everytime...i gotta say lareec is pretty tytte in all da song, da best one yet is: if they only knew...and also check out da horrorcore rap from knightriduz it's hella tytte...oh yeah don't forget my thugline souljah song: thug on da line......1*poof*"
5,it grew on me more,"his lyrics and messages are 5 star material all by itself.TM99 was more or less away for krayzie to get out his aggression on his enemies.but on this one krayzie drops some serious knowledge on this cd.time after time,talk with myself can't hustle forever,etc,what deep heartfelt lyrics,SOME of the beats are not as good as i thought they would be.BUT his lyrics is what REALLY drew me into the cd.its a shame bone don't get notice for their GOOD and positive lyrics.also i'm verry interested in lareece her flow is really good.i'm ESPECIALY looking forward to the knight riduz dropping a album.c'mon krayzie don't let them and lareece collect dust."
4,good sound but not what i expected,i was really anticipatin this cd. when i heard it was out i went and got it. there are some really good tracks on this. its not as hard as the first one. and has way to many new voices on it. the thug line artists arent very original. they sound just like all the other meaningless rap artists. nothin new to bring to the table. the only ones worth listenin to are the knight ridaz. these cats are tight. almost sound like bone with theyre voices disguised. i swear the one at the end sounds just like bizzy bone. krayzie like always has that smooth a** flow. hes more cool and relaxed on this. good cd way to many guests. get this if u a krayzie bone fan only.
5,Krayzie deserves props for his music.,"I think that Krayzie deserves his props for his music because in it you can find that there is alot to just being Krayzie Bone. He delivers those hypnotic sounds that makes you get relaxed and moreover..Thugged out. his beats are created by artistic hands and should not be underated. Krayzie is by far the best Bone Thug to ever successfully reach out and touch thug-fans where ever they may be. I am a southern rap artist as well and I can relate to what Krayzie is doing. He is hustling for his and maybe if people open their eyes and see what Krayzie is trying to tell them..then they will accept him not just for his music, but for his Thug Mentality as well. Not only that but for keeping fellow thug members like Wish Bone on the Thug Line. Perhaps Krayzie can help Wish come out with something and then you fans will witness true creativity within Krayzie Bone."
3,Krayzie gone crazy,"This album was a dissapointment. Being a huge bone fan this is defenitely not krayzie's best work. I thought #3, 4, 9, 12, and 20 were the only decent songs on this album. The r n b flavor is tight and he is awsome at it, but some of those keyboard riffs are to polka like. He turned a few songs that could of been a great succes bad. Overall I think it was an ok album. Only buy it if your a die hard fan."
3,Extremely simple overview of Sharepoint,This book is designed for those users wanting a very simple overview of the functionality available in Sharepoint Server. It has almost no information that is not available either with the books that came with Sharepoint or the Online help. The only benefit that this book has in this regard is that it synthesizes this information for the reader.My recommendation is to spend your dollars on another more advanced book and learn the basics from the free resourceas available with Sharepoint.
2,Just A Rehash of Microsoft's info...,"If you are looking for information beyond what's available on Microsoft's site, this book is not for you. It's just an overview of the basic functionality - not much meat - although, I will admit, I did find a proxy server solution that was very useful, however, I bet I could have found the solution on Microsoft's site. I was also very disappointed in its coverage of building custom webparts - again, just goes through the Microsoft overview of using prebuilt ones. I suppose, it might be a good intro for a person who's never heard of Sharepoint Portal Server before, or for someone who is just interested in the concept of it, but if you've read through MS's site information on it, then you've pretty much covered the material in this book."
1,Not good for REAL beginners,This book is totally useless to someone who doesn't already know server basics.
2,Alot of repeating to fill a book,"This really is a beginners guide, it takes you by the hand and says which buttons to click. I finished it in less than 2 days.If you ever need to programatically understand sharepoint, this book is totally useless.If you only need to know what Sharepoint can do for you right out of the box, you can use it."
4,John Rich,I bought this because I am sort of a Big & Rich fan.John Rich is a great songwriter. I think the cd is great - every song!I am looking forward to his next solo project.
3,Only avg. for Carr,"I felt this book was only average for someone of John Dickson Carr's caliber. His usual ""locked room"" formula was not present here, and the plot was only so so. The best part about The Corpse in the Waxworks was the settings of the Wax Museum, and then the Colored Mask Society. Those were both interesting, and gave an eerie air to the story. Unfortunately, I didn't care anything about the characters or whodunnit. The conclusion rang false to me (especially of Odette) and was confusing. The last 2 pages were fascinating, without giving it away, but I was left wanting a bit more explanation.It's a good read, but not up to Carr's usual high standards, in works like The Crooked Hinge, The Three Coffins, or The Problem of the Wire Cage."
4,A Bencolin Mystery,"In the eerie green light of a sepulchral old museum of waxworks the French detective Bencolin stumbles across the body of a young girl with a knife in her back placed in the arms of a sinister figure of the Satyr of the Seine. That same morning the body of another young girl had been found stabbed in the back, floating on the Seine river.Trails lead directly to the infamous Club of the Silver Key: it is known that the propietor's mistress entered the waxworks museum at the time of the murder and was never seen to leave. What connection is there between the musty waxworks and the exotic modern club? What happened to the silver keys belonging to the murdered girls?The Corpse in the Waxworks is by far the best Bencolin mystery that J.D. Carr has written."
2,Why?,Why was it necessary to let an overage hasbeen dominate more than half of a film with Jennifer Lopez?
1,Worthless crap!,"Itv had heard this movie was not much good, but I tried to watch it anyway. I could not stand it even for ten minutes. I would rather watch grass grow than to see this piece of junk. It kept pausing every few seconds."
5,What a movie,This movie is just fun. Lopez is great. I never was a Fonda fan but she was good too. Liked this movie a lot.
3,The writers were paying attention on this one,"Jane Fonda is well, Jane Fonda. I can't say I'm a huge Jane Fonda fan, but other than Barbarella, and They shoot horses don't they? I haven't seen a really bad Jane Fonda film. Her political views are not aligned with mine, but that doesn't mean she can't act.This was certainly not her finest role, or her best delivery, but she fit the role pretty well.The story line is pretty standard prince meets non-princess hollywood fare, but it's worth a view for some of the really imaginative scenes that the writers came up with."
1,Moster in law,I did not find this movie the least bit entertaining. I felt it was cheap comedey. I would of thought Jane Fonda would pick better scripts than this.
3,Jane Fonda's name Should Have Been on Top,"This is a Jane Fonda movie. Without her, this movie would have been typical Hollywood fodder. This not a movie that will challenge yourmind or make history. It's mindless entertainment, nothing more. The movie has some very good moments and it is mostly from Fonda. Could there have been a better Fonda comeback. Yes, but this is what she wanted. Lopez is fine. My wife found her weave to be distracting. (That's minor) Wanda Sykes should have been used more that just a Fonda sidekick. Overall 3 1/2 stars."
4,j-lo singer or actress?,"not being a big fan of j-lo (shes a better singer than actress) i found monster in law is one of j-lo's better efforts, jane fonda gets better with age and that michael vartan is so hot, the story is a little far fetched in parts but it a real mood lifter to all of us that have problems with our mothers-in-law"
2,chick flick...,"I fell asleep while watching this dvd. Jennifer Lopez meets her new future mother in law (Jane Fonda) and they don't like each other because mommy can't let go of her little boy. There were a couple funny spots, however they were few and far between. Has anyone ever noticed that for a singer JLO has an odd speaking voice? She sounds like a smirf on helium. If you have ovaries you'll like this movie, otherwise it sucks."
3,Not a monster of a comedy,"Monster In Law, which is about a prospective mother-in-law who is both evil and off her rocker, is worth a look.But all of the jokes seemed to fall flat somehow.You'll chuckle but you probably won't laugh out loud.The funniest character was the grandmother.This movie could have been hilarious with a better script.Even seeing Britney Spears (well, close enough) being strangled wasn't the moment it should have been :P"
3,Could have been great!,"The second half of this movie was really funny! It's too bad the first half was so dragged out, and there just weren't that many funny parts. Wanda Sykes was great in her role! Too bad she wasn't used more in the movie. It's a shame only half the movie is good, but the second half definitely makes it worth watching. I thought the second half was so good, that when it finally came to an end, I was disappointed it was over."
1,How Does This Happen?,"A movie like Monster-in-Law makes me ask: How? Why?How does a studio manage to convince Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez to participate in such a horrible movie? How does such a bad screenplay get approved? How does such an unfunny, uninspired movie get financed and made? Why would anyone with a modicum of talent and good taste make this? Why would they want their names attached to such a train wreck?Seriously, I want to know: How? Why?"
1,1 star of course,the good......the director will never make another movie.the bad.....the extremely bad is.....j-lo will.
4,Love Jane Fonda!,"The only reason I got this DVD was for the great Jane Fonda, I watched this movie when on board of the 'Queen Mary 2' sailing to London and I just loved how stunning Jane Fonda looks in every single escene, even when wearing the tangerine dress! I really don't care for Lopez as an actress."
1,Fullscreen only?,How is it that this movie is only available at Amazon in Fullscreen format? Is this a buying blunder or a product details misprint?
3,Average-Like 99% of the generic movies that comes out of Hollywood these days,"Average movie, average plot, average writing, average acting, boring, generic, and there is no way J.Lo is believable as a sweet, down-to-earth, girl (they did get the multiple jobs right!; her character has multiple). I am a fan of Jennifer, but for me she has become so famous that you just see her as herself, the brand, and not an actress and not the character. I think she should stop acting because she also just ""acts."" That means she's not acting from the heart, like Nicole Kidman. When I watch Ms. Kidman I feel her character. Jennifer is just saying the words, and screams when the script says scream, and tries to act cute (which is her usual persona in all her movies). That is not acting. I would say rent this movie because it's definitely nothing spectacular. For me it just got me through an hour in the day."
3,Disappointing,"I love Jennifer and Jane, but this movie really wasn't all that funny and was entirely too predictable. It just seemed rushed and fake. There wasn't much chemistry between Jennifer and her fiance or mother-son chemistry between Jane and her son. Glad that I watched it for free on HBO instead of paying money at the theatre or renting this dud.I am sure that there are much funnier movies out there dealing with the mother-in-law vs. daughter-in-law relationship."
1,Not Fonda Jane,"I wish I could give this ZERO stars (it wouldn't let me) because I don't need to see it, Jane Fonda is in it and that's enough for me to boycott it. How can any American watch anything with Jane Fonda after what she did to us in Vietnam? I for one will never forget! Go back to the rock you crawled out from under, Hanoi Jane."
3,this one's for the chicks,"we all know the typical story of meet my familly. its been used in ""Meet the parents"", ""Meet the Folkers"" and ""Gusse who?""its all about the guy wanting to marry the girls but is terrified of meeting the father, when he does meet the father, father doesnt like him. he ends up lying to the girl, girl doesnt like the guy, father helps guy, and they all live hapilly ever after. well i cant say that this is much of a difference, what i can say is that, this time there is a little twist. this time the girl is terriffied of meeting the mother.Jeniffer Lopez has proven to be a diva in all aspects of her carreer, so it is only fitting for her to play the lead role in this movie."
3,"Funny, but could have been so much more funny.","I found myself laughing at this movie and waited in anticipation on how the two main characters would get revenge on eachother......unfortunately everything seemed so toned down....there were so many opportunities to make more funny dream sequences, but we only got a couple. It should have been an outright comedy, and not try to be both a comedy and some sappy story.Overall, a good rent to get some chuckles. The ""air freshner"" joke is hilarious."
5,Great movie,I'm not a Jane Fonda fan; however I love Jennifer Lopez's comedic timing! The movie is full of laughs and surprises. I just had to add it to my collection. Highly recommmended.
4,Monster in Law,Movie buffs who love Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda will really like this movie. I truely like this movie.it is a great film.
4,Hysterically funny!,Great delivery of lines......Wanda Sykes stole the show!!! J-Lo is suprisingly funny herself and this is a great followup to Maid in Mahattan!
5,It's a keeper!,LOVE this movie and love the prices on Amazon for movies I love to watch over and over! It's so much more convenient than renting every time I want to see it. Love this one for a rainy/lazy day: )
5,I love JLO!!!,"I love this movie!! the movie is very funny, aggressive, and lovely. And the end was so romatic. Charlie and Kevin got married. Buy this!! You will love it!"
3,Not as good as it could have been...,"This movie started off with a lot of promise, and there are some great scenes throughout as the bride-to-be has to contend with her mother-in-law. However, much like 'Because I Said So', the story unravels to a lackluster and disappointing ending. All three actors do a fine job in their roles and there's a lot of great supporting actors, but great acting cannot help a poorly-written story. The end was cliched and cheesy, and I just couldn't stand it."
1,"BAD,BAD,BAD!","Being a world class Jennifer Lopez fan it pains me to say this, but this movie is terrible! I can only echo another reviewer and wonder how two major Hollywood stars can get talked into or talk themselves into doing something this bad. I gave it one star because you have to in order to do a review. The DVD package comes with two DVD's; the second being deleted scenes,outtakes, etc.. Watch this one and throw the movie away!"
1,Jane Fonda boycott,"Jane Fonda was a traitor in Vietnam and with one press release and no public apology wants everyone to forget about the past. I do think people can change and I defend the right for people to protest in the US but doing moral and welfare for people trying to kill US troops is inexcusable. Spend your money on a different bad movie that did not have to star someone who would rather encourage the death of US troops than protest the war in Vietnam.Disclaimer: I have not conducted a fact checked of the above personal comments, if she publicly apologized to 2 people in front of the press I still do not think she is sorry."
1,Brutal!,"This was ""Hanoi Jane's"" comeback? If that's so, she should have stuck with writing memoirs and making execise videos! This film was unfunny and absolutely brutal to watch. Jennifer Lopez was a complete disappointment. Wanda Sykes was wasted in a role that could have been hilarious. What the film could have used was a complete screenplay makeover. Neil Simon, where are you when we need you!"
4,Better than expected.,"I wasn't sure I wanted to even watch this movie but there was nothing else at the rental store so I succumbed. Well I was very surprised and pleased that I did as I really enjoyed the movie.True, Lopez's character is sort of up and down but Fonda's charcter was quite funny! On top of that she looked amazing! Lopez and Vartan lacked the chemestry but I like each in their own way and found the movie enjoyable in any case. Skykes is also hilarious, but then she always is and (for me at least) she and Fonda steal the show in this one."
2,Very cheap humor,I was very disappointed by this movie. It is boring. The person who wrote the script didn't really bother too much to think to make it interesting. Only cheap humor is used here and that's it.
1,The Flu was better,"ACTUAL STARS: zip. nadda.This movie is really bad. In fact during the movie I threw up a little. That was more enjoyable than this movie. While I don't expect much from Jane ""The Nazi"" Fonda I did expect more from Jennifer Lopez.Skip it. Get the flu instead."
1,Hanoi Jane - at her worst,"I despise Jane ""the traitor"" Fonda and everything she stands for. So, not only does she betray the country that provides her the lavish, elitist, leftist, liberal lifestyle that she enjoys, she can't make a funny movie - and never could. The term 'not funny' barely covers the scope of this stupid movie. It definitely joins the ranks of the movies that you will sit through thinking - ""Ok. I am going to laugh any minute now. It is supposed to be a comedy. I am going to laugh any minute now."" Don't waste your time, and don't give any money to one of the grandest traitors who this country has had the misfortune of knowing.This movie is NOT selling well here or in stores for two reasons. One - it's horrible. Two - the decent, good people of this country want nothing to do with somebody as evil as Hanoi Jane."
5,An Unexpected Surprise!,I am not a big Jennifer Lopez fan . . . I mean . . . I like her but I find her films unsatisfying. It's not her fault they usually give her scripts that start off good and fall short in the end. I think this film is an exception. I loved it from beginning to end. Jane Fonda is a wonderful actress and it is nice to see her back on the big screen. Not to mention she looks fantastic! Jane and Jennifer have great comic chemistry . . . and who knew J-LO could be so funny. I think she handles comedy well . . . would like to see her is more films of this type. The real scene stealer is Wanda Sikes. She is sooooo hilarious! I hope we see her in more films as well. There is also a nice cameo by Elaine Stritch . . . if your a theater fan you'll know who she is. So with all the great summer blockbuster of 2005 . . . I thought this was one of the better movies. I actually went to see it 4 times with different friends and was still laughing by the fourth round.
4,Good mindless fun,"Ok - this is not academy award material - but it is an entertaining, funny movie that speaks some 'truth' to those crazy mothers out there that make life difficult for the new daughters! Inexpensive and entertaining."
2,"Modern day ""screwball"" comedy falls flat !","I readily admit that Jane Fonda gave this film her absolute best, but sadly, even her best couldn't save it from being an embarrassing dud. My goodness, how does a comedy with a big budget and a great cast fail to generate any laughs or even a couple of happy, lightheated moments. Trust me, when you finish watching this film you will ask yourself "" did I just spend 90 minutes watching one exhausted cliche after another ?"" I want to emphasize the word EXHAUSTED because the cliches in this film are so tedious and unfunny in this day and age, they simply will not produce laughs anymore.....just many, many groans. If you decide to watch this film, just remeber I warned you. You'll not experience laughter, and your throat will be sore from groaning."
4,Wonderful Movie!,"This movie is wonderful! It makes me appreciate how well my future mother-in-law and myself get along! I took my fiance with me to go see this movie and he hates J-Lo, although, he did say it was a good movie! : ) Sykes was great! She kept the theater laughing the entire movie. Fonda and Lopez play off of eachother well throughout the entire movie. I do wish they would have developed the relationship between Lopez and the lead male a little more though. Overall- great!"
2,why watch despicable behavior?,"There's a line between slapstick and just plain cruel. Fonda's character's behavior just makes one cringe, not giggle. Not funny."
3,"Good storyline, poor acting!","I gave this movie 3 stars simply because the storyline and script was very good. However, the acting was a disappointment. There was absolutely zero chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Michael Varitan. I am a huge Varitan fan which is part of the reason I rented it. I really think they could have casted this movie much better. On the same token I think Jane Fonda played the perfect evil mother-in-law (even though, for the recored, I am not a Fonda fan.) Hopefully in the future movies will be cast according to talent and not according to who is the hot commodity of the moment."
1,Who cares about Miss Gordita and Hanoi Jane,"I think any movie with Hanoi Jane Fonda and Jennifer Hopez or J-HoHoHo as we purists call her deserves to be GOTCHAED out of existence! I don't like this movie, it is lame and stupid. Want a good come, funny movie watch the Tom Hanks/Dan Aykroyd version of Dragnet which is a classic! HEEGOTCHA!"
3,THE RETURN OF HANOI JANE,"Political preferences aside, one can't help but bask in the bravado performance of two time Oscar winner Jane Fonda in her first role in 15 years. As the titular character of this otherwise disposable farce, Fonda primps, leers and commands the screen as the possessive mother who tries to keep Jennifer Lopez from marrying her surgeon son. Fonda looks ravishing for someone approaching her seventies and she chews up the screen; one wishes she was even more used than she is. Lopez plays cute and feisty well, but she's no match for the seasoned Fonda. Michael Vartran as the man of both women's dreams, is bland; a better actor might have made his role a little more interesting. Wanda Sykes is fine in her Whoopi-like role of Fonda's acerbic assistant. There's little that goes on in this likeable farce that you wouldn't expect, but the fun comes in watching Jane at her comedic best."
1,flop after bomb after turkey after garbage........,"still she survives.how is this possible ?!?!?!?!lets go through her ''acting'' career(so many flops from 1 person should be a record)....not in any order but here goes --- enough,jersey girl,money train,anaconda,wedding planner,shall we dance,unfinished life,maid in manhattan,GIGLI ------ almost a dozen turds.i didnt see selena but how hard is it to lip synch?she played a spanish woman.she is a spanish woman.WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!u turn and out of sight were good movies NO THANKS TO HER.everything she touches disappears 2 weeks later.and to think,she has nerve to be making demands as to having her trailer all in white linen.god bless america,huh"
3,VERY disappointed!,"But maybe I was expecting too much. I thought this would make a great stop during a recent girls-night-out...we were all thoroughly disappointed, a few even offended! The storyline was so predictable. As with all Robert Luketic films, there is no shortage of cussing and of course the token gay character is there too. It could have been funnier, if anybody had cared."
4,funny,"Jane Fonda is a hoot in this movie. I liked the storyline. A great movie to see if you and your mother in law to be, are not in synch."
3,monster-in-law,movie had it's funny part's few and far between the black lady should have had more part's in the movie.
3,Formula Comedy,"You just know that J Fo is going to hate J. Lo and you are not disappointed. However, as talented both stars are Wanda Sykes walks away with this movie and is an absolute riot."
3,Were they spying on my life with my Mother in Law?,"It is the story of my husband, mother-in-law and myself. Sometimes I wondered if other people ever went thru what I did, and I guess there is an answer. This movie was a huge surprise, I am not a Jennifer Lopez fan, and have really not liked her last few movies. BUT this was a good movie. It is a cute movie that was entertaining, and made me laugh about the situation that I had been going thru with my husband's mom. He too, is an only child. This movie has some good moments, and others that you just kinda go.. Huh? But worth a rental!!"
3,Fluffy Fun for the Femmes,"In a nutshell, it was okay. Fluffy fun for the femmes. Don't know if I would call it a 'date movie,' because it didn't deal with the romantic relationship between Jennifer Lopez's character and whoever was the lead male in the movie. That relationship was established pretty quickly. The main thrust of the movie is the relationship between Lopez and (duh!) her future Mother-in-Law, played by Jane Fonda, who hasn't been in a theatrical release since 1990.I didn't think the movie wasn't as bad as Roger Ebert thought it was, but it wasn't good, either. It's the kind of film that I'll forget I ever saw in a couple of years, unless I run across this entry (which is kinda the point). On my movie scale, this rates a ""Sunday afternoon in syndication."""
2,Intimate Power,This could have been a great film if they had cast people who could act.Even F. Murray Abraham over did it.
2,not quite deliciously bad,"howlers aplenty, eunuchs and dwarves, lots of bad headgear, Maud Adams' cheekbones and overbite, F. Murray in all his F. Murray-ness and Amber O'Shea in all her OC-ness. And all that from the imagination of Prince Michael of Greece! Where is Maria Montez when we really need her?"
1,I want to see this movie again,"In 1990, Venezuelan billboards announced 'La Favorita' - a darkhaired, blue-eyed beauty in a harem. 4 of us Americans went to themovie (English with Spanish subtitles in Caracas). Something musthave gotten lost in the translation. The Venezolanos remainedserious, quiet, respectful throughout the film. We Americans couldnot keep from laughing at bad acting. Leaving the cinema, I had toapologize to the other three for suggesting the film. Ever since, Ihave wanted to re-watch this worst movie I have ever seen to determineif my first impression was right. I seriously want to see it again..... END"
