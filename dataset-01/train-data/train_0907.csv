3,"Good Book, But Outdated","This book isn't exactly graduate level, but it helps if you are. And even if you're not, you'll figure it out. Simply, you should own this book. Will you refer to it every day? Not likely, but it's one of the best 'general' studies of witchcraft out there, even if it is becoming somewhat outdated. But still a fantastic ""MUST OWN"" reference material! And despite the fact that it is getting a little outdated, Russell is an important scholar whose ideas you should be familiar with if you're considering any major research in this field. His work is still frequently sited and offers a solid basis to which you can refer to as your own understanding of the subject progresses. Buy it, read the sections that interest you, and keep it as a resource book. I bought it out of curiosity and ended up using it for an extensive paper on witchcraft. It served me well and will continue to do."
5,Dragon Takes its Time,"My wife and I completed this puzzle over the course of two weeks. The outline is very difficult with a white band that varies in depth. There are many similar colors but not as bad as ocean or sky! This is the second time we completed this puzzle and have agreed to wait on the ""Ice Dragon"" which is very similar. I consider this to be a higher level puzzle."
3,Long entertainment,"This is a very hard puzzle, but if you love puzzles like I do, you won't mind taking a long time to solve this one. It is very attractive after it is put together. But for the weekend puzzle person, this would be difficult to finish in a short amount of time."
4,Hard Puzzle,"This puzzle is difficult but fun. The colors are vibrant, so I can't wait to finish it. I haven't completed a puzzle in years so other, more puzzle-savvy people may not find this puzzle as difficult. I would recommend this product to people who have a lot of time or want a project that will last awhile."
2,Not the best,As stated before the picture is not crisp at all. usually I can see bits of the pictures in the puzzle pieces but with this one is a fuzzy mess. Also the puzzle isn't aligned correctly so in some places there is tons of white boarder and in others the picture is cut off. Not sure if I'll even try to finish this one.
1,Green Checked Valance,I tried to return this item but this company never responded to my request. Never again will I order from them. Cost is too high for a valance.
2,no edge,"This machete comes without an edge. You will have to grind or file an edge on it. As I am still working to put an edge on it, I do not know how well it works in practice."
3,We Care,"Janis put this book together while in her teenage incarnation. Some of the poems made it into lyrics, but in neither case can I make any sense of them. Alot of teen angst and anger comes through, to the point of being painful. Being as I adore Janis' talent, this book was painful to read. I'm glad she chose songwriting. However, with the talent and depth of her lyrics today, maybe she should try poetry again. It would be awesome."
1,I hate shopping for shoes online,"I bought the boots, they were to small at a size 13. With no return label provided, I shipped back the boots and requested an exchange to a larger size. I have yet to receive a credit on my credit card or the size 14 boots I requested to exchange for."
3,Decent straight to video horror movie,"Wholly derivative but somewhat effective horror thriller. Students visiting a secluded island to do field research find themselves the subject of a madman's obsession with movies. Considering the budgetary constraints the film is technically well done, the score fine, and the special effects mostly above par. Gore hounds will be pleased with the buckets of blood and a few unexpected twists and mild chuckles elevate what might have otherwise been a ho-hum affair. Who will live, who will die? Does it really matter? Recommended to horror affecianados."
3,Hack Indeed...,"I was very surprised by this one. It begins with your standard horror/slasher setup: group of college kids--and this group contains every cliche` you can think of--leaves to go do extra credit on an island out in the middle of nowhere, things begin to happen, and you'd think ""here we are again""--AND you'd be WRONG!I don't agree that the movie will have you ""guessing until the end"" (lord, if you can't figure out who's offing the kids, you need to turn in your horror membership card!), but I did enjoy the ending because...well, see for yourself! I think the title for this movie is very appropriate.The movie's running time is 100 minutes. It is rated R for some nudity and campy blood and violence. You know; you're STANDARD slasher movie! It is also crammed full of named actors appearing in cameos. I almost didn't recognize William Forsythe and Kane Hodder (former Jason Vorhees AND Victor Crowley of ""Hatchet"" fame) doesn't even receive a mention. Lots of fun. I recommend it."
4,Great product,I love this to tame my frizzy hair. It really works as a head wetter as it claims but it does not feel really heavy...you can use as a tamer with just a few spritz or if you use a lot it really leaves your hai wet looking without the mess of water.
3,Not Farberware,"These are the bargain bin, stepchild of Farberware. They look sleek and shiny, but the quality isn't at all what I expected. Probably good as a starter kit - but not if you do a lot of cooking."
3,A Good Piece Of Work,"Michelle has a distiguished voice who has similarities to Lorrie Morgan. Although she has some outstanding songs here, there is also some throw away material. The standout song here is ""What Love Looks Like"" which Michelle had a hand in writing. Other good songs here are ""Nobody's Girl"" and ""The Answer Is Yes"". But that is about it for the good stuff. The rest of the album is fair but with some throw away junk like ""Crank My Tractor"" which should have been thrown out altogether. Michelle has a lot of talent which shows on ""What Love Looks Like"" and proves that she has lots of potential to become big in Nashville."
5,Pray Without Ceasing,"What a delight it was to discover Mrs. Pfeiffer's lovely little gem of a book! She certainly gives us a wonderful example of being aware of God in our lives. So many times I have wasted all of that ""meditation"" time in my car, fuming and making lists of all I had to do and how late I was for doing it. Pfeiffer's, The View From My Car, has opened up a whole ""other"" mind set for me. She lives with God. With His help, remembering the lessons of this book, so shall I. Thank you for the eye-opener."
5,What is Hannah on?!,"Ive heard this song and seen the video. Rik has a very strong voice and covers this song superbly. Most songs written are influenced by the authors life. My personal opinion is that this is a brilliant cover, and the author should be honoured and proud that an artist who is essentially starting their career has choosen this powerful song as a follow up to his debut. Lets hope Rik continues to provide us with more songs like this."
1,He has no right,"Rik Waller has no right to release a song that was written by a man who sufferered the affects of racism, this song means so much to people around the world and should never have been re - released. How can he release a song that has such a strong impact on poeple when he has not experienced what Labi Siffre and the black race did during the apartheid and what many still do. Just because he is discriminated against because of his weight does not mean that he can release a song with such a strong and clear meaning. Who does he think he is?"
4,1066 and all that,"As always, an entertaining & jocular recounting of British history over the last five centuries.Reccomended for any wannabe student of English history!"
5,THIS CD DESERVES TEN STARS!,From Little Bitty to It's Time You Learned About Good-Bye every song is a gem.Sung by an artist that would even make a hit out of the most mediocre song. Truly the best cd I have ever bought!
1,Okay for beginners,"I felt duped after I bought this. There is nothing wrong with the software but any version of Windows Pro has IIS included free (you just have to configure it). Manasi's mastering windows.x series books tell you exactly how. I also bought php and mysql web development (welling & thomson) and it gave you explicit step by step instructions for PHP setup, Apache and Windows ISS. I also downloaded and set up Apache free and ran it on linux. I paid about $3 for the Apache unleashed book (wasn't really necessary because they include documentation). Save your money."
4,We've enjoyed this...,"and have even given it to a fellow aviator as well. It's great for weekend trips, although I'd still recommend asking around the FBO where you fuel or tie down. Some info was out of date, but overall it's a fun book to use!"
2,Hasn't been updated since 2007.,"Would have like it better if the book was more up to date. The website isn't really kept up much better since he won't allow dates on the comments.Regardless, this is still the standard for finding restaurants close to airports."
3,Call first,"We had an older version for years and was looking forward to a more reliable version. Well, we'd stopped at one and called another both have changed hands and were no longer recommended by the FBO. I know there are many more to try in this book, but we will call first.I do think it is a really fun concept, but I don't know how to keep it current."
4,The $100 Hamburger,"Very handy, found food service on or near airports I did not know about.Disappointed a little due the limited number of restraunts in CA.Othewise a good reference book for pilots."
3,Humourous and unrepentant,Basically Norman Iles takes the Rhyme and carol and asks what the original was really like. He takes the view that most of them have very ancient roots and have been cleaned up by sucessive generations of uninterested people.He introduces the Rhyme or Carol by printing it and it's variations and then disects it and represents it as his conjecture of the original. Often he reintroduces rhyme into the piece.It recreates some of the possible original pagan songs which had christianity superimposed on them.I borrowed it from the library but would very much enjoy a copy of my own
3,What is everyone thinking? Read this review before buying,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste."
4,Pretty much spot on,"It's been many years since I read this -- perhaps 35 or more. As a resident of the Bay Area 1969 - 1979, I had little to find wrong with this book -- and I tend to be critical when I know facts not presented -- when I read it. It really seemed to sum up what I felt and saw at those times, and added some aspects that I was unaware of. So while I might feel sadness or nostalgia if I read it today, I know it's a great picture window into the reality of the times."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought the car charger adapter for the All-Start mini-jumper because I lost the wall charger when we moved. Don't waste your time. This doesn't work. I loved the All-start jumper but if I had known that I wouldn't be able to buy replacement accessories, I never would have purchased it. Searched all over the internet to buy another charger. nothing. Also, allstartgroup.com is no longer valid. But another brand!!!"
1,Will not take a charge and Allstart has no customer Service!!,"I used this piece of junk one time. The next time I tried to use it, it did absolutely nothing. When I plug it into the wall it will not take a charge. So I went to allstart's website and emailed customer service and my email got returned. It's past the return period, so basically I'm stuck with a $65 paperweight."
4,Spare battery for remote locations.,"The Allstar Mini-Jumper 900 proved reliable and a worthwhile accessory on a recent trek to remote areas of Baja California. The Mini-jumper was able to deliver multiple jumps with little reduction in stored power. The standard booster-cable clamps were familiar and easy to use. The unit was also capable of charging travel accessories like cell phones, GPS, i-pods. The built-in light is an okay idea, however its weight prohibits its use. Its major problems would be weight followed size. While we were glad to have it, on a long trip where weight and space are at a premium, we would have looked at size more closely prior to selection. All criticism forgiven, once it bailed us out of trouble, now it's part of our permanent travel tool kit."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"I Never heard of this product but I can tell you that right out of the box it started my totally dead battery. I didn't even need to charge the product before I used it the first time. My car battery is still dead but I just keep using the ALLSTART AMJ-401 to start my car, I really need to take my car it in and replace the battery as it has been shot for over a year now and it wont hold a charge.(but the Mini-Jumper Jumpstarter still starts my Prius) I highly recommend this product. It also has some other neat features, I have been using to charge one of my old ipods too. It is small well built, neat and compact and very easy to handle and to use."
1,Keep Shopping.....,"Bought this several months ago.....of the five times I tried to use it, it worked twice. Just not enough power. I also misplaced the charging cord and there doesn't seem to be any way to contact the manufacturer....at least nothing valid on the 'Net. Certainly no Customer Service.....Amazon should quit selling these if they haven't already. Good idea poorly executed and no support."
3,Natives and Strangers,"I had to buy this book for one of my college classes, I didn't like the book that much But i needed it. and amazon had it."
3,New power concept,"The power principle is really a good book, however, it is very difficult in implementing and taking time. Examples in book are still not clear of how to live as a principled-center power. There are many inspring stories but do not clearly present what and how reader should live in the appropriate way.Good things are all ten principles of power which I totally agree that everyone should follow, however, if the author makes it more conclusion and separate sections to make reader more understand the logic of thinking, the book will be better than it is.By total, I will try to live in a principle-centered power life. And I love the book."
2,Moderate material for the faint hearted.,"Blaine's concept of power principle is interesting but it draws too much parallel to what S.Covey's message has been and offers little new. The opening chapters dragged on previous power principles, many of which an MBA student have learnt in Management 101. The various examples drawn are trying to hard to mirror S. Covey's real life issues and the content delivery tries to mimic Covey's 7 Habits' magic. I have a very difficult finishing it even thought I am a strong Covey enthusiasts."
2,Little information on practical inflential skills,"Interesting read at the beginning, but becomes rather boring and lack of solid substance towards the end. However the book contains a lot of interesting and inspiring metaphors which have saved the book from becoming a boring read.P."
4,"The more you listen, the better it gets","Read a review that said this was a great CD. Hmmm..this guy went to Texas A&M like I did. I think I'll buy it and see what it's like. Got it. Slammed it in the old CD player as I drove the 45 minutes to and from work for a week or so. First listen? Hmmm..some good stuff there. The more I listened, the better it got. If I had to categorize this guy's music, I'm not sure I could. But why bother? It's simply GOOD STUFF. He can rock. He can do country. He can go acoustic. It all sounds good. My favorite? ""Oh Rosie"". Other good'uns? ""Levelland"", ""Shades of Gray"", and ""Runnin' With the Night"" stand right up there with the best of Springsteen. What more can I say? Try it--you'll like it."
3,Good alternative country with folk rock feeling,"If you like folk rock or alternative country, I bet you'll find this album interesting. Robert Earl Keen may not be the name of everyone's lip but he sure delivers the goods from time to time just like Joe Ely, Jayhawks, Scott Miller, or Whiskeytown."
3,A bit too small!,"Although this is a beautiful comforter set with great quilting details and quality fabric, it was too small for my high profile king size bed. It left the mattress exposed on both sides. So, will return and continue looking."
5,I just love it but would like the plaid pillow shams,I'm so happy with the every thing I ordered I got two shower curtains and two valances to use as curtains .It all works out so beautifuly .I had already painted my room yellow and blue the colors are perfect and I have been looking for the right bedding and The Laura Ashley Emilie set it is a good match but to bad I can't find the plaid pillow shams . I did order 3 14 inch pillows in the plaid material so at least I have them .
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I have tried everything to find the plaid pillow shams to add to this collection and cannot locate them on any site. I'm so diappointed that I can't find them as I think it would really pull the whole look together with the plaid bedskirt. It's a lovely set and very well made but without the contrasting plaid shams, it just seems to be missing something."
2,Skip this one,"I am a big fan of David and Steve Gordon's work. Ever since Gate of the Sanctuary (later just renamed ""Sanctuary""), I have been hooked on their music. The first Garden of Serenity I actually wore out my copy and had to replace it. Garden of Serenity II was ok, it was a little more ""processed"" and less natural-sounding.This volume, unfortunately, I have no idea what the Gordon brothers were doing, but it it is not at all to the quality of every other work that I have listened to of their work. This has been a definite complaint among several new age store owners of my acquaintence. It was almost as if the Gordon Brothers put down a few tracks, gave it a lick and a promise and sent it off to be produced and distributed. This work is not up to par of most New Age Music of this type, particlarly from this duo whom I really expected great things from. It sounds completely amateurish."
2,Worst of the three,The first of the series is awesome. I'm a massage therapist and I put it on when I get a massage for myself. The second took some getting used to but it's O.K. - not as good as the first though. This third one is really dissapointing. Not particularly pleasant or relaxing in my view. Does not evoke any kind of garden I want to be relaxing in. I'm actually returning it. Make sure to listen to the samples before you buy - I made the mistake of assuming it would at least rival number II.
4,Useful for an elderly programmer,It is valuable to have a text with plenty of examples and good explanations. I think it could have a more comprehensive index.
5,Very Good.,I have 6 C or C++ reference books at my work desk. The two volumes by Bruce Eckel are the best.(Thinking in C++ and Practical Programming.) The print is large and readable. There are many examples. The explanations areclear. I give them 5 stars + .
3,Easy to digest morsels of SF trivia,"This book's format would be perfect as bedtime reading, that is, if you wanted to tell your children stories about the shady characters that helped shape San Francisco. I was disappointed that the stories (each of which only takes about 5-10 minutes to read) seem to only graze the surface of each person/event, but overall the book is a good introduction to the city and its colorful past."
3,Kind of disturbing,"The print has obviously been distorted so that Jesus' face appears elongated. The halo behind his head as been embellished beyond what it was in the original painting, which I've seen. Overall, it gives it a sort of creepy gothic art look, befitting an ancient cathedral. If that's your thing, then go for it."
3,See SuperFantastico,"The CD is great...I don't own it but, SuperFantastico has the same songs and in addition it has an extra CD for about the same price"
1,"REAL RED SOX FANS, DONT WASTE YOUR $$$$$","I waited for this movie to be released and was so upset with it. It is called red sox memories: the greatest moments in boston baseball history, and should be renamed The Greatest Moments of the 2007 season and other players. By the name I expected to see great segments on Yaz, Fisk, Clemens, Evans, Rice, Foxx, Boggs etc, instead you get every bit of the 2007 season and a tiny bit of history. Not enough time was spent on past greats. Also too much time spent on garciaparra. Good buy at $5 or less other than that STAY AWAY. A perfect pink hat movie!"
2,Poor production,"I agree with the other reviews in that there was too much footage of the 2004 and 2007 teams, which is directly pulled from other MLB DVDs. It doesn't seem to have a clear story line, the topics bounce all around. But the one thing that really stood out for me was that they would play the same footage AGAIN! There would be a scene shown early in the DVD and then they would show it again later on....why??? As if we didn't notice it the first time? This was very poorly produced, which is too bad because they did have some great vintage footage that could have made this a Red Sox fan must-have."
3,just ok,I was expecting the pieces to be higher quality....a lot of them were broken or cracked. They also curled when glued
3,Great book (Almost),"You would think in a book written about a language that has gone through as much of an evolution as VB has with .NET, that the book would contain more than 1 paragraph about printing. The same can be said about database access. Like Microsoft, they tell you how to do it with SQL, but your out of luck if you want to use an ODBC connected datasource. It took 4 hours on the internet to figure that one out. All in all its a good starting point and since VB doesn't even look like vb any more, this is a good book to get started with. Wait for release 2 though, its based on the released version of vb.net not the beta."
5,Another high quality and informative book from Wrox,"This book is in the same league as all the other Wrox Press books - high quality and very informative. Even though VB.NET is still in Beta 2 with the majority of features in place for the final version, this book does very well to explain whats new and how to migrate from VB6 to VB.NET. There are lots of examples in each of the many sections and the authors do an excellent job of explaining how things are different to VB6, what to watch out for and other good bits of advice. One assumption is made, and stated at the start of the book, and that is that you do have a firm grasp of VB6. Without it, you'll quickly get lost in this book and VB.NET in general. But if you have been using VB6 for a while, you'll sail though the 900+ pages and be well versed in VB.NET at the end of it."
2,Too many Cooks spoil the broth,14 Authors trying to write a book naturally leads to a lot of redundancy. The book is good in pieces but not really well organized. The Authors need to have a better coordination organizing the content. Not a good team work here. Let's hope that there's a better version coming up.
3,Not a very good book by Wrox's old standards,"I use to love Wrox books but they are getting sloppier and sloppier and weaker and weaker in the mad rush to be first to market. Don't get me wrong, this book isn't so much bad as just not very good. Topics that I expect to be in a professional level book (like printing) aren't there and often chapters stop just when they could have gotten to the professional level (the chapter on multithreading is a good example of this, no real discussion of deadlock or race conditions). I would actually say as a result of this the level of this book is actually beginner+ and not professional!I do believe this could have been a great book if it had another 3 months of development behind it, and I would be willing to bet the second edition of this book will be great and Wrox will recapture it's old glory. But, as of now this book is just half baked.(I also found the order of this book very strange, the core programming chapters on OOP are introduced in the middle?)"
2,Not professional level,"As others have mentioned it is easy to see that there were 14 different authors for this book. Some chapters were good, but most were not. If you have taken out all of the redundancies the book would have been 1/3 smaller. In many cases the book introduced the concept, gave 1 example and then quit - web services and threading. I expect more from a professional level book. In fact I would say this is maybe a beginner+ book. Also, several sections were just left out such as file handling.All in all this was a major disappointment."
4,Used as reference for study...,"Doesn's navigate too good, rather slow to use as a reference book for study. I have another electronic copy of the item that is more useful."
5,Very Good,It is just what I was looking for. I am reading it now and using it as a referance. Thanks
5,A Must Have.,I love having my kindle library at my fingertips. It makes it so easy to pick up where I left off.
3,Not great,"It took me awhile to figure out how to navigate around in the book, but since I already knew the book it finally worked out alright."
3,MORMANISUM,This gives you a good insite to the Morman religion. It does not take you into the highest level of the church but it still gives you a good feel for what it takes to be a Morman.
1,Next please...,"I found this book to be very man influenced and read nothing in its context to be spiritually fulfilling as the Holy Bible does. It reads more like a rule book of club regulations or a guide to a very controlled lifestyle. The part of multiple wives was rather interesting, in where you need the first wife's permission to marry, the new wife must be a virgin and the new wife cannot be married to another man, section 132 verse 61. This book also shares the same parallels to the Quran."
4,The Insidiousness of controlled media,"This book is an excellent insight on how all-pervasive state-controlled media can distort a person's better judgement into the state's required mindset.It is also contains a fascinating account of the wartime gliding scene. This is a graphic account of how it was possible to learn to fly in single seat aircraft, something that is never attempted today, and hints at the development of the modern wire launch.Recommended for WW2 history buffs and glider pilots alike."
4,Make your Living Trust,The book is great nd quite useful. It guides step by step to make decisions about the construction of your Living Trust; however you may need a lawyer to review your work. It is worth to read the book because you are ready and wiser to discuss the issues with your lawyer. The price was also right. Amazon charged shipment fees even after they advertise free shipment with the purchase of more than thirty dollars.
2,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT,"I found contradictory information in this self-help book, and the author was not helpful when I pointed out the discrepancies. Accordingly, I would not recomment this book to anyone."
1,Only for simple Trusts,"If you have and estate of more than $2 million or if you are in a second marriage and want to create a family trust as well as a marital trust, you are wasting your money on this book.I learned more in a 2 hour meeting with a trust officer than I did in this whole book."
3,Older Edition of book,"The book looks to be very valuable. My only issue is that this particular one is an old edition (#8 published in 2007). Edition #10 published in 2011 is in print. As laws change frequently, I recommend getting the other version with is also available from Amazon, although not Prime."
5,LOVE Nolo!!,"I'm always a fan of Nolo products because they explain hard subjects plainly for us non-lawyers. ""Living Trust"" is no exception. I haven't decided whether a will or a trust is best for my circumstances yet, but I have a MUCH clearer understanding of the possibilities thanks to this book. Very highly recommended!!!"
2,"Informative, but ""Plan Your Estate"" is a much better choice","The book explained a lot of things well, but almost nobody is going to make their own living trust with this book. Maybe single people with modest estates and no children.The book has many warnings: ""If you want to do blah, blah, blah, see a lawyer. Nolo's living trust program does not handle this situation.""I would give it 3 or 4 stars, except Nolo Press's ""Plan Your Estate"" is much more thorough. Better to get that."
4,Review of book,"I found this book very informative complete with forms. However, do not substitute this information for the advice of a good attorney. You should have an attorney set up your trust and administrate it when needed.Make Your Own Living Trust"
1,NO SUPPORT FOR THIS ITEM,"Tried to set up but wouldn't let me go past step three,( it would not let me set up any channels) called eleven differnt phone numbers for RCA with no one willing to help. Got frustrated and just sending the item back. If RCA is going to build and sell an item they should have someone within one to two calls who will help you set the unit up."
4,Great VCR/DVD Purchased,The item I purchased is what I expected. The item was in good working condition and did not took to long to arrive. I'm very satified with the VCR.
4,VCR Side Trouble DVD SIDE ALRIGHT,"Okay, I goot this thing in 2009. The VCR kinda erks me. The tracking doesn't adjust on some tapes. On some tapes the tracking does adjust. The audio is clear. I had to take of the VCR tape cover, because it wouldn't eject right and eat the tape. The DVD side. It is good. It reads DVDs fast. Finalizes them quickly. Picture is clear and the audio. So I give a DVD/VCR 4stars"
1,Would be 0 or minus if available,Pretty much the same as the other reviews. Locked up. Took it back to Wally World with a blank DVD and VHS tape inside cause it wouldn't let me retrieve them. When it did work the tape tracking would go crazy. This is a sorry product!!
1,Terrible,I did not buy through Amazon. But this recorder is terrible. Freezes many times during DVD recording. RCA passes you on to another company for assistance. Recording from VHS to DVD is poor quality. Pass this one by!
1,6 head VCR my a**,"I have never had a VCR that didn't work, I thought that technology had come further then this. The tracking is impossible to get set. In the middle of watching a tape, the tracking will go crazy. I am very disappointed with my purchase of this product. It is not user friendly at all."
4,RCA DRC8335 Unit ..,"The unit arrived late by UPS as they were not given our apartment number: we received the unit at their second attempt but it arrived without a handbook and with faults that stopped the remote control from being recognized by the unit. A series of emails between myself and the Amazon.com supplier created an RA (returns) number and I followed the instructions.The second unit arived complete with book, and after a brief learning curve I was able to set up the unit and I must say we are very happy with the result.Thank you for a system that does indeed do what it said in all ways: given a complete delivery to the right address - this is a good buy."
1,No Faith in This Product,"Bought this at Wal-mart, brought it home, hooked it up and it worked fine for two hours. After two hours the TV tuner goes out and it won't tune to any TV stations - analog or digital. I was very disappointed and upset. I did not even get a chance to test out the DVD and VCR recorders. I returned it and got my money back. After reading the other reviews, I believe I'll stay far away from trying to purchase another one."
1,RCA DVD/VCR COMBO 8335,Very difficult to set up. Must have TV on Video instead of Channel 3. Won't hold the correct time.
1,First Rate JUNK,"We bought this product a year and a half ago and we have had nothing but trouble with it. Customer Service is useless.It's latest trick is to eat my DVD's and refuse to give them back!! Had to take the entire case off and open the door manually to retrieve my disk, which by the was is brand new and one I really wanted to watch.The machine is stuck on Welcome, welcome, welcome..and will go no further. Not sure it's even worth bothering to try to have someone fix it.I will NEVER again buy an RCA product. What has happened to this wonderful company? If you don't want tons of headaches..leave this piece of junk on the shelf!!!"
1,VCR Terrible,"I excitedly bought this item (pretty well list price at WalMart) but when I finally got it all hooked up, the VCR was nearly non-funcional. The picture was shaky and would blip to blue screen intermittently. Although it seemed to record fine, it recorded what the VCR ouput was (shaky, blue screen, etc.). Seemed to me the tracking was off (no real way to fix this manually) in spite of (because of??) the six heads they advertise. The RCA people told me I needed to send it to them for replacement (my shipping costs). Needless to say, I it's not the DVD's that get burned, it's me."
2,"Good product, bad capacitors","This is a fantastic machine. Great picture quality, nice features, easy interface. My only complaint is that I've heard many, many people that have complained that these have died on them within about 6 months to a year of owning them. This problem is due to some cheap capacitors in the power supply. C226 is a cheap 470uF capacitor that you might as well replace as soon as you get this unit. It is probably going to start bulging and will result in an unresponsive machine. Cheap part - I fixed my DRC8335 for $1.30 (replaced this capacitor). If you get this, hopefully you know somebody who knows how to use a soldering iron..."
1,"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL, Negative 5 stars","This one is really really bad. I was shocked at how bad the VCR picture quality was. I have owned numerous brands of VCR's and I NEVER seen a picture this bad. The tuner picture is also bad and grainy. When I first turned on the unit, it locked up and I had to unplug it. I tried to record a DVD from a VHS tape and everything locked up after 2 minutes of recording. That was enough for me, I took it back for a refund. Also, there was a funny burning smell coming from the unit like something was overheating. Does RCA have chimpanzees doing all their electronic engineering? Avoid this junk at all costs. I wish Amazon had a way to give negative stars"
1,Refurbished?,RCA DRC8335 DVD Recorder & VCR Combo With Built-In TunerItem listed as refurbished. VHS recording poor. Copy VHS to DVD shut down in less than 3 minutes. Inserting VHS tape became harder and harder;won't seat properly. This unit not tested correctly! refurbishing was a lie!
1,Worst Product Ever,"Worked great for about 3 months - then stopped reading all DVD's. Tried cleaning the lens, tried unplugging it and resetting it. We let it sit unused for about 4 months, and now it still will not play DVD's. I either receive the message ""No Disc"" or ""Bad Disc"". These are regular DVD's that we have watched previously on this recorder. The VCR works okay, but everything seems to be fuzzy. Works more like a 2-Head VCR rather than a 6-Head VCR. RCA will not do anything about it - even though so many other people have experienced all of these problems and more. I will not buy any other RCA products and I do not recommend this product to anyone."
3,I'll be the oddball here.,"I got my RCA 8335 as a warranty replacement and not at Amazon.I must say my unit has performed well enough.I've recorded hundreds of programs with good results.Yes,the unit has frozen on me a few times but I just go through the ritual of -unplug and plug again and it goes back on track.I am sorry all these other people got bum units."
1,PURE junk,"Had mine just over 6 months. Ate a VHS tape (still can't get it out) and DVD operation is crappy. Clock will not stay set so timer recording is not reliable. What really irritates me is that if you try to go to RCA website for service info, it automatically switches to Audiovox site, and Audiovox will send you a message that they do not service this model"
1,AVOID THIS VCR/DVD RECORDER,"Save your money. This is the worst piece of A/V equipment I have ever purchased. There is a loud hiss that plays thru your speakers from both the dvd and the vcr player. The vcr player constantly 're-tracks' itself and sometimes even freezes. This happens about every 3 minutes of playing. This is my second one, the warranty was easy thru RCA, but why buy an item you keep having to return to the manufactor?? Plus, Thompson Group (RCA) has set up a seperate toll free number when you are calling with problems with this machine.Save your money. RCA is not the quality they were a few years ago."
1,It's Garbage,"Wish I'd read these reviews before buying this thing.I bought it several years ago, but figured I'd vent a bit now, as I'm playing with it again today.It never ever recorded a VCR tape to DVD, which is what I bought it for.I really dislike the problems I have negotiating through it to view a DVD. Makes me wish for the good ol' VCR days.After hooking up a new TV recently, the DVD's play in black and white only, but I figure thats a messed up connection problem. Or maybe directions that aren't clear enough for an old guy.Guess my main gripe today is the typically pitiful 'Customer Support' offered online. Since my RCA manual's troubleshooting section didnt deal with the color (lack of) problem, I figured I'd check online. Anyway, after going around and around several times, and filling in the same blocks over and over, I finally ended up getting to ask a question. Time will tell if/when I get a response. I can only imagine how unhelpful it will be."
1,Major Disappointment,"This text is for beginners only, with only the most rudimentary fitting information. It is packaged along with several pellon fabric basic slopers for fitting purposes."
2,Not recommended,"Yes the previous reviewers are right. Fabric slopers only usable by people who are RTW size US 8/ UK 12. And many much better books on fit.May be some use to fashion students using a misshapen standard size dress form.For anyone else, a very poor buy."
4,For fashion students,It's my understanding that this book is for students who are making their own patterns from SCRATCH. This way they start out with a perfect size eight sloper to make other patterns from.
3,Read the books...,"This is a video for the hardcore Doc fan who wants a complete collection. Ron Ely was good as Doc, but the rest of the cast left much to be desired. This was a campy take on the Doc legend."
4,Enjoyable as an alternate Doc Savage,"This movie may not be flattering to the Doc Savage that so many are fond of but it is enjoyable if you accept it for what it is...a sort of alternate Doc Savage, not quite the Doc of literary fame but a fun Doc Savage just the same. Sorry if this review posts twice but I mispelled literary the first time (silly me)."
4,Enjoyable as an alternate Doc Savage,"This movie may not be flattering to the Doc Savage that so many are fond of but it is enjoyable if you accept it for what it is...a sort of alternate Doc Savage, not quite the Doc of literaray fame but a fun Doc Savage just the same."
3,"Hookum but if you're a Savage Fan, it tides you over","Yes, there are better movies out there. This one is pure camp. As a fan of the good doctor for more than 30 years, I'm sad to report this is the only movie made about him. There is supposedly one in the works by ""Ar-nauld"" Schwartznegger, we'll see. But in the meantime, to kill some time and have a few good laughs watch this one."
3,?,I wanted a fun and fairly brain dead afternoon movie. I ahd seen this years ago and it filled the bill
3,john philip sousa - BIG mistake,"The film is campy, but honestly most of the camp comes from the ridiculous music selected for the movie. John Philip Sousa marches? Picture this with a competent score. (Hell, turn down the sound and play John Williams - Raiders of the Lost Ark soundtrack should do nicely.) Most of the film would stand up very well if not for the verdammt music. Nice to see it on DVD at last, albeit a mite pricey."
3,Doc Savage - The Man Of Bronze,"What starts out as a fine action movie slowly evolves into a campy fiasco. Ron Ely is excellent as Doc and I really didn't have a problem with the other cast members, especially since Laurence Luckenbill looks like Renny stepped out of the Lester Dent books! Its just that supension of disbelief is ruined when one of the villians is sleeping in gigantic cradle! Still, to date, it is the only representation of Savage on film and is all in all a good kid movie and if you love camp you will love this film!"
3,Doc Savage Man of Bronze,"You know...back in the seventies, this movie was really cool. It was campy, but that was part of its coolness...I had mercifully forgotten how obnoxious and ridiculous the villains were...I remember, back in the seventies, that my husband and I were really hoping for a sequel...Golly. I guess the moral is that you can't go back. Still like that piglet, though."
2,Movie was a disappointment for a true Doc fan,Was not true to the main people in the books made them more like a cartoon show than a real attempt at doing this moive right . Hollywood gives us what they think we want not what we want. Someday hopefully someone will do it right for us real Doc Savage fans. END
2,Only for people interested in anything about Doc Savage,This video is a campy take off of the Doc Savage character. It is similar to the Batman series in the 1960's. Those who truly enjoy reading the series will not be amused with the antics and truly bad acting of this show. I gave it a three because it had the Doc Savage character. END
2,Poor Doc,"Terrible...in concept and in execution and in casting (well, Ely was OK); Cutsey-poo here and there. No hint of what the Doc of the books was all about; no suspense; no elan; nothing. But, this is the usual outcome when Hollywood tries to bring superheroes to the screen...The Shadow (all special effects and a mish-mosh of themes and stories); The Phantom (Billy Zane good; Devil and Hero great, Treat Williams over-the -to ""performance"" ruins the picture along with the cutsey-poo asides and wisecracks not to mention the Ghost Dad to help out his often benighted son...The Phantom needs his dead dad to help him out with Diana? Evidently the writers never read the Phantom strips.)Superman I looks like they changed directors 1/2 way thru; The rest degenerated to the point that IV was a social message film; Batman I was decent, if you could accept Keaton..but, the next 2 were abominable, showing no one understood what made the first one decent. I could go on,but why bother??"
3,Too much jumping around...this is not a complete stand up show,"I love Dom...always have since i first saw him years ago. i thought this would be a complete stand-up show, but it is not. It jumps around with him doing one liners but there is no buildup so you might laugh...,or not. Doesn't do him justice."
5,God's Guidance Integrity Music's Scripture Memory Songs,"I love this CD! Many of the songs are just what I need at this point in my life and the tunes are uplifting. The songs don't drag; rather, they are lively and catchy and I'm always singing along and smiling. It's a great way to memorize God's Word."
2,It's ok,"It's pretty, but the clasp isn't staying that well on mine. I'm not in love with it, but it is pretty."
5,WHY BUY THE REAL THING...THIS BRACELET IS GORGEOUS!,"I have diamond tennis bracelets in white and yellow gold and this bracelet looks even better than the real thing. It sparkles beautifully, is well crafted and the price cannot be beat. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great tennis bracelet, this is the one. THANKS FOR MAKING QUALITY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT AFFORDABLE PRICES!!"
4,Very nice looking but be very careful with it.,"It looks great, my girlfriend thought it was real at first and loved it. Just be extremely careful with it because we were goffing around and it broke really easy. I fixed it myself under a magnifying glass and she is going to be more careful while wearing it. Definitly not for everyday usage."
3,Nice Bracelet but you must tighten the 2 figure 8 clasps,"This is a nice bracelet it's very shiny and so far pretty stable I've had it a couple of weeks and have never taken it off, but you do have to tighten the figure 8 clasp so that it has a secure grasp on the little bump. and that's why i gave it only 3 stars."
1,disappointed,I thougt the bracelet was pretty but the clasp was very cheaply made. It is very hard to get on and once you do clasp does not stay closed. A waste of money.
2,So-so bracelet.,"Super quick delivery but as far as it 'looking real' uhhh - no... I do however like the bracelet, just don't purchase thinking you will fool anyone into thinking it's gold and diamonds."
2,Tennis Bracelet,I bought this Bracelet for my wife she wore it one day and it broke at the clasp. Not very good quality. I would like to say though I sent it back and requisted a refund and was very satified that the company refunded my money no questions ask. I thank then for that.
5,"Beautiful, Delicate Piece",I bought this to add a little glamour to my days. It's not too much to wear during the day because it's delicate and small. It looks great with jeans and a t-shirt OR when you want to get dressed up. Have fun with it!
3,Beautiful bracelet--horrible clasp.,"This bracelet is absolutely beautiful--much more brilliant and striking than I expected! However, the clasp is horrible. The clasp came undone and the bracelet slipped off my girlfriend's wrist (unfortunately in a busy public area...) the day I gave it to her. It really was tragic.However, it was such a beautiful bracelet for such a great price, I think I might order a replacement for her, and then try to figure out how to make the clasp more reliable.This product would definitely get 5 stars if the clasp were better."
5,Awesome,i got this for my gf i expected it to be..about a middle range product but it turned out to be a very nice bracelet i was surprised esp. for the price. A great but i would recommend this item...
3,Nice for a Couple Times,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to worry about ""real"" jewelry at my wedding. It's a nice piece; however, one side of the clasp does not stay. I squeezed it a bit and it was better but it did not stay on all night ... after the pictures, I didn't care ... Still worth it for this type of wear. It would take minor adjustment to fix the clasp; however, we shouldn't have to fix something, no matter what the price."
3,Low fidelity,The quality of the recording is not very good despite the song being excellent. It sounds like it was recorded too loud or it was poor quality mp3 converted to a wav file. And I am listening to it through some very nice studio monitor speakers so I can really hear everything and it just doesn't sound right. It gets three stars for being a good song poorly recorded.
2,Nothing worth reading,"We bought this because we had twins and my wife is now a stay at home mom. She wanted to find some info that could help us out so we could make the transition a little easier. It was a big let down. We bought 2 of her books. They are pretty much the exact same book. So I fell like I lost out twice. So, if I was you I would go to a library and check it out. If you think that you want it then buy it. Also I have to say that the authors husband is a saint. I work a hard job that wears me out and there is no way I would come home and eat the stuff she says to make. Come on, not even a piece of chicken. Anyways, that's my opinion."
4,Saving money and living made easy.,I am a stay at home dad that thought this was an excellent book on how to survive on a one income household. It is possible by the helpful shopping advice and great recipes. It has easy to follow instructions on how to save and still enjoy life.
2,"Nothing new, but much missing","The general impression I got when reading this is that the author read The Tightwad Gazette, then decided that the info in those books was just way too ""cheap"". She repeatedly speaks of spendy ways as ""the good life"", and makes frugality out to be a hardship to be endured, and only to reach an important goal. The recipe section was very nice, as well as the resources listing in the back of the book. Overall, I would say save your money, and get The Tightwad Gazette instead. You'll get less biased information, and lots more tips for honestly saving money."
3,Good for those who are new to saving money,"I thought it was a good book, but more for those folks who are new to trying to pinch a penny. For us Stay at home moms that have been getting by all along, it didn't tell us much that we didn't already know. It did have a few homemade ""recipes"" for things we have to buy at the store, and that helps it overall. Really it is a book about using your common sense, but for those staring out it can be a real tool in saving money."
5,A must book for the one income family,If your thinking of being a one income family this a book you got to read and have. I highly recommend it. Because of her book we have been a one income family for about two yrs and we are extremely happy. Thanks Jonii Mccoy!
1,12th Miserly Guideline: Don't waste your money on this book,"I'd heard so much about this book (all good) that I went to considerable effort to get a copy. What a bitter disappointment it turned out to be. There are truly no new ideas in this book. She offers ideas such as ""pump your own gas"" and ""line dry your clothes"". If these ideas have not already occurred to you, then you aren't really trying, and you probably wouldn't look at this book anyway. There are certainly better books available. And Jonni McCoy is not a gifted writer."
3,Great Recipes--the rest so-so,"The recipes in this book are very good, and in many ways better than those in the Tightwad Gazette books, in that they are a lot closer to what the average family eats. And, all the recipes are in one place, you don't have to chase all over the book for them.That said, the rest of the book is not that remarkable--I would go in with a friend on this one, or borrow it from the library."
2,Not the best on the subject of frugal living,"Although I agree with the basic premise of this book, I didn't find anything new or unusual enough to warrant a recommendation. I found the grammar, diction and spelling mistakes downright distracting, and couldn't believe the chapter on babies didn't even offer one sentence on the biggest money-saver, breastfeeding. The Tightwad Gazette books are much more useful and creative."
2,DEFINITELY NOT FOR EVERYONE,"Honestly, when I purchased this book, I thought I would be given better and more original advice than ""shop at Goodwill and Salvation Army."" The author does include several good tips on saving on the grocery bill as well as providing several good websites that I was not familiar with...but overall I found this book to be depressing and impractical.If you must read this book either buy it used or borrow it from your local library."
3,"A good book to have on hand, but not a ""frugal best.""","Miserly Moms focuses mainly on food and supplies a good number of clever recipes. However, tortured grammer and some strange misspellings make the text occasionally difficult to read (for example, the author uses ""rue"" when she means ""roux""). Readers looking for a comprehensive guidebook to the frugal life might do better to go with ""The Complete Tightwad Gazette."""
3,Only so...so,"I don't really think this book gives much depth on the art of living on less. I would recommend The Tightwad Gazette if you want to learn to live on one income and look for this one at the library, there is really very little advice that isn't obvious."
2,inferior product quality,This LPA291 product was purchased for a set of LP bongos which fit nicely in the bag. The bag was of a light duty nylon with a bare minimum of padding. The zippers were light duty & delicate. Useage of the zipper caused it to jump off the track easily even while holding the track as straight as possible.
3,Ok for price,"Its ok for the price.Poorly packaged such that small screws, nuts etc were scattered throughout the box.Although very little assembly was required there was zero documentation of any kind."
3,What?,"How come everyone thinks this is the best Dire Straits albumyet? It's not the best. The songs are slow,like there are only a few songs that rock, plus one or two or3 weeak songs. I am a huge Dire Straits fan plus this album isnot ranked their best. Money for Nothing I think maybe the bestsong off the album beacuse it is a big big big hit. So Far Away,Walk of Life, & One World also rock. If you want the best DireStraits albums, skip this and go with On Every Street, DireStraits debut, Love over Gold, and the even better Making Movies."
2,4 very good songs,"Brothers In Arms, Your Latest Trick, The Man's Too Big, and (okay) So Far Away are great songs...especially Brothers. The rest is pretty bad. Get their first 3 albums. THOSE are great."
4,Their biggest seller.,"Dire Straits ""Brothers In Arms"" #1 (1985).Ex-Rockpile drummer Terry Williams joins the band. On this their 5th studio offering, ""Brothers In Arms"", is one of those albums that I really enjoyed when it was first released, but 27 years later, it has lost some luster. The big hit ""Money For Nothing"", was a fun listen in '85, but the years haven't been kind to this #1 smash. The songs I still enjoy are, ""So far Away"", #9 hot 100, #29 MSR, the keyboard driven ""Walk Of Life"", #7 hot 100 and #6 MSR, the mellow jazz-rock of ""Your Latest Trick"", ""Ride Across The River"", a different sounding Straits, very strong song. The acoustic-electric sounding ""The Man's Too Strong"", the gliding rocker ""One World"" and the smooth title track. They would wait another 6 years before releasing the drab ""On Every Street"", in 1991."
3,A good pop album,"Great pop album, with lots of well known songs.To me, the best one is the title track, really good emotional song."
4,Good Not Great,By no stretch of the imagination is this a bad album. Its just a little bit too commerical. Mark Knophler's guitar is not as present as in previous releases. The songs are still high quality. This disc actually rates 3 1/2 stars but halves don't count here.
5,One of THOSE albums.,"This album is a complete work of art. From the start it draws you into a world filled with vietnam hauntings kept at bay with uplifting swing melodies. My personal favorite is Ride Across the River, a melanchonic tune about freindship through the harshest of conditions, but most would know this by the song Money for Nothing which won the MTV Music Video Award for that year. Money for Nothing, as all the songs Dire Straits sings, contains that gruff working man attitude but what makes it great is the subtle meaning that is conveyed in the words and supported by the music. This album is a must for every music lovers collection. It is a record that you should listen to while nursing a beer in your backyard, staring at the diminishing sun, recovering from a hard day at work."
4,"Excellent Songs, Very Listenable","Easily Dire Straits' most ""listenable"" album - even when it's not art, it sounds good. I owned the LP first, so I find ""Why Worry"" about three minutes too long, and ""So Far Away"" drags as well, but even these problems are pretty minor. ""The Man's Too Strong"", ""Your Latest Trick"", ""Walk of Life"" and the ubiquitous ""Money for Nothing"" (which sounds so much better that it's not on the radio every hour) make for an excellent listening experience."
4,"Good, but mainstream","It's a great album, but the ecclectic songs of Knopfler's previous work that truly reflect his emotion are not here. He appears to be pleasing everybody, and that is probably why it is such a good seller. The guitar work is smooth, precise, and are otherwise perfect, but for real Knopfler, try their first self-titled album, Dire Straits or their more prog-rock album, Love over Gold."
5,Maravilhoso!,"Maravilhoso SACD!Chegou antes do previsto e em perfeitas condies.Recomendo a compra. Comprarei mais vezes com este vendedor.Atenciosamente,RonaldoBelo Horizonte, MG - Brasil"
5,remarkable time shifting adition,"The presence and quality of this seminal recording are present in this ""you are there"" recording!! A wonderful SACD reissue!!! I wish current artists would strive for such excellence!! I look forward for more seminal SACD recordings...new or reissue!!"
5,one of the best albums too.....but the most selling one...,"This album has everything the real rockmusic should have...and more.. Solid tracks, perfectly instrumental, and the lyrics too. Songs like ""Money For Nothing"" Brothers in Arms"" and "" Walk Of Life"" , is the biggest and best hits in this album, just this songs...beats many many other rockalbums by other artists. . And ""So Far Away"", ""Your Latest trick"", is also very very good on their ways...a little bit more slowly and, emotionell on their ways. and the other songs are also great too, after all. But not the most famuos on this album. ""One World"" are a very cool song , for example. All tracks is very intelligent and genius songs....on this album. 1985 best record. D.S is even best in everything too even the earlier years, whith the other albums... the true fact, nothing's wrong here... good bye, from a fan.....J.L"
5,A great album by a great band,"This is easily one of straits' best albums ever. Mark Knopfler's smooth guitar work really shines through. This album defines Dire Straits' later work. It's a great experience to get a good pair of headphones and listen to ""So Far Away"". This version of ""Walk of Life"" may be the best along with that on ""On the Night"""
5,Best rock recording I've ever heared.,"Far better than CD version. Focus of instruments and soundstage is outstanding, a real audiophile recording. A recording with warmth, a vinil-like sound. After hearing this SACD you'll want to through your CD version away."
2,Beware the Headband Years!,"I sensed trouble as I listened to all the noisy, obnoxious synths on ""Alchemy"". I knew no good would come from the Miami Vice fashions sported by the band in the ""Alchemy"" concert film. But I dumped the Straits after one spin of ""Brothers"". Tracks 1-5 (Side One, vinyl) just flat out suck. Where is the tight, groove-oriented playing? The Knopfler knack for good storytelling? Noticeable improvement on tracks 6-9 (Side Two, vinyl), but the Straits tank on the first half. Compared to the first four albums (self titled, Communique, Making Movies, Love Over Gold), ""Brothers"" is a lightweight, Mr. Mister-sounding stinkeroo. Some record label hack must have sent Mark and the boys into a panic on this one. They seemed to have lost faith in their instincts, and subverted their talent to achieve mass market stardom. Pity."
2,Not That Great,"You can't please all of the people all of the time, but if you try, this is what you end up sounding like - the aural equivelent of white bread. 'Money For Nothing' and 'So Far Away' are okay, but nothing special, and the rest of the album just annoys. It's a shame that Chris Rea gets lumped-in with this bunch. In comparison to Dire Strait's bread type, he's organic seven-grain."
2,Why Worry - The Weakest And Saddest DS Song Ever,"I'll say this is a bad CD because Why Worry is one of the saddestsongs I have ever heard saying ""Baby, i know this world has madeyou sad, some people can be bad"" and other sad parts, the endof that song is much better. The only good songs off this goddamn CD is probably the opener So Far Away with ""Here I am againin this mean old town"" Money for Nothing with ""I Want My MTV"",Walk of Life with ""Here comes Johnny singing oldies goldies bebop a lua baby what I say"" and Brothers in Arms with ""These miscovered mountains are only given for me"". Anyone who thinksthis is Dire Straits' only good album should listen to bad junkbands like Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, and AC/DC. Thanks."
2,Too 80's for me...,"The 1980's were a bad decade for music, and this album is a good example of why. I hope you like overly long, overly synth driven tunes that run out of inspiration shortly after they begin, because that's pretty much all you get. In fact, I can only think of two tunes worth salvaging here; Money for Nothing and the Man's Too Strong, which even then don't touch average works by great bands (the Beatles, the Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin, etc).A fine example of everything bad about this release is Why Worry, eight-plus minutes of boring...for one, you can barely hear it, but when you can it's fairly uninspired. The same can be said for the title track and especially the opener, So Far Away, which repeats the same line (not to mention measure) for about two minutes in the end, and the title track. I'd avoid it, but that's just me."
4,UNDERRATED AND DONT KNOW WHY?,"I just cant understand why people slam this great album.I am not a dire straits fan and only like theit debut and this album.rest of their cd's are quite bad as to me they soung like lounge music.Money for nothing has great songs in walk of life,title track and so far away.Ignore the recommendations of the reviewer called whirligig and get this with their debut whilst avoiding all their other remaining albums."
5,Makes You Think of 1985,"I was at a concert last night in Berkley, CA and at the GreekTheater, Mark Knopfler played all 4 of these classics, So FarAway, Money for Nothing, Walk of Life, & Brothers in Arms. Otherthan that, he played Telegraph Road. Very good. Anyway, this isa good album! Maybe a little not as good as either Making Movies,or Love over Gold. All these songs are pretty good!! I think theMoney for Nothing on here I think is done really well and I liketo repeat it over N' over again. Sometimes 3 when even better.Also, check out Your Last Trick, Why Worry, Ride Across the River, The Mans Too Strong, and One World."
3,Far from their best,"I know this is the album that really sent Dire Straits on their way to their greatest commercial success, but from someone who has been a Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan from the start I would rate this as pretty average, far from their best. Money for Nothing and Walk of Life are good but on the whole the album is not as strong as others such as their first album titled Dire Straits, Making Movies, Alchemy (live album) and Love Over Gold."
5,HDCD Encoded,"There isn't much to add about how great this CD was and is, however if you are wondering if the CD side is HDCD encoded, then the answer is YES for the DVD Audio / CD. I don't know if the SACD version is also HDCD Encoded.Hope this is useful for those with an HDCD CD player."
4,Why Is This Everyone's Favorite Dire Straits?,"The Man's Too Strong is actully one of the worst songs I have ever heard, and annoying. Other than that, I think it is prettygood though I don't get it why everyone likes this record so much. The best songs are So Far Away, Money For Nothing (that track really rocks you), & Walk Of Life. Those are the 3 of the opening songs on the album and they are brilliant and rock. I like Making Movies better, or Green Day even better Warning.But this is still really great. 4 stars because it contains only 1 bad song."
2,Not the best 5.1 sound I've heard,"I'm finding out the hard way that 5.1 surround sound is only as good as the sound engineer who mixed it. As I invest in older CD's that I enjoyed in stereo, I'm finding out that I'm not always satisfied with 5.1 surround mix. ""Brother's in Arms"" is a great Dire Straits CD. It could have been even better in 5.1 surround, but the man at the sound board dropped the ball. I expect to become engulfed in the music, with sound coming from all around. Hence the term ""Surround Sound"". Well, that didn't happen, and after the first 2 tracks, I got bummed and listened to something else.There is such a great opportunity to do something creative with surround sound, and that opportunity gets blown in the hands of the wrong person. I guess everyone has a different idea of what they expect to hear. In my opinion, Sting, Steely Dan, Bryan Ferry, (to name three) had their music mixed properly in 5.1 surround."
2,Don't believe them - it's not that great,"I like Dire Straits with their more laid back approach due to the singing and playing by Mark Knopfler, but listening to ""Brothers in arms"" is in the long run a rather boring experience. This album was in a way Dire Straits big breakthrough and includes the excellent ""Money for nothing"", and the catchy and happy ""Walk of life"". But the rest hasn't the quality I'm used to when it comes to Dire Straits.Skip this one, and go for their debut ""Dire Straits"" (1978) and the even better ""Making movies"" (1980) instead."
2,TWO GOOD SONGS,NOT GREAT JUST TWO GOOD SONGS ON THE WHOLE CD.I THINK WHEN YOU PAY ALOT FOR A CD IT NEEDS TO HAVE MORE THEN TWO GOOD SONGS ON IT... PAYED TO MUCH NOT HAPPY/////
1,ENOUGH OF THIS OVERPLAYED JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why do people like this so much? It is overplayed on every radio station in the world, and it is one of the worst albums of all time. Why Worry, & The Man's Too Strong makes this a rip-off. This, Communique, & Alchemy live is JUNK DIRE STRAITS and I don't recommend any of them.ps- overrated."
1,All I see in stores...what's the point?,"This is all I see in stores, this and Sultans Of Swing The Very Best Of. Are those 2 the most popular? Why is it? I know because people like Money For Nothing, & Walk Of Life, & overrated BROTHERS IN ARMS. Everything about Dire Straits is BROTHERS IN ARMS. What is the point? Why Worry, & THE MAN'S TOO STRONG ARE 2 OF ONE OF THE WORST SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD FROM 'Dire Straits'.HAHA! Thus, what is the radio always playing this? JUNK!!!!!!!!It Seems like you can get anything you want from the BEATLES, & the ROLLING STONES. But pop music is really weak. Try to get anything from Green Day or even Guns N Roses. They rock, and they are METAL!!! You can get any Dire Straits CD that rocks like the great ON EVERY STREET '''which contains HEAVY FUEL...the greatest song in history, a whole lot better thanoverrated songs like STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, or FREE BIRD.'''DON'T FOOL WITH ME!! HA"
3,"Good, but not their best","Commercially, ""Brothers in Arms"" is the most successful album of Dire Straits. Unfortunately, it isn't their best in the musical sense, seeing as they've added several enhancements to make their sound more modern or up-to-date (from an early 80's perspective, of course). Some of the album's best tracks include Walk of Life, So Far Away, Money for Nothing, Brothers in Arms and Your Latest Trick. Although Knopfler's talented songwriting and guitar playing are just as evident here, you'll be better off with their earlier albums to fully appreciate their style of music. ""Money for Nothing - the Best of Dire Straits"" which was released in 1989, will prove to be a good introduction."
2,overrated and i don't know why,"Why do people love this album from Dire Straits? I think the other 4 albums from Dire Straits are slightly better. And thisis not their top seller, either. So in my opinion, it's slightlyoverrated with several weak songs. Here are the good songs on this album. SO FAR AWAY, MONEY FOR NOTHING, and WALK OF LIFE.But I can't stand the rest of it as it's boring. This is a littleto 80's for me, I would like it if it wasn't their top seller and if LOVE OVER GOLD could be it. Get these albums insted...ONEVERY STREET, MAKING MOVIES, DIRE STRAITS DEBUT, and LOVE OVERGOLD. Thanks.....Whirligig."
3,Expected Better Sound,"I have a two channel setup, and I expected a better stereo sound. Don't get me wrong. It sounds as good as any other Dire Straits release. Mark Knopfler would never release something that is not up to his standards. I guess the 5.1 mix is the real star of the show, but there's no way for me to review it."
4,"""Brothers"" ruled the airwaves","Because ""Brother in Arms"" raised Dire Straits into international superstar status, it would be natural for longtime fans like me to hate it. But I don't because despite its popularity, it is no sellout. ""Money for Nothing"" and its MTV tie-in may have been the most overplayed song of 1986, but songs like ""So Far Away,"" ""Walk of Life"" and ""Why Worry"" are among leader MArk Knopfler's best ever. In fact, only a couple of draggy songs toward the end keep this album from obtaining true classic status. A rare example of artistic and comercial success going hand-in-hand."
1,"NOT the 1985 version if it says ""re-issued"" or ""remastered"":","BEWARE - Read the fine print. Even if it says 1985, if it also says ""re-issued"" or ""remastered,"" it is the horribly messed up version with all the life compressed out of it - for the ""loudness wars.""This is classic rock - really good stuff, but be sure to buy a used CD with the original mastering. The original is breathtaking in its clarity. Very quiet voices and instruments are clearly discernible. It is startling, actually. Not so in the remastered version. The re-mastered version might be better for jogging with an iPod, but if you are going to listen on a good stereo, the original is far superior. Turn up the volume."
5,One Of The Greatest Albums Ever Recorded,"An amazing album, truly. From the hard hitting yet humorus ""Money For Nothing,"" to the dark, melodic Viet Nam inspired ""Ride Across The River,"" this album pulls no punches. Be sure the check out the jazzy ""Your Latest Trick,"" with that soul stirring sax work. And, of course, the powerfully deep title track."
4,The Four Big Hits Of All Time!!!,"This is overall a pretty great CD for the big 4 even the most popular song, ""Money for Nothing"" which would be my favorite songon this CD. I love the riff on ""Brothers in Arms"" at the end! ""SoFar Away"" is a great album opener! ""Walk of Life"" is another classic that listeners liked after hearing ""Money for Nothing"".""Money for Nothing"" is a track that you can listen to over N' over again for sure, plus this version is even better than the single edit version. It is 8 minutes and 26 seconds that song lasts. If you are a fan to Dire Straits, then you must want this CD and buy it just for the 4. I also reccomend you these albums.ON EVERY STREETMAKING MOVIESLOVE OVER GOLDThese are my 3 favorite albums of all time!"
5,It's A Blessing to Be Loved By God...,If you want a good in dept understanding about the Book of Ephesians read the whole series. Just the first chapter alone will want you thirsting for more. This series has added to my spirituality a higher praise to our Father. A good bible study tool.
5,Good guidance,This book is a must for many who feel God is not hearing them. It is a good meditative and encouraging book. It will certainly make the read re-examine their motives for praying and seeking God's favor.
2,"Good for reference, not for learning.","I found this book effective for reviewing concepts I was already somewhat familiar with, but it was not very useful for learning concepts for the first time.Now that the class I used it for is over, I will probably keep the book and use it as a reference in the future."
1,Not a very student friendly book,I have read this book at most a dozen times. Still it is hard to understand most of the examples that are presented in this book. The explanations are short and superficial. This is defenitly not a good book for students. It is more like a brush-up of concepts for a math major which has mastered Discrete Mathematics. This Book is defenitely by far NOT for the Average student.
5,A journey-,"Unlike so many self-help books that are preachy and tedious to read, here you are lead through a heartbreaking yet wonderful fable of the black swan. It appealed to the child in me because it was told like a children's story. If you love being led, rather than being preached at, you will love this book. It's a real treasure."
4,Helpful,"I thought, when I first started reading this book, that it was a bit too simple a read for adults. Still, the opening situation with the girl was so familiar and even a little bit uncomfortable and I thought there must be something in here for me. There was! I think this book and it's lessons would be a comfort to most people who have been wounded in their childhoods."
5,Recommended for Everyone,"Susan Anderson beautifully utilizes the power of the fable in conveying complex concepts about life, love, and loss in this easy to read story about the Black Swan. Because this book is a story and reads like one it avoids the blandness and instructional nature of other selfhelp books. By the same token the story is not abstract or meandering. The principals and recovery methods presented in the book are clearly and concisely described so that they may be easily put into practice. Furthermore, the storyline helps to make sequence of the twelve steps or lessons easy to remember. I would recommend this book to everyone."
5,Cute little hoops,"These hoops are a little smaller than I expected, but they are cute and dainty. Good for everyday wear."
4,Sterling Silver CZ Earrings,"I love these earrings, they look really sparkly on. The only thing I would mention is that the first time I wore them one fell out of my ear. The post just needing adjusting to connect better. They came in a gorgeous Chinese style pink holder with a pop button which is really pretty and you can store more than just the earrings in there, so I would say it's ideal for a gift."
5,Casual or Dress!,"These are a great pair of small, comfortable earrings that can be worn with casual or dressy atire. The latch to hook and lock them together works very well and is one of the better designs I've seen and used. I've worn them a few times already and have had no problems with them. I wish I would have gone ahead and gotten 2 pairs (knowing the way I go through earrings). You can't go wrong with these, they are small, yet not too small."
5,Awesome!,I absolutely love these earrings! While I was wearing them I got compliments left and right. My only problem is that I lost one of the earrings...So now I am ready to buy another pair!!
5,Love the earrings,"I received my earring quickly, and I haven't taken them out yet. They are wonderful!"
5,Great earrings!,"These are really nice for the price!! I was not expecting something that looks as nice for everyday wear, and for such a low price, even if I were to lose one, I would miss the earrings more than what I spent!! Highly recommended for someone who wants a simple little hoop with a bit of sparkle."
3,Nothing special,"I expected this product to be a little better than what it is (based on the picture). However, nothing special in it. It is quite small and not that eye-catching. But compared to the price I shouldn't have expected more than this."
5,Cool Hoops,Really great quality for the price. The hinges are well made so I don't worry about them falling apart when I wear them. They are not white gold and diamonds. They are what they claim to be: Silver and CZ. I like them!!
5,Can't Go Wrong With CoolStyles.Com!!,"These earrings are beautiful! Very delicate tho, right when I received them I put them on and they broke! But that's ok because the wonderful seller (CoolStyles) said they would send me a new pair and sure enough in todays mail were my earrings!!! They look and sparkle just like real diamonds! And you cant beat the price for sterling silver, they actually look like white gold! So lets review....$8.99 for beautiful, sterling silver diamond look-a-likes, fast shipping, and GREAT sellers that go out of their way to make a customer happy! OH!! And they come in a very pretty satin zip pouch! HIGHLY RECOMMEND SELLER!! You cant go wrong!"
2,it's easy take out&#12289;,"I liked the earrings, looks good, but too easy to fall off an earring clasp is not tight, very bad, and the other fortunately"
2,Pretty but flawed,"I have had these for about a month. Worn about three times and the backings have bent to the point where it is now difficult to put them on. I have had many compliments about them and they are comfortable and nice looking, but I just don't think they will last long. I will only wear them on occassion at this point becasue I don't think they would last a whole week of use. Disappointed, but keeping them until I can afford the real thing."
1,bad.,"I dont recomend it, these earrings are small, and the clasp broke already, im not happy.pleas try to correct this product for customer satisfaction,thank you ,sincerely Patty Figueroa"
2,Very average,"The earrings are okay in finishing and craftsmanship, but the hook is not secure. I am going to lose one of them soon certainly and because of this I end up not wearing them often."
5,They look real!,"These earrings are a wonderful deal for the money. I can wear these earrings in my first hole, and my real 14kt white gold and diamond earrings in the second hole and they blend perfectly. That's what I call a good quality earring! Don't hesitate to buy, I'm picky and would not even write a review unless the item is outstanding. Buy with confidence :)"
2,Diamond Hoops,"I was shocked when I received these earrings. They are quite small -- more for a child than an adult. All in all, they are beautiful and my husband thought they were real! The price is right!"
2,Earrings are nice but BEWARE shipping charges!!,On this almost 9$ pair of earrings SecureHoop charged me 30$ for shipping! That is outragious!
2,Pretty while it lasted,"These came as described, and were great... For a few weeks. I used them for daily wear. Before long, the earrings would not stay clasped and the posts bent. Not worth the price, or the wait."
3,Very Nice/Sparkly Hoops In Beginning,"I did not think for the price I would receive such nice quality hoop earrings. Arrived quickly and very nice quality for sterling silver and nice cz quality as well. Will order again!! I love hoops that are not too big yet show up and make me shine : )Amazon always comes thru.UPDATE Aug. 8th...I already lost 1 earring. No, I will not re purchase. Disappointed as they were pretty in the beginning. Just not well made I guess. : ( Back to searching for a great, small and well made hoop with sparkle."
3,they are pretty but...,"so pretty but, the magnet on them wears out. such a shame. would love to wear the every day.otherwise they are fab!"
5,Essential Pumpkins purchase,"The 1979 EP was originally part of the Aeroplane Flies High box set, but if you're lucky enough to find it sold separately, go ahead and buy it. It has the classic ""1979"" plus five cuts that didn't make it onto Mellon Collie. ""Ugly,"" an ode to low self-esteem, has kind of a Cars sound to it, and it's one of the Pumpkins' most interesting tracks. ""The Boy"" and ""Believe"" are two poppier numbers written by James Iha (""Believe"" is my favorite of the two). The last song, ""Set the Ray to Jerry,"" is one of my favorite Pumpkins songs.This CD is fun to listen to. It showcases the Pumpkins' alternative pop side very well. If you see this in a used CD bin, don't hesitate for a second to buy it."
5,"Unique, beautiful arrangement","This CD is unique, and it is a reason in a good meaning.Vikki sings usual songs by different arrangement.I thought ""Hoy!"" to be the very good finish, and, however, ""Por Amor"" became quiet a little.The music that I like in this album most is ""Hasta Que Vuelvas"", and this is the introduction that was different from an original at all, but succeeds in a duet with Stephen M. Carrillo very much.""No Soy De Piedra"" is impressive music.In addition, because a photograph of the back side of a jacket was very good, this should have been considered to be a cover."
2,Disappointing,"Most of this book is about the effects of drinking bad water. Little is about the amazing habitats and animals the author experienced. There are some good points to the book, but they come mostly at the end when he finally uses his language skills to describe the wonders he's seeing, and gives his fellow traveling companions a break from being used to make himself appear clever."
2,Traveling for the Immature,Humor about vomit or bathroom issues gives this book a big stink. So does the ceasless scapegoating directed to the most inept fellow traveler. Better text is found in the author's interactions with wildlife and natives. Overall this book is like the primitive latrines it aptly describes - it stinks!
5,a fresh take on the fresh hell of travelling with other people,"Balows' keen ear for dialogue and wry perspective make Tales From Tanzania a must read for anyone who's ever (or, for that matter, never) travelled with a group of strangers. A highly entertaining account of the comic human safari."
2,Finally finished reading the book...,"I would give this book a 5 star if the title was ""Chronicle of The People and Events of My Trip in Tanzania"". The book is 70% about the author's conversation with his camp mates, about what goes on amongst them, about puking, and, last but not least, his imaginations. The amazing animals and habitats of Tanzania probably only takes up about 30%. Then again, the title didn't say anything about wildlife, I should have known.Some readers find him hilarious, but I find his jokes bordering on lameness and immaturity. If you're into the incredible wildlife of Africa, I highly recommend Peter Allison's ""Whatever You Do, Don't Run""."
3,"""Tall Tales""","Very funny but fairly accurate account of an American's experiences on a Safari in Tanzania.Could have done without some of his gastro-intentinal problems, which were described in painful detail, but enjoyed it anyway - was on a safari myself when I read it."
1,The worst book of it's kind,"I've read several books of this type and absolutely loved them. In this book, the humor is forced. I felt like he had a book af adjectives next to him to help him write. I had trouble getting through the book. He is truely ""the Ugly American"". I've travelled many times to all of the places in this book and was so disappointed in how he describes the places and mostly the people. I've traveled with Brits and had to go through the ""America Bashing"" which is nothing like his ""British Bashing--after the fact"". The only positive thing in the book was he spelled ""Maasai"" correctly. I won't buy another book about humorous trips in Africa, because I'd be afraid they would write like him. Instead, read ""Whatever You Do, Don't Run"". You'll love it. And--it's funny."
3,Cute Book,"This book is well-illustrated, very colorful and a good way to teach French. Be prepared though, it serves the same purpose as flashcards would with the words in each language - rather than a story.Perhaps the visual appeal of the pictures could also help the children learn the words, but I find it tedious to ""read"" so as to familiarize my little one with the words. I'd use this as a supplement to using the words in other ways rather than a teaching device in itself."
3,Style over substance,"I picked this up based on the the quote by Almodovar (who the author cowrote the screenplay Live Flesh) "" A facinating cross between Marguerite Duras and Jim Thompson"". Intrigued I decided to read it. Maybe it was the translation (translated from Spanish) but I did not see much of Duras or Thompson in this work. Closer in style to W. Burroughs. Tale of a travelling salesman peddeling a mind erasing drug and as audience we are left to piece together the fragments of our narrators own story which he himself does not remember from repeated use of his own product. Fans of non-linear storytelling might be more tolerant of this novel but I got bored and ploughed my way through the last third of the book.wish I had enjoyed this book more than I did."
4,"greatest""greatest hits""","i recently purchased this nice little german import,and what can i say it is better than the u.s. version wich i also have.it doesn't have any new songs but it does have most of their biggest hits and album tracks.the only reason i gave it 4 stars out of 5 is that it didn't include any songs off of ""caught in the game"" or their first album,but i have no other complaints.survivor was one of the best and underated bands of their era.i hope they release a new album someday, but until then this album should quench their ""survivor"" thirst."
3,good book but lousy illustrations,"this book was very interresting, but the illustrations on page 83 to page 95 were pathetic. I expected the entire book to be great, but then I saw those hand signals. The author shows hand signals by using stick figures, I believe that if someone were trying to learn the hand signals, they would have a hard time doing so. The illustrations should have been a bit more professional, if the author wanted to use illustrations, why not just use the hands, or even use a drawing of a full person with the hand movements. I expected more from this book. I am in law enforcement, and have had to use hand signals before, but would recommend that you read this for the information, but research the silent hand signals somewhere else."
5,legends of hip hop,"Ultra comes back after a lukewarm acceptance from fans from there ""funk your head up"" album.On the production tip each track hits hard and funky in the pocket. No recycled break beats or loops on this album. All the grooves are funk chops, brought to you by Ced-Gee, T.R. and Dj moe Love.on the lyrical tip Ultra is back on the space scientific abstract street flow!Kool keith is once again innovating on rhyme schems like on ""one two one two"" where he says each word twice over a funky track.Ced-Gee returns and gets ""superbionic"" on tunes like ""we are the horseman"" and ""bring it down to earth"" with an off beat flow that unicates every other syllable.As a whole this album is a classic return to true hip hop with dope beats and boasting and bragging rhymes that every true mc fan loves to hear.Peace!Marc Davis"
2,disappointed,I was expecting to get the classical text on meditation by the great master Kamalashila.This was a very technical text on how to meditate by someone who took that name.So it is confusing and disappointing.A good exercise in learning to deal with frustration?
4,Is it me or the authors?,"Lorenz and Cornelius have done an impressive job at explaining the diagnosis of many diseases starting with the more prevalent or important sign in the sick animal. This method is supposed to facilitate the clinical work of inexperienced veterinarians. It does not work well for me, though. I expected a sort of step by step guide (if the patient limps, you do this for these and these reasons; if it doesn't work you then do this for these other reasons; if it still doesn't work you now do this, etc.) but I found a not-too-well-organized discussion of a profusion of possibilities without much prioritation. It is confusing. It may be that the more the authors know the more difficult is to make it easy, or that modern medicine is overwhelming and there is not way to organize it better. But you can always hope!"
3,VERY BAD SERVICE,"item is good but your service was very very poor,,i mean customer service was very bad. i used gift card & credit card for both books together, not separately & then refund one book and u guys refund me gift card instead of putting it back to my credit card which is in your policies. this make me to pay credit card & have to use that gift card again. VERY VERY BAD & POOR SERVICE. CAN NEVER BE JUSTIFIED"
1,worst product ever,I got this because it had a list of awards it had won on the box. I installed it and now my computer keeps freezing on me and I have trouble getting online. I am going too get something else ASAP.
1,Make that zero stars,"Oh my goodness! *whew* This piece of, uh, software nearly destroyed my computer. I was easy enough to install, but it never really worked. It found one virus on my computer but would never do anything about it other than send a super super loud pig-squealing alert box up onto my screen once every minute (no exaggeration) letting me know it was there and that there was nothing that could be done. Then the really bad stuff started happenning. I wasn't able to click any actual buttons once I was online. I could enter addresses and view pages and such, but couldn't interract with any pages. Then I couldn't send messages on my IM. That was annoying. THEN I couldn't delete the danged software once I realized that is broke my life. :) It's all better now, but only because I'm wicked tricky. Someone of lesser skill would be up the proverbial creek. Stay far far away. It doesn't work and it's dangerous. Period."
1,My pot is peeling too,"I bought this months ago, but didn't use it until last week. 1st time I used the saucepan, the black caosting started peeling off."
1,Item not as listed,I bought this item solely because it mentioned that the product was by Farberware. It is not so. Silverstone is a brand by itself and not a Farberware product. I had to return the package and file for a refund. Pretty disappointing.
1,Stay away,"Not purchased here at Amazon, but warning others of this set as well. Same results that previous reviews pointed out, peeling of the metallic covering within weeks of use. In addition, they are quite flimsy and do not heat well at all."
3,"The putter is willing, but the cup is weak","Basically does what it says but with a couple of weaknesses:First, some putts which enter the unit stop without rolling into the middle cup, which means they are not returned and you have to go get your ball...Second, the return distance is not consistent. While you usually get a 10-foot return on commercial carpet, it is not unsual for it to only kick it out a few feet. Having the back of the unit against a wall or chair helps so all the force of the return mechanism goes into striking the ball. If not secured, some of the force actually moves the unit backwards a smidge (same principle as recoil when firing a gun).I'd pay another $10 if these issues were fixed, but still probably would buy this unit again...Remember, drive for show, putt for dough and you can practice putting in your office for free, but practicing drives is expensive and dangerous)."
4,My Dad Loves it.,"My Dad was reminising about his old ""Putt-Putt"" return the other month, so I looked on Amazon and found one just like it. He is lonely, my Mom passed away about a year ago, and this is perfect for him. Love it. It is pretty inexpensive, but works great. He likes the fact that you can be about 20 ft back and it will return the ball, no problem . (That is if you make it into the cup :))"
3,fair at least its not expensive,Its a good price. I bought it for my daughter to practice inside. Everything is ok but it pathetically returns the ball about a foot and a half. Not much worth plugging it in. Many years ago I used one that would easily send it 10 ft across the room. Get what you pay for I guess but overall not terrible
1,"Cheap product, don't buy!",The thing that shoots the ball out after doesn't work welll at all the ball goes maybe 2 feet! Buy something else!
2,great book...but this is the teeny tiny edition!,"Great stories, I love the book....but the size is teeny tiny, pretty hard to read as the type is so small. If I had known this, I would have gotten the 'normal' sized version."
3,Size a disappointment,"Should have read the description more carefully but thought from the price it was a larger book. Not appropriate for the child it was intended for. Content is wonderful, though. I kept it myself and bought another edition for giving."
3,print too small for a young reader,here again I asked for a young reader addition and you sent this that would need a magnifying glassI suppose the young boy will grow into it
3,Not gluten free.,"Even though when you search for ""gluten free spanish rice"" this item shows up, and when you check its ingredients posted on Amazon, the ingredient listing is wrong, and there is gluten in this product: hydrolyzed vegetable protein (corn, soy, wheat). Also, on the packaging it says, ""contains soy and wheat ingredients"".Don't get me wrong, it's a great product and tastes wonderful, but we had bought it for my wife with the expectation that she could eat it, since there is no wheat gluten in the ingredients listing, and sadly, that's not the case."
5,Money Well Spent,"I was surprised to see how this group did not catch on in the States. From South Africa, the music blends interesting beats and melodies for a distinctive sound. Simply put, this is one of my favorite CD's."
3,Traditional hymns with a contemporary feel,"I am a big fan of instrumental sacred music, especially hymns and am always looking for new additions to my library. This album was cheap so I decided to pick it up. I prefer very low key, calming music, and this album had a few tracks that I thought were particularly good. Most of the tracks were rather mediocre and uninspired, the arrangements included a wide variety of guitar sounds with some electronic guitars thrown in. It created a lot of texture to the album, but not a lot of depth."
1,"Awful, just awful!","Bad writing, cheap effects, bad acting, gratuitous sexuality, fight scenes that rival the 1960's ""Batman"" TV show for campiness: all the ingredients for a disaster. Ron Fitzgerald was especially cartoonish as the Bad Guy. He was supposed to scare and intimidate me with his evil and his power, and all I wanted to do was punch his silly face in front of his scantily clad amazon girlfriend (whose sole function was to desperately try to distract the audience from the incompetent job everyone did on this movie).I paid $2 for this movie. Having seen it; I wouldn't accept it as a gift.Thinking of buying this movie? Be bored! Be VERY bored!"
1,the dumbest movie ever,"I ordered this movie because I mistakenly thought it was the one based on John Fowles novel about an ESL teacher who runs into some weird adventures on a small Greek island.No such luck.It's a B-movie about a modern-day wizard, a renegade from his order called ""the Magus.""Lordy Lord! Terrible acting, inept directing, cack-handed editing, laughable special effects, and a script that seems like it was written by a 12-year-old.One can only hope that these filmmakers (and actors) never return to the business."
3,"Horror, martial arts and magic","This movie reminds me ofThe Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. Some people do have something ""extra"", but itis probably not magic. The so called 'dark arts' are a trap for thosewho think in evils terms of dominating others and becoming rich.It seems that all the really great good men have been poor?Here we are pleased that evil loses to the kindly elderly man.I don't think it is a coincidence that the Magus just got out of a psychiatric hospital?"
4,"Well written, not enough maps or graphics","If you like text, this book is for you. It flows well, is balanced and fairly easy to read, but if you like color, don't bother. It is black and white throughout. More maps would be helpful, as would graphical comparisons when listing out numbers and totals."
5,Very fast shipping and excellent condition,"I received the book in impeccable timing, and I peronsally think that the book is in better condition than advertised. Thank you so much!"
2,Cheap,At first they worked great very entertaing not the best for battles. In about 1 month the gold one began to fire as soon a I pulled the slide and not even touched the trigger. Dangerous! Soon enought the black ones slide snapped off as i pulled it back then it snapped in half. Good for starters not built to last more then a month.
3,live from the waldorf-astoria 1950-1954,This has some great music in it. I specifically purchased it as a choreographer and found it was not the best to choreography something for my specific purposes. I did enjoy listening to the music. It is all very similar.
1,Disappointing,"Product wasn't holding on well to the phone and made the phone even more cumbersome ...Sorry, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone ..."
4,Great!,"This case has already saved my phone once. It is easy to use, two pieces snap together right around the frame of the Nokia N73 phone. The case has gotten scratched up a bit but it's protecting the phone which is what it's supposed to do. $4.99 is cheap for the service it is providing."
2,Does not fit!!!,"Really dont thik anyone should buy this, was very happy to see that when my case arrived there were no broken parts n everything came as stated. Upon trying to fit it on it became apparent that it wud not fit, the case comes with 5 clips for fitting(3 on one side, 2 on the other) only 1 clip fits perfectly,and the others fit okay, 1 doesnt fit at all and cannot clasp, this 1 clip throws off the rest of the case makin it quite uncomfortable to work with. Do yourself a favor n do not by this, ur better off with a silicone case, like wat i am reverting to."

1,don't bother,I can't believe a paid 5.95 for this - this isn't an article. It should not be in any journal. Save your money!
3,Just okay....,"I am a solid intermediate exerciser, having worked out with the Firm a lot recently, but I found some of the moves confusing. Violet is not easy to follow, but she is pleasant, so she gets three stars for not being outright annoying. However, the participants looked really bored, and I was, too. Won't be doing this one again."
4,good muscle/cardio blend,"My only grievance is that I wish the workout was longer! Though it might not seem like there's a whole lot of cardio, you can accomplish a good bit in 30 min - it's all in how hard you push yourself. The instruction is good, the routines/intervals well designed, and by increasing the amount of weight you can really get your heartrate going. Perhaps there is not as much cardio challenge as I would like, so I combine this workout with another 30 min one. Definitely a worthwhile addition to your exercise library!"
5,Another great Crunch!,"I use exercise and dance DVD's almost every day, and have found that the Crunch series is the absolute best. The length of them is usually around 40-50 min., just the right amount of time for my workouts, and this one is as good as the rest. Instructions are clear, and this one lives up to the rest!"
2,You'd better be able to dance,"I'm not a very coordinated person, but I've had good luck with Crunch workouts in the past. After one minute I could no longer keep up with what they were doing. The choreography gets complicated pretty quick. If this is ok with you then buy the dvd. If you are clumsy like me, skip it."
2,Have good knees or prepare to suffer!,"I have tried several other Crunch video's in the past, and have loved them. This one, however, was a different story. The tape was very fast-paced, and the moves were difficult to get without being frusterated. I am sorry, but I don't love working out to begin with, and I do not need extra frusteration warding me away. I also noticed that there are several 'Jumping' moves that jarred my *young* knees to the point of pain. Maybe I do not have good 'jumping' form, however I do look to workout videos to set the user up for sucsess, not knee surgery!"
3,Not as good as Crunch Boot Camp,"This DVD was a good cardio/toning mix. Maybe I'm out of shape, but I do not find it too easy and work up a good sweat. The problem is I am not crazy about all of the funky balance moves and poses. If I want that, I'd do yoga. If you are looking for true strength training with the CRUNCH series, I recommend the Boot Camp over this one. But if you get tired of that one, this isn't too bad."
4,good,"Pleasant instructor, with an Ausie type accent (if your a guy and you like that kind of thing, she's also an attractive brunette) Not over powering workout. I do this work out regularly. The only thing I didn't like about it is that they call it ""Cardio sculpt"". Which is fine, but I didn't find much cardio in it, which was what I was really looking for. Have a light and a heavy set of weights for this, it makes it more challenging. (which she mentions in the begining)"
4,Good cardio with weights,"This is the only DVD of Violet Zaki I have. It works well when I want an ""all round"" workout but not over-working too many areas. You can always modify a workout, which Violet includes throughout this whole routine."
5,Crunch - Cardio sculpt: The body sculpting fat burner blast,I think this video is great!!! It is fast paced using various types of weights. After viewing it a couple of times I was able to follow the entire tape. You can really feel your muscles getting worked out to the fullest.
3,Hardly broke a sweat !,"As an advanced exerciser, i hardly broke a sweat when i tried this routine for the first time. This workout would be ideal for an intermediate or for an advanced exerciser who wants to go easy on one of those days. If you are looking for a kick a** 30 minute full body workout comprising aerobics and weights, try Crunch - bootcamp."
5,SUPER!,"I think this video is fabulous!!! You can really feel your muscles getting worked out to the fullest. You only need weighs and start moving!! At the end, you will be really sweating, but will want to do more!!!. The instructor and the music are really nice! You actually enjoy working out your whole body!"
3,"Difficult routine, set aside for now","To be fair, I haven't really given this DVD a chance. I tried it one time, and found it to be difficult to follow, as well as much more challenging than I wanted at this point. It has a lot of rather complex moves that need time (for me, at least) to learn and between the level of difficulty and my own personal level, I decided to concentrate on the Pilates cardio DVD I also purchased rather than a straight Cardio workout (actually, I purchased this thinking it WAS a Pilates-Cardio workout by mistake)."
1,Misleading,"Description states the product fits a 1995 BMW 318ti truck lid...Even did the Amazon verification to make sure the product was compatible with the vehicle. It verified it was. The product, however, doesn't fit...it was way too short. There seems to be a problem with the description and verification process. I now have to having to return the product at my expense despite being led to believe it was compatible with my vehicle."
1,everything wrong,it leaks water if you used the spokes for glasses. also had to put a board under it so it would drain properly. It has a very bad design that you have to set it up so it takes up alot of countertop. Got it for a christmas gift so i can't take it back. I guess i'll just have to wait til it starts to rust to get a new one and not hurt the person's feelings that have it to me.
1,More than annoying....,"I bought this KA Dish Rack and placed it properly edge over the sink. Yup, cup holders and the whole organization of the item was nonfunctional. I kept it anyway. I hate returning stuff. We had a very high end 20 year old dishwasher. Great machine but I kept finding water on the floor in front of it. I replaced it with a $900 KitchenAid dishwasher. As it turns out, it didn't leak, my dish rack leaked out the back. Who could guess there is a trough at both ends. I am totally rethinking the KA brand. My new KA dishwasher doesn't clean dishes. I was told it was because I clean them too much before putting them in. The dishwasher doesn't know what to do with clean dishes so it doesn't work efficiently. I asked the customer service rep...are you saying the soap has a mind of it's own? What do you think? GE?"
1,"Rusty, rusty, rusty! 3 months!","I've only had this thing for 3 months and, like other reviewers, my once-shiny chrome dish rack is rusty. It's probably 50% covered in rust, especially around the welded wire joints. I bought this at Costco, and it is going back. I thought it was stainless and would last at least as long as the plastic-coated racks. This is the worst rack I've ever seen."
1,RUST,What junk! I replaced my plastic rubbermaid rack that I had for many years thinking this would be an upgrade. Significant rust after just over a month of use! Unbelievable. Low quality materials - what are they thinking?
5,What Culture Has Done To You And How To Undo It,"This remarkable, possibly unique, and forgotten book would have the title of my review if it was published today. Read it and cure your ills, especially - but not exclusively - those whose effects you had not noticed. From emotions, thru thought and piles, to evolution and our poor, suffering body/brain."
4,Diamond Rio - Greatest Hits,"Diamond Rio is to me the best group in country music. Their perfect harmonies led by Marty Roe is capable of turning an average tune into a masterpiece.There are two previously unreleased cuts here. The spirited How Your Love Makes Me Feel, with punch-heavy chorus which became their second number one song six years after Meet In The Middle. The other new song, the Bryan White co-written composition, Imagine That, is the least satisfying song on this compilation.This set contains sone wonderful cuts like Norma Jean Riley, Mirror Mirror and In A Week Or Two. It also includes their radio-friendly songs, Holdin' and Walkin' Away but it shows that even with the weakest songs Diamond Rio still shines with talent and proficiency.If you are a Diamond Rio fan, don't miss this compilation. If this band is new to you, this collection is thorough and displays very well the reason for their successful career."
4,Great toons,"I really enjoy most of the hits on this CD, there are a few that I'm not crazy about but over all it's a great CD."
4,"Really good Collection,but...","...it could have been somewhat better.Just a little bit anyway.It includes almost all of Diamond Rio's earlier hits,but it's also missing a few too.""She Misses Him On Sunday The Most"" wasn't a hit.It wasn't even a single.I would've rather had ""Nowhere Bound"" on here instead of that song.""This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet"" and ""Finish What We Started"" should have also been included on here as well.Overall,this is still a great collection none the less.I recommend this along with their second volume."
2,One of country music's weaker Greatest Hits compilations ...........,"The lead singer's interpretations of songs are often second-rate, even though he has a great voice. The only track here where I think he nails it is ""She Misses Him On Sunday The Most""."
3,HITS,"I was not a big fan, I only knew a couple of songs. So this was a great buy for me. I have enjoyed it, and found I knew more of their songs than I thought."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,"This is one of the very few albums I own that I can listen to all the way through! This truly is their ""greatest hits"" and by listening to the album you can see why. This is definately a must-own for any Diamond Rio fan. Even if you're not a fan of Diamond Rio, you need to still listen to this album."
1,No Excuse!,"It's unforgivable to omit Diamond Rio's best song, ""Finish What We Started,"" from this album. Also missing are the hits ""This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet"" and ""Sawmill Road."""
1,Disappointing.,I've had this pan and the 8 in for a little over a year now. Just noticed the non stick surface is peeling off where the handle attaches to the pan. Was a lovely pan while it lasted. For the money I would expect better longevity.
4,Good Product,I have used this skillet for over 3 months and still in good condition. It is satisfactory for the price i paid. It also works well with my berghoff induction stove.
5,The Jazz Fly is a real Za-ba do-da roni!,I am a teacher in a 3/4 combo class of English Language Learners (native Spanish speakers). I also have 5 year old triplet girls at home. I was fortunate enough to see Matthew Gollub speaking at a teacher's convention and was really enthralled with his animated way of getting the audience in. I ended up buying three of his books. The Jazz Fly was a big hit with my own children. They loved the version I read (although I can't do it justice) and the version on the CD by Mr. Gollub. I can't wait to use this book in my classroom for my music unit!
5,One of the BEST!!!,"For anybody who loves to dance to highly addictive synths and beats, this song is a must. Featured on many different dance compilations (ie; Dance Party 2001, Ministry of Sound: The Annual 2001) this song it undeniably one of the best songs out there on the dance floors. Slowly starting with a nice synth, the song then rises into an outburst of the best dance music. A definite must for anybody..."
4,Cat dish,"It is gorgeous, good workmanship but too large for a cat dish. I purchased two of them ( different design) One I use for dry food for the cats, the other became dish for my dog. Way too large for wet food. It is perfect size for a dog, if you do have a small or medium size dogs."
5,fine,Fine. The aluminum is kind of thin and plastic might be even better (less likely to dent) but for only $5 (shipped) so what do you expect?There was a prominent bar code in the lower right corner; eh.
5,classic English language cookbook,Considered to be one of the finest English language Italian cookbooks published in the last 75 years. 200+ pages of both traditional and unique recipes.
5,Pleasures of Italian Cooking,"A friend of mine introduced me to this delightful cookbook. Because he enjoys cooking as much as I do, his mom gave him this book years ago. After looking through the recipies in this book, I decided I would try to find one for myself. First place I checked - Amazon.com. Thank you for an incredible addition to my collection of Italian cookbooks!! It just may be the best."
3,Not so good after all ...,"The book arrived promptly, and we really appreciated this part of the deal. The book itself, however, looks as if it was borrowed (most likely from a school classroom) and never returned. Its paperback covers have been plastified, which is nice, but makes the book look shabbier and older than it actually is."
4,They're all here. And they're not as hard as you think!,"I'm not very familiar with ""real"" French cookies, so I didn't know how hard or easy they'd be. It turns out that they'd probably have been a lot more work without this book. The author gives very clear line drawings exactly when they're most needed, tells you exactly what equipment you need up front, explains how to use the equipment you're probably not all that familiar with, and gives beautifully clear directions.The only troubles with the book is that some of the recipes are much longer to make than is clear from the first reading (the dough softens quicker than I expected, needs to chill 10 times, etc.), and it's basically impossible to plan in advance how long one of these batches will take to put together. An indicator of this would really have helped a lot.But they're SO good; it's amazing how much better cookies taste with just a little more time put into them and with a brilliant French chef's advice.Bon appetit!"
3,french cookie book,lots of recipes!! but again it could use a few more pictures. we learn alot by seeing the finished product
3,EXPECTED MORE,I bought this book expecting to learn how to improve my technique. To my disappointment it was mostly about the history of zumba and the creator. The video is very very short and very basic. If you go to a class and mimic the teacher you can learn more than what is in the book. I would only recommend this if you live somewhere where you can not get to a class.
1,DVD Was missing,"I was so disappointed when I finally got this product and the DVD was missing, but Amazon took care of me right away. Not sure how a book is going to help, hard to dance looking at pictures and reading a description. After reading the other reviews, which I should have before purchasing, I will purchase another ZUMBA DVD instead."
2,Gracias,"Elproducto es bueno lamentablemente sólo es el libro no contiene el DVD de ejercicios que según yo contenia ínicamente es un demo del lo que yo necesitaba, ahora tengo un libro...."
2,"Book was nice to read, But DVD misleading.","When I found this,I was so excited I couldn't wait to get it home and start doing my Zumba.To my surprise the DVD only showed 4 diffferent dance MOVES.There was NO WORKOUT at all!!!! I'm very DISAPPOINTED in it.I liked the book just for reading & recipes & menues,I wished I could have said something good about the DVD.Do NOT buy if your looking for a workout. :("
2,Book not a CD,"If I had wanted a book-it would have been fine-but I wanted a CD...I mistakenly ordered this item instead of a CD.It cost too much to return it, so it is sitting on my shelf. Thanks, Barbara"
3,not exactly what I thought it was,"Service was great. The product was not exactly what I thought it was but is satisfactory.[ZUMBA]Zumba by Perez, Beto(Author)Hardcover{Zumba: Ditch the Workout, Join the Party! the Zumba Weight Loss Program [With DVD]}01 09-2009"
1,Got the book but no dvd,I was so happy when I received what I thought was a book with the cd /dvd and i only recived the book. After reading all the other reviews I should have picked something different.
2,okay I am an idiot too!,Okay I am an idiot too. I totally was not expecting a book only. I punched in Zumba video got this. I need to read better. It does say on the book though that a video comes with it. You could put somewhere that the DVD is not included. I will read it though.
1,zumba book with vidot,I was disappointed was hoping this was a full vidio plus book vidio just a small demo i dont wont to read how to zumba workout i wantede mostly watch n learn
1,Not what I wanted,"I wanted the DVD and instead got a worthless book. When I contacted the seller, she said to bad read the fine print. It also came in an envelope barely held together by a couple of stickers. I am highly disappointed with this purchase. I will never buy from this seller again and would not recommend them to another buyer."
2,"DVD, what DVD?","If you're buying this for the book, great. If you're more interested in the DVD, as I was, you'd better try some other product. What the description fails to mention is that the DVD only offers a very brief tease or preview of what a full Zumba workout would be."
1,I'm glad I only checked this out at the library,"I was hoping the DVD would teach me some greatZumba moves....it has about 4-5 simple,simplemoves....waste of time, so glad I didn't purchaseit."
1,Scam,"Wow, the DVD is about 3 minutes long and teaches you a few extremely basic steps. This is not a workout DVD at all and you can't learn Zumba with a book. Who published this thing? I can't believe someone actually got this book published!!! It has convinced me to become an author and the first publishing house I will go to is the one that fell for this."
2,Not an instructional video,I should have read the description better. This is a book not an instructional video on a zumba class. It does come with a video but it is mostly music to use to teach a class. The book has good heath and eating tips but this is not what I was looking for.
3,Zumba Workout DVDs,"I was happy to recieve my Zumba DVDs and get started on the workout program, however, the very first DVD the 20 minute workout has a defect and won't play without freezing up. The rest of the DVDs seem to be just fine. Not sure how to get a new one but at least the others work. Maybe someday in the stores I will be able to get this DVD on it's own. I believe this is a manufacture error and no fault of packaging on Amazons behalf."
1,"Zumba: Ditch the Workout, join the Party.","I was very disappointed in this product. The DVD was just a short demo of a few basic Zumba steps. The routines must be learned from the book. There is just a ""sample"" of Zumba music on the DVD. I'm returning this item for a Zumba DVD I can do at home with routines that are visualized on the DVD. I would definitely have not purchased this item if I had known it was a book and a very limited DVD."
2,Just Words,The book may be a good read but it does nothing for working out. The disk has only a few moves don't really get you motivated. Now you have to buy the disk to start the program. not
2,Zumba,Didn't read ad closely enough and didn't realize that it was a book with a demo dvd. Wanted a DVD set
2,Disappointment book,"I wad disappointed first that it took almost a month to get the book. I have ordred many booksAnd this was by far the slowest shipping. The book wasn't what I thought your descriptioWas vague. The ""DVD"" that came with the book was nothing but a demo so nowIf I want to do zumba I have to either join a class or put out Morris money forZumba music not a happy camper"
1,Warning - False advertising - No workout DVD!,This is not a balanced review because I'm too upset. My daughters wanted a Zumba workout DVD for Christmas. I thought I was buying a basic Zumba workout DVD. I was totally surprised to find a book was delivered to my door. Even more surprised when my daughters said the DVD is nothing close to a workout video. We are all disappointed. Beto Inc. have certainly learned the techniques of crass and deceptive commercialism.
1,Misleading description,"The DVD in this set is not a ""fitness DVD"". It is simply a presentation of the very basic steps without any type of workout or routine presented. There is also a lot of peppy music, but no workout at all.All the workouts are in the book, but I found it impossible to visualize the movements from the photos provided. Really, can a person be expected to learn to dance from a book?If you want a visual introduction to Zumba, you will have to buy one of the videos in the series. This won't do it for you."
2,Zumba workout,"I am a big fan of Zumba but expected a follow along video of the 60 minutes music. The music is a gray screen with music and timer. Hard to follow and boring. If I knew this before, as the description was vague, I would not have purchased it."
1,i hate it,"this product is not what i expected, not helpful at all, a waste of money, i would defenetly not recomend it to anyone."
1,Zumba: Ditch the Workout,"Was not satisfied with this. It was not a workout video. It was instructions for Zumba and a book, so I refused it when it arrived. That was one of the options Amazon gave, but I still haven't had my account credited with the cost of the Zumba package that i returned, without opening.Too bad."
1,never received book,"It has been 1 month and I still don't have the book, so I can not give a review. I live at an fpo ap address so I'm not sure if that's the reason why."
2,Zumba book/cd,"I bought Zumba on line, though the book was informative I was disappointed with the CD, no where in the description did it say the CD was a short demo, this disappointed me, so I returned it."
1,Arrived without DVD,"When I ordered the book with an DVD I was so happy because I will be able to read also to watch the video,because when I read the product features said:Now the DVD and classes that have hooked millions are available in book format, with a complete workout program, fat-burning diet, and an exclusive instructional DVD with 60 minutes worth of music to help you Zumba your way to the perfect body.When my order arrived without of DVD also the cover is not the same>Immediate I contact amazon to return the item."
1,not what I expected,"I was so disappointed to receive a book and not a DVD. I browsed through the book hoping that it might still be savaged, but to no avail. It is better used as a textbook about Zumba than to actually do the workout. Very frustrating. It was terribly misrepresented."
1,DISAPPOINTED THE DVD IT SAYS IS INCLUDED IS NOT A WORKOUT,"Zumba: Ditch the Workout, Join the Party! The Zumba Weight Loss ProgramThere is a DVD included which I expected to be at least a short workout. Why people say ""it's a book"" I don't understand. Of course it's a book BUT IT SAYS VERY PLAINLY DVD INCLUDED. I'll probably give it to someone. I'm not buying a workout DVD for a WII or play station so I guess I will not do ZUMBA. It looks like it would be a fun way to lose weight or tone up but forget it. I'm very disappointed."
1,Misleading,I was under the impression that this was a workout dvd. It is not. Sorry I wasted my money. It wasn't worth to return it for the amount I paid for the book. The description on the listed item should read that the video is not a workout video. I was under the impression that it was an instructional introduction to Zumba with the workout.
3,Zumba BOOK?,"Don't know how I missed what I was actually buying, but I thought I was getting an exercise DVD and what I got was a book about exercising. The book has a lot of information on a diet and WRITTEN instructions for Zumba, but it wasn't at all what I thought I was buying, so I gave it three of five stars. I'm just not savvy enought to be able to learn how to Zumba by reading a book."
4,workout,Didn't make purchase for myself but it came in good condition and it looked ok. Not being used alot recently and might have been returned.
1,Very Misleading - read Carefully,"Like many others who wrote here, I too, thought this was a DVD workout video. I understood that it was a book but I thought the accompanying DVD was an actual workout video and not music so that after I read the book I can make up my own routine! Who wants to do that!!!! Really mad I bought this and I want to return it !!!!!!!"
1,mistake purchase,"this is a terrible product. Yes there is a book and yes there is a disk, but the disk only has few minute segments of zumba, not nearly enough to make the purchase worth it. There is more content about zumba on youtube.com."
2,The book isnt much good without the CD. That was the reason for my purchase.,I purchased this thinking the CD would come with it. I was dissapointed. I will be returning the book shortly.
2,"Zumba: Ditch the Workout, Join the Party! The Zumba Weight Loss Program","Wheb I searched out Zumba, this was listed. Since then better options are listed. I assumed it contained a DVD to learn Zumba, well it doesn't! I didn't find this product very helpful for what I was looking for."
4,Zumba,"I really like this DVD and was just disappointed that it was only a demo (very short). I tried to order another one and order was cancelled, so I may try ordering again, not sure."
1,Not worth the money,This book has some decent recipes but the video leaves a lot to be desired. I would not purchase this item again.
3,"Good diet, not so good video instruction","Diet is great way to eat healthier, but the 60 minute DVD is no workout at all. I would warn those purchasing the book that this is solely for the diet. Buy the DVDs if you want the workout, because the sample they give with this book is, well to be frank, a joke. I have heard great things about the DVDs though and would recommend them from that, but this book again is only a guide for eating."
1,not what I expected,Not at all what I expected. Just a book with a short video. Not at all what I wanted.
1,disappointed,"My fault I didn't realize it was a book, since I entered Zumba dvd's and this came up. The dvd included was clearly misrepresented on the cover of the book. This only show a few basic moves and IS NOT a workout dvd."
2,was not expecting primarily a cookbook and zumba instructions,I was disappointed since the DVD was more instructional. I know all the basic zumba moves and I only wanted the DVD to do routines during the cold and rainy days in my city. This DVD is more for new folks to the art of zumba. I will probably give this to someone else who is not familiar with Zumba for I felt it was wasted purchase. I wanted some lovely routines that would work up a sweat. Not so in this DVD.
3,worked great at first....,Ths product worked great for about 3 weeks. Now it will not open automatically after rewinding a tape as it should. It just stays in the machine making a grinding noise until you manually release it. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,lasted only a few months,"i ordered this for my mom to replace one of another brand that had broken (she had that one for several years). since she could not find it in any stores i came to her rescue and told her i could order one off amazon where you can find everything that i can't find elsewhere. right from the beginning it didn't work well, was very labored , also loud, sometimes it was not too bad. she figured she would keep it b/c it would have probably cost almost as much in shipping than to just replace it, plus just the hassle of returning something. last week it completely broke. i am ordering her another one(diifferent brand) hopefully she will have better luck...i would like to say that this is no reflection on amazon, which i love and have always had good luck with. just a lousy product i guess, i am glad that it wasn't more expensive or i would have tried to get her money back......"
3,it gets the job done,"I ordered 2 of these and both of them will rewind a tape and, thus, save wear and tear on your VCR. However, the item is supposed to ""open"" when rewinding is complete, but neither one did. So, I need to stay near and open the item manually to prevent burning the motor or breaking the tape. This is a minor inconvenience, but I thought it should be noted."
3,vhs rewinder,"Even though the machine is listed as magnovox, there is no such name on the machine. The machine preforms adequately."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"The automatic tape eject function went out only after one month of very light use. From reading the other reviews, it looks like this is a common problem. I've had the automatic tape eject function go out on other rewinders that I've had but only after a couple years of use, not one month. This unit failed way before it's supposed to. One reviewer stated that this was a minor inconvenience. In my opinion it's more than a minor inconvenience, it's dangerous, as another reviewer found out. If you're not there to manually eject the tape, the motor keeps on running which causes an overheating condition. I can't say for sure that this would cause an electrical fire but I sure wouldn't want to find out!!!I would stay away from this rewinder unless you have the time to stand there and watch the tape rewind."
3,Magnavox VCR tape rewinder,"The rewinder initially did not stop rewinding. For some unexplainable reason, it now stops! I had issues with the vendor which are still unresolved. So, I give this an average rating. It gets the job done."
3,As advertised,Recieved my merchandise as it was advertised . Good delivery time.Well pleased with the order and the service.
5,VCR Rewinders,"The Magnavox Rewinders are wonderful. They are ""Top of the Line"". My previous rewinders, were also Magnavox, and lasted along time. However, since DVD players are popular, VHS products, like rewinders, are hard to find now. Most stores don't even handle them anymore. So glad I was able to order them over the internet. Also delivered very promptly too. Thanks for a great product."
1,Very Unhappy with product,"I ordered the rewinder and it finally arrived 3 weeks later. I put my tapes in the rewinder, it rewound them so tight, now we no longer can use the tapes or watch anything on them. Now it is impossible to return the item or even have it fixed. Waste of Money"
1,Magnavox M61117 Vhs Rewinder,Have only used the unit about 5 times and it stopped opening automatically when rewinding was complete. You have to stand by the unit and open it yourself. Very disappointed that it did not last for more than 5 usages.
1,Do not buy this,I'm decorating my bedroom with frogs and outside things so I thought this would be perfect for my wall but it was very pixilated. I think I spelled that right. It was very fuzzy. I bought 5 of them and they were all the same. I sent them back. If you're going to see them from a far distance I guess it would be ok but my room isn't that big.
1,Never Received - Order Cancelled,"I have a hard time finding shoes to fit as I have a small foot. I was thrilled to see these shoes at Amazon and quickly ordered a pair (I already have a pair and they are so comfortable). After almost 2 months, I received a note that the order had been cancelled because they couldn't obtain the shoes. I was very disappointed. Plus I had ordered something else that qualified me for free shipping and I wasn't even given the opportunity to make that up. Very disappointed."
3,Good value,"So, we received the bench timely, and it did not take much assembly (initially we put the legs on backwards on accident which makes a big difference in the look! lol). As other reviewers have mentioned it is very dark, I would say black rather than dark brown. We decided to go with this bench because of the padding since my husband wanted something comfortable for guests to sit on. It does seem to have a lot of padding, but it does not seem overly comfortable, not much give when you sit down. Decent bench for the price, just wish it had a slightly more brown color to it."
5,LOVE THIS BENCH!,"Everything arrived on time, with no damage, and was so easy to put together. Once it was assembled, we loved it. The bench was bought to go at the foot of our bed to place the comforter on and we couldn't have been more pleased. This is the second item purchased from the seller and we've been happy with both purchases."
4,item in good condition,"Received the item in good condition. It is very comfortable and looks sturdy. My only qualm would be that one of the wooden braces underneath the bench is split, which hopefully will not affect its lifespan, and is probably not worth the hassle of return. It might be nice if the quality control were a wee bit tighter, but overall I'm satisfied, especially when the price I paid is taken into consideration."
5,Bench review,"The product is beautiful and just what I wanted!The only problem with the product, though, is that the manufacturer had split one of the bottom support pieces when screwing it together. As a result, the wood was split. I repaired it by inserting 3 cross screws, so it is lucky that I am handy with tools, and that I had to have it for Thanksgiving, so could not return it within the time frame needed.I must say, though, that the customer service was fantastic! Camelia Ward was assigned to my order, and called me, and emailed me to let me know the product had shipped. She was fantastic, and I must say, I will be happy to order from Visiondecor again, just based on her great customer service!"
4,Very pretty bench,"The bench is very attractive and a nice, dark espresso color. The leather looks real. It feels sturdy. It was easy to put together (simply screw in the legs). One of the legs was scratched/gouged deep enough to remove the finish down to the light wood. It wasn't big enough to warrant the hassle of a return; I just placed that leg against the wall."
1,Asperger's Syndrome,"Although this book is titled Parenting your Asperger's Child, do not be misled. This book does not explain how to parent a child with Asperger's. It merely tells stories about the parents and how they are coping, not the child. I thought it was a complete waste of money as it did not help me with raising a child with Asperger's."
1,"Categorize, medicate and ignore real issues","This book reads like a school psychologist wrote it whose goal is NOT to help our children but to make the child calm down for the teacher and the rest of the kids in class. It's not for parents, especially if you are not for medicating your child. I have read numerous books on Asperger's and this one is NOT on my list as a must see.Look for information that talks about WHY the child is having the behaviors or anticedents to behaviors and how to help the child DEAL with the behaviors: Tony Attwood, Carol Grey, Michelle Garcia Winner, and anything you can find on sensory isues which can be a HUGE reason for many of your child's symptoms. Anyone that TREATS THE BEHAVIOR is NOT TREATING THE CHILD but MAKING THEIR LIFE EASIER."
5,Parenting Your Asperger Child,Great book. Excellent reference. We need to order more copies so everyone at work has one of their own. Would recommend.
3,Not quite what I had envisioned.,I didn't realize it was primarily about how to write and sell h books. I am more interested in writing to sell for magazines. I bought it as a text for a homeschool course for my son. I can adapt the materials and make it work.
3,Typical Shirley Temple; and lots of fun,"Yes, her mom's dead, and she's taking care of dad. Yes, they go from riches to rags and back to riches again. And yes, everyone lives happily ever after. But don't you want a Temple film to be that way! And along the way are some really interesting turns and twists (besides the dance steps), like Shriley teaching a mama's boy to beat the other kids to the punch in a rather anti-Pygmalian side story; and some great laughs with a very young Eve Arden and a bunch of dogs in the kennel. Sound interesting? It is really quite unique and one of my favorites of the Shirley Temple collection."
2,Beware TV Version,"This is a good Temple film, and the transfer is nice. However, this is the version used on commerical TV about 15 years ago. There is a false fade out every 15 minutes or so where commericals were place. Why didn't Fox use a transfer from the mater tape? Other than that it's a goodbuy.One more gripe: Why do the Shirley Temple films come in pink boxes? Can us guys enjoy these films as well?"
3,Uncle Sam needs better packaging,"The product is about the size of a notebook cover and obviously not a high priority with the company that sells them. The product arrived late and was damaged (We're talking about multiple holes through the poster). Called the company, and they were REALLY good about being willing to replace the damaged product; I just wasn't willing to pay a total of $9.00 in shipping & handling for a $1.00 poster.You know, maybe the holes give it a measure of style that only a true musician could appreciate? Nah. It's damaged."
5,Amazing book,I think this book was outstanding. I loved the way Mr. Rosenblatt described eveything with such detail. I would definately recommend this book to anyone interested in euthenasia.
3,Men's Casual Flip Flops,Very well made flip flops but sizes run a little small. I bought a mens size 10 for my husband and the shoes ended up fitting me and I wear a womens size 9. Other than that no problem.
5,Like a Treasure Chest of Gold,"After buying many CDs of Mozart's Symphonies by various orchestras and conductors, I reluctantly went for broke and bought this complete set by Karl Bohm and the Berlin Philharmonic (having found Bohm and the Berlin Phil my favorite). What I discovered was that this boxed set contains 10 magnificent CDs. Outstanding. Superb. I ended up concluding that my purchase of this life's work, was dollar for dollar, the best thing I had ever purchased in my life. A treasure chest of gold for a tremendous value considering the Composer, Conductor and Orchestra. My absolute highest recommendation."
1,A sham and a shame - outdated and padded,"STAY AWAY! There's nothing 2006-2007 about this -- this is just ""Peterson's PCAT Success 2005"" repackaged. This so-called prep completely neglects the Quantitative Reasoning (math) section of the PCAT: its practice tests lack ANY calculus or pre-calc problems (50% of the 2006 PCAT's QR section!). Even if you're a math whiz who doesn't need any review, this book misrepresents the content of the 2006 PCAT.Also, the book contains only a handful of diagnostic tests and 2 practice PCATs -- the remaining 100 pages is a cursory guide to pharmacy school, info anyone planning to take the PCAT already knows. The only PCAT guide out now that even attempts to cover the material on the new PCAT is the (not so great) Kaplan's."
2,Same material as PCAT proff.,"I'm not sure if the authors of this book and PCATproffesor.com are the same folks, but the material is exactly the same. The ARCO book is basically 2 full tests, and both of those tests are on the web site. The material is good, but redundant. The web site also contains more review material, but you should only use it for a quick reference. The book is the more economical of the 2.I recommend the PCATprofessor, but I prefer to work on the computer. If you want something closer to the real test get the book, but not both."
3,it is not the best.. it is not enough,"only two exams one to know ur weakness points and the other after u improve ur self.. i think it is not enoughthe answers are detailed , however it is not enough to be a source.the rest of the book is wasting ur time talking about stuf related to pharmacy career ( why i'm taking PCAT when i dont know the career>>what a jock!!).i bought it becuase our professore recommended.. why?? i respected his opinion and brought this book.it is not bad, but it is not enough.. i bought audio cd beside it to revise.. now it is better."
2,This game is not popular with my 9 year old,"We just bought this game and want to warn others that the set up is just awful. You're guiding cars from the side, rather than from the back, so you can't see what direction to turn. My 9 year old who is fairly adept can't stand it. He also mentioned that he watched the advertisements for the Game Cube version of Cars, and it showed the race occurring from behind, so your POV is of the road ahead of you. So, I don't know what happened, but the Gameboy Advance SP game is an exercise in frustration for one child .... (He advised 2 stars for overall just because the subject was racing ... but I think the fun factor was in teh zero range based on his narrow-eyed demand of Can we return it?)"
3,fun but hard,i bought this game for my 4 yr old son..he didnt seam to like it much because it was to hard from..my husband said da same thing about it so he dont even play it..i in da other hand like it but it is hard for me too
1,Are you kinding me?,You call this a game.The graphicas are horrible the gameplay is so boring and there is no skill involed.All you do is hold down A then you go really really fast and bump your car into the walls and try to get to the finish line!I dont know what they where thinking when they said lets put this on the game shelfs. Dont get this game.Dont rent this game.Dont even consider this game.I give it a 1 star.
4,2 winners and a dog,"All three movies have terrific themes. One of them lags quite a bit in delivery style, but makes up for it in casting.Frankly, Tarantino relies on superb casting to carry ocassionally lame plot lines .. but pulls it off splendidly.In short, these are cult classics .. not Cinema Classics.Ya like them, or ya don't."
3,"Old information, Good format","I like the way the book is put together, but for a brand new book there shouldn't be nutrition information as old as 1983. You can find better then this. Keep looking."
2,A disappointment,"This book was a disappointment.I've enjoyed other books written by Stasheff and thought this would be a funny, light-hearted romp through technology with a bit of religion thrown in. And the prologue and first chapter or two were right up that line. Then it devolved into a series of mostly unrelated short stories that, with one exception, weren't very interesting (either standalone or in the context of the greater story). And the ""glue"" that held them together was repetitious and pretty boring -- this being the journey of St. Vidicon down the mouth of the beast and the ongoing relationship between Tony and Sandy. I did, however, like the final story where the alien conspiracy group took the TV studio hostage.Stasheff could have done so much more with this idea, and the book falls flat."
4,Dark and Sexy,"This is the type of album that you just put on, close your eyes, and space out. Dark but sexy. It has a real hypnotic influence. I've heard a lot of other albums try to be like this one - but fail miserably. Lilith is minimalism at time, yet always exciting and interesting... Very intro-spective... The first track is the highlight - and all 22 minutes offer something extraordinary..."
2,Are You Kidding?,This isn't a new album from them... its the same songs on their last albums... its kind of a joke how they remixed the same songs and then call it a new album. God I miss Rustic Overtones.... cause this sux.
5,Wonderful for speech delayed toddlers also!!!,My 2 1/2 year old was speech delayed but when I got Baby Babble 1 he loved it. It took him a couple more views to start to copy what they say or do but he has improved from how he used to be. He makes more consonants and vowels sounds. He's not quite saying sentences but at least we got a few words in. I plan to get the Baby Babble 2 to help him improve more with his language.
4,MY GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES IT!,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER WHO STILL IS NOT TALKING AT AGE 2. LOVE THE DVD BECAUSE IT IS VERY SLOW PACED, HOLDS HER ATTENTION, AND SEEMS TO BE HELPING HER TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH SIGN AND SOME SIMPLE WORDS. SHE MAY BE SLIGHTLY AUTISTIC AND HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED WITH HER VOCABULARY. SAW THIS DVD AND THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS. WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A 5 STAR REVIEW BUT NOT LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW FOR SURE. HOPE THIS TO BE HELPFUL TO OTHERS."
3,OK but overpriced,"I bought this video for my 11 month old, not because he is having any problems but rather to enhance what he is naturally developing in terms of speaking. I found the video Okay for him- he wasn't that interested. It was similar to a baby einstein video yet very cheaply made. The Speech pathologists come on the screen every once in awhile making vocal expressions which your child is supposed to imitate. The best part of the video is the quick parent tutorial going over signs and ways to enhance your childs speech (a quick segment at the end). Otherwise the actual part that your child is supposed to watch leaves something to be desired.I thought that this video was a good idea but poorly made. I probably would not buy it again even if they lowered the price. For those who are still interested in buying the video I would wait until it falls below $10."
5,My 20 month old loves this!!!!,"I bought this for my 17 month old and he still loves it. It seems corny, even cheap, but since he's been watching he has been making the sounds, faces and signs shown on the video. I highly recommend!"
4,Engaging,"I have a almost 3 year old son with Autism. He adores Baby Babble as it not only engages him but effectively conveys meanings, actions and nouns in context. Whilst it may not ""talk"" to all children, you can see the care and detail the two therapists have gone to make it meaningful. My six year old finds it a good tool for him to help his brother with his words. I wish they had done more DVDS as in my opinion they are just that little bit better than Baby BumbleBee's."
1,HORRIBLE!!! (coming from a mom of a child with autism),"I was looking for a video to help my son's speech delay. He has autism and is doing 20+ hours of therapy a week. I'm always looking for new ways to help increase his communication. He is 22 months old and hated this video (as did my husband and I). I have a speech therapist for my son and she laughed at this video. These two women do things you easily can (and I'm sure already are) doing with your child at home with toys and sounds. I can't believe they charge $15.00 for this home-made garbage! Their stoic faces and floating-like heads actually scared our son! If you want some great videos to help with speech and sign language, I highly recommend Signing Time."
1,Horrible!,"This dvd did not get my daughters attention at all! The other bad reviews were right, this dvd is outdated and just weird! I went against the bad reviews and decided to give it a try because of all the good ones and now I wish I had saved the $15. It is great for some I guess, just not for others. It is very slow and does look like a home recording, just like Baby Einstein which my daughter does not like either. Every baby is different but I would not recommend this dvd at all."
3,Close to Baby Einstein But Not Exactly,Some of the tips on speech development at the end of the DVD are excellent (and we have used them with some success). Otherwise the DVD is very similar to Baby Einstein but not as fun or cute. They should have stuck to their expertise and expanded the speech development segment.
4,good dvd,Good dvd for toddlers who are delayed in talking. it does sounds which my 22 month old repeats as the video is on.. I would recommend this dvd
5,My 18month old boy LOVE this movie!,"My little boy will watch this movie and repeat all the sounds! I believe we have just about every video like this to help get him talking, and this would be our first choice."
2,how good was this dvd?,"My child really didn't like the dvd, it didn't keep his attention at all. The dvd itself was short and didn't have alot of imformation which was repeated. My son is 2 1/2 and he didn't care for this dvd."
3,Mixed review,"As a speech language pathologist this video receives a mixed review. This video will keep your child entertained, but don't expect it to get your child to start talking. It resembles the Baby Einstein videos with demonstrations of oral motor excerises throughout the video. It is imperative that you interact with your child as you watch it and encourage imitation of the exercises. Simply viewing the video will do nothing unless you work with your child, which you are probably doing anyway if their speech is delayed. However, it is a good starting point for the parents with a delayed speaker and has some good tips at the end for parents."
2,Disappointing...,"I ordered this DVD on the recommendation of my child's doctor to help her with her late talking. Although it was modeled after the Baby Einstein videos but created by speech pathologists, I found it really disappointing.The quality is *lousy* and the music absmyal. My 18 month old was scared of the video at times and I think it had to do with the sound and music. The speech pathologist was somewhat severe during the demonstrations of the sign language and I found that offputting.We are much happier with the ""My Baby Can Talk"" videos and my daughter was much more responsive to them. The ""My Baby Can Talk"" videos is succeeds where this video fails and my daughter started doing some of the signs from it the second day of watching. I also found the parent information much more useful than the Baby Babble video."
4,Speech-Language Pathologist's Review,I am a Speech-Language Pathologist working with children ages birth to three with speech/language delays. I purchased this video as a therapy tool. I have given the video to most of my parents for review. I have found that it really reinforces the strategies that I am using during therapy. Baby Babble is different from other children's videos of this sort because it provides speech/language models to the display of toys instead of just playing music in the background. I have found that many of my clients have enjoyed the video and wanted to view it over and over! The parents report that their children were able to imitate many of the language models provided. I also enjoy that it provided signs to go along with the spoken words. This was especially helpful for those children who are not yet talking. I would recommend Baby Babble for infants/toddlers with or without speech-language delays.
5,excellent tool for late talkers,I have a 27 months old with mild to moderat hearing problem .She realy enjoyed this DVD and it helped her to pick up Ch and P words . it truly made a difference
5,WOW!,"We bought this after being told when my son was told he may have a speech delay. The first few months it caught his attention and he started to repeat objects then he started to repeat the sounds and words, now he at 22 months, he can use the words from the DVD in normal play when the DVD is not on! We only watch it a few times a month now. This is a great learning tool for any baby over 6 months old!!"
5,Worked for my son,"This video really works! My son is talking a little late and has some trouble with pronunciation as well. This video has my son making many new sounds and also saying a few new words. More than that, he is more interested in trying to say words even when he is not watching the video."
2,Not impressed,"Really low budget dvd...I can't believe this sells for $15! Its a really bad version of Baby Einstein. Maybe it does help with speech progression, I can't say for sure...if it does, I will be sure to come back and adjust my review."
2,Not sure how some kids like this,"I think this is the worst kids movie I've seen. I looks like a toy commerical to me. MAybe I'm the few who just don't get it. I have many others I would have thought to be bad but were great, this one just let me down."
3,DIDN'T REALLY HELP MY CHILD,"I bought this DVD about three months ago for my son, who at the time was 19m, and not talking at all. I watched the DVD all the time because I thought if he saw it a lot he would start to repeat the words. I would repeat the words as well thinking if I said it he might repeat it. After about a month I stopped watching it because he started to seem disinterested..... Well he is now 22 months and he hasn't watched the video in over two months and he's now started to talk. If I put our camera in front of him and tell him to say ""cheese"" he repeats ""cheese"". He says ""uh-oh"", ""dog"", ""hi"", and a few other words he wasn't saying three months ago... I don't think this video helped him. I think he's ready to talk now and that's basically all it was. He just wasn't ready before."
2,Baby Babble-Speech Enhancing DVD for babies and toddlers,"I didn't read the reviews before I bought this DVD, but I went back and read them later. I agree that it is not of the same quality as the Baby Einstein series. I thought it was a cheap rip-off of the Baby Einsteins. THe music and lighting could definitely be better. My one-year-old son did watch some parts with interest, but he looked confused or ignored it most of the time. I don't recommend the video, especially at the price."
1,my son is not interested at all,"Bought this DVD after reading good reviews, hoping to let my 18 month old son learn to speak faster. But my son just doesn't like it. In the DVD, just two women pronounce a few sounds and words when moving toys around. They may be language experts but how can my son learn from them if the DVD can't attract him.I actually found my son likes Disney's cartoons a lot. But there are hardly any clearly audible sounds in those cartoons. Can somebody make language enhancement DVDs based on Disney cartoon?"
1,not so great,It wasn't what I would have imagined and my 3 year old daughter wasn't very interested.
5,Great video that everyone should have,This is a very good video. I had read some of the reviews that were bad but ordered anyway and I am not disappointed. The ladys head is not floating around and the quality of the video was not bad at all. This video keeps my childs attention and he is already trying to make some of the sounds. The first time he watched the video he ran and got his toys that we had that were in the video. If your undecided about getting it dont be.
4,baby babble review,I bought this video after reading all the reviews on here for my 2 year old b/g twins. My son is more behind then my daughter in speech. This is a good starter video and they both love it and I have seen results. They actually have memorized most of the video and make all the sounds before they come on the video. I am planning on buying the second one. This is a great addition to any speech therapy that your child is getting.
3,I think this is for younger babies--around 1 year or so,"My daughter has a medical condition that may cause her to be slow to develop language skills, so I got this DVD, but she seemed pretty bored by it. She is 22 months old--I think I should have gotten it about a year ago for her. So, for her, I think it was a little too remedial and boring. I think it would be good for a younger baby though."
2,Not what I'd anticipated,"I was expecting much more given the generally positive reviews. I found this product to be over-priced for length of video and production quality. My 2-y-o son (who has autism) greatly prefers ""Signing Time"" DVDs to this one...and so does his mom."
1,The ages on this are incorrect,"I believe this video says for up to age 36 months. We purchased it around 30 months and my son was terribly bored with it. We sent it back. I'm honestly not sure how any kids would be interested in it, but we didn't let our little guy watch tv until he was 2 so maybe it appeals to younger kids? We had better luck reading Dr. Seuss to him."
2,"its ok, not worth 14.99","this is more of a instructional speech video for the parent. There is only one visual chapter for your child. I can't understand how so many other viewers said just by their child watching this, it immediately improved there vocabulary. This dvd is once again a teaching video FOR PARENTS."
1,My daughter never got interested in this.,"My daughter, as much as I tried, would not get into this DVD. She found this boring. I have to say I was pretty bored myself with this."
1,disappointed..,this dvd isnt what i expected from 2 pathologists.it isnt organized and of no substance.I am so disappointed.(sigh).
2,too little information for too much money,There is too little information in this DVD for the money.
1,DVD got corropted within 2 weeks time,I have purchased 'Baby Babble - Speech-Enhancing DVD for Babies and Toddlers' through Amazon.com. It was working fine at start but just within 2 weeks time it is now corrupted get stuck after a few minutes I am really unhappy about the quality. Its very bad.
4,she Love's it,"I am very impressed with the value of this DVD. My daughter's words were improving since we brought it home. I only wish it had more content, and a better soundtrack. We watch it from beginning to end (with her attention the whole time!) It's recommended for kids under 36 mo's. A great buy!"
4,Seems low budget but informative,"The quality of the this DVD is very low budget, that being said, it is very informative. There are great tips that you as a parent, will pick up on quickly and be able to use with your child daily. I've only watched this twice and already I find myself doing the exercises in the DVD with my baby during play. It's sure to get lots of smiles and giggles! ;D"
5,Saw improvements almost immediately,"My daughter is 2 and doesn't say much. Any words she has said she doesn't use consistently so it's easy to foget that she talks at all. She was a micro-preemie with understandable delays but after just a few days of these dvd's we noticed a significant increase in her ""talking"" and significant improvement with many more recognizeable words."
4,great for speach foundation,"great for starting words, sounds, proper vowels. good tips on helping language develope for parents. wish was a little longer."
3,Could have been so much more.,Amateurishly made leaving me wonder what they would have accomplished if it had been produced by Disney/Baby Einstein. Still it held my son's interest and gave me some ideas on how to work with my autistic son.
2,Very short,"It was written for children under 3 to 30 months. I wouldn't recommend it. Our 4 year old has slow speech, and saying ta pa da a e i o and u up and down.... isn't what i was expecting. It is clearly for kids under 1 year old."
5,Baby Babbles 1 & 2,"This dvd is absolutly amazing, now I know the so called experts say these video's don't work or help kids, but as a parent and having to live in the real world, and have actually seen my autistic son saying words with the video and dancing with the dancing bear, I can't tell you enough times how great these dvd's are. His vocabulary has trippled with the words he has learned from these dvd's. I have recommended them to several people and all have had great results. They won't do the work for you, you must re-enforce them with the Baby Babble book or flash cards but they really are wonderful tool to have. So I highly recommend them, and to those so called experts, maybe they should get out of the lab and have some children of there own. lol"
2,Baby Babble,I felt the video was very short and very cheaply made. My son did not have any interest in it. :(
4,Great DVD for engaging a toddler - encourages fun learning,"My mom is a speech pathologist, so when I bought this DVD for my toddler, I thought she would like it. This is one of the least annoying, most engaging DVDs I have found for him. He loves watching the toys on the screen and mimicking the sounds and facial expressions. We have had this DVD for about a month now, and I can confidently recommend it. I just wish it was longer, the Baby Babble part (not including all the commentary) is only about 20 minutes."
3,It's just OK,"After getting the 1st of My Baby Can Talk DVD's, I thought I'd try 1 from the Baby Babble Company, but this one is a bit disappointing. The production isn't as good and ultimately, my 7 month-old is not as interested or engaged as with the first CD."
4,Very Good Video,"My 2 y.o. really likes this video. Although it is similar to Baby Einstein, it keeps his attention a lot more and has helped him with his articulation issues. He has actually started using some of the signs he learned from the video."
2,Not quite what I was expecting,"Somewhat unprofessionally done- lots of shadows. It is sometimes hard to see what the speaker is signing due to the angle of the camera and the lighting.Many sequences are very very close- almost to the point of ripoff- to Baby Einstein videos. Same type toys, same bodiless hand doing the shape sorter, etc. only not as crisp or as well done as Baby Einstein.My baby is only 9 months old, so perhaps her interest in this video will increase, but I can say that she is incredibly interested in ""My Baby Can Talk"" which is a similar style sign language video."
5,Fantastic learning video!,"Although this video seems ""rustic"" compared to other videos on the market, my son probably learned more to help his speech delay from this video than any other. He absolutely loved it when we first got it many years ago and we recently purchased a replacement since the first was worn out!"
5,Helped my son with vowel sounds,"I have a 28-month-old son diagnosed with Childhood Apraxia of Speech. We attend speech therapysessions once or twice a week, and are making some slow but steady progress.I've played it once or twice a day for Kylefor the past two months. He voices along with the vowel sounds(aaaah-eeee-oooooh--oooo), and now does that around the house even when thevideo is not on. It really is very helpful to reinforce what's happening atour speech therapy sessions, and I think Kyle likes the fact that he nowanticipates what's coming. (His little brother, 3 months, likes it too.)"
2,Not for us,"I was excited for a speech enhancing program. But this one is not a good buy, as it's not for my baby. She is not speech delayed. She is rather speaking very well at 15 months. I wanted to make her speech stronger. I think that Einstein DVDs are much better and more fun. It's too boring and slow for her age. However, if I bought it at 3 months, I would have thought better of it because newborns enjoys quiet things like these more than toddlers. Anyway, i should be a good purchase if you have a speech delayed kid who likes watching quiet and boring videos lol. It's also OVERPRICED. I feel sorry for the money I paid for international shipping. :-s"
2,Not really worth the money,"I bought this dvd thinking it would enhance my 5 month old daughter's vocalization even though it seemed a bit expensive. She mostly just coos now with an occasional consonant. We had already begun signing for her since she was about 3 months old. I was really excited after reading all the reviews but this dvd just does not hold her attention at all. She would much rather watch her Brainy Baby video. I truly believe in signing to help babies communicate, though. I've seen it in action with my nieces. However, I recommend just getting a baby signs book and engaging in some conversation with your baby. Then, get a Brainy Baby video for entertainment. Please note that both were VERY cheaply made. It's just people manipulating toys to some background music. But at least the Brainy Baby allows me to get some housework done."
2,Poor,"Poor quality both visually and with the sound. The exercises are beneficial though, especially if you incorporate other objects around your house.This video is more useful if you interact with it rather than just leave the video on it's own. The facial expressions scared my son at first. I wish they had smiled more. I would really love this video if just a tad more effort had been put into the quality.I do recommend The Baby Society video. My son loved that!"
2,Best for babies under 8 mths.,"After introducing ""Baby Signing Time"" to my little one at the age of 4 months, this DVD was very slow and boring for her now at 12 mths. It's not very musical nor ""happy"" at all. Really very serious. The woman making the vocal noises (like the soung of a Fire Truck or just bu bu bu) never smiles and the DVD is by no means fun. Even the sign language is very seriouse with no smiles, laughter or music. In my opinion, NOT what babies need.Baby Signing Time with Rachel Coleman is absolutely full with songs and music while showing the signs and that makes it easy to keep babies attention. It's thanks to the Signing Time DVD's that at 12 months my little one signs over 20 signs, showing me what she thinks, wants and how she feels.In a nutshell...Buy Baby Signing Time instead!"
2,Don't believe the hype,After reading all the excellent reviews I purchased this for my 2yo son. His vocabulary is limited and I was looking for anything that could help. He was interested for about a minute and then went to play with his legos. The video quality is very poor and does nothing to hold a child's interest. Anyone could make this video with a camcorder and some colorful toys.Not impressed at all.
1,Dont Waste your money!!,"I usually dont write reviews but thought I would try to save others from wasting there money!!! This dvd stinks!! I dont see how making a stuffed animal make noise teaches kids anything. Like others have said the women are weird acting, and then it goes threw every toy they used and tells who the manufactor was. Very disappointed and I dont know how it had such good reviews."
5,Here's how to encourage your baby's speech,"My son has been watching this DVD since he was around 6 months. He is now 19 months old and many people comment on how many words he says. Unlike the Baby Einstein DVD's (which I think are great in moderation), Baby Babble is educational without being over-stimulating. Yet, it really keeps his interest as well. It teaches sounds and concepts, not just showing a bunch of things like flash cards. The first few signs he learned like ""eat, more, and all done"" were life-savers and cut down on a lot of frustration for my son. He has also learned a lot of objects as well as words to decribe things (up, on top, in, etc.) He likes to tell us little stories! For a toddler, I recommend Baby Einstein's Baby Wordsworth to expand his/her vocabulary of objects. But for a baby, Baby Babble is the place to start for understanding and communicating!"
3,Looking for something different I think.,"Not to say this is a bad DVD or anything, I was just wanting more from it. My child however REALLY enjoyed it. It held attention and piqued interest for sure.IT MIGHT BE helping too, as we've watched and practiced it four times now since receiving it this week and I have noticed more sounds and imitation coming from my child.Will give it some more time and perhaps I can make 3 stars - 4 or 5. I was just expecting something different than what I've already been doing at home.I would guess for the appropriate age group, the typical age group, this video will work a lot better."
5,Great for Apraxia,"My son has been diagnosed with Apraxia and I ordered this video hoping it would help. It seemed very dated, and incredibly boring to me. But, my son LOVES it. He imitates and talks along with the video. I am online today ordering the other 2 Baby Babble videos!! Great for initiating speech while entertaining young kiddos."
2,Daughter hates it!,"I understand the methods used in this DVD, but it is very simple and boring in my opinion. The biggest problem I have is my daughter just gets spooked out with the women in the DVD. She crys EVERY time she sees the women in some certain scenes. I do not mean to be rude or disrespectful to the women in this DVD. I am simply saying they scare my daughter. At first she started screaming when the one women appeared like a ghost out of nowhere with a black back ground on the screen making a weird humming noice. I ran into the room and played back what she had seen and could understand why. It was creepy in my opinion. I then put something else on and she was fine. One hour later is when I ran the test to see if the DVD is truly frightening her. Yes, they just spook her out. This is just not for my daughter. Again, no disrespect to the makers."
5,Must have for slow talkers,I was concerned when my son turned 19 months and hadn't really started talking. A friend suggested these tapes. By the 4th time he watched them he was repeating all the sounds on the video. Now at 22 months he is all of a sudden talking up a storm. I think he needed the basic sound building blocks that are taught in these videos (we have Baby Babble 2 also). I wish we would have gotten them sooner. Our second child now watches them too and is Babbling all the time at 7 months.
5,Speech,My son loves this video and will still watch it. I just purchase Baby babble 2 and I hope it will keep his attention as this video has.
2,Disappointing and frightened my 16-month old,"I bought this video in hopes of jumpstarting my 16-month old's speech. I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said the speech therapist was ""severe"" and somewhat ""scary"". She is. She wears a black turtleneck on a black background, so she looks like a floating head. But not a joyful floating head. A scary one that makes strange noises and facial expressions. It even made me uncomfortable. The production value also looked cheap compared to other DVDs like My Baby Can Talk. The lighting, color and art direction was bad. I had to turn off the video after five minutes because my child had this frightened look on her face and started to cling to me, and I don't blame her.The only reason why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I understand the value of it for speech delayed toddlers who may not be so sensitive, but beware if you child is the sensitive type."
1,OUTDATED AND ALMOST UNWATCHABLE,"I bought both Baby Babble and Brainy Baby because of the high reviews here on Amazon and I cant believe it was rated so high. My cousin recommended Baby Einstein, and I was ready to buy it here on Amazon, but when I read the reviews of Baby Babble and Brainy Baby I decided to go with this instead. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!Baby Babble arrived first and I couldn't wait to pop it in the DVD for my daughter. My wife and I watched Baby Babble together with our daughter and we were extremely disappointed. The toys used are outdated. The expressions used by the people in the video are so bland that they are almost scary (seriously)! I don't recommend this video to anyone.Brainy Baby however arrived later and we are pleased with this series."
2,Poor Quality,Good idea but the quality and presentation is poor in comparison to the other dvds my daughter has. I recommend My Baby Can Talk and Brainy Baby instead as they have vibrant images and pleasant presenters.
5,Very Engaging,"My little one has been watching this since he was 5 months old and he is now 8 months. He absolutely loves it. It's colorful and bright and keeps him very interested. He doesn't have any developmental issues that I'm aware of so far, I just read all the great reviews and decided to get it. My baby has never cared to watch any of the other DVD's his brother owns like Veggie Tales or Baby Einstein. However whenever I put this on he is immediately engaged. It has become a lifesaver when he gets really fussy. I can put this on and the fussing stops for the entire duration. I have to admit the first time we played it my husband and I found ourselves very much engaged ourselves. I really can't tell if it does anything for his speech development as he is still so young but I would much rather have him watch this than some of the other stuff that's out there for kids."
4,Great for THEM!,"My 13 month old (10 months adjusted age) preemie boys LOVE this video. They are really entertained by the sounds, faces and toys. It really seems to be one of their favorite things to watch. They were both slightly speech delayed and are learning sign language and have some speech therapy once a week. This video uses the strategies that they are learning in their speech therapy. Plus, it gives great ideas for parents to use with their kids. My ONLY complaint is that the dubbing is not great and the video can REALLY grind on your nerves as a parent. In fact, my husband (who works from home) can't be in the same room while it is on. But, the positives FAR outway the negatives and the boys really seem to like it. Highly recommended!"
1,CD Sucks,"Know What I Mean is an excellent song. However, if you are expecting songs like this on the album -LOOK AT- the rest of the cd is poor."
3,Mastering what?,"This is a good video for the beginner, but for someone that has shot guns for a while and is familiar with them, this video has little to offer. Much less, most of what is talked about is just basic techniques in using a firearm. This video does not get into details of the HK USP, he just uses one of the models during the video. He could have been using a Sig, a S&W or a Glock and most of the video would be the same. I have a full size HK, but Lenny Magill primarily uses the compact, which is a little bit different in design. I would not recommend for the true gun enthusist."
5,Excellent video,The sections on dry firing and imporving muscle memory are worth the price of the video. Practicing these each day made my range time much more productive - firing both faster and more accurately.
5,Awesome book,"This is an awesome book 104 pages of all Green Day. Being a huge Green Day fan I thouroughly enjoyed this book and didn't put it down until I finished. It's basically all about their lives and a biography of the band. It includes discography, tons of funny and awesome pictures from many concerts, award shows and just photo shoots. In the middle it has a whole section of coloured picturtes. Basically if you love Green Day you will love this book."
4,An Obsessed Fan's Opinion...,"This book is great for refrances and to learn the basics of Green Day's history.The layout and order is brilliant, the author has researched Green Day well, talking about the band's main inspirations and influences. The book contains a complete discography at the back and colour pictures in the middle, which are well set-out.The main downside to the book is the author's apparent lack of passion for Green Day. It's also written as if Green Day could do no wrong with its music. It calls the Waiting video a ""joyous, house-party themed video...and at the end, you just want to cheer"" when even Billie Joe said ""[our waiting video] was a total failure"".Overall, a good refrance book but for a more indepth, interesting read, I recomend 'Green Day: American Idiots and The New Punk Explosion' by Ben Myers.(this review was written by Aska, Clare's 14 year-old daughter)"
4,"Cool mix of Latin jazz, funk, soul & rock","One of East LA's hottest and most commerically successful Latin rock bands of the early 1970s, El Chicano fused rock, funk and jazz with deep latino roots, sounding at times like contemporary bands such as Santana and War, while also incorporating overtly jazz influences. On this 12-song disc alone, they covered songs by Tito Puente, Van Morrison, Ray Bryant, Herbie Hancock and -- I kid you not -- Wendy Waldman. The band's eclecticism was backed by a strong musical base, and these tunes are uniformly strong. This is a nice summary of their career, and a good example of the amazing creative ferment of the time. Recommended!"
5,El Chicano CD,This CD is great! I've listened to El Chicano from way back and it brings back so many memories! It was in excellent condition and I added to my collection.
3,if you do a body lift go smaller,"i picked this up and i wished i had got the 2 inch beause i had an automatic transmission with the 3 inh you have to cut and weld the shifter linkage if you have a manual go for the 3"""
2,Interesting,"The story was actually quite good, but not executed as well as I hoped. The technical aspects were not so great; e.g. picture and sound. And the acting was mediocre. The supplemental materials were actually more interesting than the movie. None-the-less, I did enjoy it."
1,Mr Kaufman should eat his words with publication of genetic study,"Zalloua et al., Identifying Genetic Traces of Historical Expansions: Phoenician Footprints in the Mediterranean, The American Journal of Human Genetics (2008), doi: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.10.012 suffices to invite Mr. Kaufman to eat his words.Thank goodness for the science of genetics that silences nay sayers."
1,Big let-down!!,"I regret to say that this seller is a flake. I ordered the book entitled ""Reviving Phoenicia:The Search for Identity in Lebanon"" on 12/11/2010. I subsequently received notification of shipment on 12/15/2010, with a delivery estimate of 12/17/10 - 1/4/11. Much to my disappointment, the book never arrived. I finally cancelled my order on 1/7/2011 after having waited over 3 weeks for this book. I would be very hesitant to re-order from this seller again."
5,A good choice for children at a good price,"This exclusive 4 CD BOX SET featuring Disney's greatest children's songs is a best buy. With 100 of the most popular songs for children very well sung and easy to sing along, it is really a BOX SET that you must buy. The quality of recording is excellent and the voice of the singer is good too. You will not do a mistake in buying this BOX SET; it is really a BOX SET to buy."
3,Not too satisfied-please read!,"Not too satisfied with this product. People claim I sound like I'm talking in a wind tunnel and that the volume is low. I've attempted to increase the volume, but I still get that same comment from the people I'm speaking to. As for the convenience of hands-free, I am satisfied but from the clarity standpoint, I am unsatisfied. I'm actually planning to search out better quality Bluetooths to see if they are compatible with my razor phone. It could be an isolated problem, but I might have to seek a better quality item."
2,Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth ...,Don't like this Bluetooth. The piece that goes in your ear is not a good fit at all. I've owned a different bluetooth (that broke) which fit snuggly in the ear even while moving around. The sound quality on the other end is also not very good.
1,Get something with built in noise canceling,"Noise canceling makes a huge difference in sound quality, this does not have it so the sound quality is marginal. The fit kinda sucks too."
2,What? Can't hear you,"I really didn't like this product, i could never hear anything. And if you wanted to do anything while wearing this you had to be careful! It would just flop around on my ear."
3,"Good, but could be better...","The headset is good for answering wirelessly and not being tied to the same location as the phone. It's easy to setup and turn on/off. However, I sometimes hear popping noises and others complain that my voice isn't as clear as it could be. In addition, when the phone isn't in use for a period of time, it seems difficult to get it out of standby mode. Overall, it's decent and has made answering the phone a bit easier, but Motorola should still work out the kinks."
2,Disappointed to say the least...,The H500 was recommended to me by the Verizon salesman who I now think was just trying to get me in and out as quickly as possible. I must be one of those people who's ear this thing just doens't fit right because I can't get it to stay put. It wobbles around like its going to fall off and drives me crazy. The volume is fine when I hold it against my ear but I prefer not to have to walk around looking like a Secret Service agent. Definitely try it on before you buy.
5,More fun than a barrel of fish!,"ok! I'm a long time Myth fan, so I was very suprised to see the new (old?) books brought to life again! Now, I hate to say it, but I always felt that pretty much all of the Myth books have pretty....short endings. Some are cliffhangers, some, maybe the publisher said, no only X # of pages and are very abrupt, and some are just totally unexpected.But the concept of the Myth books is fascinating, and I have gone back many times to read then again and again... Much better when you have the whole series to continue on to! But the series is a must read for anyone who considers themselves a sci-fi fantasy fan! They are hillarious and definately worth the read (I don't suggest reading them IN a library cause I always end up stiffling my snickers and laughs!)"
4,Works well.,"We're probably one of the few households around that still uses a lot of VHS technology, and this device extends the life of our video recorders and players. Recommended for those who need it."
4,Rewinder,It was a little pricey since they don't make the tapes anymore but it was something I needed for them.
5,Just what I needed,Elderly parents have many VHS tapes; we located an old used VCR for them so I wanted a separate rewinder; perfect !!!
4,The best around,"I prefer this VCR rewinder to the few others around because it rewinds the videos at a moderate speed, thus creating less wear and tear on them. The price is also a major plus, with no huge fees for shiping. It makes no noise when used and does not require that you keep an eye on it and making adjustments when using.Easy to use and easy on tapes. I would give it five stars, but I haven't had it a long time so I can't speak about its longevity. Frankly, if it dies after one year it is worthwhile to just buy another one rather than those that wreck one's tapes. I have also reviewed another rewinder sold via Amazon, so you might want to read that also."
1,rewinder sucks!,"Ordered two, as the old one, same name and model, had lasted 5 years.These two BOTH do not work at all. NO lights, nothing. Looks like the motors are missing.ATNonline, who shipped them, said to contact the manufacturer. Yeah, they in China. But, ATNonline refused to accept the return, and also did not provide ANY information on the manufacturer.AMAZON has refunded the money, but frustration over this deal sure chills my attitude.Don't buy anything from ATNonline.JS"
3,Product works fine - Vendor stinks,It's slow but it does the job.I ordered two of them but ANTOnline only sent me one. They reversed the charge on the second one only after I invoked Amazon's A-Z protection. They never admitted to the mistake and basically said I'm lying. Reading through their reviews it quickly becomes apparent that they never admit to ever having made a mistake. That's amazing and a little hard to believe. I'll never do business with that company again and I urge you to do the same.
1,Very poor quality,"Consider this a disposable. If it is worth the money to you to buy one, knowing it will probably fail after a few months, then go ahead."
1,CAUTION-DON'T BUY!,"Attracted to the affordability, I got what I paid for. Within one month, the rewinder stopped functioning. Sent it back (paid $9 postage to do so) and quickly received either a new one or repaired one. Within two weeks, it again stopped working. Just went ahead and bought something better manufactured by another company. Beware! Advise anyone thinking about this item to avoid it!!"
1,rewinder broken after 1 month of use,"This rewinder broke after just one month of use. Worse yet, it ate a treasured tape. I'm very disappointed. I bought it for my 88 year old aunt who is legally blind and watches her old tapes because her vision is so poor she sees some things and fills in the rest by memory. After reading other negative reviews it seems that trying to return the item is more trouble than it's worth."
3,"Good service, mediocre product","The cassette rewinders were provided promptly, but the quality is inconsistent. Both of two work, but one noisily and some slower than the other quieter one."
3,Cheaply Made,I had my rewinder for about 7 months and the auto-stop feature stopped working eventually causing the motor to burn out. Rewinders should pop up the tape when they finish rewinding so as not to place excess wear on the motor. Kind of disappointed it didn't last longer.
3,Great idea for those who still use a VCR,"BUT.....considering I've only used it about 20 times, it should be manufactured with a longer lifespan. If anyone ever decides to bring back the VCR, I'll be first in line to buy."
1,Never worked,The lid wouldn't stay closed if there was a tape in the machine. Exchanging it for a new one wasn't an option so I had to get a refund and buy something else. Wish I had seen other reviews before I clicked purchase.
1,Overpriced. Cheap Chinese Crap.,This unit was a huge disappointment to those of us who still use VHS machines. The machine is flimsy and noisy.
4,"Works as needed and expected, a good product","I bought this rewinder about 2 months ago, and as others have said, it's a bit slow in rewinding the tapes, but it works just fine and is extremely useful in saving wear on my VCR. For those of us who still use VCR's for recording, this is an invaluable product, I would definitely recommend it. I have had absolutely no issues with it, and I use it fairly often, at least 2 - 3 times a week."
3,Pricey,Why don't they expand the jaws another 32nd of an inch and make it useful for a 1 inch hard nut?
3,My little pony,My daughter watched this movie about 3 times then was done with it :( I thought she would love it but she's more into the newer versions.
3,OK movie,My little girl is a great fan of My Little Pony and this is the first one that she has not absolutely loved. I am not sure why but she prefers others to this one. The characters aren't as animated or bright as the other movies. It almost looks like an old movie copied onto a tape. Not sure about this one.
5,great,"great price, game arrived on time. Movie was in great condition and the movie played great. Thank you for great service. i would order from this seller again."
3,My Little Ponies Fan,"My two year old loves Little Ponies. We have almost all of the videos, and usually she sings along and watches without blinking. She did not care for this one. The characters were not as familiar and the songs not as catchy."
1,Dark stories attached,This is not what one expects. the additional stories are dark and I was very disappointed as they were not My Little Pony type stories and should not have even been on the same DVD. PARENTS BEWARE! The other My Little Pony DVDs were fine.
4,Engaging Story,Anna's Trinity is thoroughly engaging and worth a look especially since this is a self-published novel that has done almost everything right. Captivating prose and nice twists throughout should keep you entertained this Autumn.
4,Fantastically Appealing,"I am a former nun and was very much intrigued with ""One Woman's Search For God"" as detailed in the captivating novel, ""Anna's Trinity."" This is an authentic representation of what it is like to live daily with the searching for God and closeness to Him. I found pieces of my own life reflected in the character of Anna Miller. To say I was touched personally is an understatement. The author has done a superb job of discussing the role of women in the Catholic Church to the backdrop of World War 2 America. It fascinated me endlessly and I will probably reread this wonderfully touching story in the very near future."
2,Turgid Prose Rules!,"This self-published book is enormous and needed a good editor. The writing is almost laughable. I am on page 27 and don't know if I will go on. I think I already sense where the ""story"" is going, and the florid writing is irritating me. There are no adjectives left for any other authors to use--this book used every single one of them. I think the positive reviews were written by the author and his friends. Sorry."
2,Not a fan,"My personal issue with these stories is the constant angst of the characters. It's pretty negative. I get tired of all the engines having ""issues"" with one another and grumpy faces. And saying ""shut up"" is not the best example for a toddler. I much rather use the DVD with the english actor ""Thomas Great Discovery"". It has singing and is so much more enjoyable to listen to."
3,Ringo Starr episodes were better,I got this video by accident a tag sale when it was in a Better Late Than Never case. I already had that video and it was only a dollar. Well it's not excatly what I had wanted. George Carlin is a great narrator but these episodes would be better with Ringo narrating. I also find it annoying that in the sodar superstar hall of fame they ignore that the older tapes ever existed. Some of these episodes are really good and they focus on the engines being helpful and useful. I just wish we could enjoy these videoes in there oringinal tapes such as Tenders & Turntables and Better Late than Never. These are good since you can no longer purchase those videos but they never should've been discontinued in the first place.
1,Can't stand the advertising,"I will return this DVD as ""unplayable"". You are actuallyforced to sit through minutes and minutes of trailer &advertising before you are allowed to get to the menuand select an episode."
4,Not a bad mystery,"Ellen Hart's mysteries are a pleasure to read. They have great characters, a cozy setting, and wonderful descriptions of food! This book does not disappoint on any of the above. Despite being able to see the ending coming, I would still reccommend this a a good mystery. And it's nice to know that Jane has finally found a new love interest - as a lesbian I just wish that Ellen Hart would develop that aspect of Jane's character a little more. At times Jane just seems a little too assimilated."
5,Tracks 9 thru 12 wrong,"Tracks 9 thru 12 are out of order. 9 is listed as, (Lifes a beach, but is Staight To Number One, 10 is Lifes a beach but listed as Thanks for coming 11 is Thanks for coming but listed as Would you, 12 is Would you and listed as Straight to number one.I wonder how this can happen. It is wrong on the CD and sleeve. Oh well, Hope this helps."
3,It Just Doesn't Go Anywhere,"I don't have a lot to say about this CD. I bought it because of one track in particular, but overall, I just felt like the music on here came from attempts to be clever or intriguing. It seemed like the group wanted to go somewhere with it but never really got started or knew where to take it."
5,"variety, great music, fun","First heard this in dance class and had to track it down - has great music for a dance warm-up as well as full-out dancing. Unique and very, very fun. (Love the horns.)"
2,Doesn't fit any of my doors,"I just got it today and it doesn't fit any of my doors. It came with hooks and screws to attach them to the wall but I bought it for my door. I am going to have to rig it to fit on my bedroom door. Not sure how I am going to do that yet, but I have some ideas."
3,Not what I expected,"To start off, the top metal hook was too narrow making it very difficult to adjust to my door. The purse hooks are also small..therefore I can only hang certain purses with thin/normal width sized straps. To top it off, my large purses would slide down!Bottom line is...you can hang small to mid size purses on the rack and it's a bargain for the price!"
1,Poor Quality,"Poor Quality, it does not meet my expectation at all. The hook is very bad, why do i need to buy it for that price?"
4,Space conserving!!,This product fulfills the purpose I had in mind. It saves the Space and also easy to hang on to the door.
1,Hanging Purse Rack,This product isn't anything to brag about. I kept it because I did not want to pay to send it back. Overall it is a peice of junk.
4,Purse Rack,"Ideal for limited space and layout. The hooks could be sturdier! With that said, it is displaying my purses beautifully. I needed to change the magnet on the door because the purses weight made the door tilt a bit. Once that was fixed, I had no problem!"
3,Purse hanger,This purse hanger is a nice concept in that you can adjust the height of your purses.It works well for my light bags but my heavy ones weigh down the hook dragging it downwardleaving all my purses clumped up at the bottom.
3,Better than nothing,Hooks are weak and not long enough. My cat was able to undo the bottom latch from the door.But glad they made it because it gives me the storage option.
3,"Great Product, but the hooks aren't coated ""leather"" like pic","I love my new purse hanger, BUT the hooks are plastic, not metal covered with ""leather"" like the closeup picture shows. One of them broke, I assume during transit (bubble wrapped envelope, seller should use a box instead). I tried to super glue it, didn't work. Despite this, I love it and am uploading a pic of all my purses, which includes some large bags and small bags. I found my smaller clutches went better on the bottom, despite the advertised pic showing them increasing in size going down. It's a good and simple design that does what it needs to do. I wish the hooks were stronger though, over time I hope it doesn't warp or break."
1,clips break way to easy.,"Read reviews, thought product would be good. Had for one day, started hang purses up. NO,the clips broke and the purses are little girl purses, not big and heavy. Don't order this product!!! VERY CHEAP CLIPS."
4,handy organizer,"This is a convenient way to store your hand bags or purses, they can be out of the way yet easily accessible. It makes switching out your purse a breeze!! I love mine, so I bought 2 more; another for myself and one for my mom."
1,Waste of money,This had hooks that were too short to extend over any standard door. You can get one just to hang over a closet door much cheaper at a local store.
3,"Good hanger, not that sturdy","I bought this to hang up purses that I don't use frequently on the back of a closet door. I put the other one in the kids' room to hang up small purse sized backpacks and kiddie purses. This purse rack functions adequately and as advertised, but I found that it does not stand up to constant use very well. Mine is doing just fine since I don't add and remove from it all that often, but the one in the kids' room is another story. Several of the movable clips have simply broken off resulting in sharp pieces of black plastic on the floor for little feet to step on, and not to mention a choking hazard. I realize it's not marketed as a kids' product, and I would not recommend that for it's use. If you just want to hang up some stuff and mostly leave it there, its just fine."
3,Works if held with duct tape,"The metal pins on mine snapped, regardless of whether small or big bags were hung on it.So I duct taped the strap to my closet door. Problem solved (just looks ugly)."
2,Flimsy & Temporary,"Product seemed to work well (with the exception of being able to hold larger, wider strap purses) for the first two months. After that, about half of the clips have snapped off. The product would be better served with metal clips."
2,My mistake.,My mistake I did not check the thickness of my door and clips are too small to hang on the door. Wish they do some thing more intelligent to adjust the clip thickness according to every door. Sincce the door thickness differs house to house.
1,Disappointed,I bought this product at Bed Bath and Beyond and all of the clips have broken. I am looking for an alternative method of how to store all of my handbags. The clips need to be able to handle the weight of the newer larger handbags that are made of leather.
2,"OK, but nothing great","It does fit into my clsoet, but this is way flimsier than I thought it would be. Larger bags have a tendency to slide down or fall off."
4,Works but came cracked,"The product is working great. I ordered the two pack and I'm using one for purses and one for scarves. I was able to put two small purses on a couple of the hooks with no trouble. My only complaint is that one of the hooks came cracked. The hook was attached yet and I am using it but It's cracked so I doubt it will last too long. I didn't want to go through the trouble of returning it. Also, I wish you could add hooks."
1,Why plastic?,These hooks hold no considerable weight. I had a set of 2 on a door and all but 2 of the hooks have cracked and fallen apart. Good for small purses or light totes but definitely not for heavy leather or wide-strap bags. The manufacturer needs to look into making a more durable hook (metal or similar strength)for those heavier bags.
3,It's not the best,"I received my order yesterday and I was not 100% satisfied. It works like it says, except it doesn't fit my standard closet door (concerning length.) The clips that allow the product to hang on the door are fine and the clips that move up and down the strap to hang your bags are fine. It is just the bottom clip won't reach to the bottom of my door. All in all, I would say these are best to be mounted on the wall, which I cannot do. My suggestion: Measure your closets and match that up with product specs before ordering!"
2,Don't buy this unless you have a sewing machine to reinforce it,"Yes, this comes with two in the package. I don't think it's any coincidence that each of the hooks snapped off of BOTH of the straps. Is it really that difficult to reinforce a stitch in order to hold the weight of multiple purses??? After I took both of the straps to my sewing machine and put some GOOD stitches in, it worked fine. I absolutely love it....but it was created very poorly.Don't buy this unless you have a sewing machine to reinforce it. Great idea, poor creation."
2,Not strong at all,"I was so excited about this when I first got it. But since then 4 clips cracked right in half. Once while adjusting it and the others simply by the weight of the purse or bumping a purse while walking by. I am trying to figure out a way to fashion my own hooks. Shouldn't have to, though."
4,A Good Space-Saver,"This is a nice space-saver for those who lack the space. The itemJokari Hanging Purse Rackis easy to snap on any door without any damage to it, and is sturdy enough to hold many purses. Not as many as in the picture if you have purses on the bigger side or that have longer handles. But on the bright side the item is sturdy enough to hold a purse that contains another smaller one. Also the plastic hooks tend to slide if you use a bigger bag and you have to pay attention as to keep it in place. It will hold but you need to secure it, more than once. The hook that holds a big bag might even slide even if you are trying to take a bag above or under it, just by mere brushing the bag. You just have to secure it in place again and make sure it stays in place. Not a huge inconvenience but it can be annoying.I have had no trouble with the smaller bags it works like a charm, I even use it to hang a couple of hats, actually it would be a great hat hanger if you have many."
2,purse rack,This purse rack was not as good as i thought it would be. I put it up on my door and started to put my purses on it and it popped right off of the door. The rack holds very light purses not heavy ones or the normal purses. it holds only light cloth purses not leather ones. I was very mad that i bought this stupid thing!
2,no door hooks included,bought this for my wife and much to my dismay she was not impressed ..don't know how well it works because no hardware was included ..can i mount it? yes. were we happy with the product ..nope
5,Love it,Fast delivery did not have to drill any holes on the door very functional can be used for other items too This was a great purchase durable and efficient Thank you
3,TWO pack,"one of these mounting hooks broke as i was hanging purses on it, and they don't include extras. so, one down. the other one works great- so far. I just feel like i'm waiting for it's mounting bracket to break , too....."
2,I dont know who has doors this slim....,didnt fit on top of the door. I tried to make the handle a bit larger and the metal piece broke almost immediately
3,will never hold all the items you see in the picture,"this product needs a ratchet feature to tighten down on a door, in its current design its too loose to fit an average door. does work for the small items"
1,"good, good, BAD","this is a hard review cause the metal rack for over the kitchen cupboard was great and one of the over the door hanging purse racks was good also, but the 2nd one i ordered came with not 1, not 2, but 4 broken purse clasp!"
1,Not at all what I thought it was - Beware,"This product sounded like a great idea! It would have been had the product not been cheaply made. Definately NOT for normal to large sized handbags. The ""hooks"" (plastic flat things) did not secure the handbags and when I finally did get one to stay they slipped. These were not overly large or heavy bags. Just normal size handbags. If the handbags do stay on long enough the whole thing is bulky and takes up a lot of space behind or in front of the door. In my opinion this is not worth the price paid. Wish I had the packaging to return. :("
2,Great idea but hooks break.,I bought this product for my daughter's room. She loves purses. She is 9 so most purses are small. We had 2 hooks break before we even got it completely up on the door. We kept it becasue my daughter was deperate for storage and it is an awesome concept. We just wish for a sturdier hook.
3,It gets the job done,"At first I was disappointed when I received it because its really low technology. It is a cord with elastic ends and 4 hooks that are placed over and under the door. You attach the cords and then move up and down the hooks for the bags. It looks great it this photo because the bags have either thin handles or one handle. I have huge round bags, long bags with straps, etc. so in my room it doesn't look so great. I kept it anyway because I haven't seen a better alternative. I used one pair in my room and then gave my two daughter one each from the pair to organize their bags. It does the job it promised which is to organize but it only looks this neat if you have small rectangular hard bags. So even though it wasn't quite what I expected, it is indeed very functional."
3,OK product,I purchased this item to organize my closet better and for the price it's an OK product; it does help in having all the bags in one place but it looks cheap and not very durable...only time will tell the quality!
3,hooks too narrow,"When this product came, one strap was shorter than the other and took great effort to hang on the door.The material is rather flimsy and wouldn't hold up heavier leather purses. Also, to hang my purses on, I'd have to fold straps of many of my leather of wider strapped purses. So now I'm using this as a belt-hanger instead."
4,Love Purses?,"As someone who has too many purses and no room to put them, this worked out great. Be carefully hooking it on your door though, my husband almost got a black eye. OOOOPPS!!!"
2,measure ur door 1st,"its too small for my door, i thought its suppose to fit on all doorsi needed it for my door not my wallits useless"
1,Smoke gets in your Eye,"Upon saging myself AFTER reading this book and other web sites promoting this author -This book is bogus and harmful to Native American Indian people, who share knowledge and sell authentic medicine and art.The people who promote books like this selling themselves as Indians are liars. I have already spoken with them. They and their sales group/links are decieving the public, online and at the Fairs they attend. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Where It All Started,"Guy Clark is still going strong as a song-writer and performer, but neither he nor anybody else has ever been any better than he is here, with searing, heart-rending songs of loneliness and hurt and exuberantly happy songs about the good times.There are some great songs here. I think that every small-town boy living in a big city has felt the homesickness that ""L.A. Freeway"" describes, but none of the rest of us has said it so well, nor has any other world-weary bachelor described his love for his new-found lady as well as Clark does in ""Like a Coat From the Cold"". ""She Ain't Goin' Nowhere"" would be the best song ever written about taking charge of your life if Clark hadn't equaled it later with ""Better Days"". Those are three of the best songs on this CD, but they aren't the only great ones here."
5,"""Old No. 1"" is still No. 1","""Old No. 1"" is his first and possibly his best. I first heard the heart-tugging, homesick words of ""L.A. Freeway"" 25 years ago, and it's still as fine today as it was then. Every song on this album is a gem. Not bad for an ol' boy from Monahans, Texas."
5,Welcome back,"I had the original LP's but they got lost in one of the many moves made over the years. In CD, the albums have been released and discontinued in a cycle that I couldn't keep up with and never bought. I could only find ""The Essential Guy Clark"" which is a reasonable facsimile of his first two albums. Still it didn't feel right to listen to a different order of the songs with a couple left out. Now both Guy's first albums are available again and it's truly ""essential""."
5,A great Texas singer/songwriter,"I've heard several Guy Clark tunes over the years, but I'm embarrassed to admit I've been very late in really digging into his discography. His first two albums are a great place to start. The singing and playing on this disc are really wonderful, but his songwriting is what shines through the strongest. If you love Texas singer/songwriters like Steve Earle, Tom Russell and Townes Van Zandt you have to check out Old No. 1/ Texas Cookin'. You won't be disappointed."
2,NOT PURE STERLING SILVER AS DESCRIBED,"I purchased this ring as a gift for my husband (who works on the ocean). The design is wonderful and unique. However, we have purchased (and wear) numerous items made of pure sterling silver and know that they do not turn your fingers green or tarnish. This item made a green ring around his finger within hours of putting it on. Within a couple days it was already turning gray/brown on the inside from tarnishing. It is NOT pure silver and should not be sold/described as such. It is a cheap piece of jewelry. Unfortunate, because the concept and design are very charming."
5,SHERRIE AUSTIN IS AWESOME!!!,"This album is different from other country albums. The songs are all great! Sherrie Austin has a voice that stands out and is very different from other female singers. Her songs are written in a very different style. ""Lucky In Love"", ""Words"" and ""Innocent Man"" are different from any other country song I've ever heard. She deserves more credit then she gets! Even my husband is crazy about her voice and music! She got a style of her own in her music and I think she is far more talented then Shania Twain!!"
3,Could have been much better,"This is not a bad book, but it simply could have been much better. The story concerns a remote Antarctic station and a discovery of a frozen dinosaur egg. The egg is broght back to the station, where it hatches through a speed-up process using nuclear waste. What hatches is a T-rex baby, which very quickly grows into the scarriest man-eating machine ever to walk the Earth. What follows is alot of gore and violence as the T-rex kills and eats anything in sight. What kills the book is the stupid, idiotic female character. Her lines and actions are so dumb that the author destroyed a good idea by placing her inside this novel. Otherwise, it was fun."
4,A delightfully silly novel that delivers thrills and chills.,"I loved this book. I couldn't read it fast enough and hated to see it end. Where the hell is the sequel Mr. Clark!?Carnivore uses numerous situations/plot elements from both versions of THE THING as well as Roger Corman's Carnisaur movies. And anyone who knows anything about the quality of life at the South Pole will find the whole thing laughable. But I'll be dipped in t-rex dung if I didn't finish this thing in a day or two. Mr. Clark...bring me a sequel! A real guilty pleasure, but I loved it!"
4,Maneating dino,"This wasn't a excellent book in the sense of I'll ever read it again. But I was not disappointed in this book. There is alot of carnage, and I mean ALOT. This dino eats everything in sight. He's intelligent, works things out. I didn't care that the dino never seemed to get ""full"". I didn't find this book scary just gory. You pretty much know who's going to survive until the end. It reads like a horror movie, this isn't a bad thing. It's easy reading and I found it be a page turner. The dino is relentless too, just like a horror movie where the bad guy just never seems to die once. If you are looking for a gory, quick, dino horror novel, this is for you. Whether the author did research on the subject at hand, I could really care less. I don't read for facts, not a fiction novel. The whole point is to just be a good story."
5,as good as Jurasic Park,"This was a great book I didn't think it was that predictible. The attacks were kind of predictable, but the suspence was great. Most authors don't put their main characatures in such of a predicament. I loved the book and I thought it as better than Jurrasic park"
3,childish gore,"I did not expect a prize winning novel but it was just one scene of dino-chomping people gore after another, I could not even finish it."
3,"Absurd, but Fun at Times","You ever wish someone would novelize those cheesy flicks they show on the SyFy Channel? Well ""Carnivore"" comes pretty darn close.An Arctic science station discovers a dino egg buried in a glacier, and they decide to hatch the thing using radioactive waste as a catalyst. Before long the T-Rex is running around snapping up scientists and mercenaries in it's powerful jaws. Leigh Clark seems to take extra delight in providing all of the gory, gooey details, the carnage is presented in loving (and quite often repetitive) detail. Throw in a maniacal ex-colonel running the base who seems to enjoy killing almost as much as the T-Rex, and you can have some fun with ""Carnivore"".If you are looking for a tight, suspense filled novel, look elsewhere. ""Carnivore"" is pure cheese, but if that is what you are in the mood for, then you should enjoy it."
1,Dinostinker,"Good thing this book takes place in the Artic, the cold will help keep the smell down cause this book is just plain bad. Exposure to radiation causes the T-rex to grow at a excellerated rate? Why not take it one step further, have the monster grow big enough to trash Tokyo like Godzilla. Don't bother with this one"
1,Awful,"There are very few books I never finished. Carnivore was one of them. It was absolutely the dumbest fiction books I ever had the misfortune to buy. The characters were less then one dimensional. The attacks were poorly written. The people seemed to be absolutely oblivious to any of the danger. And the author seemed to invent new personell out of thin air simply to have them be eaten.Stupidity abounded. A giant insane killer prowling around outside the facillity? I for one would retreat to the absolute center. Five walls between me and the monster is better then one wall.In short, do not buy this book. Do not borrow this book."
2,The Author just quit,"This book had an interesting premise but three-quarters of the way through the book, the author just seemed to tire of it and ran out of ideas to end it. Felt like a cop-out ending. Very disappointed in what started out as a exciting book."
4,Very good read. Interesting to say the least,"A superb idea to say the least. I loved the story, the overall premise is just an incredible idea and makes for a great story. However, If you are looking for wholly developed characters you will not find them in this book. That would be my only complaint. He could have done alot more with the premise. It is a quick read and I was actually dissapointed when I was finished because i still wanted to know more. But its definately a page turner and most will enjoy the ride. I know I did."
4,Thought-provoking,"When I started this novel, I was uncertain of what to expect. By the third chapter, I could not put it down. The characters were well-developed and the plot so imaginative, that I still find myself thinking about this book now, weeks after I finished reading it. I highly recommend this novel."
2,Author stumbles right before the finish line...,"This is a very unusual book with an intriguing premise. I very much enjoyed the way the first 3/4 of the book...as others have said, the characters are really well-drawn and the author did a great job of interweaving the story of the dead with the story of the last living human being on earth. But the book falls completely flat at the end - it really feels like the author didn't know himself where he wanted to take the story, so he meandered a while and then just - ended it. It's intriguing enough that it's worth reading, just don't be shocked by the dull ending."
3,Decent book,"This book wasn't quite as good as I had expected, though I can't quite put my finger on why. I do know I was disappointed in the ending. Still, it was worth reading."
3,A story that will stay with you for a long time.,"A haunting story that creates a new version of Heaven, and a tale of humanities last days on earth.The only downside to this novel is its ending - which is decidedly depressing.A sad but worthwhile read."
4,Read it... you won't be dissappointed,"The most thoughtful and articulate book I have read in a long time. I was compelled to turn each page.Mr Brockmeier, you have done well..."
1,"Excellent short story, exhausting novel","After the 1st couple of chapters, I got the concept of the novel and was curious to see where the author would take it. Upon reading the last page, I found out he only took it as far as the first couple of chapters.This book is exhausting, having little exploration or depth to an idea or theme. Instead, the Brockmeier just repeats ideas over and over again, without digging deep into the characters. One of the characters, Minny, feels like she'll never know anyone deeply or intimately. At the end of the read, I felt the same way about the characters in the book or the themes.Do yourself a favor if you want to read this: don't buy, get it from the library, read the first 50 pages, and then promptly quit.Originally this was a short story and would have held up well by itself. However, since there's more money in selling novels than stories, they had to publish the thing that drug on and on...like the protoganist's endless hike through the snow."
3,Just okay,"This book has such an interesting premise that I was really looking forward to reading it. Unfortunatley, the author seemed to just skip over the story and didn't really delved into it like I would have liked."
3,Good concept that falls short in the end,"A quick, enjoyable adventure wrapped up in an ""unspiritual"" story of the afterlife. It ended, however, with a whimper, almost as if Brandmeier couldn't bring himself to simply let it end. Instead, we follow Laura Byrd beyond the point where she and the reader should have parted ways and the journey gets a little tiring."
1,What just happened?,I saw the cover for this book when a friend of mine was reading it. The title was intriguing and after reading the synopsis I just knew I had to read this book. What a let down. The title and the idea behind the book are the best things about it. There is essential no plot. Interesting things happen. The arduous journey through the Antartic was interesting and I got involved with that character while reading about it. But I couldn't help but feel cheated after spending time reading half a book with a bad ending.
3,You know the whole book by the time you get to the middle.,"I have to say the opening chapter of this book was one of the best I have seen. I absolutely loved it, then it fell off. The idea is great but you get to about the 80th page and you know the answer and start feeling like, well why am I reading this. I know what happeneds. Then I got to about the 100th page and skipped to the end two chapters and hoped ( because he is a great writer) that the end would make me think, and what it made me think was, why would I read the whole thing?"
2,disappointing,"I got the book based on two enthusiastic reviews. It starts well, but loses its way. It has a very interesting premise that is never developed. It becomes a series of short stories attempting to be held together by the link of the woman in Antartica. I'm not sure what the author was trying to do or what the story was trying to say. Perhaps we all live on only so long as our contemporaries exist to remember us. Again, an interesting story concept that was unexecuted and undeveloped."
3,decent book with a weird acid-trip ending,"i would have given this bk 4 stars if not for the let-down ending. this bk was very gripping, full of great quotes and edge-of-your-seat in antarctcia chpts but the endign suxed, it just kinda...stopped. and not in a good way. very drug-trippy ending.the rest of the bk was great though, very interesting idea of having the body die and the rest of you goes somehwere else to live another life til everyone who remembered you is dead as well. i liked it. just wish the ending hadnt suxed."
2,Deeply disappointing,"The premise is intriguing, and the first few chapters start off good, but the book soon gets bogged down in various threads, all of which are, frankly, uninteresting. I had the urge to skim and read ahead to see if things got interesting again. Sadly, they never did. The dark, nearly depressing tone did not help matters either, made all the worse by the fact that there is no real connection to any of the characters. All in all, this feels like a decent short story that was stretched in a dull, drawn-out novel."
2,Somewhat dull book,I just started reading this book but find it somewhat dull. I do hope it gets more interesting as I read it further.
2,Not as good as I was led to believe,"I picked up this book based on recommendations and good reviews that were posted here. I was greatly disappointed. I had a lot of difficulty I getting through this book which seemed like a poor imitation of Richard Matheson's ""What Dreams May Come."" The author of this book must have read that book first to get his ideas for this book but he did a poor job of trying to put a different spin about places beyond death. I suggest reading Matheson's book instead which is excellent!"
1,The Not Brief Enough History of the Dead,"I read the promising reviews and found the story's premise interesting, but what a let down. I eagerly read the first few chapters and then discovered that the author really didn't have much more to say. Oh, he kept building his characters into what should have become some sort of crescendo, but sadly there was none, and the plot simply fizzled out and died. On the last twenty pages or so, I found myself skipping over whole paragraphs in a vain search for something interesting to happen. I couldn't wait for the main character to die so I could finally understand the ultimate reality the author, no doubt, was going to reveal in the end. It seems the author simply got tired of rambling on about the characters and decided to hastily bail out."
2,Dhalgren Meets White Plague,"Reminds me of a hybrid between Delany's ""Dhalgren"" and Herbert's ""White Plague"" with a lot of metaphysical, existential matter stuffed inbetween. Don't read this book if you're looking for other-worldly sci fi action because the words don't flow smoothly enough for that. I found myself chugging along, plodding through this book waiting for something exciting to happen. Maybe it was just the narrator of the audiobook that I found tedious. Maybe you just have to be in the mood to think deep thoughts about the significance of the blind man, the city, and Laura Byrd. I wasn't."
2,"Well written, well conceived, but deeply depressing","I don't have any new critique of this novel to add but I want to mention that several of the themes and certainly the ending, have left me feeling deeply sad and hopeless. I was drawn in by the first few chapters and an admiration for the creative undertaking. The last quarter of the book is perhaps the most depressing thing I've ever read -- not something I typically walk away with from a book. Maybe not a good book to take on if you're not in the mood."
3,"fun at first, then pretentious","The concept was good, but much more as a cute and thought-provoking idea, a neat little daydream, than as the full-length exploration it turns into. As soon as I realized that we were supposed to take the idea seriously -- that it was supposed to be profound rather than just cute, that it was supposed to be about something real instead of just a kind of sci-fi/fantasy flight of fancy -- my enjoyment turned to something more like irritation. By the end of the book, I felt I was being condescended to. That said, the book has some good parts and is reasonably well written."
2,From Great to Ghastly,"Maybe ghastly's too strong, but progressing from a riveting start to a dismally open-ended finish was quite a letdown. The premise of the story was fascinating and its delivery was skillful. This was a page-turner that had me halfway through the book the first night. One part of the story, involving a religious zealot/prophet, totally lost me and I ended up skipping that chapter. I should have known it was prophetic and stopped there. The telling of the tale and the increasing tie-in between the two ""worlds"" progresses quite well through most of the book but the last two or three chapters are more and more ""out there"", tedious, and ultimately very disappointing. I'm not sure what the resolution could be, but I was distinctly dissatisfied with what I felt to be an open-ended letdown of an ending. Because it was a quick, short read I don't have to regret a big time investment but I still feel betrayed by a terrible ending; or should I say, ""non-ending""?"
2,Fantasy with little redeeming value.,"The book never pulled things together- it was like a loosely related short story collection. I was expecting an ending with the Coca-Cola cover-up gathering up all the loose ends, but the ends remained loose and truncated. I also didn't need to look up a single word in the dictionary so I learned nothing new- no new words, no new facts, no new culture, just an unbelievable idea of what happens when we die. Fantasy. There is too much out there to waste my time reading without gaining something from a book."
1,lost in translation,"this book started out very interesting but as others have reported, got lost in the shallows. Yes, very original, but even though I did finish it, I don't know why I did or what the message (if there was one) was..... Probably one of the strangest books I have ever started and really finished. Did not like it......"
1,I started skimming at page 114...,"I don't know what I was expecting. I read the review in Newsweek, and I guess I was expecting excitement on the order of a Resident Evil movie: plagues, undead, single survivor, etc. However, instead of ""Resident Evil: Apocolypse"" I got ""Dull and Duller."" It's two stories intertwined and neither one is terribly interesting. I must confess that I skimmed through the last half of the book looking for something interesting to happen. As far as I could tell, nothing interesting ever happened. I just finished ""The Kite Runner"" which was the best book I've read in the last five years. If you're looking for a really great read, buy a copy of ""The Kite Runner."" If you're looking for a good futuristic, end of society type book, get ""The Wanting Seed"" by Anthony Burgess. But do yourself a big favor and skip this snooze fest."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","This book starts out great - what an interesting idea. However, 100% of the story is given away in the first two chapters, and the remainder of the book simply plays out the inevitable. There are no surprises, no twists, nothing to keep your interest.I also found the writing style less than engaging. The whole book is an internal dialog that feels like I'm overhearing the thoughts of a regular person - that is, it's not very exciting.If you want a really captivating story about life after death, read Farmer's Riverworld series."
5,"I loved this book, despite lack of easy answers","This book will not answer your questions or calm your fears about whether there is life after death. It will make you think about your everyday interactions with friends, family, and strangers, and make you more appreciative of how impactful they can be. It's just a little bit sci-fi, but don't let that turn you off - it's a terrific spiritual tale for those who don't need their novels to be wrapped up in tidy little ""DaVinci Code"" sorts of ribbons and bows."
3,Interesting premise,"Generally enjoyed it. Not great, but an easy read. The story of the woman going across the arctic dragged. A little disappointed in the denouement."
2,A human nightmare,The book wandered like the human mind during a restless night of dream and niightmare filled sleep. Thought provoking. Try describing this book to a friend!!!
3,striking concept but tedious reading,"One of the most original ideas i've read in a while. Two stories are happening at once--this world and the awakening world upon dying. Then there are a myiad of characters in each......then the characters have flashback presentations and variances--------all this adds to the confusion and lets you experience the confused state of dying and arriving in a distant city not knowing what has happened or where exactly the characters are. So you begin to feel as they do. However, as the people of two different views of the same experince began to flashback I found the maze of descriptions more involved to the point of me losing where i was in the story and finally actually skipping some paragraphs to get past it and back to the story movement itself. Wish there had been more direct line about the city side of the story and less depth and detail of the flashback--------but that is just me-loved the bookThe Brief History of the Dead"
3,Runs out of Gas,"Wonderful premise, interesting story, richly descriptive but it feels as though he got tired of writing without any idea how to end it and he just said, ""To hell with it"" and wrapped it up anyway he could. It has the feel that one gets when you look at abstract art; you know it is a mess but you think that there must be some deeper meaning because, well, somebody put it in a frame and put it on display."
2,Started out great ...,"I enjoyed this book until the last few chapters. I was thoroughly disappointed. The chapters that left you wondering how long you have to follow the marbles were BORING. Then when you got to the end, it left you with nothing. By the time I finished, I was wondering why I read this book. I haven't felt that way about a book in a LONG TIME. Don't buy it - go to your library and get it, if you must."
4,"Compelling plot, good storyline, falls a little flat at the end","The story and writing are very good. There are elements from the different story lines that are woven together very cleverly and there are very vivid and suspenseful moments in the story. There were a few threads of character development, however, that seemed to be drug out a little bit too long.Overall, it was a very good read (listen) but the ending was a little abrupt and disappointing though."
2,Interesting read but lacking,"I love reading books that make you think. This is definitely one of those books. I love being able to visually explore what the author has painted with his words. While I was intrigued with the story line and the very concept, I'll have to agree with some of the previous comments about the characters lacking any really interesting qualities. Overall I didn't feel a connect to any one of them and when the book was over I kind of just sat there for a moment with a glazed over look in my eyes. I commend him for the effort though, as the subject matter in itself was very interesting."
4,Pleasantly unusual,"This was a fun book, and it offered some interesting commentary on the human race. The sentences are clean and well-written, and the author has a great ability to describe life as it really is. What pleased me most was the novelty of both the ideas and the perspective (the end of the world, partly from the point of view of those who have already died). What a treat to not know the ending, to not feel like you and the author are both just plodding to an obvious, neatly-tied-with-a-bow conclusion."
2,"Good concept, execution eventually grows very boring","I just read a few of the recent reviews here; most of which liked it quite a bit. I think it would have made an excellent short story. The ""two stories"" running together was good - the living keeping the dead living in memory - but Laura's part was padded, redundant, tiresome, and poorly written eventually. (Other segments had the same feeling, but never as tiresome.) If it were much, much tighter the story would have kept one's interest. I found myself jumping many paragraphs later in the book re Laura because it was repetitive, eventually not realistic, etc. Again, the immediate story and concept fine, the execution not well done."
2,Great beginning goes nowhere,"It's an interesting read for about half the book, then you begin to suspect that the author isn't going to make much with what he's started with. There is a lot of extraneous information about cross-ice travel, and a fairly irrelevant street preacher, and some fantasy segments of ""crossings."" But it's mainly a good idea that needed better development, a frequent downfall with science fiction."
4,Wow!,"My gosh if you've read the other reviews then you know everything there is to know about this book. So, as usual I'll be brief. Wow! What an idea for a book - Got to give the author credit for the novelty. Certainly not boring, eccentrically interesting (what a nice couple of words that happen to describe Mr. Brockmeier's style exactly). I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I don't really give a hoot if you purchase it or obtain it at a library, but if you enjoy different - yes different, then go for it."
4,Read it!,"""The Brief History of the Dead"" is by no means a perfect book, but it IS original, thought-provoking, gorgeously written and, ultimately, very moving. Kevin Brockmeier has taken some huge risks in attempting this very complex novel and, for the most part, they pay off. At first, I thought the first part of the book ""telegraphed"" too much of what would happen in the second half, but I was wrong. I was riveted, waiting to find out exactly how the two parts of the story would converge, and along the way to a very satisfying conclusion, I laughed, I cried, I was frightened, and I thought a great deal. I recommend it highly."
2,"Not for those who go in for ""good novels""","I despise the sort of review that wraps up with a cautionary ""Of course if you're too dim, shallow or poorly educated to *appreciate* work of this caliber..."" Well trust me, this is not one of those works whose greatness might be overlooked by us troglodytes. It's a mediocre work at best no matter how pretentious the reader.The premise of an afterworld suspended by the memories of the still-living is compelling, the writing clumsy. The ending? Was there an ending? Did I learn something? Travel anyplace? Feel anything? Unless the publisher options a sequel (horrors! a trilogy!)I believe the characters are all safely dead. And that's fine by me.Read anything (anything but especially ""All The Names"") by José Saramago if you're looking for an artful handling of the power of memory."
2,flatlined,"Agreeing with previous reviewers, I found the concept of this novel to be irresistible so listened to it on cd-format. Was that a mistake. After becoming intrigued by the storyline and interested in the plot, nothing happens. Nothing. The last 7 cd's take me nowhere the first cd didn't already go. The ending is completely unsatisfying and a cop-out, and the ""connections"" the characters make throughout do not resonate. I also agree with the reviewer who claimed they know nothing about Laura, who is central to this story. This was a terrible ""read"" and I am extremely disappointed I listened to this whole book on cd."
4,Don't Try to Pigeonhole this One,"It's not a fantasy, but it is. It's not social commentary, maybe. This book is in a class by itself. A very classy class, I might add. If you like odd, thought-provoking books, this one is for you. Otherwise...Go ahead, try it. It's short. Give yourself a totally different book experience."
3,Don't bother with L-shaped hex wrenches,"If you're going to buy individual hex wrenches, do yourself a favor and get T-Handled wrenches. They have better finesse and more leverage (yes, both) - and they're harder to misplace. I can guarantee you that you will lose L wrenches. It will ALWAYS be the one that you need the most - the ones you never use, of course, will be sitting right in their little stand where they always are."
4,I do recommend this one isntead of buying the book,"I do recommend this one isntead of buying the book, because reading one by day will make it more easy to remember, however I gave it 4 stars because I dont like the idea of not giving you a worst case scenaria situation for every day, because in some days you will get an history fact about survival, tough you may like it."
2,25% survival tips - 75% rubbish,Don't bother purchasing this calendar. It neither functions as a calendar (it doesn't display either the week or month ahead) or as a surival guide.Take my tip and give it a miss.
2,"This calendar is not far from a ""Worst Case Scenario""","For those who love the Worst Case Scenario books, prepare yourself for disappointment. The books are filled with hilarious ""how to"" diagrams and instructions, but this calendar only has those for about half of the days--the remaining days are marked by anecdotes presented as ""Today in Survival History"" and ""Today's Hero."" These things are just not very interesting or funny and bear no consistency with the spirit and humor of the books and how-tos. They are just plain lame.So consider this:HOW TO AVOID BEING BORED BY THE WORST CASE SCENARIO DAILY SURVIVAL CALENDAR1. Don't purchase it (stick with the books);or2. If purchased, carefully and completely tear off the pages entitled ""Today in Survival History"" and ""Today's Hero"" and deposit them in the nearest waste receptacle by wadding them up into compact, ball-shaped mounds and either throwing or placing them in such waste receptacle. If unsuccessful, re-attempt with greater force and/or accuracy."
5,fatal exposure,"Love this movie! Seen it a few years ago when it first aired and had to have it! Love Nick and Mare in this movie!Wished it was on DVD, but the VHS played great."
3,"Solid shirt, but only for the right person","This T-shirt is pretty awesome considering Death is one of the greatest bands ever. The only drawback is the shirt itself is kinda on the big side. Now im only about 5'6"" so i realize that this probably wont pertain to most people but I bought a size M and even after 2 washes it still hangs off of me like a dress. For a bigger person this shirt would be perfect but be advised these shirts run large. Other than that, excellent shirt."
3,"Oh, somewhere between 3 and 4 stars","As a prequel, this was quite good in that it shed a lot of light on the series characters' backgrounds and relationships. It also made Lynley seem a lot more human. The puzzles were pretty good, too. But it was difficult to get into the search for the killer of a couple of prime jerks, and that made the story on the whole a bit flat. That's why I just can't give it 4 stars. But if you like the series already and plan to read more, this one is a must."
2,Aristrocratic deceit,"Written in the early 90's ...who would believe an entire household playing head games with attempted rape, addiction, violence and deceit, not to mention marital abuse, and murder most foul? There is an elephant in the middle of the room in every scene. Painful to watch everyone pretending that everything is just fine. A bunch of royal misfits who are pathetic. Surely a murder mystery could have SOME minor characters with a bit of spine. I have run out of patience to see if anyone will eventually behave in an interesting or authentic manner. Think I will return my copy half-read. Ms. George does seem to stress the down and dirty and violent. I loved the PBS series, Inspector Lynley."
3,Rated PG13 For Foul Language and Sexual Situations,I don't recommend. But I enjoyed reading it. I love the characters and the mystery. I don't like the attitude towards sex outside of marriage. I also don't like the foul language.
1,A Pleased Review Reader,I didn't read this book and I never plan to. That first review made me decide never to read any of Liza George's books. But I would like to know who that reviewer is and has he/she had anything published.
3,An Early Episode,"For fans of the Lynley-Havers series, Elizabeth George offers an episode that occurs a few years prior to the time of the first book, A Great Deliverance. In this installment, she provides back-story that illuminates some of the complex inter-relationships between Lynley, Simon, and Deborah. Absent (but for a brief cameo) are Havers and her sharp words for the privileges of the upper classes -- which were in great need here. George, who is among mystery writers a master of characterization, here devises a mystery that seems not just secondary to the personal stories of her characters, but even incidental. In fact, the solution to the mystery seems a bit facile. Hopefully, in her subsequent novels George will return to the approach that worked well in the first three novels, wherein she spins a marvelous mystery that any observant reader could solve and, along the way, continuously deepens the reader's understanding of some very likable characters."
2,Terrible book - full of melodrama - completely unrealistic,I enjoyed reading the first three books in this series. Each was an improvement on the previous one. But this book is awful. The fact that this book is a prequel to the series does not affect my review. But the writing is just terrible. The characters make the most outlandish and hyperbolic statements. No one talks like these characters! Their behavior is often at odds with their characters. Written in the style of a harlequin romance; there is absolutely nothing subtle about emotions or reactions. I think that the book was plotted in advance and the characters were written to meet the requirements of the plot. Never mind that none of the characters behave in a realistic manner. Never mind that the characters are only caricatures. I cannot recommend this book to anyone.
3,Not up to Elizabeth George's usual standard.,"I have been a fan of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley novels for years. When I picked up this book, I was expecting her usual excellent plotting and character development. I was particularly interested in why ""Tommy"" Lynley is a person who has trouble with relationships, especially with women. Although this question and others are answered in ""A Suitable Vengeance,"" unfortunately the book is something of a potboiler. It is tediously plotted and the story is melodramatic and uninvolving. Although George tends to write long novels, in the case of ""A Suitable Vengeance"" the novel ran out of steam well before the last page. I lost interest somewhere in the middle and plodded on to the end. George's recent books are quite a bit better than this one, I am happy to say."
4,Great CD!,This is one of the few CD's you can actually listen to all the way through! Every song is great. I first heard Charmed when on vacation in Florida and had to buy the CD. I don't regret the buy at all. I really can't wait to see them in concert!
2,Very Average CD. Not as good as I thought it would be.,"I'm really into alot of newer groups that almost nobody knows. Like Far too Jones, Tonic, The Nixons, The Gufs, ect. I heard Charmed on the radio and loved it. I thought this group would be another to add to my collection of favorites. But it really isn't that great of a cd. It has a couple of good songs. But overall I was a bit disappointed with this CD."
3,Not worth the price!,You might as well use brown gravy and add the noodles and chives or whatever spices that was in it.
1,Love it but RUSTED after only 2 months!,"I bought two ""20-piece, service for 4"" sets and one 5-piece serving set. I absolutely love the design but all of the pieces are slowly starting to rust after only using them for 2 months! I am very disappointed. This is suposedly made form stainless steel so it shouldn't rust. If it were only a couple pieces that rusted I'd think it was a defect but for almost ALL of them too, I'm questioning the material it's made of or if it's really low quality stainless steel."
3,not totally satisified,I really love the style and weight of this product .. Although on a few pieces the knot/twist seems to break free which means it slides up/down the handle.(reported it to company and they replaced product...although it took 3 months to receive replacement) also noticing rusting on some other pieces hopefully the company will work with me on that issue.
5,High Quality,I already had one set of this unique flatware - purchased it at a yard sale for $10 (lucky me!). Today I ordered two more sets to complete my 12 place setting. Friends ALWAYS compliment me about the quality and ask me where I got it! Nice heavy guage and 18/10 stainless steel - it won't rust and keeps it's stainless shine. Love Love Love this set - looks great on the table!
5,Unique setting,My favorite everyday flatware. Unique design and substantial feel in the hand. These guys are built to last a lifetime of use.
2,Fragmented approach gets annoying,"Frankly, I do not like him, but I can see why others do. His jokes come at bite-sized portions, very strong one liners, and many of them are exceptionally good: ""I bought some batteries, but they were not included, so I had to buy them again.""However, monotonous rhytm and gloomy tone (supposed to enhance the comic effect) eventually got on my nerves. I agree he is a good comedian, I just do not care for his style."
5,comedy genius,"This has been around several years and if you like the low key humor of Steven then you will love it but most of you have heard this by now if you are a fan of Steven. If not, give it a try!"
5,Steven Wright has abilities no one else posesses.,"Steven Wrights comedy is so cerebral that any person, with a frontal lobe, should appreciate it. With classic jokes like, "" Last week I spilled spot remover on my dog..... Now I can't find him"" and ""I have the ability to levetate birds... but no one cares,"" everyone in the listening radius should be rolling on the ground. Steven Wright is a master of dead-pan and no one will ever superceed his prowess. Truly a perfect album for anyone who loves to laugh."
3,Basic Introduction to Dry Fire Practice,"A BASIC introduction to the concept of dry fire practice. Ideal for the person who has completed a few classes on handgun use and is wondering how they can improve their skills.As with any type of school work, every hour of instruction should be supplemented by several hours of study and practice to reinforce the techniques. Marksmanship, just like any other skill, is perishable and must be practiced on a regular basis."
5,Great poster,I'm a huge fan of the movie and the poster was not a disappointment. Looks great in my man cave. Price was more than fair.
3,It has its ups and downs,"As far as a book that gears you to applying statistics to the lab it does the job adequately. As far as explaining the theory of probability and statistics in a coherent way it leaves much to be desired. If I were a lab instructor I would probably use the book ""Introduction to Probability and Statistics"" by Milton and Arnold and just lecture on propagation of errors and the likewise."
5,Great Book,"I make measurements frequently and this book is great for providing the background to analyze your data.I took undergraduate level statistics and it never really gave the practical applied background in how to analyze data. It merely presented concepts and presumed you knew how and why to apply them. This book is very good at helping you to understand the how and why.I have read a number of other statistics book in search of the practical applied information provided in this book and did not find it in the other books.The writing is clear and consice. There is enough background provided for even those unexposed to statistics.I have not tried the software. Most of the formulas are easy to apply and can be implemented in simple programs or spreadsheets in very little time.In short, I recommend this book to anyone making measurements of any kind."
3,misprint and misleading!!,"There are lots of misleading in Ch. 3. - Specific error formulas. See the original Bevington's 1st ed., and compare the formulas. I think this misleading should be corrected. Standard deviation is ALWAYS positive!!.."
5,A classic returned!,Bevington's first edition of this book dates to the late 60's when Fortran ruled the world. I was crushed when I lost my copy in the mid 70's and am delighted to find he's written a modern updated edition!
3,Old Standard Marred by Terrible Editing,"This is a book that has been widely used by three generations of students and researchers. I used the 1969 edition as an undergraduate. The 2003 paperback edition would be an equally excellent publication except for the astounding number of editing errors in formulas and a few gross errors that seem to be outright mistakes. One particularly egregious error concerning multiplication of linear matrices appears in appendix B. I bought the text as a refresher and reference. Because I had a working knowledge of the subject matter, most of the errors were immediately evident. However, someone new to the subject would find many of them confusing.In My opinion, McGraw Hill has done a terrible disservice to the authors and should be embarrassed at doing such a poor job of publishing an otherwise excellent book."
5,Great Scripture Memory Songs,"Like the similar God's Grace CD, these songs are encouraging and calming. I love the fact that these songs helped me memorize Bible verses. This would make a great gift for someone who needs encouragement."
2,"Generic Dance Band, like in a hotel/reunion","Short of a few Euros at the time, Mr. Last trimmed his forces considerably on the theory that 1 organist equals 20 other musicians (?). Fidelity is OK, performance is generally that of any generic ensemble at a better dancehall, with emphasis on the beat so as not have dancers step on others' feet. plus 3 extra trumpets for those of hard of hearing but somewhat raspy for those of us with good ears. His genius shines through only occasionally here."
2,Wrong size!,"Never imagined iron rests came in different sizes. Our iron is too small for this rest.. we have managed to rig some aluminum foil to make it work, but would have preferred to know the size before purchase."
2,brief,"Probably too basic for those already interested in permaculture. This book is really more of a booklet, the type you can read in an hour. Be aware that it focuses on British issues."
5,Sexy & sweet,"This is just beautiful. Very moody. I love the cover of Dark Horse but 1st Kiss is definitely the track I can't stop singing in my head--I just hit repeat again and again on that one. The smooth, clear, musical tone of Mimi's voice is perfectly matched with lyrics that really hit home. I can identify with the words to every song on this album. Gorgeous music, too. Excellent all around!!"
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","I've been putting Dansk crystal glasses in my dishwasher for years which are not ""dishwasher safe"" with no problem. This glass is supposed to be dishwasher safe but is NOT. The minute I held it, I knew the glass was too light to be of good quality. It cracked after a week of use. Buyer Beware! Nice design but cheap glassware."
3,Pleasant introductory routine with instructional pauses,"This is a fairly nice introductory video, with nice instruction and reminders about form and breathing. It goes a little slow, with pauses and instructions in between some of the exercises (not all). Some of the exercises are very challenging. I've been working out for a solid month every day, and was not able to do a few of them, so beginners may have to skip or modify some exercises (or better yet...get a more appropriate beginners video). The instructors are encouraging but don't make many suggestions for modifications.Overall, an OK pilates video, but you can do better for both instructional quality (see instructor Ana Caban) or non-stop routines without pauses. I checked this one out from my local library, and after trying it out, I wouldn't buy it. Netflix does have this title available for rental."
2,My Least Favorite Pilates Video,"I have been practicing Pilates for two years and own eight Pilates videos. What I have enjoyed the most about Pilates is the serenity and fluidity that goes along with the teachings. If you have never tried Pilates you may like this tape however, if you have been accustomed to the quiet teachings and svelte instructors this video may not be to your liking. In my opinion this video lacks fluidity and concentration which are essential components in Pilates. Although the instructos do offer several movements I have never done I was afraid to bulk up like the instructors so I figured it was best for me to stay with my tried and true Pilates teachings."
4,"Liked the workout, not boring.","After doing the Windsor Pilates for about a year, I decided to try someone different. I have done Tracey York's workouts in the past and found them challenging but not impossible with repeat workouts. The presentation was slow at times but they can be fast forwarded. I really liked the workout and felt it was more targeted than the Windsor's. I will be trying some of the other workouts. Tracey and Michelle worked well together and taking turns made it easier to get to ""know"" both the instructors."
3,Too simplistic for many SAS users,"This book might be great for someone who has never used SAS before, and has also never used any kind of programming language at all.For just about everyone else, this book is simply too simple. I'm not a SAS guru by any means, but there was absolutely nothing in here that I hadn't already picked up in a few months of playing around with SAS.Two other books I'd recommend for peolpe who need any kind of depth would be ""Applied Statistics and the SAS Programming Language"" (by Cody and Smith) and ""SAS Applications Programming"" (by Dilorio)."
4,Decent book,"This book needs introductory knowledge of sas. The content borders on the edge though. It lacks on a couple of key points such as ODS, Macros and Proc Report which are very essential in a real-world situation. I read this book and the little sas book cover to cover. The little sas book would beat this to pulp. Definitely needs a revised edition."
4,Wow!,I am a cake decorator and I needed something to help me get my job done easier because standing and sifting flour with a crank sifter takes awhile. I didn't think that this would do the job because it was battery operated. But to my surprize that little motor is quite powerful. It can do all the flour you need and fast. It's great!
4,one design flaw,"This battery-operated sifter is deceptively compact - it holds a lot of flour. And the sifting is powerful. My only complaint is that the bottom is too wide. My previous battery-operated sifter had a funnel at the bottom which made it easy to direct the flour into a measuring cup. With this one, the flour goes way out beyond the cup. The wide bottom makes it possible for this one to stand up more securely, but I'd trade that for better aim."
1,Piece of junk,"I used this item twice and it quit working. Wasn't worth the money to send it back. Even when it did work, it didn't work very well. The motor was very weak."
2,wish I wasn't too lazy to busy it,"not a good product if you want to sift more than a 1/4 cup of flour. even a 1/2 cup seemed to heavy to let the device keep sifting, had to shake it out in the end. (boo)"
4,My second battery operated sifter.,I have not yet used my new sifter. It replaces one I had for 15 years and finally quit working. It appears to be much the same and I am glad they stil make this product. It si a snap when you need to sift a lot of four. I cannot wait to use it.
4,Christmas gift,Can't say yet because it was a gift and hasn't been used yet. It will surely make baking easier for the giftee.
1,Pourly made product,This was my second one. Received as gift but stopped working within a few months. I thought perhaps I had gotten water in it. The concept is wonderful for someone who has arthritis in hands. I ordered again - and it worked for about 1 min. Tried several different batteries - it is junk and not worth expense to ship back.
2,"Slow, smaller then advertised.",Would not recommend if you cook a lot.very slow to sift. Does not hold as much as it advertises.the only good thing is it is easy to clean.
4,Battery operated flour sifter,"I have arthritis in my hands. It's painful to squeeze on a manual flour sifter. This battery operated one works to perfection, just push the button and the rest is automatic. Great product."
3,Works just not the be all end all,I purchased this for my wife who does a lot of cakes. I thought it would save a bit of time and keep her hand from getting tired before she has to frost. It works as designed but if you fill the hopper all the way up it stops working. Seems to be because the motor is not that strong. Also this is far from fast compared to the hand crank version she has. So if you get this just understand that about half full will work well but is not fast and if you get clumps in the hopper the blades will not catch them like a manual version will.
4,Flour power,it is a little loud but gets the job done without making your arm tired like old school sifters.
5,Really Well Designed,"This item came to me as a gift, I'm an engineer and baker and I was amazed how well deigned and made it is.All components come apart for easy cleaning and this will take care of the problems some other reviews have had.It would be wonderful for older people, or anyone how want to sift more easily."
5,Pre-baking preparations have never been simpler!,"I bake a loaf of bread every couple of days, so to make life easier I put together my own bread kits in ten individual containers. Now sifting flour for ten containers (as a batch) can be very tedious, but with the Norpro Battery Operated Sifter it is unbelievably easy. Not only that, but it fits nicely into my containers so I don't have to worry about flour spilling out onto the bench. I'm so glad I bought this little beauty!"
1,Not Good,Do not waste your money!! I was very disappointed. The sifting is very slow and it takes much too long.
1,Not Recommended,"I have had two of these sifters, and they both quit working. While they were working they worked great at first, but got worse as time went on. The first one seemed to get bogged down if I added the 4 cups of confectioners' sugar I needed to sift, so I would reduce the quantity I added to the sifter at one time (which kind of defeats the purpose). Even after putting in a cup at a time, the motor just gave out after less than 10 total uses. I was so impressed with how it had worked at first, so I bought a second, determined to use only a cup of ingredient at a time so as not to stress the motor. Unfortunately, even with that, the second one didn't even last that long (maybe 3 uses). This product is a great idea, but I don't think the motor is powerful enough to do the job."
1,Ok but not durable,"I used the sifter very lightly and it still did not last beyond a year. While it worked, it did a decent a job of sifting, but it was loud and vibrated quite a bit. I also had a problem with the handle shocking me when I'd put it on or take it off. While I will continue to look for a good electric sifter, I would never purchase this one again."
4,Works good.,I wanted something to use for doing pie crusts and this works great. It's good to sprinkle powdered sugar also.
5,5 lb bag of flour in less than a minute!,"This is a sifter - big woo? Well let me tell everyone in the world - BIG WOW! My wife likes to make big loaves of Challah bread. It is oh-so-delicious on a Friday night. But the sifting (and I am the designated sifter in the family) is a pain in the rear. Usually 20 minutes of squeezing a lever, varrying hand positions, ugh. I had enough. Surely Amazon would have a solution, and sure enough, this is it! First time out of the box (and needing a C size battery) I sifted a 5 lb bag of flour in less than a minute. We were in shock - literally. It took a huge negative out of an otherwise awesome feel-good task. So, for anyone who hates the sifting process - it's time to modernize and get one of these bad boys!"
5,Battery Operated Sifter,I really like this sifter. It works great and isn't as messy (ingredients falling out from the sides where the crank and sifter bar per trued) as a traditional crank-style sifter. This sifter would be even better if it came with a lid(s)
3,"Plant & Page go ""acoustic""","Overall, this is a real good album. I like the ""marriage"" of Led Zep songs to middle eastern instruments & vocals. You do get a glimpse of Plant's changing voice...takes on a deeper timbre."
5,Page and Plant on top form,"This is an excelent cd i would recomend to anyone who likes zepplin, folk, blues or world music. The reworkings of zepplin tunes are fresh and demonstrate how a great tune can be reinterpeted. Of the now tunes Wonderfull one stands out as a touching ballad"
5,Brilliant as always!,"What made LedZep great was their unique style and experimentation.Page and Plant have continued the saga in ""No Quater"".A wonderful CD to have in any collection."
5,"Breathtaking guitar, honest vocals!","Thank You has the most incredible guitar work I've heard from Page, & anyone else for that matter, in a long time! This is a must have for Zep fans and rock quitarists worldwide! Like the Stones, I hope they just keep on going & going & going...."
5,Awesome!,"If you love Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, you will love this DVD they did back in 94 for MTV. Unreal! I wish I could have been there in the MTV studio to see them play!"
4,Page and Plant together again!,"In 1994 Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and Robert Plant got together again.Since Zeppelin had broken up in 1980 after John Bonham passed away, fans were ready for some form of Zeppelin, although they had played a few shows together in the 80's,for example Live Aid in 1985 with Phil Collins playing the drums. While not as good as it would be to have the three surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunite No Quarter should satisfy many fans who are wanting Zeppelin again.Unledded contains 13 songs performed live at various shows in the U.K. While the set doesn't contain that many of the songs that pop into your head when you think of Led Zeppelin Unledded is a very good album. All of the songs sound good they way they are performed here.If you love Zeppelin buy this CD."
3,Good not great,Some nice tunes here. Title track is a mess and I remixed this album on itunes for better running order.
5,amazing music,"this album is amazing meterial, Page & Plant are awesome together as always, it's like they never left. Very majestic and wonderful, this album rocks and then some!"
2,This A Broken Record - Buy The Real Zeppelin!,"I am a diehard Led Zeppelin, but I was sadly disappointed with this CD. Plant And Page obviously don't have any originality left after 20 years, if all they can do is churn out altered copies of their best work. Their peers, such as John Paul Jones and Jeff Beck, meanwhile, are producing inspired, creative, exciting works, which leave these two in the dust! Robert Plant and Jimmy Page were part of a fantastic band that broke large boundaries, but on this CD they are content to sit on that fence!"
2,A big deception,"I like Led Zep a lot, also, I like Robert Plant as a solo artist.I was surprised by the Coverdale Page album,I like it a lot.I had big expectation for this one, Page and Plant again together...It was a big deception. I don,t like the new songs, ""No Quarter"" is horrible, what a disaster ! I'll give my cd to somebody who, I hope, will like it."
1,For the Love of All that is HOLY !!!,"We all know the music, the mix, song swaps, blah blah blah... WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE COVER COLORS ??? That beautiful warm sepia on the original PERFECTLY fit the age and vintage of our boys! RED ?!?! What is this?!? Graphics 101 at Christmas time ?!? oh - eye catching color - must have... grunt ... These guys are my heroes... clearly, I'm upset... Hey, Presence was a poor seller - let's red-wash it now too .... UGH"
3,"Led Zeppelin fans must have, others maybe.","As a Led Zeppelin fan of many years who has always been more interested in the music than the mystique of the band, let me say that this album is worth buying for its version of ""Kashmir"" alone. Unfortunately, it may be the only reason. I personally don't feel that the new songs are worth much and, while most of the Led Zeppelin covers are interesting, especially ""Nobody's Fault But Mine,"" they pale in comparison to the originals. And, sad to say, Plant appears to be straining to hit notes that he once reached so effortlessly. I have never understood why ""Kashmir"" was such a popular and beloved Zeppelin song. Not that I didn't like it, or anything. I just didn't think it was great. Now, thanks to this version, I do. Nuf said."
5,Just As I Remembered It,"If you loved this CD when it first came out, who can remember the year anymore, must have been in the early 90s, you'll love it again now that you finally remembered the name of it. I couldn't locate it in any of my local record stores or Best Buy, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. Brought back memories of seeing Page/Plant in concert. I like this version of Gallows Pole much better than the one on the box set, which I also purchased."
4,music,liked most of the songs. some are ok. page and plant can make some pretty good music togeither. for music lovers
2,Poor quality compared to original,"While I applaud Tokyopop for offering an American edition illustration collection, the quality is very poor when compared to the original Japanese edition. The illustrations are blurry and the reproduced B&W illustrations in the comments and how to section look like low quality photocopies. The paper used is also very poor, similar to magazine quality.I could only recommend this book is you can't find the original out of print version, which is fairly easy to find used on auction sites and used Japanese used bookstores."
2,Not the best CD of all the volumes,"Well, this volume of Cafe Del Mar is pretty bad, the only good songs are:Jose Padilla - Que BonitoJohn Martyn - Sunshines BetterChicane - Offshore (Ambient Mix)Karen Ramirez - Troubled Girl (Spanish Version)If you can only afford one CD, I will recommend ""Cafe Del Mar Volume 9 or Volume 8"", but not this one."
4,Great show of American expressionism!,"Having taught this play a number of times at the college level, I find it one of the most accessable examples of expressionism available in print. It's great to read while watching a film like Metropolis (Fritz Lang's expressionist masterpiece). In reference to an earlier review, the play may seem simple and mundane, but when read in its historical context (and when seen in a brave production) it's what theatre is all about... engaging, moving, and socially/politically active. The fact that it's by a woman and about a woman, in a period dominated by the male perspective, simply makes it more fascinating."
3,Decent,This book had much more writing in it that the seller listed. The writing was messy notes that took up the entire front and back pages.
4,Intriguing and different play,What an interesting play! Somewhat of a feminist play is only because the woman wants to be set free from her husband. She finally gets free but you'll have to read it to see how!
2,Creepy weird... it's not Wild Things,"Sendak is an aquired taste. This one and Higglety Pigglety Pop are his most ""stout"" of books, IMHO. Sendak's books are genius, but not for every kid or every adult (heck, we have to enjoy them, too).I will admit, I think my 4 year old daughter has more patience for this book than I do. She is a new big sister to twins. She get's this book, maybe because she is into fantasy play in pre-school and doesn't have to get up and go to work every morning."
1,Yikes!,"We borrowed this book from the library because of the joy we find in reading ""Where the Wild Things Are"", and assume this book would have the same kind of childhood imagination, and also the fact that it received an award. Yikes! If this is childhood imaginagtion, maybe the makers of horror films should use kids for inspiration. This book made my son afraid that goblins would steal him away in the night, and that babies might be goblins. The father is absentee, the mother distant, and the big sister has to care for her baby sister. Goblins steal the baby away, and the big sister is able to retreive her through some drug-trip-like ritual. Meanwhile, dad's away and mom's staring off into space in the garden.Don't read this to your toddler/preschooler/school-age/tween/teen-age kids!!!"
4,Great book!,"Ida must watch her baby sister while her father is away at sea and her mother is in the arbor. However, she doesn't watch closely enough and goblins pull her baby sister out the window and plan to make her a goblin bride. Can Ida save her sister?Oddly enough, the book isn't as disturbing as it sounds. It reminds me of traditional fairy tales told with the intent to make children behave through fear. Ida learns an important lesson, keep both eyes on the baby.The illustrations depict intense emotions and help the reader to comprehend the somewhat limited text.Not my favorite Sendak work, but certainly a great one worth reading."
4,Book review,"At face value, this book seems like it would scare any child that it is read to. However, it teaches an important lesson in how to use one's own skills and knowledge to overcome a scary obstacle."
5,My daughters' favorite book of all time,"Both of my daughters were enchanted by this book. We got it when they were 2 & 3 years old. Children have rich imaginations and rather than being frightened (as some reviewers thought children might be) they felt empowered by the story. Parents are not always around when you're faced with a frightening situation. Ida was able to save her baby sister and return her to the garden because she listened to and acted on the internalized teachings of her father. And in the end, the goblins turned out to be ""just babies, like her sister."" All was well.While pre-schoolers may not have been able to explain this allegory, they understand it on a deep and personal level. In their late 20s now, my daughters still love this book."
5,An outstanding bedtime book for my 3 year old & I!,"My daughter and I read this book 4 to 5 times a day. She is captivated by the baby goblins and feels very strongly about Ida, and how she searches for her sister. She has pretty much memorized the book and I hear her walking through the house singing softly about Ida & how much her PaPa loves her. I highly recommend this book to any parent for their child."
2,another Sendak dissapointment,"I want so much to love this author. His illustrations are wonderful. This story bored my 4 year old and left me unintrigued. I have no idea to whom this book should appeal. Much like ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" the story is over-rated and uninspired. Sendak should have left the writing to others."
2,Not Appropriate for Young Children,"Although Maurice Sendak is a well-known author for WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, this book, OUTSIDE OVER THERE, in my opinion, is not appropriate for young children. Not only are the words difficult for a young child to understand in its old world poetic style, but the illustrations could easily spook a child into having nightmares. Any parent out there wanting to stay up all night? If your child enjoys the rush of being scared and you are willing to explain the spirit world with each turning page to your child, then OUTSIDE OVER THERE may be a good book for discussion in regards to kidnapping and such. I, for one, will not be reading it to my family."
5,Greak Sendak Book,The book was exactly what I was looking for. It is in pristine condition and is a magical read. My granddaughters delight in it!
5,Great game for my 6 yr old!,"My 1st reaction to this game was not that good. I thought it was going to be too much for my 6 yr old. The dog learn it's name & tricks by voice commands & to earn money you have to train them to enter & win contests. But once we got the game set up & going my daughter loves, loves this game. This is the game she ended playing the most. My husband & I even enjoy playing this game too. YOu can buy up to 8 puppies. You feed, walk, bath, & train them. Overall it is a great game once you learn how to navigate it."
3,Playing with Puppy,"Great game for an animal lover who for whatever reason can't have a real-life dog at the moment.Playing, feeding and training the puppies are very fun, and very addictive.However, its not exactly a game to keep you entertained for a long stretch at a time."
4,A Hit With My Granddaughter,My 11 year old granddaughter has really enjoyed this game. She asked for it specifically so that made my purchase easy! I liked the price that Amazon listed it for!
4,Good game but disappointed mom,"I bought this for my 9 1/2 year old daughter. She really likes the game but still hasn't really ""gotten used to it"". Overall it is a really great game but there seems to be a steep learning curve at the beginning for figuring out how to ""reward"" the dog. From my standpoint, I wish I had bought another game because I don't see that she is learning much, at least so far."
5,BUT IT ALREADY!!!!!!,"i have the dacshund version of the game and it's the coolest!!! the best by far is the touch screen and microphone (when it works) the dogs are incredibly life-like and very different to each other. My personal favourites are the chihuahuas, (i got my friend to send them to me via wireless conection)it really is a very very good game and it probably best to play in short bursts."
4,Not much excitement for 11yr old,"My daughter received this for xmas. She loves it and plays with it occasionally, but after about 15 minutes she gets bored and moves on to another game. She'll go right back to it the next day, but usually only for another 15 minutes or so. It's really cute, but probably better for younger children."
5,Nintendogs give your child great confidence!,"I am so glad I bought Nintendogs for my son for his birthday. He has the challenges of Autism and can not beat many games. Therefore he can be highly frustrated. This game is a real pleaser, he has found a friend in his dog and feels great about his achievements. It is most pleasurable to see him smile as he plays this game!"
5,"Nintendogs, Good for all ages","Nintendogs are the most fantabulous simulation, game whatever it is, in my life. Pick from a variety of breeds of dog, teach it tricks and play with it, feed it, groom it, anything! Nintendogs are the most loveable and enjoyable game in the world. But remember, neglect your pups too much and they might run away for a short time! So keep remembering to attend to ALL your dogs. Go to the website and onto bark park. Where you can learn more about tricks, what accessories, care products and toys are there in the game. There are over 200 items to collect for your dog. Remember, BUY NINTENDOGS NOW, AND YOU WON'T BE LONELY EVER AGAIN!"
5,Virtual pets rock!! Especially cuz theres a microphone,"My friend has this game and it ROCKS! I think virtual pets are cool. Pardon my language but for those idiots out there who thinks this will come out on PSP, PLEASE! Get your heads in gear people. NINTENDOgs, Sony and Nintendo are rivals for petes sake! Besides sony doesnt have ""cute and cuddly"" fun games like that. Well, have fun with this game! :)"
1,More work than a real dog,"When they say it's just like having your own dog, they mean it! I was very excited to get this game for my 6 year old daughter. Turns out, neither one of us have the patience to train a dog over and over again before even getting the opportunity to do anything fun. I have decided this game is pure torture much like my experience training my own dogs. Perhaps an extremely lonely person or an extremely bored person or a dog fanatic may enjoy this kind of repetitive nonsense but it's not for us. We just want to play a game for fun, not get stuck repeating the name ""Fido"" over and over and over.... ahh!"
5,get this,first of all who is the retart with wait for the psp version. How are the going to call NINTENDOgs PSPdogs. this kid is such a friging loser. And go donate ur money to the red cross. Yes do that go buy a ds for 129.99 and donate the extra 120 dollars from not buying the psp to charity. 120 is alot better that 35. Dont u think?? Anyway game + exremely fun. Must have get it now before the holiday rush!games to get1.nintendogs2.mario kart ds3.Wario touched4.animal crossing5.Ds WI-FI kit
5,I love it,I love this game.I have the toy poodle and she is SO cute.It is a really fun game.You have to feed it and give it water bathe it.You can go on walks and enter contests.
4,What Ninetendogs includes:,"I absolutly love Ninetdogs! You can walk them, play with them, pet them, feed them, dress them, and more! You are so free when you play this game! It also has a saving button so that before you shut off the game you can save the changes made. I definately would not reccomond this game to non-dog lovers! You get to choose from a variety of breeds and colors. You can also enter contests and find other dogs on walks. The bad thing though is the name is limited only to 7 letters so when you choose the name it can't be more than 7 letters. Also training takes a little while but after that it is filled with excitement and love for your new dog!"
5,Great way to relax,"The dogs are adorable and i love figuring out what contest they're best at, taking them on walks and just petting them. but it's not a game you can play for that long of a time. I love playing it when i'm a little stressed and then i just get hooked and can't put it down. This is a really great game especially for younger players. They'll love the amazing graphics of adorable dogs and how easy things are to do. In all this is a great game!"
5,My kids love this game,"I got this game for my son, who is 8. He and my 10 year old daughter love it."
5,Little Too Easy...,"Don't take me wrong, the game is great. Only thing is, it's so easy to train. I have a real golden retriever at home that is several hundred times harder to train than the virtual one, and my dog's one of the ""smarter"" dogs. If the producers made it a bit harder to train, it'd probably be more tedious yet more realistic. Otherwise, it's a really fun game. Recommend for DS players."
5,smart dog,"Nintendodogs is so cool!Although i don't have it, i'm a fan. It looks so cool. And it's like having your own dog. I think it's great for kids who want dogs but can't have one. i think it's very educational and i hope parents will buy it for kids"
2,On Time... but different product.,"I bought this game for my sister so she could complete her Nintendogs collection. I received the game only a few days after I ordered it, which was great! The box for the game said Lab and Friends on it, so I texted my sister telling her it was here, only to open it and find a completely different game. This seller is definitely time efficient, but make sure they check their products before they sell them to you."
1,Wait for the PSP version ---> PSP version = much better,"My recommendation is for people to wait for the PSP version of Nintendogs, Sony's going to release its own version of Nintendogs sometime in the spring (under a different name, complete with a touchpad USB attachment). The Sony version has been getting rave reviews from the Japanese press.Save your money, don't get the Nintendo version of this game instead WAIT FOR THE PSP VERSION (coming out in late spring 2006)."
1,OO I LOVE NINTENDOGS!,THOSE DOGS ARE SO CUDDILY WUGGILY!!! WOW I CANT WAIT TO SHOW MY MOMMY! I WISH ALL 5 YEAR OLDS OUT THERE HAD THIS TOY!
1,mean commercial,"The commercial about the girl and the teddy bear was just unacceptable. The girl was saying to the bear stuff like ""I hate you because I have a nintendog!"" and ""My virtual dog loves me, UNLIKE YOU!!"" This is wrong. We have many wonderful REAL dogs out there, and are we doing the right thing by ditching them for a fake dog that does not exist and does not love us and play with us and be a good friend to us? I don't think so."
3,la la la cooka cha cha,"hello. if you didn't already know, my name is leonerd (for short) When I purchesed this game, i thought will my dogs have babies, because somehoow babies are made, but I dont yet know how. Once I sold a dog keychain to my friend muarice. He said he would buy nintendogs when it came out, but that was like six years ago, so how he knew about it i do not know. Maybe he's a psychic. This game about dogs called nintendogs or something like that is very interesting. Did you know that some deformed dogs have three tails? Overall I would give this game a ritde out of fetre. I think thats how you spell it. Thanks for reading."
1,It is a little weird....,"Ok, my daughter wanted this game really bad for Christmas, and she got it.. but... she hasnt been able to play it! I dont know if she is doing something wrong, I tried myself and couldnt get it to work either. I might have to call Nintendo and ask. We can't pass the level where we name the dog. We have to say the dog's name into the microphone to register the name, but after many many tries, it doesnt recognize it or something and we just can't pass the level. I am really not able to review it as we havent been able to play it. I dont know if we are doing something wrong or there is a problem with the game, but my next step is to call Nintendo."
3,I Bet Nintendogs Is Coming out on PsP,"I bet that nintendogs is coming out on PSP because all companies are huge moneymaking scams. Nintendo will make a contract to the PSP companies and Nintendo will get loads and loads of money. I bet it will come out in a year or so. I actually think that they are working on it as I write this. Since nintendogs is so popular, they're probably thinking, ""Hmmmmm, you know, since Nintendogs is so popular, we should sell it for millions and millions of dollars and ask for 50% interest"". I admit, I might be getting psp soon, and I bet the graphics will be much, much better."
1,Pointless,"This game is totally lame. All you do is raise a puppy to run around and compete in lame contests. I played my friend's. To that person who said it got boring after the first day or two, I envy you. I got bored after the first 5 minutes! Don't go for this game."
5,Doggy Fun,"Nintendogs is a great game for anyone who loves dogs. Expecially for kids whose parents won't let them have a pet. They sit, lie down, and listen to all of your commands. They even go on walks with you. You can enter them in contests to win money in order to buy new houses and supplies. Overall this is a great game."
1,Perfect game for someone in solitary confinement,"We got this game for my 5 year old daughter. She loves dogs, but my wife is allergic to anything with fur. I don't know how far we got with getting the dog to recognize his name, but my daughter probably repeated the name, ""MAX"" a hundred times. I told her that it might take a couple hundred times. The game was able to maintain her interest (and my interest) for about five minutes. I've read some of these reviews and there must be some really patient people who have the time to repeat the same thing three hundred times at an electric gadget and imagine that it's the real thing. This would be the perfect gift for the following people: someone in prison, someone working at a toll booth, or a lighthouse keeper."
3,ok,This game was not as much fun As I thought it would be. The dog does not learn tricks very fast. And you wait and wait and wait for the dog to do somthing new!! It just disapointing.
3,It's not very good,"When I first bought it it was awesome, but later on in the game the graphics get REALLY bad and its just plum not worth the 30 or 25 dollars."
5,Nintendogs Rule,"I may have already sent a review about Nintendogs but i just love them. People who do NOT like Nintendogs are totally RUBBISH!I never stay off the website, there you can go onto bark park, and find out about all the care products, toys, accessories and loads of stuff in the game. If you go into the library, you can find out how to make your dog roll over and chase its tail at the same time, and do other amazing tricks. Also learn about trainer points and general things in the library. I AM TELLING YOU THIS GAME IS ABSALOTELY GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT. 100 stars i would give it. Please whoever reads this, i hope this gains your confidence."
5,OK I love this game but it's not coming out on PSP!!,"OK this game is awesome!! and it's not coming out on PSP why.... because then u couldn't pet your dog, feed it, walk, it and play with it cause u need a touch screen and a stylus to do that!!! So don't wait cause it's not coming out on PSP so don't even wait cause then u couldn't do what is listed above!! So if u have a DS and $30 dollars then go out and buy it! I love it!! P.S. again it's not coming out on PSP cause u couldn't do what u can do with it on DS!! IT'S NOT COMING OUT ON PSP PEOPLE!!"
1,i 'D RATHER BANG MY HEAD AGAINST THE Wall,I bought this game for my daughter who is 10. She was so frustrated with the game . I do not recommend this game for any age child. It is too frustrating. It is not fun or enjoyable for anyone. I wish I had known this before I had purchased this game for my child.It would have saved me a lot of aggravation.
2,Warning: No Way Out! Guilt on a Game Card,"My kids liked this at first. Now they play purely out of guilt. Once you've taken on a dog, you have no choice but to walk and feed it every day. Sure, if you have more than one dog you can board the extras indefinitely at the dog hotel. But you have to keep one, and feel like a bad person if you don't feed it and walk it.Honestly, think twice before subjecting your children to that!"
4,So fun!,"Nintendogs is such a fun game. Keep in mind, I'm not as young as most who probably play this game, but I still have a blast playing!! Start by choosing the dog of your choice - there are so many to choose from, each with their own individual personality, so the perfect puppy is always waiting for you. If you already have a REAL dog, it's fun looking for a dog in this game that matches your real pet! Teach them all kinds of tricks, participate in competitions, groom, and play with your new puppy, just as a real pet! Accessories are also available, like sunglasses, hats, and neat collars for your puppy.For any parent with children who are interested in having their own pet, this is GREAT practice for them! And parents may even enjoy it, too!"
5,GREAT GAME!,mY 9 YEAR OLD SON REALLY ENJOYED THIS GAME ALONG WITH THE OTHER KIDS IN MY HOUSE AGES 17 AND 16. i AS AN ADULT LIKED PLAYING IT TOO.
5,Delivers,"Excellent look at the question of ""Nature Versus Nurture In Human Behavior"", assuming you like getting facts and percentages from good quantitative studies, and you'd also like to know why the studies were good, and you don't want any speculative unified theories. It rambles off the point from time to time, though I found it rambles fairly engagingly myself. My favorite item in the book is about schizophrenia in identical twins. If one identical twin has it, the chances the other has it are around 1 in 3. When one with and one without the disease are looked at with magnetic resonance imaging it can be seen that their brains are significantly different in structure and function."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This CD is a joke and, most likely, not legally licensed, since the true rights holders name does not appear anywhere. Furthermore, it is in mono sound, mastered off an LP. It's amazing what people think they can get away with. This score will finally be released in a few weeks, properly licensed, from the original album masters, in both French and English versions. That's the one you want - and in stereo, as it should be."
4,C'est la vie,This is the original soundtrack alright but it's NOT digitally re-mastered despite the high price tag. Thought Japanese companies were meticulous about sound quality hence not checking it...c'est la vie..
5,Bienvenu!,I play this CD in my car. I love listening to the sounds of French words. The melodies are beautiful. This is mood music from the nation that celebrates romance. The album is well worth the price. I have no regrets.
1,Mono and bad,"I'm not sure if people ""reviewing"" here are just totally without knowledge or whether they're just so happy to get certain music they don't care. This pricey import from Japan, like the other ""import"" that's available is not mastered from any first generation tapes - and it's mono where it should be stereo. For those who love this music, it's going to receive its first proper release ever on CD - in stereo from the original album masters."
1,A rather forgotten character should have remained forgotten,Grant Morrison takes a hard fall with this latest revamp of the obscure character Kid Eternity. After reading the book I was left with the bitter taste of incredulity. Kid Eternity fails to deliver the delightful wit that JLA and X-men espoused. The plot seems insincere and stifled. Fegredo's work is tedious doing little to breathe any life into this dying work.
2,Poor quality Lyre Harp,This Lyre harp is of very poor quality. I expected much better for the price. It looks like a third grader quickly slapped it together and shipped it off.
4,a fun intro to the history of photography,"This is a cute, little book with fun, interesting facts on the history of photography. It gives a nice overview on a variety of topics from the beginning of photography to present. It is by no means a comprehensive history book and it's not a how to book, but if you would like a quick background on photography's beginning, this does it. If you are looking for a comprehensive history text, go elsewhere, spend more and get a much larger book. I have taught photo-history and like the quick, easy-to-read, fun insight. It's a good book for those looking for an intro to the history of photography."
2,Not for motorcycle use,"I used this locking carabiner for two trips on my motorcycle. It didn't survive a third trip, you get what you pay for.The tumblers inside gave up the ghost, they are made out of plastic and the vibration from a single cylinder engine was too much for it."
1,"5 minutes of test, then into the garbage","It took a few squirts of WD-40 just to make the (disengagement) button 'move'. Then, as I had an instinct that this unit was junk, I tested the opening/closing mechanism WITHOUT attaching it to the item I needed to 'lock'. On about the 10th lock/open cycle, the lock 'froze' in the locked position. Nothing I could do would make it open. Fortunately I trusted my instincts to test it a few times BEFORE locking-up the item I needed to secure. That saved me a lot of grief, and all I had to do, then, was toss this unit into the trash."
5,Steller Scientific Detective Story,"In addition to being a great example of a naturalist at work, it is a stellar example of a great scientist showing the challenges and rewards of proper use of the scientific method. Highly recommended."
3,Not the best for modifications...,"The box was alright. I needed something small and cheap to house a speaker and amplifier. This material was a little tough to work with (drilling holes, etc...), but I guess that was expected because it is pretty thin. It would be great for just storing things, however.So if you plan on modifying it, be careful and you should be fine, otherwise it's a pretty good product."
5,AWESOME,"I bought this item for my daughter and she loved it! The shipping is awesome with Amazon and I can always track my purchases. She did not get this as a christmas gift so when I seen the price how could I pass it up. Thanks Amazon, keep doing what you do!"
3,When is it released?,I have looked just about every where and I can not find the date that season 8 will be released on DVD. Can anyone help me out?
3,Bad DVD quality,"I purchased this show for my wife because she missed this season. I noticed that when she was watching it that the picture was blurry kind of like a burned DVD that has been compressed. I know it is not my DVD player or TV because I watch other DVD's with a great picture. Don't know if all the sets are like this or if its just the one I purchased.Almost forgot to mention, this is one of the worst television series ever made! But, my wife likes it so 3 stars."
2,Seriously?,"I'd rate it 4 stars for the season, but really? $53 for this set? When the other sets run from $22-$30! What greed! Guess I'll be looking for a used copy..."
5,Love!,Such a great series. One you can watch over and over again. One you must own! I love love love it!
5,A must-have for OTH collectors,"Most people don't love this season of One Tree Hill, but I do! Yes, Lucas and Peyton are missing, and it shows, but Brooke finds true love, and Nathan and Haley grow into a great, mature couple."
4,Love this show!,I have loved this show for many years. I missed it on tv one night and had to get caught up before the following week.
3,Scratched Disk,All of the disks in this set skipped because of scratches. Sometimes it even skipped whole scenes in the episodes.
5,my son gives it 5 stars and i give it 4 1/2 stars.,"this is one of the thomas videos that we almost agree on--it is a very good video, with lots of different messages (cooperation, sharing, working together, be good to your word, etc.) and it is far less annoying to listen to than some other tapes... george carlin does a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life; henry's forest is a particularly poignant tale. the one complaint i have about this and really all the thomas tapes is that there is no positive female character in the entire series: mavis is young and doesn't listen to anyone; annie and clarabel complain and worry too much; caroline complains and doesn't like to work; lady doesn't talk but is just pretty; and old slow coach is, well, old and retired; etc. in this video, this particular aspect seems especially obvious to me, but probably not to 3 to 6 year olds."
4,misunderstood,"are these people serious???!!! this is one of the best AND most underated albums of the last few years. this band is not trying to stick to any 'roots' especially not post hardcore, or screamo... they write what they want to. and why wouldn't they, they are all still teenagers!!! this is rock music and even though it's their first full length, this is a great album and these amazon users seem to have the wrong idea of this band."
3,"Missing the lead ins, instrumentals, and break downs from earlier releases","Their two previous 5 track releases have a couple things that make it stand out that this album completely lacks.The first thing is lead ins. Of their 10 previously released songs, most of them have instrumental lead ins that last an average of 55 seconds.The second thing is break downs. In their first 2 EPs there are plenty of ""breaks"" mid song, where they highlight, emphasize and exagerate the best parts of the tune.The lead ins and break downs I just mentioned offer huge variety in every song, making it very easy to listen to over and over again.Lightworker is missing both. Too many of these songs are redundant. They do sound good, but it's like listening to a 15 second clip looped over. It becomes a stale listen, fast.Make sure you own their first two five track releases. If they're touring near you, go to a show (wear ear plugs). Treasure what they've got out that you like, and hope for another album."
2,New Yesterdays Rising,"The style has totally changed from there last few ep,s. There older stuff is the true definition of post hardcore and i could listen to it all day long. If your into rock that is a little calmer and maybe easier to listen to then it is a good album. The music is not that bad its just the style has totally changed and it doesnt even sound like yesterdays rising. I think it would have gotten better reviews with a different band name. This new album sounds like emery, kinda mellow with very little screaming and mellow vocals. The only reason i give it two stars is because its just not yesterdays rising."
1,Yesterdays Rising Is God awful,"I live in Murrieta. I Grew up with brandon... God this album was horrible. I was even high when i herd it. God it sucked. Please Brandon Bolmer Stop sucking and shoot yourself in the head. I should have stabbed you on the bus when i had the chance you no talent hack. I hate this band. Despise. I know that kids are making a big deal over nothing. Watch, next year they wont even be around Screw Yesterdays Rising. Screw Brandon Bolbmer."
1,BMW owners be advised,"I read a lot of reviews and even checked this product out on Youtube. It sounded pretty good, so I purchased one container of Blue Job Chrome Polish and 2 packages of Blue Job Pipes Wipes. The total cost was $24.50 (pricey), but the promise of having shinny pipes on my BMW R1150R was worth it. When I opened the container, I was immediately taken back by the small amount of polish sitting in the bottom this oversized container. The container could have been a fraction of its size and still have held the polish. I followed the directions and even used an orbital sander with the pipe wipes as instructed on Youtube. I was expecting to have enough Polish to do both pipes, but I ran out before I was done. The pipes looked better, but not $24.50 better. After riding my bike, my pipes were blued again. I have seen a lot of BMW motorcycles with blued pipes. Due to a lot of good reviews, I suspect that bluing pipes are inherent to BMW pipes on boxer engines."
4,"Good product, gets rid of the gold","Bought this product to remove some moderate golding on the first 8 to 12 inches of one exhaust pipe. Following instructions provided with the product, it took about 30 minutes of elbow greese and the golding was gone."
1,Why don't they let you give NO stars?,HORRIBLE product. Complete waste of money. Didn't do anything they claim it does. My pipes don't look any better than they did before. Save yourself some money and buy the stuff at the dollar store for a buck; will do just as much as this expensive stuff.
1,Blue Job is a b**w job,"Read several reviews of Blue Job online - some positive, some negative - and thought I'd give it a try on my 2007 Triumph America with deeply blued pipes. What a disappointment. After a lot of work (including using a power buffer) I noticed a minimal effect. Not worth the time, effort, or money. Bottom line - got blue pipes? Don't let them make you blue, too. Learn to live with it."
3,OK,"When they say it needs a lot of rubbing, they shoud have underscored ""lot"". After a LOT of rubbing, the blue starts to fade, then turns yellow, then that starts to fade, then another color emerges that's much lighter, then you just get tired! Also, the quantity they send makes it look like a controlled substance."
5,It works.,"After I watched the videos on youtube I bought a jar. I was glad I saw the video, made it much easier. PipeBlue Job Chrome Polish .5 ozstayed clean about a year until this November I was sitting at a stoplight, choke on, blue came back. Strange, but it came off much easier the second time I blued it."
4,Gets rid of the blue...temporarily,"Well this stuff works on the wierd blue color that comes from your pipes getting too hot, but it wont last, the only way to fix the problem is getting your pipes re-cromed. It happens because your pipes aren't thick enough. but its done a good enough job to fix temporarily, much cheaper and easier to do once a year or so, than getting your pipes re-chromed."
4,OK World Music,"I was hoping for something refreshing but the songs on this cd sound like synthetic versions of everything else out there. It's not a bad cd, it's enjoyable, just not what I expected."
5,What Defines a Great Storyteller?,"Anyone can tell (or write) a story. The real trick is all about engaging the listener or the reader...grabbing hold of them in such a way that they set aside the hustle and bustle of their lives and become engrossed in the story. This is the storytelling skill Petrakis has demonstrated throughout his long and illustrious career. Tales of the Heart exhibits all of Petrakis' power as a storyteller, but it goes much farther. When I was young, my dad, an educator, used to stop every once and a while, in the midst of some thankless task, glance sideways at me, and say: ""This counts."" He wanted me to understand that we were engaged in something bigger. Tales of the Heart points us all toward something bigger.Petrakis, whether writing fiction or essays, or whether delivering a public address, is one of my favorite storytellers. Tales of the Heart provides an inspiring look into the heart of a superb writer, the likes of which may never pass this way again."
4,Get off the unicorn,Good short stories for bedtime. I do prefer McCaffrey's full length novels. Quiet an imagination from this lady. I do hope that Todd will carry on in the writing style of his mother.
5,JUST AWESOME!,This book is a must for any professional groomer. It has tons of information and pictures of common and uncommon breeds. I gave it 5 stars because it truly surpassed my expectations. I think Notes from the Grooming Table is without a doubt worth the extra money. I would recomend this book to all professional groomers.
5,Love It!!!,"This is the BEST grooming book I have ever owned! A must have for any groomer...whether just learning or been grooming for years. This is my grooming ""bible""!!!"
3,"Prettier package, same standard advice.","This was a book I was SO eager to get. It is absoultely ok, but it sure wasn't the masterpiece that I had hoped for. It is pretty with excellent layout and clever spiral binding, but it is just the same advice as you get anywhere.Still, this is probably one of the first books I'd recommend on the subject to a beginner. But if you are more advanced in the field there will be little new to gain."
2,Comprehensive and dated,"Tolbert's book is comprehensive and does a good job of overviewing Baptist groups in Europe and North America. The book is dated and does not include any of the important developments among American (Northern) Baptists and Southern Baptists of the past 25 years.Tolbert seems to write from a northern perspective and seems to view Southern Baptist history from a distance fueled by a distaste for the American South and a lack of understanding of the deep role Southern culture has among Southern Baptists.Difficult to read and unnecessarily repetitious in his history, Tolbert's is still a standard in Baptist history. Though Leon McBeth's history is more readable, it is also much more liberal in its leanings and transparent in his opinions and perspectives, hurting the contribution in his monumental work. Thus, Tolbert remains the standard in Baptist history."
2,NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I ORDERED,"Performance Accessories 152 3"" Body Lift Kit Chevy S Series Blazer / Gmc Jimmy 98-03I ORDERED THIS KIT AND GOT A 2"" BODY LIFT KIT AND NOT THE 3"" SO I RETURNED IT!!!THEN I RECIEVED A REPLACEMENT KIT AND IT WAS ANOTHER 2"" LIFT NOT MY 3"" KIT, VERY UPSETTING CONSIDERING I HAD A SHOP LINED OUT & RENTED TO INSTALL THIS WEEKEND BUT THEY DID GET ME ANOTHER 2"" KIT QUICK BUT IM STILL WAITING FOR MY 3"" BODY LIFT KIT"
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I used the blade in my 5hp lift tilt saw and it didn't slow down or have any issues with any kind of wood I'd use from mahogany plywood to 8/4 ash but that could be the saw and not the blade. It sells itself as a do-it-all blade which it can do but not as well as a blade designed for that task. My 40 tooth ripping blade rips better than this one. My 60 tooth Hi-ATB cross cuts better than this one. Other reviews have said that the teeth break off and if I didn't see it happen with my own eyes I wouldn't believe it. A tooth broke off right at the braze point. I think there are quite a few quality issues with this blade.If you can only have 1 blade, this one will do it for you but I'd rather spend a little more and get 2 blades that do their job better than this one and keep their teeth."
2,Burn baby burn,"Ditto other reviews, this blade burns hard maple on both sides of cut. Switched to an Infinity combo max and am now getting flawless cuts. Reserve this blade for softwoods or particle board."
5,Advidwooder,I am very pleased with this saw blade. It meets my expectations for an excellent precision general blade. It is my standard used blade on all projects. Freud provides customer satisfaction again.
1,"Ok, so you looked at this blade now go buy the Forrest WW10407125","I am so sorry I bought this blade before I bought a Forest. It leaves black smears on oak and maple stock. And they are glass hard. One smear was so bad, I ruined my piece sanding the black out.Forest makes the best. There now I said it too."
2,Poor quality teeth,"I borrowed one of these from a friend to try it out and compare to my WW2. I noticed a couple of tiny chips on some of the teeth, but tried it and it still cut lots easier and cleaner than the WW2. Decided to get one of my own, but it came with broken teeth out of the box. A couple had broke where they were glued on. Another couple of teeth broke in half, as in, the carbide was broke in half. I never tried the new one in my saw. I don't like the idea of teeth breaking off during use, so I'm just returning it. Probably won't get another since I see now that others have commented on similar issues."
3,Not great for rip cuts,"The blade struggles with rip cuts in hardwood. 3/4 ""Hickory and 1"" maple will result in burning and bogging down of the saw. My other combination blade that came with my saw cuts the same woods easily..."
4,Great blade - but can over heat your motor,"Love the blade. But you have to have a saw powerful enough to run a 40 tooth blade. it burned out my 3/4 HP motor on my old contractor saw. Which turned out to be a blessing in disguise - because I bought a Grizzly 1.5 HP motor and love it! It works the best on sheet goods (plywood, ect), I prefer the 24 tooth blade from freud for hardwood lumber - oak, walnut, maple. The 24 tooth gets just as good a cut on the lumber but without taxing the motor (HEAT!). If you are building cabinets - get it! If you are working more with lumber - go with Freud LU87R010 10-Inch 24-Tooth. Now I have both in my aersenal!"
1,Dissappointed.,"As an experienced wood worker I was expecting great things from this new technology blade from Freud. I used the blade on my 3hp Delta Unisaw (USA made)with a Beis rip fence. Upon receiving the blade, I removed my FWWII and replaced it with the Fusion. Ripping several feet of white oak produced moderate to severe edge burning which would indicate an alignment issue.I used a TS Aligner (basically a dial indicator) to realign both the blade and the rip fence. I always toe out the rip fence perhaps 1/64"" at the end to prevent binding. Upon starting the alignment process, my dial indicator had the Fusion blade all over the place indicating the blade was not flat. I retuned it to Amazon - why really bother?? I threw my FWWII back on with no problems. I rated the blade a '1' because it did produce incredibly smooth end cuts. I must have received a bad blade. It will be interesting to read additional reviews."
4,Freud P410,"Ripped one board so far with it, easy smooth cut. Lives up to it's advertizing. Need to cut some more wood before I could give it six stars, but so far I'm impressed"
5,Amazingly Diverse album,"Great album! Couldn't believe how rich the recording was! Everyone on this record is extremely talented and musically focused, from the cohesive, appropriate guitar to the deep, soulful, meanigful singing. Extremely happy with this album, and would reccommend it to anyone, of any age. Just good, clean, non-offensive music that fans of any genre would appreciate!"
5,Great CD!!!,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ALBUM! The singer is sexy and sultry. HAWT. Love ""Just a Girl"" truly an awesome song. Why aren't these guys on MTV yet? They're right up there. You won't be dissapointed!!!@! Buy this CD now!"
1,"hate ""live"" performances","Skip this if you are a Pam Tillis fan and want some of her greatest songs and they were originally produced. This is a CD with live performances that come nowhere near the original. BUT - if you like the live experience, then have at it."
2,Very confusing,"I am very dis-appointed. May be i did not order the right book. I was looking for something dedicatedly for .net not a general book, that is so very hard to follow. Its may be for very advanced developers who can put pieces together themselves. Its for older versions of .net Buy it if you looking for just the theory:-("
5,Second to none!,"Yasser is this kind of developers who make our world easier to understand and better to live in. This book is your ""ONLY"" guide to XML Web services. You will start understanding all about WS's from the second chapter (XSD: Type System). Yasser's approach to XML Web Services is all what you need to unlock the magic door of this great messaging world. Enjoy!"
3,Not as pictured,"As a previous reviewer stated, the pouch is much more black than brown. The embossed logo shown in the picture has been replaced with a gaudy tan leather patch, seems like it will just be in the way (in fact I've already removed it). It also has white stitching throughout and the metal parts are not brass colored but silvery steel. Not that it matters, but the picture is wrong and really should be updated. Seems cheap, and it was, which is why I bought it. It's surprisingly lightweight but good and stiff with a lot of rivets at the stress points. I imagine that, like other leather pouches, it will wear well."
2,Disappointed,"I just recieved my tooll pouch today, and as excited as I was to to open the box, I was very disappointed to see that instead of being brown as the picture shows, the pouch was black -not dark brown, not even very dark brown, absolute black.As far as I'm concerned, there are plenty of other tool pouches on Amazon. Yes, the functionality and craftsmanship of the pouch is good, but lets face it- color is also a major deciding factor in this sort of purchase, and I couldn't have been more disappointed. I use a tool pouch every day, and yes, to me the color is important. I wear dark brown boots and a dark brown belt, and I wanted it to match.I need a tool pouch for work and wont have time to wait to return it and replace it with one that looks better with my uniform, because I have to use it tomorrow (and every day after that.)At least it was only $27, I guess you get what you pay for..."
5,Hungry Californios,"After the civil war Texans did not have much to work with except 5000 plus long horns grazing free and wild in the breaks, a tight thorny hug bush. The cattle belong to those who are brave and tough enough to get them out and then drive them through Indian nations over mountains and across deserts. The California Trail is such an adventure. A great read."
4,Hells Bells,"What I really want to know is why, how, why do they turn to the left a half turn? They are just hanging from a rope. How does the rope know?Tom Horn had a perfect hanging in Steve McQueen's movie. ""... he joined the others in that graceful half turn to the left.""""The rope caught with a quivering twang, a gentle bass note heard only by Stone...The rope creaked, rotating a half turn to the left.""""The rope creaked and the body turned halfway around to the left, a pendulum drifting to a halt.""""The platform twitched...then it swayed in accompaniment with the creaking of the rope as the body completed its semi revolution to the left.""The ""Tombstone Epitaph,"" writer was surprised by the ending of the ""Master Executioner."" Nevertheless, the ending was foretold about a hundred pages in when Rudd revealed, ""Hell's Bells, you could fill a book with them...!"""
3,80's baby,I really like this movie because i felt for the Lucus character. It's very 80's which i love because i was born in the late 80's and it's cool to see how they were back then.
4,a must own dvd,"what a good movie, really sad that he had all these problems during his youth and then the 80's were gone and he tried a come back but everything went right to dvd. Now he is longer with us, I just wonder what they will say about this movie and some of the other movies he madeGood movies never die, so i say get this movie it rocks"
2,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,This is another one of those movies that you wonder why it is still in print. All this film is about is a fourteen year old science geek who falls in love with a gorgeous cheerleader. However she is in love with someone else. Anyhow the cheerleader and her boyfriend try being friends with Lucas. Is Lucas grateful? No all he can do is whine and complain and make everyone miserable. He is one of those characters who only think of themselves. Don't waste your time on this one.
5,A great movie from the 80's!,"I saw this movie in the theater along time ago and I liked it. I thought it was really good. It has a wonderful score but no soundtrack. How come this movie doesn't have a soundtrack? Well, anyways I think for those of you who hadn't seen this movie should rent it. Ya'll would like it."
2,Not worth it if you are in,"If you are already in the Army you really dont need this book. Everything covered in it you should know from Basic Training. It would be good to get if you are thinking about joining though, it covers the basics really well. If you are already enlisted I would suggest getting the NCO guide and start looking to better yourself and get promoted."
5,Nydia still remains #1,"""Hay Unos Ojos"" has got to be a #1 hit of this cd along with ""Llevame Contigo."" They are beautiful songs and will definitely make this cd sell. I encourage all music lovers to buy this cd...it does not matter if you don't like spanish music..after this cd..you will!!!!"
3,"interesting, but a bit creepy","this book is well written, well paced and about an interesting topic. But it creeped out my 9 1/2 year old son and my 7 1/2 year old twins took his cue and we never finished the book together, though I read it on my own."
5,Ice Mummy the ice mummy,"the ice mummymy favorite chapter in ice mummy is chapter 6, time traveler. i savor that chapter because it tells about how he died and where he died .i believe the age group is 9 and up. one reason i think that is because it shows stuff little kids should not be able to see or read about.i enjoyed the book because it was interesting to read about. it also had the tools that the ice mummy had with him when he died. the people in the book tried to figure out how the ice mummy was killed in the book.the ice mummy is not up to date because the book was made in 1998. the ice mummy video was made in 2001. the book says that the ice mummy died from freezing to death. in the movie it says that he was shot in the back by a man who must have been mad at him."
4,Tiger Fire,"This is definitely Volapuk's premiere album. Neither 97's ""Slang"" or the new ""Polygot"" approach this album in quality. The overall production of Tiger Fire is stupendous -this was the only album Volapuk produced with Steve Chamberston. It is one of the most original albums I have in my collection, and even though it is pretty old (95), it's really a timeless classic. Its driving melodies and dark beats are great, and it constantly finds its way into my cd player, at home or on the road. This album dosen't have any catchy pop hits or anything, but its a great all-around background cd. Its a great way to expand your musical preferences, if you're willing to try something experimental. Take my advice and give this one a try. If you already have or like this selection, try Seidah Garrett or NRBQ's ""Honest Dollar."""
1,top book,there is only one real regiment in the british army and this book tells you all you need to know.
3,TOO MUCH MISERY!!!!,"I have read other books by Jane Feather that were very good. My favorite Vanity and Emerald Swan. But this book has too much spousal abuse and depressing description of war. I was a teenager during WWII and I can do without both. I have several of her books that I haven't read yet and am now a bit leery of her stories. I am retired and read for enjoyment, entertainment and, as most of us, to escape reality. If I wanted this I could subscribe to a paper or watch CNN. I will perserve though as I can always use them for trading if I can't take anymore.The premise of the story and the characters were strong and commendable. With all that I really appreciated Alex Marshall and what he was going through. Shades of our own Civil War with torn families."
3,Please be upfront about reissues!,"My one pet peeve with Amazon is its failure to alert customers when books are re-issues of older books. I know I read this at least 10 years ago, and in fact you have some reviews from the year 2000, etc. I have purchased books that I didn't know I had already read because of this; I have at least 4 that I did not return (did not know how to do it when I first started using Amazon).That said, I recall enjoying this book, as I have all of Jane Feather's books, even several re-issues that I had NOT previously read."
5,MEMORABLE AND WONDERFUL!,"I read this book when it was first (I think) issued. I loved it. The dichotomy between the words ""Beloved"" and ""Enemy"" is developed perfectly by Jane Feather in this enthralling book. What a love story; what a pair of lovers! I am writing this years later because: (1) It was one of my favorite books at the time I read it, and (2) it seems to be getting an unfavorable rating from several reviewers, so I thought I would try to bring more balance to the negative reviews. This is a beautifully written book and the story has a depth of emotion that is missing in so many more superficial writings."
1,Way to Long and Boring,"I was so excited to read this book. Unfortunately, it was to unbelievable right from the beginning where Virginia jumps right into bed with Alex who had just captured and taken over her house. Time and again as she ""hated him"" she jumped into bed with him. Alex treated her like his mistress, who he didn't care about - even if he said he cared. I have read over 40 historical romance books so far this year, this is the only one I felt I had to write a bad review about. What could have been a great story turned into a very long, unbelievable and boring story. I was quite let down, sad and frustrated that my hopes for a great feel good, historical romance were dashed by a unconvincing, implausible and improbable story."
3,Safer to buy this locally to be sure of what you get.,"I've had an MP1600 for years, and it's the only plunger that works in my low-flow toilet. Ordered a new one on Amazon, and it's not the same. It's slightly bigger, and when I try to use it in my tiny toilet bowl, it ends up pushing the water out onto the floor. Like another reviewer, I figured I'd just keep it for sanitary reasons, rather than trying to ship it back used. Now I notice that although the card that came attached to it indeed says MP1600, the plunger itself actually says MP1700-S. It's not clear to me whether that's really another model, or an alternate labeling of a model that has changed over the years. Anyway, I've seen some Master Plunger models at local stores recently. Maybe I can find the right one there, if it still exists. But if you do indeed have a low-flow toilet, be careful about trying to order a plunger online."
5,Exact description and good delivery service.,"Alfredo De Angelis with his traditional singers Carlos Dante, Julio Martel y Floreal Ruiz for the period of 1943 to 1949. Good selection by Harlequin."
5,BoCo rocks,This is a really good tape. The dragon though scary was pretty funny. Donald & Douglas are 2 of my favorite characters. BoCo is also one of them. In the later tapes Donald & Douglas aren't in it as much as Bill & Ben but they are better. BoCo is really deprived of a good episode. But it was great to see Edward do something good for a change. Percy really isn't in it much either and he's one of the best characters. Percy's Ghostly Trick is a must buy if you like this one
3,"Beware of ""not nice"" words!","My three year old loves this video, as the Chinese Dragon is one of his favorite trains to play with. However, they do use the words ""Shut up!"" a time or two, which I could live without. Obviously, this isn't a phrase I want my child using, so we may hide this video away until he's older."
3,The ways of stopping being scared...,"With toy, on this video, I have a train called 'PRESENT CARGO CAR' (not Peter Sam) with present. In this front cover, it shows the CHINESE DRAGON and PERCY being sticky-jam (not Bill or Ben (the olden case)) seeing Sir Topham Hatt. We have the new diseasel called BoCo, and he had his eyes nearly popped out!EPISODES ARE: -NAME RATING:1) THOMAS, PERCY & THE DRAGON 5/52) DONALD & DOUGLAS 4/53) THE DEPUTATION 4.5/54) TIME FOR TROUBLE 3/55) A SCARF FOR PERCY 4/56) THE DISEASEL 5/57) EDWARD'S EXPLOIT 3.5/5By Michael Higham"
3,Good plot but could have been better,It's definatly worth watching but dont look for the greatest acting or special effects.
2,no ria,"You may tap out a beat but these are not able to ria. Also there is no difference in pitch, they sound exactly the same. The cording is extremely thick and long. Fine for a toy. Not good enough for a flamenco dance class."
3,My product evaluation,"In my case, the ""leather bindery"" as described in a previous review, turned out to be the equivalent of shoe laces. In addition, for a newcomer to castanets, it would help if each pair was labeled right and left, or male and female. They're not."
4,Great product!,"I am very satisfied with these castanets! The sound is perfect and they are exactly what I needed. I am using this in a play preformance for The Ramona Bowl Pageant and they passed my coreagrapher's test of usage. Only things I didnt like were that the ""leather ties"" were too long, and didnt have a proper knot for easy adjustment. I had a friend fix the knots, though, and now they are perfect. All in all; a great pair of castanets!"
3,"kind of slow on kills, good suspense.","to tell you the truth this slasher wasn't all that good like some of the critics say, very low budget movie, the kill scenes suck, the story wasn't bad, suspenseful, and does have a shocking ending. I was hoping more of kind of like the 80's type slasher movies you may disagree but the kind of slashers i like are no offscreen kills, i like more onscreen kills, and what was up with the beginning it was like watching a porn which made no sense. I don't think i would recommend this to slasher fans but if you want suspense you may want this."
1,Not a horror movie...,"This movie is soft core porn, not a horror movie. It's plot (and I use the term very loosely) is centered around numerous soft core porn scenes with some random violence, ridiculous dialog, and terrible editing - not to mention the characters seem to drive on the wrong side of the road throughout the entire thing (just one example of just how bad this one is). Save your money and keep looking, unless this is what you're looking for! If you're a horror fan, even B-horror, this one will leave you wishing you could get your money back. You've been warned!"
2,"yet another ghostwritten ""Johnstone"" pumped out by a hack","this is another of those 'counterfeit' Johnstones, written after he died--low quality, poor writer, fake name as coauthor--a counterfeit spin off of series written by some hack writer hired by estate to pump out more books and maximum revenue stream after he died. halfway readable but you sure don't want to save it and it is worth what it sells for in used bookshopes, maybe a half buck for a quick read if you don't get fed up with it and put it down to gather dust. Good luck finishing it. It will give you at least one evening's reading and may seem interesting, especially if you like the character and the earlier ooks in the series actually written by Johnstone, which I did."
3,Too Old to Cut the Mustard,"We have travelled a long way with Jamie Ian ever since he was kidnapped by the Shawnee people of the Ohio territory as a young boy, and he met the young and beautiful white girl, Kate Olmstead, and then in other books he went into the Mexican War of 1848, and then in the Civil War his sons fought on opposite sides. But now, in SCREAM OF EAGLES, I find that author Johnstone has brought old man McAllister a bridge too far; he is so old that I'm surprised he can still move a muscle, much less act like the mountain man he used to be.However with the death of Kate at the hands of a ruthless cut-throat, the old man is forced to make some more trouble for the bad guys. If you ever get confused about which book is which in William Johnstone's EAGLES series, you'll always remember SCREAM as the one that should have been set in a retirement home! Other than that, his standard excellent Western fare.The new DESTINY OF EAGLES is much better!"
3,Very light hinges,"I build small keep sake boxes. I purchased a couple sets of these hinges at an Ace hardware store. The hinges do function as hinges but are very light. They are 24 gauge brass so don't use them on a box of any size. The hinges come escutcheon pins not screws. A 1/16"" pilot hole is too large. I was able to get them to work by strating a pilot hole with 1/16"" to a shallow depth and hten driving the pins. A large nail punch works well to drive the pins without marring the hinges. However be very careful as the poins bend easily. I will use the couple of these that I bought but will go back to using middle butt hinges for future work."
5,FIVE STAR CLASSIC DISCO.,"ESTE ES UN ALBUM CLASICO DE LA MUSICA DISCO Y NO DUDO QUE SEA DE LA ENTERA SATISFACCIÓN DE CUALQUIER ADMIRADOR DE LA MUSICA DISCO O DANCE, HOT ESTA EDITANDO ESTO AHORA EN CD-R, LO CUAL ES UNA LASTIMA YA QUE HOT HABIA GANADO YA CIERTO PRESTIGIO COMO MARCA DANCE, PERO POR LO VISTO NO LE IMPORTA PERDER ESO CON TAL DE GANAR MAS CON MENOS CALIDAD, RECOMIENDO QUE SI COMPRAN ESTE CD LO COPIEN ENSEGUIDA, YA QUE ESTOS CD-R DE HOT TIENDEN A ""GASTARSE"".

3,A PROBLEM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THE PROBLEM : IT'S A CDR HOT PRODUCTIONS LIKE FOOLING PEOPLE WITH CDR'S CDR CD R CD R CDR CDR CDR CDR CDR CCDR GO TO UNIDISC
2,"1 song is the reason for the time put in. ""Move on up""","Still looking for the original song and artist.These artist really made the song a energetic, upbeat and feelgood peiceThanks! !"
3,Our Little Girl-we don't care about her,This sounds like a more modern movie and many children could relate to this. Molly (TEMPLE) is a sweet little girl who only see both parents together two days a year. When they want to get a divore Shirley(Molly) tries to keep them together. She goes to the circus and decides to run away. I think they could have found a better thing then running away but can't do that now. She sings one short song in this movie and it takes away from the hapiness because when Shirley sings-everyone's happy. In the movie her parents really don't seem to care about her which I think is very odd. Not the greatest- but see it anways-you might think diffrent.
3,Shirley Temple the BEST child star ever!,This movie is very different from a usual Shirley Temple movie. But she is still so very cute. If youre a big Shirley Temple fan like me than you must buy this and if you dont like Shirley Temple (which is impossible) then dont buy it. It is a sweet movie and it is very enjoyable. Although there is only one song and no dancing. I gave it three stars because it has Shirley Temple and because it made me smile!
1,Our Little Girl VHS,Never received. Seller sent to wrong address. Would like re-mailed. Never heard anymore about this item. Not pleased with results.
2,Meh,"These shocks were touted as performance shocks, an upgrade over the OEM ones. My suggestion, go with the OEM ones if you are looking to restore original ride smoothness and handling."
1,Can't get it to play,We have had two copies of this game from two different sources and both have program issues. The first one would play and my grandson liked it but it would lock up intermittently and some screens were blank. We returned that and got another copy. This one would not even boot or start. It has also been returned. If I ever get one to play I will write a new review. Buyer Beware.
5,Cute Game,"We love the Cars movie and this video game does not disappoint. I bought this for my 4 year old son and he loves it. It is easy enough for him not to become frustrated, yet there are many levels to unlock that also keeps it challenging. His dad and I love to play also."
4,fun for all ages,This is s fun game to play. The one thing I do not like is allot of the tracks are very simaler but still a blast. The pit crew thing is very intense and very fun to try and beat my son. I repeat try.
5,Lightening Shines!,Very nice game. Follows the kid friendly theme of the movies. Voice overs are true and there are a lot of races and interesting things for the little ones to do. The adults can enjoy an outing to the track with their children or grandchildren. Enjoy!
2,Skip this set. Get the originals,"The real original Outlaws broke up after only three studio albums, Outlaws, Lady In Waiting, and Hurry Sundown. There was also a very good live album. Every thing that followed is just filler. Outlaws, Lady In Waiting, Live, and Hurry Sundown could not be any better, great raucous, guitar oriented country rock. I recommend that you skip this haphazard collection and buy the three real Outlaws albums. You will be glad you did."
4,The Country Side of Southern Rock,"Southern rock always contained some country in it, but the amount varied with the band. The Allman Brothers had only a tad and were more oriented towards blues and jazz. Lynyrd Skynyrd had a bit more country, but they were more of a straight rock band. With Marshall Tucker and the Outlaws the country influence becomes more apparent.This album is a great showcase for both sides of the Outlaws. The band's reputation rests upon its classic guitar songs, such as ""Green Grass & High Tides"". The country ballads, however, are not throw-aways, and are more ""country"" than what you can hear on the radio nowadays."
3,No Holiday,"I couldn't buy this CD fast enough, however, I am seriously bummed that it does not include the great song ""Holiday"" on it."
1,What Went Wrong???,"Dem Outlaws sure don't know what deyre doing anymores! I went to Wal-Mart hopin' to came on home to my wife Bobbie-Sue with some good ol' steel-twangin' country music-to-my-ears, but when I played this nasty album, I heard my herds startin' to stampede away from this God-awful excuse for horseshoe harmony. Poor Bessie the cow still shrudders her udders when someoone, even a mighty good singer like meself, begins a-hittin' those high notes! Folks, just stay away from this here album."
5,The Outlaws are the greatest Southern rock band ever!!,"The Outlaws put out a greatest hits album back in the eary 1980's that omitted one key element of the band, Henry Paul. This compilation is truely their ""greatest hits"" CD. From ""Waterhole"" to ""Green Grass and High Tides"" the Outlaws show why they were the smoothest sounding southern rock band of all time. Hughie Thomasson is one of the most original and unique guitar players of all time, and will always be my favorite, ahead of other southern greats such as Dicky Betts, Gary Rossington, and Allen Collens . This CD is a must for anyone interested in Southern rock, Country blues, or good ol' Rock and Roll!!!"
5,Guitars Guitars Guitars!,I've been listening to these guys since the mid seventies. The were and still remain the best line up of leads in the south. The western flair they bring to their cuts can't be beat (as it were). This disc contains their best cuts and should be on any true southern rocker's shelf.
4,Great Southern Rock!,I liked this music back in the good 'ol days and I still appreciate it. We used to party our tails off to all the good 'ol boys in the southern rock brotherhood! Outlaws are right in there with all the greats.
4,SOUTHERN ROCK AT IT'S BEST.,"IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I.VE LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC,BUT IT STILL KICKS BUTT. THIS IS CONSIDERED COUNTRY BY TODAYS STANDARDS,TO ME IT'S GOOD RED NECK ROCK N ROLL.THE SONGS MAY BE 20 YEARS OLDBUT THE MUSIC IS TIMELESS.HEY IT'S ONLY MUSIC ENJOY."
4,Underrated Southern Rockers -- worth a listen,"For those of you who aren't old enough to remember, the Outlaws were arguably more popular than Lynyrd Skynrd in the heydey of southern rock (1975 - 1980). Skynyrd's unfortunate demise led to them being canonized, though they certainly had several wonderful songs to justify it.The Outlaws' first 3 Albums (Self-titled, Lady In Waiting, Hurry Sundown) were amazing LP's and this ""Best of"" CD captures most of their high notes. Its missing a few great tunes (Holiday from Hurry Sundown immediately comes to mind) but overall is a good survey of their music.The quality of their music tailed off quickly after Hurry Sundown -- partially due to Henry Paul leaving, but probably due to burnout on several levels. Billy Jones was an amazing guitarist with a unique voice, on par with Neil Young. Its too bad he wasn't with us longer.These guys were the 'metal band' of the Southern Rock area, so if you enjoy loud guitars and Skynrd-esque music, this CD is for you."
5,Musical ecstacy of bygone days,"So many riveting musical notes, so many years gone by. Serve up a compact platter of those ancient tunes to discover how timeless they really are, and how lucky we were to hear them at time of fruition. Sometimes I wonder how Henry Paul can now belt out mundain ""Blackhawk"" hits on the country charts after being involved in such wonderful musicmaking. This CD is an offering that takes us only part of the way. My hopes are for fan pressure to re-issue all of the originals. Perhaps Messrs. Thomasson and Paul will find it in their outlaw hearts to someday make this happen."
1,obviously early work,"Needing some summertime reading, I decided to dive back into Delinsky's early works for ones I had missed. This was a mistake. The plot was overly simplistic, the characters horribly under-developed, and the message so predictable & sappy that I only got through it b/c it's such a quick read and I'm stubborn about finishing what I start. When the male protagonist (Daniel) calls the female protagonist (Nia) ""Babe"" at the start of every conversation, it is jolting to me how out of character he seems.Anyway, it's nice to see Delinsky's writing has improved over time. Kudos to her publisher for sticking with her and developing her writing style. This one, however, is worth skipping...."
5,Remarkably sophisticated humor,"The jokes and funny stories in this book are awfully dated (probably would have kids in the 50s and 60s rolling on the floor) but many are remarkably sophisticated. There's an entire section with short poems that I find give me a chuckle, even 3+ decades after I received it for my 7th Christmas. I remember some of them verbatim:I eat my peas with honey;I've done it all my life.They do taste kind of funny,But it keeps them on the knife.and""Twixt optimist and pessimist, the difference is quite droll.The optimist sees the doughnut while the pessimist sees the hole.""Recommended for anyone who loves a good turn of phrase, a family-friendly laugh, or for reading to youngsters - and then explaining what words like ""twixt"" and ""droll"" used to mean ;)"
2,"""Not that bizzy""","This album has too many f***** interlude's, it's just plain ridiculous. The album is like a maxi-single, if you want real thug s***, get krayzie bone's album's. Bizzy just wine's all the time, and his flow's are just plain weak. The only good song on this cd is ""When thugs cry"", he does'nt wine on this song, and the beat is tight. If you like skit's, this is the album for you,{note}""There are more skit's than song's, to me there is"",""Social studies"" is a skit, about a kid shooting up a school.""Stupid"", you can tell he rushed on this cd, he could've added eighteen more track's, to call this a album. I'f you want alot of tight song's, and sycho lyric's, krayzie's"" Thug mentality"" album is for you. Or if you like interlude's, and one minute tracks, bizzy will have what you need, ""Weak effort""."
5,Bizzy Bone's 2nd Best Solo Album,This was a tight CD. Other than The Gift this CD is Bizzy's Best. You have to buy this CD because it shows the versatility of Bizzy's rapping and singing. He is very strong in both aspects on this CD. If you already have this CD or are getting it you also need to buy Bizzy Bone's THE GIFT.AN AWESOME CD!
2,What happened to Bone's music!,"I may be just about the only one who thinks this album is not that tight but I don't care. For one thing, you can't even understand half the things he'ssaying. The only songs on the album I like are ""On the Freeway"" and ""Social Studies"". I have to say ""Social Studies"" is tight because the beat to that song is hard and I can really feel what he's talking about and relate to his anger. So, to put it simple, Bone is not the same as they used to be. (I guess it's because of the unfortunate fact that Easy E is no longer living). They don't have to speak as violently as they once did but I wish they could have kept the beats hardcore on at least most of their songs of today. These days, the beats are just too soft and I just can't get into many of their more recent songs."
5,Heaven'z Movie is off the chain,"Even thought Black widow cut the album down from 22 tracks to 13. Bizzy Bone rips up his strong come back from a 2 year absence. The LiL R.I.Psta introduces menesky mob along with his brothers hitlah capo and majesty. Songs like waitin for warfare and thugs cry give the album the thuggish style that Bone alwayz has had. I love how Bizzy disses Gansta boo on the roof(on fire) and how he shows Black Widow that Bone does not want to be in ruthless no more, after she ran them to the floor. The soft touch of on the freeway and nobody can stop shows Bizzy's love side and young side and how he had to struggle throught life to get his. This album is a classic and even thought marching on washignton and yes yes yall were cut off by tomica wright, Bizzy makes it up wit the rest of the album. The only on thing I would critize is the absence of Bone on the album, but due to the Black widow incident I understand why they arent on."
1,Very Flat,Bone is only strong as a group.doing solo projects does nothing to enhance their music what so ever.case in point here.what's up with Bizzy riding on Prince? the whole disc has cross over all over it.the only cut worth taking to the Bank is Social Studies.that's the best one.
5,THE BIZZIE BONE,"THIS IS THE BIZZIE BONE. HIS LYRICS ARE TIGHT. HE SPEAKS HIS MIND IN HIS SONGS. THAT IS ONE THING I LOVE ABOUT BIZZY; HE KEEPS IT REAL WITH HIS FANS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. HIS LYRICS MAY BE EXPLICIT, BUT HE HAS BEEN THROUGH SOME CRAZY STUFF."
5,This kix a$$ baby!,Thugz Cry iz one of the best songs this year! And the rest of the album iznt far behind. Definitely not a disappointment...I cant wait for the other 3 Bone albums to come out...Bone Thugz Baby!!
4,heavens movie,heavens movie is bizzy bone best cds next to alpha and omega and a song for you anothe must have for any bpne thugs n harmony fan
3,not enough music,did u all know that their were sposed to be 17 tracks on this album and marchin' on washington and yes yes yall were sposed to be full song's but the album is good not great some of the tracks missing were confessions which features 2pac and walkin n da cold featuring flexxararry slaim and que loco but the best song on this album is demons surround me which is so tight just awsome he should hve realesed this song off the album instead of thug'z cry which is not bad but check out the gift and hell'z movie if u get a chance. yes he has a cd called hell'z movie
5,If I could I'd give it 20 stars!!,This CD is TIZ-IGHT!!! Can't no one get wit him. He has a broad way of using his vocals for ex: Track 9 he slows it down a lil and actualy raps & sings about something not so hard core; track 13 is one of his most hord-core songs he has!! I like the way he buids up his intensity in both tracks 5 & 13.Suggestion for all of those who don't have this cd :: BUY IT!!!!!
3,Fire on the Mountain,"Set in contemporary India; Nanda Kaul has finished raising her family - children, grandchildren, greatgrandchildren - and seems to want nothing more than to be left alone in her remote hillside home to finish out her days in isolation, peace and quiet. That is until her greatgranddaughter Raka is unexpectedly left with her while the child's mother is ill. Raka is even more remote and independent in nature than Nanda Kaul. The style of writing is poetic; that is, there is no excess of words, and what words are there create vivid images. The story is character-driven, thus proceeding at a slow pace. And it is sad. I would definitely not recommend this book to readers who prefer their stories to wrap up neatly and with happily-ever-after endings."
2,short and boring,"This book is boring. The book is character driven, but it never gets deep enough into the characters to make them interesting. It's overly wordy and too descriptive to the point that it is excessive and overloaded beyond the point of being able to draw an accurate image of what is being described. I only finished the book because it was pretty short, but even that took me a while because it was so slow and boring."
2,A potential 5 star volume that ultimately failed,"Helen Vendler is surely a brilliant satirist whose goal is to skewer pretentious academics. I am stunned by her ability to cook up a consistently hilarious porridge of ivory tower gobbledygook. The comfort in poring through these dense pages of litcrit mumbojumbo comes from counting oneself lucky never to have had to sit through a lecture delivered by the kind of pompous professor that Vendler so brilliantly parodies. Every aspiring academic and every serious psychologist should invest in this perfect example of how a tone deaf literary pretender can seize the spotlight from the greatest poet who ever lived. The ultimate tragedy of Dr. Vendler's work is that genius of her caliber is underestimated. And so, alas, currently anyway, too many gullible readers fail to get the joke, and the brilliance fizzles. Or, as William Shakespeare noted, ""Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall."""
3,NO CD in Paperback,"The Editorial reviews for this product do say they are for the hardback, but it isn't indicated that the CD mentioned is NOT included with the paperback. For almost $23.00, I was disappointed when it wasn't there. I'm sure the book will be helpful by itself, but I was looking forward to hearing her readings."
5,Does not dissapoint!,"This album was a strong, emotional, but more upbeat answer to Strong Enough. Their classic harmonizing is as good as ever, and we get to hear a poignant song from non-lead singer Van Stephenson. If you are pondering a possible first Blackhawk CD purchase, this one will definitely not dissapoint!"
1,Not recommended,"This publication has not been subject to technical editing, or if it has, the staff performing the edit were definitely unqualified. The book contains literally dozens of errors, most of which should have been caught before publication. In many cases the text refers to a figure the contents of which bear no relation to the text. As an experienced VB.NET developer I was able to resolve most of the amomalies but anyone attempting to use this book as a migration aid from VB6 to VB.NET would really struggle. When I emailed the publisher (WROX) they displayed a distinct lack of interest, suggesting I compile a list of errors and send it to them and they would, if they agreed, add them to the errata on their website."
4,a good product,"The Household Essentials 131200 Silver TableTop Mini Ironing Board is performing well and as expected. It offers a lot of value for the money, mostly based on its convenient size, good ironing surface, and features (pull out rack on which to rest the iron, and easy to fold up). Worth a serious look. I'd get one again if necessary."
2,disappointing,very disappointed in this rather expensive board with basically no padding so that frame work shows through on ironed fabric
3,It works,"Compact, easy to store.Not enough padding, but you get what you pay for.Pretty good buy I guess, overall."
4,Fits the Bill,"Light and sturdy--just what I need. Some reviewers talk about the thinness of the padding allowing the metal grate to cause a pattern to be pressed into your clothing, but I haven't seen that. The pad is not as thick as other ironing boards I've used, but it's enough.I haven't used the pull-out iron rest, so I can't comment on that.There is a latch on the bottom that secures the swing-down legs into position that is a little bent, but it still works fine.It's nice to be able to pick up the entire board and rotate it when needed to make ironing easier. You can't easily do that with full-sized boards.To get 5 stars from me, this would need to have a thicker pad and higher manufacturing quality. It works for what I need though, so I do not regret my purchase."
1,You will not receive this item number...,"You can buy this item from other sellers for less money... they will send you item 131210 and have your order fulfilled by Amazon as opposed to a 3 rate online retailer Shop At Clares. They are terrible. Lead you to believe you are buying a different item that has better reviews than others listed and will charge you $10 more after shipping.Shop At Clares is TERRIBLE!As for the ironing board itself which I am stuck with because of Shop At Clares...There is virtually NO PADDING on this board,I ironed on it once and the cloth cover discolored from holding the iron over a spot for a second,and overall it seems great if they would improve the padding for it or if you can find a new pad and cover for it!Did I mention Shop At Clares is TERRIBLE! Great at taking your money, after that TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Wonderful, but somewhat disappointed","This is just what I was looking for, I gave it 3 stars as the cover & pad are so thin. When you Iron your shirts it evenshows the metal grate marks on the shirts. So I will have to make a padding (darn it)"
3,Handy,"Received and immediately put it to use. The size is perfect and easy to store. I was delighted that a ""door hook"" was included so I was able to hang it right away. Just remember, you get what you pay for. There's a reason some other boards cost more. It has a metal (aluminum?) frame but a thin pad which might need to be replaced in time. The iron tray is difficult to open but I prefer to place my iron on the counter, eliminating the danger of it falling over. Bottom line, if you do a limited amount of ironing, this is the board for you. The drawbacks are minimal and the price is right."
5,Wonderful Read!,"Having thoroughly enjoyed ""I and Claudius,"" I was delighted to discover that this book is even better. Not only are her travels fascinating but, more importantly, her writing style has come into full flower. This is a great ""laugh out loud"" read with thoughtful subtext. I cannot wait to read what she writes next!"
1,ONE tiny piece of chocolate??,"The item description says this should contain four pieces, but I received ONE tiny .53 ounce piece of chocolate in a big box! I should have read the description better because I thought this was for the large bars, not the little pieces (my mistake). I wouldn't have paid this price--I could have bought a whole bag at BJs for what I paid for the one piece plus shipping. I have contacted the seller regarding only receiving one, not four pieces, and will revise this if I receive the rest."
5,Better than expected!,I was impressed with how much room the organizer has. I have had some in the past where I could only fit a few remotes into it. I can easily fit 5 or more remotes if need be. It looks very professional and serves a great purpose.
5,Will appeal to any reader of fiction,"Tales Out of School is a wonderful, able, mature first novel, easily one of the finest debuts in recent American fiction. As other reviewers have noted here, the prose is marvelous--delicate and sinuous--though the book is far from a stylistic exercise. Taylor's investment in language and his story are never at odds, one always seems dependent on the other. With intriguing asides on history and mythology, and a wide cast of characters, men and women of diverse age and temperament, Tales Out of School can be read in a day or two, for the book's pacing is as much of an achievement as its style. Both concise and languorous, it holds more power and intelligence than most novels three times its size."
2,Not Worth It,In my fourtyfive years as an editor for my local paper I have not yet found a novel that starts with such promise as this one. The unfourtunate thing is that by the end of the book Taylor's prose becomes quickly messy and overly-explanitive. Dissapointing for such a promising author.
5,Two thumbs up!,"I was VERY pleased-- this book was exactly what I was looking for for my little one, who we're teaching both french and english. It's very simple-- the english word, the french word, with pronunciation underneath. All the books in this series are great."
3,the software on CD has problem,"this book is a good book, but the software CD is a garbage.as it said it should include the ixa software sdk kit, but inside, there is only a firmware kit, and can't be installed at all, it requires the software sdk kit 4.1.what a hell! So I have to rate it 3."
5,ill ass independent hip hop...,it don't sound independent though (if that's a bad thing...) coley's got a crazy complicated flow that's all about the rhythms. He's a dope ass producer too doing I think the whole album? He ranges from story raps to posse tracks to just dope emceein. Seeing is believeing so get on this quick fast...
4,Handy Niche Tool,"I bought this item to use in electrical wiring/ troubleshooting and plumbing troubleshooting. I have used it to troubleshoot a chronically clogged drain, for which it worked perfectly. I have also used it to locate a drilling point and fish wires through a hole in a bottom plate in an existing outside wall for an outlet above a standard height kitchen counter. The 36"" reach was a little short, but it sure beat not seeing at all. I had to use another tool, in a way it was not intended, to push back the insulation at the bottom of the wall so I could see the bottom plate. I have plans to use this product in the near future on other wiring and plumbing projects and look forward to using this tool, with its crystal clear view, to make the job easier.I received this product in perfect condition from ToolTopia 5 days after ordering, which was the day before the earliest estimated delivery date."
4,Gently touch your heart!!,"I decided to buy this CD after I've heard his sax songs in a few of his previous albums I like. It turned out that I love this album the best!! He puts all imagination I could ever think about: lovely, affectionately and passionately. "" The Champion's Theme"" is my most favourite. What a sax player, what a song."
1,The Brittany Spears of jazz-e pop,"Yuck, its definately not jazz and anyone who says it is doesn't know what jazz is and has most likely never listened to Sonny Rollins or John Coltrane let alone Charlie Parker or Wayne Shorter. Not even Kenny G(odawful) himself calls his music jazz, rather he calls it instrumental pop. Pop as in elevator music, its just trite, unchallenging, though relaxing musical fluff. What a shame and a travesty that this purveyor of sugary insubstantial preproccessed junk food for the ears is the biggest selling sax player in the world. There's no nutritive value, just empty calories. This is not art. As to the reviewer who says that this album is good for sex, oh my god, are you kidding?!?! Sex with what?"
1,Kenny G(otta take some immodium to stomach this nonsense),"Pathetic -- You have to be kidding me if you are even reading this review. He is awful, consistenly out of tune, terrible, and basically a self absorbed ""wanna-bee."" You want to buy a Kenny G record, jump onboard with the World's Worst published musician..Give me a break and look fo something real...Please, Kenny Goerelic, better suited, Kenny D., as in DREADFUL. You SUCK!!!!"
1,"ONE BIG GOLD STAR FOR THE ""HAVANA"" TRACK!","Please, Artista, make that Kenny G. record one full CD's worth of ""Havana"" and ""Havana"" remixes--that is the only 'moment' I want from him, but what a moment it is!"
5,A Keeper,"The reviews are really polarized on this one, and I think it's because, while I like what Kenny G plays, it's not really jazz. It's more of a jazzy pop or something like that--or maybe how singers might sing if they could sing as quickly as Kenny G can play, and if they had the range of a saxophone.If you're into jazz, you probably won't like this, and if you're into rap/heavy metal you probably won't like it either. But if you like easy listening music--the kind that you can get lost in and that brings the most wonderful thoughts and images to mind--then you very well might like it."
3,Could've been better,"Kenny G is one of the best saxophonists in the world, but he certainly could've done better than this. As a sax player who tends to enjoy funk rock and romantic ballads, there are very few songs on this CD that appeal to me. ""Moonlight"" and ""Northern Lights"" are probably the closest to my favorite genres, but ""Gettin' on the Step"" is a cool, laid-back light swing tune. Unless you are a Kenny G collector, I would pass this CD over."
5,Kenny G,"I, too believe that Kenny G is the best saxophonist alive. There's something about the melodies he makes that's very magical. ""The Moment"" is the best compilation Kenny G has ever made and it's an album that always remains in my cd-player. I never got bored with it and I guess I never will.You like saxophone??? You must have Kenny G's cd's."
3,"Kenny G, ""The Moment""","Okay...I really wanted to like this, but only found about half of the tracks to my taste. A few are really good, others not too bad; some I've got to hit the ""forward"" button. Sample the tracks before you pony up the bucks; you may just want to download some to the I-Pod. But who am I, anyway? If you like Kenny G, you'll probably like this one, too."
5,"SUPERB MUSICIAN - Charles Scott Bennett ""Mr. Bennett"" U ARE CRAP AT MUSIC APPRAISAL",kenny gorelick is a highly talented saxophonist... and thats no understatement. its clear from his music... look at the complex runs and scales he uses. his technique is superb. now u mr bennett have no idea what you are talking about... i suggest you keep you mouth shut.
1,Urgh!!,"I may be getting a reputation as a Kenny G basher, but I can't help it. It's not like I haven't listened to his albums,...I own a few. One or two bought in my un-enlightened years, the rest were gifts by well meaning folks. I really have given this music a chance, but I am sorry, it does nothing for me. Every track sounds much like the other, and he's the only one I know who can make a tenor sax sound like a soprano. This music is so boring and soulless. It can't even lull me to sleep because it makes me tense. I have this cd on now to review it, and it's worse than nails scratching a blackboard...music is supposed to relax you or make you feel good. This music just makes me a nervous wreck. I just cannot take it no more."
1,i feel sick,"this really is horrible. i think kenny should have won and should win the elevator music of the year award for the past ten years. please do yourselves a favour and listen to coltrane, parker or brecker if you like ""sax"" and ""jazz"". if you like soft sloshy ""jazz"" get this CD straight away. please, PLEASE stop calling him the best sax player ever because he is NOT. if you' re interested in the Pat Metheny opinion on this ""musician"" ask me."
1,Film crew visits Alaska and films themselves,"The concept of this video is actually quite intriguing and about 5 of the 45 minutes is spectacular. The film crew seemed to be quite enamered with themselves. There are too many shots of them walking, standing, sitting, falling down and the backs of their heads. There are only a few unique locations in the film. When they visit a tram, we don't even get to see the view from the top of the mountain. Nearly the entire film is shot in 2D, but when it is 3D it is truly amazing. Not worth the price of admission by any means. Too bad because there are very view 3D selections available."
5,Great product,I bought these for use in a gym shower. They channel water perfectly and never make my feet feel sloppy. They air dry quickly and are dry and ready to use the next day.
2,Not comfortable but well aerated,"I agree with the other review, you initially don't find the ridges to be that uncomfortable but the more you wear it the less comfortable it becomes, it always makes a lot of squeeky noises on my flooring and loves to collect hair on the rubber ""gills"" on the bottoms. The only thing good about these is they do breathe and dry off quickly, they're good for the shower, pool or gym and they look cool but just aren't comfy. I wouldn't recommend for the beach, I can just imagine these things kicking up sand behind your legs and getting sand grains stuck in the mesh and irritating your feet lol..."
5,Great CD,"The people that gave this cd a one star rating dont like country music. They admit that in their review themselves. they have no business coming to this country music site and running down country music and insulting a great country music star. Trace Adkins is one of the best and his record sales prove it. He wouldnt have all those gold, platinum and multi-platinum albums if he wasnt good. If you like pop music then go to a pop music site and write a review about pop music. if you like rock music then go to a rock music site and write a review about rock music. if you dont like country music thats fine but dont insult country music fans and the artists that play our type of music. this is a great cd and i like every song on it. i definately give it a 5 star rating."
5,Trace's best cd,"This cd has great songs. Every one is awesome. He sings the most romantic song titled ""Baby I'm Home"". Oh, my, I would die if he sang that to me. He is so cool."
3,A Very Mixed Bag,"I like Adkins' voice and his previous CDs have been pretty good. This one, however, is a very mixed bag. The title song, ""Songs About Me"" has a good lyric and made a good single. ""Arlington"" is a good song that some will dislike because of their own political prejudices, but an objective listen to the song, sung from the perspective of a slain soldier, (""I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property ... I can rest in peace, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington"") reveals a terrific lyric.""Honky Tonk Badonkadonk"", a big hit, made for an amusing video but it isn't much of a song for listening purposes. I don't know if it will be released as a single, but ""I Wish It Was You"" is probably the best song on the CD. The rest of the songs fall into the category of decent filler - nothing terrible but nothing special, either. This CD will neither alienate Trace's fan base, nor expand it much.If allowed fractional ratings, I'd give this 3 & 1/2 stars"
2,Don't buy this!!,"I almost bought this CD. I am a big country fan and I especially like the song 'Songs about me.' What made me put it back was the song 'Arlington.' I am SO sick on country artists trying to cash in on the war and our soliders. As the wife of a solider, it seems anti-American. I hate the song itself. It glorifies dying and makes it seem romantic. For those of us who have to live with the thought everyday trust me it's not romantic. Don't support this!!!"
1,why country music sucks,"there is a reason why some people call country music the music of pain... trace atkins truly shows it on his ""hit song"". how anyone can even call that a good song is beyond me. lyrically, it's probably dumber than anything that paris hilton can come up with. someone says that this is the reason why country music is getting bigger and bigger... uh... i say it's the total opposite and it's the reason why people continue to say that country music sucks."
1,What is this crap?,I was unfortunate enough to hear this crap while flipping the channels the other day. What is this crap. They trying to make rap videos for Country music now? Next thing you know the cowboys are gonna be bustin caps. How retarded...
1,Song About me,"Without a doubt this is the worst singer I think I have ever heard. This album just proves it. ""Songs About Me"" is a terribly written and more importantly terribly sung song. It has no passion, and quite honestly I found it and his voice boring. I gave it one star because I didn't see any negative 5 stars.Don't buy it, it is obviously just someone who is out to sell a cd and doesn't care about vocals or content."
4,Trace Atkins at his best,Trace Atkins once again shows us how good he is. Arlington will touch the heart of everyone who has known and loved anyone in the armed services.
5,Songs About Me Another Platinum Album,"This album has the songs every one can relate to....Songs About Me is a song about everyone of us....Arlington is heart stopping and just beautifully done - there is no one that can sing this song like Trace with that deep baritone voice of his. It is a story of a soldier that lost his life and laid to rest at Arlington.Find Me a Preacher, My Way Back, I Wish It Was You, Bring It On, My Heaven, Baby I'm Home, Metropolis, I Learned How To Love From You, and Honky Tonk Badonkadonk......just all awesome in their own unique way.Need to release more singles from this....my recommendation for the next two singles would be Arlington and Honky Tonk Badonkadonk.Buy this CD and you will not be able to take from the CD player. Better pick up 2 or 3 copies of this one!!!!"
4,"Trace Adkins, Songs About Me",Great CD. Has made me a Trace Adkins fan. His voice and style grows favorably the more it is heard.
4,'Arlington' makes it worth the money,"Four stars because the other stuff on this album was OK but not stellar. 'Arlington', however, was off the scale. I had friends who died while serving in the military, so this one carries special weight for me. What made it most admiriable was that it was about duty to one's nation, and making sacrifices for others, without arguing either side of contemporary political issues. Not a good song to listen to while driving, as it tends to make one's vision a bit blurry."
2,Not too bad but a little sappy,"Another country album that falls into the trap of being too sappy. I have recently aquired a taste for some country music, but the level of religion in most country music is downright obnoxious. I just have a hard time getting into forced faith in my music. I know that christianity has long been a staple in country music, but it is really becoming stale and lame in the manner that it is being used anymore. That accompanied by the 'by the numbers' love songs are dragging the life out of too any potentially good CD's. Honky Tonk Badonkadonk is a cool song that has some balls to it though."
2,Superficial Guidebook,"Don't expect too much from this little guidebook. It's the kind of thing you would buy before making a quick stroll through the museum. Superficial at best, but worth a couple of bucks because it jams a lot of curious facts into a small space."
5,heart-breaking honesty,"This book took my breath away. I cannot believe there are so many women living with tragedies of such epic proportions and yet until now not permitted to voice their sorrow. Society tells us that women's rights are a priority, but this book shows the other side - that many women have been persuaded or co-erced into denying their right to have a healthy happy baby simply because it was seen as inconvenient to their partner or parents. It is time we listened to these heart-broken mothers, who are expected to go on with life as if nothing had happened.This book really opened my eyes to the cruelty of abortion."
1,Biased Book,The author is clearly pro life and I feel she has expoited these women. What are her qualifications? I suggest you locate a book written by someone who KNOWS about abortion.
4,Everyone can enjoy this,"Although I'm not into mainstream music, I have to make an exception in this case. I heard the song Four Leaf Clover on the radio by chance one day, and I went into the music store, had a listen to the rest of the songs, and bought it the same day. It has a great blend of rock and pop that is just easy to listen to. Most of the songs are faster paced, with a few exceptions that cannot be spoken poorly of. While I have sentimental reasons for liking this CD as well, it is something that everyone can easily enjoy because it was written for everyone."
5,I discovered her at Lilith...and now I'm hooked!,"After I bought the 1997 Lilith Fair compilation, I heard her song, ""Four Leaf Clover"", and since then, I was on a search to find her CD. She's apparently more popular in the midwest and south then she is around here (considering no one I knew or talked to had heard of her). But I found someone who could order it for me and I haven't stopped listening to it. She reminds me of Sheryl Crow, in that she can write about those itsy-bitsy individual things that I think about, and make them into beautiful songs. I'm going to order ""Sing""...never heard anything about it. I hope you all enjoy it!"
4,very good,I first heard the song Four Leaf Clover on the radio and I was hooked. I ended up buying the CD and really digging the drums on the tracks. A further review of the inside cover revealed that the drummer is a fella I used to run into in Austin Texas who played with David Garza in Twang Twang Shocka Boom. The whole CD is a great mix of easy to hard music. I think everyone will find tracks that they love and hate.
3,Its not bad.,"There are for sure some great tracks on this album, Id say about 5 of them. But the rest urge me to hit ""next track"" on my player. Just a little too much whining, not heartache, just whining."
2,Is the exam guide trust worthy?,"I agree with most of the guys that to pass the fourth exam (Build Internet Applications II) you need to prepare more than that is covered by this exam guide. For example it didn't mention a single word about Oracle Report but it did appear in the fourth exam. Even for those part that IS mentioned in this guide, you need to take extra care about the property palette details to pass the exam. Also I'd like to say this book is a bit hard to read, though it did help me to pass my third exam.Good luck for your exam!"
1,Incomplete information and duplicate with another book,"This book is ""copied"" from Part 3 and 4 of Oracle Certified Professional Application Developer Exam Guide. The authors for both books are same. I wonder why this book was published separately.The content does NOT cover the checklist of OCP Internet Application Developer, nor OCP Application Developer. For exam 1Z0-132, this book misses lots of important information and is a poor reference! Given an example, a critical exam point, ""Working with Oracle8 Ojbects in Forms Developer"" is not mentioned at all.For exam 1Z0-122, it is a little bit better, but still not complete and slightly out of date. For example, ""Defining Data Source"" and ""Working with Record Groups"" are incomplete."
1,Not enough to pass the OCP exam.,"This book does not cover the exam topic completely. The second part is nothing. This book could be a good introducing book on Internet application form building, but absolutely not for OCP preparation. This book gave not enough example to build Oracle forms with not clear explanation on important concepts, and usages. Persons get OCP only by this book actually does not learn some of Oracle."
2,This book is incomplete,"This book only covers about 2/3 of the material on the exam. It covers those 2/3 pretty well, but if you use nothing else to prepare for the exam, you will be in for a rude surprise when you take the exam.There are a handful of errors in the practice tests and some poor explanations, but this is a good book as PART of your preparation for this exam."
3,Good book but inadequate for exam.,"Although I have found the books format to be easy to work with, unfortunately, there are some discrepencies that lead you to believe that you will do better on the exam than in reality.In one instance, the author states that you only need 63% to pass the Building Internet Applications I exam when in fact you need 75%.The sample questions and sample exam that comes with the CD is completely inadequate as study material for the actual exam. The exam is much more difficult. The book and CD give you a completely false sense of security.The only reason that I rate the book as 3 instead of 2 or lower is that the content is actually not too bad and if the test questions or anything having to do with the test was adequate, I would rate it as 4 or higher."
4,"Good item, but not rated for 650 degrees","I'm generally pleased with this item, but am disappointed that it is NOT rated for 650 degrees as the Amazon description states. Rather, the tag states that it is only rated for 450 degrees. So, just take this into account before you buy."
3,Great construction,"Great construction, solid materials, good padding, nice length, but narrower at the mouth than I was expecting. I might have to make a 2 inch cut at the inside seam to allow my hands to get right in, not that I'm Popeye or anything. Other than that though, very nice mitts."
1,Burnt Through At 350F,"In addition to the comments by other users (too big, not as pictured), during the first week of use the mitt 'burnt through and through' at 350F without touching the oven filament. Cheap product from China."
2,oversized for our hands - no sizes to choose from,"we basically use this to handle hot utensils from lodge like cast iron dutch oven, able skiver and round griddle on a ceramic stove top.The cotton inner lining is good. It protects from heat.But is very big for our hands and not comfortable.Lodge(manufacturer) should make these available for different hand sizes.I ordered 2 pieces, but now use only 1 piece."
1,Not as pictured,Not tufted. Made for a giant. Not flexible. Not easy to hold items unless they are large.
3,It does what it says it does.,"This isn't actually a game, but something you can use to cheat at games. It works just like described. The only catch is that you need an XBOX memory card to do anything with it. BTW: this will only work for the original XBOX, not XBOX 360!Sick of getting killed over and over again in the same game? Want to unlock all the extras without spending weeks on the game? Use this product with your PC to load-up your memory card with game saves that can give you extra power-ups, weapons, etc. There are several game saves that come with the disc included and you can get more online through the software provided.The Gameshark hardware also works with Action Replay (similar product) software and save formats, you just need the Action Replay software (not included) to do it. The hardware itself is practically identical, so if you can get the Action Replay install disc, you're set for both!"
3,Great Gamesave device,"This is one of the best gamesave devices I have ever used. However, the software that comes with it seems to be uncompatiable with windows vista. It does work with windows xp/2000 without fault. Other than the uncompatiablity with vista this is wonderful cheat device for Xbox."
1,I never got this stupid thing to work.,"Maybe it was just me...I don't know. But I couldn't get this thing to work to save my life. I couldn't get a game to boot, nor could I get the online update deal. Or whatever it was. I just never could figure it out. Maybe it didn't work. Maybe I'm just a big dummy. I had a playstation and playstation 2 ones and those both worked out fine. But this one in particular...no dice."
1,Lame,"This book was a string of cliche's bound together with preachin' and propaganda. As an example of Christian literature, we are being short-changed."
5,Thanks,"I'm not a huge fan of B and D, even though I did see them grocery shopping together in Nashville when I lived there years ago. But, I give this 5 stars since I read that their record company insisted that they trim the songs down to the standard 10-12 songs per disc, and B and D had the cojones to insist on keeping these 19 songs. That kind of regard for the fans certainly deserves 5 stars, and yes, with so many songs on the disc, you will find several that you like. (The ones I cannot listen to often are those sung by Brooks. Ronnie Dunn is incredible). Thanks go to B and D for making this album worth our money."
5,Complete Hits Collection,"This album contains all the hits from Brooks & Dunn. This album is a fantastic deal. You get 19 of their hits, which all them have been heard on the radio. Great Value!"
5,Dependable Excellence,"I am convinced these guys can do no wrong. This CD has been out for a while and I can already see a Vol 2 well in the works! You can hear their music evolve over almost 10 years. It always gets better, but you never lose the love of the old stuff! These guys are as dependable as can be when it comes to every track, every song. No such thing as 2 or 3 good tracks amidst mindless filler. You just know with these two cowboys that every album is dependable, fantastic country music in solid Brooks and Dunn style, but always refreshingly different from anything else they've made before. Spectacular CD, worth every penny, can't wait for Vol 2!!!"
5,a must have,for total honky tonk feel good/sad/angry this one is a winner.....for lyrical content and total production get it
3,Sorry to see them break up,i enjoy some of their music but not all. Overall the music is good on this cd.
5,brooks n' done are true cow boys,"after listining to this allbum i found that brooks n' done are making country country agane...if it wasnot for brooks n' done the boogy woogy country that is so big now can not have never have not happened, grate classiks like the water mellon crawl can never have not been big if it was never four these guys, brooks n' done...chers maites!"
1,Inaccurate and shallow,"This lightweight booklet is terribly researched with numerous factual errors, particularly in the first four chapters. Later, when giving buying advice, it assumes you are a low-credit, high-risk buyer. A much better book is John Grissim's."
2,English Assignment Gone Wrong!!!,"Our class had to do ""The Chrysalids"" for an English Assignment. It was very confusing, and should not be given to grade 9 students. I mean, he falls in love with his cousin, that's really sick. Anyways. if you're a teacher don't make your students read it."
2,BORING!!!,"As if anyone could give this book a good review. Did the author write all of the reviews, or something? What a bore! Of all the books I have ever read, this is the absolute worst. It lacks the quality of keeping the attention of the reader. I bet even English lecturers would not know at the end of the book what it was about, because they would have been 3/4 asleep the whole time. Yeah, great, some kids can communicate using there heads. Well, how very exciting!!!"
1,inappropriate for children,"This is a book many children aged nine or ten to twelve or so might enjoy, but I would not have my own read it and I don't recommend you have yours read it. It teaches them the wrong lessons. It tells us that problems are best ignored, that you don't have to ever grow up if you don't want to. It encourages xenophobia and paranoia (in the popular, non-clinical sense of the word) and--I don't know how to put this delicately--cold-blooded violence. (Although the adult psyche will probably prove impervious, I recommend it for only those adults with a high tolerance for simplistic drivel and badly constructed prose.)"
1,I was forced to read this book,my english class an i had to read this book ! the only interesting part is that David is in love with his cousin! haven't teachers ever heard about child abuse? i would give this book 0 stars if it were an option ! *IF YOU ARE A TEACHER THINKING OF ASSIGNING THIS BOOK PLEASE THINK AGAIN*
5,Very good book...,"I've read that book in English and it was a bit difficult for me, because I am from Slovakia and I know Slovak language best and English less.It was interresting for me, good story and idea.As I read it I felt such a wonderful kind of tension inside of my soul. As I've read it I've thought about a life too. It seems to be that nothing has changed and nothing will. People are same all the time - in the past and in the future. Only what matters is love inside of human, not laws, not orders made by some unwise and ignorant people... People long for peace, David, Petra, Sophie... too. Some of them has found what they looked for, some of them didn't. It's sad but such is a story... Nothing stays for always at the same place, everything changes..."
4,Chrysalids review,"Read this book as a young kid and loved it then. Wasn't sure if it would still hold the same appeal, and was pleasantly surprised that it's still a great read and for such an old book, it seems to be more relevant today than it was when it was penned. Recommened for any one who loves the post apocalyptic genre."
4,Still A Good Story,"This book was originally written in a Cold War world and, I think, concerned with what a post-nuclear war world might look like. Our world has changed a bit since then, but it has changed in ways that play into the storyline. Specifically, we are seeing the rise of hyper-conservative religions around the world that are increasingly intolerant of differences. It is frighteningly easy to imagine the society in this book coming into existence. Wyndham's book was decades ahead of its time."
3,Thought provocing.. but horrible!,While this novel (which I happened to read in Grade 10 English) made one think... it also was also very critical of the relligous beliefs of today.. our teacher told us of how it was a satire on Christianity... and I found it very dissapointing...
3,Interesting...,"We read this in grade 7, and I enjoyed it very much. It gets slow at times, but nonetheless, a great book for science fiction lovers (of which I'm not). Interesting plot, the characters are a little shallow."
4,One of Wyndham's best,"How do you survive in a repressive world if you are different -- especially if your difference is telepathy, and the society around you totally lacks imagination. That is the problem that David and similarly gifted children of his generation must face in the post-apocalyptic, rural, restrictively religious society they inhabit, in which deviance is apt to be punished with death. Wyndham effectively conveys what it's like to carry a secret, the solace of finding others like yourself, and, in this case, the suspensefully described dangers of exposure. The telepathic interchanges are evocative and believable, and the claustrophobia of circumstances from which it's impossible to see a way out becomes tighter and tighter until the final rescue. A wonderful allegory of freedom and individuality packaged in good writing. Ranks among Wyndham's best novels along with The Day of the Triffids, The Midwich Cuckoos, and The Kraken Wakes."
4,I still remember it.,I read this book almost 25 years ago and still remember it well. I was the type of book that really made you think about how society can be prejudiced be your look and how it make those people feel. I loved it.
5,A strong voice against bigotry and hatred,"In the post-apocalyptic world, after a nuclear war, there's no place for mutants or for who or what is different from ""the plan of God"". Religious bigotry and paranoia are taught from childhood in the little village in which the novel is aet, but David will find that i's wrong to cling at static norms, that ""Life is change"" and that diversity is a richness to be treasure. He and his friensa will flee the bigotry addle village to a land of liberty. a lesson for our times."
4,Great read,This is a book that I read as a child and I was very thrilled to get my hands on it again: It met all of my expectations.
5,Fine book!,Addresses the issue of being different in a society that recognizes only homogeneity. Beautifully written and has an excellent pace.
1,not the book you thought,"The Chysalids (Connections) is not the novel The Chrysalids by John Wyndham. I bought it thinking it was and am now returning it.This book is a play based on the book. It may or may not be good in its own right, but is not the novel and that is why I am giving it a 1 star only.I read the novel years ago and it is one of the best that Wyndham wrote. If you can find the novel, read it"
3,I enjoyed it,Book is really short and has such a great topic i wish they had added more on the whole nuclear post era and the whole not being perfect bit.. it did have a weird but good ending though i enjoyed it
5,Paralising!,"Hello, I am just one of the many teenagers who have read theChrysalids novel. Now, with this new curriculm, they decided that thiswould be the novel that all grade nines students would read within my district. As, I heard reviews from my class, it was basicly a big confusion. To make it clear, I heard in one review that a man compared telepathy to thought shapes. That is incorrect. It is simply 'thought shapes,' not messages or brain waves, just thought shapes. In our modern world telepathy is possible but not thought shapes and that is what make Chrysalids different and interesting. It is hard to understand the book at times, and I agree that there should have been a sequel. I reccomend that you should be mature enough to read and understand this book, and if not then you will be lost. Over all, it was quite wonderful!"
5,Great book,"At first I didn't like it when I read it in highschool at the age of 15; but now, at 31, I have come to appreciate it more. This scenario could come to pass. Maybe it's too deep for some students."
3,The Chrysalids,"The scene is set up in the future after an imaginary nuclear war, then humans somehow develop into mutuants, yea something like X-men. However most of the characters in the story are children which more or less make the story something like the adventure of tom sawyer"
4,Super Reader,"Here we have the book that most likely influenced John Wagner to some degree with Judge Dredd's Cursed Earth.In this society there is much genetic deviation, and the chance of getting a baseline human birth is low.Mutant or different children are supposed to be killed at birth, but this of course is not always the case, humans being what they are.A group of such mutant children have developed superhuman abilities, and decide to flee. Far from being deformed, these children, by evolution, are superior to the 'norms', as standard humanity comes to be seen."
4,"scifi classic, redux","I read this last in the summer of 1985, as required summer reading for school. It's intended mostly as an exploration of the ideas of racial purity, vs. evolution and mutation, using the characters (humans who have the mutant ability of telepathy) as the exploration vehicle. The story is set in Labrador, in Canada, following what looks like a rather destructive nuclear war, with the society that survives having some rather puritanical religious views on genetic purity. Back when I first read the book, I took the story as being rather one-sided, in favour of the mutants, but now I read it as more evenly balanced. John Windham was one of my favorite authors, back in the early 1980s, and I am a big fan of The Day of the Triffids, which I re-read back in 2004."
4,"""Rebirth"" = ""The Chrysalids"".","""Rebirth"" is in fact the very same book as ""The Chrysalids"". Someone must have figured the new title would sell better. Either way, it's an excellent book. Reminds me A LOT of ""A Night of Watching"", the story of Denmark under the Nazis. That was true, this is fiction, but human nature - good and bad - doesn't change, and is realistically and lovingly portrayed here. Real villians, real heroes. I always hoped they would go back for the girls. Yes, we need a sequel!Definitely recommended. Read it soon."
1,THIS BOOK STINKS!,"""So dumb I felt retarded after reading it"" - me""So boring I fell asleep thinking about it"" - me""So crappy I felt dirty from touching it"" - me""So awful a gave it to my nemesis for christmas!"" - me""If you are a masochist, read this book!"" -some guyOh did I mention that I hated this book. All of these people giving it more than 1 or maybe stretching it to 2 stars obviously live holes or something where there are no good books! John Wynkham should really consider rewriting the ending and spend more that 3minutes thinking about a resolution. I mean killing people with a polymer that doesn't explode come on!"
1,sad,"I would just let this alone--used bookstores are littered with this sort of stuff--but it's rather disconcerting to discover that public school teachers are actually assigning children to read it. It has no literary merit whatsoever, and those persons who can't see this are welcome to enjoy it nevertheless, but they should not be teaching English."
1,This book sucks,"This is the worst book ever. John Whyndham is a big failure. If it were up to me, this book would never be taught in school again. The whole book was entirely boring and the ending was retarded. Please do not read this book."
1,This was a disapointment,"I am a grade 9 student and the class did a group book report on this novel. It was awful, it was overated as a classic. No I don't hate it because it was forced apon me, it was a week book. The ending was odd and much to fast. There was a big lead up to nothing. The climax was a black hole of emptyness. When written it may verywell have been good but it was not up to todays standards. There are so many better recent books I have read. No I'm not dumb I have a 92% in english and a 96% average. I feel we should let the book die and pick up a new book published in this decade. Support the new authors not the dead ones."
1,Horrible book,"i as a yr 9 student and have been forced to read this as the compulsary skool curriculum. this book is not one of those action packed, fire fight, action hero type novels. all in all this was THE most devastatingly lowest of low sci-fi novels i have eva read."
1,"The ""Connections"" version is not the book!",It has been munged into a pre-teen play. The book itself is fantastic but don't bother with this version.
1,Get the original book instead,"I read the original in Grade 9, and it is a fantastic book. Probably for all ages above 12 - but especially good for teenagers. I don't see why anyone should get this abridged version if you can find the original ""The Chrysalids"" by John Wyndham. Amazon.com doesn't seem to have it listed, so go to your local library. (or double check if Amazon has since added it)."
3,OKAY,I believe that The Chrysalids is an interesting book proposed to kids our age (14-16). It offers strong and complicating emotions; however many teens will not b able to completly understand this book. UNLESS YOU ARE A SCI-FI FAN DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK !
3,A thought provoking read,"I also had to read this book in high school, but I don't have a personal copy. (I'm going to get one thanks to Amazon). I look forward to reading it again."
5,I never knew fantasy could be so captivating!,"Presently I am in grade seven and was given a book critique to write. Myself, I am a science-fiction hater and fantasy hater. My brother recommended this book to me. I reluctantly began. Once I began I could not stop. Simply a masterpiece!"
4,"Pretty, but stone is not beatiful itself","The pendant is really well designed, it's very pretty. I just did not like the stone (malachite), it was a bad bead."

4,A welcome World Party return...,"This album has some very strong performances from Kurt, and a welcome return back to the form of 'Goodbye Jumbo' and 'Bang'.I felt on 'Egyptology' he really had nothing to say...good, safe melodies with absolutely no lyrical depth. This album finds him back to true form. Inspired Lyrics, strong melodies that grab you from the very first listen.Don't be thrown off by the opening track...the rest of the album is nothing like it. In fact, after the first few listens I've programmed out the 1st and last song, which seem a little out of place with the rest of the album.This album should be well received by critics and loyal fans, and should gain him some new ones along the way."
5,Great,"The best way to describe World Party is they sound like the Beatles if Bob Dylan and Prince were band members.There is not a bad or mediocre World Party, although out of the five this one is probably their 2nd best (after Goodbye Jumbo). If you are new to World Party, this is a great place to start - highly recommended."
3,"sorry, but...","Since ""Goodbye Jumbo"", I've waited for each successive World Party release and, alas, none of them have been half as good. I hate to be so negative - especially since I appear to be a minority here - but I strongly advise at least listening to this cd before buying it. It's possible that it'll grow on me in time (hence three stars), but... well, I kinda doubt it."
3,A Mistep from a Promising Artist,"""Dumbing Up"" starts off badly with what may be Karl Wallinger's worst recording, the annoying faux hip-hop ""Here Comes the Future."" Although the rest of the album is much more listenable, it seems as though Wallinger is running out of new ideas. While World Party's music is sometimes called derivative, here the label really fits. ""Another 1000 Years"" takes ""Beatlesque"" to the extreme, while ""Who Are You?"" and ""Always on My Mind"" are almost note-for-note impersonations of Dylan and Mick Jagger, respectively (right down to their vocal inflections). While Wallinger certainly picks some great artists to imitate, I'd much rather hear some of the truly original trad-rock of ""Goodbye Jumbo"" or ""Egyptology."""
3,"What's up with this ""new"" release? Can't we just call it a re-issue?","I've heard this ""new record from World Party"" mentioned a few times on KRCW's ""Morning Becomes Eclectic,"" which I listen to on the web.Well...I bought this record around six years ago, when it was originally released, in fact as a CD import from Amazon.So...I'm not really sure what the point of re-issuing this is.(Couldn't the two new tracks here have just been released as a single or an EP?)As a consumer and World Party fan, probably would say my main reaction at this point is one of utter curiosity--but hey, I did go back into my pile of old CDs at home, fish the old one out, and even listened to it again for old time's sake! (And ""Another 2000 Years"" is still a really powerful, great track!)"
4,SOLID EFFORT,"Glad I was able to find this in the good old U.S. of A and I agree it is a shame that it is import only. I will be the first to admit there is a sameness to this c.d. with previous World Party efforts. The question would be is that a bad thing? Melodic songs with meaningful lyrics that stick in your mind and as retro and derivative as it all may be, nobody makes this kind of music anymore. I thank my lucky stars World Party is still around to bring us music like this."
5,"for beatles, stones and dylan lovers","this guy is just great. yes he sounds like mick jagger and one song is a partial steal from the beatles' ""Baby You're a Rich Man"", and yes one song sounds just like one of Dylan's songs circa ""Highway 61 Revisited"" and yet.....the songs are GREAT. This is such a quality album, with tremendous, brilliant lyrics and great production. And the last song, a diatribe against every last thing that's wrong with our so-called civilization is exhilerating in its rage and truth, you may find yourself laughing out loud in recognition.World Party just keeps getting better."
5,Not available in the USA!?,If you can't go down to your local record store and buy a new album this good in this country maybe it is time we all moved back to our ancestor's country of origin and leave the place to the bison (that is a buffalo for those of you who weren't awake for school.)Jeez I can get a whole case of the Red Hot Chili Peppers if I wanted to. But why on earth would I even want one copy. (coaster perhaps?)
5,an Authurian legend story like no other,"This novel blends fiction, history and legend into a story that brings to life a new aspect of the legends of Arthur and the Round Table.The story is told through Lin, who along with her brother Dafydd was born into slavery. The book is of her story, coming of age in a cruel world; of being abused and violated by the kings and queens she was born to serve. Yet through the story, Lin never loses her spirits. She, unlike the other slaves, questions her destiny. She can't accept her life, and she doesn't understand why the others are so passive about it. I came to admire her spirit and spunk; her actions are rebellious and never submissive. She stands up for what she believes in.Through time we learn all of Lin's story, and how it ties her to the legendary King Arthur. The story is a different twist on the Arthurian legends, and one that I enjoyed the entire way through. I couldn't put it down. It's engrossing, entertaining and very well written.Two thumbs up."
2,"A good read, but actually quite boring...","That's not really much action in this book. Some of the reasons is that Freddy is in only about 75-90 pages in the entire story. Another reason is that Freddy really don't kill anyone (besides a ""Died in a car accident""-death in the start where Freddy was involved), but a 17-old Jerome Starkey, which body is possesed (or something like that) by a evil-him created by Freddy. Also, there is some parts in the story, that does not fit in ""A Nightmare On Elm Street""-story (like when ""evil Jerome"" dress up as Jason Voorhees).Besides that, Tim Waggoner really shows which gret author he is in ""Protege"". The book is full of good descriptions and sentence like ""His laughter died, and a few seconds later, so did he"" and he really makes a good mood whenever something ""special"" happen (which really not is often).If you're a fan of Tim Waggoners novels, this is a excellent choice for a boring weekend, just don't expect some real action before after 150 pages."
4,"Not that sexy, but definitely comfy!","After several years of living in Florida, my feet were paying the price for wearing flip-flops every day. I switched to these Clarks for a more foot-friendly sandal, and the pain in my feet has gone away!"
5,"Love, love, love Clarks shoes!","Got these shoes in every color available. Fit perfectly..no pinching. Plus, the design is really cool!"
3,not really sure yet.,"today, i finally decided to throw down the 15 bucks for ""hidden treasures"". i've read fantastic reviews for this album, and all the reviewers on amazon.com seem to like it. so i sprung for it.it's taking a little while to sink in. i immeadiately liked the remix, or reconstruction of the tweaker song ""linoleum"". i think it is great. but, after that, i'm not sure. i'm sure it will grow on me, like a fungus, until it becomes an edidble mushroom, capable of taking my mind to new places. but, until then, i'll give it 3and1half stars."
3,"Bright, but not HID-like/white","I replaced my stock lights with these when my stock bulbs failed. I wasn't looking for the ""HID-like"" or ""white light"" kinda of bulbs but when I saw these bulbs advertised as ""HID-like"", I thought ""why not!"".Anyway, long story short, there are NOT HID-like or white. They are quite yellow, something between ""streetlight yellow"" and HID. I have a friend who replaced his regular H7 halogen bulbs with the ""Sylvania H7 Cool Blue Halogen 55W"" (a cousin of this bulbs..) and those are definitely more HID-like/white light. Don't be fooled by the ""cool blue"", its not blue, its percieved as white.Bottomline: If you're looking for just brightness, go for these, if you want brightness AND the HID-like/whitelight look, then buy the ""Sylvania H7 Cool Blue"" ... I'm looking for them !"
3,maybe too compact,The case is nice enough but maybe too compact; it held less than my murano computer bag but because of its wheels was too big to fit under the airplane seat.
2,Not for the road warrior,"I've just returned mine. This is a decent medium grade bag, but will clearly will not hold up if you are on the road weekly, like I am. The handle loosened up quite a bit on my first trip and the wheels are not comparable to superior brands."
5,Kensington Bag,"An OUTSTANDING bag at a GREAT price... Fits in 99% of aircraft overheads, will not fit in a CRJ200 overhead, but I'm not sure anything larger than a lunch box will. If you find the bag will not fit in the overhead due to the width of the wheels, position the wheels so they're up towards the top of the overhead... The handle position and weight distribution is perfect for me (6'1""). I had no problem loading my lap top, toiletries and change of clothes in this bag (not shoes). I would for sure buy another one as some competitors are nearly twice the price, for a ""name"" and not an increase in quality (my opinion). The warranty sounds really nice as well, however I've not had to use it (after 4 months). Cheers!"
3,Kensignton Bag,"The item works okay, but the handle makes it almost impossible to carry an additional item with it. Cannot stack an additional bag on top of the roller bag. The overnoight section opens from the top rather than the side, which makes it harder for packing and unpacking.It gets the job done, but is not as convenient or as user friendly as my older model bag did."
1,ppor quality handle broke after 2 months,"The plastic handle broke after 2 months, the bag is on smaller size, you can compare it to 75% on the size of normal 21"" case"
4,Very impressive!,"This is the notebook case I've been waiting for! I make frequent international trips and, until now, I've tried stuffing a few critical carry-on items into my regular laptop case. That amounted to little more than a toothbrush. The Kensington Contour case is ""real"" overnight bag, built around my notebook. Large enough for my 17 inch screen, it has room to spare for all of my essentials and a change of clothing. After filling it to capacity, it remains amazingly compact. It wheels easily through narrow airplane isles and fits neatly into the overhead compartment. The only negative comment I would make is that the handle is uncomfortable between the fingers after wheeling it through the airport. If the padding was a little better it would have earned a 5 star rating."
3,Good but flawed,"The basic concept and design would rate five stars if execution were not flawed. The zipper pulls sacrifice function and durability for style. In the course of just one trip to Asia, have already had one pull come off. The bag could also use a shoulder strap for those inevitable situations (climbing stairs and negotiating narrow aisles) when you can't roll the thing."
5,Excellent!,"I take about 25 rountrip flights a year, and needed a ""roller"" that was flexible and durable. This is it! It has enough pockets to store the small items and enough protection for my laptop and digital camera. It is also roomy enough to pack clothes for an overnight trip."
3,Build Quality and Zippers Not Up to Par - Have They Improved?,"I bought this bag in June 2011 after owning the Contour Roller for several years. I liked the design of this bag better than the Contour Roller, but the build quality of this new bag was worse. Especially the outside zippers, which were flimsy, easy to jam, zippers with inferior pulls -- nothing like was shown in the product photos. I returned the bag to Amazon for a refund. I still love the bag and would buy another if I could be assured the build quality, including zippers, is up to the old standard. Does anybody know?"
2,My unit fell apart after 4 months,"BOTH handles on this case have broken. The plastic handles cannot stand up to normal wear and tear. The case was not too bad, but now it is useless. I will be returning it to Kensington."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"From the picture on Amazon this product appeared to be of good quality. Four (4) weeks after we purchased the item some of the stripping at the bottom of the bag peeled off. I was unable to return the item because I had it just over the four weeks. I decided to keep the product and about 3 weeks from that date, one (1) of the handles broke on the item and left me with just the one handle to lift the item with. Five (5) months later the last handle finally broke off the product. I used this bag solely for the purpose of carrying my laptop and supplies. I am very disappointed in the quality of item given the amount of money requested."
1,very weak&funny,Mack 10 is good for a laugh.these lyrics&music are played out like 5 years back.i hear Cube pulling the strings here and that's one of the reasons why he has fallen off so bad.trying to give a 3rd tier rapper 2nd rate Rhymes.and the guests alone don't make no sense.
3,Stay true to your hard core audience!,"I was very disappointed with Mac 10's new album because as many people have commented there are just too many guest appearances. If I wanted a compilation album, I'll buy Flex's album or Ant Bank's joint. I consider myself to be a hard core Mac 10 fan and find myself wondering why the sudden change in his approach. I understand artists want to make as much money as possible in a short time but I think Mac 10 is going about it the wrong way. Stay true to the game as his mentor Cube talked about on Death Certificate. It doesn't come fast and easy, ask E-40, he's been in the game for a while and he's just now getting the props he deserves but he didn't do it by changing his style up. He stayed true to his hard core fan base which is what MAC ONE-O needs to do."
4,This new album is out cold!,"Mack 10 is the shizznit! If you like hip hop and rap you better get this album. It features just about everyone who is hot right now. Mack sounds better than ever on this one, but he shouldn't have tried to get down with Buckshot and ODB cuz they stole the show. The Terror Squad also represents on another fat track. You can't say they didn't get down on that song."
3,Decorate and Accessorize using Feng Shui,"Practical Feng Shui: Arrange, Decorate and Accessorize Your Home to Promote Health, Wealth and HappinessThis handy feng shui book is probably not the best bet for the beginner, however as an adjunct to the feng shui library, it offers valuable advice on designing areas of the home to be in harmony. Specific details on items such as table settings will be of special interest. Furniture placement according to energy and room alignment will also be helpful.Many photos and illustrations showing colors, furniture styles, placement, even fabric types are listed throughout."
4,Good Resource for the Intermediate or Advanced Feng Shui Person,This is a comprehensive book that is best for someone who is already grounded in Feng Shui. It stresses more traditional approaches to Feng Shui that will make more sense to someone who is beyond an introduction to Feng Shui or just beginning to dabble in it. There is a lot of helpful info in this book that an intermediate or advanced student of feng shui can readily understand and make use of in the home.
5,Best Feng Shui Book,"I have many books on Feng Shui, and this is the best, most practical, and most coherently organized."
2,"Good Pictures, but some material not accurate","The most important rule in Feng Shui is directions. They need to be accurate by using a compass. Your Kua Number or (Ki Number) gives you your personal direction which then designates where the proper placement of colors, objects and Feng Shui enhancers are placed in your surroundings. I think most people do not understand that Feng Shui can be detrimental if not applied properly. Never in a home is a missing corner or extension to a building beneficial."
5,"Nice tone, good feel, comfortable size","My headline says it all really. The tone is full but crisp, the sticks themselves have a nice solid feel and they fit my hands nicely.No complaints and very pleased."
4,"Inexpensive claves, but good sound for the price","These are not the claves to end all claves, but sound very decent. I've used them in a wide variety of musical applications with great success. They are very durable and sturdy and have not broken down at all.Unless you absolutely need the best pair of claves money can buy, go for these!"
4,On the brighter side,"These seem to be fine- haven't used mine much yet. The pair I got sound to me like they produce a brighter more piercing sound than some claves I've heard. If you need something with some cut these are a good choice. If you're expecting a more mellow ""woody"" tone these aren't for you."
5,GREAT BOOK! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!,"GREAT BOOK, I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND, AND I DISCOVERED EXCITING AND LIBERATING THINGS ABOUT MYSELF FROM READING IT! SOME GREAT DRAWINGS AND ILLUSTRATIONS TOO.THE AUTHORS ARE GREAT STORYTELLERS. THEY SEEM VERY REAL AND DOWN TO EARTH. I FEEL THEY HAVE GREAT LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING AND COMPASSION.AS YOU READ YOU FIND YOURSELF NODDING IN AGREEMENT. ONCE STARTED YOU CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT THE NEXT PRINCIPLE OF TRANSFORMATION IS OR HOW IT WILL HELP YOU IN YOUR LIFE. I EVEN BROUGHT IT INTO WORK WITH ME. I WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE. THIS BOOK CHANGES THE WAY YOU PERCIEVE THINGS. THE CHANGES ARE ALL FOR THE BETTER. YOU WILL NEVER REGRET BUYING ""WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK""!I FEEL MORE ENERGY AND MORE HAPPINESS AFTER READING IT! I FEEL LESS JUDGEMENTS AGAINST MYSELF. WHAT THEY SAY IS SIMPLE BUT TRUE! I AM GETTING THIS BOOK AS A GIFT FOR ALL MY FRIENDS!"
5,A Book's Work,"I wholeheartedly recommend the Kane's book ""Working on Yourself Doesn't Work."" I found it to be straight forward and accesible as well as an infinitely helpful map on this bumpy road called life. I say the more tools the better. The Kanes, however, remind us that we cannot erase the past but that we can wrestle with it so that it doesn't determine (i.e sabotage) our future. The Kane's book provides useful tips and examples on how to navigate through our own psyche as well for dealing with the world at hand. They have a nice writing style that is both personal and informational.I believe there is something for everyone in this book and is a great affirmation for being ourselves. And who wouldn't like that?"
2,"Heavy on well-treaded theories, light on practical excercise","When I first started to read this book, I thought it was going to be a great one. I was highlighting this, and marking that. Alas, it fell pretty flat as example after example seemed to be added to simply fill a book. Too bad, because I liked the direction it was headed, but some direction/excercises on how to do that NOW thing would have been helpful. I guess you need to take their workshops for that. And what's with the trademark every time the 'instantaneous transformation' words came together? Kinda cheap, in my opinion."
1,Not worth your money,"I bought this book while browsing through the self-help section.I read it in two days. And after having finished it and putting it down, I felt like: 'And now what?'I have read a number of self-help books and I can say this one comes at the bottom of the list.The authors did not come up with any original ideas, only rechewed ideas, put in different terms, that others have already addressed. The book is not even that well-written.So please, do not spend the money you worked so hard for on this book. There are other books or tapes well worth it, but this isn't the one.One VERY SERIOUS criticism I have is: People that have gone through traumatic situations in life, DO need the help of a therapist, maybe even combined with some chemical treatment. And even remotely suggesting that just concentrating on being here and now, and finding a way around your W.O.R.M's will do it??? Come on. That is totally irresponsable.This book is definately a thumbs down."
2,Vague,I found this book to be very vague. The basic message seems to be that one should feel their feelings a basic principle of psychotherapy. They also convey that feeling your feelings or living in the moment requires no effort. I strongly disagree with this point. When myriads of negative messages are sitting in one's psyche it takes a consious effort to deal with them. Typical of their over simplified approach is that one needs to forgive to be able to live in the moment. If forgiveness was this easy we'd all be doing it. In an idealistic state they are correct that living in the moment is the goal. The road to getting there they completely ignore leaving the reader sime vague hints about letting go.
1,Horrible,"I felt like this book was a total waste of money. I can't believe all the positive reviews about it are for real - it doesn't seem like anyone who has actually read it and who has also read any of the great ""self improvement"" authors could ever think this book was anything but a poor imposter. These folks gave it a good try, but they are just stating the obvious and repackaging very old, common practices of self-improvement. Even the title is silly - they tell you that working on yourself doesn't work when they have been working hard on themselves for decades!"
2,Falls Flat,"I received my copy of ""Working On Yourself..."" around 6 o'clock this evening. Two hours later I've now finished the book...Seriously. This book has no follow through. Once I read the theory I wanted to know how others USED this book. It never happened. This is a book with style and no substance.Comments such as ""What I resist, persists and goes stronger"" are not new.I kept waiting for some great insight to be presented but it never was. If you had goals and wanted to improve your life -create more prosperity and health in your life- this book would not be helpful.One final comment. The size of the type is almost painfully small. The Kanes need a better book designer."
1,we've heard it before and better,"This book was a disappointment! We have heard it all before, only it has been said better. To save you the trouble of buying this very short book (the advertising section for their other books and workshops is about as long as one of their few chapters)I sum it up for you:Live in the present,don't judge or critizise, just notice what happens, and the feeling will go away, don't resist emotions etc etc Some stories to illustrate their points are outright ridiculous,e.g.,the author gets a nasty burn on her leg while riding a motorcycle (and goes on and on about how much it hurt) but instead of going to a doctor she sits around hurting all day long, takes another bike-ride, puts a little ice on the wound and learns to live through the pain by visualizing its colour and how much water would fit into it (one of their principles- take whatever feeling comes and live it!)Not worth your time or your money!"
2,Zen for Life,"This is an easy-to-read and interesting book but the reader may need to be familiar with Zen to get the most from the authors' approach. Read instead the full text of The Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr. It is available online and the concepts are easier to grasp. Add to that Ralph Waldo Emerson's advice to ""live each day as though it were your last, yet as though you had a thousand years."" That's really all the advice you need."
1,Vague and Rambling,"I had high expectations after reading the reviews but I found the book to be a total waste of money. In my opinion, the book was extremely vague and rambling sort of like one of Wade Cook's book's on investing. Like Wade Cook's books it seemed to be a primer to sell more expensive seminars rather than offering any real concrete advise. If you are looking for a simple concise self help book, I highly recommend The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, it's a keeper."
3,"O.K., just O.K.","It should have been half the price (or even less). An easy read - I read it thru in just a couple of hours. But like one other reader said, this book could have easily been a magazine article. The three transformational principles were not profound. Personally, I've already realized these things if not thru my own experiences, definitely thru other readings. This book just reinforced basically what I already knew."
1,Working on Yourself Doesn't Work Doesn't Work,"The only thing that does work is the title. But of course, the book is about completely the opposite, i.e. how to work at not working!So, just another self-help book thinly disguised as a non-self-help book.Interestingly, a book that does pay off on this book's title goes under the title Radical Self-Acceptance,by Tara Brach. Check it out: self-acceptance is the real deal. It's the key to living in the moment."
3,Entirely Not Lifechanging,"This was hardly worthwhile, and certainly you can do better with alternative selections in the category."
3,simplistic,This book offers nothing that I have not already read and studied. It is similar to basic Buddhist teaching. One must accect themselves as they are and peacefully co-exist with unpleasant qualities. This book is helpful but not great.
1,Light on content and explanation,"I purchased this book because a reviewer referenced this in relation to Eckhart Tolle's THE POWER OF NOW. It was a hugh disappointment. If you have never been exposed to anyone such as Deepak Chopra, Eckhart Tolle, Ken Wilber, or other insightful people, may-be it would serve as an introduction. The authors basically fit a brochure into the space of a book by double spacing, including useless drawings, and leaving lots of blank spaces. Skip this and go right to the THE POWER OF NOW."
5,A TRULY WONDERFUL BOOK,"From a couple in New York City. We highly recommend Working on Yourself Doesn't work to anyone looking for satisfaction in their life. We both read the Kane's book a few months ago, and loved it. Last night, we picked it up again and we rediscovered it. We were filled with warmth, and with a new look on life: that life can be easy, simple, and fulfilling. We won't reveal how, rather, we encourage you to buy the book and read it more than once. Enjoy!"
2,Vague and oversimplified,"This book has some great ideas, but they aren't exactly new: you must forgive others to truly be free, live in the moment, be self aware. These ideas are valid but that's about all you get from the Kanes. There is virtually no explanation of how to get there from here. There are a lot of other books that do a better job of explaining these concepts."
1,Muddled and Boring,"I bought this book because of some of the good reviews on Amazon.com. What a mistake! The book is muddled, boring, and virtually unreadable. Don't waste your money."
5,Japanese style to the max!,"These magazines are great for those who enjoy the lifestyle and look of the young Japanese culture. The magazines are full of beautiful photos of both street and stylish clothing, make-up, hair, and the latest in everything. Even if you don't read Japanese, these magazines can give you great ideas and are a treat for the eyes!"
1,Vague and sloppy logic,"Undue influence is good if you are a a fan of red scare McCarthyism. This book demonizes people who place the health of communities and ecosystems above the profit motives of companies. This book is a sad reminder that the environmental movement needs to reach out to more people especially in rural America where folks are skeptical of conservation measures.This book supports increased mining, clear-cutting of ancient forests, and destruction of habitats for profit. Very disturbing material."
1,Blatant disregard for logic or accuracy,"As a professional scientist working in a biological discipline, I can assure you that this book is neither accurate nor even logical at times. Facts are grossly inaccurate or intentionally misleading, and not surprizingly, it's the facts which are left out that are most glaringly obvious... This is just another radical and paranoid account of this subject matter. A great read if you want insight into the psychology of the fearful and delusional."
4,"Ex-student of one of the authors, currently in the US","I took this course on graduate quantum mechanics under one of the authors in the University of Madrid. I am currently completing a PhD project in which quantum mechanics plays a central role. This is a highly recommended book for advanced students, given the rigour of the treatment and the in-depth comments. The reader has to keep in mind that students taking this course have already completed a strong one year-period in quantum physics. You can search for either an english or a spanish edition. Specially apt for mathematically inclined readers."
2,Vague and outdated,This book is vague and outdated. It is painful trying to get useful information from it. It seems as though the authors had only a cursory understanding of the subject matter.
4,"A ""must read"" if you have a grandmother!","As I've gotten older, I've come to realize the important role my grandmother had in who I am today. I was lucky enough to be able to tell my grandmother, the ""Kinkeeper"" how important she was to me before she died. Hope's book can teach all of us that has a grandmother not to overlook this special bond. You'll want to call your grandmother after reading Hope's book. If I could recommend another great grandmother book, it would be ""Something to Remember Me By"" by Susan V. Bosak. I sent it to my grandmother as a way to tell her how important she was to me, and it meant so much to her! Horray for grandmothers!"
2,"Sounded cool and unusual, but turned out not so good.",I love little Jodie Foster - and this is her best era - but this wasn't the best flick in the world. Could have been so creepy and weird but just turned out a little insipid and stupid.
1,Video Didnt play,It read an error message when I tried to play it. It wouldnt play in my computer either. I was very disappointed!
3,"""Do you like Gorden?""","This little gem for the late 70's stars Jodie Foster, in a film that has a ""televison feel"" but it has garnished somewhat of a cult status over the years. First of all, Foster's superb acting ability is apparent here, and she is the driving force behind the suspense. However, this review is written in homage to Gorden. Now who, might you ask, is Gorden? He's not listed in the credits, but the scene between Martin Sheen and Gorden is so twisted, it makes you flinch. If you haven't seen the film, I won't spoil it for you in this review. But I'm sure if this film was made today, activists would assemble to protect the rights of all the Gordens in the world. Interesting point: Jodie Foster never acted with anyone quite like Gorden after this film was made."
4,Little Girl who lives down the Lane,"Early film staring Jodie Foster with an unusual story line - first rate with a couple of nice twists and a brooding sinister plot, that develops nicely.LG"
1,Beware - Don't Buy,"Item arrived - No packing material, no spatula. Returning immediately. Wok is extremely ""wide"" but has almost no depth. Afraid any small portion of food would immediately fly out of the wok due to no ""height"" on the sides. Can't even see it as sized for a 1-person meal. Not like photo's I've seen of item."
4,must have a regular DESK phone!!,"ok, so I am new to wireless headsets. Nobody told me that you need a 'real' desk phone in order for this unit to work properly. I had an AT&T trimline phone. It took 2 calls to tech support to find out that none of the headsets work with Trimline phones. Would be nice if the instructions mentioned this. Other that that, I have been very happy with the product. I am having a little difficulty lowering the volume as well."
3,Full headset,Sound is good coming to user. But clarity on the other end is a horrible mic has to almost be in your mouth for them to hear you!
2,"Great quality, not completely wireless","I had this product for a very short amount of time, in the interest of fairness I will say the sound quality was great and loved the comfort of the set. This was a purchase for a new home office. Loved the features listed to pick up calls remotely, adjust volume and great distance from the base. My only complaint and reason for returning it, is that the unit by itself is not completely wireless. After I received it I learned I had to have a headset lifter device to get it to answer using the headset, when I heard ""simply purchase the add on and tape it to the phone"" I decided this product was not the one for me. If you have a commercial land line this would be a great product. If looking to add on to a standard personal phone (home office), be prepared to tape the lifter to your phone."
2,Pantrontics Wireless Headset,"Wireless is wireless - the product review state good receiption I beleive up to 300 ft. This headset when in a range that it likes works well, but as soon as you are about 100 ft away the receiption gets poor continuously cutting out so you miss half the conversation. If you plans are to use this product in the same room as the base set - it's good, but not recommended for someone wanting to travel around the house or offices."
3,Does not function at advertised range,"This phone works well around the house, but the advertised range is 300 feet and it doesn't even work in the front yard. I did not purchase the automatic phone lifter, so operation is a little cumbersome. With the addition of the lifter it would be better, but that then pushes the price well above $250. A bit pricy for the quality."
1,Did not work and slow response for refund,"Tried to set up with Cisco SPA525G2 phone, but it did not work at all (the phone did work with another model of Plantronics headset.) After 12 days of confirmed returning of the device, still have not received any indication for refund."
4,Home Office User,"I use this headset and really like it. It does not have the range that I would like (can't run down to the kitchen to get tea while on conference calls), but I can move around quite a bit and have even taken conference calls on my deck!It is a little heavy and the headset doesn't adjust to different sizes well, but overall I like it."
2,it breaks after one year for sure,"this is a one year product, i bought over 8 of them, after one year, they just stop working for many reasons, contacted plantronic, they asked to ship it back for low price replacement, after i sent it back, they asked me to pay $180 for a new one, really! so i end up not buying it they kept my broken one, sounds like a deal (for them)"
4,"nice recording, but where's the slide?","I've listened to Kelly Joe Phelps since his first recording- actually own them all but for his ep- I was initially surprised when he avoided playing slide on ""Sky Like a Broken Clock"", then confused when he had Steve Dawson playing slide on ""Slingshot Professionals""- I was hopeful when I heard he was doing a live solo recording, and when I first saw the cd cover on his site, with his guitar laying flat, I'm afraid I had assumed (my fault) that he had returned to his amazing original style of slide playing- Unless my ears deceive me, there's nary a slide heard on this- please correct me if I'm wrong- I've never had the pleasure to see Phelps play live, hope to at some point..."
4,no slide,"I bought this cd to learn the potential of slide guitar, figuring that a live album would best capture it. So you can understand my disappointment when I patiently listened to the first song, assuming that he'd pick up his slide later. But he doesn't.I'm unfairly writing this after listening to two songs on the album, and I'm sure it'll still be worth the purchase, but make no mistake...Kelly doesn't play slide on this recording."
1,Junk,"Ok,it was <$15 but come on. It's basically a flat tarp with magnets on the corner. Magnets??? How about a taper for the pool table corners? Maybe buy it for as a liner for your cat box but this thing makes no sense to me as a pool table cover. Not worth my time to return--- garbage can liner."
4,On the mark,"David Patneaude has a bead on the push-and-pull of middle-school society. His main character is realistically torn between the flattery of a popular bully and the cameraderie of new friends who are way outside the in crowd. That alone will cause young readers to buy into this story. Patneaude adds suspense, some memorable characters, and drama, along with a satisfying conclusion. Young readers will almost certainly forgive the preachy and over-long finale wherein the bullies get their due. If you like this book, though, don't bypass this author's earlier novels Someone Was Watching and Last Man's Reward."
2,Not worth the money,"This is the first time I have ever written a review on amazon, but I felt this time I had to. I do like the red lamp shade and the design of the lamp, but this is cheap quality and not worth the money I paid for it. This lamp should not be priced over $50 and honestly the only reason I will not be sending it back because I cut up the box to open it and it's more of a hassle to send it back. I wanted it for my living room, but I have ended up putting it in my spare bedroom."
1,wrong color,"I loved the lamps but the color of the lamp shade was cherry red, not like the color I thought it was in the picture ,I thought it was more of a saddle color. sorry"
3,THIS IS NOT A 1972 MOVIE!!!!,"Have not seen this film yet,it may turn out to be a great movie,but I was expecting a 1972 film because, you know, it says atthe top 1972!!!! Yes, I know it says REBORN,but there are several unrealeased SCORPION titles out there, and I thought maybethis was one."
5,hard hitter,"this movie was crazy good. if your in to chessy slow-mo fighting with mouth fulls of blood splater. i never laughed so hard and the way she killed the guy at the end was the most gruesome execution id ever seen. this is now one of my favorite movies ever next to ""itchy the killer""."
3,Made for Drive-ins,"Aside from the all the violence and some sex stuff, this movie is somewhat dull. At least there is a decent amount of special features. First under 'Mayhem' is all the audio options including English/Swedish Audio and English Subtitles. Under 'Revenge', you get 'Trailers' which includes a TV Spot(28sec), Theatrical Trailer(1:29), Hooker's Revenge/Photographer's Model double preview(2:51), and a Thriller Trailer(1:21).Next is 'Alternate Footage' where you get an Outtake Reel(1:07), Alternate Harbor Fight(5:19), and Movie in Pictures(40sec). Also you get 'Still Galaries' which includes: In Bed with Christina(20 photos), Behind the Scenes(34 photos), Advertising Promotion(22 photos), Deleted Fight Scene(26 photos), and Production Photos(29 photos). Lastly you get Filmographies of Vibernius and Linberg."
4,Wow,"This is a mesmerizing flick. The violence is over the top, but integral to the plot.It is a rare dubbed film that I can watch at all. This one is so well-done that the language issue is not even noticable.If you're a fan of Tarentino, check this one out. See where he got some of his best ideas."
3,"THEE INFAMOUS ""THEY CALL HER ONE EYE""","i wont bore you with details of the excellent dvd content,for those wont matter much if you are not a fan of the film.this ""golden oldie"" exploitation movie should be filed under the RAPE/REVENGE genre,so know what you are getting into before delving into this nasty,nasty film.one should be warned that their are hardcore sex scenes (including anal!)interspersed with the other violent imagery.if you are a fan of the genre,add another star - for the uninitiated,be in for a slowly paced,quite tastless movie experience."
3,"Exploitation sure, but it delivers!","I just got done watching my limited release of the film thriller on dvd. Its a rather polished dvd and has some nice stuff on it.On to the movie. Its on par with ""I spit on your grave"". It doesnt make sense at times and is corny but it has some nice gore and even though i was prepared for the ""hardcore action"" it still shocked me when i saw it so for that i applaud it. This movie isnt comperable to anything recent but you can see that this movie started allot of movie making trends and for that it needs to be respected. Its possibly the best exploitation movie i have ever seen but in the end it is just that so i can only give it three stars. Had they tied up some of the loose ends it could have been a great flick but as it stands you need to take it for what it is."
2,Not Impressed,I have bought a bunch of these so called banned movies...Just finished this one....Maybe it is a cult classic...I just don't see where all the hype is.....The best revenge movie ever???...I guess back then it would have been....maybe I'm just desensitized....was not shocked at all.....Christina is hot though.....
1,"Bad, bad and bad.",Horribly made piece of trash. The porn shots had no business there and the movie would have been 15 minutes long without the ludicrous slow motion footage and excruciatingly long profile shots of the stars expressionless face.People who declared it a real movie because of a percieved meaningful social message need to get out more. Bugs Bunny cartoons were more realistic and showed more talent.
2,Thriller...,"Myself, I found it a ""different"" foreign film. It actually had a plot. She was treated cruelly, to be sure. The events in Frigga's life turned her into one cold, hard, calculating individual, whose revenge was total, and all-encompassing. That being said, there are some that may enjoy this ""blast-from-the-past,"" but, had I known what I was getting for my money, I would had kept my cash in my pocket. 2 stars."
4,Sweet and Hot revenge!,"This 70s classic is a definate cult fave. Christina is hot! The movement into the hardcore was an unexpected ""thrill""!"
4,Why don't they make movies like this anymore?,"Thriller - A Cruel Picture, is awesome, i believe this is where Quentin Tarentino got the most inspiration for Kill Bill 1 & 2, Christina Lindburg is amazing in this movie, the only thing i didn't care for was the violence, it was way too slow and bloodless, maybe some like it that way, but i prefer it to be fast and gory as hell, but the story is one of the best Rape/Revenge stories i have seen, and this film wasn't afraid to include every detail of sadism that was meant to be known about this story, It's a very artistic film in a curious type of way, and the film itself looks great, i would recommend the X-Rated version of this movie for the full appeal, but all in all its a great film, one of my new found favorites!"
