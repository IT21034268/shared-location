5,this is a great book!,I think this book is a top notch one and everyone wanting to know more on turtles should read if not buy this book!
5,best turtle book I've read to date,"I grew up raising turtles the easy way... in a tub or patio pond. Now I'm in a citified house with four legged critters who'd love to get their tongues around one of our turtle friends (""But Mom, I just wanna lick him a little...""). Ms. Palika's book has proven to be an extremely helpful guide in setting up our large in-the-house aquarium. My previous experience with turtle books was along the lines of the 50-page ""Turtles As Pets"" books, so this one was a pleasant departure from the norm. She sounds so knowledgeable, I just wish she lived in my area... it's rare to find people who are serious about turtle-keeping."
3,good book for children and absolute beginners,"There's plenty of correct information here, written in an easily readable chatty style, but it is not likely to be useful to anyone with any experience with chelonians. The lack of color pictures limits its usefulness in identifying species. This book should be recommended just for beginners."
4,I don't believe in God. Now what?,"While I value the work of the current crop of high profile atheist writers, I think Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens only bring their audiences to a certain point, and it is at that point many individuals ask themselves, ""Okay, I don't believe in God, now what?"" I'm glad to see there are authors out there (Eric Maisel is another -The Atheist's Way: Living Well Without Gods) who are filling a need in the atheist/agnostic community, beyond what the popular polemics offer."
4,read before Dawkins,"gives hope to us atheists and agnostics. shows that, unlike dawkins, we are not all angry and intolerant"
5,Sounds interesting!,This book sounds like it contains the sort of advice the Fellowship of Reason (URL) offers. I'm ordering a copy of this book today to further enrich my understanding of how to live a meaningful non-theistic life.
5,True Music,"The album may take a couple of listenings before one realizes how good it truly sounds. After hearing all three, this is definately my favorite. A must for anyone still out there that enjoys southern rock-"
5,So delicious!,"This oatmeal has more flavor than any other oatmeal I've ever tried. It has a wonderful natural sweetness and a slightly chewy texture. It is full of fiber and really needs nothing added to enjoy it's simple ""deliciousness""!I highly recommend this product as well as Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain cereal. Outstanding products."
5,Delicious,"My husband loves oatcakes, but we cannot purchase them easily in the US, so I make them for him. Of all the oatmeals out there, this is the very best - the only one - that makes oatcakes that have authentic taste and texture. It's a wonderful product. Thank you, Bob's Red Mill."
5,Scottish Oatmeal,"We eat hot cereal for breakfast 5 of 7 days. Use Irish Oats on the regular bases. This is really nice change: creamier like farina. Just make sure when you cook, do not add all cereal into water, pour in gradually and mix with a whisk. Otherwise, you will end up with lumps.I need to subscribe for regular delivery, as this way is a bit more cost effective."
5,Perfect,"These are a perfect compromise between the improved nutrition and texture of steel cut oats and the quick-cooking convenience of instant oats (you can microwave them in a few minutes, unlike steel cut oats). Bob's Red Mill products are always delicious and high-quality. Love these!"
2,"Good, but not great.","Let me start off by saying, I am slightly biased because I have been eatingMcCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, 28-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)for almost a year now. I am used to a chewy and nutty type of oatmeal. I ordered this oatmeal based on the great reviews here on Amazon. I cook all my oatmeal in myZojirushi NS-TGC10 Micom 5-1/2-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer, Stainless Steel. It takes all of the guesswork out of the cooking process, just dump in the ingredients and put in in porridge mode and wait. Anyhow, I was really not turned on by the texture of this product. It has very mushy texture to it. I gave the remaining three bags to coworkers. If I were you, I would go with the McAnns oatmeal if you like to have more nutty/ chewy texture."
5,New and interesting oatmeal,"I've eaten oatmeal more than 60 years but this is my first experience with this kind of cut. I find it tasty, but in all things that are a matter of taste, you may not find it so. So far, I've prepared it as I did the Quaker oatmeal: add salt, pour boiling water over it, add olive oil and sunflower kernels, and let it sit a couple of minutes. Although directions say cook for 10 minutes, it would seem to me that would produce pudding rather than oatmeal. It's quite filling and keeps me full until the next meal. BTW, you may wish to avoid eating this before bed the first time you try it, especially if you sleep with someone."
5,my new oatmeal,"I was a regular consumer of Quaker oatmeal, before tryingBob's Red Mill Organic Scottish Oatmeal, 20-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4). Although it requires plenty of stirring while cooking to avoid clumping, it has a very soft texture and pleasant, natural taste. I recommend usingHoneyTree's Organic Rainforest Honey, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6), organic raisins, and walnuts or almonds with this product."
2,Clumpy and Grainy,"I do *not* like this product. When microwaved, it tastes grainy. When cooked on the stovetop, it clumps up. McCann's steelcut (for stovetop) and Trader Joe's steelcut (for microwaving) are waaaaaayyyy better. Strangely, I really do like the Bob's Red Mill Oat Bran -- that cooks up good."
1,there are far better ways to learn Access and VBA,"This book was a textbook for an MIS class I took in college. There are far better ways to learn Access and VBA than by using this book. It does an ok job of showing you the basics, but it lacks technical explanations and doesn't help the student draw conclusions or make connections to other application development concepts. Instructors should stay away from this book unless they can fill in the gaps left by the authors!"
1,I Agree With The Others - Terrible Book - Big Disappointment,"I was shocked at the horrendous content and arrangement of this book. Normally speaking, the New Perspectives and/or Course Technology books are very informative and flow in a manner by which most people can learn. It seems to me that the authors wrote down ""Access words"", threw them up in the air, stood back while those words affixed themselves to pages, and then called those pages a book. The saving grace for students is that many colleges are now teaching Access 2000. Too bad that I am forced to give this book as good a rating as one star, but there is no lower rating available."
1,Authors do not understand database systems themselves!,Neither author seems to understand database systems. I think both author's are professors who have never had a real job in their lifes.
2,"get it just if you want the song, no remix","The track with BG is standard, just like the original but with an added section featuring rap by BG."
1,Body Composition calculator very inaccurate.,"Just two weeks ago, I was hydrostatically weighed at the Universtiy of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in the Human Performance Laboratory. My body fat percentage was measured to be 6.7%. Just today, I used Ron Brown's Body Composition Calculator which estimated my body fat percentage at over 14%! I think I could definitely estimate a person's body composition much more accurately just by looking at them. This book is most likely quackery and a get-rich deal for Mr. Ron Brown."
1,Don't waste your money!,"There are so many better books out there on health and fitness, don't bother with this one. I just had my body fat done and the charts in the book are completely wrong. Also, 3/4 of the book is charts. The remaining 1/4 is just the most general fitness info you could find anywhere. probably on the back of a Special K box."
1,Useless,"As a personal trainer and aerobics instructor for 15 years, I was very upset by all the incorrect, non-scientific and misleading information. Obviously the authour has very limited knowledge of the subject matter. He has based his theories on personal experience and anecdotal evidence-not research. He does not site references nor does he offer any scientic support for his OPINION. Reader beware of any diet or exercise book that does not site references! Most of his recommendations are down right wrong...amount of calories, intensity of aerobic exercise, high very-very high reps for strength training(shows his lack of knowledge of exercise physiology)."
1,WAS HOPING FOR GREAT NEW STUFF,"WELL, ORIGINALLY I WAS REALLY, REALLY EXCITED TO FINALLY ORDER THE PHYSICAL BOOK INSTEAD OF DOING THE ONLINE BUSINESS, BUT I HAVE TO SAY I WAS SURPRISED HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS (USED OR NEW) PLUS, WHEN I RECEIVED IT, I WAS REALLY BUMMED AT HOW BIG IT WAS!! GEEZ, I WANTED A BOOK I COULD USE AS A BIBLE AND CARRY AROUND WITH ME. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WAY WAY TOO MUCH OF THE BOOK IS FILLED WITH TABLES. QUITE A RIP OFF. VERY DISAPPOINTED. TRYING TO FIND THE TIME TO CHECK IT OUT THOROUGHLY, MAY POSSIBLY REQUEST A REFUND IN NEAR FUTURE. NOT NEAR WHAT THE HYPE INDICATED.THANK YOU."
2,Bitter Cheese,"The product arrived with no freeze pack remaining. I let the product sit in a refrigerator over night to ""reset"". This sample (1 lb) was bitter.I had also ordered from another Wisconsin site and it was not bitter. I will not try again from this source."
5,Fun for All Ages,"My son is almost two. He absolutely loves when I read him this book...over and over again. He even tries to read it with me. The rhyming and repetition keep his attention. He turns each page with great anticipation. He really loves the illustrations and pointing to all the pictures. It's one of his favorites and it's fun for parents to read, too! I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone."
5,Loads of pleasure for your child,"My 16 month old loves this book. He would have us read it over and over again and never seems to tire of the story. The rhtyhm of the words and the simple and bold illustrations make this book an attention getter. As soon as I come home in the evening my son starts ""choo-choo"" and ""clikkity-clak"". He loves it."
4,dry but indispensible,"You know how there are those books that need to get written but you don't want to do it because of the tedious labor and research it would take...this is one of those books. Boime maps the pedagogical devlopment of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and then discusses the techniques, brushes, canvases, etc. used in the academy in the nineteenth century. The book is pretty dry, but the work that went into it makes it valuable to any scholar of modern French painting."
5,The Best Racing game ever!,"I love every Jet Moto game. I own all three of them! It's a game that pushes racing games to the limit with extreme stunts and radical wipeouts(which I mostly do but I still think the game is great)! I got this game for Christmas from my dad and I love winning the races when when I'm racing against him. Although Jet Moto 3 is easier then the first two, it's graphics out run them both. This is the best game I have in my collection and it will be for a long time so put it in your shopping cart to buy it!"
5,GREAT GROUP,GREAT GROUP LOVE THEIR MUSIC I CAN SING IT ALMOST EXACTLY THE WAY THEY DO IT SO IT IS GOOD
5,Great NKOTB DVD,"After watching this DVD, one would think that BSB, NYSYNC, and OTOWN should pay the New Kids some of their royalties for cloning the NKOTB act over and over. This DVD captures some excellect live performances of the boys at their peak and all the video singles. The kids ruled the music charts from 88-90, and this DVD will make you nostaglic for when there was only one boyband, as opposed to the 6 ""clones' that are out there now. Trivia - Jordan Knight and Joe Mcintyre both rode the 1998/99 pop wave, and had comeback hits that year. Knight opened for NYSNC that summer."
1,Who edited this book?,"I'm not really sure if this book had a real editor, but the typos were ridiculous. Not to mention the run-on sentences and the critical punctuation issues.Plus, no author should preface their own book with their own quote--and a quote that uses the word known and unknown in every way 'known' to mankind.Not that this book doesn't have merit, or that this author doesn't have talent--it just isn't well utilized or presented in this particular form."
5,A must for a Padre or history buff.,Bob Chandler has TONS of stories of road trips and player interviews. Love his perspectives specially if you love the Pads.
1,Fiction,"Heinrich ""Gestapo"" Müller dissappeared in May 1945. The theory that he defected to the CIA is just one theory. As there is no hard evidence that Müller had a connection with the CIA or that he even survived the war it makes me wonder the authencity of the diaries. It is very easy to write the ideas/thoughts of a dead man. So when you want to buy these 3 volume books think twice."
2,Not the best introductory book,"This book was a required text for the Unix course I am enrolled in and I found it to be a very difficult book to learn Unix. The author attempts to explain shell scripting, for example, by providing the script and then explaining what the script does in paragraph form. This made the chapters on bourne, c and korn shell very difficult to learn from. Try Ellie Quigley's book ""Unix Shells by Example"" for learning shell scripting. Quigley provides plenty of examples to learn from and provides step by step explanations on shell scripting.Sobell does a good job Chapter 7, networking. Most of this chapter is explaining concepts and not teaching and explaining Unix commands.I would not recommend this book if you are learning Unix. I think there are books out there do that do a better job to those new to Unix.Given a choice, I preferred the following:""Learning the Unix OS"" by Oreilly. ""Unix Shells by Example"" by Quigley, which I highly recommend"
5,Great for getting to know Unix's interesting ins and outs,"Mark Sobell manages to introduce a whole host of those great Unix utilities with non-descriptive names AND keep it readable. He will put you on the right track to being able to find your own way around Unix. I've read it, in fact, I took it on holiday with me, and strongly recommend it to those starting out in the Unix world, or those that have become a little rusty. It's perhaps a bit too technical for absolute beginners, but avid DOS users should not experience too much trouble getting to grips with the everyday Unix commands. The book has a clear layout too: Try it!!!"
4,Unix textbook,"An excellent textbook. Clear explanations and then many real world examples. It was recommended by a friend and I, too, recommend it"
4,Sicilian Vespers,"I put off watching this DVD for quite sometime. When I did finally view it, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The singing was wonderful, the recording was good, and the setting was effective. The 'Sicilian Vespers' took place in the 13th century, but the costumes here are updated to the 19th - that is Verdi's own time. The opera is longer than usual for Verdi, but it goes by quickly. About twenty minutes of the 3d act is devoted to a ballet that could stand on its own as a performance piece. I'm astounded that this opera is a 'neglected' work. I deducted a star since the DVD has few extras or choices."
4,for Verdi lovers,"This is one of Verdi's most neglected operas, and we are fortunate to have at least this video version since you'll probably never get a chance to see it live. If you love Verdi, this DVD is well worth the price. Cheryl Studer is outstanding as usual."
3,Verdi's Rightfully Neglected Piece,"While I was familiar with the music of this opera, I was quite happy to get it on DVD, since it is very rarely performed. After seeing it, I understood why. It is definitely more enjoyable on the car CD player, than as an actual visual performance.While the opera is certainly one of Verdi's lesser successes, the ridiculous production, with Napoleonic outfits was very annoying ( the actual story takes place in the XIIIth. Century), and anyone familiar with the original story, or at least following the subtitles would catch on to this. While the singers were good, the bad production weighted them down.The ballet was clearly a tedious and unpleasant afterthought for Verdi, as its score is totally lacking his usual flair and the lacklustre choreography did not help a bit to lift the tedium."
5,Best All-Around SAT Book--I had all my SAT Students Read it,When I began teaching SAT courses I couldn't answer all the multiple choices for the reading or math questions myself so I read 13 books on the SAT to see if I could understand why the right answers were right so I could help my students (and keep from being embarrassed from not being able to answer their questions). After reading his book and doing the exercises I finally understood the basic principles and I was able to teach them to my students. I understood how the math questions were constructed and the best strategies for maximizing a student's score. I understood how the Critical Reading questions were set up and I taught this to my students and the results were amazing! This is definitely the best book on the SAT.
5,success story,"I took the SAT in May having had no SAT prep or practice, besides the PSATs, and recieved a 2190/2400 and a 9/12 on the essay. I was satisfied, but felt that I could have done much better on the essay.So, I signed up for the June SATs and went and bought Adam Robinsons ""The Rocket Review Revolution: The Ultimate Guide to the New SAT."" I practiced the essays, and even had one personally scored by Adam via e-mail. I also spent 1-2 hours a week for the four weeks of May studying for the other sections through the book.On the June test I got a 2290/2400, and a perfect 12/12 on the essay! My math score went up 90 points and my critical reading score went up 110 points for a total increase of 200 points!I highly reccommend this book, it is very helpful and comprehensive, and the team behind it is easy to contact with questions via email, and responds promptly. Plus, it gives results!"
5,this book is the best,"This book is by far the best test prep book for the SAT. No one else gives you the tricks and strategies that Adam gives. This book raised my score by over 300 points to over a 2300. You have to buy this book. Seriously. Don't listen to the crazy lady who gave this book one star. Together with the College Board's 10 Real SATs, you'll be set."
5,"SAT Prep, best yet for students with a brain","Rocket Review works well for any high school student with the ability to think. Any student who spends the time to go through Adam's brilliant work will clearly improve his chances to score higher on the New SAT. I was able to locate a weakness of mine with the 'counting' problems which I had not detected using other prep courses.Adam makes you think when other course books put you to sleep. It's a real wake up call for anyone interested in improving.C Sinn, Malta"
5,Great book,"Ok lol, the time we are suppose to spent on studying the book and the cd rom is 1-2 month. For me, i started to study on friday, the day right before the test. I didn't get really far, even though the book is in big large print, but it has some really useful information. They gave a lot of example about the type of sentence error, explaining throughly. They have suggested vocab word to use in ur essay instead of the plain easy word. half of the book focused on the math section tho, which i didn't look over. I didn't even have time to write an essay and let them grade it online. But anyway, very very good book. Im pretty sure it will improve ur score by a lot, like 200,... if u read it throughly. ONE MORE THING, the book is made before the first NEW SAT was even out, the ysaid it's the closest to the actual SAT"
5,Soul of the Organs,"Both musicians on this album were great. I am more aquainted with Luis Rivera's music because he was a personal friend. Luis Rivera and his trio appeared frequently in Los Angeles in various night clubs where Isaw him preform in the sixties. He usually had a full house where ever he preformed. This album is one of the few that are left of Jazz Organ music. I encourage the purchase of this album to those who appreciateJazz Organ, especially by gifted and soulful musician's. It is a must for one's Jazz library.Naomi Clark"
5,Mayra Calvani -- TCM REVIEWS,"""On the holiest of night long, long ago, the animals in the stable were restless..."" Thus begins this engaging Christmas picture book that will capture the imagination of young children.The Littlest Christmas Kitten tells the story of a mother cat who is frantically searching for her little kitten in a very special stable... the stable where Baby Jesus is born. But where could the kitten be possibly hiding?The illustrations, with their earthly colors, are interesting and original and capture the setting and the `essence' of the story well. The language evokes a warm feeling of serenity and peaceful beauty very appropriate for `the holiest of nights.' At the end there's an illustrated glossary of Christmas symbols related to the kitten's tale.This is a book that both teaches and delights, and that will make a lovely gift for a young child."
5,Absolutely lovely!,"This sturdy little book from Dover contains six wildflower stencils. They're precut and easy to remove, and clearly labeled. I used them on some cupboards I put together, and they look fabulous. My favorite is the virginia creeper, though the exotic jack-in-the-pulpit runs a close second. Also included are a lady's slipper orchid, a black-eyed susan, a swamp rose mallow, and a stand of bluebells. One of the best books in this series."
3,peanut book,"small book, can finish reading it in 5 minutes, even though it is over 100+ pages.Since I paid 1 cent for the book, I can't complain.S/H was a fixed $3.99"
1,Worst Quality,"The contents are OK, although not great. The paper used for this book and theprinting quality is the worst quality I have ever seen in my life.You even don't want to use this kind of paper in the restroom.It's a shame that our beloved Peanuts characters had to printed in there. It's a crime.The publishers should be sued for Peanut characters molestation.I'm an avid Peanuts fan and I'm greatly disappointed. I somehow expectedthe similar quality of the Series: Friendship is .."", ""Love is .."", ""Happiness is ...""""Hope is ..."""
4,"Good, but a little pricey","Title pretty much says it. I thought it was a little pricey for what we got (would have preferred paperback for lower price), but I did enjoy reading it. I recommend it. ach set of two facing pages has a quote and a one-scene cartoon. Forward is by Bill Cosby. Groupings of quotes are Life Philosophy, Confidence, Self Care, Self Reliance, People Shills, Prudence, Wisdom, Effort, Love and Little Quirks."
3,Erotic but light on plot.,"I enjoyed the anthology. All three stories are very sexy and filled with erotic scenes, but maybe too much for their own good.Each story was heavy on sex and light on plot. I know they're short stories, but any sort of story arc was a shallow afterthought. Conflict is in sadly short supply. (The second story with the lion didn't seem to have any.) There should have been some plot to go with that sex, preferably sex more relative to plot. After a while I started skimming sex scenes to see if anything more interesting would happen.Maybe I was expecting too much, or maybe it's intended to have more sex than plot (since all three seem to follow that formula).I would recommend it as an interesting read if you don't take it too seriously."
4,Better than expected,"I originally bought this anthology for Kate Douglas' Chanku Fallen, which is Mik, AJ & Tala's story. We were kind of left in the dark about them in the Wolf Tales series.Fantasie was a bit strange, since I'm not overly fond of time travel, but interesting enought to finish reading it.Call of the Wild was a great hit with me. As a shapeshifter fan, it just made me anxious to seek out more of the authors works.Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable read. Maybe not a candidate for the keeper shelf, but worth reading."
1,Seriously?,This is an account by a jealous wannabe. Ms. Gallagher tries to cloak her envy and dislike of Jackie but it shines through as it would through any amateur author. Give it a rest Mary. You're done.
1,Great Fantasy Novel...,"Karen Armstrong writes an incredibly accurate portrayal of the life of the Prophet accept without 75% of his life. Muhammad had a life where the entire last half was dripping with blood. Armstrong does a great job of referencing the great, peaceful philosophies of Muhammad while grazing over the slaughter of the Jews of Banu Qurayze for not converting. Islam has the belief of abrogation, which is that it is alright for the Qur'an to contradict itself because the later revelation overwrites the earlier one. The call for Jihad at the end of Muhammad's life is then the law that is to be followed. Muhammad was not a man of peace by any means. Extremely intelligent, and a phenominal leader, but far from peaceful. For a dry but immensely more accurate picture of Muhammad's life, readThe Life of Muhammad. This is the oldest account of the life of the Prophet that is still in existance and many historians claim as the most accurate."
2,Sip! Don't Swallow!,"If what you are looking for is a relatively easy-to-read biography of Muhammad, if you do not want it to be from the perspective either of a believer or an attacker of Islam, and if you don't mind winnowing the factual information and forming your own opinions instead of swallowing the author's, this is not a bad book.What makes it tedious is the author's endlessly intrusive agenda. She is an apostate nun with lots of big bones to pick with Christianity. Unfortunately, Christianity is not her chosen topic, and it is a major distraction to have her continually turn aside to land a few outraged whacks. Decide for yourself whether she applies the same standards of behavior to her chosen subject.Factually acceptable, but please spare me the polemics!"
5,Every Westerner Should Read This,"This is more than a biography. This book really provides a lot of insight about Islam. People in the west have a great deal of ignorance about Islam and this book is the place to start if you want to learn more. As an American, I found that this book provided me with an educated opinion about Islam, something lacking in the western world."
5,Critical analysis,I have read several reviews about Karen Armstrong book many have liked it and others have called her naive . I guess it is how we view her writting skill. First point is that she is not a muslim to have any kind of biasing.I have found her impartial.she has presented query from western perspective as well as islamic perspective. She has presented her work in such a way that it brings out prejudism and threaten their own preassumtions regarding Mohammed and Islam. I have found her work very analytic not lacking any sophistication.This book can bring out prejudism and preconcieved ideas that people have developed over the ages living in western world viewing islam through that lense.It is how we view a glass half full or half empty. We are looking at same book and presenting different views as we see it.
4,symphatetic biography,"Armstrong's book has a definite direction.It provides insight into much of the 'humaness' of the prophet of islam and the realities of the socio political climate of the time. Her sympathetic biography is particularly useful in potraying a constructive and positive profile to those less familiar with the prophet and Islam. On a personal level, for me as a muslim, I loved the sense of identification and inspiration that the book provides - it often allowed for the message of the prophet to be understood in real terms not estranged from our own times, as overzealous reverence for the prophet often makes one miss this.The book is however specific in its potrayal as is the value derived thereof and is by no means intended to be authoritive."
1,Reprehensible,"I can hardly call the viewpoint of this book ""neutral."" Ms. Armstrong wrote this biography of the Prophet in the wake of the Salman Rushdie/Satanic Verses affair to inspire admiration of the Prophet and tolerance of Islam on the part of westerners.Ms. Armstrong covers distasteful aspects of Mohammed's career such as approving the murder of a Jewish poet and critic and condoning the massacre of the Jewish tribe of Bani Qarayza, but tries to justify them as being part of the time and place. She does not reflect on how Mohammad conveniently received revelations to wiggle out of some dilemma involving his relations with his wives (which makes one wonder about the source of those revelations) and on why these revelations should be considered the Final Revelation of God. To me, that's insulting."
4,Fair minded Catholic writes biography of Muhammad,"Despite the ""reprehensible"" reviewer from somewhere in the US one can clearly see a non Muslim but sincere author treating a life in its time and place with some fairness. An excellent biography for the westerner or other ""people of the book"" (Chrisian or Jew) to start with. A little historical context here goes further than pseudo social science or psychology, and certainly much further than the ravings of the enemies of understanding in their own ""glass houses"". I used to teach Iskamic History at Christian Colleges (Moravian and Muhlenberg) and wish I had books like this at the time."
1,Why?,"It amazes me that a serious student of history would go to a book such as this to learn anything.The life story of Mohammed, the last and final prophet, (salallaahu aleihe wasallam) is based like any reliable history upon the chain of transmission of information and upon the characters of the transmitters themselves.Ibn Ishaq wrote SIRAT RASUL ALLAH and Ibn Kathir wrote AL- SIRA AL- NABAWIYYA both authoratative texts on the subject full of exhaustive detail, complete with sahih hadith (absolutely confirmed reports).Karen Armstrong's work seems derisory in comparison."
3,Different editions,"ISBN:0575050128 is the 1991 ""Victor Gollancz Ltd."" (London, UK printing) paperback edition titled ""Muhammad: A Western Attempt to Understand Islam"" by Karen Anderson, 290 pages with notes and index. It is a reprint (but retitled) of ISBN:0062500147 (hardback)titled ""Muhammad: a biography of the prophet"", or ISBN: 0062508865 which is the 1993 ""HarperSanFrancisco"" (HarperCollins Publishers)paperback edition -- but with a new Preface, of the same later title."
1,"religion, a garbage of human mind.","what can i say about karen armstrong, who is stubborn to defend a man, who did his best to demean and degrade women and killed, torutured, slaughtered and massacred innocent pagans,( sirat rasul allah, by ibn ishaq, written 1300 years ago, its translation has recently been printed in pakistan)?muhammad did exactly what moses and joshua did in their time. These two delusionals also killed, tortured, slaughtered, massacred innocnet pagans in judea, samaria and canaan in the name of their god, yahweh.i can only wish that karnen was one of the squas of muhammad's harem."
1,Why?,"It amazes me that a serious student of history would go to a book such as this to learn anything.The life story of Mohammed, the last and final prophet, (salallaahu aleihe wasallam) is based like any reliable history upon the chain of transmission of information and upon the characters of the transmitters themselves.Ibn Ishaq wrote SIRAT RASUL ALLAH and Ibn Kathir wrote AL- SIRA AL- NABAWIYYA. Both are widely regarded as authoratative texts on the subject; full of exhaustive detail and complete with sahih hadith (absolutely confirmed reports).Karen Armstrong's work seems derisory in comparison."
2,"Biased, biased...","Sadly, I found it difficult to like this book as her blatent lack of objectivity concerning both Islam and Christianity brought into question many of the most interesting and meaningful aspects. Having researched Muhammad to a small extent, I found that many of her ""facts"" are based on tentative evidence and unverified accounts. If you're looking for an objective and true account of Muhammad, look elseware."
3,"Well-researched, but biased","Ms. Armstrong trys too hard to explain away everything Muhammad is alleged to have done. From the villianization of Jewish tribes (Muhammad just had to slaughter them because they were devious), to women wearing veils (Muhammad had to prevent embarassment and possible scandal from the constant wave of visitors). I only wish she were as kind and forgiving toward orthodox Christianity as she is of Islam. Overall a well-researched and written book."
2,Not a serious read.,"I'm going to be very unfair to Ms. Armstrong by comparing her book to Mark Durie's ""The Third Choice"", and I'm going to base my review solely on citations.Mr. Durie's book is full of valuable resources, some of them are first source, whereas this book is so lacking it made me wonder if this auther was writing fiction or non-fiction.Mr. Durie is not only a clergyman but he's a scholar as well? I mean come on, Karen! Keep Up!!!"
3,"good, but a little confused","An enjoyable read but Armstrong contradicts and fails to draw distinctions. For instance, she uses Secular West and Christianity interchangeably, as if they are the same entity(I personally enjoyed her scathing remarks about the latter). She also goes way out of her way to be an apologist, instead maintaining the necessary objective distance. But all in all, I feel better informed."
5,Classic early honky-tonk!,"Early 'Fifties recordings, made before Webb signed to Decca Records. This disc is instantly recognizable from its garish green cover. But even with the echo-y fake stereo remastering, this is killer material. A little rawer and rowdier than his major label work, and hella fun. Anyone who felt burned by the thin, echo-y sound quality of the old LP versions will be heartened to hear that the mix on this CD copy is much better, and closer to the original mono mixes. Recommended!"
4,Viva! What a workout!,"This tape actually does what it promised to do! It contains a fantastic workout programme with easy to follow (and very very sexy) dance movements. The instructions are clear. The music and beat just keep ones feet moving (doing samba, cha-cha etc.) Certainly a great way to keep fit!"
3,Not so hot...,"All these raving reviews here stun me. Are we talking about the same tape? The English version ""Viva"" I have features Latin steps that Jane Fonda included in her old ""Complete Workout""! I was extremely disappointed in the music. Expected songs or at least some great Brazilian sounds, but this stuff is strictly muzak. As for the ""sexy"" movements, Elise has the shimmy and tummy rolling down pat; unfortunately, she doesn't teach these foxy movements to the rest of us. The gals in the background look as stiff and frankly lost as I felt while doing the routine. One funny thing, though: Elise starts the tape by yakking calmly--the usual drill--and then vrrrrrrooom! She's moving a mile a minute! You'll break a sweat fast, but so would you if you turned the radio to any Latin station and just stood there jiggling. That's what this video feels like to me. Sorry."
1,Don't buy this,"I love workout videos, but this was the worst! It looks like somebody filmed it with a camcorder. Don't waste your money."
3,getting started,"Perhaps I was the only one who didn't realize this -- but the all the exercise instructions are in Spanish. Also, if you don't know the basic steps to mambo, the cha cha cha and the samba--the first few times could be frustrating. The moves change too quickly into the exercise program to keep up. The music is good and there's a lot of hip-shaking...I hope to have more fun once I have the moves down. Because I don't know Spanish, its difficult to anticipate the moves which makes keeping up a bit harder than usual. People who do not have a dance background may find it a bit daunting in the beginning. I know I did."
2,Bad dancing,The music is bad and so is the dancing. I donated this to my public library so that people can try it for free before committing any funds to it. However it is better than no exercise at all.
4,Viva Dance!,"Lots of pep, lots of hip, a nice cardio for a beginner or intermediate level. Dance steps can be learned in one or two sessions.I recommend it to anyone who hates to exercise, but loves to dance."
1,very disappointed,"first, I didn't break a sweat, and I would consider myself an intermediate in the aerobic area. second, the music is not music. it's someone with a synthesizer hammering out a lame ""latin-esqe"" beat. I was looking good some fun and inspiring latin music and well this is NOT it. It is sooooo cheesy. This dvd *might* be good for the VERY early beginner or someone who's trying to learn english as a second language (the dvd is bilingual). Other than that, I can't see much use."
2,Viva! Latin Rhythm Workout,"The ""Latin"" moves in this workout seem strangely like American aerobics to me. You can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves, but if you're interested in Latin dance, my advice is to buy Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac instead. This workout just isn't as energetic and fast-paced as it looks."
4,Great low impact workout,"The exercise is low impact and the music is good. The dancing makes it more amusing than the regular mundane steps. No one is screaming like the Richard Simmons tapes. My only criticism is the lack breathing instructions when stretching since I forget when it is best to inhale vs. exhaling. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
2,nothin' doin',"I bought this tape based on the reviews here and I regret it. Elise seems like a great, perky mover, but this tape is boring. It has really bad, tinkly music, goofy background dancers (one of whom can't move her hips to save her life, and another of whom looks bored), and it doesn't get intense enough to give you a good hearty cardio workout. There's not much sexy or stylish about it. Elise is warm and enthusiastic and can move--but this is not a good workout tape."
2,Disappointed,"I read great reviews and got excited to have fun with latin beat and dance steps.Unfortunately, it is a basic aerobics workout to generic, uninspiring music.I wanted something different and this wasn't it. I bought four various DVDs or VHS together and this was the worst one.You will sweat, but it is not a dance cardio workout. Just your average aerobics class."
4,Hip Shaking Fun!!,"I got this from the library and loved it from the first time I did it, so I had to buy it! The moves are easy to follow and Elise has the cutest accent! Yes, it's true that the background dancers aren't that enthusiastic and one does look bored, but I don't focus on them. I focus on following the music, swaying my hips and working up a sweat! This is a great workout if you just want to dance!"
4,Fun Workout!,"I just tried Viva Latin Workout Video and loved it. I come from a dance background although an injury stopped the fun years ago. I found this video energetic while being safe. I worked up a sweat, had a great time and the workout was done before I knew it."
5,A Great and Fun Workout,"Elise Foss is entertaining with contagious enthusiasm. This tape will give you a fun workout. This is highly recommended for those who want to add a latin flair to their workout, work up a sweat...and learn a few Latin dance moves."
5,"Not To Sure Why A ""Christian Rapper"" CD shows ""[Explicit]""","This is a good CD but I like his old cd better, King Cyz ""Life Or Death"" that was released in 2001. I think amazon has there information wrong because this album is not ""[Explicit]"". Currently durning this album review Amazon has the CD title as *** Wake-Up [Explicit] *** and that is not correct. Unless talking about God and Jesus in music is now considered ""Explicit""... but I don't think so. Don't be fooled by Amazons error. Preview the CD for yourself, you'll see."
2,Disappointing,Assigned summer reading.. Heads up.. Holiday Surprises (ie Easter Bunny and Santa) are sorely tested. Many kids in my son's class were sad to read this part.
2,don't use with at&t uverse,This IR repeater does work with some electronic devices but not my at&t uverse receiver which is why I bought it. I guess it has something to do with the frequency range of the remote.
5,works great on Sony blu ray player and Comcast digital receiver,I heard alot of people say they had problems getting the correct repeater.. not me this one worked perfect the first time.
3,too bulky to carry around,"On the upside: good visual tool! It has enlightened me on the location of certain trigger points of the lower extremities.On the downside-I have to carry it around and that chart is just to bulky for travel. It would be just as good if it were an 8x11.I usually like visuals but this chart lacks condensed info on what you're looking at. The same directions on how to read the chart appear on each page over and over. I would have liked to see some clues and tips instead.All in all, had I known better, I would saved my money to put toward the books because the chart is rather expensive for just the drawings."
5,quick reference,This flip chart is very easy to use for a quick reference when time is a factor. I keep it where it can be accessed during the day for treatment in the out-patient therapy office.
2,This book is so small,This book is so small it is about the size of a paper clip in lenghth. The book it self is ok but not what I was expecting of it.
5,Buffy Rules!!(Spike's Hot),"I am a big fan of Buffy. I love all the characters you can be. You can be Evil, Oz, Buffy, Xander, + Willow."
5,A must for any hardcore BtVS Fan,"Great game! It takes a while to learn it and the instructions are hard a little hard to read, but it is better if you set up and play the game while you read the instructions. You can chose which ""big bad"" you want to be: The Master, The Judge, The Mayor or Adam. The good characters never change:Buffy, Willow, Xander, Oz(he does change into a wolf during the game) and you also have a chance of having Angel. The ""minions"" that can be played are Dru, Spike, Darla, Vamp X and you have a chance of calling in Veruka(she-wolf from season 4), Harmony, Angelus, Kathy(demon roommate from season 4). My only complaint is it doesn't have a wider selection for good characters-No Cordy, Giles, Tara or Anya. Game is varied enough that you won't tire of it quickly."
5,It's Really Fun,"I really enjoyed receiving the Buffy game for my birthday, even though it was intended as a joke. I read the rules without understanding, and almost gave up on the idea of ever playing, because I assumed it would be really stupid anyway. I was very surprised when I finally did get through the rules that the Buffy game was not only entertaining, it was a strategy game as well!! Now I play all the time, or a lot of the time anyway, and I never feel silly that I am playing a game designed for children. I am so glad I got this game, and I would recommend it highly for anyone who enjoys the show."
2,Great Setup! Need a College Degree to play,I bought this game in hopes to have fun with it although the game looks great and looks fun to play theres so much stuff to do remember and the instruction booklett is like a novel a very confusing one. I dont not reccomend you buy this product until some drastic changes are made nice idea but not yet ready>
5,A trip down memory lane - And a zip into the present with NH,All the MTV videos that I remember from the 80's. The clothes look hysterical now but the music is just as great as it always was. If you need a kick in the pants to get your day started -- watch Walk of Life. Some great additions to this video are three Notting Hillbillies songs and a Local Hero video I'd never seen before. It will round out your collection of the best story teller and guitarist of the last 20+ years.
5,"Their best collection of musicvideos, i't can't be better...","got very many good songs here, while ""money for nothing"", "" sultans of swing"", ""brothers in arms"" , ""walk of Life"", is their more known. the other songs are superb too. i really like this, and this is one of the things a true dire strait- fan would buy, like me...for example. they are best live too."
4,"Great music, not great technical quality of the tape","The Dire Straits video collection is just excellent, I recommend everyone to have it.However the technical quality of the tape is not real good. It is VHS Hi-Fi, sound is perfect, but video is not.Too bad it is not a DVD."
3,50's Camp Classic!,"This is a fun film. Don't try to electricute Lon Chaney Jr. It will only make him angry. Fun film, w/ lots of 1950's atmosphere. Great entertainment for fans of Chaney (and Sci Fi fans alike). Chaney's mad (insane) rampage throughout this film , is worth watching. Very entertaining and (somewhat) highly recommended."
5,Oh snap!,I suffered a severe bout of pulmonary edema in the middle of this book. I was carried down by Pumba and 2 other sherpas to the living room where I took some dexo and drank some soup. Almost died. Thats how good this book is.
4,Great quality for price,Great quality. I bought two rolls for the team and we used them for our practice mats. I would be these again.
5,Chamberlin 760CB Keylock / Eelectric Contatc Device,The product was as expected. All necessary hardware was included. Installation was without problem. it was a good buy and the only place I could find access to a product like it.
5,Tasty crisps!,"I buy these at a local grocery store, not from amazon.com.They are absolutely lovely. Light and crisp, they're like naked Cheetos, that are actually fairly healthy. They can be topped with most anything, sweet or savory. Great for midnight snacks, afternoon snacks, or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner. Wish they'd make them in flavors, they'd beat the pants off most ""diet"" snacks I've ever seen!"
2,Wow... So that is what edible Styrofoam tastes like...,"I have a tried a few of these Wasa crisp breads. This one was by far the worst. It was in essence entirely flavorless. It tasted to me the way that I expect that those little packing Styrofoam peanuts would taste.Don't get me wrong it didn't taste bad, hence the 2 stars, it just didn't taste like anything. Looking for a low-cal snack type cracker? Try the Wasa Sourdough Rye crackers. Now those are heavenly!"
4,Nice cracker for those eating low carb,We are trying to curb our carbohydrates. The Wasa Crisp'n Light is a big help. Especially when you need something crisp. We have and will continue to order this product. Thanks Amazon for selling this tasty cracker.
5,Healthy crunch and easy on the teeth,"These are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy, perfect with dips or salsa. Tastes just like rice cake. They are very easy on the teeth too, for those who have dental work that they don't want to chip. Hard to find in supermarkets."
5,Yum!,"I love the light texture and the taste kind of reminds me of chex cereal which is a good thing. It makes a great snack, I use Laughing Cow cheese wedges spread it on and lay down some spinach or radishes with smoked sardines or tuna. Delicious! Or instead of using a crostini to make bruschetta, I use these crackers. And if I'm too lazy to make stuff, I just snack on it by itself."
5,a standout product,"These crackers are very delicious, have a wonderful texture, adapt well to any spread, and they are only 20 calories each--great for people watching their calories. They are very satisfying, and they contain whole grains in a tasty form."
3,"Great Product, not ready for primetime","I own this game, and had a ton of fun using it at home. The problem with it lies when one is attempting to use the product while ATV'ing, or perhaps flying a helicopter.Two nights ago I was driving in the back of a semi truck and with all the bumps I kept on winning, or losing. Next thing I know I had on no pants and was driving a semi truck in the middle of the night.This game is not for the faint of heart."
4,"Great Idea, Poor Construction","Love the concept, just like Plinko from The Price Is Right, except you get to drink! Can't wait to play this with friends. The only downside is that it appears to be very poorly constructed as one of the peg broke and I barely touched it. For the price, I guess I can't except much more. Would love it is the Seller would replace it free of charge, but that is wishful thinking."
1,Fun Game!!! But arrived in pieces and beat up! So embarrassing!,"We have one of these and when our friends (who love drinking games) had a stock the bar (wedding shower) we had to get this game for them! We have played our own at several of our parties and it is always a big hit! I know they will love it!After receiving the game in the mail I wrapped it and gave it to our friends. We made them open it at the shower so we all could use it... But we weren't able to. Sadly the game was destroyed! There were about 15 to 20 pegs that were broken off the board so the chips don't slide. I wish I had opened it as soon as I got this game. Because now, I don't think that I can return it. My husband and I were so embarrassed, giving our friends a broken gift and making them open it so we all could use it.You have been warned!! Don't buy from here... You are better off finding it at a store in person!!!"
3,i guess it works...,"Well, I was expecting something a little more interesting... the ""coins"" don't tend to jump around as much as you would think... still, it's a fun novelty game."
1,sengoku OR-77 Kero heater,"I have owned 4 kero heaters for 25 years and never had a unit that smelled.. I ordered this one for a replacement. The unit smelled when i started it - so I contacted Amazon and they replaceed it for me. The second unit smelled when running. I contacted the factory and the customer rep said ""get aneedle nose pliers and pull up the wick"".? I did so and it still smelled. I purchased a new wick and replaced it and it still smelled. I contacted the factory via 3 emails and received no response. I guess i'm stuck with this stinker. I purchased a new kero world KW-11f today - great!"
3,heater review,Heater works all right but seems to put out a lot of odor went in use or when not turned on.
4,good when power goes out and to knock the chill out!,"At first this heater did smell. But after reading some articles I found out that the wick setting was set too low causing the odor. Now that the wick is set at the proper height it burns great and without a odor. Great heater for power outages and also to knock out the chill in the home. In order to get 12 hours of burn time,you must fill beyond the ""F"" into the ""red zone"" then you will get the full 12 hours of burning."
2,One Tank Lasts Nearly 16 Hours But...,A few months back when researching this heater in Amazon comments some said one tank doesn't last the advertised 12-14 hours so I decided to time it. With the wick adjusted at its lowest setting and the tank filled just shy of the rim one tank lasted 15 hours and 54 minutes! The fuel gauge isn't accurate as it reads empty or full when it's not and the flame continues burning approximately two more hours when the gauge reads empty. The heater works very well and heats our small summer cottage style home to about 70 degrees when the outside temp is 33 degrees.Edit: After just 2 months the manual shut off no longer works so now I have to jolt or tilt the unit every time to trigger the emergency shut off to extinguish it. Inside parts must be flimsy or cheap to fail so quickly. Very disappointing.
2,dislike,"My first purchase was the Sengoku or-77 it's easy to operate looks nice but it burns with a kersene odor. I tried adjusting the glo knobe to see if it helps with the odor and it didn't help at all. My second purchase was the Dyna-Glo 23000-btu it's great, no kerosene odor while burning and i use both kerosenes with dye(reddish color) and without dye(clear color). You don't need any additives to help kill the kerosene odor Dyna-Glo 23000-btu is great."
2,BOREING,This book was so boring. Its too technical and it does not contain enough of real life examples and stories. Its like it was written by a robot. Unless you're a psych major I would not get this book because it will put you to sleep.
1,never received!!!! it was not in the box with the other item!!!!!,"i paid for it............i told them "" i never got it""............customer service said "" i'm sorry""...........the last i've ever heard!! i have purchased more than 500 usd w/ these guys and they won't even try to ""soften"" my anger and frustration. esad"
3,Nice enough for the price,"These arrived quickly and to my surprise completely put together. I had purchased other fabric to cover the seat with and after unscrewing the seat, I wasn't able to get the fabric on in a way that still allowed it to swivel so that was disappointing.-It was a tiny bit chipped on a couple of the legs but nothing a matching sharpie couldn't hide.-They were a bit lose and rocky out of the box, but my husband tightened the screws and they were good and sturdy.-They don't swivel easily-a plus for me with kids.-They look very nice-especially for the price.I'm not in love with the purchase but who has $300+ for barstools-not this lady....Good buy since they aren't used much. If are looking for something inexpensive and nice looking-go for it!If you are looking for something that will be super sturdy and used a lot-you may want to keep looking."
1,Worst,It broke after 3 months. Don't recommend. It is not a solid wood but engineered one. I bought two but one survived. It looks great but durability is poor
3,Be prepared for a headache.,"I really liked the look of these stools. But it took 3 shipments of these to get 2 good stools. After receiving the first shipment both stools had broken or split legs on them. I returned them no problem and then reordered. The second shipment had 1 good stool in it. But I decided to go ahead and reorder before returning them in hopes that I would get at least one good stool in the next shipment. When I received the third shipment, again both were damaged again. But this time I decided to take the stools apart and swap out the bad legs with good legs. So finally after 6 stools, I was able to come out with 2 good ones. I am a little concerned with how easily the bar stools get damaged. I'm sure a big part of the problem is how they are being packaged. It's nice that they come totally assembled but not if it is causing them to become damaged so frequently."
2,Bar Stool Review,"The stools were loose and had to be tightened so the legs didn't wobble when you sat on the stool. One of the feet on one stool had about a square inch of wood peeled off. It was a good price, but the stool is not something I would have purchased if I had seen it before I purchased it. From a distance they look good."
2,Look nice but aren't sturdy,They look really nice. But were not sturdy as soon as they were taken out of the box. I know they won't last long.
4,perfect profile for a smaller entertaining room,these sit at my kitchen bar and fit perfectly with our modern/simple style. they are a great color and appear exactly as pictured. these were packaged well and came quickly. i was sitting on the edge of the seat and now the seat is bent that way slightly (i am 5'10 160lb woman) and also some of the wood on the bottom of the foot chipped off when that happened. not a huge deal because it is unnoticeable. but for the price you can't beat it!
4,Good for the price,"These are just as good as anywhere I could find local and less money, they are a bit narrower than I thought they we be."
1,Simply horrid,"If you're any fan of Georgie Fame, avoid this at any cost. Yes, there are a lot of tracks, and yes, all the charting hits are here, but that's about all the nice thing I can say about it. Sound quality is all over the map, continuing Raven's propensity towards pulling the easiest-to-find master and using it instead of doing their homework. Things are mono that should be stereo, and things that should be mono are in abominable rechanneled (i.e. phony) stereo. Fame deserves better than this. Save your money and find a copy of ""20 Beat Classics"" plus any of the UK CBS collections still floating around."
2,Not that great,"I bought this and a couple other tabletop fountain books, the 'Simple Fountains' book by Dorcas Adkins was much better. This book shows how to make the basic functioning parts of the fountain, but it looks like it was made by a 3rd grade art class - some of the fountains are just plain ugly."
4,Didj done good!,"If the didjeridoo is a favorite of yours, this CD will not fail to delight you. This CD feature eclectic as well as traditional styles of music. David Hudson's didjeridoo work is fabulous, especially in 'Animal Imitations...' and 'The Hunt.' A more informative jacket would give an extra star, but does not detract from the quality of the music. This is a must for anyone who loves the didj as well as good Yolngu music."
5,Some How Some Way - Luther Barnes and Red Budd Gospel Choir,"I purchased this CD having heard only one song - ""You keep on Blessing Me"" - I just had to have that song. Well, when I got the CD and listened to it I was hooked, I mean really. This CD is one of the top five in my rotation of gospel music. You will not be disappointed. A Good Buy!!!!"
4,Typical Luther Barnes,"Typcial Luther Barnes sound. The CD has a nice flow. ""Somehow, Someway"" and ""We Lift Your Name Forever"" are my two choices on this CD. If you are a Luther Barnes fan, this CD is well worth the buy."
2,Hannibal in Italy,"I have just read 35 pages of this highly recommended book. However on page 35 Fuentes writes...Hannibal, badly supplied, repaired back to his Spanish shelter, confirming Roman suspicions etc etc.I have read nothing about Hannibal ever returning to Spain after arriving in Italy. He campaigned in Italy 16 years, was joined by one of his brothers who lost a battle and was killed, then returned to Carthage where he was defeated at Zama. He fled to the east pursued by the Romans where he committed suicide.Does anyone have a reference describing Hannibal's return to Spain?"
5,"Enlighting, brilliant","Carlos Fuentes has a unique view of the world, putting together facts and actions that created Latin America better than anybody. Nobody can explain better and with such a brilliant analysis the History of world than him."
1,It's craptacular!,"Every movie has a right to be bad, but this one abuses the privilege.""Hellweek"" follows what seems to be the formula for half of the direct-to-video no-budget jobs on the market: a stock horror plot (this one vaguely knocking off ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" at points), bad acting, woefully incompetent film-making, a ridiculous overuse of the F-bomb in the dialog, and cheesy gore and make-up effects. Add to that a powerful streak of misogyny, a thoroughly repugnant main character, and a needlessly long frat party sequence that kills the pacing while contributing nothing to the story or characters, and you have a product that doesn't even amount to a so-bad-it's-good viewing option.Somehow the filmmakers managed to scrape up enough money for a very brief -- and pointless, and bad -- CGI effect. They should have spent the money on a script editor."
5,Hilarious,Definitely the best indy horror film I've seen this year. The thrilling plot and captivating acting make this a must-see. The actress who played Krissy (April Needham) definitely has a bright future ahead of her.
4,must see,i liked it. it was diff... one of the best inde... fimes i have seen not this same old same old stuff... i must say it got me to look at inde fimes in a diff light...must see
3,I actually the screener... duh...,"This movie is not yet in stock but I was part of a test audience in the USA. Incidentally, this movie has not even been screened outside the USA, so that guy who says he's from Prague is either really bad at geography or lying.That said, on to my review.Okay, Da Vinci it isn't, but a good time it IS. When was the last time you sat for 45 minutes to an hour in front of a screen without getting up for food, drink or a bathroom break? This is one of those throwbacks to the 80s kind of flicks that makes you glad you watched it. Robyn Griggs is creepy fun and I love the ""screw her"" line."
4,Good Pellet,This pellet worked well with the Benjamin 392. The only negative is that it was hard to load because of the flat head. I had to wiggle it around in order for it to load. But once loaded; it flies true!! A very good pellet. The free shipping is a plus since other online sellers want to charge over $5 just to ship one can to Hawaii.
1,Something wrong with Gamo Match Pellets from Amazon,"I just received two tins of Gamo 22 Match flat-nose pellets from Amazon, and the pellets are very poorly finished, and of irregular size and shape. Will not buy any more Gamo pellets.See the MANY bad reviews for these at Pyramid Air's website."
1,Canned,Can was open and the pellets were falling out of packaging the pellets that were left behind were mostly smashed so a review of how accurate these are would not be fair.
4,Interesting and elegant reading,"A new book by E.Zaltsberg focuses on the teaching and performing careers of 11 leading Russian Musicians,most of them pianists. Allof the musicians were born in Russia before 1917, and many grew up in the country's southern provinces. Zaltsberg presents interesting anecdotes throughout the edition, such as how the 11-year-old Anton Rubinstein performed at the Salle Erard in Paris with Liszt, Chopin, and Meyerbeer in the audience. Liszt wrote about the event,saying that""""Rubinstein is a brilliaqnt phenomenon in the field of piano virtuosity, and he will be my successor.""The musicians in the book are pianists Anton Rubinstein, Rosalia Pasternak, The Neuhaus family, Maria Yudina, Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, and harpsichordist Wanda Landowska, and violinists Adolph Brodsky, Nathan Milstein, and David Oisrakh, and the conductor Samuel Samosud.-James Seller,Clavier,Vol.41,No10,Dec.2002, p.43."
4,Exciting reading on Russian school of performing art,"Do you know that Rosalia Pasternak,a mother of the great Russian poet Boris Pasternak, was a wonderful pianist? Do you know that the Russian violinist Adolph Brodsky, the first performer of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, was a Director of the Manchester College of Music for almost 30 years? Do you know anything about the great Russian operatic conductor S.Samosud? If you want to know more about these musicians and some other towering figures in Russian performing art, you should read the new book of E.Zaltsberg entitled ""Great Russian Musicians: From Rubinstein to Richter."" It contains valuable information and references not easily available to English speaking readers, and as such is of interest to many music lovers."
2,About average,"I have to admit after reading almost all Jodi Thomas novels, this one was a disappointment. The books premise offered a lot of hope. Unfortunately the story never really captured my interest. I realized after purchasing the book it was reprint from 9 years ago. Perhaps this explains why the read is not the authors best by a long shot."
4,Great read,"As always, Jodi Thomas gives us deep characters with interesting obstacles to overcome. Just a great story and I never fail to learn something new about the ways of those tough, early Texas settlers. Enjoy!"
3,Not her best work.... straight out boring at times,"First, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of Jodi Thomas' books. But ""The Tender Texan"" just left a lot to be desired. First, the female lead is annoying at best. We get it... she was raped and had a tough life. Does that give her a right to be wretched to people for months when they have shown nothing but kindness? She acted downright heartless at times, with zero consideration for Chance, his feelings, or his future. Secondly, we're supposed to believe that Chance is a 20 year old, uneducated, rough and tumble texan. So why does he talk like a poet? If I hadn't paid so much for the download, I would have stopped reading long, long before the end."
1,A tiresome read,"I love this author and have read nearly everything but this one I wish I'd skipped. Agonizing slow, really annoying female lead character made you impatient and think that no sane man would deal with her. At 9.99 for an e version, there are much better reads by this author for half the price."
2,no subtitles?,Opera d'Oro videos do not contain subtitles. Most viewers will probably get lost unless they are very familiar with the libretto (and maybe know a bit of German). I would suggest Levine's Metropolitan version of The Magic Flute - it's an excellent performance and it has subtitles!
2,"well sung, but slow","This production was very well sung, but I found it rather dull. I have seen numerous other productions of the Magic Flute, and this one just lacked the life that the others had."
5,Pure Genius,"I first heard this in Scotland, back in '81. The first notes of ""In the Land of Giants"" totally blew me away. Great guitar work, excellent songwriting, great vocals. I've been looking for this on CD for years. A truly classic hard rock CD."
3,It's only rock & roll,"I bought this CD for one song, ""Battlescars"" with Peart and Lee of ""Rush"" playing on it. Superb song, so I was interested in Webster's other material. Even though there's some pretty good musicianship on the record, the songs themselves don't really push me over the edge the way that I expected. Every so often I'll go back and try to relate to the songs but they still don't knock me over the edge enough to etch themselves into my memory. Classic rock lovers and guitarists will appreciate this record."
2,Battle Scar was what I wanted...,"I'm a huge Rush fan, so I remember Max Webster from the late seventies as having ties to Rush, plus the song Battle Scar had Geddy vocals on it.So I bought it, and that was that. I listened to Battle Scar about twenty times, but the rest of it wasn't very good. At least not now... I'm sure fifteen years ago it was still relevant.anyway... this is good case for allowing us to just pay for a song and download it... it would have saved me 10 bucks."
1,"literally, a big ,heavy, metal piece of garbage","I used the jack 1 time to change my battery, it worked perfectly. I tried to use it to take my battery out in the winter and the whole hydraulics system was no longer working. I just barely threw it in the dumpster after trying one more time to jack my bike up. After carefully reviewing the instructions and disassembling and reassembling parts of it, it eventually broke in 3 places so i checked it. I would not buy a black widow piece of crap ever again."
5,Trama and Addiction,Excellent book on source and cause of addiction. Easy to understand and very helpful in knowing the whys of addiction. Points the way to recovery.
4,Great reference book!,Book arrived on time and in good condition. This book is an excellant reference for anyone addressing the needs of addiction and trauma related histories.
5,Very Good,Not only is this book give good information on the subject of addiction but abuse and child development as well. It re-defines addiction as a means to cope with trauma and traumatic childhood. This is a must read for anybody in the mental-health care related field or anyone with addiction.
5,Dual Diagnosis Insight,"This book was an insightful look at the crossover between trauma and addiction. Though I would not employ the psychodrama model, I did find it helpful in understanding the underpinnings of trauma and addiction. I think that the most helpful advise is to slow down to the clients pace and not push to re-traumatize in the name of psychotherapy. Developing ""emotional literacy"" takes time and patience. Tian Dayton gives a sensitive look at that process. I think most treaters would find useful information in this book."
5,Mewtwo returns...An epic film,"The first film featuring Mewtwo was intense enough, but this is great! To see all of Mewtwo's clones back from the first film. The clones like Venasaur, Blastoes, Charizard, Pidigot, Ninetails, Rapidash, Nidoqueen, Wigglytuff, Rhyhorn, Vulpix, Psyduck, Bulbasaur, Squrtiel, Dewgong, Gyradose, Vileplume, Sandslash, Meowth and Pikachu plus more.Mewtwo and his clones live peacefully in a land filled with healing water. Nidoqueen and Rhyhorn even had babies. But when Team Rocket envade the peaceful land, Ash and gang come to help. It's a great movie and this time the gang don't forget their adventure with Mewtwo!"
3,An Interesting Path For Pokemon,"This is review 4/10. This is an interesting path for Pokemon movies. Although most don't consider it one of the movies. This movie, from what I believe, takes place between Pokemon 3 and Pokemon 4ever. I liked Mewtwo Returns. I thought it was repetitive at times and I miss the CGI from the 'official' movies. However, I thought it was nice to see the return of Mewtwo. I especially like the DVD feature for the uncut story of Mewtwo's origin. I thought that was exciting. By the way, the Pikachu balloon was cute. I also like the fact that Mew wasn't in this movie as a main character."
1,Aghh! My eyes! My eyes!!,"What horrible animation! Overly glossy, computer generated garbage. And the ""story"", just plain awful. I could actually feel my brain shrinking as I watched this mess. I find it hard to believe that kids over the age of 4 enjoy this mindless nonsense and anyone else would voluntarily watch this Pokemess.Blech!!"
2,BOOOOOOOOOO!,"Almost every song needs to be cut in half. I understand where redundancy can be good in house music. but this album takes repetition to a new ridiculous level. tracks worthy of praise are 5 and 7. The production quality is awesome, but AVH needs to basically use 1 word instead of 5."
3,Cake Dome and Plate,"This is a beautiful cake plate and dome. I have to agree with another review however, it does not work as a truffle bowl as advertised. The price was really good so I kept it although disappointed that it didn't double for the truffle."
2,New Edition is Not Really New,"This book is supposed to be a new edition but there are only a few articles that have changed. Some outdated ones still remain. Unfortunately, there aren't any standards for what constitutes a new edition. This is a shame because students pay more for books that are almost identical to previous editions."
2,"Dated Material, Some over 40 Years Old","If you are looking for a topical discussion of technical and business writing, I think you can do better.That said, the book is a quick, informal, benign read. Though it purports to be updated, some of the essays go back to the early 60s.Some of the techniques discussed don't quite agree with the methods discussed in Mike Markel's ""Technical Communication"" or Carolyn Rude's ""Technical Editing.""If your instructor requires it for a course, buy it used. You'll likely sell it to someone else when you're done, as I will. It makes no sense to lose that much value on the resale."
3,"An adequate reference, a good starter","I'm an instructor of Business Communication and this is the textbook we utilize for the class. I find that most of the articles in this book are good ones; however, there is a lot of repetition, especially when they are referring to the writing process. YAWN. Boring. How many ways can you reiterate ""clear, precise, and to the point"" as the main idea?Otherwise, some of the other articles in there are great for those beginning in the world of business writing."
4,Dig The CDs,"I really like this compilation mixed by dom and roland (one person). Its got all the fat tracks: tudor rose by cappone, frogger by ryme tyme, as well as a few ota controll tracks from no other than BAD COMPANY. When I got this I was hopping that it would have son of nitrous (on the new Bad company LP digital nation) but sadly it did not. I was also hoping for the total science remix of champion sound but did not have that. Enough complaining, the cds are outaa controll, it at least sounds like it is mixed live (not always the case with compalations) and mixed well.I recomend this to everyone who is tired of light (soul slinger and his crew) or cheesy hip hop crosover BS( aprodite, his crew) and people who like flat out rough drum and bass, no nonsense and no garage."
1,A Big Blaaaaa,"... the next day I got it from bookmens at[a price] played it for two minutes and got tired of it. A big waste of money.Cons: Bad graphics,the dinos all look the same, and just boring...."
1,NOT an improvement,I bought this because I heard it was MUCH better than the first version. BALONEY! Its the same old boring game. Pffffft! Forget it!
2,Could be much better,"I've played this game for hours on end, and it is always a mixed bag. What is REALLY, REALLY annoying is how, when you're in a safe position on a hill or something, and you sound the dinosaur call, the critters all run away, no matter how aggressive you have them set to be. The graphics are primitive in a lot of ways too, like when you can see a dinosaur right through a rock, or one is swimming and it looks like it's in the clouds. It's a decent game, but could have been much better with a little more effort."
1,Carnivore Warrior,"This is the most fun game I have ever played on the computer. The graphics are awesome. I do not hunt in real life because I have no desire to kill or hurt God's creatures, but this game makes it fun to stalk and bag wild dinos. The sounds you here are sometimes very eerie and what you see makes you feel like you are really there. I can sometimes sit for hours and play and completely forget about the time. The game is kind of a good tension release."
4,Marc is AWESOME!,"The bootleg is okay - if you really want to see Marc's talent, get the CARENCRO CD. I love him - he is so talented. I saw him in concert and he does not disappoint.If you like blues, jazz and soul - you will love Marc Broussard."
1,Disappointing,"As with The Martial Spirit, there is some initial good information about martial arts in general, but tends to be very negative and contradictory at times. Focuses on the negative aspects and does not bring full light to the spirituality of the martial arts. Recommend Zen in the Martial Arts."
1,THE PIC. IS WRONG,the pic is for a seat post...THAT S A SEAT POST!iF YOU BUY THESE... WHAT DO YOU GET WHAT YOU SEE OR WHAT IT SAYS IT IS?
1,why not make a bluray region A/1?????,"I don't understand why this bluray wasn't made compatible for us in the US. The year is 2010! i thought for sure this year i could start adding blurays to my vhs/dvd collection of soccer goals videos, but i guess i'll have to wait till 2014 for a bluray that i can watch without buying a universal bluray player (if they exist) I'm sure the footage in this bluray is worth it, but it just sucks that it's only for region B or 2 :-("
5,Excellent compilation and great production,"Excellent compilation of best plays, all the goals, best saves etc and the final in full.Several angles of most plays and goals, great quality, stunning images.As it states in the description this is zone 2 so it didn't play on U.S. zone 1 PS3 (don't know about Blu-Ray players) but I could play it smoothly on my PC connected to my TV.Highly recommended."
3,instructions!!!,"Got my stove on Fri, nat gas type great little stove, love the look it goes with my antique home, works well.Problems: the optional blower kit seems like it is a universal fit for two many stoves , complicated instructions (not exactly clear) not a good on off switch setup not a good location should be a lot smaller.it should be put in with the controls behind the closed door.Just hope it does it job!Not for an amatur to assemble, you have to have a little knowledge of mechanics."
2,Not what Expected.....,I thought this was more of a 'how to' book rather than a less than interesting novel. Perhaps I would feel differently if I had finished it but I just couldn't hang in there. Sorry.
1,very disappointing,"This book had an exciting prologue but then the rest fell short. It was like someone wrote the beginning and then another person wrote everything else. the characters were not likeable and the story took a weird turn. I felt no cat and mouse chase. he knew exactly who she was, and she was set on her feelings in a kind of disturbing way. It was not what I was expecting it to be."
1,Snorefest from an old favorite,"After a long time Katherine O' Neal releases anothe erotic historical and it is unfortunately a snore. I just could not see a connection between Mason and Richard. I read the entire book because it was an expensive trade, but that was quite a trial since I kept getting sleppy after reading half a page. I cannot even give a synopsis because I've forgotten the plot right after finishing the book. I hope the next O'Neal book will be better, just skip this one."
1,Bad Home Video,"This video was TERRIBLE! I didn't think you could go wrong with video of bunnies, but it turns out I was wrong. I'm guessing this was a homemade effort- terrible narration, awful video quality, and dreadful editing- a lot of the video was visibly sped up to make it more ""interesting"", ugh... Even with the sound muted, my kids were unable to stand it."
5,Awesome,"Bought these for the first time a few years ago, and have stuck with them for all my toms. Amazing, just the right amount of muffle / ring for me. Very very easy to tune and stay tuned. Just fantastic heads."
5,Fun!,"Cute table cloth, well made, colors are very bright. Haven't washed it yet. Comes with a great little bag to store it in."
3,Super cute but shrunk in the wash,"Love this tablecloth but it did shrink some, even when washed in cold water. I would not put it in the dryer!"
1,largely agree with jaunticed eye,"I largely agree that this is not very entertaining. I agree with its premise that letting go of anger and resentment is very therapeutic. But it was awkward getting there and the case was not made that God is necessary to get there. That was simply claimed.The premise of a family's life secretly recorded by a tyranical father was full of possibilities but full use was not made of it, other than to say that the boy had every right to be angry. The acting and script were weak.It was nice seeing the son able to be happy at the end after he made a snap decision to forgive, but not worth the whole film to get there."
4,I Beg to Differ!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an excellent film that gives the viewer an inside look at the disastrous effects of religious delusion within any family. A so-called ""Christian"" scenario is presented here, though.I love the simplicity of the film. It is not presented in the typical overdone fashion of Hollywood films that are out there today.It is real and to the point. Highly recommended to folks of all ideological persuasions. Keep an open mind."
1,How the heck does this thing hang on the wall?,"Maybe I'm just cranky and tired at the end of a majorbath renovation; but I'm too picky about low-pricedfixtures; maybe this little gadget is just too simple for mymind to wrap around. OR MAYBE they need to redsign the darnthing!I've been trying to get those annoying little set screws tograb onto their corresponding wall plates now for about halfan hour. Does that sound like ""easy installation"" to any ofyou? Am I a total klutz? I don't get the engineering concepthere: the wall plate slopes and there is no place for the tinyscrew to grab on. This is just too frustrating..."
4,Very Precise - Very Esoteric,"This reference manual is best accompanied by a live demonstration and/or lecture. Like many arts, it is easier to demonstrate than to write about. Although well illustrated, it is still a reference manual that can be used to refresh your memory about the finer points of pressure point fighting, the 12 meridians, the golden breath, and human anatomy."
5,wonderful jazz compilation,If you are new to jazz or an old time jazz lover this mix will definitely make you happy for hours and hours. It's beautiful.
2,You get what you pay for...,"It keeps time, but it just feels cheap, and looks that way also. Time will tell how it holds up and it may do just fine (has for a few months now)."
4,Not Completely Unbreakable,"After a few hiccups unrelated to this product I was finally able to use the dishes. I was pleased by the appearance, nice color and simple design which could be both fancy and ordinary dishes. The bowls are nicely shaped, not that flat style so the kids can fill with cereal without spilling the milk.The one thing that I found to be a bit disappointing was the statement that it was unbreakable, per the commercials they will bounce instead. This is very true as long as it hits the floor a certain way. My daughter dropped her plate and true to the commercials claim it bounced instead of breaking. But when my son decided to test the theory himself with a bowl it did not bounce and shattered into a million pieces...because the bowl hit the floor on the corner of the bowl thus hitting the pressure point to cause the breakage. I think that the manufacturer should state this even if it's fine print so kids everywhere aren't trying what my son did."
3,Mug was made in China,I like the design but was rather taken aback when saw print at the back of the mug .... Made in China hoping that everything is from USA
5,Excellent and received as it is described,I was searching to buy this product for my mom to send india. Amazon selling at very good bargain after thanks giving sale. Received as it is described and in time. These sets are looking very beautiful and packing is very good.
5,corelle 16pc set,the best productlight weight n durablemy sister has been using these for the last 8 yrs n nodamage
4,As Expected,"I have a family and plates get broken if they are breakable. I like the Corelle for that reason. Nice set, and good price. Nothing fancy but good for what I need them for. I really like the cups."
5,Charming set,"Although I still revert to using my larger volume mug for drinking, this dinnerware set makes entertaining guests a breeze. The plates feels think but it holds up pretty well to everyday use and washing. I've served curry, and other foods that might stain cheaper dishes, but most caked on stuff washes off easily and leaves the plates and dishes pretty and white again."
5,Corelle should come up with a new model of this Set,"Bought it for under 21$ from sale with free super shipping. Solid as it looks. Needs no review, but I think Corelle should come up with a slight variation of this Set, as this is one of their best selling products. Tired of seeing the same old country design for years."
2,broken dishes,coffee cups came with chips in the rims. I was unable to take a picture to complete the claim process and unable to reach anyone by phone.
4,Worth to buy!,I am writing this review after a use and purchase of a year. Nice color and didnt fade print after daily usage. Amazon price is unbeatable and this product is worth to buy.
5,Correlle dinnerware,"I have had many types of dinnerware, and I am married 44years... and to the same man too. All of the dishes, the bowls, glasses, cups, saucers.. were chipped. No matter how careful I was, I'd have to toss them and buy new. I went to a garage sale, and got four plates, dinner plates.. and I liked it so much, I went online to find a complete set. Well I did. I am so happy with this new dinnerware, and Im even more happier about the fact that it won't chip on me. Plus its just pretty. I am very satisfied with this product and recommend it to anyone interested in a good product that lasts long, and looks elegant to boot."
5,Great and unbreakable dinner plates,"Cornell dinnerware set is an excellent product. I do enjoy using it everyday because it is easily to clean, and very hard to break."
3,corelle set,"I recently bought this item and i bought it mainly for the mugs. I thought they were the same make as the plates but the mugs are not the same type. They are the breakable porcelian and can chip and break. It just says Corelle at the bottom, but not the real stuff like the plates so i am not very happy with this product."
5,This is good,"I like this product as one of my friend recommended it to me. I like the design the quality and the product. When it accidentally got slipped on the ground, it was still fine, no cracks.Its a must buy and value for money.5 out of 5."
4,A gift that has lasted,"Although these feel fragile, they have stood the test of time in our crazy house for years.We were given this set when we moved into our first apartment. It wasnt my style, but that was ok.We continued to use the set for a while, while other misc brand dishes broke or chipped these ones lived through DROPS on the hard kitchen floor.This set feels like it would break easily because the plates and bowls are extremely thin and light. This is not the case at all, they are extremely strudy. The only design is that ""painted"" on, so they stack smoothly and easily.I have yet to have one dish, bowl, or mug break. Nor have they stained any.The only downside is I wish the mugs were slightly bigger. I'm guessing they hold around 5, maybe 6 ounces a piece."
5,"A bizarre, twisted, and wonderful experience.","This is not so much a game as an interactive horror story. It unfolds like a Clive Barker tale except with more humor. If you find chatting with kids with nightmarish deformities and walking on surfaces made of flesh your odd cup of tea, then you are in for a treat. I loved it, and introduced it to many of my friends. I didn't find it scary, but horrific, imaginative, and intriguing, filled with atmosphere through its carefully wrought graphics and sound. Especially atmospheric are the music and sound effects. It is a game like The Longest Journey in which you don't want the journey to end. --Incidently I've recently reinstalled my 4-year-old Sanitarium on Windows XP Pro (with SP1) and it seemed to work fine. The Level 2 bug patch (sanipatch1.exe) is still available on the net."
3,Good for beginners,"Sanitarium is not a bad game considering it was written in 1997. Most of the puzzles, however, are a bit too predictable for experienced adventure gamers...everything you need is at any given location. The only real difficulty with any of the puzzles is not being able to find a specific item, but with any perseverence, you eventually find it. Still, it's a good start for those just starting into the realm of adventure games..."
4,Fun Game. Graphics and puzzles not as good as MYST,Overall a fun game. I felt the graphics were not very good and the puzzles were fairly easy. Still it was enjoyable and captured my attention enough to keep going. I finished in two days and now I'm looking for another game to play. Any suggestions would be great.
2,Unchallenging and silly,"Sanitarium may have some interesting locations, but that's all it has going for it. I only played through to find out what was really going on, and, believe me, it wasn't worth it. Just think of the most cliched ending a game like this could possibly have, and you know how it turns out.During the game, the puzzles are so simple that they didn't even feel like puzzles. Playing Hide and Go Seek? That's a real challenge. The longest I spent on any puzzle was when I knew I had to dig a hole, I just couldn't find the danged shovel. It was right out in plain view, but the detail of the scenery caused me not to notice it.I would only recommmend Sanitarium to those who desperately crave a good-looking adventure game and don't care about the plot or puzzles."
3,"Irritating in some parts, fantastic in others","You've read the synopsis so I won't repeat it. Some of the places you get to visit are amazing, filled with interesting challenges. Other places are packed to the edges with characters you need to talk to -- at length, and slowly. Parts of the game deserve 5 stars, others deserve only 1. This averages to 3 stars, though I'd still recommend the game at this price!"
4,FAST Service,"These folks are quick on the draw, they must have hand carried it right down to the mail box! Would definately use again."
1,It does not run on XP,"Please don't buy the game thinking it runs on XP. It does not. I was on so many chat boards trying to find patches or help to make it run. It ran for a little and then would crash at places. What we did get to play did not impress me. However, others have said it is great. My 1 star is a little unfair because of the OS I was running.. but such is life."
3,Pretty Good Starter Adventure,"If you want a good adventure starter game and like 'unusual' mind-twisting; you will enjoy this game. I also liked McGee's Alice in Wonderland, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and Darkfall."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON WIN XP!,"You can't give it zero star so I am stuck with giving it one... Oh well, the box is kinda nice. But Windows XP users, beware: this game will NOT work on your machine despite what it claims on the box. At best, you MIGHT be able to play for a short while before the fatal crash. I went as far as playing it for 10 seconds. My verdict, useless piece of crap! This company gets on my black list for lying about its product"
5,Involving and challenging,"Sanitarium is a rare gem of a puzzle-solving adventure game. All puzzles are a challenge, but not too hard, and none are just there for the sake of being there (such as to prolong the game or frustrate the player). All levels relate to an overall theme which reconstruct one man's life. Each level is set in a world that the player must learn about and find clues to unlock secrets and eventually reach some goal. Levels include waking up in an asylum with no memory; a townful of mutant children, a circus, cave, and mansion, a lab where hideous experiments are conducted, and a few others. The background music was excellent, the learning curve was very easy, the puzzles were relevant and challenging, and each level was unique and had it's own story that logically relates to the overall story. I have played over a hundred PC games, and this is definitely one of my top five favorites. It is engrossing and rewarding. Worth buying by all means."
1,Sanitarium,This looked like a great buy. I'm very much into rpg/thiller games huge sh fan. Sadly the package says windows 95/98/me/xp????I have xpWell then why is'nt it working? If anyone knows the help would be awsome thanks Crissy126@hotmail.com
3,"XP users, there is a way...","I've run this on my XP, and have of course dealt with numerous crashes. I've found a way to proceed, none the less. As you proceed, if your system works with it at all, keep saving the game. When it crashes, start a new game and intentionally crash it in the Tower Cells, at the VCR. Then, reopen your saved game and go on. You'll have to do this a LOT, but it's gotten me as far as the Lost Village (toward the end). Unfortunately, am now stuck there. If I figure this out, I'll let you know."
3,Fast shipping but damaged product.,The book was supposed to be new but had bent corners and was torn around the corners. The front and back covers were bent and dirty. The inside of the book was in great condition though.
3,A good introduction,"A good, sound, easily understood and reasonably well illustrated field guide to the intricacies of coral reef tropical marine life. Basically aimed at the non-specialist reader, this guide features nonetheless very clear texts and excellent color photos, but the number of worldwide species featured is quite limited. For a much more in-depth, photo-packed and complete field guide to coral reef marine life worldwide, advanced readers, divers, snorkellers and underwater photographers should seriously consider the latest offerings by this well respected author/photographer husband-and-wife team, such as the spectacularly illustratedA Diver's Guide to Reef Life, the highly specializedA Diver's Guide to Underwater Malaysia Macrolifeand the truly informativeA Diver's Guide to The Art of Underwater Photography, Creative Techniques and Camera Systems for Digital and Film."
3,Street Medicine,"This is an important video, but could have been more informative. It was OK for awareness, but needs to be more specific if used for health personnel."
4,One of their best!,"This album is just a notch below Stone Blue as the best Foghat album. The title track is good along with ""Blue Spruce Woman"", ""Hate To See You Go"", ""Dreamer"" and ""Eight Days On The Road"". But, like one of the other reviewers, the best track by far is ""Chateau Lafitte 59 Boogie."" This track kicks and also has some outstanding guitar. Skip their most popular albums and pick this one and Stone Blue up first. You'll be glad you did."
4,this was my introduction to foghat,"and i've been a fan since. i first heard this album back in 1975 and in those days i was a stones, zepplin and who freak. not much else mattered. but this album opened up some doors for me. i just could not get over the rawness of some of the songs, eight days on the road for example. nor could i ignore the fact that this album just rocks and rolls from start to finish. it may not be their best album (fool for the city is i think), but this runs a close second.i wish i could have seen Foghat live. other than the beatles or hendrix i wish i would have seen these guys. great rock and roll."
4,classic Foghat,"This is one of my favorite Foghat albums. It seems kind of like an outgrowth of the ""Energized"" album, but with some growth or change. It's exactly what you want from Foghat - rockin' rythym, blues-based, slide guitar. My favorites on this album are ""Chateau Lafitte '59 Boogie"" and ""Blue Spruce Woman"". ""Chateau Lafitte '59 Boogie"" is one of, if not my very favorite, Foghat tune. It has a great beat to it, and tons of energy!"
4,Vibrant and Eye Pleasing,Brilliant colors bring to life little Nemo. The sheets have retained their great colors after many washings. They are a bit stiff but the children don't seem to mind at all.
1,DIFFICULT LEAKER,"Difficult to work with these hoses and all these adapter rings to get them to seal tight. This is not the product to have trouble with while you laying under a Toilet in a tight spot. I installed other stainless braided hose on other Toilets that had just a simple 3/8 female compression on one end and a 7/8 female compression on the other . Takes about 5 min.vs.30 min. or more to install. No tape, no compound ."
2,did the job but leaked,this leaked immediately even after using teflon tape . everything fit properly but the metal piece at the end of the connector attached to the part that screws into the water supply leaked. i used it anyways as i needed it to use the toilet and threw the old one away but bought a different connector at the store
2,Love it but it broke!,"This was the second ravensburger floor puzzle I bought. The first I had issues out of the box of the corners and edges being bent and torn from the first use (which was pretty gentle with adult sitting and helping) I read more reviews that talked about durability so I ventured to try again thinking it must have been a fluke. My son picked up one piece 3 minutes after opening this with my husband and a whole section ripped off. My son was not aggressive or rough at all. I contacted Ravensburger with no response.Good things about this puzzle, my son loves it and the picture/ puzzle placement is ideal for beginners. I adore ravensburgers designs.My recommendation is to look into the few Melissa and Doug square floor puzzles. We bought one of those shortly after these puzzle and it is much much more durable and thicker (in fact it claims 20% thicker than other brands)"
2,Adds nothing to your hair!,"I've had MOP brands before and was excited to find this on amazon. However, after using this for 6 months, I can tell you that it does nothing extra for your hair. Can be very drying and smells like dish washing detergent."
4,A Gift,I got this for a golf fanatic friend of ours and he loves it. Small size but lots of pages of wonderful golf courses. A great gift for any golf nut.
3,A golf course for every day in the year.,This is a beautiful picture book that features a golf course for every day of the year. During the long cold winters in Toronto it is nice to turn to a page that corresponds to the current date and dream of playing that course.The book features 16 courses in Scotland and I have played 13 of them.Book is highly recommended for the golfer who would like to experience world golf.
4,BEAUTIFUL,I bought this gift for my father-in-law for Christmas. It is an absolutely beautiful book and looks a lot more expensive that what I paid for it. It is well worth the price.
2,Below my expectation,"It has a thorough coverage on global courses and arrange them on a timeline basis. However the descriptions of each course is way too simple, more like talking about a point of interest, rather than providing the information appeal to a real golfer. And some of the photos are in low quality."
2,"Too fundamental to be ""secrets""","Nice for first-timers, lacking depth in more detailed areas-light-leakage, brilliance, scintillation, ymmetry,etc. It's easy to find a diamond with VG for polish but seldom the case for symmetry. Did not mention trends in diamond cutting, such as Eightstars, Heart and Arrow diamonds. Spends too many pages on mounting and setting. Subject title-ruthenium missing in discussion of Platinum on page 78. Typos in page 16,17,69."
3,excellent and beautiful but,"this is a fine brand, with an excellent eta movement, saratoga is a leading design in concord, But amazon is selling aftermarket watches, I have been buying from them, and most of the watches come without the plastic covering of the case and bracelets, some without security tags, dead batteries if they are quartz, and the boxes mistreted or dirty, this fine concord came like has I described, and small dirt ? black dot on the case, hard to finfd it out."
4,T. Texas Tyler,Let me begin by saying I am a Western Swing fan.On this this album Tyler's vocals are very well done and are typical of what you heard from most of the top Western Swing Bands featured vocalist of that period and in contrast to most recordings of today he recognized by name the instrumentalists who are featured players on the tune.On this release Tyler was backed by a number of the most revered Western Swing intrumentalists of all time.
2,Great while it lasts,"Having several cats, I was super happy with how this machine cleaned pet stains.However, after several months of use it developed a serious leak and could not be repaired.Just another piece of foreign junk in the landfill now. Too bad they can't make a quality product."
2,remanufactured Bissell,I was not happy with this cleaner I brought.......it was rebuilt and does not work correctly & leaks......I will think twice before I buy again
4,Priming is frustrating,"So this product must be plagued with this priming issue. Out of the box mine would not spray no matter what. I tried all the methods online but they did not work. But I am resilient, and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning/exchanging. I finally found a method that works, though it isn't for the faint of heart. Turn the unit off, and suck (yes, with your mouth) the small tip on the hose that dispenses the cleaner. Give it some good hard sucks, no liquid should be coming through though. Now turn the vacuum on and squeeze the trigger. If your luck is as good as mine, the fluid should start coming out. As far as cleaning goes, it seems to do the job on the my cat's hairball spots, which was the main purpose of the vacuum, so I am happy with the purchase (minus the priming)."
2,Useless,"If you have dogs and and kids, forget about using this. Just buy a larger and more expensive carpet cleaning machine. In the long run, it's worth the money. This thing will have you down on your hands and knees for hours trying to clean your carpets inch by inch."
3,cleans good but.....,"This product cleans surface stains very well but it doesn't pick up enough of the water/cleaner it sprays into the carpet. I've found that when using the automatic settings, after it is finished you need to operate the manual hand tool to pick up the excess water from the cleaning. I haven't had to use it for deep stains yet and don't really know how good it would clean these. I have a feeling it wouldn't do so well."
1,Remanufactured Bissell 1200R SpotBot Hands-Free Compact Deep Cleaner Carpet Cleaner,The cleaning productas needed for this machine are expensive and only do about two jobs per container. It does not work well. I have read otherwise so perhaps its the fact that it is a remanufactured item.
4,love it!,Product worked great! Great for people who have little kids or pets and need to clean up a mess fast. Cleaner smells good. I got a remanufactured one and it works fine. The cleaner was opened and half used.
4,Spot Stain Remover,My spot bot works well on set in stains and allows me to walk away. Only issue is cost of cleaning supplies but lower priced options are available.
4,A nice little machine.,"Upon opening some pieces were laying in the bottom of the box. I removed everything and noticed one broken piece and one missing for the attachment. One call to the bissel service dept. with a detailed explanation to live help and they sent a free replacement upon review of my receipt and the cord end cut off the bad unit and fedex'd to them prepaid. Within 5 biz days a new refurb was delivered free of charge and it worked great! As far as the use, it is a little heavy but it has to be to clean in auto mode. With unit in deep clean it goes through cleaner fast but does a good deep clean. The buttons are easy to understand and the hand attachment works good. Its definately a time saver in our house with 2 little boys. Thanx Amazon & Bissel!"
4,does the job,I used it to clean a deep seated stain in my carpet and it did the job. I also intend to use it to clean my carpets in my car as my big carpet steamer is just too unhandy. It is simple to use since it is automatic when cleaning a stain. The only con would be the cleaning solution is used up fast and is rather expensive.
5,BISSELL CLEANER,"The cleaner works great. No problems. I have 2 puppies and they have mistakes on my carpet. I keep this cleaner handy at all times. Just plug it in and the spot is gone. I would highly reccommend this product for quick spot remover,Denise Bodema"
4,Cleans SMALL spots nicely.,"The machine works as advertised, giving a wet soapy scrub and automatic vacuuming to spots about 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. Like most carpet washers, it leaves some water -- expect to wait 24 hours for the spot to dry completely.If your carpet tends to get small spots on it, this machine is ideal -- place it down, press Start, and walk away for 3 to 6 minutes.The reservoir is small, so you can only clean about 4 spots before emptying the dirty water and refilling the clean soapy water.There is also a handheld attachment for manual cleaning, but it's rather annoying to use because it is extremely narrow. Don't expect to clean anything wider than 3 inches, and expect to scrub a lot."
5,Gotta have this!,"Have kids? Have a dog or cat? I have both. You gotta have this. It's the quickest easist way to get spots out quick with NO hassle. I love it. Is it perfect? No, nothing is. But this is an excellent product for what it does. Don't use too much soap though, you don't need alot."
4,Gets out stubborn spots,"The earlier reviews were spot on (he he) for the performance of this machine. Stubborn carpet spots that had survived a number of ordinary carpet cleanings were removed by this thing. We also got it at a fortuitous time - a couple weeks later our Labrador suffered a serious digestive problem that made our bedroom almost uninhabitable.The tanks are very easy to change, and as others suggested I only use the chemicals in the tank when I need every bit of cleaning. Otherwise I sponge detergent on the spot before using the machine with plain water. (Laundry detergent solution works well for that!) And it does indeed leave the carpet wet, but a bit of finishing up with the manual wand (easy to do) takes care of that."
1,A new low...,"Marketers and advertisers base the majority of their life on the creation of false needs. Siegel demonstrates why it is that this ""tween"" market has become so interesting for businesses: this particular age group is old enough to make suggestions to their parents about how to spend their money but still young enough to be utterly manipulated."
5,Original sound for a hungry mind,"Quite intense at times, Hangedup's sound could make you loose control of yourself, trippy yet wonderful needed moments for anyone who needs to push listening into new dimensions . Hard to believe they are achieving this marvelous effect with only two instruments. Something wicked is going on here. I do know know if it's magic or pure genius, but this is an important record for anyone who believes to be a musician or just anyone who likes something other than boring repetitive nonsensical beats."
3,too glue-y .Messy!,"well i loved the color this imparted into my hair, but your hair will be like school glued together, and it didn't wash out that easy! it's too sticky and needs improvement...i'd just buy a spray color next time! my hair was styled nice, it's good if you want to spike your hair! or if you like the laquered -look"
5,great price great product,I was in need of an Egr due to high readings on smog test. This was lower priced than I could find locally it came quickly Installed easily . readings dropped way down. It has been several weeks now and it works flawlesly
5,Accurate historical account of a most unusual place.,This book presents the story of a most unusual place in Alaska. It tells about the beginnings and the development of a large town with a small population. I especially enjoyed the story of the tunnel digging and the problems with the timing and the elements that hindered the construction. It will most interesting to see the results of the new access by automobile that will be available. The pictures and maps were well thought out. The book sure makes you feel like you would like to visit there to see it for youself.
3,Live at The Brixton Academy,"Didn't realise how old this CD was, but the different spin on the style of music was a change."
1,almost painful,"It is almost painful to hear songs like Tie Your Mother Down, Love of my life, Headlong, Now I am here, etc without the powerful and amazingly beautiful voice of Queen's bigger than life Freddie Mercury.Those songs should never be sang by anyone else as nobody will ever be able to sing them as Freddie did."
2,Not that great,"Brixton features Brians usual (atleast until the last few years) stuffy and not very good vocals singing a bunch of his songs with Queen in inferior live versions then the group performed, his overrated Back To The Light with songs that failed to live up to those he composed for Queen and a cover song. As such this is not a good album and not one worth owning."
3,for youger kids,i read this book while in the bookstoore looking for oythers books.i thought it was a good discrpition of AS form younger kids. however i feel kid than are over 12 need An AS book too.
1,A Negative Look at AS,"I am thankful NOT to own this book. I found it during a library search and find it's message extremely negative. The book systematically points out some of the most difficult problems of AS - disorientation, obsession, miscommunication - as if all person with AS experience all these problems. Most AS individuals are uniquely challenged, having shades of these, as well as other issues. The most disappointing aspect to this book is that it doesn't celebrate the gifts AS children may have - expanded vocabularies, intelligence, honesty, a fascination for stories and books, advanced computer skills, and often, artistry. The book, ""Asperger's, Huh?"", is a much better choice."
5,"An amazing, insightful revelation into the world of Asperger","This book gave me a much, much clearer understanding of how children with Asperger Syndrome view the world around them. I shared the book with a friend who has a child with Asperger Syndrome, and she, in turn, has used the book to educate other family members and friends about this perplexing syndrome. A must read for anyone who knows someone with Asperger, especially family, friends, teachers and counselors!"
1,disappointed,"I ordered this to read to a second grade class to help them understand a classmate of theirs. The book presents Asperger's from a very narrow and negative standpoint and may be appropriate for 6th grade and up, but certainly not for little ones. The pictures are pretty dull too!"
5,Right on the Mark!,"AS is probably the most misunderstood disability today. In schools, these children are viewed by teachers and peers as odd, difficult, aggressive, and unstable. I used this book with my college students in a teacher-education class to describe this problem and you could see the lightbulbs go on over their heads. What a difference understanding makes! After using this book, I can now boast that over 100 new teachers are ready to recognize and appreciate the unique strengths kids with AS have and help them overcome their deficits."
1,Not everyone is the same,"The book describes a specific child, and says ""This is Asperger's"".Kind of like - ""She loves pink. That's a girl. She hates watching sports. That's a girl."" etc.Someone who is not familiar with Asperger's would, upon reading this book, would probably expect that all children with Asperger's are like that boy. But they are not.I was going to buy this book for my daughter, but it turns out that she is very different from this boy. There are several similarities, but also several things that are almost opposite. I'm glad I didn't buy this book."
3,Lacks Positive Characteristics of AS,"As a grown man with Aspergers, this book while hitting the nail on the head in a lot of aspects, noting the difficulty with social situations and making friends, the preference for structure and routine, the difficulty understanding idioms/jokes, unusual interests, and bedtime rituals. However, I believe this book, though not intended to be, is a bit negative in tone. Never does it mention the positive aspects of AS, including high intelligence and deep passion for one or two things (and these people typically go on to do great things). I think this book should be tweaked to provide a more balanced view of AS, including positive aspects, so those with AS don't feel so bad about themselves when reading this book (or it is being read to them)."
5,This game ROCKs,"This is the best wrestling game ever. If you have to get one wrestling game, this is the one to get. It has everything. The graphics are really good. It has a big variety of different types of matches and the real theme songs and videos of the wrestlers. You can also create your own wrestlers. This is the best game. And if you don't agree with that, KNOW YOUR ROLE AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH JABRONI."
1,This Sucks,It Wasnt even the right game i ordered wrestlemania 2000 and they sent me turok with a wrestlemania cover on it this sucks and it really makes me hesitate to order from here again cause they wont let me get my money back
5,the easiest wrestling game on earth!,"the controls are very very easy to pick up.you can,with very little real effort do spectacular feats of dexterity and skill.you can also make your own wrestlers.no i dont mean some wanker with someone elses moves.i mean you make him and you program like 180 different moves into him!theres like over 10 types of suicide dives alone!it rules!if you dont like the guys you get,you can go in and change them also.you cant change the moves,just the appearence.youll be on medium level in no time!"
4,The Best Wrestling Game Out There For N64,"This is the best wrestling game for Nintendo64. Better then Warzone. Better then Revenge. Better then all of them. It has great graphics, many wrestlers to chose from, a lot of arenas and ways to fight, and does not get boring easily. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you should only buy it if you like wrestling."
4,wrestlemania vs revenge,"This game is exactly the same as WCW Revenge. nice new entrances, cool create a wrestler mode, but gameplay is virtually the same, execepting the fact that hard mode is not just ""the computer reveses every move there is""; you actually have to fight back. If you have revenge, don't bother with this game, but if you don't, BUY IT!"
3,WCW/NWO Revenge was a little better.,"This game can get boring after a while, like one thing the road to wrestlemania is to hard I cant earn shawn michaels, they cheat terribly they block and reverse all the time."
5,It doesn't matter what the summary is!,"Simply put, this is the best wrestling game ever created. It is just like WCW for 64, but a million times better becasue it's WWF. You can play with all of the characters and use all of their moves. It is very realistic and a blast to play. Anyone who watches WWF Raw or Smackdown must buy this game."
1,sorry for you thq,If you could only buy one game do not buy this one.I mean the wrestlers look like they were made out of a bunch of balls it is a stupid game it has very few modes and if you buy a wrestling game buy thq's very own wwf smackdown the best game ever over any genre.with 12 modes including i quit match with a microphone where you can ask your opponent wheter she or he wants to quit and the great title matches you can make up in exhibition and the special ref. where you can count slow or fast or not count at all.WM2K IS A GRADE F- FOR ME
5,Wrestlemania 2000 Review...,"This game is one of the best wrestling games that I have ever played. There are no bars at the top of the game that tell you how much strength you have left, just a very cool meter at the bottom that shows your wrestlers as being cold and slow or hot and happening. The create a wrestler is simply amazing as you can pick and edit attire, (Clothes) and even pick from over hundreds of moves to personalize your man's fighting skill instead of your face. (Moves win matches, not custom face engines...) You can even choose different taunts that can be used to tease or badger an opponent, which adds more realism to the game. Wrestlemana 2000 is well worth the money as it is the most realistic wrestling game ever released! Loads of fun, and the blood can be turned off if you feel it's not appropriate for children. Highly recommended!"
2,RIP OFF!,"This game, first off all is WCW/NWO Revenge with a WWF logo. The moves the controls the setup even the music is almost Identicle with few differences. Next the idea that I have to scroll through a bunch of matches that I cant fight. I have a tv to see fights, I get games to play. fact that I have to change around what the characters look like to get an acurate feel is terrible. Xpac is fatter then the Rock when you start out. I dont want to waste the time in changing austin from a XXXXL waste to an L. The only good parts were the special moves, the fact that they had movies and intro themes, and that I can make Test look like a fat/tall Kane/Mankind. RENT THIS GAME DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY TO BUY IT."
2,Maximum Frustration,"Ok, while I enjoy the singles matches and they have some really cool features, I got my butt kicked last night as I wrestled the Hardy Boys with Mankind and the Rock. That's just not possible. The editing mode and the singles competition is cool, but the computer controlled wrestlers pretty much kick your butt all the time - even on easy - in the ""Road to Wrestlemania"" portion. Even if you honed your skills to a razor's edge on WCW/NWO Revenge, it won't help."
1,its old,"This game sucks.The graphics are blocky,the sound is weak,the superstars are old,there theme music is outdated,the weapons dissapear if u drop them on the floor,the crowd is horrible,the road to wreslemania is long and boring AND theres only a few match types.This game really sucks, if u really want a good wrestling game i suggest u get 1 of the smackdown games on ps1 and ps2 but if u only got yout N64 i suggest u go for wwf no mercy even though its still old but its the best wrestling game on n64."
1,horrible horrible,do not buy even horrible for the time but please read this and take consideration thank yougraphics for time 2/5fun 1/5gameplay 1/5thank you for reading this i made the bad choice of buying it you dont have to
2,An 8 year wrestling fan's ultimate disappointment,"For all the hype and all the great things that have been said, this game did not live up to it's expectations. Perhaps others have gotten drastically different copies of the game than I did, but for me, this game was horrible. The graphics are sub-par, with the wrestlers looking little to nothing like their real-life counterparts. In career mode, the computer will counter nearly all of your moves, giving you nothing but frustration and headache. If you have a short temper, or are just not a fan of games that don't live up to their hype, avoid this title."
5,Just as good as WCW/NWO Revenge.,"WCW Revenge was fantastic, and this game uses the same controls, very simple to learn, and it adds more spice to the ring. Fantastic."
2,Wrestlemania 2000,"There are many different things that I didn't like about this game. First of all, it was too difficult for me. Even when the game is set to easy, there are some players, in Road to Wrestlemania mode, that are just almost impossible to beat. They avoid every grapple and they counter every move. I also didn't like the fact that the characters in the game looked nothing like they do in life. Such as the Hardy Boys, they look nothing in the game like they do in real life. The only reason why I gave it any stars was because the graphics were okay and it was somewhat possible to win the matches with a lot of practice."
2,WWF WRESTLEMANIA 2000 N64,I didn't think this was that good. The wrestlers have the time didn't have arms. I was very dissapointed.When i got it I always played it but then once I got attitude i stopped.
4,Fun Game!!!!,"Just 4 years ago, I lost this game in Hurricane Katrina, and after recently playing it at a freinds house.....I couldn't resist but to buy it again!!!! This game is just pure fun to play, and has a huge and awsome roster of superstars, most of which are rare due to the fact that they don't appear in modern day games. Overall, this game is very fun, and I can't wait till it comes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,wwf wrestlemania 2000 for n64,"I thought that this game could have been better. The road to wrestlemania mode was too time consuming.Another bad part is the graphics are somewhat bad, however it beats wcw mayhem by a long shot. Another bad part is when you use a weapon and put it down, it disappears, I hate that part. Overall it was fairly good. :)"
4,This game is one of my good games.,This game is one of my favorites but not the big momma. I got this for a present eventhough I knew nothing about WWF. I like the replays and the moves. This is just an average game.
5,Great buy Great Game,"Great game. How can you go wrong with Wrestlemania2000? I was shocked to see how many wrestlers I could create, and how many wrestlers were in the game. WWF Smackdown! is the only game that could compare, plus their both WWF games. Only people who can make a game this good is WWF. Now I'm just waiting for more match options, like Ladder match, hell in a cell, inferno match, something like. But for now this will do along with WWF smackdown!."
4,Gane rateing,"This Game is the most electrfying wrestling gane on the nintendo 64. Sure I may Be a ROCK fan But I know my games. This game offers The avarge three game diffucalty levels The 'create a character' feature is my favorit. I just wish it had more varity of maches. This is all they hvae: Singel, tag team, Thriple threat, and cage. other than that I give this game ten fingers up. NOTE: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STRONG AND WEAK GRAPPLE is very hard to figure out Not even I could figure out the Diff."
4,Very good WW II espionage story,"There have been many books written using the French Resistance as a backdrop, but this is one of the best I've read. Although it's a work of fiction, there are numerous references to actual people and events that help lend authenticity to the plot. Descriptions of deception techniques used on both sides of the conflict provide historical details that add to the overall intrigue and suspense. The author did a good job conveying the sense of constant danger for those participating in clandestine operations behind enemy lines."
4,The Tractor's best to date,"Bought the Farm is their most consistently strong album to date. Captain Tractor is best at doing covers of old sea chanties, like ""what do you do with a drunken sailor"" but their original songs were always a bit weak, something you wade through to get to the cool songs. But, on this albums, all songs are equally great. I especially like Dublin Lullaby, and Frozen Puck to the Head. I'd highly recommend checking out the Tractor, if you like groups with a sense of humor, like They Might Be Giants, or Dead Milkmen. And it's worth checking out their older albums too."
1,This thing does not work. That's it in a nutshell. Don't waste your money.,"This thing does not work. That's it in a nutshell. Don't waste your money. It can not cut 1 slice of potato or onion or tomato or even bell pepper. It wastes food and gets dirty. Too difficult to clean. If you save any time and energy in cutting, you will be spending in cleaning it."
4,ALMOST Everything!,I found the Nice Dicer to be all it said it was except for the fact it didn't do good with tomatoes. It saves time and is easy to clean and I love it!
4,Great Product,"I have it and love it, so I bought this for my mother, she loves it too!! you have to know how to use it. I am having a hard time with the carrots and sweet potatoes, but it does work great for dicing onions (on the bigger blade) the only thing I use the small blade for is zuchinni for a soup. the bigger blade is great for salad, but you have to cut up the veggies first to fit the area. if veggie is too big it will get stuck. I make french fries with the bigger blade (I use red potatoes, leave the peel on and stand it up sideways so you don't have to cut up first) (they are delicious) and I make sweet potato cubes with the big blade as well, bake in the oven with some oil and brown sugar, on 375 for an hour (tastes like candy). all in all it saves me ALOT of time in the kitchen with the preparation of salads and potato side dishes and soups."
5,Fabulous,"I love this little gem. I can make a professional chopped salad in about five minutes with each dice being perfect. This is great for an obsessive cook! I even bought one for a friend who was spending an hour on each salad. And she loves it, too."
3,great while it lasted,"A friend gave this too me as a gift and I was wary at first - till I tried it. It then became my best friend because I make a lot of salads and southwestern-style dishes that require diced onions and peppers. Tomatoes are too messy and carrots too hard, but it even worked on daikon radish rounds. I don't know what vegetable did it in, but suddenly, the blades were crooked and it wouldn't work. My husband and son now have a new job - straightening the blades with pliers until I can find a substitute product that is more reliable."
5,You read Battle Cry?,"If you did, you owe it to yourself to find a copy of this classic. This is so real that at times you will find it unbelievable."
4,Master Mason Edition of the Holy Bible,"The Bible was ordered for my father. We received the Bible in a timely fashion. Upon receipt, we were pleased with the condition of the Bible. Overall, we were pleased with our purchase.Thank you"
4,Nice but...,"The case is gorgeous solid metal. The perfume scent is authentic. The only reason I dropped one star is that I was expecting a cream solid, not a powder solid. I recommend the joy solid; just know it is a powder."
3,"Good book, Damaged by Racism","This is the second Upfield I have read. Death of a Lake was quite good-a later book. Given the early date and that the book is written by a white man who decided at the last minute to make his main character half aborigine, I suppose you might excuse him. However, I found his blatant racism interfered with an otherwise interesting story. I can't go into details, or I will spoil the mystery. I have read many older authors who use racist terms and ideas for brief moments-here it constitutes an important part of the story.If this bothers you at all, my recommendation is not to read the book. If I read another, I will get it from the library."
4,Best of the Pottery Barn books,"I have read/used three of the Pottery Barn books listed in order of my opinion of them: Baths, Living Rooms, and Bedrooms. Baths was very good, with beautiful photographs, interesting and innovative ideas, and some useful design advice. Most of the book provided a several page showcase for an individual bath with discussion of what made it special.Living rooms was OK. It's content was more canned, but it still had some inspiration and enough ideas that were useful that although I would not put it amongst the best such books, it was worth an hour or two to browse.Bedrooms hit the bottom of the list for me. The content seemed especially canned. The ideas were not fully developed and most of them appeared to me more appropriate to someone's first apartment than an established home (so it just needs the right audience?). Lot's of the pictures involved just using eclectic pieces and did not involve actually developing a decorative theme."
5,Just lovely,Such a lovely book. There are so many ideas and elegant ways to improve the look and functionality of a bathroom. The pictures all convey designs and ideas that I'd like to have in my own home. Thank you Pottery Barn.
2,Great coffee table book.,Great book for showing on the coffee table but that's about it. A few good pictures but mostly displays houses that don't look like they are lived in. They use bizarre decorating materials in some instances (straw? really?) and I didn't really get any inspirational ideas from it.
1,Plenty of Drama,"""Plenty"" by David Hare is a fascinating portrait of a woman searching for happiness and stimulation after a secret, thrilling youth working for the French Resistance. Susan is perhaps David Hare's most interesting character ever. This play is one of the most unpredictable that I have read lately. I highly recommend it, particularly for David Hare lovers."
4,"Great sound, but lots of work to get to it","I've had the 2080 for two months. It's taken an while to get it to work, but the sound and functionality is great.The manual leaves a lot to be desired. The remote is an unintuitive challenge to figure out. The unit doesn't include the SVHS inputs that the higher end models have.Kenwood wants you to be happy and offers phone support and a web site. The web site isn't great. Like the remote, it's hard to figure out.But when you've finally gotten it to work, the sound is really magnificent. If you buy it, get it to work, and have good speakers, you will enjoy the sound.The good or bad news is that only you will be able to figure out how to work it. So if you're a control freak on your equipment, have no fear, you will have no challengers."
2,"Great looks, mediocre component....","I bought the Kenwood VR-2080 about 5 months ago. I have to admit that it does a lot of really cool things, but then there's a lot of bad things about it to. The remote for instance, It's really cool how you can use the LCD screen to control everything, but what good does it do you you if it takes you a minute before it actually establishes a 2-way connection with the reciever, it doesn't work past 18 feet or so, I really wish I hadn't bought this reciever when I did cause I saw the great price... Right now, I have no idea what's wrong with it, but no sound comes out. I think there's a short inside one of the amps or something. If you want a good reciever, don't buy this one, go with one of the Pioneer ones of comparable value."
1,Wouldn't recommend,"This bag was not what I expected. We own a Harley Davidson Road King and this bag will not mount on the windshield. The description makes you believe that it will mount to any bike, but it doesn't fit ours. It's too stiff and doesn't match up."
1,aawful awful awful,"I am an undergrad student of CS and a A+ Certified computer technician. I just hate this book. I have never seen a book so stupidly verbous. If you want to get tired with Windows 95, just start reading this one."
1,Don't buy!,"Bought Nautilus NE2000 Sport Series in 3/07. Not used much. Paid $2000. from Watson's. Arm from foot pedal into back frame is a square peg going into a square hole. Has rubbed to round hole. Foot petal starts clicking, gets loose and then separates. Won't hold when tightened. Warrantee does not cover any moving parts, which is just about anything except electrical. Now looking at a $300-400. repair bill. Won't buy Nautilus brand again. Only gave it ""1"" because there is nothing lower."
5,A perfect addition to your Wisconsin collection,"Cleverly written and simply structured, any sport enthusiast is sure to appreciate this book. Doherty includes everything from humorous player anecdotes and several personal interviews to the origins of today's well-known traditions and the history of the team. This book is a must have for all Badger fans!"
5,This book is a must have,This book is a must have for Badger fans. It is a fantastic way to relive Badger football memories - well written and entertaining!
3,2003 issue from 1996,"this is actually a show from 1996 in Poland. The sound is fair but overall the DVD is pretty good. It has current (2003 or so) interviews with members from the current band. If you haven't bought any Purple DVD's, this is NOT the one to start with. Go with Australia 1999 or Bombay Calling as the sound and video are much better. If you are a Purple freak (and realize that Steve Morse is one heck of a guitar player who can outplay Blackmore) then this is a good release."
3,Just OK,This study only covers a few chapters of Isaiah and doesn't go in depth on those. It was a bit disappointing.
5,Better than Good,"What can I tell you? Read this guy! I don't know what he's doing or where he is now, but the series is more than worth it. If you like Douglas Adams, Robert Rankin, Roger Zelazny, Greg Costikyan - well, you'll love Mr. Brenner."
2,It falls apart,"The parts are easy to fall off, and they do not fit that well. The hood always pops up in truck mode. It is a design issue. It is quite hard to transform. Not good for kids under 13 because it is just too hard to play with"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"This is a piece of junk, way overpriced and I was shocked how each part falls off, it doesn't stay together, very aggravating for an adult never mind a child. The pieces end up everywhere........very disappointing........."
2,"shop around, spend a little extra before you buy this unit!","don't be lulled in by the low price - not worth it! spend extra!this bandsaw has basicaly been pushed aside in the corner of the garage and I pay to have my metal cut, off-sight. This thing is basicaly ridden with glitches - the blade comes off more than it stays on and very frustrating and time consuming to put back together and adjust.. I ended up spending most of my time putting the blades back on, replacing them (breakage) and adjusting - this was cutting simple miters on 1 inch angle !! I finally gave up on the thing. I can't recommend this saw !rob"
1,Comically Awful,"Man...I can't believe how unlistenable this album is! I love the whole hard rock/metal genre, and I picked this up after reading Martin Popoff's review in his INDISPENSABLE Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal. However, he is WAY off base here. The only possible good reviews for this piece of tripe would be from someone who listened to this in the '70's and has warm, nostalgic feelings for it, because it is terrible! If you want '70's hard rock, skip this! This album is about as heavy as the Little River Band. Don't get me wrong, I LIKE the Little River Band, but not this waste of time. You want '70's, go buy Tyranny & Mutation from BOC, or Rocks from Aerosmith, or Montrose, or Double Live Gonzo. The only thing entertaining about this CD is the ridiculous clothing the band is wearing on the inner sleeve! Avoid if you know what's good for you!"
5,This is a rich meal for the ears...,"Not as polished as ""A Million Vacations"", yet more sophisticated than ""High Class In Borrowed Shoes"", Max came up with something special here. There's some hot rockers and slow ballads, but dynamics abound. There's a very special vibe in songs like ""Distressed"" and ""Hawaii"" that is hard to explain. ""The Party"" adds the wacky trademark, of course. ""Beyond The Moon"" is a grand finale (eh Geddy?) indeed. Nice and hearty rock'n'roll for those of us who crave just a little bit more from our music."
3,not so great,"I was sorta dissapointed in this CD. Sure, If you had my love is a good song, but only a few others in the CD are ok"
1,A dissapointing debut,"Having not even listened to the album, I can safely say that it is sorely dissapointing, lacking both in emotion and good tunes. The melodys seem to be lacking the same flair as that of other artists around at the moment. I have only heard the single, and the only reason people buy it is cos she is as fit as ****!"
3,not to great,Jennifer did ok i was a little bumed ! she didn't do as good as she could have! try again jenifer maybe you'll do better next time. I think we should give every trying music artist a chance.
3,LATIN IS IN!,But is Jennifer Lopez? I hav to admit If You Had My Love is a great song and she has a great voice but I suggest you buy the single. The other songs are not even half as good as this.
2,One or two tunes worth a listen,"The photos on the cd insert are almost worth the price of the cd. The music, for the most part, isn't. Emminently forgettable stuff."
3,This CD Is The Funniest Thing I've Ever Heard,"I give it 3 stars solely on its comedic value. Didn't anyone see her terrible lip-synced performance on the Blockbuster Awards? She's so obviously a studio creation, and not a very good one at that..."
4,GOOD,"this is a pretty good cd. i think that jennifer is great at singing and dancing. i've seen her live on the television so i dont know why everybody says she sings bad. i think shes not one of the best, not one of the worst, but better in the middle part. her songs and voice has a latino sound to it and its great. there are some slow songs but hey, everyone needs to slow down a bit once and awhileand one thing. why are all you people comparing her selena and dissin her cause she isnt that great as her? i know selena is better than jennifer and i dont think she doesnt want to ""steal"" selena's fame. so please,listen to the music, dont compare her to some great legend and say shes trying to be like her."
5,Love it!,"This is my first Jlo album ever, yes I have a guilty pleasure of listening to her, I won't lie. Mi cansion favorito, ""No Me Ames"" or my favorite song is ""No Me Ames"". It's a sentimental and sad song, translated from a Italian poem, well that's what I heard. And Marc Anthony does the duet beautfiully with Jlo! And another favorite was ""Should of Never"" and of course, ""If You Had My Love"" or ""Waiting for Tonight"" in English and en esponal! Recommended for those who listen to Jlo!"
1,This just isn't very good.,"Ok, I tried to be nice but she deserves this. This album bites. She released all the songs that are half decent and left all the crappy remainders for those who were suckered into buying this trash.AND under NO circumstances should you repeat same songs in the album. What she could have done is put ""Una Noche Mas"" on one of the singles or something but she just forces you to listen to more of her music.This album is a mix between boring and downright painful to listen to. This is why downloading MP3s has become so popular. Because you could download ""Waiting for Tonight"" and ""Feelin' So Good"" then leave the rest on the shelf of the store and save your time and money.The highlight of this album was the pictures inside the sleeve."
5,5 stars for Ms.Lopez!,"Jennifer lopez's debut album is a great cd! I love it. Songs like if you had my love, waiting for tonight, no me ames, and feelin' so good are great songs on here!!! I love them all. I suggest that you buy this cd, its well worth the money."
1,Feelin' so Bad,"I had very high hopes for this album. I really liked the singles ""If You Had My Love"" and ""Waiting for Tonight"". The whole album is generated with horrible beats and too many corny songs. I think that Jennifer has a great voice, but this album did not work for me. I really appreciated that this album incorparated latin rythms in it. This could've been a good album, but it was simply overproduced. This cd, in my opinion, is not worth buying. If you like any of her songs, I advise you to buy the singles."
1,SI JENNIFER PUDIERA LEER ESPAñOL..PERO NO CREO...,"...sería lo mejor, porque podría decirle lo avergonzada que me siento de que sea ella quien represente a la mujer latina tan prominente y desfachatadamente. La pobre jura que todo el mundo se cree ese EMBUSTE que es ella. ..pero qué suerte que su TALENTO la sacó del 'ghetto'...Cómo es posible que a esta basura se le llame música? Esta niñita no tiene la menor idea lo que es ser LATINA -- de latina no tiene na'...! Le di la estrella porque Amazon no me dejó darle 0. Ha sido comprobado que las personas que le dieron más de una estrella a este CD no tienen oído musical. Los que le dieron 5 estrellas TRABAJAN CON ELLA! Money talks!"
1,Do you really think this woman can sing?,"Besides the quality of the music being dull, ordinary, run-of-the-maill dance/pop, JLo CANNOT SING! Her delivery is bland without a touch of emotion. Recently I spoke with someone who has worked on the sound engineering for her recordings and he said that the technology that is usually used to smooth over slight vocal imperfects (minor bleeps & glitches) they used on her voice to correct all over the map, up to an entire note. The fact that someone like this has a career in music is astounding and disgraceful. When there are people who have real talent out there and are struggling and who will never be heard on the radio, JLo has made a singing career out of low-cut dresses and a big booty."
1,Failed Actress Fails at Singing!,"IT'S JUST BAD, although I do get a kick out of listening to the limitations of her voice every time she tries to hit a high note. Perhaps that's why they teamed her with Marc Anthony on ""No Me Ames,"" where his voice draws attention away from her. As for the song, ""Let's Get Loud,"" I find it hard to believe that Gloria Estefan meant for that song to get recorded, unless it was a practical joke on Jennifer...note to Jennifer, there's an ""s"" in the word ""gusta,"" so you don't pronounce it ""gu'ta."" It's sad to see such a bad role model for Latinas. You can wrap her up in Channel, Gucci, or Prada, but she's still a tired street girl."
1,"No voice, No talent, just body","You know you're lucky you're with the ""wanna-be gangsta"" (puffy), it's because of him, (oh yeah you also better thank Marc Anthony for putting you up there for a while) that you are even known. You are not a good actress, and thanks to technology you sound ok, but even that can't hide the fact that you cannot sing. Go back ""On the 6"" and find some other talent. Do modeling at least. Your body is all you got. Plus, the lyrics to that song ""Waiting for Tonight"" was originally written by some other group that never made it either. How ironic, your not going to last that long either. Take my advice, do modeling!"
1,Don't quit your day job,Jennifer Lopez can sing...NO SHE CAN'T. This album is a joke. She is one of the worst singers I have ever heard (right next to Briteny Spears). Her album wasn't even all that. She had 3 decent songs. She sounds like a cat being drowned.Miss Lopez needs to brush up on her acting and keep the singing to the professionals.
4,Shocked!,"Jennifer Lopez can sing. Who knew? Her sassy voice with straight up R&B beats was a plus for her debut. 'If You Have My Love', 'Waiting for Tonight', and more were some of the songs I enjoyed on the album."
3,Nice Premier!,"To Start, I see Jennifer, simply as that-- herself! On this debut, you can feel the hip-hop, and the spicy flavors, which are a part of her, as a person. I'm witness to her rise in fame...and this debut seems ""totally"" Jennifer. I don't see her as attempting to emulate Selena OR Madonna, and believe that other listeners, should give her the credit, as well-for doing her own thing. The quality of singing definitely has room for improvement...but she's off to a nice, up-tempo, enjoyable start!"
1,Get Back On The 6 Train Back To THe Bronx,"Damn, this album was the worst Album. If she wasnt from one of The 5 boroughs (BRONX) I would have gave here 0 or ZERO STARS. I'd rather see her Body and Talent on the movie screen or back on ""IN LIVING COLOR"" dancing again. IF She wants a hit Hook Up with the YANKEES and get a homerun- cause this album was a strike out."
1,Is this a sick joke put out by sony?,"I can't believe all that hype was about this album. Honestly it stinks, its poorly put together, and her voice is very average, so whats the attraction, i don't know i guess she will end up like all the other actor turned wannabe singers did ex(Don Johnson). oh well what can we do but hlp each other out by warning everyone, SAVE your money it stinks, and her lyrics are so silly and dopey that you can't sing along if you wanted to. One star is being generous, the worst song is waiting for tonight and that duet with marc anthony."
2,Stick with acting,"Jennifer Lopez probably won't win any Oscars but she's cute and she's got great screen presense, but what she does not have is a the ability to sing well. She can dance though, I'll give her that. I think that if Jennifer Lopez stuck with alto rather than straining to hit the high notes, she'd be better off. It might also help if she settle on a cohesive overall sound. If You Had My Love is catchy and has a good beat, but is too often marred by her embarrassing falsetto. Her current single wisely positions her voice behind the music - well, actually no. The music isn't that great either. It's almost like listening to her from underwater, but I doubt the song would be any more impressive than the music. Otherwise, her album skips from one musical style to another without her leaving her mark on any of them."
1,Jennifer es una verguenza para nosotros los hispanos,"Pues, nos pinta como cuerpos esculturales pero, sin cerebro. Y de verdad, tenemos gente con talento que crea arte y no basura. Un buen trasero puede comprar todo lo que quiera."
1,Where's the talent?,"I think Jennifer Lopez is famous for all the wrong reasons. She isn't the greatest singer in the world and if her video is supposed to be a reflection of herself then it seems like she's a little self-centered. Her vocals are disappointing especially in ""If you had my love"". I admire all the people who managed to extract something good from these musical monstrosities. I however could not force myself to find anything good in any of her songs. Sorry Jen but this is my honest opinion."
1,OH MY GOD!,"Usually a movie star crosses into music because he or she has some talent. This was either a mistake, a publicty move, or a joke. This should get less then 1 star. She has no musical talent. She should stick to her day job... wait a second, she aint good at that either."
3,"A ""Selena"" look pero not a Selena voice","Jennifer is an amazing actor.Her voice is not all that bad to me if someone's voice sounded as bad as most people are making it out to be they wouldn't have made her album in the firt place.My favorite song is ""NO ME AMES"" it is beautiful and Jenn's voice in it is too.The album is pretty good for her first one.Come on everyone this is her first album cut her some slack.Everyone has different taste that's why the saying ""that's why they make fords and chevy's"" is true here.She is a beatufil person.She is pretty good just needs a little work.Kepp working Jennifer..you'll make it."
1,Diaster,"The ""If You Had My Love"", is the best tune to offer from her album. It was sad and disappointing that ""Puffy Daddy"", Big Pun, and etc. made this album out of a mockery. If I had to chose a producer or producers for this album, I would keep the producer of ""If You Had My Love"" and I would have commissioned Babyface, Dallas Green (TLC), Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson), and Will Smith. Please that Gloria Estefan tune belonged on her Congo album. Chin-up Jennifer and try again."
1,Where's the talent?,"Being a Puerto Rican from New York, I am very sorry to say that I didn't like Jennifer Lopez's CD. I only like music that I can FEEL and she puts NO feeling into her songs. Also she has a weak voice. I believe Marc Anthony did her a big favor by agreeing to do a duet with her. The tropical version of ""No Me Ames"" is really the only song on this CD worth listening to and its only because of Marc Anthony's terrific voice. If you want to listen to some good R&B try Monica, Brandy or Mariah Carey. Better yet, listen to some good latin music by La India, Olga Tañon, Gisselle, or anyone...except Jennifer Lopez."
1,Truly Embarrassing....,My brother bought it and played it on the hifi and wow...Yeah it is that bad. I thought Britney Spears is the most embarrassing package to emerge this year. Guess she got a companion now. Jennifer should go back to her acting instead.
2,Not as good as expected,"Jennifer Lopez' debut album ""On the 6"" disappointed me. Her image is that of a latin goddess, but instead of the sexy, husky voice we are used to hearing in her movies, like ""Out of Sight"" and ""Selena"", you discover that her singing voice is a lot higher. The lyrics lack soul. The one good track on the album is her duet with Marc Anthony, ""No Me Ames"". It is a beautiful, hearttugging latin song. Still, Jeniffer should stick to the big screen and ditch recording."
5,JENNIFER!,"The If You Had My Love single is awsome, I can't stop listening to it. This girl is going to be big."
1,Bad bad bad,"I bought this on the strength of if you had my love. Guess what? I was miserably disappointed. That means only 1 thing: Get back to pure acting. And you know something? if you had my love gets irritating after the 100th time. So, please use the money you intended to buy the cd with to save some wildlife or orphans elsewhere. Simply not worth it. And Miss Lopez's voice quality? Give me erm, Homer singing in the shower anytime!"
1,"Keep ""Waiting For Tonight"", I'll be asleep in bed!","Yuck! Jenifer thanks she can make all of us boys buy herc.d. just b/c she is striped down to a sweater and her panties!O.k. she is a little pretty, but who buys ac.d. for the front cover anyway!Moving on to the music itself, there is boppy/pop music that is on the edge of being flat out annoying. If you would like an example, the song ""Waiting For Tonight"" goes: ""I'm waiting for tonight..............................WOOOAAAAHHHH! "". While this seems o.k. @ first, it becomes REALLY bad after about the 57th time! I have yet to meet somebody that has listened to the c.d. all the way through without speeding it up, or just turning it off.As if boppy/pop music is not bad enough, midway through the c.d. a big fat greedy rapper comes on the c.d. to blab about the fact that he ""never shares his money"", oh wonderful! END"
2,Forgettable,"I've always liked J.Lo. I mean yes, I know she can't really sing or act but there is something about her I like. Which is why I got this album. With all the hype around this album I thought it was going to be amazing but it's not. Out of 12 tracks (I'm not counting No Me Ames ballad version or Una Noche Mas because it's just Waiting For Tonight in spanish) only 5 of the songs are good.1. If You Had My Love2. Feelin' So Good3. Lets Get Loud4. Waiting For Tonight5. It's Not That SeriousEverything else is weak and forgettable and sounds like the same song just with words in different places. Singing ain't for her"
2,run of the mill,"This debut album by Jennifer Lopez works only because of her undeniable star power. Most of the songs on the album are very average and similar sounding ballads. Only 3 songs stand out. ""If You had my love"", the first single, produced by Rodney Jerkins, is a sexy dance number which reminds one of Toni Braxton's booty call classic ""You're makin' me high"". ""Waiting for Tonight"" is a very Mariah-esque house number, not unlike Ms Carey's own ""Someday"" or ""Prisoner"". Perhaps the best song on the whole album is ""No Me Ames"", her duet with Marc Anthony, which is a breezy latin ballad which evokes summer, palm trees and lazing on the beach with a cocktail in your hand. The Puff Daddy-produced ""Feelin' so good"" is the worst song on the album. It ranks as Puffy's worst production effort yet, even though it features a rap by Latino MC, Big Punisher. Jennifer Lopez will probably evolve with her subsequent albums, but for now, she is stuck with a very average and uninspiring debut album."
1,On the image.,"First of all,this ghetto chick is just another britney spears who cant sing and relies only on image to sell records.This chick cant write,produce or sing and is only a puppet of the commercial music industry.All of the lyrics are boring and the music isnt even good when you think about it.She is a terrible role model for her community,as she is saying that all puerto rican women are easy,greedy and self centered.Dont support her music and vote for my review."
2,"Jenny, stick to acting!","When I was about 11, this C.D. was really good. I thought this was a great party C.D, with a few good singles on it that everyone loved to sing along to. In the long run, I've grown up,and realize that this album is mediocre, at best. Jennifer Lopez is not a singer, to put it bluntly. She doesn't belong in this industry. Now I would MUCH, MUCH! Rather listen to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. People that belong in the music industry and possess real vocal talent. This C.D. was only good because it was ""new"" and it was a time when everyone loved J.Lo. Now I believe people have had enough of her and Ben, but I digress...This isn't worth your time. Listening to it gives me a headache, and you easily outgrow these songs. Go away J.LO, go far away."
2,Embarassing!,"There's something about Jennifer that makes me love her to death! Maybe it's because she's a latina who came up from nothing and made it big. I admire her in that way because I'm a latina, and I love to see our raza succeed. BUT holy hell- this girl can't sing. I think she has SOME of the greatest songs out there, but she doesn't need to be singing them! Jen struggles to hit notes and we suffer through the song. She has sex appeal and a good attitude and morals. Jen can't act that great. She was great in ""Selena"" and ""Enough"". Plus ""Monster-in-Law"" was pretty cute and funny. But this lady should be modeling cuz she's good to look at- that's it! I don't know how she made it so big from dancing cuz she sucks at that too! I'm not hatin' on her. She's gorgeous- yes, but that doesn't mean the girl has talent!"
5,Jennifer Lopez is very talented,"I think that Jennifer Lopez is not only smart and pretty but very talented. I think that she did a very good job with her first CD. Some of her best songs are ""No Me Ames"", ""Could this be love,"" and ""Should have Never."" Her voice may not be that strong but she sang beautifully on ""No Me Ames"" with Marc Anthony.I think that people are being too critical of her and should give her the props she deserves for a job well done."
2,"Some catchy tunes, not very catchy vocals","Jennifer Lopez is an excellent actress and is one of the most beautiful women in the world. She is not a singer at all. This album, though some of the tunes are catchy, her singing is nowhere near good. Stick to acting, Jennifer"
4,good,"because the amazom shoping guide does not have a listening section to jenifers cd i have only hird her video on mtv. i realy liked the song, but she seems concited in the video. all she does is flaunt her body."
3,OK so she can't really sing all that great,"But neither could Madonna when she first started out, but sheer determination and raw talent proved everyone wrong. Jennifer Lopez looks good, sounds ok but as an overall package is great. I'm a converted fan. Its a nice album to listen to."
2,Missing real good songs,"She has 1 real good song, If you had My Love. ""No Me Ames"" and ""Waiting for Tonight"" are Okay. ""IYHML"" was missing the part where she dances. I suggest get the single."
1,Simply Booty,"Ickypoo,Ickypoo...I never heard anything this weak in my life. Ummm,what if she had a proper band behind her and not all those machines that make her sound passable on record? Proves that the CD is simply booty. Bruce Willis,John Travolta and other celebs tried to be singers, but just didn't get it right. I'll hold my breath untill Cindy Crawford comes out with a grind-core CD.Want a sultry latina rock diva-Cristina Martinez-Spencer of Boss Hog,enough said..."
3,A good Start!,"I didn't expect that her Debut-Album is so nice. She didn't have that great power in her voice, like Whitney or Deborah, but her voice is soft and the music is worth listen to. You can enjoy the whole Album, but she has to work on her voice!"
1,"Tell yourself, ""Relax, no reason to get all x-cited!""","I was disappointed. Besides IYHML, there are only 2 more good songs on this album, ""Waiting For Tonight"" and ""Let's Get Loud"". If you likethe latin groove that is popular right now, but, you're sick of 'LIVING LA VIDA LOCA', you should like ""Lets Get Loud"". Besides this, the only other good song is ""Waiting For Tonight"". You may have seen the video for this on MTV or VH1. I agree that the songs and the vocals drag on this album. Listen to this at the wrong time and you'll be ready to put it away for a year!!! She has an ok to moderately good voice, but she needs to find music that lets her take her range to different levels. She also needs music with just a little bit faster rhythm to it."
3,Lopez-O.K.,"'If You Had My Love' is a big hit around here and so is the music vid. The album is, well kinda O.K. and after listening to it a few times it should be put aside for a month or so. Good effort but still shaky!"
3,Just to point something out....,"I've only so far heard two songs off her album, ""If You Had My Love"" and ""Waiting For Tonight"", but I like what I've heard. Jennifer has even said that she doesn't want to conquer the music market, she just wants to make songs that everybody sings along to. Well, she definitely has me singing along. I don't expect her to be a resurrected Selena, and I admire her honesty. I give the album only three stars because I haven't heard it yet. I will probably end up buying, because I like to dance, and those songs I have mentioned are perfect to dance to, and sing to!!"
5,"I LOVE JENNIFER,AND THIS CD RULES!",This cd is full of great tracks!There are some great jams and some great love songs!I got it the day it came out and still play it all the time!She is by far the best female artist ever!I LOVE JENNIFER!
3,not too shabby,"If you like pop/dance music and singing along to your cd then this cd might work for you. my favorite tracks are ""feelin' so good"", ""should've never"", ""open off my love"", and ""it's not that serious"", and especially ""let's get loud"" great upbeat track. alot of ballads yes, but definetely some good upbeat tracks."
2,left me hanging...,"i bought this cd because i liked 'waiting for tonight' and 'if you had my love' - but it turned out those 2 were the only good songs! i felt the rest were missing something - and there was no punch to it. she has a lot of slow songs, and it's fit for background noise - you hear something, but don't know what she's singing about because she's whining. i was disappointed overall."
2,Mediocre and Ordinary,"Someone once said that it is much nicer to see a singer/musician try their hand at acting, and that an actor trying to pursue a recording career was....not as nice. That little afterthought definately applies to Jennifer Lopez, who somehow managed to gain great success with this cd. True, the albums two best cuts, 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight', were released as singles, giving us the impression that the album might have other worthy songs to boast. That is not the case, unfortunately, as the rest of the album, with a couple of exceptions,is nothing but mediocrity, especially the ballads, which do nothing but show what a thin, weak voice Lopez has. All in all, a truly subpar effort."
2,Stick to the screen...,Yet another pretty face used to sell a studio producer's pet project. Es muy mal.
3,SHE CAN'T SING BUT...,"Ok let's be honest here, Jennifer Lopez is not a singer. Who is she trying to kid? She has a real thin voice. What does help is the slick production. The songs are really catchy. It's really polished, but it works. Songs like ""Should've Never"", ""Feelin' So Good"" and ""Let's Get Loud"" are great. But my fave is by far ""Waiting for Tonight."" I can not wait for remixes of that. As much as I enjoy the duet w/ Marc Anthony (I like the version w/ Yuri & her husband better)...his voice just totally outweighs hers."
3,It was alright but not spectacular,"This was an OK CD. I just bought it a few hours ago and I'm already sorta sick of it. The songs are too origional. Im not a big fan of the spanish talk either which there is alot of. Especially at the last 2 min of ""Should've Never"". She's whispering in Spanish the whole time. It's an OK CD and if you like her song ""If You Had My Love"" then you'll probably like the rest of the songs on it but that is the best song on there. If you dont like ""If You Had My Love"" then dont get it because the songs dont get much better than that. But overall it was an OK album."
1,Limited vocal ability,"She can sing; However, her vocal ability (limited) sounds pretty much like any other top 40 female pop singer out there. At the very least, Jennifer is trying to look like Vanessa Williams and dance like Janet Jackson ( sorry, these ladies are in a class of their own; It's called talent and style)..."
1,you've got to be kidding me,"i recently heard her for the first time on the radio - her ""hit single"" is nothing but a computer-generated piece of garbage. it's not even her singing!! i just don't understand how anyone can see this as a great piece of musical work. i think it's a hoax and a sorry shame that albums such as this get so much exposure, when truly talented artists (who can write more profound lyrics than those about lovin', lyin' cheatin', foolin' etc.) cannot get any airplay. if you're a pop culture junkie, then i guess this album is for you: it's a piece of junk."
1,not good at all!!!,Its such a bad album that I can't believe it was so popular well thankfully the hype is winding down about it. She is so low class and has no talent the album exemplifies that! SAVE YOUR MONEY>
5,Too Sexy!!,"Jennifer can heat up the room! There are song's with lyric's that need an ""R"" rating, sooooo sexy!! Then you are transported to a completely different style of music that just keep's coming. Caution...do not listen to this CD alone!!"
4,Not Bad For A 1st Time,"Really it aint half bad.. sure her vocal work is not the best her vocals are much better on her newer stuff (Brave; Love?) but it has some of her older work and hits like ""If You Had My Love"" and ""Waiting For Tonight""Overall: 3.5/5"
1,she is average looking and cant sign worth frijoles ! please,JENNIFER LOPEZ is pretty for an average girl but not any kind of diva i am sick of her conceited video on mtv with her walking aroudn with a video camera watching her as guys drewl over her in ahh at her it is annoying she is really nice in the mtv fanatic she was really sweet and her acting is alright in selena she did wonderful but the rest of them moveis i never saw because they were really bad looking movies she has a alright body not the best but defenently not the worst curvey and full its cool but face average anyways if i was in her possision i would kick her out of stardum
2,Trying to find talent where it isn't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'd like to first come across and say that Jennifer is a very beautiful girl but I heard a couple of her songs in the radio and some on the net can we say NO SKILLS!!!! She should just stick to acting because she has no kind of singing talent. The only reason why I gave her two stars was because the duet she did with Marc Anthony is kind of catchy and Marc Anthony is truly a singer!! If you want my advice, buy Marc Anthony's cd better because in her songs all you'll hear is the sound of a screaming cat!!"
1,Did her voice get flattened by the 6?,"Ok so Jennifer Lopez is hot. That's all she has going for her. This girl can not sing a beat. She held together fairly well on ""No Me Ames"", a terrific duet with Marc Anthony. Only problem was, Marc had most of the singing parts. ""Promise Me You'll Try"" was a good song, but everyone else stunk. I'm not ""Feelin' So Good"", because it's ""Too Late"" to say no to this CD. If you respect music at all, record a few songs from a friend, and end it there! Save your ears the torture like so many of us have regrettably already done."
3,On the 6,"This CD has some very good songs. I especially like Lets Get Loud and Waiting for Tonight. This CD is really cool, but not all of the songs are worth listening to. If you just like one of the hit song titles like Waiting for Tonight, I suggested getting a single because you will be sorry that you purchased the entire CD."
3,OK,"Jennifer Lopez is no diva. She can act, but not make music. Her music is OK, but does not compare to the likes of Madonna, Celine Dion, or any other diva. She has good backround music. She isn't the best singer but she can make wonderful dance music. She is an awesome dancer, whether she's dancing to pop or latin music, the music showcased on this cd. She dresses to impress, with every thing from a bikini to a tanktop and jeans. She should go back to acting, but this still is an ok dance, pop, adult cotemorary, latin album. I reccomend it only to some people who like latin dance music."
5,"Shake You're Booty, Jennifer!","I just got this album last week and wished that I had it a lot sooner. True, her voice is still very limited, but it will get stronger with time, you'll see. Madonna's voice was the same way in the begining of her career. Now listen to her voice! I think that the same thing will happen to Jennifer. She is very talented and will release a ton of albums in her lifetime! I love Could This Be Love, Talk About Us, Should've Never, and Let's Get Loud."
5,"I'M ALWAY'S "" FEELIN' SO GOOD"" WHEN I LISTEN TO THIS CD!","THIS CD IS THE BEST CD IN THE WORLD.""IF YOU HAD MY LOVE"" AND ""FEELIN' SO GOOD"" ARE THE BEST.I ALSO LIKE ""LET'S GET LOUD"" AND ""IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS"". GET THIS CD.YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
3,Has musical talent but too many Latin-related songs.,"Before I listened to On the 6 by Jennifer Lopez, I thought she had no musical talent (that the only reason she wanted to record an album is because she wanted to try music now). But it came as a shock to me that she sounded good when listening to her album. Her songs would get anybody dancing except that she should try something different than songs related to her Latin roots."
2,YIKES SHE NEEDS WORK~!!,i dont like this album but i'm going to give her credit for trying. i only like 2 SONGS OUT OF 14!!! if she makes another album i hope its MUCH better then this one.... she has the voice to become REALLY big like britney spears and christina aguilera but get some FASTER beats. her songs are mostly luv songs and there all slow pretty much. hope u do better Jeniffer!!
4,Ballads,"On The 6 by Jennifer Lopez is a respectable debut album. You may have known her previously from movies or even when she was a dancer for Janet Jackson during the janet. era (1993-95). Janet was one of her greatest teachers. This album is good, the songs you hear on the radio are only the beggining. We all know Waiting For Tonight, If You Had My Love, Feelin So Good, etc, but the other songs are WOW. She should of released some of the ballads (like Talk About Us or Should've Never). One complaint: where do you find the video remix version of Waiting For Tonight, it would of been nice to have been included here. I reccomend this cd."
1,CATCHY SONG BUT NO REAL VOICE TALENT!,"The song, ""If you had...."" is catchy, but it grows old and there is no real voice. She needs to stick to acting!"
1,Stick with just acting chica!,"WOW did this cd suck! Hey jen you should really just act,singing is definetly not your thing.Hey maybe if she got singing lessons her cd would be worth actually buying!!!!!!!! SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"she's no ""SELENA""","the music is good but it'll take MANY more SINGING LESSONS... and the GRAMMY goes to JENNIFER LOP... NOT!!! oh yeah JENNY JEN, you can stop acting like SELENA... i've seen a few of your performances lately and i noticed that you're doing ""SELENA'S"" trademark dances... did't you finish playing the SELENA role 3 years ago?(-_*)"
2,You Go GIrl,I think Jennifer is a great actress singer and not so much of a good dancer but you go girl!!!! you keep on making us Boricua's look good keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!1
2,needs alot of work,"jennifer is sexy, jennifer can dance, jennifer can act but jennifer cannot sing. her music is very nice but she needs more coaching to compete with other divas in training out there like brandy monica and britteny."
1,"Great Actress/Dancer, vocals very weak, machines helped some","Jennifer, what were you thinking? I am a big fan of your acting and dancing talents, but you are not a singer!!! I respect your right to try, but give it up. I exchanged your CD, but I did like the video. Lose the blond hair, does not blend with your skin color. Stick to reds and brunettes."
3,"GREAT FIRST HALF, kind of dull by the end.","I was really impressed with Jennifer Lopez's debut, until I got to ""Promise Me You'll Try"", after that it is not that great with the only worthy song being ""It's Not That Serious"". Other highlights, If You Had My Love, Too Late, Feelin' So Good, the incredibly funky Let's Get Loud, Could This Be Love and the incredibly sexy and sultry Should've Never. Good debut, hopefully she won't rely on the ballads on her second CD. If I were only reviewing the first 6 songs, 4-5 stars easily, but since there's the whole CD, it drops to 3 stars."
1,"MAMITA IS FINE, BUT CAN'T SING!!!!!!!!!","Jennifer Lopez is one of the most beautiful women in all the world, and I even think that she is a great actress. However, the best part of her album was the pictures. If it wasn't for Marc Anthony, this CD would probably be thrown in a box, to never be heard of again! I would rather have downloaded the pictures from her website, than pay $15 for this CD."
4,A CD That Gets Better Every Time You Listen,"This CD is, I think, best after you've listened to it a few times. I love Jennifer Lopez, but her voice isn't that distinct. (It isn't bad though.) And most of the songs are pretty generic. The biggest standout is ""If You Had My Love,"" a really great, catchy song. I also really like ""Let's Get Loud"" and ""Waiting for Tonight."" Most of her songs have a nice beat...the only song I don't like is ""No Me Ames,"" which for some reason is on the CD twice. Overall, it's worth the purchase. To take words from 'Feelin' So Good"": Jenny, you da bomb!"
4,"Looks Great, Sounds Real Good",Jennifer has one of the sweetest faces and voices on film and now on record too. The songs are catchy and refreshing at the same time. Many instant hits for people into dance and pop and looking for something a bit unique with the sophisticated Latin influence.
1,Milli Vanilli's real voices are better,The first single off the album is catchy and the chorus is good but she didn't write it nor is she singing the chorus. Her voice is awful the worst voice I've ever heard. It just goes to show that anyone can make an album if you have the right connections and people writing for you.
2,"Great actress,Great dancer, Mediocre singer","Even backgroud vocal is better than her voice. Her first single is actually ""the boy is mine part 2"" and it should be better to sing by Brandy. All ballad songs in this album are lame except duet with Marc Anthony. Her voice is quite the same as Lisa Lisa & cult jam or Expose' with now out-of- date."
2,Don't quit your day job Jennifer!,"I believe Jennifer Lopez is a talented actress but she doesn't have strong enough vocals to become a real singer. Her videos are hip and cool and are possibly the reason people are going to buy her CD but I think if you carefully listen to her, you can tell she's really trying. I caught her rendition of ""If you had my love"" on the Letterman and it was no wonder the backup singers were singing louder than her. I think Jennifer should seriously reconsider acting because it's one profession in which she doesn't have to try so hard."
2,stick to what ya know!!!,"don't get me wrong ,jennifer lopez is my favorite actress and she is very pretty and i want to give her all the props in the world for her talents(acting).in selena she was great in anaconda she was brillant but on her album SHE SUCKS. come on jennifer if you don't got it you don't. it's great she's trying to get around and be known for music and movies but she only get's 2 stars for her music talent...i mean garbage. if this was a new movie she would get 5 plus stars but pleeeeeeeease re-consider your not mariah, monica, or whitney. all i'm saying is let's stick to what ya know...acting."
1,Garbage!,"I personally didn't like the cd. I like mostly pop music but also some hard rock and latin. In the CD it seems like she is trying to be someone who has done this for years and knows a ton but Jennifer admit it you don't know what you are doing. I f you are thinking of buying this Cd, don't, it will be a big dissapointment."
1,A male perspective,"Obviously everyone giving out five stars here is either pre-pubescent or male. So here's another male perspective. ROTTEN in GOTHAM! This girl doesn't need fans - she's already madly in love with herself. You want to hear real talent? Try Estefan, Tanon, Hawkins, Jackson, Madonna. You think she can act? Try Streep, Paltrow, MacLaine, Sarandon. This girl ain't even close."
1,Horrible,"Who the hell is this chic anyway. This album is horrible ""If you had my love"" is a good track but in Jennifer's case it could have been sung by a real artist. She really wants to blow. She should stick to trying to be an actor. i saw her on Letterman and i almost had a heart attack after hearing her. She sounds terrible. Jennifer, not everyone can sing baby. And she got nerve to diss other people in the industry."
1,I think We've found the 6th Spice Girl Fluzy Spice,"I respect, i mean i used to respect Jennifer as an actress, she was one of my favorites in fact, but in the last year she has lost it... this album is very weak, little to catch the audience... like the spice girls she can not sing... to me a good singer has to be able to carry his or herself live... so i have dubbed her the 6th spice girl, Jennifer should not have quit her day job"
2,Too much engineering; not enough singing,"This CD had potential...she's got a great pop voice, and, of course, a diva presence. On first listen, I felt as if I could really, really like this disc. But the more I listened to it, the more bored I got. The slow songs are feelingless; the fast songs are great for dancing or working out, but it seems as if she's relied too much on what they can do to enchnace her sound & not enough upon her own talent. Her delivery is young & inexperienced, I think she will get better, but this offering's biggest offering is its potential that she will be the diva the media hype has created her to be in the future. The girl can sing ~ just not yet."
2,"Okay, It's not the worst","On the first listen of this cd all I could think of is that this was one of the most boring cds ever. There are a few bright, upbeat moments. I really like ""No Ames"" with Marc Anthony because I love the spanish language, and ""Waiting For Tonight"" is okay. The rest is very dull and it doesn't seem that Jennifer's voice has a very large range. It seems that she sings the same five notes over and over except in those two songs. I will give her credit; it is not the worst cd I have ever heard and if I had to, I would listen to it if I was without any other cd rather than listening to nothing."
1,ONE STAR,"I should have known better than to buy this CD everyone told me it was going to be a studio creation, and I did not listen! well i am telling you DONT BUY IT! its really bad , I feel emabarrased for her thats how silly the lyrics are. anyway I am turned off I liked her in ""Out of Sight"" but now i think shes trying to jump on some latino bandwagon. ok back to the point, THE CD is bad, lyrics are dopey, and her voice is hard to tell because its a lot of stdio stuff and she has never sung live so i think that says something."
1,Jenny... Jenny... Jenny...,"Who told you this would work? It amazes me how overexposure will sell anything. Put your clothes back on, sit at the piano, and SING darling... and watch how this won't sell. Marc Anthony saved you on one song... and MTV saved you on the others. It would've been nice if you, as an Ambassador for Latin American women everywhere, would have dignified us with more talent and less skin."
3,"PASSABLE, BUT KIND OF DISAPPOINTING","Ok, we all know that Jennifer Lopez is a great actress and dancer. I mean, she has a pretty voice, but it's not that special. Plus, she doesn't write her own lyrics or music. On the positive side, some of the songs, ex. ""If You Had My Love,"" ""Feelin' So Good,"" ""Let's Get Loud,"" and ""No Me Ames,"" deliver a great rap/salsa/pop beat and cool tunes. ""No Me Ames"" was my favorite because when she paired up with Marc Antony and sang in Spanish, it sounded really beautiful. So if you're a Jennifer Lopez fan, buy the CD, but if you only like her hits you're better off skipping those limp, boring ballads that make up most of the CD and buy the single."
1,Terrible.,"I didn't enjoy this at all! None of her songs are good! It's all a bunch of cutesy stuff about how good looking she is, and how hard she is to ""get"". Unlistenable."
1,You have got to be kidding!,"This is music? Doubtful! Get a grip, Jennifer. Your acting is okay but your singing leaves a lot to be desired. You sold out and you obviously have forgotten where you come from. You'll make a few bucks on this - show enough flesh and everything sells. But when everything starts to sag, talent is what will carry you through. So save your money and invest it well... the gravy train won't last forever."
1,The Ultimate Studio Creation...,"I guess anyone can get a record deal if they bang Tommy Mottola. Did anyone see her terrible lip-synched performance on the Blockbuster Awards? It was her pre-recorded voice doing the main AND backing vocals! Plus she couldn't decide which part to sing. She flipped back and forth mid-lyric. Please, go back to movies..."
4,Not Bad!!,"When I first heard that Jennifer Lopez was going to have an album, I thought she would never make it because I heard she had a bad singing voice. She proved me wrong with ""If you had had my love"", and with ""No Me Ames"". Though I think Selena had a better voice, Jennifer's is not to bad! Her cd is ok, but she need to work on making the other songs on her album good, like ""if you had my love."""
4,GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I THINK THAT JENNIFER LOPEZ HAS THE TALENT TO SING BUT IN REALITY HER VOICE NEEDS MORE DEEPNESS, IT FEELS AS IF A 16 YEAR OLD IS SINGING THIS. SHE CAN DANCE BUT INSTEAD OF BEING LOOKED AS A SEX SYMBOL SHE CAN PORTRAY A BETTER IMAGE. SHE NEEDS TO START VALUING HER INSIDE IMAGE THAN HER OUTSIDE. SHE SEEMS TO HAVE TWO PERSONALITIES, WHICH SUCKS. BUT, IN THE OTHER SIDE SHE CAN ACT AND MOSTLY SING, SHE JUST NEEDS TO WORRY LESS ON HER PHYSIQUE. HER ALBUM IS OK"
3,JUST STICK 2 ACTING,ITS GOT PHAT BEATS ON MOST OF THE SONGS BUT THE GIRL CANT SING.THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THE ALBUM IS WITH MARC ANTHONY
2,I feel cheated!,"Before I even bought this CD, I had downloaded ""If you Had My Love"", from the net, and burned the mp3 onto a recordable-CD. I actually like that song. Why I actually went out and bought the whole ""stinking"" album, I'll never know. And, to think, there were no good shots of ""the part that counts"" in any of the album pictures. As if the lack of music wasn't bad enough! God help the people who are duped into buying this sick joke!"
3,"GOOD, But Not Good Enough","The lyrics, melodies and beats are real nice but her weak voice takes away from the catchy rythms of the songs. It was a nice attempt but she needs to leave singing to the pros like Britney or Christina. These girls are real singers and if you want good songs i recommend these albums instead of a mediocre actress that cant sing."
3,"JENNIFER GIVES IT HER ALL ,BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH?",ALL IN ALL I THINK JENNIFER'S ALBUM WAS OKAY. I REALLY WANTED HER ALBUM TO BE ALL LATIN. MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF KNOW JENNIFER FOR A LONG TIME AND KNEW SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH IN THE MUSIC SCENE. SHE MUST NEVER FORGET WHERE SHE CAME FROM BECAUSE WE ALL LOVE HER. WE DON'T WANT THIS STARDOM TO GO TO HER HEAD. SHE IS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE MODEL FOR ALL THE PUERTO RICANS!!!! PEACE
2,Lopez sings Spanish songs beautifully,"After having listened to this cd and seen Lopez's videos, I would have to say her best work is the love duet with Marc Antony ""No Me Ames."" I am an affecionado of Spanish music and find that Jennifer Lopez sings beautifully in Spanish but her voice doesn't cut it in English."
5,it has a seductive rythym,it has an up beat the the older crowds tha arein there 20s-30s and states a true fact about the song pertaining to life in general
5,"The best cd ever, Jennifer Lopez is incredibly talented","Jennifer Lopez cd is the best work in music ever. She is a hard worker and a very talented woman. She is also very sexy and an excellent actress. I would definetly buy this cd, and the maxi single import cd, the remixes rock."
3,Jenny from the block,"I own this album and all her others; jlo, j to tha lo the remixes and this is me then. This is my favorite and I personally don't think that she should have changed to what she is today, I preferred the Latin style she had."
3,ok debut cd,"I own this cd and although it is not that great, it isn't bad either. The best songs are the ones released as singles: If you had my love, Feelin' so Good, Let's get loud, Waiting for Tonight and No me Ames (balad version). The rest are mediocre, to say the least. If you're not a fan, buy the remix album. It's better and more dance oriented."
3,A SOLID DEBUT,"America has needed a Latin English diva for a long time. Many certainly thought we had one with Selena until she was sadly and unfortunately taken away. Jennifer Lopez kinda fills in the void. This disc is mainly R&B and Latin with a very small amount of Pop. The opening track which many know is IF YOU HAD MY LOVE which is a strong R&B track as well as radio single. WAITING FOR TONIGHT is like the only pop, dance song on the disc and is a recognizable hit. FEELIN SO GOOD is a very nice song that should brighten anyone's day. The ballads on the disc are not strong at all and the other songs except for a few like LET'S GET LOUD sound like filler. But this is a solid debut from a pretty talented singer."
2,Don't quit your day job Jennifer!,"Fortunately for Jennifer, she does great at her day job (acting). These songs just don't have the ""hit"" quality needed to compete (or stand shoulder to shoulder) with the caliber of female vocalists/performers out there. She sings with little conviction. I can bearly make out her voice in some of the tracks and the music seemed monotonous at times. Maybe next time Jennifer."
4,Great first CD....,I did not know what to expect when getting this CD. I was very happy with it. There is a good mix of songs and is enjoyable to listen to. I would not say it is my fav CD of all time but I like it.
2,One-Hit Wonder,"Jennifer Lopez is another one-hit wonder for the glitz-n-glamour but no substance 90's. On this so-called ""latin jazz"" or some crap like that album, there are only 2 good songs: the infectious hit single ""If You Had My Love,"" a rich R&B-salsa song and the slightly above-average ""Let's Get Loud."" The rest is mindless, horrible filler. Buy the single, not the CD."
2,Pretty Bad,This CD is pretty week. She sounds like a gloria estefan/selena wanna be. the words and rythmes of her songs are kind of lame and i was completly dissappointed. Atleast she has her gorgeous looks to fall back on.
5,She is The Best Female Singer in the World!,I think Jennifer Lopez's cd is awesome and she is soooooo fine
1,ANOTHER ACTOR DECIDES THAT SHE CAN SING,"THE STATE OF MUSIC IN AMERICA IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST LOPEZ,BUT THEIR ARE SO MANY OTHER TALANTED LATIN MUSICIANS OUT THEIR THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYING THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND ARE STILL UNKNOWN. IF IT WAS NOT FOR HERE PRETTY FACE AND BODY SHE WOULD BE UNHEARD OF. PLEASE STICK TO BEING AN ACTOR. GIVE THE REAL MUSICANS A CHANCE.BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL BUY WHATEVER THEY HERE ON THE RADIO. SO I GUESS IT REALLY IS THE BIG RECORD LABLES FAULT FOR PUTTING STUFF LIKE THIS OUT.I HOPE ONE DAY WE WILL GET BACK TO PROMOTING GOOD MUSIC INSTEAD OF A PRETTY FACE."
3,Not what I had hoped,"I wanted to love this CD, I did. I love Latin music (especially Cuban lately) and Latin spirit and passion. And yes, after speaking time in Venezuala I also think they're damn attractive. I wanted to love this CD because I think Ms. Lopez is beautiful and not a bad movie star....I just didn't really like the CD. I'm much more into the salsa dance style than another CD with more ballads. Jennifer's voice is strong enough and she appears to have talent. The songs just don't do anything for her....or me."
2,WHAT A LOAD!,"J.L. was ""put-on"" for only obvious reasons which I don't need to get into. Yes, she is beautiful, but the girl plain and simply CANNOT SING!!!!!(though she can dance) The first time I heard her single on the radio I just started cracking up. The first thing she said was ""I won't take you cheating on me"" and you must agree when I say ""SPARE ME...PLAYED OUT, NEXT SUBJECT!!"" Last but not least she needs to come off it when she says she's been singing since she was little...Okay, maybe she has, but somebody lied to her when they said it was good!! P.S.The 2 stars is for the beats, not her so-called talent!!"
3,it's alright but not that great,"I'd say that some of these songs are worth listening to, especially the duet with Marc Anthony. Some of the songs are too repetitive though. But, if you want a decent blend of Latin hip-hop then I recommend buying this CD."
3,"nice, no more then that","the album is very R&B with little touch of pop,hip hip and latin music. relly soft songs."
1,Let's be pragmatic here,"OK. First of all. People here are giving reviews for the wrong reasons. Like, hey she's Puerto Rican, so am I..I think I'll give her 5 stars, or hey, she's really pretty..I give her 5 stars. Let's be real here. It has nothing to do with so called ""playa hating"" If she was fat, ugly, and had that same exact voice, people would say she sucked! She has NO TALENT IN THE VOCAL DEPARTMENT. If anyone wants to hear real talent, check out Whitney Houston's CD! And as far as comparing her to Madonna....give me a break! Madonna is Madonna, and she can get away with not having the greatest voice."
4,SHE IS GREAT,"I DO NOT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. SHE IS A FAR BETTER SINGER THAN BRITNEY SPEARS, AND SHE LOOKS AND DANCES FAR BETTEER THAN HER. HER ALBUM IS THE BOMB. ESPECIALLY, ""WAITING FOR TONIGHT,"" ""IF YOU HAD MY LOVE,"" ""FEELING SO GOOD,"" AND ""LETS GET LOUD."" I FOUND THE CD TO BE EXTREMELY WELL DONE. I LISTEN TO IT EVERY DAY AND AM NOT SICK OF IT. I GOT CHRISTINA AGUILERA LAST WEEK AND CANT STAND IT ANYMORE. I THINK JENNIFER IS VERY, VERY TALENTED IN MANY WAYS. I THINK THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE BOUGHT ALL YEAR. CONGRATULATIONS JENNIFER FOR MAKING A GREAT ALBUM. EVERYONE WHO DOWNPLAYS HER ALBUM IS JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE THEY DONT EVEN HAVE 1/10 OF HER TALENT.ITS A GREAT ALBUM, GO GET IT AND YOU'LL SEE."
2,This cd is not good at all!,The only song I liked on the cd was No Me Ames. Don't buy this cd.I borrowed it.Iam glad I didn't buy it.
3,On the 6 is really cool,"I really Love Jennifer Lopez. She has great songs on the album and she does have a great voice. My favorites are ""Waiting for Tonight"" ""If you had my love"" and ""Feelin' so good"". The other songs are pretty good 2. I would definitly recomend this album. I still feel that Britney Spears is a lot better and so is Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey."
3,"A Nice Start, Though One Of Jennifer's Worse Albums","Jennifer Lopez - On The 6 (her first album)The songs from On The 6 certainly gave Jennifer a brighter future. She's went on to sell millions worldwide, and achieve platinum certifications. The first single from the album, If you had my love, also Jen's debut single, even achieved number one. The other two singles, Waiting for tonight and Feelin' so good are also nice. Most of the first half of the album is great, it's when you get to the second half you start to skip tracks. The best songs are It's not that serious, Baila, If you had my love, and Waiting for tonight, though I find myself skipping certain songs: Open Off My Love, Talk about us, Promise me you'll try and Do you know where you're going to. They are rather boring. So yeah, this album is 50:50. Jen's voice is also poor quality on some songs."
5,Jennifer lopez,"I think Jennifer lopez""s song is so cool. If you had my love music was so creative. She looked real good in it. When I listen to her song, it makes me want to get up and dance. I'm going to be the first one to buy it when it comes out! You go jennifer lopez"
2,Trying to find talent????? PLEASE!!,First I would like to start off saying that Jennifer is very beautiful but she should stick to acting. I heard some songs on the radio and some on the net and can we say no skills. Her voice is basically computerized everytime she tried to hit a high pitch and she sucks. The only reason I gave her two stars is because of the song she does with Marc Anthony which I have to admit is quite catchy. If you want my advice get Marc Anthony's cd instead Now there's real talent. But if you still have your doubt go on... buy the album you'll see she sounds like a screming cat!!!
2,"Borderline, and Barely Worth the Bother.","Middling debut album with only a few tracks worth the bother. ""If You Had My Love"" is a pleasant tune from Rodney Jerkins and ""Waiting for Tonight"" is a highly energetic disco stomper that makes the best use of Lopez's barely-there voice. It's pretty much downhill from there. ""Let's Talk About Us"" is Babyface redux and ""Let's Get Loud"" sounds forced. And, please, should she ever feel the need to do a duet, don't let it be with someone as vocally talented as Marc Anthony. Anthony's powerful voice only dwarfs Lopez's and, thusly, does far more harm than good. This record may have been a million seller, but credit that to her image and attitude. The music on this album, though not disastrous, is merely an afterthought."
2,She's A Much Better Actress!!!!!,"Jennifer Lopez is a great actress and I loved her in ""Anaconda."" Unfortunately, acting is where her talent stops, atleast in the entertainment business. I don't like her music, and I don't see how she's so successful now. Maybe it's because of her career as an actress? She definitely should keep her acting job, because she's just not cut out to be a singer. However, as long as she's climbing the charts and making money, maybe she should continue?"
1,Good try but I won't buy,"I didn't like this album at all and wouldn't consider wasting any money on it I like R&b but did not find anything likable about this album, I think this album is about as good as the movie Selena, which isin't saying much."
5,IT'S EXCELLENT!,"I love the CD. I got it yesterday. The best songs from the album are ""If You Had My Love"" which most people know. I also love ""No Me Ames"" which is her duet with Marc Anthony. It's also a great song. She's got an excellent voice and I think that she has achieved what she wanted to achieve with this CD, which is to be known as a singer also. Ever since Selena this girl has been surprising us."
1,"Jennifer, honey, stick to acting!","I'm sorry but that song ""If you had my love"" was way to long and boring. If she wants to dance she should go to Broadway and if she wants a shower she needs to go home. The video basically said the same thing the song did. . . nothing. In the song she said the same thing over and over! It got old fast. I think she's gonna be a one hit wonder. To be on the safe side she needs to stick with acting."
5,she is very talented!,I THINK SHE IS VERY COOL. AND ANY OF YOU GUYS THAT GAVE HER LESS THEN 4 STARS NEED TO OPEN YOUR EYES. SHE IS VERY GOOD AT BOTH SINGING AND ACTING! SO SHUT-UP.
1,"Oh My, what happened here!?!? Basura, basura, basura!","She cant sing worth her life. First of all I wont take you cheating on meeeaeasuughhhhhh! Can not hit anything, her live performances are horrible. No Me Ames is a classic, but only a real listener can tell that all of her real high notes are sung with Marc Anthony because it is easier to mask it! Ay, Ay, Ay, chica, que clase de basura has creado! No es musica, es basura!"
4,She sounds as good as she looks! ^_^,"The beauteous Jennifer Lopez broke into showbiz as a dancer on TV's In Living Color and established herself as an actress in Selena and Out of Sight. Now the Bronx-born Puerto Rican sex symbol has added pop singer to her already impressive résumé. With a little help from hit-maker friends like producer Emilio Estefan Jr. and salsa singer Marc Anthony, On the 6 (the title refers to a New York City subway line) offers a seamless blend of hip hop, pop, soul, dance and Latin genres. Though her voice is a bit thin, Lopez has definite flair and musicality. Her talent, combined with the CD's taut, energetic sound, makes On the 6 a ride worth taking."
4,JENNIFER LOPEZ IS JUST THE BEST,Jennifer Lopez disc is great. The best song is IF YOU HAD MY LOVE. Waiting for tonight is the english version of Una noche mas.Amar es para siempre is for the people that fell in love.No me ames with Marc Anthony is pretty.Should've never is good and very romanyic. Es amor is beautiful in the words.We can't forget Let's get loud a party song. Too late is good at the same than Is not that serious.El deseo de tu amor is in Mexico the latin version of Open off my love. Talk about us and Could this be love are great and slow.These two are very romantic. Promise me you'll try is the english version of Amar es para siempre. With this information we know yhat JENNIFER LOPEZ IS JUST THE BEST.
3,Jennifer Lopez is not the best,"First of all her voice is not that great. Her voice on a scale of 1 through 5 is a two. Her voice is not as bad as Enrique Inglesias, but not nearly as good as Shakira. Her music is not great dance music. If you want good beats get Fey. Want a good voice get Shakira. Want good Spanish music get Olga Tanon. If you want music to relax to get Jennifer Lopez."
1,Terrible C.D.!,"I hate having the same first name as Jennifer Lopez! Her music is awful! This C.D. is awful! Don't buy it; it is a waste of money!Also, I hate Jennifer Lopez as a person. She grew up poor, yet she never gives any aid to poor people. She doesn't care about anything but money.(...)"
1,Not worth the Money..,"It's not worth it. I for one, don't like Jennifer Lopez, not even her acting. That's another story. I though I'd give her a chance and listened to it..The beats on SOME songs are not bad. You hear more ""Puff"" stuff than her, plain and simple she can't sing.She sounds like she's really ""trying"" to hold a note. DON""T WASTE YOUR $"
1,whatever.......,"she can sing? nah...i've heard better. she really does try and i give her credit but she doesn't carry the vocals well at all...the only two songs that are really ok to listen to is ""Waiting for Tonight"" and ""If You Had My Love"" which ironically is the only 2 that plays over and over and over on the radio to the point you can actually say her songs are not the best. I don't think she did well as an actress (except selena, she did a great job there)either now not the singing department. It's like she's trying too hard guys."
5,The debut that started it all!,"In 1999, an incredible thing happened in the world of music. Jennifer Lopez releases her sensational debut, ""On the Six,"" which went multiplatinum and scored tons of hits like ""If You Had My Love,"" ""Waiting for Tonight,"" and ""Let's Get Loud."" This CD was released at the time she was dating Puff Daddy, and they made such a lovely couple. Oh, you really need to get this CD. It is absolutely urgent that you do so."
5,on the 6,"i think that jennifer is the best female singers out there she can dance, sing and she looks great, when i hear waiting for tonight i want to run right out to the club and get my dance on. my rating on this cd and jennifer is a 11.i hope she comes out with something new real soon."
2,Her singing is ok at the most...,"Personally, I think she's much better as an actress than as a singer. I mean everytime I listen to her sing, she reminds me that she is no Mariah or Whitney! Her voice isn't that solid compared to other singers!"
3,Good at acting bad at singing,this was a good album to me if someone else had sung it and wrote it it wouldve been maybe a grammy nom but thats not the case here jennifer cannot sing at all but she can act and dance dont hate cause shes LAtina!
2,Hated it.,On the 6 was realy bad. Shehas a great voice. But shestunk bad on this one. Sheis lucky to get 2 star's.Bt one song was ok. Ohyeah my wife said to addthis. She sing's greatbut dresses like a dog.
1,SLEEP AROUND TO MAKE IT IT'S WHAT YOUR GOOD AT,I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HER AT FIRST CAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WAS TRYING TO BE LIKE MY GIRL MARIAH . BUT SHE WASN'T I RESPECTED HER FOR GETTING MARRIED AND FELT BAD WHEN HER HUSBAND LEFT HER.BUT NOW I AM UPSET SHE USES HER BODY TO GET HER BY IN LIFE AND THAT WILL NEVER TURLY GET YOU ANY WHERE .I THINK SHE IS THE CAUSE OF PUFFY'S BREAKUP WITH HIS LATEST BABY'S MOTHER HE HAS 2 CHILDEREN AND HE NEEDS TO GET BACK ON THE WRITE TRACK. I HOPE YOUR NOT SLEEPING WITH HIM CAUSE IF YOU ARE YOU HAVE GONE REAL LOW YOUR NOT SELENA AND ALL OF US HISPANICS LOVED HER AT LEAST SHE HAD DIGNAITY.JENNIFER YOU ARE NO LONGER MY # 1 SINGER YOUR ALBUM IS FLAT YOUR VOICE IS BARLEY MAKIN IT .JUST STICK TO SHOWING YOU BODY AND SLEEPING WITH MEN TO GET YOU TO THE TOP SINCE THATS WHAT YOU ARE GOOD AT.
3,J-Lo,"Um, speak for yourself, Kenny. I'm from the Bronx and many of of wish she WEREN'T from here. She's a phoney and an embarassment to both Puerto Ricans and Bronxites alike. Her singing is ok. Her material is better than most these days. I'll give her that."
1,"Pretty good actress, but horrible singer and dancer","I am a big movie fan and I think Jennifer has a lot of talent in that. Being hispanic myself, I recognize that and support her acting. Even though since she did ""Selena"" her ego went straight through the roof!! As far as singing goes, she should think twice and stop now before she humiliates herself. As I recall in an interview where she criticized several actresses, including the even more talented Salma Hayek. She said that they were no good and should not spit on her profession. I think someone should stand up and tell her not to do the same (not spit on their profession, singing) By the way who taught her those awful steps she dances on the video ""If you had my love""?"
4,An very good debut CD...,"All in all I give Jennifer her props. She is a diva and has just taken it into a whole new genre. Although her voice is not dynamic, it is very suitable and capable to the material she has chosen to sing. She shines at her best on songs such as ""If You Had My Love"", ""Let's Get Loud"" and ""Feelin' So Good"". It is a very strong debut CD with stellar producers. Kudos to Ms. Lopez for proving that she can do it all and do it well. Move over young wannabe starlets, Miss Lopez is on the scene and she is ready to stake her grounds."
1,Just Act Girl!,"Either you CAN sing or you CANNOT sing...this girl CANNOT sing (even with all the reverb and audio airbrushing)....in a world with Gloria Estefan, etc...WHY would someone want to listen to this CD??? sorry jennifer....enjoy your movies though...."
1,A little disappointed...,I haven't had an opportunity to listen to the CD which is why I came to this page - now I am really wondering how good or bad her voice is being that none of the songs are listed to listen to. I saw her weak performance on Letterman and her lip-synched performance on the Blockbuster Awards - We all must remember how Madonna started out - she to used to lipsynch her performances and concerts but developed her voice - hopefully Jennifer will too - maybe then I will invest in a CD that shows her true vocal talents.
2,Just buy the single,"Don't waste your money buying the whole CD. ""If You had my Love"" is a great song, so just buy it. If they would've spent as much time on the songs as they did on the pics inside, it would be great. I don't think that she has alot of talent, she just sounds good with all of the backup singers."
2,an actress with a big mouth( & in need of some practice,"I think Jennifer was a good actress in many of her movies especially Out of Sight however her music isnt ""all that"".. I havent seen her act on the lettermen show like many of others have but I could just imagine...it seems like her ego has skyrocketed and that she prefers to talk about others and then when she gets heat for it she retracts...the two songs i have heard ""No Me Ames"" and ""If U Had My Love"" are pretty good but the reason they are good isnt necessarily because of her musical talents."
4,"Great beginning for Lopez - ""Let's Get Loud"" is incredible.","Jennifer's debut cd shows the potential she has as a singer. Songs such as ""If You Had My Love"", ""Let's Get Loud"", ""No Me Ames"" and ""Waiting For Tonight"" will definitely put her on the map. This cd has something for everyone. Hopefully, her future recordings will continue to showcase Latin/Dance music."
1,Oh Jennifer...,"Jennifer Lopez is a smart girl and she knew that putting a yummy picture of her on the cover of the cd would certainly get people to buy it. Well that picture must have blinded many listeners to the music inside. Lopez may be a good actress, with a great body, she may even be smart, but a singer she is not. It's a catchy album, sure, but actually good? does she sing with actual talent? Nope. With all the backup singers, with the all-star producers, whenever Lopez is called upon to sing, she can barely stay on key much less add any personality."
2,Very good but needs work,"If any of you are considering purchasing this CD, I would like to establish some credentials and main reasons. The words and voice itself are terrible in certain areas with perpetual rhytms and ptch variations such as ""Waiting For Tonite""....Her music is good and if she worried less about her body and in espanol her ""moda y arreglo"" Then her music would be great and less of a MTV song perfect for videos showing much. She should look into being an actress for not just regular movies. Great stuff Jennifer, you go girlfriend"
4,Fun - Upbeat CD,"I really liked this CD. I know the other reviewers felt like Jennifer Lopez was a poor imitation of Selena, but Jennifer isn't trying to be Selena - She's just trying to do her own thing. This CD is really upbeat, and has good lyrics to it. If you're a fan of pop music - go ahead and buy this one."
1,NO VOICE,"I don't know who in the world told this chic that she could sing. This CD has a few catchy tunes but they would sound alot better in the voice of someone who could really sing. The duet with Marc Anthony ""No me ames"" was the only good song and only thanks to him. You don't even hear her voice in that song because Marc Anthony's is so powerful that it drowns her voice. Marc must really like her to have done her the favor. He should do her another favor and teach her how to sing. I like Jennifer, I think she is a representation of Latina women but she should really stick to acting because she cannot sing a note."
2,I'm not too sure about this one.....,"I was really looking forward to this one, i was quite dissapointed. The songs 'If you had my love, 'Waiting for tonight' and 'Let's get loud' are good. But the rest of the album is basically furball love songs which you should be prepared to choke on, don't even buy this album even if you ADORE love songs, as these are BAD love songs. Just buy the singles instead, or tape it off someone who was unfortuanate enough to buy it. Actually there is two extra songs on the British version, 'baila' and 'Do you know where you're going to'. Baila was quite good but, BUT, the theme from mahogany was quite frankly slaughtered by Jennifer introducing latin instruments and whiny singing, euuuurrrgghhh!"
3,Not a bad debut,"Not all the songs are superb, nor is the quality of Jen's voice consistently astounding but what she has delivered is a sound package containing enough potential hit singles to make her appealing, and to prove that she is a versatile and talented entertainer - of which there is no doubt. The two single are great but stand out track has to be ''Let's Get Loud'' a typically Estefanish uptempo maraca affair which really gets the toes tapping, and deserves to be a mega hit for her and prove that Gloria Estefan is still top of her field. Let's just hope Jen continues to make songs like that well into the future and she will guarantee herself longevity beyond the bright lights of Hollywood"
3,NOT BAD AT ALL . . . FOR HER FIRST ATTEMPT,"This is not the best CD I've heard, but, it is not the worst and it is certainly better than most. I enjoyed 'Waiting For Tonight' because I like to dance. There are, for that reason, other tracks on this CD I also enjoyed. However, don't take my word for it. One man's treasure is another man's trash. I believe artistic value reflects individual taste only. If you enjoy Jennifer Lopez, then buy it. If you're not sure or have never heard any of the songs on this CD, download a portion of it or borrow the CD from a friend. If you like it, the it IS of artistic value and you should go ahead and buy it. My suggestion is even if you only like one track, go ahead and by it. Who knows what other of her songs you may grow into. Whatever the case, if you enjoy dance tracks, then I recommend this CD."
2,"Did her ""voice"" get flattened by the 6?","Jennifer Lopez should stick to the acting. This girl can not sing a beat. Sometimes she makes a half-hearted attempt to sound good, but usually not. The 3 singles are pretty good, but nothing really spectacular. The best song on here is ""No Me Ames"", the duet with Marc Anthony. Marc has the most singing in the song, but his tremendous voice sort of inspires Jennifer to turn in a good performance. The only other good song on the CD is ""Promise Me You'll Try"", a soft ballad that is pretty good. If she wants to act, let her. But she really needs to cut out the singing. If you want real music, try Britney, Marc Anthony, or Mandy Moore. They surely will not disappoint."
3,"""If You Had My Love"" Is Cool....But Rest Kinda Dissapointing","I love the single ""If You Had My Love"" but I'm not so sure that Jennifer Lopez will have a long music career. I personally think she's a better actress then a singer. And although I really appreicate her, I don't think she can sing any high notes. I am not trying to critize her or anything, I'm just saying what I believe. I think she should stick to acting. The thing you should buy of her is ""Selena""-the video. She did a really good job in that and that is why I think she should stick to the acting thing. But if you really like Jennifer Lopez, then I see no reason why you shouldn't buy this CD-it is kinda worth it."
2,Purchase the single and save yourself some money,"I loved the single ""If You had my Love"", but the rest of the CD is dissappointing. Ms. Lopez's voice has no range or power. Sometimes artists can compensate by having great material, a catchy beat or a great producer. Unfortunately On the 6 has none of the above going for it. Although ""Let's Get Loud"" was a decent effort. I was hoping for more - - maybe next time."
3,Songs are relatable....but voice doesn't convince,"I admit....I really enjoyed ""If You Had My Love"" because of the fast tempo...latino mix....but Jennifer just doesn't convince me that she has a strong voice. Acting (Great) Dancing (Great)... but her singing would not be on the ""A"" list. The lyrics are wonderful...but somehow...her voice is too weak. Celine Dion would've been a better choice for this album. Hopefully, with vocal lessons and more training...she will improve. Everyone needs a chance! (And she just used up one.) Personally; there just has been too much hype about her...I think if it wasn't for her popularity...she never would've gotten a record deal....passing with the voice she has now."
1,Good try but better luck next time,"Two words: Studio Star. Its a real shame that anyone can cut an album these days with minimal singing skills. Not to downplay her acting talents but she is an entertainer and not a singer. Her backup singers do more singing than her. All her ""singing"" is a result of mixing by sound technicians. In fact, I once took a terrible sounding tape from a friend, remixed it and he sounded great."
3,I Like It,"I didn't expect anything groundbreaking when I bought this CD, but for what it is, it's actually pretty good. She's certainly better than those neophytes, Brittney and Christina, but she's still no Madonna."
1,I guess if your already famous anything is possible!,"This album is so bad, I do not recommend anyone to listen to it! I was very dissapointed especially with ""Waiting For Tonight"", Its poorly arranged, anyway if she was not known from other things already this album would never have had the popularity it did. Her voice is worse than mine in the shower. Oh another bad song on the album is a duet with Marc Anthony the lyrics are dopey and the whole thing is bad, bad, bad!!! at my next garage sale I will try to get rid of it."
3,There were only a few good songs on this CD,She is better as an actress as she is as singer There were about three songs on this CD that i enjoyed. I think that it's OK if you dont mind only listening to a few songss on the CD
5,Hmm...,"Quite amusing. 1 star reviews...5 star reviews...very interesting indeed.On a whole, the majority of songs and tunes on this album are memorable and fresh, therefore I give out 5 stars, not to Jennifer Lopez herself (which many people have done) but the ALBUM.(People, please remember what you're reviewing here)"
5,This Cd rocks!!!!!!,"This is an awesome CD, She's got the voice the looks and theDance moves, which make her music videos awesome!!!!! Keep on goingJennifer!!!!!!!"
4,quick service,The seller did a great job describing and displaying the hymn book. It is the one from my childhood church. A friend wanted it and it was sent quickly. It was also a decent price.
5,Perfect Christmas present,"My husband and I got 2 new puppies this year, so this year we got this ornament and the Hug ornament to represent us with our 2 puppies! They're perfect!"
1,Beware of compatibility problems,"Warning: This game was fun until it produced the dreaded ""This program has performed an illegal operation..."" and aborted. Puzz3D's support technician had no answers. Other 3D games run fine, only this one is unplayable. (My OS is Win98)."
2,Game Discontinued,"Despite previous reviews stating that there was a problem with the program requiring a patch, I purchased the program to play with my kids. At the easiest level it took us some time to get the hang of the game but eventually we completed building the mansion. Once we tried to enter the mansion however, the program closed citing ""illegal operation"". I attempted to get the patch from Wrebbit only to find that it has been purchased by Hasbro, and Hasbro will provide no support as the game is discontinued. Hasbro will provide Wrebbit's phone number in Canada, but when contacted by telephone, Wrebbit customer service sends customers to a website that no longer exists (and they know it), claiming there are no other options. A major disappointment all around."
1,Not worth the effort,I really enjoyed this game until I completed the first level and could not continue. I kept receiving an error message and the game would shut down. I ended up wasting money on a game that I can no longer play. I would like to say that if there is a chance of this happening to anyone else I would advice them not to purchase this game. Finishing the first level isn't worth the price of the game.
5,Victorian Mansion,"The first of the 3-d puzzles I purchased. I am now addicted. Great graphics, lots of hours of fun. I didn't even get into solving the mystery yet, as I enjoyed putting the puzzle together. Even after I finished the last level, I went back and put the puzzle together again and again. I ordered the Bavarian Castle and working on it now. I will be ordering the Notre Dame soon."
4,Addictive!,"I bought this game because I enjoy computer games and don't have a place to set up a traditional jigsaw puzzle. Now I'm hooked! The interface was easy to use. However, I didn't like the tray sorting system. If you're trigger happy with the mouse, your trays end up getting combined or dumped pretty easily. I ended up not using it. I was concerned that the exploration part would be kind of skimpy but was pleasantly surprised. There are more puzzles once you're inside the mansion as well as the mystery to solve. The graphics were very good. It was also neat to see the mansion from the inside and be able to identify features that you put together in the puzzle segment of the game. The attention to detail was great. I can't wait to do the Castle and Notre Dame!"
4,Addictive!,Working a computerized puzzle was surprisingly realistic for me. It satisfied that puzzle-solving urge without disrupting my house for a week! I was disappointed in the tray sorting system. I found it rather touchy. My trays keep getting either dumped or combined. I was pleasantly surprised by the exploration phase of the game. It was much more detailed than I expected. There are additional puzzles once you're inside as well as the murder mystery. You do actually feel like you're inside when you look out the windows you just put together! The graphics are very good. I'm anxious to start working the other puzzles.
3,This was good 7 years ago,"Graphic Design School has some useful tools for beginners, but more than half of the book is outdated. Graphic Design School has a few sections on design theory, and more than half the book are tutorials in photoshop, illustrator, etc.The book boasts a bit how today you cannot talk about or teach graphic desing without addressing technology, This is where the book faulters. Technology tchanges so quickly now that this book's many tutorials end up being very obsolete (pre adobe CS). It would have been nice if this came with a CD that could get updates for tutorials, etc. A book like this needs to make a new edition atleast every 2 years to keep up."
2,Its the ADHD book of Design,"This book has plenty of great information in it. BUT, I refer to it as the ADHD book because it is all over the map. In the span of 4 pages it might hit on 12 different topics. The book is fine to pick up and read a page or two here and there, but as a textbook I find it is very difficult to teach from. Its just too scattered."
5,Graphic Design book review,This is an excellent book on design and I would recommend it to everyone. This book was used in one of my graduate classes.
4,More of an overview than a school ....,"I really enjoyed this book, but I wouldn't say that it actually teaches you the 'how to's' of graphic design. On the other hand the book is fantastic at showing real-life examples as well as all of the many applications of graphic design which assists one to decide which path to focus on."
2,A must!? I don't think so.,"Yes the book is visual. Yes it has examples of other student's work. Yes there is helpful information in it.HOWEVER, having worked in the field for more than 10 years, I find this book simplistic, and frankly the samples of work included are not very good.Why would I want to emulate design I don't like?I found the examples to be dated, and I found the book lacking in teaching skills that designers really need to know.If this is a fair representation of what is being taught in design school, we are in a very sad place.There are so many other GOOD books out there. Buy one of those."
4,New Graphic Design School,"Loaded with illustrations, graphics and layouts, this intoduction to graphic design covers basics that will ""charge"" your creative batteries."
3,kindle book,I couldn't read it on my older kindle reader and could only use cloud because of it being photo copied from the original book.
5,Very Good Read-Siringo is Colorful,"Good service and timely arrival. Enjoyable book, seems to be accurate. Very satisfied. Author seems to be knowledgeable and makes it interesting."
2,Not to keen on this,"Was not to keen on this movie. It did nothing for me, and it is one that I will never watch again. I actually thought it was pretty dumb. Just not my taste"
4,Holds true to the story of the novel,This movie offers a wonderful depiction of the Indian Culture and what it means to be stuck being and American and an immigrant.
2,Book is much better!,The book is much better. It helps to read the book BEFORE you see the movie. My husband didn't read the book and was confused about some of the situations in the movie.
2,Sorry.... not so good!!,"Such a great idea for a movie, such a powerfull subject and not to mention an amazing trailer, and still, the movie wassn't really good. Skip this one"
3,Good Unknown Film,"This movie is a great film from this year, but not really a buy unless you love the story enough to watch it over again."
1,Subtitle,The subtitles do not match what the actors are actually saying. I would like to return this DVD. Please advise
3,I expected more,"This is an interesting film and I heard nothing but rave reviews for the novel-so of course when I learned they had already turned this into a film I decided to check it out. At the final credits I found myself thinking--""Is that all?"" I don't know, I was hoping to be touched on a more deeper level and I just never really got there. It's a decent film, but by no means memorable."
4,Read the book first!,"I read the book first and then watched the movie. The story is great, but the book contains so much that the movie left out. Throughout the movie, I kept having to explain to my husband what was happening based on what I remembered based on the book. I think it's still worth watching, just read the book first!"
5,great!,"Excellent film. Film covers culture, identity, and parental relationships. Deals truthfully with what it is like to be a person of color growing up in a white world and how many come to terms with ones culture/identity. Excellent tasteful film."
3,Love is in your heart,AT first I thougt that it had no point except to show America in a bad view but as time went on it surely had many points of view. Many good points of view. As an American woman married to an Indian man with four sons we were glad to see that love is most important. No one culture is better then another and that even thought we all wish our children to marry into our cultures whats is more important is their happiness and their respect for us their parents. Happiness is a gift. Each person will take what they need from this movie our family being mixed chose to see it as a good film with good views full circle.
4,Great Movie!!,"I had to watch this movie for a class and someone referred me to Amazon.com for a last minute review. The movie quality was great, and the film is a very great movie!! I didn't know Amazon had this option, very cheap way to watch movies! You can use your HDMi cord to stream it onto your TV. I really enjoyed the themes in this film, it brought me to tears a few times."
3,good moral movie,It was a good story about remembering who you are and where you come from. It shows you to appreciate your family too.
2,Name sake,I am unable to play this on my dvd player because it is for another zone not european so disapointed.This one of 4 dvds I have experienced the same problem.
5,A Powerful Flick,"""The Namesake"" is an excellent movie that demonstrates cultural and racial differences in a non-biased way. There are many lessons to be learned throughout the storyline, and the acting is superb. If you want to think about how diverse a people we are, this movie should be on your to-view list. It's educational without being preach-y. It's a lesson without being in the classroom."
1,A Thai Woman's Response,I find this book disgusting. The mere fact that the author has simply glossed over the detrimental effects that prostitution has and is having on Thai women and society is completely unjustified. Books like these encourage people to take on a shallow understanding of these layered problems.The author knows NOTHING about Thai women.
5,"Oh, yeah!!","Yep, this is the book that tells it like it is. Great photographs and well researched text. If you are about to leave for Thailand, better get this first. It is a real eye-opener! Love the first section the best but the go go dancers sure are cute especially the ones who smacked into each other and one got a bloody nose. Great stuff! Great women!"
1,Shame,"...Whether or not it was intended as such it is a commercial for prostitution in a poor country where many of the women involved are no older than 13 or 14, effectively ""slaves,"" raise their own children in brothels and end up destroying their lives either through alcohol/drug abuse or through AIDS.Don't think for a moment that just because YOU slept with a clean bargirl you aren't part of the process - its all wrapped up together.Don't glorify this world. If Dean Barrett had the tinest bit of genuine respect for the women of Thailand he would fight to put an end to sex tourism and prostitution in Thailand - not promote it."
5,A Long Overdue Book,"This is a long overdue book that tells it like it is. The author is interested in probing as to why men from around the world in particular love Thai women. He does a fine job of answering the question both in photographs and in text. He discusses their personalities and how they love to laugh. You want to sit around and babble mindlessly about ""relationships"" stay in the West. You want a woman to have some fun with and one who knows how to enjoy life, go to Thailand. The girls are great and the text is very informative. Glad I spotted this on-line. For men tired of the BS in America, this book is a wake-up call, and as such you can be sure feminazis will hate it and try to put both Thai women and men who love them down. Let them do their worst, I'll be back in LOS (Land of Smiles) soon!"
2,Yawn. Just sounds like typical white-guy rationalizations for,"preferring women who prefer HIM, and any ""oh-so-handsome"" Western men like him. Wouldn't you too be smitten if a certain type of woman seems to fawn all over you and your kind? And then he has to write a book all about them? And yeah, the woman on the cover does look like a katoey.If you read all the reviews here, you begin to notice a common thread amongst a number of the reviewers: disdain for ""feminists"" and ""Western women"". Men such as these like to throw these terms around as ""insults"". Well, this feminist, western woman isn't bothered at all by your ""preference"". To me, it just speaks volumes about the particular reviewers."
5,Great Introduction,"This book is a great introduction to the women of the Land of Smiles. 160 pages of photographs and lots of text. Of course, I've been to Bangkok a number of times so I might point out that as great as the women look in the book they are even better in person, up close and personal.But what I really like is the often witty and well reasoned discussion of why men are crazy about Thai girls and why western girls get so upset about the situation. Like the author says, everybody has his or her own spin to put on the situation. Charming and beautiful, yeah, but if you marry a country girl best to keep her ikn the Thai countryside. Not try to westernize her. It won't take and it will just cause trouble. In other words, don't be afraid to live in Thailand and get a bit involved in the culture. The more you know about Thailand, the molre chance of having a great relationship with a thai woman. Anyway, that's my two baht worth. I think this great book will open a few eyes."
3,Wasn't really what I expected,"This book is simply a photograph book with very little text and insight. Most pictures have extended captions, but still offer very little. I mean, the expectation was that it would show off the most beautiful women of Thailand in various situations. Although it fills the latter, the women do not show off the country's best. I realize he was trying to show the beauty of the rice worker, etc, but I was dissapointed to see the same women in 4,5 or more photos. I think the allure is with the photos of the go-go girls, and although erotic, don't get it for this reason alone. The text on the go-go world is interesting, but I have read tons more simply off the web."
1,Fugly men need love too,"I don't get it - this is a book supposed to be representative of women who are the most beautiful - and the cover picture looks like a sex change case from Johns Hopkins. The other pictures are a real dissapointment, most are amateurish and representative of typical expat pap.The men who frequent Thailand are some of the most repulsive I've ever seen - Patpong road looks like some sort of 24/7 Ugly Man Festival. These women are so poor that they have to sleep with these guys to make money. I don't envy them. Thai women are not only attractive, they are some of the bravest women on earth, and I salute them."
4,Useful for someone who has had a college course in electronics,"I had a university course in electronics and, many years later, needed to go back and refresh my memory and learn more about transistors and simple transistor circuits. I found the sections on transistors here at a more basic level and more understandable than comparable sections of Horowitz and Hill.Chapters include:Amplification and the transistor; The field-effect transistor; Thermionic valves and the cathode-ray tube; Negative feedback; Impedance matching; Semiconductor device characteristics; Amplification at high frequencies; Low-frequency signals, d.c. and the differential amplifier; Power supplies and power control; Pulse handling and time constants; Integrated circuit building bricks; Positive feedback circuits and signal generators; Logic, counters and timers."
2,Worst story I have ever read,"In my family, we were brought up to enjoy reading. I always love to read books, even when they are assigned. I must say though, Fatheralong had to be the worst book I have ever read. The number one problem is that it does not stick to one thing at a time. It constanly jumps around and is extremly hard to follow. I did not enjoy the content either. Widman seems angry through out the book. He talks of people being racist, but some of his comments seem to be a bit prejediced toward people. The last thing that I thought was kind of ironic. The whole book was a letter to his son that was in prison. NParri"
2,Not quite the book I was expecting,"I didn't like the book very much. I was surprised to find out that I had to read it for an English 101 class. It brought out some controversial issues. I would have liked it better if I had read the ending first, then read the rest of the book!"
2,Too wordy and very confusing,"I found this book difficult to read from the very beginning. The setting jumped around too much to keep up with the story. After the first chapter I was already tired of Wideman's racist comments and his hipocrisy. I would not suggest this book to any of my friends. The only reason I read this book was because it was assigned for an English class. I figured I would give it a chance, but I never really had a high opinion of the book."
2,Really uncomfortable,"I was looking for a small, agile mouse. This v150 appeared to fit the bill. It is small, light and maneuverable but it is also very uncomfortable. I hold my mouse with my thumb and ring finger while my index finger and middle finger rest on the buttons. The tapering of the v150 makes holding the mouse this way very uncomfortable. The simple act of holding the mouse folds your hand in a awkward and unnatural position. If the mouse had no tapering I think it would be a fine product."
5,Much better than you'd expect,"I had gotten this for my laptop bag, but it somehow migrated to my desktop, where I've been using it for a year or so, and that means 8 hours a day or more. I swapped it back for a standard mouse, but found the bigger one was so heavy and stiff, I'm getting another one of these. I got used to just using my fingers with the smaller one, which gives great control with little wrist motion. Compared to an OEM-style mouse, it's about 75% of the size and weight, though with a narrower waist. The glide is very light and smooth. Build quality is good, with a positive clicks on the buttons. If I had any complaint it's that the scroll wheel used as a button is a little loud and and spins a tad too easily, but that's strictly personal preference for us 3-button users. As others have said, it does have a short cable, as you'd expect for a laptop mouse, but it is extremely flexible which is nice."
3,Good,"Good, easy to use... worth the price and is a reasonable bet... the question is its longevity..its a bit too small for people with big hands though. Will report again after longer usage."
3,Overall satisfaction,"even though its USB cable is very short and it's not mentioned in the item's page, the mouse grab is fantastic & the laser sensitivity also.It's a good mouse to purchase if you don't care about shorty cables."
2,It's really a small mouse,"My hands are not big compared with normal people but this mouse is really small. If you want to play games with a mouse, just ignore this one. Also, the cord is very short. If you are right-handed using your laptop, you must have your usb connected to the right side.Apart from above, I had this mouse for 9 months and then its left button stop working and I just could not make it back to work again, so I quit and go for a new mouse.I just want to say if you are not really devoted to getting a tiny mouse which might be convenient when you always use your laptop everywhere, forget about this one."
2,V150 Mouse has balky scroll wheel,"I took my brand new V150 laser mouse out of the package and plugged it into my laptop's USB port. As soon as I tried to use it, though, I encountered a problem. The scrollwheel is balky, meaning it grinds like it's missing a bearing. This is obviously unacceptable for a new product, so I'm returning it and will probably look for a different model so as not to have to waste any more time dealing with another bad unit."
3,cord,"The laser gives great tracking, the size is comfortable, and it's very compact. The cord is TOO SHORT. If your USB ports are on the wrong side good luck. The cord is like 18"" long. Your laptop is like 14"" wide. Make sire the ports are on the ride side or buy a cable extension."
3,scrolling issue,"Ok, I have windows 8 and am using this mouse. The scrolling is not working at all. I cannot scroll anywhere. Anyone else have the same problem with this mouse?It works with other OS's and other mice work with windows 8, but the this mouse/windows8 do not mix."
1,Logictech V150 Mouse,"Received promptly, works fine. I've found the life of these (used with a laptop) is about 2 years. I buy only Logitech, as I think they are the best.Update on 4/26/12: Downgraded from 5 stars to 1 star. This mouse is a disappointment. It is jumpy, and I often have to double click two or three times before it will do the job. I've had several Logictech mice over the years, but this may be my last."
2,"Weirdly ""jumpy"" mouse, unlike the Logitech M100 I had before","Earlier, I had a logitech M100 tilt-wheel optical mouse. However, when the ""tilt right"" button stopped worked, I needed a replacement. I ordered this mouse. It works sort of OK, but the cursor is somewhat ""jumpy"" instead of being smooth like with the M100. It's still *usable*, but it's a way less good mouse, and I will be ordering another brand soon. (Maybe I just got a bad one?)"
3,Cord is too short and the mouse is too small,The mouse works great but it is way too small even for a child. The cord is extremely short. I would not order this item again.
5,Recommended !,A good and practical read about the grayer areas of leadership -- particularly apt post Eron...but applicable all the time. As I have advanced in my own leadership position I find the choice between right and right...and I search for inspiration as well as advice I can use. I especially liked the chapter on the dark side...since we all have one !
5,Notre Dame,"The hardest of the Puzz3-d so far. The only I haven't tried is the Orient Express. The clues in this one are harder to find and decifer. Almost missed [a hidden part], and took forever to find the last clue. Great fun and hours of getting lost in Notre Dame. I'm hooked and can't wait to ride on the Orient Express. I hope these games keep coming."
3,A good Performances mixes with the boring one.,"As for a fault about this video which I point out, the dance being printed on the package is that it isn't being recorded in this video.It is a thunder-storm in the Riverdance. Some sets of teams in the video played a wonderful dance. I was almost satisfied. And, this sentence is being translated by the translation software. Forgive me for the poor sentence from Japan."
3,Crafty,"Although not a bad book, it addresses beginners and the jewelry is crafty for the most part. Perhaps including ""for beginner"" in the title would have given a better idea about the content."
3,Not what I thought it would be,"Although this book has a lot of good information in it, this type of book should be updated frequently in order to keep up with the times. Most web sites are no longer in exsistance, and a lot of them are not legitimate either. The book tells you never to pay for information or in order to gain employment, however, most sites or potential employers listed require just that."
2,Booooooring,Almost ALL of the web-sites recommended in this book are no longer working.AlsoThe book was BOING
5,great saw,"i bought this saw 4 months ago and have nothing but good things to say. At 395.00 there is no other bandsaw on the market that delivers grizzly's quality at that price. I considered buying a number of saws before picking the grizzly saw. It didn't make sense to buy a jet or delta for 500.00, when they don't have ball bearing blade guides nor quick tension release. I was concerned about the 1 hp motor but it turns out to be quite powerful. I would recommend this saw to any one."
5,This bandsaw rocks!,"I am not going to go over most of the positives that were mentioned numerous times by other reviewers. Here are some positive points not mentioned as often:1.) Fit and finish are excellent. And I love the ""Grizzly Green"" poweder coat metallic paint.2.) Packaging design is exceptional. The box obviously got bumped around a bit in transit, but the contents were perfectly protected.3.) Instruction manual was very clear. They even give you a chance to give them feedback to improve the manual.4.) I did have trouble with the delivery company. I called Grizzly to get it straightened out. They jumped all over themselves trying to make it right. Grizzly customer service is world class.5.) Technical support also is excellent. I have not needed them on this product, but have gotten clear, quick help from them on other products.In my opinion, you can not buy a better 14"" bandsaw for the money, and perhaps not for twice the price."
5,erashaf,This is a truly fine and rugged band saw. It replaces an old small three-wheel Craftsman saw that was always inadequate for many projects and also kept breaking blades because of the rather sharp diameter of the wheels. This Grizzly saw is a very well engineered and beautiful machine. I have been using it for a month now and I never want to stop my work on it once I get started. It is a true pleasure to finally work on good and adequate equipment.
1,"modest saw, mediocre price and poor customer service","Recieved saw and upon assembly found that the riser block kit was missing the guide tube, rendering the saw unusable for my purposes. So far I've made 3 calls to Grizzly customer support, spoken with 5 different people and have yet to recieve any commitment from Grizzly on either sending me the missing part, or returning the unit as defective. The technician who said he would call me back never did, nor did the customer service rep who made the same promise. The one manager that I've spoken to suggested that my only recourse was to write an email to customer service, which has gone unanswered. My pre-purchase research had lead me to expect *much* better customer service than this, perhaps their standards have fallen."
2,Great saw horrible shipping and customer service.,"While I love the saw, the shipping and customer service really set a poor foundation for the Grizzly name. When you pay for shipping one would expect it to be delivered to your door, not with Grizzly. You need to unload the package from the truck or opt for the warehouse pickup. Why would I opt for a warehouse pickup after paying +/-$80 for delivery. Add on an additional $30 to that and you can use the trucks lift gate to lower the item to the street."
1,Not Impressed,"I bought this saw after reading all the glowing reviews on the ""ultimate"" bandsaw, Grizzly G0555. What a joke. This saw comes from the factory with wheels out of line, with a blade the doesn't cut and a table that warps and fence that can't even be adjusted to within 1/64 of an inch. It vibrated so much that it almost ""walked"" around the shop. The 2 speeds are useless for my applications and the 3/4 hp motor on the Ridgid does a much better resawing job than the 1 HP on this turkey. The extension block is a nightmare to install and is really useless on wider lumber anyway. I returned this critter and just bit the bullet and bought the Jet. If you are a professional woodworker, I recommend that you pass on this saw. If you can't afford the Jet, buy the Ridgid. If the Ridgid doesn't meet your needs, it is an easy return at Home Depot. While it may be ok for the weekend wood butcher, It is no where near the quality of the Jet and no better that the $300 Ridgid."
1,alignment,"the blade on this saw simply will not stay on. even after hours of set up to make sure the thing is balanced and all guide wheels are correct, the blade comes off, binds on even the easiest things to cut. had better luck cutting things above 1in thick with my $100 craftsmen bandsaw if that says anything. currently have some 3/4in mdf hanging off the side of the table because the blade bound on a stright line cut, popped off, blade reset and motor cant turn the wheels. the motor may be rated at 3/4hp but with the belt slipping constantly it makes that power useless."
2,Buyer beware--more sizzle than steak here.,"I have the LX version, but it is the same saw with a few gee gaws to add to the sizzle. The paint job is nice, the stand is snazzy, and the roller bearings make you think you're getting a good value here. Buyer beware. The engineering on this is low end all the way. The roller bearing adjustment method/mechanism is K-mart-level and the bearings don't align flush with the blade, the lower bearings and trunion bolts are a real pain to get to, the table doesn't sit securely in the trunion, the table alignment process is mere wishful thinking and the fence installation instructions are blithely vague. If you want something that looks good, this is a great product. If you want solid engineering and a no-nonsense set up, look elsewhere. BTW, I've successfully set up radial arm saws, table saws, miter saws, etc., This takes the cake for mickey mouse engineering and a maddening set up procedure."
4,Nicely obscure,"This is actually pretty cool... many Bollywood compliations recycle the same old songs, but this one gives you some gems you most likely won't find anywhere else. It all sounds nostagically old & blends Indian classical influence with a bit of Western, but not nearly so much West as you get these days. You'll hear the stalwarts Asha and Lata plus some others who aren't very well known these days. This might not be a place to start if you've never heard the ""genre"" but it's definitely worth putting in your collection as you delve a bit deeper."
4,Walking Everyday With The Lord,"This book, written by one of the great men of God, is an everyday guide to walking with Jesus. This book offers insight on how to start your day, get through your day, and end your day focused on the Lord. Matthew Henry was a great man of God. This is a good look into his daily walk with the Lord."
5,Title says it all!,One of the very funniest comedies of all time! I do not think there was even one episode ever that I did not laugh at!
1,Trite show; stock characters; predictable plots,"The main characters are always the same:predictable stock characters with no dimensions. Frank is always the grumpy curmudgeon making insulting cracks about his wife; Marie is always the manipulative controller syrupy sweet manner. Robert is always Eeyore and jealous of Raymond. Raymond is a whiny ass little mama's boy in a vain search for his balls. The only interesting character is Debra, who is all over the map emotionally and wears many ""hats"" in the family from anchor in the storm to adorable sweetheart. I suspect the writing was always too dominated by Romano who probably refused to submit to anyone's advice but his own ego."
4,Possibly the last great sitcom,"Bravo to HBO video, for reducing the price of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" to the point where season box sets can be sold as two-packs. I first saw this at my local Target store. Got most of the seasons there, and seasons 3-4 here at Amazon, to further my collection. My seller did a fine job of getting it to me sooner than I expected. The condition was as good as promised, and the joy of both hearing commentaries, and seeing deleted scenes puts DVD ownership over the tube anytime. Even on my low-res TV, the quality is pristine, and the inclusion of a TV museum event where the cast and crew appeared is a bonus for anybody as interested in the creators of this show, as well as the actors. (Not since the Dick Van Dyke show, have I seen a show work the way ""Raymond"" did.) ILFT finishing my collection soon, with the wonderful season 7."
3,plants and the cherokee,"I chose this rating b/c I was hoping it was a book and not a DVD> if this product was a book I would really like it. If there is a way that I can trade it in for one, I would be open to that.Packaging great-no worries. haven't seen yet."
5,"Fresh, funny and thought provoking","An eclectic collection of essays, stories, recollections and observations that are poignant, poetic, thought-provoking, amusing, infuriating and hilarious. Written in Freds unique and very eloquent style.At times you don't know when Fred is departing from the literal truth and entering into the ""Fred Zone"". Frankly I prefer the Fred Zone it's a lot more interesting.I am regular at Freds web site and look forward every week to the latest Fred on Everything columnFred has a way of exposing the [falsehoods]in a way that refreshingly funny and enjoyable. His outlook on life ans attitudes are what made this country great and hopefully will again. Plus Fred will have you laughing or crying or both.You will wish you could have a collection of individual essays on various always handy to give to some loudmouth know-it-all dunce running his mouth on the subject.But this book, read and enjoy. It is true keeper."
3,Blocks,"We like these blocks but they are more for older toddler like about 2 to 3 yrs. I was hoping to use these for building also not just for the puzzle part, but they do not serve that purpose. Wish that you could build from the original and make different patterns but very limited."
3,Tom Slick,"This book was only mildly interesting, and certainly not about the yeti. While a summary of a number of things I know little about, Coleman does not have the flair of a writer that can make non-fiction exciting and come to life. There are so many tangents he could have gone off on, such as Hillary, that would have made the book so much more interesting. If this is an example of Coleman's writing, I probably won't be reading any more."
5,The must have watch,I spend all my time collecting harry potter stuff but when I saw this watch it was a must have and I was right to get it because I now wear it when ever I go out . It's size is perfect for me. I think the best thing about it though is its flip top. I like the big HP to show I am a Harry Potter fan. The clock it self was hard to rate because the hands are See-through to blend with the backgrond so telling time is a bit hard but other than that it made me want to start collecting HP watches alone but I will stick to what I do. Hope you have a maigcal day.
1,Great gift,For the Potter enthusiast this is a great gift. Well made and packaged PLUS the price was right.
4,Alternate versions and oddities yay!,"This remix and B-side collection predates Feist's 2007 iPod-fueled U.S. breakout and isn't particularly Feisty, but her name might get you to check out the rest of this Canadian music collective. An understated schizo battle between plodding dreamscapes and dancey alternarock, from the untitled off-white-noise intro to the anticlimactic but superb finale of Feist's sexy elegy ""Lover's Spit"" (lyrics: ""You know it's time that we grow old and do some sh*%""). ""Bee Hives"" takes a little while to grow on you, but then becomes the rash that won't go away, and you're OK with that."
4,"Good, but the least appealing of the BSS releases","Consisting of B-Sides and alternate versions, ""Bee Hives"" is really the last album you should pick up by the Canadian music collective Broken Social Scene. While there are some unforgettable moments here, such as ""Lover's Spit (Redux)"", ""Backyards"" and ""Market Fresh"", the album as a whole feels less cohesive than their other works and may not find its way into your heart as easily."
1,Taking advantage,"1 1/2Self-absorbed, unwarranted remix and rarity collection hardly rises above muted atmospheric dabbling when not tweaking a few songs effectively in an obvious gesture to exploit sudden popularity after YFIIP."
3,B-sides collections...,"Well... it is easy to tell the band doesn't spend as much time on their b-sides as they do on their album tracks. Besides a small handful of good songs, the rest of the disc feels like filler. You should only buy it if you are a huge BSS fan or if it is listed used for cheap."
4,Does not mention wiki...note publishing date of 2002!!,This is a good book on knowledge management. It provides an adequate historical reference and a succinct framework for the opportunities and incentives for KM but it is as of 2002. This book needs updating. It's not bad but is pre-wiki and web images are dated. Buy used...don't spend $40.00.
1,Only worth flipping through in the book store,"A quick read for those with a passing interest in Chinese Astrology. This particular book is not very detailed, but is a great starting place for those with no previous knowledge of the subject.This book gives the impression of not taking itself too seriously. It is entertaining, and that fact alone makes it hard to take the contents, and the idea of Chinese Astrology, seriously."
2,An Unfortunate Mismatch Indeed,"I must agree with an earlier review, that this CD is, sadly an unfortunate mismatch indeed. Not to take away anything from the exciting voice of Lorez Alexandria, but this is a poorly produced and orchestrated collection."
3,The Mythos of Lenin,"While this biography examines Lenin's family and upbringing, I did not find this text humanizing or enlightening. Service often ventures into psychological speculations to explain Lenin's ideology and tactics. Lenin consistently advocated a one-party, one-ideology state, using terror to rule; otherwise, he used mental acrobatics to enforce his inconsistent position and sustain power. History reveals Lenin's influence as a leader, but this biography does not elucidate his machinations to get there or crucial interactions with leading party members. Ambiguity still surrounds the mythos of Lenin ~ it's still questionable how a factious intellectual came to power and laid a foundation of communism that lasted for decades."
3,Lenin by Robert Service,"All in all, the book got here on time. However, it was missing its jacket (not a big deal, but I assumed it had one.)My main complaint was that there was no tracking information given and that the delivery estimate covered nearly three weeks of time. I would really prefer less ambiguity from sellers."
2,"Cool cover, but the book is boring....","This book looks good on the outside, but is terribly boring on the inside. It goes on and on about how Lenin loved to read books, and debate and that he was sick all the time. He was sponging off his mother so he could continue reading more books. Then you learn about Lenin's travels accros Europe and the letters that he wrote to his mother and sisters. I basically gave up right there, about 150 pages into the book. This book reads like a car manual, maybe in the future I'll get to the end, but right now I'd rather read something else."
4,Excellent overall,"This is truly an excellent book, espically for a biography. Robert Service displays Lenin's life excellently. He presents the public figure, husband and family man, as well as the intellectual, private side of his nature. He has truly made public the three-demensional picture of Lenin.At times this book can be difficult to read. I found myself having to re-read an entire passage at once, but this did not take away much from the book. It is the price one makes for throughness and it is truly worth it. The book is definately a slow read and not intended for light perusal. Those that read this book with a genuine intrest will truly enjoy it.A basic understanding of Russian geography, culture, and history make this book much more enjoyable. However, lack of any of the above will not prohibit the reader from enjoying this book.While this is not an easy book to read, I definately loved it. It was worth all of the hours and focus. This is going on my ""beloved book"" shelf."
2,A Great Magazine Article,"This book would have made a great little magazine article in one of the general-interest publications. As a book, it is sadly lacking. I'm no writer, and any time I feel I could've written the same book, it doesn't say much for the book! There is not sufficient technical information for those seeking learning. There are any number of other books on bicycling that explore the emotional/spiritual side better and in more depth. Same goes for health benefits. What are we left with, then? A good magazine article that has been 'plumped' into 78 pages and a few chapters. Spend the money instead on two or three bicycle magazines and learn more!"
5,Great Bath Exhaust Fan,"I used this fan at a triplex I own where the room was rather small and steamed up very quickly. I didn't want to exhaust to the attic because the building is rather old (90+) and had very limited crawl space in the attic to make sure there was proper ventilation. My choice was to exhaust through the wall and opted to mount the motor outside to reduce noise. It does a great job of removing all air from the bathroom during a shower, and although not silent, it's not too objectionable. I am installing my third one and the other two seem to be working great. It's a little tough to get the RVF 4, as most places, including Amazon are backordered on them. You can find the RVF4 XL, but it uses a lot more power than the simple 4."
5,!Maracujah! - dance music with a Latin edge!,"I looked high and low for this cd and finally tracked it down at Amazon.com. I became interested in this band after seeing the touring company of a very popular Broadway show. One of the stars of that show happens to be the lead singer of !Maracujah!, Christian Mena! I thought he was spectacular in the show and became interested in this band it was mentioned in his bio in the stage magazine. The cd is wonderful with fabulous vocals and a very danceable Latin beat! I would recommend this to anyone looking for something a little spicier than the bland pop that dominates the airwaves today!"
4,A great change!,"I saw Christian Mena in ""Rent"" in both Nashville and Vegas. He knocked me out both times. I had to send to Canada fot the Cd so I am glad to find it easier to get now. It is a great CD, A wonderful change from the mundane pop poluting the current airwaves."
3,Same old-Same old.,"With THE INCREDIBLES movie being such a hit and since the film is distributed by Disney, there's bound to be some supermarketing going on. THE INCREDIBLE DASH is one such item that ties into the Mouse's marketing campaign. The book is supposedly told from the viewpoint of Dash, the middle child in the Parr (or Incredible) family. Basically, the book explains in very easy to understand language the story told in the movie. The book is labeled as a ""Step 3"" step into reading book, but shouldn't be difficult to handle at all for any child half way through the first grade. The hardest words to read are the names of some of the characters, such as Omnidroid and Syndrome. There really isn't anything to set the book apart from any other books of it's type, but since it is a tie-in to THE INCREDIBLES it might encourage reluctant-reading younger children to pick up a book and read. The least incredible of THE INCREDIBLES merchandise that I have seen or read thus far."
1,A package price created by a mad man,"Well, I've been waiting for the availability of Senseo Medium Roast pods for almost a quarter now and left enough comments about the insanity of the decision the company made on their facebook page. It will probably be in future textbooks how to ruin a perfectly healthy and highly profitable business.Today I found this offer on Amazon, ONE PACKAGE for almost $30, is this the creation of a mad man?Here is the deal; I love the coffee, I hate what the company did and selling a package @ $30 does not add to the ""love-it"" part.How much more do you guys try to make sure Senseo will not survive in the long run?Sitting in my chair, still enjoying a Senseo coffee in my cup and shaking my head..."
5,Love Senseo Coffee,I love Senseo dark roast coffee but it doesn't seem to be available anymore! What is going on? I know it's not available in grocery stores anymore but it also isn't available on-line. Does Senseo expect to restock?
1,Was this dealer really an Amazon site?,"We like Senseo Coffee Pods very much; however, when my order arrived, I realized that I had paid as much for one bag of 18 pods as I normally pay for a whole box of packages. I filled out a return slip and mailed the one bag back for a refund--which I have not received. I have ordered several times from Amazon and in the past was always satisfied--until this order. I didn't believe my computer when it flashed that this was a fraudulent site!"
5,Senseo coffee pods,Since we really like strong coffee we always look for a dark blend. This is a good robust flavor. Wish we could still get the combo packs like we used too that gave us more variety than having to order each separately.
2,light blend,The decaf is fine and I use it with a pod of dark roast to create a half-caf 8 oz cup. Low rating for current price gouging. Should be 25% of the cost. Ouch!
1,Waste of money,This book was a huge disappointment. I purchased this book for the express purpose of planning a 5000 mile cross country with my son. The descriptions provided for resorts and attractions are quite obviously provided from the source because I have rarely stayed at such miserable accommodations that were recommended within this guide. My recommendation is to save the money and use a web search and the AOPA directory
3,Okay,Was a bit disappointing that not all information was verified. Enjoyed the reading of the book and the events in the story
1,Warp in plastic lense.,"As received it operates as described, but dead center in the magnifier, taking up about a third of the view, is a blurred ""warp"" in the magnifying material that negates use of this item. I will return it and try another manufacturer."
2,Disappointed.,"For me, this was meant to be a pocket magnifier and flashlight. It did not meet my expectations. It is larger than I thought and not as sturdy as I would have liked. The magnifying glass does not pull out manually, but is battery powered and slow. The light is fine for reading, but is too dim to act as an effective flashlight."
5,"GREAT MUSIC, GREAT FUN , GREAT POINT -- FOR ALL AGES!","CARMAN ALWAYS GETS HIS POINT ACROSS, WHETHER IT BE BY HIS VIDEOS, BOOKS OR CDS. HE USES DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC AND LOCATIONS TO ACCOMMODATE TO ALL LIFESTYLES AND AGES. HE IS DEFINATELY NOT AFRAID TO SHARE THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE SHOULD TAKE HIS EXAMPLE AND SHARE THIS OUTSTANDING VIDEO WITH OTHERS IN OUR LIVES. IT IS OUR MISSION -- TO GO WHERE MANY WILL NOT GO. WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF YOU LED SOMEONE INTO GOD'S KINGDOM? THIS VIDEO AND MANY OTHER SOUND CHRISTIAN AVENUES IS A WONDERFUL WAY TO INTRODUCE GOD & THE BIBLE INTO SOMEONES LIFE."
5,Awsome Video,This is such a inspirational video. We are going to use the Court Room in our youth church service that our teens are in charge of for one Sunday. We have not decided if we were going to act it out or just show the video. The Video is very intense and would be very hard to get the same affect by us acting it out. But this video is really good!!
5,Carman,"This is a great movie that is kinda' like 007, but it involves a whole lot of Jesus. The special effects are awesome!"
5,AN AWSOME DISPLAY OF TRUTH IN JESUS CHRIST,"It is a very moving video of the Lords great and mighty love for each and every one of us. Carmen has done many wonderful things for our youth today. He gives them what they want to see, which is excitement and up beat music and videos. PRAISE JESUS!!!!!!!!!"
1,What IS this?,"I had a group of friends over last night and we were flipping through the channels and came across the last ten minutes of this video on TBN. All four of us watching have been overseas in the past year on mission trips (my point being our faith means a lot to us). What I saw of this video was completely embarrassing. We were all laughing at how incredibly bad this is. I hope that Carman can bring people to Christ, but I wouldn't want any of my non-Christian coworkers or friends to see this for fear that they would think Christianity is cheesy and only good for third rate action videos. But, I saw this on TBN. Guess I should have figured."
1,"An Absolute Mockery of a Film, Simply Amazing","I saw this film earlier today, and I say in all honesty that this has to be one of the most horrible works that man has created in the history of the world. It makes me want to cry just thinking about it. I mean who does this guy think he is, Jesus? I believe in God and Jesus, and to me this is an embarassment. It almost makes me wish I lived in China, where a ....thing like this could never be made. Please, please goods people, avoid this film at all costs, it is evil in its badness. I mean ""Carman"", what the hell is that? Is that even a name? Is it a superhero who turns into cars? Would someone please tell me because I'd like to know."
1,WOW! what am I missing? How does this average 4 stars,"I am not sure what I am missing. I force myself to finish every book I start, but this one truly tested my resolve. I am not sure what the purpose, story or direction this book was trying to take. I never developed even a wit of interest in any of the characters or the story itself. It seemed to me as if the author simply sat down and chronicled the day to day activities of two very different, but not very interesting characters who lived different but not very intersting lives. All adding up to a different but decidedly bad book."
3,"Nice pictures, but doesn't hold their attention","My daughter was 2 when I bought this book, along with a few other bilingual French/English books, for her. This one wasn't a huge hit because it didn't have a ""story"". I should imagine most parents teaching their children a (non-native) second language would have a dictionary - well, you could do the job of this book with just some pictures and a basic French dictionary. Vocab is easy to learn from a dictionary, it's the grammar that you get from stories that really helps you grasp a foreign language. So for that reason, we're steering clear of the ""word"" books now and just reading the stories. My daughter is nearly 3 now, she doesn't speak much French at all, but she loves the stories I read in French, even though she doesn't understand them word-for-word."
2,Don't Bother,"This book is way over priced. While reading the book, I felt as though It was a long advertismet for other peoples work. For instance, there are a couple of stories that are not complete, but your told where to find the rest of it. The majority of the drawings were from old magazines, with a few minor changes. I truely felt as though someone sat down and ""copy and pasted"" this book together. It does however have some interesting tidbits but it's not worth nearly what they charge."
5,Good Value on a great collectible,"I have been collecting baseball cards for a long time, this was a great value on the 2005 factory set."
2,Talented Player But...,"Philip's technical ability is unquestionable. He's fast and I'm sure has the musicality to impress anyone, unfortunately the transcriptions that he chose on this CD are lacking in feel and the quality of the recording has much to be desired.I do like his website and he has some great opinions in it."
1,Dysfunctional Families,I found the title misleading (to say the least). This book is filled with stories about dysfunctional families. If you enjoy watching daytime talk shows you will enjoy this book; but if you want to enrich your mother-daughter bond; this one is not for you.
2,too cute,"I wanted something more appropriate for an adult English learner, but this book is intended for a much younger group. Not a problem with the book, but it just didn't fit my needs."
2,There are better Xmas books.,"As a Christmas collection go, it's fair at best. I bought this book because the list of illustrators sounded interesting.Sometimes these compilations work, sometimes not. Unfortunately, it's a not in this case.It does not showcase the listed illustrators' best work. Not surprising the best illustration is on the cover and its the ONLY one by Gustafson. And the stories are the same ones to be had in any of a million Christmas collections.Collectors and libraries, don't waste your bookshelf space.Treat this as a large Christmas card (and don't pay more than the cost of an Xmas card)to be given to young children and you won't be disappointed. And if the kids crayon in it, who cares."
5,"Sassy, Smart, Funny","How did teenagers survive before Cycle Savvy? We floundered in ignorance, that's how. No more! Toni Weschler never talks down to her readers as she covers everything from the nuts and bolts of menstruation to the insidious nature of modern advertising to the emotional and physical benefits of delaying sex. Girls will learn how to keep track of the not-so-mysterious-anymore wonders of their bodies, and discover how useful this information will be for the rest of their lives. I am so excited to share this book with my daughter...and my son! Guys need to know, too, you know!"
5,"Exceptional, empowering book for teen girls","This book takes on the important goal of empowering teenage girls with knowledge about their own bodies, and succeeds admirably in doing just that. Not only is the book well-written, interesting, informative, and honest, it is also incredibly fun to read -- with great anecdotes, funny cartoons, and charming illustrations. This is a book that teaches teen girls to understand and respect their bodies, and in doing so, it helps them gain confidence and pride in who they are. I highly recommend this book."
5,Knowledge is power!!,"I bought this book as a gift for a sweet sixteen celebration. I found myself reading the entire book before handed it to the girl. It is super illustrative, clear and fun to read. This should be a book that every parent gives and share with a daughter. I love the emphasis of having sex only when you are responsible knowing all the consequences. The book is not prudish. It shows real life examples of feelings and experiences about sex. For Spanish readers it is easy to understand. Do not get discourage for the language.Buy it and share it."
5,Life Changing Information,"I am sending Cycle Savvy to my 14 year old niece. If only this book had been available to me at 14. It would have been extremely helpful to my future when my husband and I attempted to plan our family. After getting an education and working in family planning for the past 20 years I am often surprised at the lack of understanding many educated women and men have of a women's fertility cycle. Cycle Savvy is full humor, personal stories and accurate information on how to learn about your own fertility cycle and how it affects your life as a teen. What a great time to learn about your cycle prior to becoming sexually active as a woman. The last section of the book raises the issues teen face as they consider when they will become sexually active. Cycle Savvy could be a great way to open up this important discussion between parent and teen. This is what I am hoping for my sister and niece."
2,Tie Out Cable - Rusted and Faded,"Perfect for my needs. I have a 40 lb dog who uses this tie out cable. It seems perfectly sturdy without being excessively heavy. It has not kinked or twisted.I did receive a blue cable in case anyone is concerned about color.Edit on 10 Oct 2012.This cable has rusted and has faded to almost white. I don't use the clip on either end, so it is still working for me since I keep a collar permanently on one end. I'd image if you need to use the clip that the rust would make it difficult."
3,The apex of theatrical rock,"Out of all the ""theater rock"" bands Queen is probably the best but should any self respecting man ever utter the phrase ""Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango?"" Probably not.Come now, how can this not be helpful to you. All I'm asking you to do is think. Imagine Lightnin' Hopkins singing ""Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango?"" Imagine Bob Dylan doing it. Or James Brown. Or The Beatles. Or The Stones. Or Van Morrison. Impossible, right? Are you starting to understand now?Look, Queen ain't bad. They're just far from the best, that's all. Three stars is right on the nose."
5,Too Much Brilliance to Even Comprehend,"While ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" deserves all the praise, adulation, and even the parody it's received over the years, what about ""The Prophet's Song""? My God -- that these two tour-de-forces are on the same album / cd is simply insane!!! Mercury, May & Co didn't hold back anything. Was this truly the apex of rock, when it was clearly elevated to a mindboggling art form?"
4,The new DVD is not worth the costs of buying this again,"I love Queen and this is one of their strongest albums (by the Way--Sheer Heart Attack is better), yet the new package offers nothing substantial. The DVD is weak as the spliced-together-to-look-natural-even-though-they-do-not versions of Queen songs are a collection of pseudo-videos that actually detract and distract the viewers. The Seaside, Prodigal Son, and Love of My Life cuts are really quite cheesy and annoying. Before the bashing begins, I am all for new Queen materia1 and glimpse of the videos, but this is somewhat shoddy as they splice together Freddie singing different queen songs that resemble the lyrics of the tunes on the album. It looks weak and as if it it is trying to capitalize on the band.The Music CD offers a similiar sound to the already ""mastered"" recording. If the sound is ""vastly different,"" I do not notice it.More Queen wanted--hold the cheesiness, if you please."
5,Fantastic!,I can't tell you how amazed I was when I heard the DVD in surround sound. I heard some elements of those songs I've loved for so many years for the first time. It was a complete rediscovery of Night at the Opera. The videos are so very interesting. They brought back a lot of memories.
3,woe if you have a problem.,"I like the visuals for this game and the premise. But the interface is awkward and the technical prowess of the designers is minimal -- they can't even change the video mode for the required 640x480 screen size...But my largest problem is with their technical support. My game continually crashes in the ""exploration phase"" of the game and all the pointers sent me to the truly heinous DYAD.com site. So although the game is/would be cool if it worked, I'm not sure it's worth the hassle."
4,MEMORY,"I had a lot of fun building the castle, but when I went inside I kept running out of memory and it would crash. I assigned it more than enough to run according to the system requirements, but it still quits. Maybe I am the only one with this problem, but if you want to play this game, I would suggest having enough memory to hold the Library of Congress. I leave you with this final thought: SAVE OFTEN!"
5,Great game,"For those of you who are puzzle geeks like me, this is an innovative twist on jigsaw puzzles. You can learn how the game works on the beginner level and work through 4 total levels. Exploring the castle is really cool, but finding the missing sword pieces will make you crazy. My only complaint is that you can't control the viewing zoom level on the pieces. Still worth the time. I plan to buy all of the editions."
1,Whathe??,"I tried very hard to read this book. I tried three or four times. It is just impossible. The author must have some idea he is attempting to elucidate, but what that may be is anyone's guess. I think the author is upset that the modern world is not sure about God, and he helpfully points out how certain Catholic writers establish that. I can't imagine anything better except the phone book."
5,Great Storage Bench!!,I did extensive research to find a nice storage bench for a reasonable price. I decided on this one and I am so glad. It was a breeze to put together and everything fit the way it was supposed to. Nice storage space and enough room for two people to sit on it. This is perfect for what I was looking for. Very sturdy and well made.
5,xs racing rocks,"Just picked this game up at a local toy store. I must say I'm impressed. Graphics are awesome. The tracks are pretty well detailed but just wish they were a little longer with more jumps! Ultra fast cars and amazing frame rates. Cars when damaged ""morph"" back to 100%. Just watch those walls in xs of 300 mph. ;) The only thing I wish this game had was a ""no damage"" mode where you could simply race as fast as you want without worrying about wrecking. Course then I guess it wouldn't be fun. Check it out if you like high speed racing games!"
2,not worth much -- except for the photos,"This book consists of a very superficial history of the scooter and its current comeback. Its selling point would seem to be the numerous photos, which dwarf the text. If you typed ""scooter club"" or ""scooter shop"" or ""scooters"" into Google, you would locate most of the useful information. The care and maintenance section is about two pages in length and includes tips such as: ""change your oil after 3,000 miles."" There are no ""how-to"" sections, this book will not help you repair your scooter and doesn't offer much in the way of buying strategies, where you might find used scooters, etc. Buy it used if you must read it."
4,Big! But Useful...,"This case has an angled slot which holds the saw securely. It's not quite centered, which means that it is a little off balance when only carrying the saw. There is a compartment on the right, with a door, to hold blades, and it's balanced well enough with a few blades in there. (Cut some thin cardboard to separate the blades.) A slot in the case also holds the blade wrench.The only two things I don't like about the case are (1) it's awfully big for what it's carrying and (2) it's plastic rather than metal. However, given the size of this puppy, that may be a blessing. Recommended."
3,Decent Case If You're Going To Baby It,"This case feels relatively cheap, particularly the latches. I spent about 30 minutes trying to get the Worm Drive Skilsaw SDH77M to fit in the case. I had to call Skil customer service, they informed me the hook had to be removed from the saw in order for it to fit. Even removed you still need to wiggle the saw a little bit to get the case to close. I would only recommend this case if your going to use it casually at home. If you have to open and close this case on a daily basis I can assure you these latches will break. The only reason I'm keeping this case is because I can't find any other cases for worm drive saws."
2,Strange Texture,"This was a mediocre mouth peice. The texture on it made biting down and keeping your embouchure a bit awkward. Maybe for a beginner this would be ok, but it you've got some serious soprano-saxin' coming up then opt for something better."
1,terrible,the first day i began using this phone it absolutely sucked! it has way too much static and sometimes people cant hear me at all.
3,Pretty music,"My first exposure to the talented Kevin Kendle's music was the composition called ""Sunflowers."" I had never heard anything like it. It was being played on a satellite music channel. ""Sunflowers"" is included on Kendle's 2001 album, Flowers. As for Clouds, this is Kendle's debut album with a release date of 2000. I am pleased with all of the material--eight pieces are contained. Kendle weaves music that is not only atmospheric and lush, but also melodious, floating, relaxing, therapeutic, natural, and serene. Another word that I can use to characterize Clouds is pure--a word that I also use to describe classical music. In addition, the music displays minimal percussion. Not only am I interested in music that pleases me, but I am also attracted to music that is distinctive and that I can feel a personal connection to. Kendle's music fits that bill. The disc is almost 58 minutes. Actually, I rate this piece of work 3.5 stars. Clouds is recommendable."
3,Music For Lovers,"This album was a little too laid back for me. I enjoyed the original version of ""Come In"" so much more than the one on this compilation. It just dragged a little too much for me."
3,Music for lovers?!! I don't think so!,"If I had known that this was a compilation of weary, dragging songs, I wouldn't have bought it. I love Dianne Reeves, she has an excellent voice with a gorgeous wide range, this CD is really quite boring! The title sounds so romantic, but to be honest, I don't think that this is really for lovers.....maybe those looking to break up. Save your money and buy her older recordings!"
4,A fan,"I purchased this CD and was very pleased, even though I Purchased it for the song: Chan's song,(never said). I've enjoyed it so much, I haven't taken the time to listen to any other songs on this CD. Thank You, Amazon"
5,Moved to tears,"When William James coined the term ""stream of consciousness"" a century ago, he was referring to the flow of subjective experience which provides our sense of personal identity. Philip Hii invites each listener into his own stream of consciousness through this remarkable CD. Hii's virtuosity allows a musical expression without limits. Upon first hearing this CD, I was moved to tears. Hii does what each true musician strives for but rarely achieves, a transcendance of all other forms of expression. This CD brings Hii's gifts, which many listeners experienced in awe with his Bach CD, into a new genre. Listen to this CD and find yourself at a level of consciousness you will wish to visit again and again."
3,the CD pictured above is NOT this CD,"the cover of this CD pictures Rose Maddox sitting under a tree or on a fence or something like that (i don't have it in front of me here at work). Also, it does feature more than 1 track, more like 12 or so, which are mostly different versions of songs the group had recorded in the 40's (the original versions can be found on the America's Most Colorful Hillbilly band compilations, the first volume of which is the CD pictured above) rerecorded in the 50's. the quality on this disc is fairly cheap and tinny sounding and is probably only of interest to completists (though New Step it Up and Go IS very good)."
4,Restating the obvious but ...,"Most money matters are fundamentally simple (dont overspend, buy low - sell high etc. ) and so this book re-states the obvious and simple things in simple words. People looking for a formula for financial success will be grossly disappointed with this book (manifested by some opinions here). Its a book that has some good to follow common sense tips.There is not a single tip in this book that hasn't been stated in another book or can't be found on a plethora of web sites. But it collects them and states them in simple words - like a book of quotations. Also - it is not and does not claim to be the ""only personal finance book you'll ever need"" - I hate those ...A good book to read on a flight or a slow afternoon.I think its a bit overpriced at [the money] (hence the 1 * deduction), buying it used [for less money] and it will be worth it."
4,A very good book,"I have read this book and feel it is a very good book to start building a solid financial foundation. This is not a book for the advanced, but for people like myself in their twenties (I'm 28) trying to figure out how they can be smarter with their finances. As I read through the book, I wrote down the ""things"" on a list and checked them off as I completed them. One of the interesting ""things"" was to check my property tax statement to ensure I wasn't be taxed for more property than I owned.Again, this book isn't for the advanced financial planner; but I found it very helpful."
2,You Deserve Better,"Perhaps standing alone this book would be good even recommendable, but there are so many better volumes out there. This book is very basic and not especially informative. I would recommend The Richest Man in Babylon or High Finance On a Low Budget in place of this."
3,"OK for newbie, but there are better books on the subject","This book is ok, but quite superficial. I would suggest another book like The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need.This is not as bad as the first reviewer made it seem. If you only absorb half of what you read, you shouldn't even do any investing. There are risks in the markets, this book tells somethings about it AND it tells how to cope with them. The reviewer (or his dad) hadn't grasped the whole story. So sad to lose your money in the biggest garage sale of the recent history! Read what Charles Schwabs said about the current decline, he has 40 years of experience on the market and has seen three of these bearmarkets. If you absorb the whole story, you'll survive and stay wealthy."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"ARROGANT, SUPERFICIAL AND LACKING SUBSTANCE OR ANY NEW OR USABLE INFORMATION. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THAT IT'S SO SHORT. THAT'S BECAUSE IT COVERS ALMOST NOTHING AND EVEN LESS THAT WILL GET YOUR FINANCES IN ORDER. THE BEST WAY TO ""SPEND LESS"" IS TO SKIP THIS AWFUL BOOK."
5,Wouldn't be without it,I love this masher. You can turn the parts of the potatoes or whatever you are mashing toward the center of the bowl by simply rotating the masher. No more unmashed bits around the edge. I use it also for a baked applesauce and it does a superb job mashing the apples into chunky applesauce. Will probably buy a second one for the RV.
2,Overated :0(,"I thought I liked this product at first because I was supposed to, but the more I used it the more I realized why I hated it. It clumps up half your batch of potatoes after mashing, and it does a TERRIBLE job mashing the potatoes. They come out all extra chunky and lumpy which defeats the purpose of mashed potates in the first place. Very dissapointed."
3,My Masher,"I love the fact that it's easy to use and won't destroy the finish on the pans. What I don't like is it's really hard to get all the pieces of potato out of the inside corners. You can only put it in the dishwasher in the silverware compartment if the handle is down and it takes up lots of room in the basket. I still use it, but not as much as I would if it were easier to clean. It does make great mashed potatoes."
3,"Good overview, light on a lot of details","I agree with the other reviewer that this book glossed over a lot of things, but I don't find that too big a problem. I've gotten other books on electrical, plumbing, and tiling that fill in a lot of the missing details. What I liked about this book was the top-down project management view it gave, which is helping me strategize what to do when on my bathroom overhaul. I read through it once at the beginning, now I'm part way through the job (demolition done, plumbing roughed in, and subfloor fixed) and still find myself checking back as I get to each next step. That's giving me an idea of what to look out for as I get to each next step (electrical, tub, vanity, and tile), from there I just go to my other books and the internet with my questions...."
2,ok but not great,"I've read some other Taunton ""pro"" books that were much better. This one was pretty superficial. The book was too focused on what the particular author's bathroom project was like. It also seemed like the author was trying to get in plugs for various particular products that most of us will not ever use. Particularly for electrical wiring issues, I strongly recommend that readers read an excellent book, Rex Cauldwell's ""for pros by pros"" electrical wiring book, the latest edition."
1,paid for but NEVER recieved,I was extremely excited to be getting this deck but I was told they were unable to send it to me. But my card was never refunded. And now I am being asked to review this product that I paid for but never received for some unknown weird reason. I've let it go but this should probably be passed up.
2,Not what I expected.,"On the positive side, the motor has enough power, even under substantial load. On the negative, I have been unable to make the belt track true and centered. The tool rest is practically useless--it will move as even a moderate pressure is applied. Overall, I would not recommend it as a knife maker's serious tool, relatively low price notwithstanding."
1,"""Neverlast"" Battery",I purchased a Toshiba 900 MHz phone (doesn't have 2 lines like this one) and I had a horrible time with the battery. You couldn't leave it off the charger for more than 12 hours before it started an annoying beep. It will beep constantly even if you're not using it! I thought something was wrong with that particular phone so I exchanged for the same model. I'm having the same exact problem! I also didn't like the fact that you can't turn the ringer off.I've had several cordless phones that you can use for days without having to put them on the charger - this one won't last 12 hours! I'm in the process of contacting the company to see what I can do about this.
1,Battery Problems,"Nice phone, good feel and clear reception. Now its in the cupboard not being used because the battery life is useless. Planning to buy new battery but based on these other reviews I dont hold much hope. I also have a 2 line panasonic, never a problem with that phone."
4,Good value,This 2-line cordless 900MHZ phone is a good value. The battery life is very good (be sure to fully charge the battery before first use) and the dual keypad is very handy. Biggest cons: no headset jack and it's too easy to disconnect the phone when it's craddled between head and shoulder.
3,Cordless Toshiba,"Wish it came w/ a belt clip like other models did? Stupid it didn't. Also, wish it had headphone jack? White would be nice too."
1,Accurate excerpt!?,"If the second sentence of Chapter One is an accurate excerpt from this book, it is seriously flawed:Excerpt from Megawatts and Megatons : A Turning Point in the Nuclear AgeChapter 1ATOMS, ELECTRONS, AND NUCLEIAll matter is an assembly of atoms. A liter of water, for example, contains about 1026 atoms of hydrogen and oxygen.Please, tell me it isn't so. If it were, we'd be able to see those atoms, wouldn't we?"
3,Just okay.,"Their discussion of their attraction for one another is open, honest and refreshing to hear. Their lovemaking is rather quiet and not all that imaginative, hence not all that exciting (to us; you may feel diferently)."
2,Great concept; poor execution,"So far I've watched two of Tony Comstock's films: this one and Matt and Khym: Better Than Ever. I recommend the latter over this one. I really like the concept of filming ""real"" couples who are in love having sex, as emotional intimacy can be even more erotic than just physical intimacy.However, this movie felt very staged, like a stereotypical adult film sans the comedic entertainment value. This feeling was exacerbated by the sometimes ridiculous camera angles chosen by the filmmaker and the fact the shooting angle seemed to switch every minute. The shots I found to be erotic didn't last long enough for me to appreciate them fully.I would not purchase this movie again."
3,"Certainly heavier than the standard ACDelco drum but,",It wasn't machined well. I had to have it turned to get a slight pulse out of the brake pedal. Still glad that I went with it over the standard drum. It's certainly heavier duty.
5,Intriguing,"This picture book for upper elementary has fascinating detailed pictures and printing. The book has a current narrative, which takes the reader into history. The learners may enjoy the fantastic images."
5,Excellent book,"I found it an excellent walk-through of Fireworks. Within a short time, I was applying oval marquees, bevels, drop shadows and other terrific graphic effects. I carry this with my notebook computer -- it goes wherever I go, for the next few weeks at least.[....]Ed Detlie"
2,Good for beginers not advanced uses,"I was hoping this would cover the advanced features of fireworks, but this is clearly not the point. Masking, for example, is barely touched. Compositing hardly at all. I was really dissapointed as it does not help with the great features that set fireworks 8 apart from other graphics programs for the web. I think the online help is actually more helpful and useful.I usually like the training from the source books as a great reference, but this is one time the book falls far short of it's potential."
1,This isn't about fireworks,"I'm being sarcastic here, but please allow me to say that to those of us who actually MAKE FIREWORKS, the appropriation of our already much-maligned word for the promotion of I.T. is just another insult. This, and all these other software application books aren't about fireworks - they're about ones and zeros, and people who live in front of a keyboard, instead of with aluminum and black powder scrunged up under their fingernails, and coming home smelling of sulfur. Hey techno-geeks - how 'bout being imaginative and coming up with a different name for your freakin' software packages, eh?! Stop trying to sparkle up your boring lives by maligning my profession! (lol) :-) -----> * * * *** (BOOM)"
5,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Kid's Tri Wizard Tournament Watch #HC0215,"Very pleased with this purchase. I originally bought this for my kids, but I think I am going to keep it for myself. The watch looks really good and quality versus price is excellent."
1,Not For Me,Accuracy is dependent on holding the scope perfictly still. This would require a tri-pod and is not practical on the golf course. It was of no value to me and I returned it.
2,golf scope,"image is very shakey, accuracy leaves a lot to be desired,would buy something a little more expensive.Batteries have to be reversed from instructions or it wont work,It is ok but i desire a better quality product."
1,ITEM FAILED,"tried and other golfers tried but it never gave the correct yardage to the pin, then while getting a soda someone stole it out of my golf cart so i can`t return, bummer all around.OUT $50.00 & ON A FIXED INCOME. MIKE"
4,So Far So Good,So far I've only used this on the range and it has worked fine. In a few weeks here will be putting it to the real test and the intent in which I bought it for. Once I run it through the trials of it's intended purpose I'll let you all know. Right now I will say though I golf it's not the reason I bought it for.
1,Not for me!,I was looking for an inexpensive golf range finder that would quickly help me pinpoint unknown yardages on some of the golf courses I play. I found the Galileo range finder has too many error variables and lacked the precision I was looking for. It's as accurate as the cheaper etched scopes that go for around $10. I averaged +/- 10% error from 100 yards in. The further out I got became even more inconsistant. I agree with all the complaints about not being able to hold the range finder steady enough to get any kind of consistancy. You also need to have the entire flag visable so blind greens couldn't be scoped. I know how far I hit all my clubs and I need to trust my yardage so I'm sending this unit back today for a refund and I'll bite the bullet and order a $$$ laser unit.
2,Look else where,The model I received had a poor meter on the lens so it was hard to measure the distance. Nothing really close to a good $300 scope.
2,So disappointing,"Has an awful line in it, (meant to be lined up with a golf flag) which makes it almost entirely unusable for anything but golf. Total waste of money as far as I am concerned."
1,oh bother,"difficult to use and almost totally impracticle. i returned one i bought for a friend and one i bought for myself. unfortunately i only recieved credit for one of those that i returned. even then, i would not want back the one that i paid for.glh"
4,Well written and exiting,"This book was a really good read, well written and the author really managed to keep my interest up. I personally found the mix of factual description and personal views from the people involved really attractive. The photo section was also OK with good wartime shots of most of the people involved. I can recomend this book to anyone who has an interest in aviation and the Vietnam war."
4,Pretty Good,"I own this DVD and agree with some of thoughts shared by other reviewers. It definitely has a lot of traditional and basic moves with a lot of repetitions.These do work, but I did feel like I needed variety the next day and wouldnt be able to repeat the video 5 days in a week. Twice a week works well for me. So on other days, I prefer the gym or a different DVD WorkoutMy favorite section in the DVD - Floor work!! It is a lot of repetitions and pulsing..! But works for me, I find sore legs and a tighter [...] the next day.Something worth mentioning also: stretching and cool down section is pretty decent, Instructor takes the time to hold the stretch and explain the importance of the move."
4,Killer is right!,"I ordered this DVD after reading a review about it in my Shape magazine. The DVD starts off with a basic warmup and moves right into squats, lunges, leg lifts, etc. At first I thought the moves did not seem too difficult but the more that you do them and then when you combine them with other moves it gets your heart going. I did not think that I was that out of shape until two days after I did the DVD and could barely walk! It is a great workout and I recommend it to anyone who is looking to tone up their legs and butt."
3,I like the last chapter,"The begining of this video has a lot of your typical lunges & squats which I find to be hard on the knees and aren't very effective for giving your buns a ""lift."" I skip to the last chapter which has some really good floor work. The host keeps me motivated. The music is kind of drab."
1,buy something else!,I tried the excercises in the dvd. They aren't hard but I was very bored. This dvd went straight from the dvd player into the trash.
2,OK for beginners - but thats it...,"As a pro trainer - I always watch a DVD to see if there is a progression plan for long term adherence and improvements. This is extremely important - and most exercise dvds leave this out.The music on this one was weak - and listening to it more than 2 or 3 times gets old fast. I prefer exercise dvds to have no music - so I can choose what I'd like to play, and change it up if I wish.If you are a beginner - this is ok to get you going in the right direction.Joey Atlas, Fitness DVD ProducerButtHipAndThighMakeover.com"
5,Well worth the burn!!,"This DVD is definately a challenge, but it is worth it! I could only do 1/2 the reps she did the first few times I did it, but it gave me something to work for. I try to add a few reps each time I work out. Word of advice--warm up good before AND after the workout. 5 minutes on the treadmill really made a difference in decreaseing the ""day after"" pain!"
2,Not Sure What you would use this stuff for,"I tried to seal parts that would only leak..Do yourself a BIG FAVOR AND TRY HYLOMAR BLUE,,,,,,it is the best sealer for gaskets, covers, etc."
4,1998 Américas Book Award Winners,"An Argentine version of a Quechua story tells how young Topec saved his people from drought by going out in search of rain, aided by the advice of a wise old carob tree. Argentine-born illustrator Beatriz Vidal uses rich colors and a naive style to enhance the mood and setting of this ancient story."
4,Hard Cover not perfect,"The book arrived to me in Italy 20-15 days before the standard international shipping's time. I expected a glossy (i think this is the word) hard cover, but it was ruined, like if it was scraped hundreds of times. The book is otherwise perfect."
1,absolute wastage of my time and money,"I bought this book for my cosmology class and I had to drop the class because I hated the book so much that it is beyond comprehension. The writer does a great job of not explaining anything whatsoever in the book. She just keeps on giving equations and avoiding the gist of them. Horrible explanation so appaling that you don't need to read a horror novel to get scared. Reading this book will literally give you nightmares and suck away all your interest in cosmology. So, my suggestion is that do not buy this book in the first place but rather spend the money in charity to ensure a safe place in heaven when you die. Too bad you can give one star at the least. If there was any way I would have given the book a negative five stars."
1,Broke the first time out of the package,Never got to try these because they broke the first time out of the package. Very poor quality and would not recommend.
1,Not perfect,"Good quality materials. Elastic straps allowed me to sit comfortably. Clips held onto the fabric well and do not slip, however they have sharp edges. With prolong use, it can potentially damage more delicate fabrics. I am hesitate to use it with some of my pants.Update:2/7/2013They broke yesterday. I think I've only used them less than 10 times. I was adjusting the length and the metal flap came off. Tried to reassemble but I guess the metal was too soft and bent with pressure from my thumb. =( Making it 1 start instead of 3."
5,A powerful book,"A wonderful, touching story. Never Fade Away is the tale of two unlikely heroes brought together as they challenge the status quo of a corrupt academic system.John Goddard and Tina Le are beautifully depicted. Hart provides an honest glimpse into their lives and keeps you rooting for them, even beyond the final page.Never Fade Away is a testament to the human spirit. It's proof that heroism lurks in surprising places, and that beneath the emotional baggage we all carry, truth, and even love, can be found."
1,One star is over-rated,I collect antique music boxes and have several books on the subject. I would say that around 90% of this book is devoted to modern toys and there is mere lip service to the exquisite machines from which they were derived.I also found it personally insulting that he claims to include restoration. If I tried to restore a music box after his instructions I would end up with a pile of parts and their condition would be irreperable--more damage than help.
5,Like a Startling Revelation,"Like a startling revelation the ""Trio's"" final studio recording delivers on the promise made in earlier recordings. Once buttonholed (which happens upon first listening) by the reflective and meditative quality of the music you have neither the wish nor the will to tear yourself away. This is experimental music at it's finest."
2,disappointed,not what I expected based on previous experience with other album which seems to be unavailable on cd format. I will not listen to this.
4,"Nice,not his best.","I've been re-discovering Nero via his old vinyls like ""Piano Forte"", and ""New Piano in Town"". Gotta say this doesn't quite measure up, but the guy is in his eighties, now he makes it with savvy and color. ""Hey Jude"" was disappointing, sounding like typical ""OK"" pops stuff, but where is the piano? ""Stardust"", on the other hand, was classy Nero."
2,Textbook,"As a textbook, it was well written but very boring to read. It contains alot of really good ideas teachers can include in their classroom assessments."
4,How to Assess Authentic Learning (3rd Edition),"This book is useful for the classroom teacher, as well as for parents who want to assess their children's reading and learning levels. A very easy read, not complicated at all - and offers simple exercises that make for easy assessment tools."
2,I Just want sharp tools,"I read the reviews on the Grizzly slow speed grinder and decided to purchase it with the deluxe tool rest. When I put the tool rest that came with it on the machine it was not square with the large grinding wheel. After a closer look I found that the base was 1/8"" difference in heigth from one side to the other and the tool rest was 1/16"" difference from one side to the other. The deluxe tool rest had a problem in that if you turned the guide around it would hang up so bad that it wouldn't slide. I called Grizzly and the sent me a new base and one side of the tool rest and a new deluxe tool rest. After about 2 hours of changing the base and different parts of the deluxe tool rests around I was able to get it square with the grinding wheel. But the problem with the guide on the deluxe tool rest is still there. I'm calling Grizzly again and see if I can get a refund and save up for the Tomac."
5,grisly slow grinder,"Only had this grinder for a month . I've gound 15 knives and it does a very good job. So far, so good"
1,suckers choice!,"I find the idea of Planet X interesting and intriguing, yet this book is no better than a coloring book. Frankly, i dont even remember the content of the book therefore this review is pointless. But i must warn the readers of the future, buy this book and learn nothing of the future. It just may be me being a negative nancy!"
1,dang!,I think Planet X came to me after recieving this book. If I were you I'd watch out for Commander X. He'll getcha!
2,Paul Betrays His Solo Material,"This album contains some good songs like We Can Work It Out, And I Love Her, That Would Be Something, Every Night, and She's a Woman, but there are far too many cover tunes. The only redeeming one is Be Bop A Lula. Why is it that the youngest song on this album is from 1970? Where are the Wings songs? Songs like Band On the Run, Bluebird, Silly Love Songs and Listen To What The Man Said could've fit on this album. If he wanted to go with obscure songs, he could've come up with Mrs. Vanderbilt or Not Such a Bad Boy.I remember when the Unplugged concert was broadcast how disappointed I was with the lack of his own material. I still feel the same way."
4,Darker and Subtler Tale than Christmas Carol,"Dickens crafts another dark yet hopeful Christmas tale here. Redlaw is a better developed and subtler character than Ebenezer Scrooge, and his visit with a spirit -- and the results of that visit -- are arguably more heartbreaking. Scrooge learned his lesson by looking in on those people he knew and watching their lives undetected. Redlaw only realizes his mistake once he has inflicted suffering on many more than just himself. There's a clear lesson to the story, but it's a little more interesting than the I found in A Christmas Carol Most everyone knows the importance of being kind to others, but not everyone would think -- or even agree -- that bad memories are an important part of being human."
5,excellent writing to me,"I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS VERY GOOD.SHE COULD HAVE BEEN A HARD PERSON WITH THE KIND OF LIFE STYLE SHE WAS RISE UP IN. BUT HER PERSONALITY WAS STRONG, LOYAL, LOVING PERSON.AND SHE BOUGHT OUT THE BEST IN HIM BEFORE HE HAD HER WITH THE MAKEOVER. YOU SAW THIS WHEN HIS FATHER ATTACK HER WITH HIS WORDS."
1,did not like this product,"We were very disappointed by this product. The metal bars of the bassinet sit directly under the mattress -- you can feel them with your hand so certainly a baby would be able to feel them as well. Seems very uncomfortable and we felt it was a poor design. Also -- the way the bassinet cover fits in place felt unsafe. We put it together, immediately took it apart and returned it. With our first child we borrowed a bassinet from a friend. It did not have these design flaws. Seemed as if the design of the product was for ease of packaging rather than for safety or comfort."
4,Must have for Corn Snake Fanciers,The photographs are breathtaking; so much so that you want to see more. It's concise and intelligently written. This book should be in every corn snake fancier's library.
5,Easy to shape and install,"Definately less recoil felt on my old shotgun, After I shaped it to the stock with my belt sander,it blends perfectly to my gun"
4,Great Basic Information,"Great beginners book. This book gave me very good basic information on coral identification and classification. The accompanying photos are very clear and extremely helpful. It also gives very sound advice on the types of fish and invertebrates that would complement each other in a typical tank. The section on algae has very good info on the identification, effects and control of specific problem algae. The photos of these algae are better than those on other books i've read. All in all, I believe that this is a book that would provide the beginning marine reef keeper with practical information he could use to ensure his tanks' success"
3,Good primer,"Good primer, however I found myself searching for additional information.I think this is as the headline suggests a good primer, and a goodsource of information for review."
2,Academic bent.,"As a dissertation this book works well: it contains high level coverage of the theories associated with computer use, and web use in particular, especially descriptions of academic research in that area. Unfortunately it doesn't provide the grounded, current, specific information and examples that would help a commercial practitioner improve web products under development"
2,I had big hopes,"Useless, save your money.I had great hopes for this book, unfortunatelly is just a collection of elements of design of various sort, for various purpose, nicely packed together, an academic attempt maybe, but of limited if not zero practical use.Being published in 1997 doesn't help of course, but theoretically the content should not get outdated for decades."
2,"Don't buy this book, I'll send you mine.",Sorry to disagree with the rest of you but I thought the plot and the characters were very shallow. The fiancee/sister was the only one that showed any intelligence. The only reason I finished reading it was because I bought the book and I hate to waste my money.
1,Not her best book!,I hated the characters! The only charater that i did like and had intelligence was Helen(sister and fiance). I didn't like the plot at all.
1,Oh Aaralyn.......,"Listen babe, I'm glad you know all about the Iraq War and the troops being sent to Iraq and blah, blah, blah, but I would just like to ask one simple question, What the F*uck does that have to do with this god awful show?I'm glad you are sticking up for what you believe in, but really, no one gives a (...) on where you stand in the war, so thanks for your review, but really, don't act as if everyone who writes negative reviews about this show thinks that those who do like it are stuck up themselves....The truth is, we just hate this show!!!!PS. Laguna Beach (...) SUCKS........."
3,problems with shipping!!!,"I ordered one copy of this video - I received 2 - one at my billing address and one at my shipping address - Apparently, you kept an old credit card (which I do not use anymore) on file, and billed that card plus the one I entered when ordering this item. I do not wish for you to keep my billing information on file and I am still waiting for a return label to send back the additional copy. Please make sure you send it to my Florida address!! and credit the card you were not given permission to use.Thank you"
2,Not the same as I remembered...,I was so excited to see the price of this series had dropped. When I received it I watched it and became disappointed. I could not remember this season being so cheesey and boring. I wish I could return it.
5,...,this show rocks.the place is beautiful.the kids can be stuck up sometimes but the drama is addicting.worth every penny :)
1,What a dumb show!,"MTV has gone from a channel about music to a channel that is for stuck-up snobby rich kids. I don't understand how people can sit through shows like this. It doesn't make you think at all. All the people in this show are idiots. All they do is whine about how they lost their girlfriends/boyfriends and the usual things that stuck-up people talk about.Reality TV is a very flawed concept. Whoever came up with it needs to be shot. I hate the fact that people make shows like this popular. To whoever watches this show, read a book or something."
1,Probably the worst show on TV,"I'm amazed that this show made it to DVD, much less it being on the top seller list. This show is garbage, and writing a long review about how bad it is would just be a waste of time and bandwidth. This review was written to counter the ludicrous 5 star ratings."
3,i dunno,"dunno, half the time i love this show... but many times it's boring, and i can't figure out which one is L.C. etc...the only great part is that steven is SOO friggin' hott!!!! But all the girls are always allover him.& oh yeah. to you- ""What up"", you said there are a bunch of hot girls and guys. ???? what? ummm ok im done :>) it says ur a kid 2, hopefully u r over 13 though saying that!"
2,Just watch it on tv....it comes on almost everyday right now,"I kind of liked some of the episodes from season one, but I wouldn't pay close to $30 just to watch something that comes on all of the time on tv. I can't stand Kristen, and she seems to take over season 2, from what I can tell in the previews. So I'm not too happy with it anymore. If you do like this show, just watch it on tv...don't waste your money."
1,save the drama for your mama,"I periodically watched this show throughout the season on MTV and you know the only reason why these snott nosed orange county high schoolers got their own show was because of their rich families. Somehow i'm still drawn to this stupid show and have no idea why. I guess it's like a bad car accident. . .you don't want to look but it's there so your just drawn to look. I wouldn't suggest buying the Laguna Beach DVD. Why would anyone want to contribute money to these rich b***hes. Actually, I'd give MTV money just to take it off the air. . .PLEASEEE!!"
3,"Soapy Goodness; Like ""the OC"" w/o the funny","The show is like cheez whiz: a steady diet will kill you, but for what it is, it's yummy in small doses. The show is not great drama, or even great reality TV, but is like great gossip. Pretty people doing stupid things and getting their feelings hurt: if this is interesting for you to watch, then this is the show for you. It is almost gloriously empty of thought or any deeper ambition. The only reason I give it three stars is that a show this disposable really isn't necessary to put on DVD. I doubt you'll watch the episodes more than once or twice -- which is more than enough. It'd be much smarter to just rent/Netflix these babies."
1,Unwatchable...,"This is some sort of reality/yet also partially poorly scripted show about some unattractive youth on the west coast. They were laughably dull and unintelligent, but not nearly entertaining enough to actually watch. The boys like to complain or something like that, and the girls enjoy buying things and sharing their vaginas. Must miss!"
1,Ugh......,"Alrighty...so I bought this item at a decent price, so I can't complain about that but I could not even get through the third episode...the girls are EXTREMELY annoying with their whiny little snobbish voices...ugh...I couldn't stand it!!! It's more like a soap opera. I have enough drama in my own life...I definately don't need to be watching people who create drama purposely!"
2,REAL OR NOT REAL!,If Anything this Show hits the Point of all Stereotypes but what makes me Dumbfounded is how Fake the show really is.I lived in Laguna Beach and I can say that the people I hanged around with are nothin like these people but with that said I left laguna because I couldnt stand the atmosphere of the Mudane Lifestyle.The Producers should tell the Truth and really any Young Audience will fall for this mediocrisy and any type of Fashion.
1,What a waste of time,"I've only seen like 5 mins of one of the episodes of this show and blieve me, it was more than enough for me to turn it off. Like I really wanna waste my time watching rich spoiled little brats whinning over something like ""I only got a new car for graduation...I asked for my own beach house"" or some stupid crap like that. Please, these kids wouldn't know real life if it ran into their new corvette that there daddy just bought them. I got better things to do with my time like actually working for my money. Anyone who actually likes this show REALLY needs to get a life."
1,totally fooled.,"i gave 5 for this show....until i just found out that the show is scripted. actor/actresses (since they don't use their legal names) are foced to say certain. For example, dieter's real name is ryan... all i know is mtv fooled me really well. from now on, i am not going to buy dvd or watch the show. it's sad to see how mtv turned into a capital greedy coporation. liar!"
5,the best reality show ever,i love this show although i am only 14 (this is my mom's account) its so much fun. Between the drama and party's its great. Like every kids dream to grow up rich and have great friends like that i recomend this to anyone who likes The OC its just so much more real and beleivable cuz its about real kids and their real problems I cant wait for season 2 to start July 25th !!!!!
4,Come On...,"Before you say something negative, look at it from their point of view. You can't judge someone until you've walked in their shoes. yes Laguna Beach may be all rich people and everyone may think that they're stuck up, but in all reality, they're just normal people living normal lives. They're all trying to get through high school and now some of them college. You can't judge someone just because they seem some way. MTV takes a lot of things out and revises stuff and adds stuff to make it seem like they're all rich and stuck up and they're not. MTV probably added stuff in there to make it seem that way. If MTV went to some poor country and filmed stuff like that, everyone would be like ""oh they're poor and im not going to watch it because of it"". And that's what people are saying about Laguna Beach. ""Oh they're rich and stuck up so im not going to watch it"". So when you say something like that, just remember they're just normal people living normal lives just like everyone else."
4,Great Show,This is almost my favorite show.I will tell u all the main characters Kristen-Brat LC-Good One Stephen-Ladies Man Lo-Kind of Slow Trey-Serious One Morgan-Revranes Daughter.The real main chracters are the top 3.The whole story is about all these people listed live in the O.C.Kristen is Stephen's gf but their relashionship goes on and off.But LC hangs out with Stephen alot and Kristen get's jealous of her and say's mean things about her.Older people may not like because they may think it's nonsense.
3,Love LB,I love this season ... got me to think about good ol days . The CDs were in plastic cases which i don't think were the original but nevertheless the CDs played and were in great condition
4,Gets you hooked so you cant let go..I was completly addicted,I loved this show I cant believe how addicted I got. The first episdoe wasent the greatest and there was so much charactors I was confussed but I watched another one and I was addicted. It's about a group of rich kids living in laguna and did I mention it's all real. It's a relality show but it dosent look like one which makes it good. When the season ended I wanted more what happend after that. Caint wait for season 2.
3,Laguna Beach,"The DVDs are in alright condition, but they didn't come in the box that is posted on the site, they came in like, old rental boxes for Laguna Beach. I was under the impression that I was getting a used copy of the season in it's box as pictured, but it wasn't. Also, used to me meant it was someone's, but it's an old rental, so it should've said REALLY used by a lot of people."
2,"Heavy on Tony, light on music.","I bought this DVD after listening to Tony Rice and Dan Crary trade off on the song ""Cattle in the Cane"" on Dan's CD ""Jammed If I Do"", and his guitar performances on ""You Were There For Me"" with Peter Rowan. On both of those albums he is very fluid and very versatile. Unfortunately this DVD only has 5 songs in tablature on it, the rest of the time is spent with him talking about picks, capo's right hand position and the like...That's fine if you want to be exactly like Tony Rice but as a purely instructional video, it falls flat. It's less of an intimate lesson of his playing style, and more of a fawning over the man himself. Hey, if you love the guy and can't get enough of him, buy it; but don't expect to learn much from it."
2,Spiderlite5,"I will update my review once my Spiderlite is repaired or replaced. I purchased the large light kit new but it was defective out of the box. So sad... One of the toggles is bad or there is a short somewhere because if I turn the middle switch on I hear a pop and my circuit is blown. I am afraid now to even turn any of the lights on. So, two stars for a nice lighting concept but poor quality control. The unit is made in China."
5,Must-buy for 'Pedagogist-Technologists',"The people in the e-learning industry could be divided largely into three camps - the Pedagogists, the Technologists and the Pedagogist-Technologists (people who bridge the two apparently divergent worlds). :-)IMHO, Dr Margaret Driscoll is a Pedagogist-Technologist - a wonderfully excellent one! After ploughing through dozens of good and not-so-good books on e-learning, I find this book (which I borrowed from a campus library) a treasure trove. I strongly recommend this book to any serious e-learning practitioner (novice or experienced) who is looking for succinct and practical information, as well as pedagogically and technologically sound tips - this book is loaded with summaries, templates, worksheets, and more."
3,so so generic web book,"A very average experience, not bad but not great. More of link are outdated and info is very basic they would of done better by integrating material from the open source LMS world to add more relevant punch"
5,Not all that,"This book doesn't follow the movie, which upsets my daughter. She still loves it and it was a cheep book bought on a cross-country move."
2,False Information,Most of these things if not all in this book is fals information. Or exagerrated to make interesting.
1,"Byron Williams is funny ! In fact, he's a Clown.","Byron Williams claims to be a college educated writer, but he writes like he's in grade school. Why didn't he have his book edited by an experienced writer? Dumb.Bryon Williams was a paid bodyguard, but diffinetly not a professional bodyguard. After reading his book, what a cry baby, it is obvious that I wasted my money."
1,garbage,"This book [stank]. I wish I would have saved my money. All Byron did was complain about money. He agreed to his compensation and then complained about it. He wanted to control how eminem spent his own money. That is the whole book. A grown man upset because he wasn't the famous one. His point in this book was ""I am going to use eminem to get myself & my rap group famous."" I wish I would have known that before I purchased this waste of paper."
1,Whining Fest,"I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy. All this guy does through the whole book is whine. The majority of the book is about the fact that he thought he was underpaid & oppressed, yet no one was holding a gun to his head to stay with Marshall Mathers. He repeats himself over and over and over again. This book is just one big whining fest."
2,Shady Bizzness,"Interesting book, though it definately skipped any type of editing process. I think Byron and Slim had a good relationship, but it was ruined by B.'s constant backstabbing and complaints about money. Them's the breaks, you paid the price. Byron portrays himself as a God-fearing man, but has a few things to learn about telling the truth (lying to his company about why he took leave). Good luck to you B."
1,Shady ass bodyguard...,"I don't know why I read this book, it was like being sucked into the gossip and you just know it's more hype than it is fact!! I feel ashamed for buying this and reading it!! Shady Business is just a former bodyguard trying to make some money off a man with a name for himself. However I guess we all have a story to tell and this is his weather it's true or not.... It'll be up to you if you want to believe the hype or not?!"
5,Meet the real Slim Shady,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was both interesting and exciting. Interesting because Byron and Eminem have very different perspectives on life. Exciting because you get a glimpse of what an Eminem tour is realy like. Its like having a backstage pass. You get to know all the people involved, and what the fans are like. Anyone who wants to know what Eminem is really like should read this book. Its like meeting the REAL Slim Shady. But, behind the rap persona is Marshall Mathers. This book gives you an insight into the clash of the two coming together. i'm a big Eminem fan and the book was great to see what Em is really like. Alot has been written about Eminem and his lyrics, this book gives you a look at the man behind the songs. A must read for REAL Slim Shady fans! You can't help but to love him and hate him at the same time!"
2,fake crap,it's hard to belive anything that's in this book. Most of it is sounds true but seems like it has added things to sell or to make Eminem seem like a bad person.
2,Shady Bizzness,"This book could have been good, but it definately needs editing.I believe Byron was trying to be friends with MM, but gripingconstantly behind his back about money ended any chance of that.Byson tries to portray a religious man, but says that he lied tohis regular job about why he took leave (to work on the tour). I lost respect for him with that. Good luck though, Byron, just be straight with people, backstabbing will get you every time."
1,Disappointing Card Graphics Program,"I had been using Print Artist (PA) 4 for many years but wanted to move up to a newer version with more graphics; also, i couldn't get it to work on Windows 7. I tried various other similar software but not nearly as good at PA4. So thought i'd try PA8 which sounded like a step up with 8 CDs instead of 4 with PA4, version 8, and being ""Grande Suite"". May be i haven't given it a fair chance yet but so far, but the menus are very plain and boring, has a different look and feel, less graphic selections, and overall seems much less user friendly than PA4. PA8 does work with Windows 7, but i probably won't be using it."
5,Great strength/toning workout,"Please note, as of 11:35 a.m. EST on 1/17/2008, the product description listed under ""Editorial Reviews"" is not for this video but rather for Charlene's High Intensity, Low Impact workout. Women With Balls is an hour-long strength/toning workout (not aerobics) divided into two half hour segments. Both workouts are great, I own both and they both deserve 5 stars."
4,A Walk in Wolf Wood,"I really liked the book A Walk in Wolf Wood because it was a good easy read. Although it was easy to read it was not a boring book. I love books that take place in the Middle Ages like this one. It is full of enchantments and friendships. Parts of this book reminded me of Harry Potter books. This book kept me on my toes to find out what would happen next. There was always a new twist or turn when I thought that I had it figured out. The end was great, not one of those that let you down."
2,not up to Stewart's standards,"I read this after it was recommended to me by a couple of friends, and then I saw it on Amazon's bestseller list. I was... well, underwhelmed, shall we say. I am a big Mary Stewart fan, and have read at least a dozen of her wonderful books. But this one was populated with unbelievable characters, stock plot situations and besides, it was boring. :)"
2,Not exactly what I'd call an exiting spin.,Rather dull. Boring dialouge. Not much of a plot. I really didn't like this book very much. Mary Stewart can do better then this with-out-a-plot-extremly-dull-I-would-not-suggest-book. Walk in Wolf Wood in boring and I would not suggest reading it
3,A Walk in Wolf Wood,"When I started to read this book, it wasn't counfusing, but it was, diferent... I liked it, as far as ""two kids, cought in the mid evil time, that has a friend that turns in to a evil beast of terror, in the night.."" It's a good plot, it just doesn't suite me. But every person has they're opinions. Any way, so I would have to say this book is for any one who is an adventurest person.No offence, but i couldn't really get into this book. But that doesn't mean you can't! It's a good book. Read it, see if you like it. And if you don't, hey, at least you tried. And if you do like it. hey, cool, good for you.So like i said before, every one has they're own opinions, I'm just telling you mine. I'm sorry if this didn't help you alot, or at all. But, you know, at least I tried."
5,Good Sand,My hermies love digging around in this stuff! Plus the colors are really cool! :) I definitely recommend this product!
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,I ORDERED THIS ITEM ON 9 JULY WHICH WAS ADVERTISED AS A DVD WHICH IT IS NOT - IT IS A CD - YOU WERE NOTIFIED OF THIS BY A REVEIWER ON 1 AUG - AT LEAST 4 DAYS PROR TO YOUR SHIPPING IT TO ME - I AM FURIOUS - NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE EXERCISE OF RETURNING IT FOR A REFUND - I DO NOT EVEN WANT IT FOR FREEAGAIN LIVID AND FURIOUS
4,Great protection.,"A tad pricey, but still cheapest on Amazon. They afford very good protection from punctures (none yet, after months of riding). Not the easiest things to work with when installing, but that's expected."
3,Cheap-price and quality,"Great price, speakers are worse than my laptop's built-in speakers. It is probably worth saving an extra month to get better quality."
2,Great sound then unit broke in 100 days,"Loved the sound, design, cost and one day speakers just stopped working. Charging continued to work. No way to fix it. Called iLuv and emailed them with no response."
3,Great looking - so so sound,"My title sums it up. The Altec Lansing InMotion has better sound, but does cost more. So price wise this is a decent buy for the money. I rated this 3 stars, but considering the low price you can add another for cost factor."
4,Perfect for your office/cube,"Perfect size and sound for a small area, like an office or cubicle. Perfect!"
4,good,"This is a good little product. I purchased one before, which worked great for about two years. Then it died. So, I'd estimate that you can expect a solid 2 year life of good sound out of the product. Unfortunately, when I recently tried to replace the product, it arrived defective. Amazon was good about refunding the money, however! So, despite my experience with obtaining a defective one, I recommend trying this product out."
4,The Joint Connection -- Saving Grace has music for all ears,"A fabulous soundtrack with a terrific mix of musical styles and genres. This movie soundtrack contains a nice balance between pieces from the movie's original score and popular songs of the last few years. This music nicely parallels the film itself: Grace, a conservative, older woman -- reminiscent of the orchestrations of classical music that play throughout the film -- turns into a grower of marijuana who wants to be ""hip"" in order to make some fast cash to save her home and estate. A great soundtrack for all to enjoy!"
2,incorrect information,"The author doesn't even know the difference between reptiles and amphibians. She states that herps that live in water are amphibians, which would make a turtle an amphibian. (Amphibians do usually live in water, but this characteristic is not what defines the difference between a reptile and emphibian.) Even though turtles are reptiles, and therefore you would think that they would be included in this book, they are not. For turtle info, she directs you to her turtle book. Most of the rest of the information in adequate, but there are much better books out there. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Eve Ensler for President,"Eve Ensler has struck again & I hope to find more of her stuff soon. Although not as good as ""The Vagina Monologues"" (a fantastic must-read!), ""Necessary Targets"" is still a touching story (in play format). Just the sheer joy of knowing that Eve Ensler is out there somewhere made me read this book."
4,Good look,"This is a good play. The characters are compelling because they are real. Violence against anyone should be brought to life, whether it be domestic or the aftermath of a war. The characters who were sent to counsel the women have insecurities of their own, which is a comforting reminder that life is hard for everyone."
5,Necessary Targets,"Excellently written with compassion and descriptive language. While you were reading, you could see the settings and know the faces and believe you were there. Gifted writer."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Maybe I didn't read the description or other reviews carefully enough, which figures, but I was dissapointed. It was kinda cheesy, I thought. I think I thought it was going to be videos of live performances, but it was a documentary of them recording Blood Sugar Sex Magik.glad to have it in my collection, but would rather have not paid as much for it."
2,Not a documentary...not a concert film...,"Short amd sweet: if you want a documentary, look elsewhere...if you want to hear the guys play, gety ""Off the Map."""
2,Worst documental,"This is one of the worst documentals I've seen, I LOVE the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but I'd rather buy a music cd than this! DO WHATEVER YOU WANT but this is really B_O_R_I_N_G."
1,No real music,Not happy. Big fan of RHCP and really disappointed with this video. Mostly interviews. Buy live at slane castle for a real treat!!!
4,"Not ""Unisex"" Sizing!","Should've known better... it is simply Men's sizing. No way the small could fit an average size woman. I wear a size 7 typically, and the ""small"" were huge on me. Too bad... really wanted them! I will give them to my brother, as they are a nice pair of gloves."
5,Too Cool,"This is a great book it goes form month to month with explanations and ideas of how to celebrate the pagan way. It is a little confusing though because the Samhain is the witches new year, however this book starts in December. A little confusing. It is a great read nevertheless and it is very informative."
4,Monthly activity suggestions,"A book that you contemplate if you are going to use some of the techniques offered to spruce or change some daily effects. Very earthy and grounded suggestions if you tend to be ""scattered auto pilot"" in your life and need to connect with the Universe for a year."
2,Grade school level,"Besides the quality of this looking like someone printed it off at home back in the 80's, the overall content just sounded repeated. Like the author heard it somewhere and thought it sounded good to write down. That aside, this is a good book for begginners who just want to get their toes wet. It has plenty of basic information and pictures for those who need them. Not a highly recommended book, but a nice addition to anyone's personal library."
3,Not what I thought.,"Although this book is delightful and has useful information, I actually found little information on the Sabbats and found myself wondering why some information was placed where it was? There is some good and traditional ideas like the baking of bread in August, but I saw nothing significant about telekinesis in February, I think it was? This book is also impractical. It's not fluff, that's right, but there is little that people without a lot of time on their hands can apply or try for themselves. It's a good book, but I wish it would have given more information on the Sabbats themselves and talked about the traditional Sabbat feasts."
4,Warm And Inspirational Look At The Neopagan Wheel Of The Year,"Miss Campanelli did a wonderful job writing this book. Her elaborate descriptions of the various Northeastern US seasons and personal glimpses on how her family celebrates each month and season make this a very warm and inviting read for anyone wishing to incorporate more Pagan traditions and outlooks during the course of the year.My only quibbles are that 1.) It is difficult to tell which pieces of historical information are accurate and which are the products of Neopagan wishful thinking (all too common in the writings of many Pagans of the 20th and 21st centuries), and 2.) There's no bibliography; I would have liked at least a few references noted in case the reader wanted to delve deeper into the different Magicks discussed, historical traditions expounded upon, herbs to use, etc.All in all this is a cute and enjoyable read for anyone wishing to see the Year-cycle from a truly devout and sincere Neopagan standpoint."
2,Not for everyone,"This book gives detailed and useful suggestions of activities and crafts for the Sabbats. However, I found the descriptions of the seasons too wordy. Also, the crafts and activities are definitely written for people who live in the country AND have a lot of time on their hands. Having neither of these two requirements in my life, I found the book did not help me at all in my seasonal celebrations."
4,"Despite a couple of weird problems, a good resource book","This book is full of information and ideas. They are well-organized and well-presented. The writing is easy to read and the book is suitable for people in many different traditions. The only problem was I found a couple of glaring errors. There weren't enough to totally turn me off to the book but they sufficed to make me read it more critically than I had planned to and check references I normally would not have worried about. The error I use as an example when asked is the reference to yellow being such an important springtime color that the Jews use yellow coloring in their challah for Passover. Since Passover observance prohibits the consumption or even possession of leavened bread, this claim is just silly. However, it wasn't so silly that I dismissed the rest of the book on the spot, and I did enjoy reading it."
1,Great Film-shoddy transfer,"This complex film deserves to be better known. It belongs with ""1900"", ""The Tin Drum"", ""Siberiade"", and other great historical epics of the 1970s.Unfortunately it's unwatchable on my HD laptop due to a lousy transfer. Looks okay an analogue television."
1,Waste of time,I found the film over the top. Borderline cartoon-like in its portrayal of the characters. The communist flavored take on ruthless capitalism saturates the whole thing. Another couple hours of my life wasted that I'll never get back.
1,Not as described,Its not so much the item but rather the seller. This was described as a VHS tape. This was purchased for my 90 year old father who is the only person in the world who has no DVD player. He still has his VCR and I wanted to buy this in a VHS tape for him. The item came as a DVD. I tried twice to contact the seller and let him know he sent the wrong format. I told him I would gladly just pay extra for the VHS tape but I never got a response. Twice I communicated and nothing to date. I will buy the item from another seller and I have a note to myself to stay away from this seller.
2,their best years are behind them,"metallica tried to make money of 1 already released studio song and 6 live ones, not worth buying."
4,"Impressive, but...","Metallica couldn't have released anything worse than St. Anger. So the overall impression is much better than on the last album. Great, ultra-fast songs and solos in live versions and looong title song (with solo missing :( ) with the shortened version for impatient ones. Minuses? Extremely poor drums (but slightly better than on the St.A) and weaker voice of Hetfield (fortunately not all the time). But do you know who's performance is beating the other ones? The most criticized member of 'Tallica - Rob Trujillo has done his best. His Fernandes bass almost explodes from the speakers! BIG PLUS. Anyway, worth buying."
1,I wont even comment on this crap....,"this is a rehash or previous releases, more metallica money grubbing attempts....save your money"
3,...................,"What do you want me to say? This album is pretty good except for that they should have more live tracks! Metallicas' still good. But it just seems like they're missing something. I never really liked Some Kind Of Monster(the track, not the movie). Though the edited version of the song sounds better than the original."
1,some kind of crap!,"I wish Metallica would just retire,they haven't put out a really good album since ...And Justic for All.The only thing they've made since then that I can sit through is S&M,because it takes good tracks off otherwise dull albums.Metallica has been striking out all over the place since the late 90's.YOu'd think after ST.Anger nobody would run out and make another Metallica CD go platinum,those that bought this obiviously didn't learn a lesson from ST.Anger.I bought ST.Anger and have vowed not to by another new product from Metallica.I've found better CDs in the 99 cent bin.Pass this up,go buy the new Megadeth CD instead,at least they still put out decent albums."
2,Some Kind of Sellout,"Which is what I believe this album should of been called. Metallica has been dead for years. It's an embarresment now. The only good thing about this album was that it wasn't as bad as St Anger and that it actually can be used as a good frisbee.E F E F gets really old James. Kirt's solos have not improved at all. There the same ripped off chops they always have been. However I will admit there were a 'couple' of good licks that he improved on.Lars, I won't totally diss him, I'll leave that for the Pro-Napster people to do. All you have to do is listen to a clip to see his 'drumming.'Bassist? What bassist? I thought he died in 1986. Basically Metallica is getting more lazy and trying to amke anohter buck. i saw it with the Black album and it's gotten worse since."
5,Nice addition for Metalica Fans,"This CD contains 2 versions of the song Some Kind of Monster from St. Anger, along with six live tracks from June 2003. The live songs are rarely played live and will appeal to Metallica fans who already have some live versions of the songs Metallica always play live. I have really enjoyed it so far, and the version of Damage Inc. is fantastic. However, I do think that more casual Metallica fans would also enjoy it because the band really sounds best when they are playing live. It is hard to find and band that puts together a live performance the way Metallica does. Also, I have seen the movie, and it is definitely worth seeing, even for non-Metallica fans."
1,"Metallica's ""NEW IMAGE""","Yeah bands change but this is not change this is crappy, I could make better music. Where are the guitar solos, the meaningful lyrics in Metallica's new music? Honestly I have no problem with a bands sound changing, but normally you expect them to get better not worse, I like metallica because they are good, but their new stuff isnt, its that simple."
3,They should stick to the old stuff!,"The live songs are great, but I am one of the many people that believe they could have stopped after ""And justice for all"". The guys can still jam, ""Hit the Lights"" is just awesome."
1,Some kind of Ulrich,"Hey I've got a Metallica joke for everyone - oh wait everything Metallica does is a joke now - haha! Seriously are people paying money for this? Thats astonishing! Some kind of Monster has to be you my friend for buying this and helping in the success of what appears to be the biggest musical joke since Milli Vanilli! Oh yeah Im over the age of 13, sorry I missed your box."
1,Is there anyone left to listen?,"Ooh. One whole new song! Let me drop everything and pay for some cut that wasn't ""good"" enough for a regular album. This is like S&M a self-serving way for the band to exploit the few fans it has left. Do yourself a favor. Wait for it to come out on Napster, or even better. Don't bother. This band started to fade away when they hired Jason Newstead (who should've stayed with Flotsam & Jetsam) and shrieked their death knell when they put out Garage (Garbage) Inc. and attacked their fans for downloading their songs when they themselves copped to making illegal copies of their favorite bands (read the liner notes for Garage Inc. if you think I'm blowing smoke). Good riddance to the money-hungry, short-haired whiners. At least Megadeth knew when to quit."
4,Very Nice EP,"First off let me say that 'Some Kind of Monster' was one of my favorite songs off the controversial 'St. Anger' album, and this here is the cd-single/EP of that track...the live tracks here document the band's early days, and are performed flawlessly with the band sound as energetic and vital as ever...but i have to say the real surprise and standout for me on this album, was the edit and remix of the title track: THIS is the way 'St. Anger' should have sounded! the song is punchier and just sounds a 1000 times better than the original version despite being cut down to about 4:15, buy this for that gem alone!...also, the added t-shirt is a nice addition, albeit a very wrinkled one when you first buy it lol...well this is a solid EP, with some great live tracks and a killer remix of 'Some Kind of Monster', let's hope they remix the rest of 'St. Anger' like this"
2,Can i get a refund?,"If you're going to spearhead the movement on piracy and copywrite laws you better damn well put a good album out . I'm not talking about two or three good songs either . As a consumer I'm entitled to know what I'm buying . If i knew the singing on this cd lacked any balls and the drums sounded like someone beating on garbage cans i wouldnt have wasted my hard earned money on it . The setlist is great ...Motorbreath , Hit the Lights , Damge Inc etc ...the execution stinks . This is fourth time Metallica has stolen money from me . Reload , St Anger, S&M and now this peice of #$%. The question is ( and its a good one )...do i have any rights as a consumer ? or have i been hoodwinked again by three whiney washwomen posing as a metal band ?"
5,Quality EP,"This EP features the full length album version of Some Kind Of Monster, including 6 live tracks recorded on June 11, 2003, in Paris, France. The biggest highlight for me was the edited version of Some Kind Of Monster. It sounds amazing! I just wish the would have let some of the intro play out, but nonetheless a great EP. Highly recommended."
5,Same great quality as all Shun products,I bought this as a Christmas present for my son who is a professional cook. He already has a large collection of Shun knives and was very pleased with this one.
2,Too museum-esque,"I think the hallmark of good design is the ability to maintain that integrity while also moving with some elements of style from the period in which you actually live. I guess the title really means ""CLASSIC interiors;"" the book shows how to create interiors that would have looked appropriate in 1763. Today, a number of the interiors come across as dark, overwhelming and provincial. The photographs viewable on Amazon are misleading because the interiors pictured are more simple, more modern, and brighter than most of those photographed in the book. I would take a long look at it in-store before investing if you prefer simple, classic design to stringently historical interiors. (Also, as an aside, the book seems to utilize an older understanding of acceptable paint colors for colonials-- darker, duller colors. Others, such as Martha Stewart's books, proclaim that newer research shows that slightly brighter shades were actually used more often than previously believed.)"
2,Agree with S. Haus,"I agree with S. Haus. I was also disappointed. The interiors of the homes in the book are generally dark and unwelcoming (unlike the one on the cover). I prefer the multitudes of other books that combine accurate colonial decorative schemes with a modern, lived-in feel, rather than something straight out of a tour of Benjamin Franklin's 18th century home. Not sure why some other reviewers seem to attack the S. Haus review; makes me wonder if they know the author personally."
5,Hands free for StarTec a 'Must' Buy!,"I received the Travelspeak Startec speaker phone as a gift and promply put it into the trunk of my car. Then I saw a TV show about the 'microwave' problems associated with using portable phones, i.e., the antenna emits harmful microwaves. I hooked up the phone the next day. I was amazed at the clarity of sound and the ease of 'hands free' operation. I wouldn't be without one now. It is a 'must' for anyone who frequently uses a phone in his/her car."
1,Wish I'd bought another kit,"The first unit I received arrived broken. The piece that plugs into the car cigarette lighter was in pieces when I took it out of the box for the first time. I sent it back and Amazon quickly sent me a replacent unit. This unit lasted for 3 days before the tip broke off when I tried to take it out of the cigarette lighter. To make matters worse, part of it remained stuck in the cigarette lighter, and I had a difficult time getting it out. It's hard to believe I could have the random bad luck to get 2 defective units within a weeks time, especially since they broke in the same manner. I suspect there's some manufacturing or design flaw with this product."
5,the best product ever,this product is so great. If you talk for long times or short times this product is good for anybody. It is also a neat gift to give to people for a special ocassion. BUY IT PEOPLE
5,Carl and Dennis are catching up with their big brother fast,Carl and the Passions is another lost masterpiece from the BBs. Man this album has soul. Carl is starting to really find his way here and it is the performance and best album of his entire career.Holland is very good also and contains a Brian Wilson concept about a magic transistor radio and it's strange but good.
4,Strong Beach Boy's 70's works,"If you like Beach Boys classic music from 63'- 66' (Cars, surfing) This might not be for you. The 70s saw the Beach Boys reaching and experimenting, not going for just the catchy pop single with astounding hooks, quick beats and signalong choruses. They were writing more mature adult music. There's still some 'fun' music but there's more ballads, social comentary alegory, searching songs etc. That said, The great musicianship of the members singing, writing, playing combined with production flourishes gives it the strength that it might otherwise be lacking due to Brian Wilson's minimal involvement. He just writes a song or two.. Some weak moments, but What's good is GREAT!"
4,"Bah, Critics","The Amazon reviewer, Jerry McCulley, either has a tin ear, or didn't bother to listen to So Tough before he wrote his review. (That's right, I said it!) Carl and the Passions - So Tough is a strong album, with beautiful songs (including little know Brian Wilson compositions) and great playing. As a long-time fan, I will agree that many of the Beach Boys albums of the 70's and 80's leave much to be desired, but neither Carl and the Passions nor Holland belong on that list. Ignore the critics and listen for yourself."
5,"5"" waves on the amazon","For those who unconsciously view the 'official' Amazon reviews as more fact-based than those in the consumer section, I feel compelled to say that the Amazon critic really missed the boat in regard to the 'Carl & The Passions - So Tough' portion of this package; if you're only interested in fun, fun, fun or Smile-style seriousness, perhaps this isn't for you. But if the South African curve of the Blondie-Ricky era intrigues you, I don't think you'll be disappointed by this collection.And though we may never hear Brian's ode-to-masseuse 'Marcella' in its original form, the 'clean' revision debuted on 'So Tough' is a splash of muscular pop perfection that even Noel Gallagher would love."
4,Full of Good Ideas,"Although this book is put out by Pottery Barn and probably every single page contains photos of items sold at Pottery Barn, the fact is that every page does offer innovative storage-solution ideas. I particularly liked the ideas for under-the-stairs and entryways and laundry rooms. Books such as this one are inspiring because you can look at a photo and immediately accept, adapt, or reject it for your own living quarters. It's the ""adapting"" part that's most fun -- using something you saw but changing it to meet your own needs or whims. This book is definitely worth consulting."
2,"Great book, bad condition","My review is based upon the receiving condition of the book, not the contents. The book itself is great. Beautiful pictures and great decorating inspiration. However, it is definitely a USED book. Cover is torn and the spine is scuffed. Looks like something from a yard sale."
3,OK,This one is ok but I don't care for it as much as I do the Halloween one - The Pumpkin That Couldn't Smile.It's a real cute one.
4,the more things change...,"By using modern language and references when possible, Mr Matthews has shown the timelessness of Martial's epigrams. Where Martial addresses a man who buried seven wives, Matthews offers: ""Sow the body, reap the estate: isn't agriculture grand?"" This could be the lead story in tomorrow's paper. If you haven't read the 100 epigrams since school days, here's your chance to pick up a handsome, and rather hip, copy."
2,This running board does NOT come with mounting brackets,"Christmas will be a little late for my husband, as the running board I ordered for his truck, although it arrived on time..did NOT have the mounting brackets included. Now I'm having a real problem trying to find some place to just purchase the mounting brackets...I may have to send the running boards back, wait for a refund, to go else where to purchase the complete kit! Very frustrating"
1,a reader,"He could have came more better than that and if you are a TRUE READER you would have know how it was going to end. It lacked character, was not well thought out, but I will give the author an A for trying. Lets hope his next book is better."
4,GOOD Page Turner!,"I was really into this book. I couldn't put it down and finished it on my 5 hour shift at work in between calls. It was alot shorter then I liked and I felt like the author could have really went far with this book and built on the characters and it really could have been captivating. It had a very intresting ending, so overall I was satisfied I just was hoping for more."
5,INTOXICATING AND VIVID!,"Dumb as me is filled with pages full of the most exciting literature anyone should desire!I simply could not put the book down once I started, the book is awesome!!!!"
3,Need to pay more attention.... Not so Good Book!!!,"I give this book 3 stars. I use to just read the reviews by real reviews of publishers. But, now have brought some of these novels and read them. I will read the customers reviews also, it would have saved me. Dumb as Me... Looks good on the outside the cover is nice and has and intersting story line to it, but was not well developed. Some other reviews said it great and wonderful, I know have a theory on that... their beginner reads. Recommend borrowing the book from the library."
2,"Please, Please, Please","Are you serious? Michael Gainer's book is shallow, predictable, and in need of serious editing. I give him props for giving women (and men) tips on the game and the fact that Keith learned his lesson in the end. However, this novel was not well written at all. Playa, please go back and learn the game of editing (or at least find someone who can do it for you)."
2,Save your $$ and time,"Poorly, poorly written. The cover is really nice, it caught my attention right away. However, once you get past the cover, there's really not much in between to keep your attention. If you must, borrow this one. Otherwise save your $$."
3,"""COAST2COASTREADER""",I ACTUALLY LIKED THIS BOOK. YES.. THE CHARACTER'S WERE UNDERDEVELOPED BUT WITH ANY TYPE OF IMAGINATION IT WASNT HARD TO PICTURE WHAT WAS GOIN ON
2,Nice Try for a First Book,"I read this book a while ago and I must say that I love the cover and the title. The storyline had a lot of potential but like so many others have said, the story was not flushed out enough and the characters were seriously underdeveloped. However, I do believe the author has potential so I have purchased his second novel and will see if there is a vast improvement. After all, we must all start somewhere and writing is about growth with each project. I think he has the ability to tell a better story but if you are just looking for a fast read to kill some time, this book is so-so."
5,one of my favorite books,This book is hands down one of my favorites originally read it back in 2004 and that instant I became a book lover..... A must read!
3,okay.....,i would recommend this book only if you need a fast read that's somewhat entertaining. If you're looking for something thought provoking; dont bother with this one.
3,Just O.K.,"After seeing this book on the internet for many months, I finally purchased it. I have to say, I was extremely dissapointed. It certainly did not live up to all the hype. The characters just did nothing for me! This not one of those books that make you want to read it again!"
2,DUMB AS ME FOR BUYING,"TO ME THIS WAS HORRIBLE. WHEN I GO TO BUY BOOKS OFF THE NET I ONLY LOOK AT HOW MANY STARS OTHER READERS GAVE, NOT THEIR COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO TELL THE STORY. IN THIS CASE I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS. THIS BOOK WAS VERY HORRIBLE. TOTALLY UNDEVELOPED, AND HAD NO DEPTH AT ALL TO THE STORY. THIS BOOK STAYED RIGHT ON THE SURFACE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A QUICK READ WHILE YOU WAIT ON THE DOCTOR THIS WOULD BE IT."
2,Not that great,"I thought that when I bought this book, that it'll be a good one...NOT!!! I gave it 2 stars because it was ok for a start, but I won't be buying any more of his books. I thought the chapters were too short and to the point. It was like ""I f'd her real good and I got outta there""...Next chapter. Then, the ending was just as ridiculous as the rest of the book. The other reason why I didn't enjoy this book, there were too many typos. I'm sorry, I'm all for supporting black owned publishing companies and all, but have better editors, I found sentences that were run-ons,words that were spelled wrong...Okay, listen, do not buy this book at all."
2,THANK GOD I BORROWED THIS BOOK,"Wasted time even finishing book....wanna be player finds playette girl, while cheating on his woman. Gets surpised in the end...you either seen this on BET or Lifetime movie of the week. Please! Glad I didn't buy this one."
2,Not All That !!!,"I only gave this book 2 stars because I actual finished reading it.This book was not at all a great read. I continued to read it only because I wanted to know what to happened next. There was no real plot or realism about this book, it just seem made up or something. The title says the same thing for me for buying this book!!!!!!!"
3,Something different...,"No real plot, not much character development. A fast, kick-around read that's interesting enough to keep you reading on to find out what is the point. What a twist at the end..."
3,Dumb As Me !!!!,"Dumb As Me for buying this book, when I should've borrowed it from the library. This book was OK (and by saying that I'm being nice!). The characters in the story were not developed. The only good thing I can say about the book was the plot was interesting!!!"
2,Not all that,"This book tricked me, it was horrible i was waiting for so much more to happen that never happened. It had alot of potential, but didn't follow through. Good Title, Bad Book. Like they say ""Never judge a book by it's cover""."
3,Ex - Crimso Archives,"McDonald & Giles has it's moments, but if the original Crimson had stayed together for at least another record I think it would have been much better than this duo's effort or Poseidon for that matter. The Epitaph box set and the Collectors Club Marquee Club show offer insight as to what the outcome may have been. Birdman is a quite repetive side long piece that drags this one down. Side one offers shorter pieces that are much more appealing. All in all it's better than Peter Sinfiled's 'Still', but not the best effort by ex- Crimso's."
2,Rubbish.,Any of King Crimson's studio recordings from the seventies are worth obtaining. This collaboration between Ian McDonald and the Giles brothers (all Crimson alums) is not. These normally inspired musicians (see early Crimson) sound dull and flacid here. The compositions are unfocused and uninteresting psychedelic nonsense. Nothing of much interest throughout. Even a cameo by Steve Winwood doesn't help much. Give this one a skip...Simon
1,WHO's idea was this?,"Im a big who fan and one of my favorite albums is the who sell out album. When i herd about this album i didnt know what to think. I was lent the album by a friend who didnt tell me what he though about it. I sat down and listened to the entire album and by the end i wanted to smash it up like pete would one of his guitars. It was apauling. Why she wanted to do this i dont know. Townshend probably agreed to this for some cash or a laugh, and he called it a ""fun project"". It wasnt fun for me to listen to. The original is a classic and ive listened to it many of times. I cringe when Petra tries to SING keiths drums and entwistles bass. Avoid if you want a life."
1,"Crap, crap, crap","For all you people who don't get out much, this album may seem chic and ""concept' to you but lemme tell you something... collegiate A cappella groups have been doing what she just did for decades and have been doing it BETTER... I was in a couple groups during my collegiate years and we could've blown the pants off her. If you want some REAL a cappella music I suggest you check out the BOCA series from the mainely a cappella catalog (unless amazon has it). Boca stands for Best of College A Cappella and let me tell you IT IS. This petra girl needs to get her head on straight cause he vocals are mediocre and the mix is terrible. This CD isn't worth the plastic its pressed on."
2,not so hot.,this is just another chick with no original songs of her own trying to ride on the coatails of a great band. a few songs were ok sounding but in all it's a weak attempt at a classic who lp. it also figures that this is the daughter of a famous composer. these people usually are related to someone in the biz who can easily get them studio time instead of a true talented unknown who will never get opportunities like this.
4,"It's a joke, but told well...","When I first heard the samples I did not know what to make of it. And it grew on me. You really need to pick up the original album if you do not have it already. Petra picked apart a lot of the structure of the music, songs and backgrounds and now I can hear things in the original that I just passed by. But that's her job. It will no doubt spawn many imitators, but this has gotten better on repeated listenings, along with more listens to the original."
2,"good coffee, not so good product","The coffee tasted much better in these, but:1. After two cleans, the top mica knob (I think it mica instead of glass) cannot screw back in any more.2. You have to dry inside the pot with paper towels or it will rust. I left my to dry by itself and rust start to show inside the pot.So after two used, I have to throw this out because of the rust and the bad knob."
3,Top clear PLASTIC knob top melts...,"Great pot ~ except for the clear PLASTIC knob on top. After two or three uses, the base of the knob melts during percolation and the knob cannot be used any longer. I contacted FARBERWARE Corporation for a glass replacement, but they do not offer one. Generic glass percolator tops do not fit. Purchased new plastic replacement tops from Farberware, but the same thing happened. That is the BIGGEST drawback with this percolator. Could be a potentially dangerous item. Top can come off while pouring coffee and someone could get scalded. Farberware didn't stand behind their product when I informed them of the problem."
4,percolator,"I'm really enjoying my new percolator. I would have liked knowing that the cover was attached to the main body of the percolator. It may indicate a weak spot. However, the quality is very good and the coffee has been delicious!!!!!!!"
2,"Side 1 Good; Side 2, Blah.","As is the case with the weaker McCartney albums, the first ""side"" (vinyl talk) is pretty good (up through the song ""So Bad""), and a seeming good follow up to the superb ""Tug of War"". But Side 2 falls apart, sounding like a bunch of throwaways. George Martin should have recognized this, and told him to go back and write better songs to complete the record. Apparently, he didn't. Let's give it 2 1/2 stars."
2,Worst of McCartney,"I am a huge Paul McCartney fan, but this album is just terrible. This was the last Paul McCartney album I didn't have and I wish it had stayed that way. Maybe there are a few okay songs on here but really it is the worst he has ever done. A lot of his albums have some weak songs on them but this takes the cake. It is a pain to listen to and get through. I would still buy this CD, but not until after getting every other Paul and Wings CD. They are all better then this...."
3,Peaced Together Album,"Pipes Of Peace is a decent collection of songs. There are two duets with Michael Jackson, the monster hit ""Say Say Say"" which is a bouncy piece of ear candy that spent six weeks at number one and is Mr. McCartney's last chart topper and lesser known, but still good ""The Man"". ""So Bad"" is a good mid-tempo song with Mr. McCartney affecting a high falsetto. The title track is the best song on the album. It is a perfect piece of pop production that only George Martin could oversee. Unfortunately, the rest of album is throwaway material that is mostly forgettable."
4,Cozy blinds,"Color was lighter than pictures. Very smooth operation with a solid/strong feeling.Sunlight still enters but this gives an oriental atmosphere.I'm glad that I ordered 3 of these. Well packed with hooks, screws and clear instructions.Was shipped quickly."
1,Inferior Quality,"As soon as I opened the box, one cord came off the end connection bead and everything was one tangled mess. It took about 20 minutes to untangle the cords. Then I had to study how the thing worked and re-string the cord that was loose. It was a nightmare. I would not recommend this product unless you have a lot of patience."
5,a must for lazy people,"i love my dock, nice advances from the older models; lean toward Kodak cameras due to their excellent docks & ease of transferring pictures"
4,"Bought on a whim, pleasantly surprised.","Lately I've been looking for lesser known artists and less conventional music- A Band of Bees (or The Bees as they're known in Europe) fit the bill perfectly. They remind me a little of The Who. I read somewhere that the two singles on the album are ""Listening Man"" and ""Who Cares What the Question Is"", but I personally enjoy the more subtle, cool beat of ""Got to Let Go"" the most. However, there is not a single bad song on this album, though after the fourth track the songs get a little less than astounding until they pick back with the ninth track, ""Hot One!"", and goes out with a bang with the track ""End of the Street"". Anyone who is a fan of psychedelic rock, or just looking for a band who knows how to hold your ear, check this album out."
4,Mardi Gras and Carnival.....,"The sounds of the bees second disc takes me away. Sounds of carnivals or mardi gras waft and wane.This is a very pleasant disc to listen to, and given the right frame of mind, it can be almost epic.There are few bands that conjure up the 60's and 70's the way that the bees do. The harmonies are stellar, and the songwriting is a hippies delight.I would be hard pressed to find a reason why most peole wouldn't flip out for this release.Do yourself a favor and check out the new Coral disc (roots & echos). they are right there with the bees.Exhale and enjoy."
5,EXCELLENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!,awesome band....sounds different than everyone else !so great to chill out to :)
1,Savage Mistake,"I read this book when I was new to romance reading and it's a wonder I kept reading the genre after this. The research ishalfbacked, the plot ridiculous, the heroine a twit, thehero a jerk....don't waste your time."
1,Savage Heat,"I have read alot of books this one has to be one of the worst books I have read. It used words I know that were never used in the old west. white showdow finds he has a half brother that was taken away from his mother at birth and this brother is a bigot of the worst kind, he has lived with the whites for 30 years. His Indian mother kidnaps him and in a matter of a week or two he does a total about face he now loves the indians, excepts that he is half indian, he never tries to escape and he just excepts it all. Please give me a break. I was so glad to be done with this book. It is the fist of her books I have read and I don't know that I will try anymore anyone who can give this book a good review hasn't read any really good books."
3,Relatively Decent,"A serviceable mix suitable for several types of aerobics-based classes, e.g hi-lo, kickbox, step. It has some good grooves and the transitions are smooth and relatively easy to cue with. The actual music's a bit dated."
2,Mucho ruido y pocas nueces,"Penoso. Este lamentable intento de rendir tributo a Neruda carece de todo merito musical (la música de fondo solo consigue hacer el texto ininteligible) y artístico (los interpretes que leen los poemas, en general, demuestran ser incapaces de capturar el ritmo maravilloso de Neruda). Lo único valioso de este adefesio son los breves fragmentos en que se oye a Neruda recitando.Consejo: Trate de escuchar a Neruda en su forma original: La voz tranquila y cadenciosa del poeta es el mejor camino para llegar a su mundo."
5,"Hermoso, profundo y único...","Para empezar es Neruda. Con eso basta. Para terminar, están las voces que tocan el alma, como Nascimento, Sabina, Echeverry, Sanz, Bosé, Cuevas, Fher.... la música es increíble. Me tocó el alma y no falla. Poesía alucinante, creatividad e inspiración para vivir. Cómprenlo."
4,This book turned out to be very useful,"I've been an endurance trial runner for many years but after a stress-related leg injury took me off the circuit a friend of mine bought this book for me as a joke. Common sense may be a luxury but at least we can buy it in the nearest bookstore. Technique was my problem...and probably shoes too. And I laughed while a learned. The marathon veteran that wrote the book gives a few antidotes as to the progression of Runner culture through the decades. (I'm so happy we runners have gotten past the leotard, spandex-wearing, hairy,shirtless Mr. America jogger years) I'm happy to report that I've been back in the woods and running my normal pace for a month now after Way Too Long Off. This book was very helpful in my recovery."
5,Arctic Weather Bag,"If you're looking for a bag that you can weather an arctic storm in then this is the bag you're looking for. I was backpacking along the Candadian border in the Idaho panhandle in mid/late October and this bag was way too warm. Temperatures were only in the teens (F) and 20s. If, like me, you've owned other negative-degree rated bags and found the ratings to be dubious don't make that mistake with this bag. When it says -15 it MEANS that you can sit outside in -15 F temperatures and be warm and toasty inside this bag. My entire trip I slept with the bag wide open and I was still hot! Great buy though. Having, in the past, violently shivered an entire night through in white out conditions at 10,000 ft., I would trust this bag in any such conditions. Definitely NOT a summer bag though. Bottom line - if you want to have an impressive winter bag that you can trust in extreme conditions then this bag works great and the price is incredible. Cheers."
2,Not essential at all,"The authors try hard but end up writing what is unintentionally hilarious. Actually has sections like what ""the properly dressed leather man wears."" Meant to be helpful, it ends up being immediatedly dated and campy."
1,THIS IS NOT BIG YOUTH!,Do not be confused. I do not know why this is listed under Big Youth but Abdel Halim Hafez is not a reggae artist and does not have red green and gold jewels in his front teeth. watch it!
5,Great Gift for Mom,"I bought this vest for my mom for Christmas last year and she loves it. In fact, she still thanks me for it every time she wears it. I wish I had bought one for myself!"
1,Fraudulent company,"This product very clearly states it comes with SIXTEEN of these bricks of hermit crab soil. It even says the retail price is $27 and you will save $25.75. So I ordered two sets of sixteen and instead only received two discs. After paying for shipping, this was a rip off! It would have been way cheaper at a local pet store. Not happy with this seller and won't buy from them again."
2,Doesnt tickle me,I thought it was to small and i didnt care to much for the texture it was to soft and it had a strong smell most of the time i dont mind the plasticy smell but this made my whole room smell horrible.
2,Doc Johnson Savanna G-Spot Tickler,"Terrible! Unless your clitoris and vagina are *extremely* close together, this isn't going to do it for you. At all. My husband and I tried a number of different configurations, and all this toy did was irritate my urethra and completely kill the mood.It isn't even effective as a g-spot stimulator; the material is too soft and pliable to apply the necessary pressure.The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is that the bullet--unlike the attachment--is not *completely* useless. It is, however, a little weak, and not best quality (the chrome finish started chipping off pretty much immediately). The controller is sturdy and easy to use, and I like the thin, flexible cord, but...well...these features do not a good sex toy make.Don't waste your money."
3,Just not enough,The product is okay as long as its not your only toy. Its a greet clit stimulator but is to short for a good g-spot vibration.
3,Smelly,"This has an AWFUL skunk smell. The toy is fun.. no doubt. All things considered an awesome toy, but.. that SMELL!!You can use soap and water... alcohol.. vibe washes... NOTHING works. It's some coating cause at first even handling it makes your hands smell.. and it fades a bit but sticks with the toy. They REALLY need to figure out what it is and change it. It's enough to make you want to stop using it! I don't know if I want to risk this manufacturer's other similar products because of this smell...."
1,Too Small and No Power,"My wife was not impressed at all with this unit. It does smell as mentioned in another review and the unit also does not have enough power to do anything for her. I would suggest looking elsewhere if power of the vibrator is important, G-Spot or not."
3,Its ok,"Overall, it has a nice little ""buzz"" to it, and I like the feel and shape of it...not to mention the little ""tongue"" to stimulate the g-spot. However, much smaller than I thought--and sometimes it stimulates the g-spot too much! But, considering the price, its not too bad."
3,Look around,"It was much smaller than expected and did have a terrible odor to it. The tip could have a little more vibration to it, but overall its ok."
4,Caresses both of your hottest spots,"See my review for the Doc Johnson Savanna. It's the same product, just a different color. And it feels MAH-VELOUS, DAHLING! [I like it, anyway.]"
2,Sorry I ordered it,"This product definitely smells horrible! It's smaller than I expected.. not even really long enough to reach the right place inside. Also, it's made of very flimsy jelly-ish material. Like other reviews have stated, we ended up removing the attachment and kept only the vibrating part."
3,This is very small.,so small in fact that It didnt do at all what I intended it to do.. I wound up just removing the bullet and putting the squishy thing in my drawer.. but I must say.. that bullet is allot of fun :-D
1,never received,i never received this product. UPS stated that they delivered it and I signed for it but that is a lie. I called amazon and they said their computers were down and could not help me.
2,Boring,"How can I say this...I was so exited to get this toy until I gave it a test drive and it did nothing all that exiting. It didn't hit any G spot of mine, and the clitoral stimulation it gives is less than amazing. My own fault for not doing my reasearch correctly maybe and seeing that the thing was only as long as my fingers lol."
1,Very low power...........,"I have used this once. The power is non-existent......maybe for someone who is brand spanking new to using vibrators it may be enough, but not for me. Usually if a toy doesn't have enough power it makes up for it in texture, etc. This one is sooooooooooooooooooooo soft that I can't even get anything from the actual toy itself. *sigh* Not Doc's best product...... :o("
2,Smells horid,The plastic smell is overwhelmingly awful. It even stinks up the drawer its kept in.There has to be something better than doesn't smell revolting.
1,not worth the price,totally useless...not worth the money at all..very small..best thing for orgasm in my opinion is hitachi magic wand..this was a waste of money and time..no instructions at all.
1,a waste of time,"This product didn't do a thing for me. It's small, the vibration wasn't even stimulating. I would have to say you are better off going solo."
2,0-10 in 5 seconds and not in a good way really,"I bought this thinking that it's design would be great and hit the spot. I've gotten more use out of the sheath alone then with whole thing. The vibrating egg vibrates too much and you cant really adjust the speed. It's either on full speed ahead or it's off. There is no real adjustable control range like there should be. And when the thing is on full speed, it vibrates so badly that I cant enjoy the gentle message that I'm supposed to get and it's so annoying that I just give up on trying and just use the sheath.Oh and it does have a strange smell at first but it does seem to go away."
1,Waste of money,"I did not purchase my G-spot tickler on amazon.com, but I do have the exact same one and same color that is display on this site. I was excited before using it...until I open up the package. I like everyone said, it has a very bad odor that soap and water can not take away. The toy did nothing for me at all. The bullet is the best part, but you will not no feel it vibrating because the bullet is at the base not the tip. Using the bullet will work just fine without the rubber ""So-Called"" tickler."
3,You only get what you give,"A really good product for the price. It's very small and somewhat pliable, but it forces you to use your pelvic floor muscles to achieve orgasm. It does smell somewhat, but is fairly quiet and the hand held control is a nice feature. This product won't change your life, but is a nice addition to your collection."
2,Good book for marcom professional,"Book has a very interesting name and for some point book does fulfill expectations but... book is too much trying to find relevance for marketing function not to explain the relevance of marketing in corporate environment...book is written in a way ""marketing for dummies""... CRM is explained as a IT tool to develop internal processes with IT... brand and customers/customer relationships are separeted too much... every page has too many times word selling (push approach) not customer's buying (pull approach) So the total approach of the book in not very modern.Book is a good starting point for a marcom professional who would like to be a marketing professional. I find the book useful to myself when I have to explain what is marketing for a production oriented person."
4,A must-read for sales & marketing pros!,"As CMO of a mid-sized company, I personally hand this book out to every new sales and marketing employee -- a company bible, so to speak. This should be required reading to help companies drive sales and deliver on ROI."
5,For Women too,"This stuff is absolutely the BEST smelling cologne on the market, I wore this for years....until a couple years ago, when it got a little expensive...to where I couldn't get any longer.....now I see it's alot cheaper here on amazon....will definitely start buying again...."
4,Another world,"4 songs, each on average 30 minutes long. Although the first song is rather stagnant, each of the other tunes follows a call-and-response structure, and runs through various maqamat (middle-eastern ""scales""). I'm completely clueless to what 70-year old Ahmed is singing about. But, in enjoying the music, it is irrelevant. He is purportedly the greatest munshid in Egypt, and sings with stifling tonality. The vocals are accompanied by the Oud (Arabian fretless lute), Ney (Egyptian flute), Daf (large frame drum), tabla/darbukkah (Djembe-shaped drume), and Riq (tamborine). As each song usually goes through a process of picking up the tempo and intensity towards the end, it is easy to see how people succumb to a trance-like state induced by the hypnotic rhythm."
1,cr@p phone,"this is the worst phone I have ever purchased...handset no longer works after only 4 monthsanswering machine records so quietly that you cant hear your messagessomething funky with the cord, sometimes people can hear mesometimes they cantif a I could find the receipt Id return itI considered buying another and returning this one in the box with the receipt but not only would that be dishonest, I would end up with another of the same kind of phoneit is absolute cr@p! One star is too many."
2,Kitchen Phone Evaluation,"This is a very good phone except when you use the wall mount feature, the handset can be knocked off the base station too easily. We use it in the kitchen and it is very satisfactory except the occasional drop to the floor when grazed by a passing elbow. The product could be improved greatly by making the handset more stable with a larger hook.Had a previous model of this phone, and frequent drops made hand set inoperable and manufacturer does not sell replacement handsets."
2,Wouldnt Purchase Again,"Received on time - connected - the phone worked for awhile, but not the best signal - static was frequent - would not purchase this again."
4,Got plenty of time to spend playing?,"Then this 2 games are for you, the #-D pinball a=will keep you scoring till the dark hours, never gets boring and it is very challenging at the higher levels. If you like card games, you will take on this table. Cards galore, very amusing and entertaining. PLUS you actually get 2 cd games for the price of one! I say an excellent deal!"
3,just plastic with copper colored paint,"This is a very pretty set. It is not made of copper or even a copper colored metal. They are lightweight plastic and seem to be painted with a copper colored paint. The top of the salt shaker was broken off when I received it - I ended up gluing it back on (couldn't return it as I had misplaced the receipts etc.) and it has been functional since. I've had them for 6 months now, used regularly, and the painted finish is still pretty and not wearing off. It definitely does not have the weight of a stainless metal set, so even though it is pretty & seems to be lasting (with glue!) it feels ""cheap"" in the hand."
3,A mediocre attempt,"I am afraid I cannot share the enthusiasm of the above reviwer. I will admit the only track that remains in my memory is the opening tune 'Falling', which although is a very authentic sample of the psychedelic style of the time ('68), seems to be the only one that fits that description.The only other tracks I recall are 'That's the Way Love Is', and The Everly Brother's 'Birddog'. This did not recieve any significant airplay, and certainly could not stand up against their contemporaries such as The Electric Prunes or Iron Butterfly. If I recall the liner notes well, they were from the Forest Hills NY area, home to the Ramones. If you guys are still out there, think about a reunion!"
4,Color Recipes 2,"The book contains just what it says, color recipes. It is great for the novice in determining a great color mixture for fruits, glass, sunsets, snow., portraits, etc. She also gives some compositional tips for creating beautiful paintings."
1,False,"The warren Report is wrong. It was George Warren Hickey Jr. sole assasin is wrong. good book, wong answer."
1,A Lie from Start to Finish,"This is the kind of book that shows you how NOT to do a serious investigation. There are many gaps in the report. I read all the volumes of the Warren Commission, and I tell you: most of the evidence are completely irrelevant, there are many obvious gaps that should have been questioned by the report, many important witnesses were not called to testify, etc. This shows you, you can't believe everything you read from the Federal Government. I was extremely disappointed with this report."
2,Dry lie,"Steadfast in my belief that LHO was 100% innocent, I read the original 1964 edition of this book. It served to further cement my belief that Lee Harvey Oswald did not pull that trigger, and is yet another example of the government making it painfully obvious that their lone gunman theory doesn't hold water and that Oswald was a patsy.While it was interesting to read about exactly how the Warren Commission intended to prove that Oswald was guilty, the book was not presented in an easy-to-read manner, nor did it have any rhyme or reason to it. There is probably a reason for that."
3,The warren commision report,"Hi! I get this book only a week a go,it took long time to come,but good that isnow here,thanks."
4,The Warren Commission made mistakes but...,"...they were pointed in the right direction. Instead of miscalculated blunders like conspiracy theorists, the government DID try to get it right. Most of the others are in it for the money and fame rather than the truth. Not perfect but 4.5 stars."
3,A good album,I don't really care for Bizkit but I did like the stuff they played on the radio. Yes I did hear their albums. This is a good greates hitz album from the band. Not great but still has some good songs like faith and my favorite build a bridge. It's cool to hear it if you don't have anything to hear and just want to hear something to kick back to or jam. For all the bizkit fans why are you so worried what other people say. If they diss this band so what that ain't going to stop you from buying their album. People have the feedom to say whatever they want. If they want to waste their time dissing the band let them you can't stop them. People like to talk smack about Korn but I don't care because I know they're cool.
3,Sure all the singles are on here--but many are EDITS,"If you are a casual fan of Limp Bizkit and were just hoping to have all the big singles that used to be on TRL and stuff on one disc, this CD comes as a disappointment. At least HALF the songs on here are significantly shorter than on the actual CDs they come from, starting with the first big huge tracks, Counterfeit, Faith and Nookie, which, if you look on itunes, are each listed as the ""greatest hits"" versions, which I assume means edits so that they could fit more songs on one disc. Too bad. This could have been a convenient way to get all the complete versions of theirs songs on one disc so you wouldn't have to buy each individual CD."
2,2 1/2,"Limp Bizkit is a band that all us Metal Heads really love to hate, but they arent that bad, just way to freakin over-rated. I have no idea what the hell what the deal with their guitar player wearing that stupid mask was all about, and he really isnt that good, so when he left, I wonder why fans thought it was the end of the world. They have some cool songs here, but once again, nothing special, and Fred Durst is an freaking idiot, but if you look past that, you might find some of the material enjoyable, but once again, there are way better things to listen to then this, so I really only recomend it if you are in the mood for some ""pop"" hard rock."
3,It feels like ive been mislead,"God told the Isralites ""Thou shall not have no other gods before me."" and Fred Durst says he is a king of allah a arabian god that didnt exist......but was a god of war just like limpbizkit is a king of nookie....overall the songs are ok...its a alright album"
1,My conversation with Fred Durst,"Me: Hey fred, I have some good newsFred:What? Im running out of money and I need it badly, so you helped me stqay back in my gold mansion where I can live lavishly by destroying metal?Me: NO, But I saved 100 dollars on my car insurance by switching to Geico!Speaking of which, Geffen wants your money. Don't give it to them."
1,why they still alive?,"Why they dont dissapier ! They suck ass as musicians, Fred Durst its a full of EGO he thinks they are the heaviest band alive but they are nothing. Please stop making records !"
3,plz........,Alot of you seem to think this albumn is childish and not heavy meatal and its just for kids.... then dont listen too it plain and simple. just dont buy the albumn. dont spend the day writing crappy reviews complaining about
1,"Hi, I'm Fred Durst. I need your money.","That is the meassage that I am receiving when I think of Limp Bizkit releasing any material in this day and age. Face it, Limp Bizkit was never a good band and a ""Greatest Hitz"" compilation from them is worth d*ck now that nu-metal is thankfully dead. Save your cash."
5,Worth owning.,"This is a cool CD. My favorites are Nookie, Break Stuff, Rollin', Faith, and Boiler. The one thing I will say is there's nothing off of TUT1, but I can easily get over that. What is here is basically all of the ""hitz"" and 3 new songs. I like Why and the mix-up of Home Sweet Home and Bittersweet Symphony, and Lean On Me is alright, I guess.Anyway, you should buy this album if you like the songs. It's as simple as that!Recommended!"
1,Fredz Fudge Factory,"I think Fredz Fudge Factory would have been a more fitting name for this band. Let's face it, they were absolute crap from day 1, and every day following that it just got worse.Nu metal is just pitiful. A bunch of white guys jumping around trying to look tough (that's right Fred Durst...no one thinks you're a bad ass) and act like they're black. STUPID!I was happy to see this compilation released though. It meant that we could officially write these turds off and see what media creation MTV would come up with next.Ding dong nu metal is dead! CLICK CLICK BOOM!"
5,Quit hatin,"I like alot of rap music but I like tha Nu metal stuff. My friends and I usually blast music on my stereo winever we hang out. My dog rich told me to play this CD and I waz like, this s*** wack. He says it's cool they have Method man on here. I decided to play it. At first i waz wonderin bout this, then all the sudden I'm blarin this s*** so loud i thought it'd blow the f*ckin speakers up. So I go out to buy the album a few days later. Some dude told me that Limp sux, I go f*** U, this CD is off the chain. Rap & Metal are a perfect mixture. My favorite song on here was either Nookie or Rollin. Buy tha album, it's worth tha money."
1,"Significantly Destroying the Art of Music, One Album at a time.","Seriously, why would anyone buy an album from someone who doesn't know how to spell ""Hits""? Or for that matter, names his songs ""N 2 gether now"" and ""Break Stuff"" For best results, play with volume turned way down."
1,"Thanks for f#$^ing Behind Blue Eyes, guys!!!","I would probably ignore Limp Bizkit if it weren't for their butchering of Behind Blue Eyes. But because of what they did to it, I will have them for the rest of my life. Did I mention that Fred Durst is an idiot? Oh, by the way Nookie sucks too. Next!"
2,Greatest hits are for when Musicians want to make more money without doing any work,"I like a lot of Limp Bizkit music, but still I'd rather spend an eternity hanging out with Carrot Top than spend a day hanging out with Fred Durst. (Now thats saying something) Sometimes Durst just needs to shut up!There are many bands out there who's frontman has died. (Nirvana, Sublime, ect) Normally when that happens the band gets more respect and people start wearing shirts with dead rockstars on them. However I honestly feel that if Fred Durst were to die no one would care. I'm not saying I want him dead. I'm just saying you wouldn't see any Durst T Shirts at hot topic. Maybe a dvd documentary about him in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-mart, but thats about it.Other than that, if you don't have any of the previous Bizkit albums then you should by the hits."
3,I wouldnt say greatest,"I wouldnt call this a greatest hits, more of a example of how they have changed over the years. This album would of been a good one if it included these 2:Cambodia - song from Family Values 98, turned into Show Me What You Got with just different lyrics.Crack Addict - the live one from Wrestlemania uneditedAlso more songs from 3 Dollar Bill Yall since theres still LB fans out their that dont even know that album exists. At least one of the new songs is decent."
4,Career Saver er what career?,"After the disastrous Hog Dog Lp & Results may vary (with Fred's lame attempt at a cd design), and their once over marketed career was taking a huge nose dive, this was a appropriate cd to release, just to remind fans of what a power house they once were, and what the F**K is with the cd cover? Fred! please! take a course in Adobe illurstrator & photoshop, before you do yourself an injury..."
1,...................,AH HAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA HAAAA HA HA HA HA HA {deep breath} HOOOOOOOOO.Ah ha. Ah ha hahahahahah HA HA HA HA HA HAAHHHHH HAAAAAAA HAAAAA HAAAAAA HAAAA HAAAAAA HA HA HA!Oh boy.
3,The new songs suck,"Was Fred Durst a great lyricist and vocalist? Nope. Was Wes Borland an innovative guitar player? Not even close. But for fifteen minutes sometime in the 90's, we were all picking up what they we're putting down, and we loved every minute of it. There are only one or two good songs on each Limp Bizkit album anyway, so now you can have them all on one disc. The new songs suck."
3,NOT A BAD COMPILATION,"WHEN I SEE GREATEST HITS COMPILATIONS I ALWAYS SEE SONGS THAT I COULD HAVE ADDED TO THE MIX, BUT HEY WHAT CAN YOU DO? I DIDN'T BUY THIS BECAUSE I HAVE ALL THE ALBUMS SO IT IS A WAISTE OF MONEY FOR ME. I COULD PUT TOGETHER MY OWN HITS COLLECTION LIKE I HAVE BEEN DOING FOR MANY OTHER ARTISTS. IM WORRIED ABOUT THE STATE OF LIMP BIZKIT. HOPEFULLY THEY WILL PUT OUT A REGULAR ALBUM NEXT TIME AND MARKET IT SO IT WILL DO WELL. NEXT ALBUM WILL DECIDE WHETHER THEY ARE FINISHED OR NOT AND YOU PEOPLE KNOW IT. THEIR LAST ALBUM FLOPPED, BUT IT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY DIDNT MARKET IT AND IT ONLY HAD SEVEN TRACKS AND SOLD FOR THE PRICE OF A REGULAR LP."
2,Hits?,Do they even deserve a greatest hits.They only have 6 hits(which are hardly good).Anyway i dont really like like them but i do have three dollar bill and weres sour or faith?
2,Neo tech tuba strap,"While the strap is well-made and carries the weight of the horn (for a little while), it comes with no pictures or instructions on how to set it up. Included are a mulititude of straps with no readily discernible purpose, but you're entirely on your own when it comes to setting it up. Also, once I adjust the strap for holding the horn in playing position, the straps gradually creep away from that setting, which means during a gig or concert I have to reset the straps three or four times. It actually becomes easier (when sitting) to simply forego the strap and just hold the horn. Additionally, the item's price is, in my opinion, way out of line for what you get and how it performs. I am not impressed, will never buy another and do not recommend this item for the reasons noted above."
4,Great piece of equipment,"I love using my harness. It allows me to focus on my playing rather than holding the instrument.It's a little tricky to figure out how to hook it up, and doesn't come with a good set of directions. Personally I have used it on my school's horn, which is a Meinl Weston BBb 25 model and what I found best is to take the strap with the soft fabric around it, and loop that around the bottom most bend and hook it on to the harness and take the small loop with the clip and loop it around one of the top tubes and then just ajust everything so it fits right. It's taken a while to get everything where I like, but now I have no problem with standing and playing when I need to. A great purchase for anyone doing a lot of standing performances!"
5,Great Harness,"I had been using a single strap for my 5/4 Tuba, this strap evened the weight between both sholders and was easy to use. I love it."
4,"A cheap, and GOOD phone!","This phone would rate 5 stars, except that the volume control doesn't raise the volume noticeably. The sound quality is excellent, however. In fact, I keep replacing our other land phones with this model."
2,Display is bad,The display is just bad. You cannot see the numbers you type or the caller Id's number. Otherwise the phone works. It's cheap.
1,Cordless Phone has problems,This phone had all the features I was looking for but had a alot of static in the line. I tested other Jacks and cords in the house and it still had noise. I've purchased another phone (Radio Shack) and it works perfectly.
3,Ok for the price,"I bought this as an emergency phone as my cordless died and didn't want to pay much for a new one. I got it a sale at a local store for 14.99- my only issue is the volume does not go loud enough. Not that I am hard of hearing, but if anything is going on in the background it makes it really hard to hear the person on the other end."
2,GE Cordless,"Display is hard to read (no brightness nor contrast controls). Product not recommended for cold weather (i.e., in a garage). Menu items confusing."
2,ge phone,it looks nice but the caller id is too something to read it right off. the phone also sounds hollow sometimes and does not automatically change channels so that does not happen. For the money it would be a good phone for the garage or the basement but not for everyday use.
4,Sound of silence,"Silent music has more impact than irritating noise. Silence is what I miss most in popular music. It makes it possible for music to breathe, like leaving out paint on a painting can create the illusion of light.These guys realize this and make real different, interesting European pop."
4,Really cool dark deck,"This deck has some of the most striking art work of any deck I've come across. Very gothic. Some of the cards such as the Moon are very beautiful. Even the stranger cards like the alien-elven fellow in the Magician really ""work."" There are only a few cards that I haven't gotten used to. Not recommended as a first deck. Learn on a Waite-Rider clone first."
3,Tarot deck with a story....,"The reader is introduced into a different universe via the ""story"" the artist created to go with the card art. I think this is a really cool idea, and although the artist's story plot is the archetypal fool's journey, it is told in a unique way.As with all Lo Scarabeo decks, the art is lovely. My biggest complaint about this - and all other Lo Scarabeo decks, for that matter - are the card borders. I understand that Lo Scarabeo is an Italian company; so it makes sense an Italian translation would be available on all the card packs they produce. But I hate how they always include the Italian AND the English AND the French AND the Spanish translation of the card names on the borders of the cards. This seriously cuts down the size of actual picture shown on the card, and in my opinion is unnecessary.Otherwise the deck is easy to understand and accessible for all level readers. I really liked the court cards, and I especially found the Queen of Wands to be intriguing."
3,"good, but not original","I Read this book,nothing against the author nor questioning his knowledge, just wanted to comment on his literary work,The ideas presented are borrowed from Wei Wu Wei, the master, the writing style I felt are his, so I felt it lacked the punch.If you really want to feel the punch try Wei Wu Wei.His books blow you off, that kind of punch is lacking in this book, all the time I was comparing Balsekar's style with the master's(Wei Wu Wei) writing style.Wei Wu Wei's Creativity, style, the words are so strong that once I read this book,I felt as if I just completed another book that's all."
2,Piece of junk,"Hate to say it but we have had 2 of these in two years. The glider mechanisim keeps falling apart. It squeeks loudly and grinds. I weigh 200 lbs. Shouldn't be too much to ask for with an expensive glider.Also the fabric is not scotch guarded, so it stains very easy. Not good for a baby chair. These are made in Canada in a French area. Customer service is boarderline rude and short with you, because you don't understand the Thick french accent. I doubt I will ever buy another Shermag product."
5,OUR DESERT ISLAND CHOICE!,"MY WIFE AND I AGREE THAT IF WE COULD TAKE ONLY ONE DISC TO A DESERT ISLAND WITH US, IT WOULD BE THIS ONE (ALTHOUGH I WOULD MISS A BEETHOVEN'S 9TH AND A FEW OTHERS!)HE 'OWNS' DANNY BOY AND THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER HAS EVEN GREATER POIGNANCY NOW THAT IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH HIS FATHER'S AND MOTHER'S RECENT DEATH.THERE IS NO MORE HEART-FELT TENOR IN THE WORLD.A MUST ON ANY IRISH MUSIC LOVER'S LIST!"
3,made me smile but did not really enlighten,this book is ok...that's about as far as i would go. there were some interesting quirks but i felt this was all too shallow.it did provide some interesting cocktail banter and it does give value for money.you'll finish it within half an hour and forget it under your bed.
3,Stocking Stuffer,"I gave it as a gift for Christmas, but looked through it briefly. It looked pretty interesting."
2,"Well made, but not entirely accurate","Make no mistake; this is a well-made piece of work. The stories flow smoothly, and the illustrations are very nice. However, the facts just haven't been checked. It claims (incorrectly) that Coca-Cola was an accident, it states (falsely) that Cinderella originally wore fur slippers instead of glass, and it actually elaborates with no real evidence on the history of the brick. For these reasons, I don't recommend it; if you really enjoy it and want to, check everything at snopes.com, where facts are checked ruthlessly."
4,lots of fun for bongo players !!,"I had purchased a meinl abs set of bongos which are excellent. So, I really liked the quality of meinl bongos so when I saw these bongo cajons I was curious to check them out. Good reviews all over the net and you tube had some video of people playing them. I got my own set of these and they are very nice and awesome to play! Quality siam oak drums, with no screws or nails which is nice. The tones are sweet and they are very fun to play. Very good price to boot so I say, get these asap, durable, nice looking, and great tone! No worries about tuning the heads or breaking a head which can be expensive on regular bongos!"
4,A very fun little box,"If you are looking for a cheap(er) alternative to a good set of bongoes, this might be it; however, the feeling you get is not the same. Still, I think its better than buying a cheap set of Bongoes, specially to the beginner as no tuning nor maintenance is necessary.Once you pick this cajon up, it will be hard to let it go."
4,Love these shoes!,"I purchased these shoes because I'm going to be going on trip soon where I'll be required to dress nicely more often than not. I wanted cute, but comfortable shoes. I was overjoyed when I received them! They are adorable and I've worn them out on the town a few times to break them in and I cannot imagine going back to uncomfortable, although cute, shoes again. They're just what I've been searching for!"
5,Edge-of-the-seat suspense!,"I was riveted by Dean Barrett's portrayal of the tensions, and excitement, of the East-West interchange. Beautiful writing, and edge-of-the-seat suspense kept me anxious to the finsh.Sujata Masseyauthor of The Bride's Kimono"
2,awesome,finnaly the great songs of the best death metal band in the world. I listen to this cd over and over
5,A Personal & Musical Understanding,"I am amazed that there wasn't more buzz about this truly insightful account of the final tour of the great Maria Callas. Robert Sutherland is a first rate musician and accompanist with an insider's view to the struggle that plagued Maria Callas during those turbulent and triumphant concerts(44 in all)worldwide. He ate, slept, and lived with Callas and DiStefano through the agony and ecstacy that each performance heaped on this trio, soprano, tenor, and accompanist. I read the entire book in 24 hours, I could not put it down.My supreme satisfaction came when I finally got to meet Robert Sutherland at the moving tribute that was staged at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on the anniversary of Maria Callas' death.For Callas fans, opera fans, and those interested in the backstage goings on of singer's tours, this is a ""must""."
5,Better than thin book on appreciative inquiry if you can believe it,I love this book! Simple and powerful and ever so relevant. This is a must read for anyone involved in organizational or community change. You can create healing and remove the hidden agenda's that prevent you from moving ahead. Clear and powerful work with outstanding examples. A must read.
2,Not special enough,"Important subject, but I do not find this book neither thorough nor providing good overview of the subject.The book is about big communication problems in organizations, and it is interesting enough in it self.The graphic design, inclding fonts, colors and paper quality, is horrible, though still readable."
2,Leah D.,The instructions with this were the worst I have seen in years. The pieces difficult to pound into place and the illustrations made it impossible to know if you had the piece correctly placed until you added the last piece 45 minutes later. It was really frustrating to put together the first time - and then only to find out that it was put together incorrectly when pounding on the last piece. A great price - and look is good but the quality of product and the frustration in construction would have had me send it back if it wasn't such a bulky item. Would not purchase again.
5,"A ""must have"" for parents of Special Education Children.","This book will become the ""bible"" for parents of Special Education children. The book is wirtten with the lay person in mind in a clear and concise manner. The whole IEP process is spelled out in easy to follow steps that gently glides one through the process. The letters and forms which can be copied or added to are invaluable, and take a giant step toward helping parents become effective advocates for their children. A copy of the law IDEA 1997 is included, giving full disclosure to the general public. The information included in this book can save a parent thousands of dollars in attorney's fees. If you buy just one book about Special Education this year, this should be the one!"
5,"A Parents God sent, a prayer answered!","I was saying to myself, as I drove to Nolo Press. They must write a book, we need something from a non-school prospective. Parents need their children & their issues addressed by some concerned party. The clerk had just put the book on the shelf about twenty minutes before I walked in the store, she said. Some higher source/force directed me to Nolo that day. It is well worth the price & invaluable in navigating the path for me & by son. Thanks, Lawrence & your supporting cast for a job well done !! This book is long over due. I can't seem to put it down. It even goes to the bathroom with me... I keep calling parents to share the fact that the book is available with them & sent email messages to several boards."
5,very thorough,"This is some very thorough guide on how to make IEP work for your child the best.I have two special needs kids, so had to do IEP several times, and I still found a lot of new for me information there in the book. Very helpful book. Highly recommended."
1,Way overpriced,"First off, this book is waayyyy overpriced. There are other good books on the market at half the cost. And there are other books that are better written, too. I was surprised at the sloppy writing of this new edition. If you are intent on buying this book, find a used copy of the last edition, which is better, or choose one of the better books out there. Don't go by ratings alone. Check out the book in your local bookstore first, just to be sure you find one that meets your needs. The information is this book can be found on the Internet on different sites, so there is no needed to shell out hard-earned dollars for this one. Find something else and you won't be sorry."
5,Excellent Reference Material,"If you are facing the daunting task of having to advocate for your child, this book is and excellent reference. It is written by an attorney and it spells out in easy to understand language what you can expect during the meeting with school officials. You will learn what you can (and can't) realistically expect, tactics for getting what you want for your child, forms and sample documents to help you communicate, legal knowledge and much more.If you are confused by all the acronyms such as IEP, IET, IDEA and others being tossed about, this book will help you learn to navigate your way through this important process."
5,A Must for History/Mystery Buffs,"In her second book about historians Michael and Rebecca, Lillian Stewart Carl takes us to a dig at a priory in Scotland. Sacked by Henry VIII during his attemps to divorce himself from Catharine of Aragon and the Catholic church, the priory is haunted, not only by Henry's victims but by the pasts of the archaeological team. You'll also want to read the first in the series, Ashes to Ashes and then the the third, but hopefully not final installment, Garden of Thorns."
2,"Ronn is the best, but ....","There is no better talk show host for presenting rational positions on all sides of issues, and Ronn is a true professional versed in many areas. However it breaks my heart to admit that his only book completely fails to convey the liveliness and objectivity of his show. Whoever put him up to writing it really let the ball drop by withholding proper editing and guidance. Catch Ronn's show on KGO -Am whenever you can, but skip the book."
1,Owens moves his BS from the left to the right and the other way round and than sticks to the center.,"Owens moves his BS from the left to the right and the other way round and than sticks to the center.Reasoning on the bases of superficial arguments without real understanding the backgroundgives you the perfect training to make a good figure in any political smalltalk without saying anything which would allow anybodyto tie you to a specific school of thinking or party.And while some will find this attitude ""so incredibly balanced"" others will smell the superificial BS that it is and can't stand it.The left and the right are wrong indeed - because they are bought and paid for by the elite.no star for his"
3,"The ""Voice Of Reason""...","...called Cindy Sheehan (and by extension all anti-war protestors) an anti-Semite on August 15,2005. Does that sound like a ...voice of reason?"
1,Save your money!,"Anyone who has listened to Ronn's show for any amount of time can save their money on his book. He just repeats the same old observations and philosophies that he talks about on his show every week. Nothing,at all, new here. Ronn should stop writing books and start reading a few; he is the least prepared talk-show host in the Bay-Area. He praises the Drudge Report, Fox News, and Rush Limbaugh but has nothing but distain and ridicule for people on the left. Especially if they were against the rush to war."
1,Wake me up when its all over,"So, the ""Voice of Reason"" is clearly stating the obvious -- America and Americans should formulate their own centric ideas. So what? What's postulated here is nothing new and really provides nothing enlightening or inspirational. I was an occassional listener to his AM show when I lived in the Bay Area, and its all the same in paper mode -- you can only take small amounts of it, realise its mostly egotistical (while proclaiming not to be) and offer nothing but more confusion for befuddled Americans - particularly at a time when the country is so divided.Is this really the best that a publisher can put out there during these times?"
1,Don't waste your time or money on this one.,"This book seems to reflect Ronn Owens' fear of being disliked. He offers little insight in justifying his so-called ""reasoned"" positions on issues that require making difficult choices, something he seems incapable of doing. Instead, he tries to avoid controversy at all costs by rationalizing his own bland and often populist opinions.Save your money."
2,"DULL AND INCONSISTENT. SHALLOW ""REASONING""",THIS BOOK REALLY DOES NOT DESERVE TWO STARS BUT I ALWAYS FEEL SORRY FOR THE AUTHOR WHEN HE/SHE GETS A ONE STAR REVIEW. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME THIS BOOK HAS LITTLE TO OFFER. A LET DOWN FOR SURE.
1,"Ronn's ""center"" does not exist.","Ronn Owens is entertaining on the air because he is able to simplify issues and inflame listeners, so lots of folks call in with their simple responses. This does not work so well in print. Ronn does not grasp the complexity of the issues facing the country and this book, far too simplistic to be taken seriously, is one of the more vacuous things I've read recently. In fact, I could not finish it. Owens claims to be a ""centrist"" but now leans far to the right. He supports his centrist claim by saying that liberals see him as conservative and conservatives see him as liberal, therefore, he must be in ""the center."" San Francisco liberals know Ronn Owens for the closet Republican that he is!"
4,Betting on the complexity of nature,"Becoming a Tiger is really about animal behavior of all sorts, instinctual as well as learned, that of adult animals as well as of young. The book is completely understandable picked up anywhere and with no knowledge of what came before or interest in what comes after. What McCarthy has done is given us a series of short animal behavior stories taken from scientific literature but run through her considerable wit and sprightly--even sassy--literary style. The author has a thesis of sorts, but the true message of this book is that anyone who believes animal behavior to be simplistic or consistent across species is ridiculously mistaken and that no one will ever go broke betting on the complexity of the natural world."
5,Good gift,"I mailed the book directly to my brother for a gift, and it was received in excellent condition and enjoyed. Turned out to be a good gift for him."
4,perfect for outdoor activities!,"good for venders or just outside activities. Although, you need at least 3 people to set it up. adjustable settings to make it short or long. another down side is that if you unfold it too quickly, the sides may open wrong and you could bend the legs."
2,Bravo Weekender 10 x 10 Quik Shade Instant Canopy,"I ordered four of these and two came damaged. They were replaced & I did get double-billed but that was eventually resolved. They are put up fairly easily but do not seem to be well built. We used these tents for five straight days, taking them down each evening. One button that holds the canopy up is already broken, the frame seems to bend easily & made it hard to put them up if the frame pieces were bending the wrong way. One of the zippers on the storage bag broke & the wheels broke on another bag. They are ok for our use (five days each summer) but I would not consider them good quality or for regular use."
5,"Product GREAT, Shipping Awful.","This is one of the easiest canopies to set up. Excellent design, lightweight and sturdy. I would recommend it without hesitation.UNFORTUNATELY, the item came broken. It was shipped via UPS without external packaging. That's crazy. UPS wrecks everything they get their hands (and feet...and forklifts) on. It was broken at the plastic joints in two places. Because I had to use the item within 10 days for a benefit, I did not return it. We superglued the joint fractures and it held, I believe mostly due to the excellent design. However, the vendor should be taken to task for the irresponsible shipping. I would prefer to pay extra money for the item and have it arrive in good condition, than to receive it broken. And I never ship UPS if I can help it.Would recommend you choose alternate method of shipping and request proper packaging. It's a shame to take a great product and deliver it damaged, but the item is definitely worth having if you can get it in one piece!:)"
3,Disappointed,"I expected this blade to cut like a bandit, being brand new and Oster's Elite line. Nothing! It slogged through my poodle's face hair no better and perhaps even worse than my 10-year old, resharpened Elte. Titanium finish? No improvement whatsoever. At over twice the price of the ""brand x"" Oster blade offered by Amazon, I wonder if I wasted my money. I suppose I could order the cheapie and do a comparison test but then I would have 3 blades that don't do what I want. On the other hand, maybe this is as good as it gets and my practice of cleaning my blades with hot running water and liquid dish soap, followed by a quick honing with diatomaceous earth and oiling, keeps them in top condition. Who knows?Anyway, no glowing report for this ho hum product."
2,Super sharp- in more ways than one,"I got one of these blades when they were still calling them the ""supersteels"" and while it has worked decently for me for about 7 months, I'm going to have to retire it. The guard spikes on the business end have always been noticably sharper than those on the 10 blade that came with my clippers (Andis) but these last two months they seem to be getting worse every time I use it to the point where I'm afraid to use it on a dog for fear of breaking the skin if they wiggle and get poked with it. I'm going to see if the blade sharpener who comes around to the shop can do anything to solve the problem, but I'm not holding out much hope. Because they weren't always this sharp I guess it would be ok for someone who only does their own dogs, but I would warn the pros to be careful."
2,A little silly,My five year old son thought this was a little silly. There's a lot of singing and not much instruction about how to do karate. He watched it once and did not enjoy it at all. We returned it and got him Kung Fu Panda instead. He enjoys fighting along with the Furious Five.
5,Truly a magical experience,"What started out as a way to kill a saturday night has truly changed my life. I thought a couple of Natty Lights and an old VHS would be the high point of the weekend, and then i was transported to a magical world of positive energy and ninja skills. This video is not just for children! It can unlock the treasure chest of golden dragon that waits inside each of you! I now have a lifes purpose and the watermelons of the world do not stand a chance now that i have unlocked my non-violent positve energy that can slice through them like a flaming hawk! Buy this move and let the revolution begin!"
5,Buckinham Nicks,"I'd like to see Lindsey and Stevie do an entire Music DVD of their best songs together for old time sake. No matter what went down between them it seems they will always be soul mates. Also, I very much enjoyed Stevie's Crystal Visions DVD, but Lindsey wasn't in it. Together they are magic!"
4,a guitar player's guitar player,"I am a guitar player who has long been shocked and awed by the playing style of Lindsey Buckingham. This is a long overdue release of one of his solo concerts. I stopped short of 5 stars for this review because it seemed someone decided a supporting cast of musicians should be involved in this concert. Just listen to Lindsey play Big Love and Go Insane as a solo guitarist/vocalist on this DVD, and then wonder why anyone else had to jump in to ""help"" with the rest of the concert. This concert is ideal for someone who wants an intimate look and listen to a very intelligent, gifted and largely over-looked artist."
3,"Not ""The Dance""","This DVD was interesting, in that it presented some old some new and lots of different. I did not like the new treatment most of the old older songs got, I felt disappointed. Some of the new material was nice.I would have to say if you really want to to see him at his best, The Dance DVD and some of the other FM DVDS are better for it. Of course people move on as time goes on, you have to allow for that. Taken in that context, I still enjoyed the DVD and was worth buying it. Just don't expect Vintage Lindsey, this new and improved family Lindsey. Which is ok. Again this is not the best Lindsey in my opinion. But if you're a fan you most likely enjoy this."
3,Shades of Fleetwood Mac,..always a pleasure to hear the guitar work and lyrics of Lindsey Buckingham....a prominent figure in the Fleetwwod Mac line-up for years
3,Only for true Lindsey Buckingham fans,"I saw this on PBS with great anticipation as I too am a long time fan of Lindsey Buckingham. However, this was not Lindsey Buckingham at his best. There are better versions around of almost all the songs on this DVD. Buckingham is a great guitar player, but he is much better showcased on the last two Fleetwood Mac DVDs (Dance and FM in Boston). Only die hard Buckingham fans will enjoy this DVD."
5,Simply Fabulous,"Peter Berley - you have managed to do it again! I am not even considered near - Vegetarian, yet I found Berley's recipes to be delightfully scrumptous. A beautifully written and easy to follow book, I highly recommend it."
3,A Nice Idea,"I like the layout of this book. Having recipes in the order of the seasons, but I would rather have had more main dish recipes. I also have to say I am very disappointed with the pictures. A few of the pictures are of the finished product, but most are not helpful at all. I don't need to see hands on a counter, cracked egg in a bowl, an opened can of tomatoes, etc. Many pictures are a waste of space. The recipes I have tried have been good, but over all I have to say I'm a little disappointed."
4,Good and peculiar recipes,"It's a good cookbook. The recipes are indeed as fast and easy as they claim, and they are very original. Maybe I would favor more olive oil and less soy sauce, but that's a matter of taste. Now that I know it I'll make this substitution and it will be perfect. I love that the recipes are divided in seasons, and that most of them are even vegan. If you want new ideas for a vegetarian diet, this book is for you."
5,"Amazing, Flling, and Easy (Vegetarian) Food","I make recipes from this book a few times every week for my family (we are mostly vegetarian, but will eat free-range organic poultry and sustainably-caught fish). The food is amazing, not just amazing for being vegetarian. Peter Berley has become one of my trusted cookbook authors, such that I will try a recipe of his even if it looks less than amazing to me on paper. It always turns out well and, as a result, I've tried vegetables I never thought I would cook with. Berley's recipes make vegetables like broccoli rabe, eggplant, and Brussels sprouts palatable to my young children. I also love the seasonal, fruit-heavy desserts. I cannot recommend this book enough!I also really love his other book The Flexitarian Table. Those meals are amazing, but take much longer to prepare and I can only swing it on weekends."
4,Good and fresh.,"Prompt delivery and a very fresh product. SSSSSSSOOOOO GGGGGGGOOOOODDDD!!! No melted chocolate, not sticky at all. Peanuts are very fresh, the chocolate is very fresh."
1,Out of print for a reason,"This is not a ""Broach"" sequel, nor is it as Libertarian as the better of his works are. He still turns a phrase and it is readable. But this is not on my list of his memorable works. Don't ""save it"" to read at a special time, just read it when you have nothing you wish to reread."
5,best book in the world,"Red it, read it, read it! So realistic! It is a must. Loved the book. Felt with the charicters. ""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn."" Best line ever written!"
4,Black Knight,"I bought this knight and horse for my son, 2, because he enjoys horses and knights. This is very durable, especially considering the abuse that my 2 and 3 year olds put it through. The knight is removable, and it helps my 2-year-old with hand-eye coordination to put him back in the saddle. The only drawback is the jousting pole. It's removable, and that's a good thing if you want to keep the pole away from children. In the hands of 2-year-old, is a weapon! Of course, this product is not recommended for someone so young, and to make it OK for the children, the pole should be removed anyway. Other than that, the knight and horse have offered endless fun!"
4,Standard you expect from Schleich,"This is another great Schleich knight. We have several of them and this fits right in with all the others. It is well made and unlike Pappo which we also have, the toy doesn't break even with intense play. If your kids are into knights, I would definitely stick with Schleich collection."
5,The best post ever.,"My 10 cats love this post. They love it to death. I wish I could buy a new cover for it. It is in shreds now, but it does save the furniture."
5,Sturdy Scratching Tower,This scratching post is easy to put together (four bolts) and the cats love to scratch upright rather than on the floor.
5,took some getting used to,"The scratching post worked great. I bought it for my girlfriend's cat since he was constantly scratching up the wooden table legs and chair legs. We were a little hesitant at first since he didn't seem interested but I also bought treats (greenies) for him and embedded them in the seams and placed some at the very top of the post. After a few days he began lightly using the scratching post and a couple of weeks later he was putting all of his weight into it when scratching. The cat loves the scratching post. It does tend to shake a bit when he climbs it to knock down the treat we place at the top, but I guess that's to be expected with an 18-20 lb male cat."
4,cats scratching post,We have 3 cats. This is our second Ultimate Scratching Post. We have had our first one over 4 yearsand were pleased with it.
5,Cat Scratch post,"Exactly as advertized. Very stable, especially considering its height. Wanted to get a high one as the cats like to stretch and scratch, and it is working out well in that regards."
5,Good Product,Our cat uses this often for scratching. We got him started by attaching a small toy on the end of a string that he enjoys batting around. THe post is tall so he can strech out on all four feet when he uses it. It is heavy and sturdy so will not tip.
1,Can't understand the other reviews!!,"Bought this hunk of junk ... my two cats could care less about this thing ... do yourself a favor, invest in a cat tree instead ... much more enjoyable for cats!"
2,Great if it was sturdy...,"My cats really seem to like this product, unfortunately after two day it has already broken. From further examination, it looks like the cap on the bottom of the scratcher (not the base I had to screw on) wasn't put together well and the screws came out from the slats that it was screwed into. I don't have the box or the packaging any more so I can't return it. If it weren't for that defect I would have rated it higher because they do use it."
2,Have not received the Perch yet!,"I ordered this because it says in the title ""Ultimate Scratch Post AND PERCH"" that it includes the perch and also cost $7 or $8 more than the listings for the post alone. I received the scratch post the end of February but as of today, 4/12/10, I haven't received the perch yet. Our cat does use the post and it gives him a good place to scratch. Any suggestions how I should contact someone to get the order completed? I've only ordered a few items on Amazon and never had any trouble until now -- or do they take notice of the reviews and act on them???"
3,"Two new cats, mixed use","I just adopted two adult cats who know each other. I wanted to be sure that they had a good scratching post, so I ordered the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post. The younger kitty, took to the scratching post right away. The other cat shunned it. I think the big, older cat may have arthritis in his lower back, so it's uncomfortable to get up on his back legs to scratch. Then I bought a cardboard scratcher that lays flat on the floor and both cats went for it right away. The younger one still uses the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post sometimes, but I can't help but wonder if I'm getting my money's worth..."
5,Great product,"This scratching post is the perfect scratching post. Tall, very sturdy and the best material to attract cats. My kitten scratches on it then hangs on it like the cat in the product picture. At first I thought it might be hard to assemble, but it was very simple and never wobbles or moves.After buying this post I happen to find a video on the Cornell Feline Health Center web site that gives excellent advice for cat scratching problems. They happen to have this very same post pictured in it.I attached to the top a toy that my cat lovesCAT DANCER ORIGINAL. This toy is very inexpensive but cats love it."
5,Excellent scratcher,"My mom's HUGE (22-pound) cat likes this almost as much as the Bergan Turbo Scratcher. It's fairly well made, though it does have to be tightened fairly often or its base (which is two separate pieces) shifts around. We put it in a corner, but even when it's in the middle of the room, he can't knock it over (and considering that he's the size of Cleveland, that's pretty amazing).Note: When he first started to use it, there were strands and bits of the scratching surface littering the floor, that had to be vacuumed up--but after awhile, that seemed to go away....I might still get the perch that goes on top of it, I think the cat might like it--that is, if he can drag his fat ass up there.... ;)"
5,great product,"I have had this post for about two months and am very pleased with it. we have an outdoor cat that we are transitioning to be an indoor/outdoor kitty. the post is very sturdy, easy to assemble, looks nice in any room of the home. I have not seen anything comparable in retail stores in my area. definitely worth the few extra dollars. I expect this product to last for a very long time. great value and I would definitely recommend it."
1,Not for My Kitten,"My kitten (4 months old) is not interested in this at ALL. If I dangle a toy above it, he will strike at it maybe once and then he scratches for a few seconds. He NEVER has touched this since. Plus he is not affected by catnip either, so that is not helpful. I have found him perched on top of it - that is it. For me it was a total waste of money. I would suggest you find out 1st if your kitten/cat is a vertical or horizontal scratcher. My kitten does not scratch the furniture - he scratches on the floor/carpet/rugs, so I bought a $10 scratching mat with a toy and placed it in the corner of the rug where he was scratching and he loves it and uses it. My rug has been saved."
2,"Looks great, but my 3 cats all give it a pass","I have three cats, one of whom only likes sisal, and none of them will use it. I've put it where their favorite scratching post normally went, dangled toys over it, and although they'll trap a toy against it, none of them has the slightest inclination to scratch it. The sisal isn't the ropey stuff that normally gets wrapped around carpeted scratching posts. It's really smooth feeling so maybe that's why. On the plus side it looks great and it's really tall, which would be nice for my cat that likes to stretch all the way up when she scratches, but no dice. Better looking than most, so one extra star for that. It would be a five-star if my cats would use it."
5,great for cats,all cats will love this. helps keep them off the furniture. I bought the post and the scratch pad and my cats love them.
5,My Cat's Favorite,"I wish I had bought this a long time ago then the backs of my two chairs would still be intact. My cat is picky about what she will use to scratch. She used to have a post similar to this one that she wore out. I could never find another post like it after looking at all the local pet stores and big box stores. Meanwhile, I got several different types of posts for my cat to try out including those with rope, cardboard, and carpet. Either she didn't like the type of material used on the post or the post wasn't substantial enough for her to use. She kept going back to scratch the furniture. This large size post is perfect for her. It won't wobble when she attacks it and it's tall enough for her to stretch up to her full length for happy scratching. She prefers this to scratching on anything else now. My furniture is safe."
3,Does the job...sort of,This scratch post is okay. We have two kittens and they have used it a little but they don't seem to like the top of it because there is no padding. I would recommend purchasing a post with padding so the cats can climb on top or if you're going for this one you probably want to add some padding to make it more inviting.
3,Well built but NINE cats won't use it!,"I have nine cats in the house, including 5 VERY playful young ones. Not a single cat will use the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post, even when rubbed with catnip. Quite disappointing since I hoped a vertical scratching post would save my door frames from getting clawed up. It IS heavy, well-made, and will not tip over. However, it was not a good purchase for our household!"
1,Cats don't like,"I am not sure why, but my cats don't care for this scratching post. It could be that they are just being finicky cats, but it also might be that it isn't exactly rock steady. It wobbles a bit. Perhaps I got one that wasn't manufactured correctly? All I know is my cats won't use it, not even a little bit. They much prefer their PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge."
4,My cat really likes this scratching post,One of my cats took to this post right away after just a little bit of cat nip was applied to it. My other doesn't really use it which might be a territorial thing or because she mostly likes to scratch horizontally on the ground rather than vertically.The reason for 4 stars rather than five is because the base split as I was trying to put it together but it still works fine.
5,Best Looking Cat Scratcher Post,I have a big Ragdoll cat-which loves this post. The minute I was trying to assemble the base out of the box-he was already scratching/clawing at it! Very sturdy and well made. Doesn't look bad either in any room you position it.
5,A Great Success,"My cat had never used a scratcher before, so I had to train her by placing her food bowl on top and rewarding her with her food when she began climbing the scratcher. It took a couple of weeks of training, but since then my cat has been consistently using her scratching post as long as her claws weren't too sharp. She's occasionally tempted to scratch canvas bags I sometimes leave around, but she definitely prefers this scratcher. I have to say that this is probably the best purchase I've made for my cat beyond food and litter."
4,"Very nice, little expensive.",Tall enough for a full length stretch but short enough to jump up from the floor to the top (I purchased SmartCat Perch too. See review on perch page.) Seems well build and sturdy even with a 13 pound cat on the top. Some minor/easy assembly required.
4,A Kitten MUST!!!,"I couldn't be happier with this product...if only the ""perch"" I purchased with it were better. The scratching post itself is AWESOME! I have a 6 month old kitten, as well as a 3 month old kitten. They LOVE the scratching post. It is a ""kitty"" essential that actually looks somewhat bearable in your home--a much nicer design than most kitty toys, ""condos"" and ""trees."" (My husband was completely against any kind of ""tower,"" ""condo,"" or ""tree."") However, the ""Perch"" I talked about earlier, is almost a must if you purchase the stand. Don't you want your kitty or kitties to be able to lay on the ""tree"" they just climbed??? The perch sucks. You can easily attach it to the post you just purchased, however, a week or so of just one kitten (had this months before the ""newer"" kitten came along), the perch was coming detached. Now, a couple months later, the perch is completely detached. I am now looking into other ways to attach it more permanently myself."
4,Best Scratching Post I've ever owned,"The cats definitely love this thing. One of them finally figured out how to climb on the top of it. My only complaints are around the base of the thing. Seems like a poor design decision to facilitate easier shipping packaging. The base basically comes in two halves, and each half only gets one screw, so if you twist the post, the two halves will shift/slide against each other like two tectonic plates.That being said, the cats use it more often than any other item in the house to scratch on. The few times one of them opts for the couch, we spray them with water to hopefully get it through their thick heads that it is not for scratching.Worth the seemingly excessive price."
4,Huge.,"My cat seems to like this post and it is tall enough that he can completely stretch out and scratch.However, because of the large size of the product, I had to move it so it is not in the usual spot. Now the cat seems to favor his corregated cardboard scratcher (which I just changed the insert and put fresh catnip into).I think that this product could be improved with the inclusion of some catnip. I'll have to try to put some in somehow."
1,Post screws scratch hardwood floors!,"This item just arrived and my cat is very interested in it. The post is sturdy and easy to assemble. However, the heads of the screws that were included to attach the base are too big to ""sink"", so they protrude on the bottom. This makes the base a bit wobbly and worst of all, can damage my hardwood floors!! I hope the manufacturer will quickly send new screws to replace these that do not go deep enough into the composite wood base!! Otherwise, sadly, it will have to go back. If you have carpeted floors, this may not be an issue for you.I will update if Amazon/manufacturer sends screws that fit better."
2,Great post...if my cat would just use it,"I don't know what the deal is with my cat but she steers clear of this scratching post. I've had it for about 3 months now, and I have tried putting treats on it, dousing it in catnip spray, changing the location, but all to no avail. She strolls right by it and scratches the couch - ugh! If my cat liked it this would definitely be a 5-star purchase - it's sturdy, tall, and looks pretty nice compared to other posts, but my cat seems to prefer our other ugly sisal/carpet post. Too bad."
5,Great Scratching Post!!!~*,"It's a scratching post. The size is great because my cat is large. I noticed other reviews about it having a shaky base so I guess I was lucky being that the base it came with was nice and stable once it was all put together. Ethier way no complaints here, currently saving my furniture from being destroyed. Great product!"
5,Shirley is naughty.....,Shirley is naughty.....she is shredding my furniture with her little claws! I have 3 other scratching items besides my furniture and she still goes to the furniture....until the Ultimate Scratching post! She took to it right away! I am hopeful that this is the answer and she can keep her little claws!
5,I am so glad this scratching post exists,"My husband and I rescued some feral kittens from our backyard and ended up keeping two of them. The girl kitty is tiny and loves the cardboard scratching area in the middle of the round Bergan Turbo Track, but the boy kitty has grown into an enormous eighteen-pound almost doglike creature; very smart and cuddly but he needs toys that can handle his strength and bulk.Our boy kitty is so smart and wants to be good, but until we were fortunate to find this scratching post, he was always getting in trouble (that is, we were saying ""no"" in a firm voice) for scratching the carpet and the furniture. Now he's never in trouble (unless he plays too rough with his tiny sister), because he knows this is the place to go for a nice scratch-and-stretch. We've had this scratching post for quite a while now, and it still looks great and doesn't tip, even when our giant boy kitty throws himself at it or leans his full bulk on it."
3,"Very sturdy, but my cats don't use it...","It is very sturdy and very easy to assemble, but my five cats don't seem interested in it. They have those cardboard scratching posts on the floor and can't quite make out what to do with this. I bought catnip spray, put toys on top of it, around it..everything. I even demonstrated scratching on it. They just didn't care. I trained them so well not to scratch on furniture--and I guess they think that this is furniture.It is rather tall and heavy....well made, but, at least for me, it generated no interest among my feline friends.....I will keep trying.I am giving it three stars for its construction. It seems hard to destroy. However, it doesn't seem to be a cat magnet in my house."
4,different from the picture,"I was very excited to get this post because of all the great reviews. But the base was 2 pieces( 8""x16"" each) instead of one and after I screw them on, there was a pretty obvious gap between the pieces even though I tried very hard to squeeze them together, and the post wobbles a little, not as stable as I expected. I'm not sure if I should return it 'cause my cats seem to like to use it, especially after I put some of their favorite food on the top. Will update the review later if neccesary."
4,Good looking and functional post,"This post is solid & tall enough for cats to get a good stretch when they scratch, and it doesn't move or tip over. I have 4 cats, but unfortunately they don't like sisal, so they ignored the post until I wrapped with a light weight carpet - nailed it on so they can scratch it & dig their claws in. 3 of the cats now use it. Fifi, however, still prefers the steps and carpets. Sticky Paws tape is helping with that. Four stars because of the sisal issue - which is really the cats' fault, not the quality of the post.Feb. 7 2012 - Fifi now is using the post too."
5,Very sturdy and durable,"My cats have never been furniture scratchers (unless its leather, that is a completely different ball game!) but they do however, like to dig at the carpet. It has cost me a lot of money in the past when moving out of apartments. Since those days, I've always kept a scratcher, and they know that's what it's there for. The top also doubles a pedestal. For cats that like the perch feature...I think it's a really good investment of $50, it's made with the best quality sisal paneling I have seen. No carpeting that will eventually be dug away like other cheap scratchers. It is very hard to find a scratcher of this quality locally.Sometimes I will sprinkle catnip or valerian root from a capsule on the scratcher and it will rekindle my cats' relationship with the post. I have it conveniently located in a corner and they still use it, despite it being hidden away.I highly suggest this scratching post due to its durability and price."
5,Love,My cat just loves this scratching post. She is very active and I wanted her to have something to climb when she cannot go outside. Its very durable. Much taller than I had expected but that makes it even better for my kitty.
3,It's ok,"I own three different scratching posts and this one is my cats' least favorite. They use it only sporadically. They prefer the posts with twine wrapped around it, which cost me about $10-$15. They also still prefer my leather dining chairs. The look of Smartcat Ultimate scratching post is just ok. It looks better on the photo than in real life. There are two big seams on each side of the post and visible screw heads on the top, kinda cheap looking for the price. One of my cats does like sitting on top of it."
3,"A nice post, but not for all cats!","I have two cats and both of them like to scratch vertically on my couch! I have many cardboard scratchers, which both of them use, but they are horizontal. I purchased this one because of the great reviews, and one cat LOVES it, and the other just looks at it, is confused, and walks away. It might be because the cat that uses it is a bit of a bully and my other cat is scared to use something that has been ""marked."" Regardless, it has reduced the amount of scratching on my couches by half, which is definitely an improvement!"
5,Awesome! Furniture is Saved.,"Our four month old kitten had no interest in the traditional scratch pads we bought. We bought the one that was on an incline and the one that laid flat. No amount of cat nip would entice him to scratch (though it did make him high). Anyway, I read the reviews about this thing on Amazon and took the chance. As soon as we opened the box, ""Scruffy"" started to scratch it. We had to pull him away to finish unpacking it. The post is working great and I think we found the solution that will protect our furniture and expensive carpets. I've just ordered a second one for the upstairs.The only problem was it arrived with a slight crack (from shipping) on the top piece of wood, but it was minor and did not affect the usage."
5,If you have cats; this is a MUST have! Get it.,"My lovely cat, Creamsy was starting to destroy my two favorite chairs. I purchased this strictly on the glowing reviews. I thought it was costly at first; but then I went to a pet ""mart"" type of store where cheaper-looking scratching posts cost more money.If you have cats; RUN -- don't walk to your computer and place an order for this immediately. My cat just adores it. And now he uses this exclusively and my chairs have been saved!!He loves to stretch tall and scratch this. He also uses it as a perch. It's funny to watch him try to do that.It's very sturdy and a very handsome piece of furniture."
1,Useless,"Flimsy base and my cat only occasionally touches it. Preferring the sturdy wooden end table next to it. I tried cat nip, It didn't work. I'm a bit suspect of some of these 4-5 star reviews. $50 is way too much."
2,The scratching area is vertical not horizontal,Most scratching posts have the material flow horizontally but this one goes vertical. Our cat didn't like it at all. It doesn't come with any catnip either. It is very sturdy and looks great but if the cat won't use it it's just a waste of space for a post.
5,Awesome post,"We have a relatively large cat, and other scratching posts just weren't long enough. He immediately took to it and started scrambling up and down. If you get the SmartCat Perch you can put it by the window and our cat will sleep on top all day, then use the scratching post to stretch on when he wakes up. A worthy investment that I would make again."
