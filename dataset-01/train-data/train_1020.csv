5,Super Long Lashes,This Mascara is the best I have found anywhere. It definately gives a false lash effect with no effort at all.
2,"Beautiful at first, but smears terribly","First, some credit where it's due: When you apply this product, it looks TV-good - you'll seem to be wearing modest artificial eyelashes. Give it an hour or two, though, and it's straight to the heroin-chic, ""Are you OK?"" sort of look.Seriously, my roommate as well as a very sweet boyfriend finally suggested I stop using YSL mascara - in separate conversations - because at first glance, they thought something was physically WRONG. Ha.An exception: I'd recommend it if you're having a portrait shot (or something) and would cautiously recommend it if you're dropping by a special event for an hour or two. Otherwise, grocery-store stuff is better."
3,Hummmmm,"It did not do what it promise. Still cant find the perfect mascara. I'll keep looking, maybe Dior will have the answer ??"
5,Awesome Product,This mascara is great. I love the colors. I've got burgundy and purple which both really make my green eyes stand out. The product goes on well and really thickens lashes. Go easy on lower lashes to avoid spider legs look. It stays on all day without smudging and even survives a 90 minute Kung Fu black belt class in 90+ degree Atlanta weather without A/C. Highly recommended and definitely worth the money.
3,good mascara but not for this price,This mascara was okay. I liked the smell and light texture but it didn't make a big change to my lashes. If it wasn't relatively expensive one it would be a good option fo light make up
4,Mascara,Overall it is really rich in color and gives you length but it does get clumpy through out the day.Now knowing that I am not totally agreeing on the price of the product.
5,Perfect mascara,Perfect mascara. Gives volume and length to your eyelashes. Would buy it again. Be sure to apply more than a layer at night to give a dramatic look
2,Probably Stale,"While these bars were a good ""deal"" versus the supermarket price, I was pretty disappointed to find that the expiration date on the individual packages is May of this year. Normally, you would find a much further out date. I believe these were overstocked and dumped onto customers via Amazon. They also are kind of dry and hard versus ones I purchased at the supermarket, likely for the same reason. My kids didn't like them, either, even when we went on a roadtrip and they were the only thing in the car to eat-- that's saying a lot! I ended up throwing them all away. Obviously don't recommend."
1,Don't go looking for this one,"You can find better coverage of the Sydney Olympics online. After I ordered this tape, I read the accolades for Bud Greenspan, NBC's Olympic video producer, and got ready to relive the moments. I was disappointed, to say the least. I wrote a letter to NBC excoriating them for actually cutting out the middle of the 800 meter races (they're only 2 minutes long, for Pete's sake!), among other things. I never heard back. You would think that they could use their extensive footage of the Games for something, but no. Although the coverage of the women's 400 meters and Kathy Freeman was great - a truly inspiring story there, as opposed to the Marion Jones overplay - this video is not worth the 5 cents it cost to make, and Bud Greenspan should be ashamed. Don't buy it!"
3,"Yet another of the first 's 'Stuffed and Mounted' Red Green tapes, but not quite as good as the rest","A bit too much dry humour here. Notquite as funny as the Beef Project,et, al. The others, but still enoughhumour in it to warrent a look, ifyou are a Red Green fan."
3,This CD is ADD!,"Well, our friends here at [...] have done it again. This CD is incorrectly labeld as an all digital recording when in fact these concertos on this CD are ADD-ANALOG! Fine musicanship and good quality analog. Mr. Pinnock does his usual fine job."
5,The Best Popular Math Book I Have Read,"As a mathematician who doesn't generally enjoy popular math books, I found Mathematics and the Unexpected to be quite pleasant reading. Instead of being a treatise on the enjoyment of puzzles, I think it conveyed much of how mathematics is integral towards human understanding of the world around us. I have recommended it to my non-mathematician friends, to the point that my copy is on permanent loan."
2,Waste of Money,"I bought the item four years ago because of its bagless feature but due to a number of problems I experienced with the vacuum cleaner I barely used it. At first the ""Adjustable Deluxe Nozzle"" stopped working. After I took it apart and cleaned it up, it worked for a while and then stopped again and again. Eventually I threw it away and bought a simpler nozzle and was happy for some time. However it did not last long. The vacuum cleaner became unusable again and forever. The problem was that one day the retractable cord disappeared inside the cleaner and could not be retracted any more. I attempted to take the cleaner apart but failed to do it without damaging its body. That was it. It was my last try. The warranty no longer valid, the only option for me is to put the thing into the garbage canister."
3,"Adequate, but not great","After battling tennis elbow for 6 months and finally starting physical therapy for it, I decided to get a brace to take pressure off the muscle group. I bought this and the Band-It XM magnetic brace. The gel pad in this extends beyond the strap and hits the bend of my arm, making it quite uncomfortable. The Band-It, on the other hand, feels much better, works simultaneously on lateral AND medial epicondylitis, and is easier to adjust."
1,Not cold enough,I was disappointed. The gel pack doesn't get very cold and it doesn't stay cold very long. I would not recommend this product.
4,Lasts and works well,"I use this mainly for racquetball, and I only have to replace it once every year or two when the velcro wears out. It stays on securely when I perspire, and gives good support. It is not a guarantee that your tendon will not inflame from overuse, but it is a good preventive measure. I will buy it again."
1,Disappointed,"The rods don't line up (bad angle in the block) to get the knife into the ""v"" of the rod for sharpening."
4,Works great,"For the price i think this works great, the only reason i dont give it 5 stars is because of how easily the ceramic cloggs, i mean you can wash it off with some soap and water, or use an eraser on it but it still looks kinda dirty."
2,Don't Buy It if You Want to Sharpen A Quality Knife,The sticks are not for sharpening a quality steel knife from Germany or Japan. The storage box is made from low quality wood full of knots and looks real ugly even though the picture of the box shown by Amazon is very nice.
2,Rods too short,"Instructions not explicit enough, I feel that the rods are too short for longer knives. Don't really recommend this particular sharpener."
4,"Beautiful detailed dolls, but a bit confused about variations","My 5 year-old daughter has been collecting the tiny Disney Fairies and received two of the larger fairies for Christmas. They are very detailed and beautiful and easier to handle. However, I am a bit confused because I have seen several different Tinker Bells, and now two different Firas. The other Fira has a much more colorful costume and different hair - I wonder why the variation? Disney should just stick to the illustrations in the books. Despite the design confusion these dolls are lovely and it is wonderful to have wholesome sweet dolls for my daughter to play make believe. I have read other reviews where dolls fell apart, but so far these dolls are sturdy enough for gentle play; however they are more delicate than your typical barbie-type doll (the wings and costumes will probably rip if played with roughly) so the child must be old enough to understand how to handle them properly."
3,wrong toy,"I ordered this fairy: Fira and received a different fairy. As I had ordered it for a gift, I didn't have time to return it and request the one I had originally ordered. This was disappointing."
2,Poor Quality,"As a parent I am very disappointed in the quality of these dolls. Our first was Bess. On the way home from the store her leg fell off. We turned around and returned her. The next doll was one hour old and her head fell off. Fira's wings fell off, Rani's head is very loose but still attached. When I purchase a doll at the Disney store I ask for it to be opened and inspected first. I have refused several. My five year old is devastated by the quality issues because she loves these dolls and enjoys listening to the books about each. Shame on Disney for not creating dolls that can withstand creative play!"
4,Karcher K293 1400 PSI Electric Pressure Washer,Works pretty good for cleaning my pool deck and patio area now and then. Much better than using a hose. Best price around.Karcher K293 1400 PSI Electric Pressure Washer.
2,Bicycle pump hose,Photo and description were inadequate. Hose connector was wrong size and therefore unusable on my pump.
1,lousy quality,I bought one in July and had to return it for poor sound quality (my 1st time returning any merchandise). The replacement was no improvement. Some tracks doesn't play at all. Will not be buying cd online anymore from Amazon.
3,Essential to your 70's collection,"I couldn't possibly provide a more concise review of the music on this Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes collection than can be found in the review entitled, ""Seventies soul from Philadelphia"". I'll just add that despite this album's 2004 mastering, most people will find it lacking in bass. The sound is clean, clear, and free from background noise, but you'll be missing out on the bass that you will find on the The Blue Notes' excellent vinyl releases. A recommended collection, but bring your equalizer."
4,Diner Dash is a Hoot for Kids and Adults,"I bought this for my 13 year old niece who was addicted to the online game. We've played several times together and it is so much fun! The more you play, the more you want to play. Good, clean video game fun - finally!"
4,Great combo gift,"I am a big fan of Diner Dash and although I enjoyed Diner Dash 2 more they both are great games and easy to learn. The levels do get pretty tough and become challenging which can be great fun for some and frustrating for others. All in all, a great buy and great entertainment."
5,Who is this person who copied this album?,"They seem to think they knew the band, but forgot two of the important members. Eddie Cook (my brother) on bass and Mike Cook (my cousin) on drums and yes, you have Bing McCoy (organ), Ronnie Cook (my brother) on lead, Ronnie Hughes (singer), Wilfred Wilson III on Sax...They all made this wonderful group. This group could compete with the ""best"" of them. I remember the Battle of Bands at the Paramont and winning all time time. They were a young group of men who when the time came, served their country and music faded for our protection. If they had had the opportunities such as Dave Matthews and the like, they would have made it big. Some of them are still here and I know their love for music still exists. They were some talented guys...CVC Martin"
2,disappointing,"Pyle's pirate artwork is the finest in the genre , Unfortunately too little of it is on display in this book ."
3,A Book For People That Like Fiction,"This book is a collection of fictional pirate stories that is sure to entertain young adults. Some of the dialog is in the Old English format, but it is not that difficult to get through. I was dissapointed in the book because it was exclusively fiction and the stories were not even based on true stories. I would not recomend this book for anyone above the highschool grade level. It is a book of adventure stories that would appeal to young males. One of the strong points of this book is that it had excellent drawings. These drawings were spread throughout the book and helped you get an image of the story. If you are interested in the history of pirates don't make the mistake I did because you will be disappointed."
1,"Quality material-?, just too big for a small dog","Received Squeaker ball today. It is too big for her little mouth to squeak. If this was available in TWO SIZES it would be #1 squeak toy. Dog is 7 pounds. Would be great for Medium sized dogs and larger.1-1-10Looked at all Squeaker toys. I wanted a ball to help exercise our dog. If anyone knows of a Squeaker ball that is SMALLER and this quality PLEASE reply. THANK YOU.1-7-10The dog just chewed a hole in the ""Quality material."" I really thought it was more durable. Star rating changed from 5 to 1. If you buy this ball use if for ""fetch"" only, don't let dog hold onto it."
1,Fell apart in less than 2 hours,"I bought this for my 6 year old cocker spaniel who only weights 19 lbs. She is not rough on toys at all, she only played catch with it, she doesn't actually chew on it and it still fell apart. We played with it as soon as I got it, and it started to fall apart immediately. The seams are not sewn together well and stuffing started to come out of the seams. After a few days, we had to throw it away because we were scared she would swallow some of the stuffing. It is a cute toy, but not durable at all. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Disappointment,My error in expecting a compilation of greatest hits on a CD...compounded by very poor performances in a questionable recording situation. A really bad piece of work! Wish I could return the item...will probably place it in a future White Elephant sale. And these gentlemen are really top notch...perhaps one could look at it as a piece of history to justify the purchase.
4,Great Behind the scenes rehearsal,"OK - this is not a performance by The Four Tops, but it shows the viewer/concert goer all that is/was involved with touring. This was produced before The Pieces of the Puzzle were formed and who now accompany the Four Tops on tour. And while the camera work is not the greatest, it is good being that it is over 30 years old. The songs being performed include more than just the hits The Tops had up to that time. The person who attends a live concert probably does not even think about what is involved and the rehearsals the artists have to do before a performance when the musicians are local talent and do not travel with the artist(s). This is just a hint at that.As a long time (39 years) Four Tops fan, I would recommend this video to anyone hungry for footage of The Four Tops, and it is sure to become a collector's item.Can we get some more stuff like this as well as concert performances????Margie"
2,not what I expected,"Being a huge 4 tops fan I pre-ordered this a few weeks ago. It isn't what I expected. I thought it was concert footage like their 40 year anniversary DVD, but instead it is footage of what appears to be rehearsals for a tv performance. The video is choppy and the cameraman, yes one camera, probably an old 16mm movie camera, is constantly moving around. Sometimes you find yourself looking at the back of their heads. It does contain a lead by both Lawrence and Duke, which is nice. This appears to be the making of the making of a 4 tops tv appearance."
2,I learned a valuable lesson,"The Four TopsI wish I had read these reviews seriously before purchasing this DVD. The sound quality is so bad that you can't even hear the words of the songs and worse yet, the outstanding voice of Levi Stubbs.The filming angles, etc were not a concern to me since I really bought the DVD for the music.I am very disappointed and, of course, cannot return the item.Don't make the same mistake I did in buying this DVD; it is most definitely not worth the $17.99!"
5,THE FOUR TOPS 1971 AT THEIR BEST!,"This is the Four Tops at their best in 1971, okay the camera angles may not be the best, but that was the era, the colour is just superb and the sound in most parts.Here in the UK we would refer to it as being ""in the raw"" - but if only some big name young singers these days could sing like LEVI STUBBS JR does in this French TV Recording Studio, What a True Talent LEVI is.The rhythm musicians are from the USA and the brass section are French, and they sound Good!It is also so good to see OBIE take lead for once on the first verse of ""Mack The Knife"" some of the choices of tunes reflect French Soul tastes in the 70's and perhaps still today to Jazz.This is well worthwhile having in your collection it is a True Collector's Piece, it makes you wonder how many other GEMS of film footage are in the vaults, get that door open and let us have more of MOTOWN from the 60's and 70's!John"
2,Pretty disturbing,"This is a book that I will be re-selling, and NOT reading to my children. I felt that it treated the various people groups with little respect, and was racially insensitive to boot. God's world and God's plan are so much bigger than the ideas put forth in this book."
3,Dark Brown My Foot,"This is as close as you can get to black without being absolutely black. There is not even a hint of brown in the foot stool. It's beautiful, but it looks hideous with my dark brown leather furniture. I cannot imagine having to return this monster! Don't be fooled by the color shown. It's black. However, it IS a beautiful and quality piece of furniture, I bought a slip-cover and I'm much happier now."
5,ADKGirl,"Very satisfied. Dark Brown color is true to picture. Clean lines, fits my space well. Quality is good for this price."
3,"very good video, but very poor audio","I found the TV was easy to setup. I think the picture quality is excellent. I have two issues with TV. The Standard 5W speaker are not just bad they are an total embarrasement. I can't believe someone would build a $2k TV with such bad audio. Be preparded to invest in a home theater system. The good picture is just nothing worth without the sound. I got me a Bose 321 and now I'm really happy!I am still struggeling finding out the remote programming code for the TV. None of the codes provided by Bose seem to be working. I called Funai customer service and they told me to try Sylvania, Funai and Emersons codes as well, but still no success."
2,Not too spectacular,"LA confidential is awesome, but I can't really see the logic in packaging it with a bunch of mediocre ""hits"". City of Angels is not a good movie, and a perfect murder lacks any depth whatsoever. Contact is interesting, but too slow to hold much interest. Don't buy this gift set, instead, pick out the movies individually....LA confidential being the best."
3,Special Edition Gift Set: Warner Home Video,It is always gut to see really gut movies.. and we all love gift sets
4,Captivating.,"Not necessarily the correct wiew of the premiddleages, but so what. I kept turning those pages and it is great."
5,best book of all time(with other three),This is book along with one kings way and King and Emporer are the best books of all time. They mix a immersive plot with lots of heart pounding action and drama. They are too good almost to be true.
4,A fine book indeed. Well-written and descriptive.,"I picked this book up after listening to the rantings of the middle aged weirdo at a used bookstore in New Castle, DE. He spoke in a funny accent, but he sure had a great taste in books! The Hammer and The Cross is a great work of fiction. It is the story of a great period of history (the viking conquest) told from the viewpoint of a peasant. Good dialogue, and some nice violence to boot. Ha ha. To boot! Shef kicks people!"
1,Too aggressive against Christendom,"I thought that this book was way too mean on Christians, who are nice people, fighting against enslavement in various places.Really, this Mr Harrison must be mad."
2,I've seen better!,"Whenever anyone criticizes the Suzuki method, I always raise a red flag (review previous to this one). It's been around forever and has done a world of good!! The Suzuki method books include very mature pieces.As a teacher, First Lessons, just doesn't have enough warm-ups. The ABCs of Violin is better--it's a longer book and includes more material--great selections of pieces, excellent warm-ups. The Suzuki books have minimal warm-ups, mainly pieces, but excellent selection of pieces.First Lessons is an ok book as a supplement just in the beginning, but the Suzuki books and the ABCs of Violin have books you can move on to. Suzuki, Books 1 through 10 and the ABCs of Violin, Books 1 through 5."
5,Better than the books my teacher suggested!,"The progression of pieces (and big bonus of being able to listen to them all on the CD) for this book is far superior to that of the Suzuki method (or the ABC for violin book). The selection of songs is neither too juvenile nor too complicated- this is my favorite book out of the 7 or 8 I now own. I am a first year violin student and am supplementing the books my teacher chose with some of my own selection that have more playable music, such as this one. If you only get ONE violin books- this is the one."
4,Not for the absolute beginner,Not for the absolute beginner but a good supplement for lessons with a qualified instructor. I use this when I practice alone and find the pieces challenging but worth the effort.
5,First Lessons Violin Bok,This book arrived in good time (to Australia) and in excellent condition. Happy with this purchase.
3,Intriguing,"Repetitive. The whole thing could have been condensed to one chapter. After a certain point, I couldn't read anymore. Nevertheless, the concept is inspiring."
2,Too anti-left,"I am a lefty but I also am a preacher in a progressive church. I couldn't bring myself to finish the book because I couldn't stand the continous critisism of ""Lefties"" I would hope it changed later in the book and if it does maybe I'll finish it."
2,Theoretical nonsense,"This book is pretty underwhelming. It starts off with some ideas that are high and lofty, but, looking at some of the author's presumptions and conclusions, it doesn't amount to that much, or at least an argument for me finishing the book.Even if his comments are true, it's not something that gets me excited. And the whole ""your political enemies are really nice friendly people"" thing is hard to swallow. I guess I'm just not enough of a theologian for this one."
1,Window on Humanity: A Concise Introduction to Anthropology,"Unfortunately, this book never arrived. It was for a college class for my son, and we ended up having to buy one on campus at a considerable increase in cost. Amazon is refunding my money, however."
4,Window on Humanity review,"I ordered this product last minute for the spring semester of school and I was pleased to see that it was shipped on time so I had it for the first day of class. Despite a few pages highlighted from the previous owner, it was a great purchase. Compared to the campus bookstore's price of $60, I only paid a total of around $10 (including shipping and handling)."
1,Sucks at shipping items on time!,"I ordered this book on the 17th of august...it said august 24th-september 9th for shipping...and well I haven't received the book and the status for the past week has said ""shipping soon"""
5,Excellent Study!,"I received this booklet in record time, and as I expected, New. I have never received anything quite this fast.The timeline created by Carroll is exactly what I was looking for. A very detailed study. Thank you."
5,I Wanna Rock N Roll All Nite and Play Pinball Every Day!,"This version of KISS pinball is a *must* have for all KISS fans. You get two different playing fields to chose from (""Last Stop : Oblivion"" and ""Netherworld"") and 4 different levels of play (Regular, Novice, Arcade, and Tournament). Also, you can play for points or go for the theme of the board you are playing and get to the bonus games! The graphics and sounds are excellent. Both music and voices (Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons)from the band themselves!Although one note : there are some phrases voiced in the game that may be inappropriate for people under 13, but they do have a parental lock option on the game, so your little KISS fans can play, too!"
2,Congestion,"1.Dislike the huge kiss picture on table view, serves no purpose. 2.Table view cannot be ajusted for different angles. The angles you offer are hard to read, the moving angle table shot focuses on the ball and not the whole screen, which gets pretty frustrating! 3.The interaction screen is to small and placed off in the corner-wrong placement."
5,the entire set is the best,"This book rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Although I have only 4 or 5 books of Bruce Hale, he is my favorite author."
3,"A Simpler Arthur Book - a review of ""Arthur's Valentine""","This Arthur book has less text and a simpler story than some of the others we have read, such as ""Arthur's Thanksgiving"".As is suggested by the ""card catalog"" review, confusion abounds when Arthur receives mystery valentines. In the process of guessing wrong, and having his valentines blown all over the school yard, Arthur is teased for having a girl friend.Unlike other Arthur books there is no strong moral behind the story, and the characters aren't shown that teasing is wrong. Instead Arthur finds out who his mystery admirer is when he receives a movie ticket. The book ends sweetly (I guess?!) when Arthur goes to the theater, finds out who his admirer is, and leaves after promising a kiss. [He delivers multiple kisses in the form of Hersey's chocolate kisses and a heart card.]Three Stars. Cute book. Okay artwork. Okay Read-aloud. Not a great deal of concept here, but we are talking about valentines day."
1,The worst radio in the world,"the radio came quickly, but just 15 days ago, I start having troubles w/ the radio, it didn't read CD's, Dvd's, SD's, by the way, the radio didn't read MP4, only in AVI. .. another thing to be dissapointed was the TV funtion it was terrible I never could To look at television it or hear it. the sound was excellent. but that it. I use it only to hear radio, then I return the radio and get a refound. I won't ever would buy another of one."
1,It's a risk to buy one!!,"Apparently it is a good purchase because it is an extraordinary price, but I bought one six months ago by internet and my technician installed it well. It worked for three months well but suddently began to swap beetween FM Stereo and DVD Player without reason. After two months more, the stereo shut down and shut on whitout any contact, just the car was on and the DVD player swap beetwen ""on and off"" on it own. It was a trouble, but the worst thing was when the radio didn't switch on again, just with six month of use.Actually I am looking another DVD player with a renowned brand."
3,Need a manual to use it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Please, I need a little help; May I have a manual?I would like to download at internet.I don't know the function of all the buttons.How can I memorize a radio station?The LCD display have a good quality.The main button(joystick)is extremely sensitive, is hard to handle.Thank all of you"
2,Low Carb Angel Food Puffs,"I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix. I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one."
5,Good buy!!,"I purchased this book as a gift for my son, who loves westerns. Thus I did not read it myself...but the book arrived on time, is in good shape, and he loves it, so we both are very happy. Cindy."
1,Horrible Steering,"I got this stroller as a gift because I wanted it really bad from seeing all the great positive reviews.... well it is horrible! It isbuilt well and has a lot of room... it is like the cadillac of strollers, but it comes with a price/consequence. My son is two years old and we have a month old... our son is about 30 lbs (tall and lean). Regardless of where we decide to put him the stroller ill not turn in any direction we want. We tried utting him in the front and the back, but nothing seemed to work out. I am soo disapointed. Are the wheels not easy to turn because it is new?!?! It is just so aggravating."
1,the worst purchase ever,"This is the most annoying, worthless thing i have ever bought. My 22 month old and newborn weigh a total of 39 pounds and it is IMPOSSIBLE to steer. If you want to push the stroller in a straight line only, then i guess it would work out. I can't believe this is even considered to be a double stroller."
1,Horrible - Does not turn!!!,"I loved my 1st Eddie Bauer Double stroller, but after 5years and 3 welding jobs it needed to be replaced. I bought this one because I thought it would be the same. I loved the color and the look and the style - but no matter what I did, it would not turn!!!!! I had my 21mo and 7mo in the stroller, so it definately had nothing to do with the weight of the children. I have 4 kids, please take my advise when I say that this stroller is not worth your time and money. I returned it and purchased something different."
1,Wish I never bought it,"My children are two years apart, so I thought a double stroller with so many options would be great. However, this double stroller completely lacked. Its the heaviest, bulkiest stroller I've ever seen. And to make matters worse, the steering was horrible. You must use both hands to steer this, so you can forget talking on the cell. I live in a neighborhood with a lot of gently winding roads. I never thought anything of it with my other stollers, but after taking this one for a stroll I felt like I just spent two hours at the gym working my back and arms. I used it for maybe a month and finally had enough and got a double jogging stroller. I gave this one to a friend who was having her second child. She, too, used this stroller once and had enough. What a total waste of my money."
2,shabby condition,Very disappointed with the condition of this paperback.if it were not so much hassle i would return it!I'll be more selective in the future.
5,Best Vintage Dior!,"This book covers the vintage years when Dior was alive. Irving Penn, Richard Avedon are some of the photographers. Easy to read, mainly black and white photos, it gives a coveted look at the early years when Dior was starting. It is an exceptional book, with great photos, fantastic for fashion history fans. Photos are very large, book is oversized. I would say this is the best vintage Dior book I have ever received and I highly recommend it!"
5,Great Book - Highly Recommended,"This book is for anyone especially Christians who want to know what ever happened to the 'Old Time Religion'. It carefully and thoroughly shows that the established 'Churches' lost their vision and thus the place in Americans' hearts. It is well written, researched and documented. I highly recommend it."
5,Best GPS Module Out There,"First of all, ""electronics fan from dallas"" doesn't know what he's talking about. WAAS does indeed exist, and the GPS receiver in the Geode is definitely capable of utilizing WAAS to enhance accuracy.The Geode, although pricey, does appear to be the best GPS module for Visor. It has the fastest time to first fix, a magnetic compass built in, tons of storage space for maps (up to 128 Megs), very nice mapping software, and long battery life (over 20 hours on two AA's)."
2,The Snail Pace GPS!,"I found the maps to be basically unusable while driving in my car. No street names, slow routing, slow screen shots of the map . Impossible to tap on street names while you are driving to determine actual location. The Geode lost Satellite fix inside the car five times in a 10 minute trip. Very slow when switching to a desired map detail level. You have to reset the map level each time you turn on the unit. The maps are too big! You can only add about two maps onto your PDA"
2,Geodiscovery is practically out of business,"The Geode has high accuracy because it uses WAAS. But release 1.3 (the latest release) draws maps slowly, does not support color and does not use the industry standard NMEA interface (necessary to use the Geode with mapping software not made by Geodiscovery).Release 1.4 is just a beta and it greatly improves drawing speed and does support color. But the NMEA interface rarely works and this prevents use of the Geode with 3rd party mapping software.Also, the battery life is poor -- only about 3 hours -- and the MMC slots do not work.Perhaps what is worst is that Geodiscovery support is not functional at all. They do not return phone calls or emails. So if you have a problem, you are out of luck.I think that the Magellan Companion ($150) is the best bet right now. It does not use WAAS. However, if you really want the 2-3 meter accuracy, you can get the Sky Golf GPS (looks a lot like the Companion and costs $400) which does use WAAS."
1,Where is Geodiscovery?,"This product holds a LOT of potential. Unfortunately that's all it is right now - POTENTIAL.The released software doesn't support color, routing, searching/finding, MMC memory cards, topographical maps. The Magellan GPS Companion I also have is more reliable and works with more software.On top of all of that, the company has ceased all communication with the outside world. They don't answer their phones and I even know of a couple of people who have obtained RMA numbers, sent their Geodes back to Geodiscovery, Geodiscovery has signed for and received them but has NOT returned their money (for over a month now).If I thought I could get my money back from Geodiscovery, I'd be returning mine - it doesn't work as advertised."
1,What a great GPS! HAHAHAHAHAHA What a joke!,"I had my Geode for about a week, and then realized that this is just not working for me! No connection while driving in my car, the mapping software sucks, and the Geode is about as big as the Visor! And what¡s with that flashing light? Is that to put us all in a trance to make us think we have great unit? Or put us to sleep while waiting for the Geode to get a 3D fix? Send it back if you have the unit and don't buy it if you¡re thinking of doing so!"
1,The Geode ALMOST got 5 stars from me,"This product has SO MUCH potential, but unfortunately that's all it might EVER have - potential. It works MOST of the time, but a LOT of the advertised features aren't implemented yet and now it questionable whether they ever will get implemented, as the folks at GeoDiscovery are NOT answering their phones this week. There was earlier talk of layoffs at GeoDiscovery which have lately turned into rumors of the company going out of business. I know of more than several current customers who've been trying UNSUCCESSFULLY to contact GeoDiscover to get them to confirm/deny the rumors. It doesn't look good, for they aren't answering the phone, emails or returning voice mail messages...it's really a shame because the Geode promised to be BY FAR the best GPS unit available."
2,Two Star Rating,"Hello, I've had the Geode for a over a week now and it not only takes forever(well over ten minutes) to connect to satellites but I had a very hard time calibrating the compass. How many times should I turn around, ten? Also when I'm on the satellite screen, standing still, the GPS signal isn't working. Maybe they shouldn't have rushed this product onto the market. Perhaps that's why all of a sudden their back ordered (trying to fix all the ""bugs""). As for customer support, that doesn't exists. I give them a two star rating for their pathetic attempt to provide an unaffordable module that doesn't work! I'm sending my Geode back first thing tomorrow morning!"
1,I would have rated it lower - but can't,"This thing sucks. I was so excited the day it arrived too. I took it out of the box, plugged it in and it started right up. Just one problem, it would not lock on to enough satelites to ever get going.In all of my trips (about 5 now), the Geode has only been able to aquire a position on ONE. That's right - ONE. It is extremely picky, constantly needs to be reset, and in general - just does not work.Not to mention it sucks up batteries and, the software is buggy as heck.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,the worst customer support imaginable,"REad the reviews here (which I didn't) It has poor performance, and it does not comply to NEMA data, so don't bother trying to import your waypoints into a database. Besides, If you do buy it, don't every plan on hearing from customer service. I've been trying 6 months for a return, including trying to call and fax, and nothing. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS."
1,1 star is too much for the Geode,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I purchased a Geode from Geo Discovery, and regret my purchase. I cannot get any response from their customer relations. The Geo Discovery Tech Support phone number was pulled from their website. After 30 minutes, the Geode would not power on. I warn you, you should not purchase this awful excuse for a GPS."
2,Using the maps while DRIVING is a BIG obstacle!,"Using the maps while driving in my car is virtually impossible. No street maps, extremely slow routing, and constant map switches. Its impossible to tap on any street maps while driving to determine exactly where your location is. To top that off, I lost my satellite lock five times in a fifteen minute trip to the mini mart. The maps have too much detail, I was only able to put two maps on my visor. I don't have MMC cards, so there goes another expense. For three hundred dollars, you should be able too have a more practical module."
1,....,"I purchased my Geodiscovery in January, 2001 from Amazon.com. Overall the product is a great idea. The downside list is below. 1. Product will not power on anymore. 2. Warranty is for 1 year, no response from Geo. 3. When the product was working, they were never able to get the memory chips to work. This limited you to downloading maps to the Handspring (max 8megs). 4. Will you still be able to download the maps? .... 5. When you did download the maps the geo worked very slowly. 6. The overall map interface was not very good; they were starting to improve it in Version 1.3. 7. The WAAS system for getting a fix on your location did not appear to be as accurate as the web site claimed. Based on my experience I would not mix my Handspring with a global positioning device again. Maybe you will have better luck with it than I did."
1,Geodiscovery GPS Module,"I recently purchased this module. It would not lock up successfully. I tried circling, second story balcony. I did everything but stand on my head. I found it worthless since it would not lock up. It would lock on 2 satilletes then lose lock for no apparent reason."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"...The GeoDiscovery Geode is a horrible, horrible implementation of a very cool technology. I bought one to give to my wife on Mothers Day - boy was I embarassed when we started playing with it. It took 15 minutes to link up with an orbiter - all the while me looking like an idiot standing in the middle of the street holding the thing up at the sky (I was desperate for this thing to be as cool as their website made it out to be).So 20 days later I call to get an RMA to return the mostly defective product. Support line disconnected. Oh boy. Call their corporate/sales line... Every voicemail box number I keyed in had a full mailbox...."
4,the groom wore spurs,"excellent comedy of 1951 with ginger rogers and jack carson ( who had supporting roles in a number of ginger's early movies). They are both very funny, as is Joan Davis (of course) in a small role. Monochrome photography is brilliant and even though it is a minor film, it is genuinely very entertaining."
5,Buchanan Bros Music from way back!,"Hard to find music, glad to finally find it after all these years. Couldn't even find it on a 45. Thanks!"
3,Great Man - Disappointing Story,"The book was suggested by a bookshop owner from NY. She said that it was a 'Cool' book by Peter Maas and a 'must-read' before seeing the Pacino movie. Seeing the reviews by others, I'm wondering if i missed something... Everybody else has given it 5 stars.It's a story about an ordinary NY cop who had the resolve and strength to fight corruption. True, I salute Serpico and admire his character. People like Serpico are definitely historic figures when it comes down to changes in administration and policies. I don't know the current situation in NY - Is corruption stemmed now? I would assume that definitely Frank Serpico should have made a change.Without taking away any credit from the man who is the theme of the story, I would say the man who told the story (Maas) did not do justice. Given the opportunites for dramatization and emotional story telling, I think Maas let me down. Others may disagree.. But, I think it could have been a better story."
5,Another Good Book by Maas,I would recomend this book.It is well written and enjoyable to read.Serpico I believe is a hard person to write about so some of the fact are kind of fuzzy.What I would have liked to read is what happened to Serpico after he dissapeared.There is nothing in the book about this though.If you are interested in NYPD true stories this is the one to start with .There is another book that kind of goes with this one called Varnish Brass-the decade after Serpico it is by Barbra Gelb
4,"Great, but check out Pina Carmirelli's version too","The review of this version of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons (Simon Standage with The English Concert directed by Trevor Pinnock) dated December 22, 2003 by ""A Music Fan"" from San Diego, CA mentioned that you might want to check out the I Musici version too. (S)he is right. But (s)he misspelled the name of the soloist, Pina Carmirelli, causing me to hurle invective at the computer until I finally tracked it down. It's the version dated October 25, 1990, on the Philips Digital Classics label, ASIN: B0000040VO. And yeah, it's a doozy. You might want to own both. They're intriguingly different."
5,WOW,Wow! I don't know enough to say the right words. Read all the other reviews for details. It's amazing. The other versions I have are not even from the same planet.
1,One of the worst,"I don't know where these positive reviews come from. I'm used to the Perlman, Joshua Bell and Carmignola versions. This is just not in their league. The timing is off. The voicing is strange. It's like just another day at work. Sorry guys. This is not up to snuff."
1,Over polished,"From my perception, the English concert et al have no business interpreting the work of Vivaldi. I feel as though the artistic quality is removed when Vivaldi gets over polished. I'm not a fan of the Phillips recordings for that reason, even with Mozart. I have heard some really great recordings from the English with Mozart. When you try to over polish Vivaldi it dies. Vivaldi should be left to the masters of Concerto Italiano and Rinaldo Alessandrini, and the Venace Baroque Orchestra and Andrea Marcon. The purchaser for this would be someone who enjoys the substance of very polished classical interpretations."
4,works as described,"easy to install. Five inch opening does not allow connection to 4 inch hose, but I have a complete chip removal system, so 5 inch hose was planned for this connection. Not flimsy as some have stated and I've had mine for years and at $28, it is not overpriced IMO"
5,Great and Rare find,"Great movie, great action and as good as any other Audie Murphy western you've seen. This is rare to find and have never seen this on TV, Cable(TMC or AMC channels) This is well worth the price and DVD is clear as day. As with my other Audie Murphy review, I wish they could just release all of his westerns on DVD. Many of Murphy's westerns are unavailable on either DVD or only available in [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - France]"
4,the quick gun,"I am a great fan of audie murphy , pity there isn't more audie movies available.I have always liked the quick gun and was pleased to be able to purchase this movie from your good range of westerns .The Quick Gun is a formular audie western with audie saving the town from outlaws led by ted de corsiaAs in most audie westerns , great colour , widescreen , plenty of action ."
3,Cute Flip Flops,"These are really cute flip flops, but I am only giving them 3 stars b/c of the comfort. These are definately not ones I can put on and wear all day w/o my feeting hurting."
5,bravo,Bravo to Ms. Washington for blowing the lid off a problem that is talked about constantly in private but only rarely in public.
3,Hibiscus,This book is written for those gardeners who can grow hibiscus outdoors. Container gardening of this plant is discussed but it is not the main focus. Recommended only for hibiscus growers in the southern US.
5,Comprehansive Book,"This is a comprehansive hibiscus book. The writer shares her knowledge on most types of Hibiscus. From the history of hibiscus to taking care of hibiscus, growing from seed or cuttings. The photos in the book are excellent.I recommend this book for everyone who are interested in Hibiscus and growing hibiscus outdoors or indoors."
3,sound good but no exchange option for broken tweeter,These tweeters sound great but a week after installing them one of the tweeters just stopped working it didn't blow it just turned off. I swapped them to make sure it wasn't my connection and it wasn't. Now this normally wouldn't bother me I know stuff comes from the factory messed up some times. The thing that bugged me is that I cant just exchange them (or just one) for another pair. I would have to return them wait for a refund and then order a new pair this seems a little ridiculous to me.
3,"great sound, poor design","great sound, really brings out the high end of the music. disapointed the the way they mount, surface mounded mine and the speakers really don't mount into the holder very well. I've had them pop out quite a few times now. May end up glueing them in."
5,This book is a MUST HAVE!!,"This book is very informative and provides the ""inside scoop"" from an ""inside man."" I really enjoyed this book and I highly recomend it to anyone interested in getting ""Inside the Recording Studio."""
4,"A very good ""how to"" book for the beginner!","I found this book to be a very good explanation--from technical to personal aspects--of what really goes on inside a recording studio; and I recommend it to anyone interested in recording, from demos to master sessions."
4,Writing Pen,Coming from someone that writes between 20 and 40 letters a week. This pen is comfortable in the hand and has a good even flow. I would recommend this product for anyone that does a great deal of handwritten correspondence.
4,"Very nice, but limited","You only have the one size to write with and you can't put the cap on the other end, but it works well and you can put a spare cartridge in the inside if you position it right."
4,Not a good fit for my band saw,"I bought the Delta 28-206 14"" enclosed base band saw, and the Platinum accessory package which included the 50-274 mobile base. There were instructions on how to assemble the base, but not on how to attach it to my band saw. It looked like it was supposed to replace the 4"" thick base that came with the saw, but it didn't fit. It was about a 1/4"" to narrow for the band saw base to fit in it. I solved it by putting the regular base back on, and drilling holes in it to bolt the mobile base to the standard base. With 8 bolts holding it in place it is solid enough, but its about 4 inches higher than normal. Since I'm a tall guy its not a problem for me. The mobile base is still a great idea though. I have a standard 2 car garage for a shop, so the ability to move my stuff around is really important. This base works like a dream. I'd recommend it, just be aware you may have to do a few modifications to mount your equipment."
1,save your money,"If like me, you are considering buying this so your 5G 60GB video ipod fits better in an older product that did not come with the proper adaptor, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! The adaptors for 4G ipods that came with my JBL On Time and RadioShack Accurian dock hold my ipod more securely than these adaptors, supposedly designed by Apple specifically for the 60 GB iPod with Video."
5,Insightful,"What we have here is someone who understands implicitly the commonalities found across the faiths and systems. The Afro-Carribean religions arose from just that, and this work helps explain this most important point."
2,Interesting but Outdated,"Don't believe the other reviewers when they tell you this book will teach you how to use the ""Hay system"" (whatever they mean by that). It has nothing to do with Guide Charts and doesn't teach you how to use the Culture Sort analysis (although it does list the culture attributes, which could enable you to figure out the model is you know what you are doing and have experience in this).The most important take-away from this book is how business culture affects your remuneration structures.Written in 1995/6, the book is definitely outdated. ALL companies are moving to a ""process based"" system and reducing the benefits component of remuneration. You don't need a book or Hay consultant to tell you that.The book is fairly easy reading with a good index. It lacks extensive 'war strories' which show application of the principles."
5,I Love This Thing!!,"This product is pretty much amazing!! I use it on my brows, and it helps when I use little baby scissors to cut excess hair from my eyebrows. It helps all my eyebrow hairs go the same way so I don't look weird and crazy. I also will use it on my lashes sometimes if they get clumped together, it's a lifesaver! I carry this everywhere.. great for any girl."
5,This is the CD is you're throwing a party,LOVE this CD......don't let the picture at the top fool you. Check the tracks on the CD.....you won't go wrong if you want to hear some old school tracks w/SERIOUS bass!
4,Vinyl Vent,For what it is it works great and installs easily but if you are considering this vent you should also consider the aluminum vent options. We have it installed with fiber cement siding and while it looks okay it does not look as good as an aluminum vent would have looked trimmed out with 5/4 stock. If you are using with vinyl siding it would look fine.
2,Broken at exactly one month,"I bought this product for the simple fact that it was the only offering in the high grit range, to care for a recently purchased knife. Now after exactly one month of use, it has broken. Not from any sort of impact other than regular use. Before the break I had been completely satisfied, but at this price it isn't worth returning. I guess you get what you pay for"
4,Purchased on the merit of other reviews,"I'm a professional, so I'm a little disappointed with the size of it, but it does put a nice clean edge on an otherwise sharp knife. I've used it moderately heavily and it isn't quite what it was when it was new, but it's still better than the metal honing steel every pro kitchen has laying around. Ceramic is where it's at."
4,Works well,"The handle is a bit small and cheap looking, but it seems to do the job well and is less expensive than similar sharpeners."
3,Came highly recommended,"I have not used this yet, and it is very very light which surprised me. I got this to supplement a Victorinox set I bought here. I got great recommendations and the price was right."
5,Good sharpener.,"This sharpener is my first of this type. Previously, I used the pull through type. I like this style much better. It is not too aggressive and produces a nice sharp edge."
1,Almost pointless!,A cheap product!Barely sharpens. Almost pointless. Am going to have to buy another. Very dissapointing!An old one from Ikea worked better.
3,iowa_vinyl_mod,"CD is pretty cool...some tunes have been on a ton of these compilations, but a few are quite rare and enjoyable. A few tracks are pretty lo-fi, but depending on your tastes this could be a plus or minus!"
2,I have never read the book...,"and I admit I did watch it only for Eddie Izzard's performance as the Russian emmissary, AND I DID find it difficult to stay awake....BUT the performances are wonderful all around. Christian Bale is impressive, Robin Williams is delightful, and Bob Hoskins is charming. This dark drama is engaging, as long as you pour yourself a cup of coffee before settling in to watch it."
1,Amazing Cast-Weak Movie,"Secret Agent was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams, Bob Hoskins, Christian Bale, and Patricia Arquette among others.The movie brings to the screen the story of an Englishman, living with his young wife and her retarded brother in the city of London. Things, however, are not as they seem in 19th Century London, with spies, double agents, anarchists and revolutionaries having a field day...In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average.The movie has that Sherlock Holmes feel about it, but without the ""magic,"" meaning that in the end you are left... numb, and wondering: ""Was that it?""As for the rating, it could have been PG-13.Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off. A shame really..."
4,The Secret Agent.,I bought this DVD for three reasons.1. I knew everyone in the cast and all were excellent.2. I love the music of Philip Glass.3. I like this movie very much.
2,Alright,A nostalgic sleepy and literate period piece spy drama that periodically captures your attention when least expected. Not as stimulating as one could imagine but nevertheless credible.
3,An Underrated Film,"Although this film has gotten some terrible reviews, it is well executed overall, and as faithful an adaptation of Conrad's story as you're likely to see. It is let down a bit by slow pacing and a very wooden performance by Patricia Arquette, but the rest of the cast is fine, especially an unbilled Robin Williams, who normally bothers me. I recommend THE SECRET AGENT mainly to those who are familiar with the original story, and those who enjoy British period melodrama. The DVD is of fine quality and played with no problems on my machine."
5,Wash Me!,"I've got to throw in here and say this album is a doosy. These guys cheer me up in my darkest moments of despair, while doing dishes, dusting bookshelves, and what not. It makes me want to put on a tight, old t-shirt and converse shoes and drive around town in a chop-top Datsun B210 with big Elton John glasses. If I had a Datsun B210, I'd never get any cleaning done. Lincoln! Emancipate yourself."
2,Great while it works! Just not very long.,"If you want a great power washer that runs for about two years then this is your model. We bought this at Costco for a great price. Loved it. We've used it about oh 20 times over the past two years and it did a great job. Then, it just lost all pressure. We took it to a small engine repair place and he showed us the graveyard for these power washers, all of them with engine problems. It would cost more to replace the engine than go and buy another one. Boy were we disappointed. It wasn't an obscure problem. We're now in the market for a good one with a track record of reliability and longevity. Good luck!"
1,Fine when it works...,"I've had this scanner for less than 6 months and it's worked less than half of the time. It began giving me problems 8 weeks after I bought it by making a heinous clicking sound instead of scanning. I've tried to email Umax 3 times and have been ignored each time. I'm not usually one to dog a company in public, but this is worth noting. I've been using Umax scanners for 5 years and this is my first problem, but it unfortunately makes me wary of dealing with them again in the future."
3,no extra charge for the crumbs?,"I love Keebler cookies and these chocolate-mint covered grahams are a long time favorite so I thought getting 6 packages at once would be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the box must have gotten some hard knocks in transit because each and every package arrived with about a quarter of the cookies magically transformed to cookie-dust!!!As much as I love the brand and this flavor, I doubt I'll re-order them. From here on I'll probably just rely on getting one package at a time from the market..."
4,Closest thing to 70s Girl Scout Fudge Patties I've found yet--Keebler Fudge Filled Cookies,"For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story. The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past. The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.For the uninitiated: this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge. The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.Serving suggestion: Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby."
3,Way too sweet for me.,"The sugar content is more than I thought it would be, wow, are these sweet. I love sugar, but not that much, in my desserts."
5,Slipper you will love!,"Great slipper for a great price through Amazon.Fast shipping, good communication and great price. Will buy from them again."
4,ORDER TWO SIZES UP!!!!!,"I read the reviews and they weren't kidding! I ordered one size larger than I usually wear, but two would have been even better. These do fit narrow and I have narrow feet so they are comfy for me (and VERY warm!!!), but I don't see how someone with wide feet would even be able to get them on. Buyer beware, but if you have the right kind of foot they will feel very fluffy and luxurious!"
2,Very Dissappointed! :(,I purchased these for myself after several family members aid how much they loved their Uggs! Well The left foot has a large lump in the front part of the slipper that is very irritating! They are also not wearing very well! I usually buy Minnetonka slippers and they has always held up so well and been very soft and cozy with no issues. I will go back to my Minnetonka's after this. :( These are way overpriced for the quality!
4,Great Gift,Bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves them.Good quality materials and they keep her feet toasty !
2,Slippers,"These are not as comfortable as I'd expect for the price. I'm not getting the hoopla about Uggs, but thought I'd try them. Think I'll buy my totes again this year!"
4,Great comfy slipper,Second time I have owned a pair of these slippers and they do not disappoint! My shipment came fast and quality is great! Would recommend!
5,great and cozy shoes,I just love them. They are so warm and cozy in these cold winter times. I ordered them in the same size as my UGG boots and the size is fine.
5,Great slipper,This is my second pair. I wore my first ones out! They are very warm and comfortable. Hard to find in the stores. Easy to order through Amazon.
1,too small,The slippers are not sized correctly - too small.UGG Australia Women's Scuffette Slippers FootwearBought my wife the product for Christmas and now we have to figure out what to do.
1,Mortal Kombat: Conquest,The Copy listed above has wrong information. PAL? Region 1? That does not match. What is the correct information?
5,DELTA PLANER BLADES,DELTA 22-677 15-INCH PLANER KNIVES CAME IN EARLIER THAN THE PROJECTED DELIVERY TIME SCHEDULED AND WERE EXACTLY AS ORDERED. I WOULD ORDER AGAIN.
3,Childrens party treasure hunt,The book contains some basic ideas for a treasure hunt. In my opinion there is nothing really new. The ideas can be easily adapted for different age groups. May be useful to get started with your own ideas. It really is a beginner's guide.
5,happy,I appreciated how fast I received the products and how sharp the knives were.Thank you very much.
4,Knives,These are very good planner knives for the money. Nothing unique or special about them. Once they dull either re-sharpen or buy new.
3,easy install,"These knives are an easy install, which is good because they aren't the best metal for edge retention!"
5,I deeply appreciate this book!,"This is a fantastic find! I tried to find the artist, so I could tell her directly, being so inspired by her words. I am an artist and usually become bored with most art books (except for the pictures). This book touched my soul and gaves me a clarity that I had lost and was looking for. Thank you, Ms Sperry wherever you are, for your words, your heart & your truth about what art is!"
5,212 Views of Central Park : Experiencing New York City's Jewel From Every Angle,Excellent book! I have purchased several for visiting friends and family.
4,"Strong machine, but...","This is a fine machine, very solid. I have been surprised about how many uses I have found for it. With the appropriate belt or disk, it even works well on light metal work. I have used it to quickly deburr and straighten my wood lathe tool rests. Works like a charm, and much quicker than hand-filing. My only gripe? WHY does it NOT include a dust collection hookup for the disk? The belt sander has a very effective dust port. The disk just has an oval hole in the bottom going nowhere. At first I jury-rigged a way to plumb that hole to the outside world, but then I got mad about having to do so and called Delta. The tech fellow was sympathetic and gave me the part number for the dust collector kit (50-224). But why should I have to pay another $37 for what ought to be a standard item? Well, I paid the $$ and now have a complete machine. And I'm very happy with it."
3,"Not bad, but only if you're new to Postman.","The book probably is a good summary of Neil Postman's ideas if you're new to him, but if you've already read his major works there's not much here to recommend. In fact, some of the ideas and even the prose can be pretty slack at times. Should pique the interest of newcomers, however."
1,This is no home inspection guide - That's for sure,Members of the national home inspection company I belong to have to take yearly tests to keep up to date with expertise. We are allowed to read home inspection books for extra credits so I can tell you that I read at least 3-5 books per year for home inspectors. This book is NOT a home inspection guide for anyone who knows what they're talking about. It's far too limited in it's scope and I did not learn anything from reading it.
2,A let down.,"First of all, I want to start out by saying that a product obviously will bring out different results, on everyone. While this did not work for me, it may produce great results for others. It does smell nice and it's a fairly nice consistency. But MY personal experience was that I noticed a huge difference in my hair, in the way of terrible, terrible static electricity. I do, in fact, contribute the SE to this conditioner. I can say that with certainty, because the results were absolutely immediate! With that being said, while I won't be using this again, others should give it a fair try. It really smells good. It's just not for my particular head of hair! :-)"
5,Much better than the stock speakers!!!!,I was not looking for the ultimate sound experience rather the stock speakers were blown and needed to be replaced. I decided on the Polks because I have installed the Polk brand in my house where I was looking for the ultimate experience and was VERY satisfied with their products. While I realize I could have purchased speakers for half the price it is not worth the risk when you go through so much effort to do the install anyway. If you consider that you will have these speakers for many years the difference between $30 and $60 does not add up to much. I did not install a new head unit or add a sub but I will say that these speaker really sound great and have much better base response than I expected.
4,It's OK,"Those speakers of course are much better than db651s but still overpriced. I get equal or better sound from $37 Pioneers. Also, they didn't quite fit my 6.5', spent very long time adjusting it."
3,Do not fit 2001 Toyota Sienna doors,"These 6.5"" speakers are too small to fit the doors in my 2001 Toyota Sienna LE. The supplied plastic adapter is too large. I returned these (at my expense) and will be trying a 6.75"" size next.After ordering I checked the Amazon.com car speaker finder tool, and it says these speakers will fit my model. It is incorrect. The speakers seem fine, but the website is lacking."
3,Entry level speakers,"With most speaker manufactures they do have an entry level product to help capture all price points.This is polks entry level, affordable replacement for most stock applications, remember with most speakers you get what you pay for and this is one of those cases, if you can afford better spend a little more and be happy,these are a little on the lightweight sideWith small magnets and they lack in the lower end frequency response."
4,Check your polarity,"I put these in both front and back speaker locations of a 2011 non-bose chevy avalanche. I used the metra 72-4568 speaker harnesses and the scoshce sagmhr634 brackets available here. The install was straight forward - you just got to make sure you keep your polarity straight as I initially reversed one speaker going by colors instead of what is written on the harness. When I fixed the problem, the sound greatly improved. They are much clearer than the stock speakers, and they sound better & better the more you break them in (this is important, because they don't sound great for the first few hours of life). I put a little dynamat under the brackets to prevent rattle, and these speakers come with a foam bracket. I believe all I need is a basslink for a nice under $350 total upgrade using the factory head unit, but I can wait a little as these are definitely better."
4,Good replacements. Not bad.,"Bought based on reviews and price to upgrade my oem on a 08 vibe. Speakers looked solidly built. Sound a lot clearer but not the really big difference i hoped for, maybe need time to brake in?? or me to hear. Polk Audio DB651 $58.25Went to fry's later and compared DB6501 component and these and knew I should have bought components to upgrade. Huge difference when listening to components and these coax. Its like nite and day. If you want the big **upgrade** get components.UPDATE = Speakers keep getting better. Im starting to like them a lot more than when first installed. Good choice."
3,Lack depth if mounted horizontaly,"I installed these in the roll bar a 2009 Jeep wrangler with a stock head unit and Polk Audio DB6501 components in the front, and I have to say these sound very lacking in depth and somewhat tinny compared to the Polk Audio DB6501 components. Heck, these almost sound as bad as the stock speakers. I believe these are good speakers but I must be doing something wrong, I have them mounted, in a sense, upside down and this may be why they sound so lacking. they came with some great brackets that made it very easy to install, and they look sharp, but none of that matters once I turn en on. If I was buying speakers again I would not buy these."
3,Below expectation yet an ok speaker,"After reading positive reviews and seeing a sale on this item I decided to give them a try.They were installed into a 2004 VW Jetta - they fit fine there was no fit issue at all.If I has known ahead of time I would have bought speaker enclosures that protect the speakerswhen they are installed into the door - (a thin plastic or rubber enclosure).After listening to the system, I was a little undrewhelmed by the sound of the speakers.The sound is a little muddy and not as clear as I would have hoped.The car has the monsoon system (favtory amp) so I was expecting the speaker wouldperform much better and live up to my expectations based on other reviews that I read on these DB-651s.My factory speakers were partially blown, so the systems sounds much much better than before the installationbut just not quite as good as I was hoping."
3,Maybe sounds more full with an amp?,"I put these polks in a 2000 Honda Accord EX. The highs are crisp and clear and the bass is tight, but my system just doesn't have a that full sound anymore. The mids are lacking and the bass doesn't kick in until I turn up the volume and bass. I'm sure these sound much better with nice receiver and amp, but I'm a cheap fuddy duddy and was simply looking to replace my front factory speakers because one was blown out. I'm a little disappointed I didn't pick something else that would have worked better with my factory stereo and factory rear speakers. I was swayed by all the positive reviews to spend the extra $20-$30 on these polks. BTW - get the metra speaker wire connector/adapters as they made the speaker install slick. Don't bother messing with cutting and crimping/sodering the wires. It's not worth the effort as the adapters are pretty cheap."
4,Great Speakers,For the price I paid these are great sounding speakers. Look really nice and sound very clear. Using them in my boat.
5,My fav car speakers,"I love the 651's, their just great car speakers! I have used them in other car installs and they always sound great. Plenty of low, mid and highs. It's just a well balanced speaker."
2,"Too much treble, not enough bass.","These speakers are too bright and tinny for my tastes. Too much treble and not enough bass, even when I adjusted for it at the receiver end. I did not find them to be better than the stock speakers on my Honda."
2,hmmph,where to start .... first off the company sent 5 1/4 inch speakers but return shipping was free. When the correct speakers came they were in a destroyed box that was covered with a black bag and tape. pretty horrible presentation.and after installation i found that the tweeter housing was broken and vibrating when playing music loudly. i had to krazy glue the tweeter housing (which no longer can be aimed or directed) but the speakers sound great. slight damage on metal rim of speaker as well. They are very sensitive and deliver dynamic sound however suffered from lack of care during storage or shipping. who's to blame? merchandiser or delivery? i don't know.This is my second review on these speakers ... last time i gave the same review and the merchandiser wanted me to change it in exchange for some time share weekend vacation... no thanks. not sure how my previous review was deleted.great price .....
1,Not actually 6.5 inches,"These speakers which are advertised as 6.5 inch are actually 5.5 inches, the adapter ring doesn't work for my application, so now I'll have to custom fabricate a plate to install them in my truck. I've read that the sound quality is decent so I'm going to go ahead with the installation and find out for myself, I just wanted to make sure that other people know the truth about these speakers size before they buy."
1,This speakers are overrated and overpriced!,"I don't hate them, but they are so overrated that I had to give it 1 star instead of 2 or 3.If I had known that the speakers would sound like that, I would have never paid more than $25 or $30 for it.They definitely sound better than no speakers at all, but there is very little bass, lots of distortion at medium volumeand the overall sound is way below my expectations after reading those nice reviews.Moreover, they are not ""easy to install"" as my factory speakers are.I do not recommend it to anyone who's looking for an inexpensive loud high-quality clean sound."
5,Love these.,"Great product, sounds amazing, and im always getting compliments on my sound system. Buy them if you want great sounding audio. Very loud and very minimal distortion. <3"
4,Excellent Sound,Already a Polk Audio fan. Used to replace the same speaker that lasted 10 years in my Toyota Tundra pickup truck.
2,Good sound but poor build quality.,"I purchased a set of these a while back but only recently installed them but both speakers have issues. The problem is that the big black transistor I guess, on both of these broke off at the solder connection. So I had to buy an iron and soldered them both back on and they worked again. However now one broke off again and unfortunately its right where the thin black wire goes into the transistor itself so I don't know what luck I will have getting that fixed. Once I installed these I never touched them again so I don't know why this same part keeps breaking. Would not buy again."
5,Nice Pick-up,I purchased these speakers for my 2002 GMC Envoy to go with a small JVC 2-channel amplifier and another pair of Alpine SPS-600 speakers in the rear doors. The Polk clearly out perform the Alpine speakers. Plenty of bass for an average user and the highs are good too. The price is always right at Amazon.
2,Didn't install,"I bought these a few years ago on Amazon and just now got around to putting them in my 96 Camry this morning. I first replaced the stock radio with a Sony MEX-BT4000P (decent stereo) and a couple of new Kenwood speakers (KFC-1654S) for the rear. So far, so good.Then I put a Polk DB651 in one of the doors and turned on the stereo. The Camry's stock Fujitsu 15w 4ohm speaker in the other front door sounded clearer, had more bass and had a fuller, richer sound. I tried several stations, the aux in and bluetooth as audio sources, but the Polk sounded tinny in comparison. I cranked up the stereo so it was very loud, turned up the bass on the equalizer, but the old Fujitsu sounded better. The rear Kenwoods KFC-1654S also sounded better than the Polk, but maybe not as good as the Fujitsu speaker. I'm keeping the Fujitsu speakers in the car.I bought these Polks based on the reviews here. Good thing they were on sale, about $27 or $29 at the time."
4,Great Value For The Price,"I've had these speakers since April, 2011. I got them on sale through Amazon, and they are definitely worth the money. The speakers were easy enough to install. They are a little on the high side, with high hats and other high pitched instruments being very crisp and clear. The bass is definitely worth mentioning though, I've had a few friends ask me if I had subs.Overall, I would recommend this product for the price!"
5,Best Bang for the buck,"The Polk DB series is awesome. I ordered the 6.5"" Polk DBs to replace my 5.25"" Jeep Wrangler Soundbar factory speakers. The difference in sound is just amazing. The clarity of the highs and the deeper bass response is truly a wonderful sound. One of the the reasons I purchased these speakers is due to the high end waterproof/marine rating. Perfect for a Jeep Wrangler. I've had all kinds of speakers in varies vehicles; Sony Xplod, Pioneer, MB Quart, Kickers, and many others. The Polk DBs are my favorite by far and Amazon has the best price. You can't go wrong with these speakers. Buy Them!!"
2,Dated; Really pushes the Medications,"Written and updated way back in 1997; would have been better to have the latest information on the medicines in the intervening 10 years. His insistence on pushing the anti-anxiety medications - despite their addictive qualities - made me uncomfortable. He also seems disdainful of alternative methods of treating/overcoming anxiety/panic disorders. I had hoped to really like his book and find it useful and reassuring, but instead, I felt annoyed at reading it - as if the author was arrogant with his opinions and attitude about treatment options. I cannot recommend this book."
2,"Odd, brief, and unoriginal.","This odd book begins with the author, a psychiatrist, telling the tale of his inability to diagnose his own panic disorder, and then running off to the hospital repeatedly for useless EKG's thinking he was having a heart attack. Then in one of the more glaring non-sequitors ever typed onto a page, the balance of this thin book is a rant against non-MD mental health care providers, psychologists and MSW's especially, who shouldn't, he believes, be used to diagnose panic attacks, an ordinary disorder this psychiatrist himself couldn't diagnose. He does make some good points for the use of benzodiazepines, but errs repeatedly in his self-myth that the disorder cannot be cured. Something behavioral psychologists do daily. There are many books available that give the reader a good picture of both how one has acquired this disorder and how one may get rid of it. Unfortunately this is not one of them."
5,Good Product,"These 1/4"" crown staples worked well in my Porter Cable stapler -- no jams or problems."
5,Extremely pleased,"Best value for the money. I always investigate my purchases first for any complains and price comparison. This bike passed on both issues so I gave it a shot. It arrived in less than a week and took me about 2 hrs to assemble and understand the programs. I recommend you carefully read ALL the assembly instructions and take your time putting it together. It was initially confusing but made sense when I focused on each assembly step (who says men don't read instructions???). I use it daily and felt the difference within the first week. I'd recommend this product, and my shopping experience with Amazon, to everyone."
1,Terrible Review for ABFM,"Based on the publisher, writers credentials, number of pages, ""fast facts"" review style, etc. I thought this would be great for ABFM prep. Unfortunately, the text is FILLED with typos and has a substantial amount of frankly incorrect medical information! One particular example: the orthopedics section is horribly inaccurate with respect to many fractures. I gave it 1 star for the ""fast facts"" style format, but I can NOT recommend it.I found McGraw-Hills 'Family Practice Examination and Board Review' by Jason K. Wilbur et al. excellent(but requires a substantial time commitment.) Additionally, I reviewed my residency ABFM practice exams, Crush Step 3, and a few other books. Good Luck."
2,TOO SMALL!,"Although they look nice they are way too small. I guess they made them to fit on the train, but I was hoping they would be able the stand them up and handle them through pretend play. I was disappointed. I also ordered the caribou and they are a nice size for pretend play."
4,Too much for too little,I read some of the reviews on how small the figurines were. The figurines are adorable...but they are definitely overpriced. My 6 year ol girl loved them!
5,A gift,"This was a gift for a friends child. He already had the Polar Express train set, so I got him a few more accesories."
1,High price - LOW quality!,I purchased the add-on figures for the O-Gauge Lionel Polar Express Train set (which stopped working after about 6 times of use). The quality for the price is LOW. I had to repair the little boy after his body came apart when I turned his head (it's supposed to be movable - more like breakable!) We're returning everything Lionel back to Amazon. I thought Lionel was a quality model train manufacturer... it's not. And everything is made in China! Buyer beware!
1,Not Worth The Money,The item is way over priced. I paid $32 for four small figures and it feels like I paid $30 too much. The figures also don't attach to the train like the ones that come with it. The hole in the figures are just a little too big and end up falling off.
2,Over priced,They are cute but simply way too expensive. They should sell for about a third of what I paid for them.
2,VERY TINY LITTLE FIGURES,"Beware! These figures are very small. They are well made in that the arms and legs move but they are extremely tiny. My son enjoys putting them on the Polar Express train he received. If I had realized how small these were going to be I would not have paid $27 for one package (paid $84 total for 2 packages of figures and one package of caribou). I felt like I had been ripped off, but the dimensions are listed, so I guess I should have paid more attention. Never in a million years would I have thought these figures were going to be so small."
3,Not durable for play,"These toys look quite nice and are constructed in such away to promote movement. Unfortunately, as a result, they come apart quite easily and are difficult to put back together. If you have kids, plan on reassembling these with regularity."
1,"Ridiculosly Overpriced,",$28 plus shipping for 4 plastic figures each about 2 inches tall! Do not be fooled by the super enlarged pictures in the item description. I am guessing Lionel makes about $27.50 in profit from selling a set of these for $28.
1,Waste of money,"I purchased the Lionel Polar Express Train as a decoration to circle our Christmas Tree. The train itself was fine. However, I also purchased these figures to add on. They are not worth the money. There are places on the train where these figures are supposed to snap in and fit, but it does not work. In the end, the figures just lie on the floor and you regret spending the money."
4,Great book!,"A well written book that managed to hold my attention. Good, understandable technical explanations and fascinating tales of organizational intrigue. Important lessons for anyone taking part in complex development projects. The acchievements described are quite mindboggling. As I have been personally involved in naval command and control development, and am a naval technology freak, I found this book extremely interesting.A bit long for a casual read, but easily lends to skipping around."
5,Delightful,"If you haven't yet discovered the pleasures of R.K. Narayan, I highly recommend The Financial Expert. It is nothing less than a classic. Superbly written, with humorously human characters and a well observed story. We follow the successes and of Margayya, the ""financial expert"" who lives in Narayan's fictional Malgudi. His story is amusing and entertaining. Narayan is a wonderful writer. Enjoy."
5,the buffseeds are now iko,"""if you loved the BUFFSEEDS with lead singer kieran scragg, you will love iko, their new band. the BUFFSEEDS ""sparkle me, sung in kierans' high plaintive voice actually makes me cry in it's beauty. but that's the buffseeds. who i believe stand in a category of their own, a special place in the world of music. ok IKO, get the CD with extra tracks! there are treasures t in this CD also. ""numbers"" kills me. a new album ""ludo says hi"" is now out for download. i could go on, but why spoil the surprise? what moRe can i say?"""
2,An overview of Executive Protection,"Basically a reveiw of the highpoints of Executive Protection, of general interest to those who are considering employing a professional. Not rich in detail for those working in the profession."
4,A classic recording of these works,"If you want a low energy recording where everything sounds the same, buy the Tafelmusik recording. If you want an enthusiastic recording with mainstream tempos, this is the recording to get. Pinnock's harpsichord playing (wonderfully audible and solid) in No.5 and Simon Standage's violin playing in No.4 (3rd mvmt) are highlights."
1,Avoid this tool,"I got this saw for Christmas 12/00. It was a beast to assemble. The directions do not include a close up, detailed image or even an accurate description of how to install the blade and you'll need that as breaking blades will become habitual and if your new to scrolling forget about those skinny fine cutting blades this saw spits them out in seconds. I've had this tool for 4-mos. and still can't do anything with it that my jigsaw can't do better & quicker. Quick change blade, not! Cheezy platic parts, yes!"
2,Tension Trouble,"Got the saw a month ago and after 2 hours of use the tip of the upper arm actually broke off. I was sure that it had been a bad casting because there were many small holes visable in the break of the metal. I returned the saw and got another. I had all kinds of trouble getting enough tension on the blade, then last night a small rubber disk popped out from under the tip of the upper arm. I took the tension assembly all apart and re-inserted the rubber disk now the tension is very good. Expensive blades make it a pretty good saw, cheap blades make it a poor saw. The hold down is no good and in the way. The sawdust blower is way too weak. It is noisey but I do not have a vibration problem even though I have not bolted it down. I do not think that any scroll saw is problem free and with all these noted problems it is still a lot of fun."
1,28 volt Milwaukee impact wrench,I was already warned about how heavy this impact wrench is by other reviewers. I was hoping for a wrench that really had a lot of torque. I was very disappointed when I compared it with my 18 volt Znex. The Milwaukee wouldn't loosen bolts even with a freshly charged battery that the Znex would. I sadly returned it and am still in search of a stronger cordless impact wrench. The eighteen volt Bosh says it will deliver 500 plus pounds of torque. Maybe it is a better tool.
4,"|A poignant read - sad, but also inspiring","A sad, sometimes frustrating, but very moving and eventually uplifting read. By frustrating, I refer not to Ashworth's very readable style, but rather to some of the events that she describes in the book. I was almost hoping for her to murder one of her 'fathers' or have their van crash into a tree! I really felt the horror and felt sickened by the on-going abuse the author suffered, and was gladdened to see her overcome the dark times in her childhood. A must read."
2,"Well written, but over and over and over again","While the writing is very good--sometimes squeaky clean and crisp and other times blurry and smoky--I found the story to be too much of the same. How many times do I need to read a version, albeit well told, of ""he came home drunk, he beat up mum, we were all petrified"". Some repetition I think can serve the storytelling, but too much is just venting.Because the writing was good enough to keep me going, I hoped for more info, more ""new story"" to crop up. I wanted to know more about these people--really these women--besides their bloody battles with the mostly lone men in their lives."
3,Depressing but Uplifting in Spirit,"Andrea Ashworth's book is testament to the strength in the human spirit. I was going backwards and forwards between feeling repulsed by her mother's inaction to being amazed at the coping strategies and abilities of Ashworth and her sister's. I feel it hard to swallow that at the end of the book Ashworth thanked her mother for her spirit, etc. I wonder what has happened since the book was published and whether her mother has recognised how she has failed her children. Her 'blindness' and selfishness was astounding. Ashworth's book was interesting also due to tha fact that it was based in Manchester and it was a valuable social commentary and insight into what parts of the city was like before. A must read for everyone to wake up to the fact of how prevalent abuse is in society and how it manages to escape people who choose to look the other way."
5,An extraordinary book written with warmth and humour,"I thoroughly recommend this book which charts the childhood of its author Andrea Ashworth. Although a memoir, the style is almost fictional, vivid, funny and moving. When Andrea is five, her father drowns. Two stepfathers reveal themselves to be capable of immense selfishness and great cruelty. However Once in a House on Fire is not simply the story of a poor and violent childhood. Brilliantly written, its warmth and humour conjure up the colours, tastes and smells of what it was like to grow up in the seventies in the north of England (with a brief stint in Canada). Andrea narrates from the perspective of the ages she writes about, spanning five to eighteen. Blessed with imagination and a love of books, stories were her escape, metaphorically and in the end, literally."
4,Life seen thru the eyes of a kid as he become a man,"I have not finish this book yet but I like it ...the language is simple , direct, descriptive , detailed and realistic. Recommended for the non fiction reader"
5,Excellent Memoir,"This book is a joy to read and laugh out loud funny in places. The journey the writer takes is both poignant and hilarious, and manages to both respect and care about some pretty irresponsible, but totally lovable, characters."
4,Unusual Story,"I'm not sure if I enjoyed the story or writing more. The story is disjointed like the life of the narrator, but the pages flow nicely and I'm very happy I read it."
3,It didn't resonate with me,"I read and really liked his bookOpen: An Autobiography (Vintage)with Andre Agassi. Open is the best sports memoir I've ever read. Absolutely brilliant.Because of this, I was really excited to read The Tender Bar. I was disappointed. While it kept my interest, at no time was I really glued to the story. The characters, besides the main character, weren't that interesting to me. It was a definite disappointment."
4,beach reading you won't feel guilty about,this is a great page turner that deals with the real things in life. the writer is a journalist so it is free of writerly pretension and long boring passengers full of flashy flowery prose that doesn't move the story around. but that's not to say it's not an insightful book.
3,Well written but self indulgent,"This is a very well written book that held my interest; however, I couldn't help to feel that the writer was using the book for his own catharsis. The book, while a compelling read, was just too self indulgent to give it more stars."
2,"Depressing, boring","i give the book two stars because the writing is exceptional compared to many other books I have read. However, I could not get through it. I found it very boring and depressing."
3,Cheap entertainment,"Simply written, easy to read and follow. Not great, but good. I think the author gets the point across, in an entertaining way."
5,An excellent read,Friends recommended me to read this compelling story of born loser. I read it; it reads more like a novel than an autobiography. I passed on this reader tip; everyone was enchanted by the book.
5,Cheers for JR Moehringer,"This and Mary Karr's The Liar's Club are the best memoirs I have read to date. J.R. Moehringer's story is a dark, smoky, evolving, coming of age in a bar with a bunch of loveable, eccentric drunks. His bar ""fathers"" and ""uncles"" were priceless and I wound up loving every one. Moehringer struggled with growing up as much as he admits struggling with how to capture it on paper. In my estimation, he has done both exquisitely."
4,"Great storytelling, but is it a ""for real"" non-fiction memoir.","As a former LI bar hopper of the 1960's(the drinking age was only 18 in NY then) I agree with at least one other reviewer, in the feeling that the story was in some parts embellished with fiction. That is not to say this isn't a well told insightful story which would have been five stars without the unnecessary enhancements. Otherwise JR Moheringer is a very talented writer whom I will be looking forward to be reading more of soon."
3,Good read but uneven,"J.R. Moehringer is indeed a gifted writer and his coming to manhood tale has a certain appealing twist, in that he was truly raised by the village, this being the Publican community. The story bogs down at times when he resorts to filling pages with endless drinking escapades and I wonder how he remembers these times with such clarity. That said, the characters are interesting, though I wish they were more developed, and the overall story is worth the read."
3,"A Great Writer, but a boring story...","Although JR is an outstanding writer, I found myself wondering when would the story ever really go somewhere...this book just didn't do it for it me...I was overall very bored with it and only continued to read it because I thought for sure there was something I was missing?"
2,Through Rose Colored Beer Glasses.,"Where I was thoroughly enjoying the first half of this book by the end I found the author a whine of inaction. Yes, I get it - your name is JR - they are not your initials - your father left you - you have an identity crises. But do I need reminding every ten pages? Where the bar sequences are fun the book is ultimately about nothing. The author feels sorry for himself but doesn't act. After years of loving his time at the bar the writer has a sudden and not very well explained turn from his haven. Why?Also, all those years of heavy drinking with no consequence. Really. No consequence to any fellow customerS. Really?I'm also tired of writers and filmakers now using 9/11 as a self discovery tool. It is both cliched and insulting.The book committed the worst sin of a memoir - I stopped believing it."
3,Just kind of boring,"I am a memoir junky these days, and I have read many of them. While I will say that on a certain level, he is a talented writer, and did write much of this book with a sense of humor, it really lost steam half way through. I was bored. I'd just finished ""Molokai"", a historical novel, and had ""Gilead"" waiting for me after this one. Honestly, I just couldn't wait to be done so I could get going on the next book."
4,great read,The Tendar Bar is a quick read. It's offers an interesting perspective and reflection on boyhood. I enjoyed the read and was inspired by the main characters ability to overcome so many obstacles in his life. I would read it again!
3,Pushing back from the bar,"Perhaps the author skating around the issue of alchohol abuse and the impact on his life causes this memoir to have lack of focus. The exploration of his desire to have his father or his mythological father in his life intrigued me and kept me reading along with the responses of other family members. The life at the bar while in the beginning gave some insight became tedious. On the other hand, that life seemed to be his lifeline. Yet, it interfered with his growth and insight. His escape into drinking using the bar as an excuse and his relationships there stunted him and as a reader, I became stunted and bored at some level. I wanted him to move on. He does eventually but for the reader, it is a little late. Nonetheless, I would recommend the portions of the book where he is attempting to resolve the relationship with his father. You might say, having won the Pulitzer Prize that he found his way but he does not explore the other unresolved issues in his life."
4,Good read!,"I couldn't put it down. This coming of age story was intriguing and insightful - I believe it showed we all need a place that is a home away from home, whether it be a bar, club, friend's house etc. where we can get away from our life for a while. Sometimes, however, that place can be detrimental to our ability to make needed changes, to grow up. That the author was able to escape the environment holding him back is a testament to him, although it took events beyond his control to be able to do that."
4,It's interesting to read about bar comradery,"This book is entertaining, fun, and educational if you don't know anything about people who like to frequent bars. The book is about so much more than the bar, but it's about the role the bar and it's customer play in the main character's life. I also like how the writer devoted whole chapters to developing each main character."
5,The Tender Bar,"I LOVED this Book!! At one time I lived in a town that had at least 2 or 3 bars in each block. The noise at closing time, wether at 2:00 am or 4:00 am was very similar to the departure from Publicians."
2,Don't bother,I always think I will like this kind of book.....I very rarely do. This one didn't change my mind.
2,Can this be true? disappointing,"I kept waiting for some emotion, or trial, or addiction, or something remarkable to happen. This book is about a kid who spends lots of time in a bar with lots or people who drink too much and none of whom seem to have any problems. The kid has some difficulty in determining a direction, has some difficulty in getting good grades, has some difficulty with romance, and has many hangovers. I did not find anywhere in which the overindulgence in alcohol caused anything but minor damage and one is left with the perception that his somewhat difficult development years had little or no negative effect on his adulthood."
4,A Coming of Age Memoir,This is a lovely and moving story of a boy who grows up yearning for closeness with the father who has rejected him. It tells how the men in neighborhood bar offer the companionship and protection that help him grow up. This is a very good book
5,father so story,"Superior writing well worth a read. Many relationships looked at ...father son, mother son and more. I plan on reading more of this author."
4,The Tender Bar,Wonderfully written and an intriguing story which seems to be a quasi autobiography. Fascinating novel--a real winner of imagination and especially beautiful prose.
5,"A really honest, funny, often sad look into a boy finding his way to manhood","I loved this book and immediately bought Sutton, Moehringers first fictional work. The Tender Bar had some heart-wrenching moments when he was groing up fatherless, aching for a father-figure and finding it primarily within the tender yet dysfunctional group of guys at the bar his uncle works at. I found myself torn between trying to find a bar like Publicans and go there every day, to vowing to stop drinking altogether!"
5,Awesome. A Must Read.,"What a great book. I recommend it to anyone. From the epilogue(which makes you want to run out and have a few drink s at your favorite bar) to the story of his first ""time"" with a girl, to the end, it is wonderful! I've never read a book, especially non-fiction, that makes you feel every possible emotion throughout. Well done!"
4,A Great Memoir,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - I would hate to give away any of the fabulous story as so many other reviews have, but I will say that in a world full of autobiographies, this one stands out. Moments of entertainment, sadness, empathy, hilarity all shine in this novel and keep you reading along wishing if only it was longer."
5,Loved this book,"Didn"" t want it to end. Will read it again to savor the beautiful writing. Have recommended this book to everybody and give copies to several friends."
5,Tender to the ear!,"This book struck not only the right cord with me, but two right cords. I was a newspaper man for 16 years and have spent many happy evenings in a friendly neighborhood bar. Moehringer writes with honesty, love and brutality about this time in his life. I wanted to read it while drinking at the bar of Publicans. Have passed the book on to my son for many reasons, but the the line about how raising a good man is an art and raising a bad man is a tragedy, especially resonated."
4,Watching Someone you Care about Grow Up,"I enjoyed reading this book, especially when J.R. talks about the book he wanted to write, especially the chapter in which J.R. includes a number of anecdotes & jokes he meant to include in the book he imagined. I enjoyed the process aspect of this book--the process through which we see Moehringer realize his insecurities and identify his alcoholism, problems with women, and the role the bar plays in his life. It's a little bit like watching someone you care about grow up."
2,Not for me,"Likes and dislikes for books surely are determined in large part by personal tastes. This books just was not one I liked. Rarely do I give up on a book, particularly after I've invested in reading 50 or so pages, but I gave up on this one. I found it boring."
5,best work of non-fiction that I have read in a long time,"What an excellent book! The story was brutally honest and completely compelling throughout. There is no doubt, something in this book that everyone can relate to."
5,Raises the Bar,"This is one of the best memoirs I have read recently. It was both funny and heartfelt. It was as good as Mary Karr's ""Liars Club."" I recommend it."
1,Whining Wino,"Greatly looked forward to this one as i'm a big fan (the only one left?) of the confessional memoir and (literally) bought into the hype on ""The Tender Bar"". After finishing it yesterday i wanted nothing so much as to pop this whiny, self-indulgent mama's boy right in the kisser. ironic to think that the author's alleged tavern upbringing could produce such a self-indulgent, solipsistic bore. Apparently the only thing this baby took from the bar was a cliched alcohol addiction-jeez, where have we heard this before...or should I say where haven't we heard this before?? i never once felt sorry or empathetic for this guy and the so-called hurdles he's overcome just come across here as narcissistic twaddle. He earns a star, tho, only because i do think he's a talented wordsmith."
3,Not for children,"My 11 year old daughter wanted to read this book because it was for sale at her elementary school. I checked it out at the library and skimmed through it to see if it was fitting for a child in elementary school. Right away I opened it to material that was not fit for children -- sexual content. So this is just a warning for parents who want to know. I didn't read the book, but did read excerpts out of it. It may be wonderful for adults though according to the other reviews."
2,Wanted to like it--didn't.,"The sentences were so well crafted, if only they'd come together to reveal a story worth the read. By the middle of the book, the author's self-loathing whining had me wishing I could just stop reading it. Alas, I work in a retirement community and had to finish the book--it's this month's book club book. I really tried to like the book, but it was hard for me to get through the endless (and disjointed) nights at the bar. And the author's inability to stand up and be an adult was tiresome in the end. I think the sequel to this would be a much more interesting (and much less whiny) read. I lost interest midway through and skimmed the rest so that I could lead the meeting."
2,Suprisingly Disappointing,"I write this negative review reluctantly, as I was so looking forward to this book. The blurbs, the reviews, the idea of it, seemed so timely, so great, foolproof really and right up my alley. But...The writing -- on a sentence-level, was so poorly executed I could barely get through 50 pages. I understand Mr. Moehringer is a Pulitzer winner, and I'm sure in the realm of journalism he is on top of his game. And perhaps my standards are way too high and unreasonable reading mostly fiction as I do, but I do expect the craft of storytelling to be employed in some artful way, whether ""memoir"" or not. Simple reportage, as this reads, in the long form, seems unacceptable and incapable of holding my interest at least.I'll stop since I don't want to get snippy. But I had to comment on a glaring aspect of this book that most reviews seem unwilling to discuss."
1,Washed away by too many through the day,"This guy is a skillful writer though in a way I found depressing. He tells the tale of his broken and dysfunctional family to where you think your heart will break. He then proceeds to glom onto this bar scene where all the patrons are of a sub-Runyonesqe quality. In my view, a bar is usually filled with many troubled and addled people and this one is no exception. J.R M. trades his requisite alcoholic haze for access to the easy male camraderie of his new found friends. Unfortunately, the galloping neurosis of the typical patron provides a dark backdrop to what appears to be a festive scene. The part that sucked me in was his love relationship with his girlfiend Sidney. I wanted him to ""get the girl"", but his drinking and lack of ambition did him in. It was sad. He's a clever woodsmith and turner of phrases which makes his book worth reading. The man has talent."
5,A great read - beautifully writtten,"J.R Moehringer has a gift for writing, and he shared that gift in his personal memoir. The book just flows, and once into it, you will get great joy from reading it. He had quite an interesting life and does a great job of expressing his experiences on paper. Read it and enjoy it."
4,ER:Code Blue is a great addition to Emergency Room series,"When I bought this game, I expected minor emergency situations in the game. What I found was very realistic patient vitals and diagnostic info in every type of emergency. The type of emergencies range from minor sore throats to gun shot chest wounds. Having played past games in the Emergancy Room series, I enjoy the addtition of a timer, which requires you to think on your feet. If you're not quick on a critical case, your patient dies. This adds more realism to the game. The only downfall to this game is its lack of cases and poor graphics (same cut and paste bloood and injuries as the other ER series games). If you like the other Emergency Room games you're sure to love this one, because of its enhanced realism."
4,Not for ME,"This is not an ME version. It will play on my computer, but the sound is garbled. It also sometimes causes windows to crash when I turn it off. The game is engaging. Hint- fill out your report before you finish with the patient or else you get yelled at during the review. This is the first type of er game that I have played, and I recommend it. The first few patients may get testy while you fumble through the instruments. It is thought provoking game, so only get it you are patient. Good luck."
2,"good concept, bad game","i got this game because i am a pre-med student very interested in emergency care. unfortunately, this game did not live up to my expectations. instead of learning how to use certain tools, you are just expected to know what to do. if you use the beginner mode, it tells you exactly what to do, but it doesnt tell you why. this game needs a tutorial to teach what the tools in the tray are (how are you supposed to automatically know that clicking the magnifying glass means visually examining the patient?) and how to use them. also, points were taken off for stupid things, like asking questions (which is never a bad thing in real life) and doing the correct steps in what was supposed to be the wrong order. the paperwork section confused me as well. this could be a very good game if a few features were added, but overall it did not live up to expectations."
2,Give Me The Clash and the Sex Pistols,"I listened to Los Angeles/Wild Gift recently; I had heard a lot of praise for the cd. After I listened to the record, I tried to figure out exactly what part they were praising. Los Angeles is definitely the better album, but it still came off as disjointed, screaming, bash your brains in sludge. Sometimes that's okay, if the artists are talented. This sounded like every other punk band. London Calling, The Clash, and Never Mind The Bollocks are true blue punk cds, brilliant but still full of aggression and energy. Go pick them up."
5,A helpful text,This is a well-written and accessible text for an introductory survey of hymnology in Protestant churches. The authors have stellar credentials and a passion for the subject that is refreshing.
3,Required reading,This book was a requirement for a course I am taking at Seminary. It was interesting if you are interested in the history of hymns
2,generic film,"this film is aight. it had some laughs. I was up late over the weekend just Moting with the channels&I needed to laugh before I went to sleep so i flipped this film on&got a few laughs.it was very predictable,but it had some cool moments. that Crib was tight. the Chicks were banging&there was some funny moments,but on a whole it was very generic&just kinda there."
4,Nice Prints But.....,"I just bought the CP-200 to go with my S50 camera. Setting it up was very easy when it came to the camera and printer working together, haven't yet tried it with my computer.Because I do TRUE Dye Sublimation, I thought this printer was also going to allow me to do transfers, not so.I'm a tad bit disappointed that you have to buy SPECIAL paper for this printer. No where does it tell you this.This will mean that you will always have to carry a lot of extra stuff with you if you want to be able to print while on the road etc.I haven't decided if I'm going to keep this printer or buy the HP ink jet printer.The one good thing is with this printer your pics will last a lot longer then a ink jet."
1,CP 200 Printer Gypo,"This is one of the worst pieces of junk I have ever purchased. I've had it a few years and it never has worked right. The paper feeder carriage never quite fit in to the main printer and if you don't have it just right, it stops printing. Don't, I repeat DO NOT even consider this POS. Buy something else!"
3,Too Good to Be True in Florida!!,"I purchased the CP-200 card printer to go along with my canon A70 camera. While I thought the print quality was EXCELLENT, I was VERY disappointed in the fact that it didn't print TRUE 4X6 PRINTS!! What showed in the view screen on my camera NEVER printed on the photo paper. The printer cut off quite a bit of my pictures around the edges even-though the camera screen showed a box around which the printer would print. What's the point of having a printer that doesn't print all of the photo? For the amount of money that it costs for ink, special paper, etc. I found it MUCH CHEAPER to pay 29 cents a picture to have the pictures printed off of my photo card at the local drugstore. Great idea but yes, TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!"
3,Great for direct printing from camera only,"Bought this thing before Christmas. Works great with my Canon S45 when direct printing. Tried to get it to work with my computer.....no luck. After 3 months and trying to get Canon tech. support to help (they actually contradicted instructions in the software documents on how to set this thing up), I have given up and will only use it for printing straight from the camera. What a shame.I think another reviewer had a similar problem."
4,It can be fast.,"I used this printer with my Digital Rebel. It fed the paper almost immediately and started the printing process. Photos were done quickly. I find it valuable when visiting friends and family. I am able to leave photographic memories immediately. As for the price of photos, I don't print every photo that I take, only ones that I can't wait to print before I get home on my computer. This is definitely a nice little tool that can even be put in your camera bag. Don't expect to find cheaper replacement ribbons on the third party printer cartridge sites."
3,Doesn't adapt so well,"Delta usually puts more quality into thier products. I had a bit of trouble trying to get the screw holes on the dust adapter to align with those of the jointer. Once attached, the fit was less that tight, which caused some shavings and dust to leak out when used with my shop-vac. When I hooked it up to my Jet 1100CF vac, these problems seemed to go away."
4,works great once installed,"Installation wasn't easy as the two upper bolt holes were way off. I also tried installing it upside down, but had the same problem. Since it is made of sheet metal I used a rattail file to elongate the holes. Eventually it installed. I also used weather stripping along the sides connecting to the tabs. Hooked it to a shop vacuum and it works great. No loose dust at all."
5,Works great!,"Easy to install, works great with my dust collection system. It only extends below the jointer if you install it upside down!"
3,"works, but keeps jointer from sitting flat","The dust adapter works as described. They fail to mention, however, that it extends below tabletop level somewhat, so the jointer must be placed at the edge of the bench so the adapter can hang over. This also makes it hard to store the jointer on a shelf, or the floor. What were they thinking?"
4,Easy to install.,"It took about three minutes to pull off two torx screws, two phillips screws, hold the adapter in place, and put the four screws back in. I then folded the wings on the sides with a rubber mallet and this seems to have sealed it well. My only gripe is that it should have something akin to weather stripping to seal it though it's adequate as delivered."
5,CD purchase,"excellent serviceMonteverdi - L'Orfeo / Rolfe Johnson, Dawson, von Otter, Argenta, M. Nichols, Tomlinson, Chance, Baird; Gardiner"
1,Waste of Money,"I would not reccomend this video to anyone. The scoring moves shown on the tape don't show the setup that got the scoring move so the tape misses the mark for anyone who wrestles. Moreover, the video is probably not exciting enough to interest the non wrestler. A well produced video WILL sell in good quantities if the networks would just take the time to market their products better and consult with wrestlers. It would also be good to have athlete interviews etc. I was very disapointed!"
1,Less than an hour long!,"I was very disapointed with this video. They were definately not marketing the video to amatuer wrestling fans. It is frustratingly short. The video starts off with a refrigerator commercial. The entire video (including the commercials), is 57 minutes long. 16 weight classes covered in under an hour.The coverage is very fast and very heavily edited. Several wrestlers on the U.S. team were never mentioned. Most matches are picked up in the last minute or so. Very similar to the actual (very limited) wrestling coverage by NBC.The video does include the awesome throw by Garrett Lowney and the Gardner/Karelin bout.I would have gladly paid $50 to $100 for more comprehensive coverage. Given what is offered here, the video is barely worth the money. A video this short should have been $4.99."
3,Devil Inside,"The game is old, but interesting to play. If you have a newer computer, though you'll probably need to finagle a bit to get it to run. Still, worth the price."
2,NOT FOR THE REAL HORROR FANS,"i must tell u when i bought this game in hongkong i was very excited about the theme and what i got was a game that really had not much of a scare or the spooks,the game has a good theme as u play as dave ""an investigator"" who plays for the show ""THE DEIL INSIDE"",his mission is to enter the shadow gate manor with a cameraman who captures his every move live.i feel this game is in no way scary cause u are never really alone,u have ur cameraman with u and audience who are seeing ur every move.the graphics are good but the atmosphere of a horror game is just not there.the controls too are average.the game does have a few moments to make u feel alone but then again are u."
1,A disaster,"The book is a nightmare. The average length of each sentence is six words or thereabouts. I think Disney's speech bubbles are more complex than this. It reminds me of a bad TV preacher with dimples and I felt like exclaiming ""halleluja"" after each sentence. The man is completely incapable of putting a readable paragraph together. I read this book after devouring Charles Taylor's Modern Social Imaginaries and I did not manage to get past page 30, no matter how hard I tried. Horrible."
5,Thanks for writing it !,"During the past five years I have read a couple of books on Leadership, from Stephen Covey, Tony Robbins, Tom Peters, Brian Tracy and others, but your book is absolutely the best one I have read. Your ideas are very clear so when reading your book it was like I was reading my own mind, but now with the right words. (In English) I bought your book ""Leadership from Within"" on my way back home from Hawaii. Thanks for writing it !Bjarni Ingibergsson Reykjavik, Iceland"
5,SWEEEEEEEEEEET,"Oni is the sort of game that I wanted to be playing when Tomb Raider came out. Oni is a perfect blend of 3rd person action and strategy, with story lines that actually give the game some depth. Konoko is the sort of main character that could knock Lara Croft off her pedestal in an instant!"
3,No online support :(,"This was a wonderful game. Beautiful graphics, fun gameplay, etc. But there was no online support which really bothered me. I was counting on playing this game online. GOD games response to this was that they couldn't add online support because ping times would be too high, it would only work on LAN. If you don't mind the lack of online capability, then you should definitely buy this game because single player mode is awesome."
4,towel rack,Definitely meets expectations. Instructions Say needs to 2 people to assemble but I did it on my own without bothering the husband. Husband likes it too.
5,Amazing Insight,As I live in Australia I found it hard to get this book. After seeing a write up on it in my local paper I found the different cultures amazing to see in their homes and their worldly possessions. Must buy this book.
5,Buy this book!,"You will not regret buying this book, I promise. It is excellent. You will see raw facts about life around the world. It is honest and open and hugely informative."
5,A Beautiful and Important Work,"The photographs that are highlighted in ""Material World"" reveal people and their possessions, people from many countries, rich and poor. To see how many others in the world live gives us only a glimpse of our good fortune here in the U.S. A valuable and timely book."
1,What Blather!!,"This book is an attempt to shame Americans for living in the land of plenty. So what we have more stuff than other folks do! Most of the world is hobbled by war and bad government so people have less wealth than Americans. But I'm not losing any sleep over it. The Sierra Club is a political organization and this book is just that. . . politics. Read the part about American family ... ""the legacy of slavery"" and the ""uneven distribution of wealth"". What pure hooey!"
1,+-NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"I AM TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK! I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEVERLY PRESENTED. WHY AREN'T THINGS JUST STACKED UP ON ONE ANOTHER IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PLANE? FROM THE COVER, IT LOOKS LIKE THE PERSPECTIVE IS ALWAYS FROM THE TOP. WHAT THE HECK? ARE WE JUST LOOKING DOWN ON THESE PEOPLE? AND WHY ARE THE CAUCASIANS ON TOP AND SHOT AT NIGHT, WHEN THE PERUVIANS ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND SHOT DURING THE DAY?"
4,Good regal sound and quality,"Good used cd purchase for me. Boyce has a majestic royal sound to these works. One may confuse him for any number of talented and qualified composers of the time.For those who like woodwinds and a touch of brass with your Baroque, I would suggest this. There is much livliness and dash in these works creating uplifting and sparkling joy!Trevor Pinnock does a good job introducing individulas to Boyce through his professional and masterful conducting.I'm sure you will also be pleased with this selection.Good Day Friends !"
5,Beautiful Music,"This instrumental CD is absolutely beautiful. It is soothing music for the human soul, and our four legged family members just happen to love it too!Every single song is wonderful and relaxing. This CD blows away the highly recommended CD set ""Pet Music"".Don't be deterred by the ""talk"", it is nothing more than momentary introductions which set the stage for a few songs; and the voices are as hypnotic as the music that quickly follows.I have read that some vets play this CD in their offices to help calm animals with remarkable results. I believe if human doctors played ""Music Pets Love"" in their offices we humans would benefit from it's relaxing songs just as well.This is one of those very rare CDs that every single song is simply beautiful and I play beginning to end. In my home, it is a toss up to which species responds most positively to this CD ....a toss up between dogs and humans. You cannot go wrong with this CD. Enjoy!"
1,I wouldn't recommend.,"This CD actually caused more anxiety in my dog then him being left alone. The 1st track starts with sounds of children on a playground. Needless to say, he was looking all over the house for the people that he could hear talking. I'm glad I stayed at home with him to play it for the first time, since he was running around barking (and my dog NEVER barks!) I had to turn it off halfway through track 2. Waste of money!"
5,Wonderful,Pets need some relaxing sounds too. This disc is great to show your pets how much you love them.
5,Totally relaxing for pets and people alike,"I too have all of Bradley Joseph's albums, and this is right up there among my favorites. He's done a wonderful job re-arranging some of his classic tunes for this CD. I have to get another one as I've given them away to the vet, local Humane Society shelter, and groomer, not to mention my whole family got one for Christams last year and they were completely impressed too. Its a great gift item for any pet lover."
1,certainly not appropriate for dogs,"I think the designers of this CD need to know the difference between a pet and human children. While some pet lovers call their pets their ""children"" the reality is, they are not. This CD might work very well for a baby or young child. For a dog?? Not so much. What's with all the talking on the CD?? And the distracting noise of kids playing??A CD of Mozart's Violin Sonatas has been significantly more productive at keeping my little pack happy and less destructive on my return home. And something I enjoy as well. I found this CD to be more annoying than restful."
3,This CD was OK.,I believe this CD was created for humans and not for dogs. I did not see any reaction in my dogs at all. I don't think it even phased them. I have found that other cds have worked better.
4,Really worth the investment,"I have 2 Miniature Schnauzers, one which is just a little over a year old the other just turn 8 years old and I am home bound; therefore I very seldom leave the home; therefore, when I go away they have anxiety attacks and one will plays off the other, such as taking a stuff toy and play tug of war. That was always an unusual personality of both of my Miniature Schnauzers since they have been well trained. So I realized being an owner now of 5 Miniature Schnauzers over the years and very much into obedience, ""while I was gone"" their behavior was quite mischievous until I bought 3 of the CDs: Done Gone Classical and 2 of the While I was Gone. What a difference it made in the change of their comfort. I just set the CD player at shuffle and repeat. So they realized that I had to come home to turn off the CD player.JDSnook"
5,5 Stars for Bad Girl alone,"Great all-American rock rom Texas in the sixties. Most everything on this album is pretty close to great, but ""Bad Girl"" is SO great that I'd spend fifteen bucks on a single. This is the epitome of punk rock. This is music directly from the brains of these kids (the singer was only 15 years old!) to your ears, unfiltered and undiluted by image or anyone else's standards. This album contains everything they ever recorded, and you should own it."
3,"Momma,Please forgive me","I felt the book was good, The subject of domestic abuse is much needed, All too many women and children go through this today.It was touching but the characters were lacking.I do salute her for doing this, and for leaving all the information for families to get help in the back of the book. Toi is an author who cares about today's issues and i hope she continues in this line of writing."
5,Heavily Awesome,"Only Crime's 'Virulence' is a great CD to pick up - it's easy to listen to when you want to concentrate, when you want to relax, or when you just want to drive around and lose yourself. It's a freight-train of songs, impacting the auditory senses and flooding the body with a gamut of emotions. 'Virulence' is good for those sunny days, those rainy days, and those days when there is no weather at all. ""Just Us"" (Track 7) is up there as one of my favorite songs of all time, but the album, as whole, stands strong. And even if you never got into hardcore-punk music, this one will certainly catch your attention as it captures and conveys the truest of human sentiments."
3,Its okay!!!,"Havent used it too much yet, but i do like when my hair stylist use it when she rolls my hair. The product came open wasnt happy about that and it leaked a little i dont know if it was like that or the post man when he put it in my mailbox."
3,smells amazing but not the best for acne-prone skin,"i like to use the serum while my hair is damp before it is completely dry after showering.the only reason i purchased this product was so that my boyfriend could notice a lovely new fragrance in my hair (which he has, and loved it). however, i think the scent should be stronger (i had to use 3 pumps in order for him to finally notice!).if i leave it on overnight, my hair gets really oily the next day which is not a good thing for my acne-prone skin. this is a great product if you shower everyday because it keeps frizzy hair and flyaways noticably calm and under control. i have definitely seen a difference with my hair."
1,Did not fixed problem,Was sent to incorrect address not there fault. Did offer to correct problem nor did I get credit.Never got my item
4,"Great product, I highly recommend it to everyone",I use this everytime I wash my hair. It cuts drying time and makes my hair sooo silky. I highly recommend it.
2,I don't see any difference.,"I have used it but don't see any difference this product causes.I applied it on my curly hair after shampoo. But once the hair is dry, it's just the same."
3,Ho-hum...,"This is the most money I've ever used on a hair product, and I wasn't impressed. Didn't control my frizzy fly-aways like I thought it would. Also, my skin is just a TAD on the sensitive side, and I noticed after using it for about a week, that anywhere my hair touched, I broke out."
4,Not for me,"This looks to me like it works for a lot of people, but not me. It doesn't really help my hair much. My hair still stays frizzy. But it does make it feel smoother and hair smell better. I love the smell. But other than those two things it doesn't do anything else to my hair."
5,An absolute necessity for thick hair,"I came across this stuff about 8 years ago when I was talked into buying it at a salon.I am SO glad that I did.It softens and smooths my thick hair into complete compliance. I can straighten it or curl it and it always looks great. The (very) few times that I've had to shower without Skinny Serum available since then, my hair has been a total mess.One caveat: less is more. Use too much and your hair will look greasy. I use one small pump for long, thick, wavy hair. Usually I go through 1 bottle every 1-2 years.All in all, if you're on the fence, try it out!"
3,CLINICA COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY FOR TECHNOLOGIST,"iT IS A GREAT BOOK, BUT IT DOES NOT COVER THE UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITIES, OTHERWISE IT WILL BE RATED 4 STARS"
3,I am grateful for such a resourse,Wish it had the 4 spiritual laws in the beginning of the book. I love how well it references scripture.
4,WW II propaganda,"So So video transfer. Interesting take on the eve of WW II. Axis not named but guess who the villains are. I'd look for a better video transfer if you're a Hitchcock fan, try Criterion."
5,Factory-Reconditioned Bosch 13618-2G-RT 18-Volt Ni-Cad 1/2-inch Cordless Hammer Drill/Driver,"Bosch makes a rugged tool, have dropped the drill from top of a 10' ladder and no problem. The extra torque is a plus and the 1/2"" chuck with hammer drill feature makes this a dependable drill. The price for the reconditioned tool helps the initial 'sting' as compared to cost of a new tool. Batteries are pricy, but are good for 2 years and considering purchasing the reconditioned tool that includes a charger and 2 batteries makes it economical."
5,AMAZON Scores Again,"The DVD was bought for my step-granddaughter, who loves Will Smith anything! That having been said, as always, the performance of Amazon and its ""work-withs"" has been excellent. Better than I would ask or hope for! That's all I can say, and I have said it from the first time I ordered from AMAZON.COM."
2,Not one of Channing's best,"I rented this movie because I'm a big Stockard Channing fan, but was very disappointed. The movie, though it has an amusing plot, is very disjointed and often leaves the viewer questioning how it moved to the next part of the plot. This isn't meant to be a very informational review, just a caution that you may not want to spend time on this one, much less money."
4,A sad story,"As Ouisa Kittredge points out, Paul (Will Smith) infiltrates their lives with no other intention than to feel he had a respectible identity and to get a glimpse into their lives; indeed, he even stabs himself for it! And they, eager to have access to Paul's supposed father, Sidney Portier, are all too willing to welcome him.The message I think this movie conveys that that societal standing does not guarantee happiness: Paul has none, and the Kittredges have a lot, and they are both equally empty. Neither group is content with their current reality, and both opt for an illusion instead. As Ouisa points out, Paul shows them more appreciation in one evening than their children had in an entire lifetime."
1,awful,"Just plain awful, I can't believe anyone would think this movie is entertaining at all, what a waste of time!"
1,Was so boring I couldn't watch the whole thing,"Does this movie ever get to a ""point""? If it does, it takes way too long. I stopped watching after about 45 minutes because I felt I was wasting my time."
2,Some of it just doesn't fit!,"This movie has SOME brilliant plot elements in it, but others feel like they are crammed in with a shoe horn. Overall, I was left disappointed and therefore won't waste any more of my time or yours."
5,Great departure from Wills norm.,Great casting. Don't usually care for Stockard Channing - but this is an exception. Wonderful story - loved all the twists and extentions of the intruders affect.
1,Six Degrees,I only watched the first half hour and then my husband had had enough. It seemed all they did was sit around and talk. Maybe if I had been able to watch more of it it would have gotten better.
3,Expected more from it.,"The movie was entertaining, but nothing memorable. I wanted to understand more about Will Smith's character and why he was the way he was."
2,Disappointed,Very disappointed - with the cast we thought it would be a good movie. We were wrong. Wouldn't recommend this
4,Made me stop and think,"I happen to see this movie late at night. I was spellbound by the dialogue even though there where numerous 3 minutes commercials throughout the entire show. Most good movies I see lack any meaningful droplets of thoughts and leave you with a adrenaline rush and soon forgotten except for remembering the costumes, the special effects, or the action scenes. This movie is all about dialogue that flows like sweet running water. I certainly did not enjoy the homosexual piece but it is a painting of the complete character that is a true con man. I wonder why this very intelligence con man never struck it rich. Truly his weakness was his destruction. In the end, I am going to rent and maybe later purchase this movie to get the full essence of the performance and the dialogue."
1,Awful Movie,This movie was so fragmented and odd I was just dumbfounded. Neither I or my husband could really engage in it and ended up turning it off after 30-45 minutes. It was going absolutely no where and was not funny except for us laughing at the ridiculousness of it. We read somewhere that it was based on a screen play and you can tell.
4,EXCELLENT,A great movie. I was pleased with Will Smith's early acting days. This movie was well writtend and well casted.A must see~A movie to add to your collection of oldies.
3,Mother Will,"Wow,I was so surprised to see the gay side of Will Smith. It was and out standing performance of one who put his mind body and inner sole into a gay character.I give the movie three snaps."
5,will smith's best role ever far&away,will smith did a wonderful job in this film.unlike the out of space smart mouth roles he usually gets.he truly acts in this film.all films after this one are fancy one-liners with very little substance.this film shows what he could do if he allows himself to be an actor first&foremost.a must see film.
1,horrible,"gross gay sex scene with Will Smith, did not need to see that.. it came out of nowhere. Awful.. gross. Shameful"
2,I didn't really enjoy it,"The whole point of Will Smith being a gay con artist just put me off. He's still a great actor, but I didn't like this role at all."
3,A Movie for the Chattering Classes.....,"After watching this movie for about 10 minutes, it was obvious this was first a Broadway play in Manhattan. The characters are chatterers who constantly, in their stream of consciousness manner, spout off their musings. Any momentary opportunity for a gap of silence is filled in with non-stop babble.To be fair, the movie is witty and intelligent in places. But for the most part, people don't converse in this way. The performances and the actors ( obviously ) are top notch. Just a bit unrealistic and not my cup of tea."
4,ONE OF THE BEST FOR WILL SMITH,THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST REALISTIC ROLES THAT WILL SMITH EVER PLAYED BEFORE HIS ROLE IN ENEMY OF THE STATE. PEOPLE ARE USED TO SEEING WILL IN THOSE ROLES WHERE HE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH CARE OF BEING SERIOUS. HIM TEAMING UP WITH ACTORS LIKE DONALD SUTHERLAND HAS DONE ALOT FOR HIS CAREER. SIX DEGREE OF SEPERATION SHOWS THAT HE CAN PLAY ANY ROLE HE PUT HIS MIND TO. WAY TO GO WILL..
4,Wonderful Addition to the Series.,"Great Characters, realistic plot, and interesting premise make this a wonderful addition to the series. Great Read"
4,Hilda Johansson finds the killer of a politician,"Hilda and her family have finally saved enough money to bring the rest of the family from Sweden. Her romance with Patrick, the Irish fireman are about the same as before, neither family approves. Patrick takes her to the local county fair, but is called away before he can join her on a balloon ascension. His Uncle Daniel, a candidate for local office is missing, and his opponent is found beaten to death with Daniel's shilleleagh next to him. Hilda is hired by his friends and family to find Daniel and to find out who really killed Mr. Bishop.This is a very unusual series. The story is told from the point of view of a maid in the famous Studebaker household. Usually, only the wealthy or educated are the main characters in mysteries. The author combines an accurate portrayal of immigrant life with a really good mystery. I look forward the the rest of the series."
1,"Good Dictionary, but bad CD.","I used to be a big fan of LAAD and bought two LAAD with CD. I have mostly used LAAD on the computer. I lost one CD. Now the other CD has a mysterious crack on it, which does not allow me to do the monthly authentication. I am sick and tired that LAAD needs an authentication every month, not even every six months or a year. I am now buying both the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate 11th Edition (with CD) and the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 4th edition (with CD) with almost the same amount of money for just one LAAD. And I am deleting LAAD from my computer, which does not work anyway without the pesky authentication."
1,Not Trustworthy Seller,"They sent me a book with no CD. Moreover, I send them back their book in hope they will refund my $1.52 extra mailing cost out of my pocket but they never did. This the first BAD SELLER in Amazon ever encountered in my over two years shopping experience. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
4,Works fine,This stone is fine for general tool and knife sharpening. Fits well in my hand and has 2 different grits for rough and smooth blades.
4,dual grit sharpener,"The dual grit sharpener works just fine, sharpened my hatchet the first day I got it so I know it works."
4,Great portible tool for hatchet/axe/survival knife sharpening.,"Very good tool for sharpening axes machetties and especially curved blades. As I work the woods, I can sit for a break and reclean the edge quickly and get back to hacking. Not great for super fine sharpening like pocket knifes or cutlery, but undeniably handy and simple to use while in the woods and on the go. :] Wish It came with a pouch."
2,"Sold as new, delivered as used!","Just delivered, although I haven't used it yet...that doesn't mean it hasn't been tested by someone else. Delivered with a couple of grooves and scratches on! If I wanted a used one, I would have ordered one! I appreciate I am going to beat the crap out of it myself sharpening an axe, but it is the principal! What's the phrase...caveat emptor!It is about the third time I have had this BS from an Amazon sale."
4,Use this for Large Knives and Tools/Hatchet ONLY,"Using this to obtain a razor blade is not possible. So keep your EDC knives and kitchen blades away from this. It's been effective at sharpening my hatchet only really. I tried it on a cheap pocket knife I had just to try to obtain a finer edge, but that just ended up wearing down metal with no improvement in sharpness."
3,Perfect size for handheld use..,awesome product that is well made coarse is perfect but the fine side could be a finer grit..It works well and is definitely worth the $$
2,no show,i ordered it with 2 machetes and never got to me and just deleted itself of my account that i ordered it but the worst part is the money for it was out of my bank :( i really wanted it too
1,Missing Instructions,"The sharpener came without instructions for use. The shipping packet states ""Instructions enclosed"", but there are no instructions inside. The inside of the cardboard is blank?I emailed Lansky customer service 8 days ago and have received no response.I regret my purchase."
1,Company must be asleep,"I purchased this in order to sharpen my new, unused shovel and some machetes. This instructions included do not inform you on how to use it other than making circular motions. It does not say at what angle to employ the device. The company website is even more deplorable. You try to buy ""American"", but it seems as most are 'asleep at the wheel'. I utterly regret this purchase."
4,"Fits nicely in my hand, lies flat on the table","The basic dual grit sharpening stone. Works well on carbon steel blades. I have used it for knifes, machetes, and axes."
5,Awesome for my machete,"I recently bought a machete that was thick in steel, but dull. I was able to sharpen the top half decently enough just using the back of an old knife, but the bottom half would stay dull. I used the puck for about ten minutes and the machete went through paper with practically no effort. It does a great job. I use the machete mainly for clearing tall/thick grass and trying out new fishing spots around my town."
4,Nothing Wrong Here,"This is obviously not designed to give a fine edge, it is meant to keep field tools sharp enough to use while working. I love it because it is compact and convenient, it fits in virtually any pocket and does its job efficiently. It is especially useful on long blades, because you move the puck, instead of running the entire blade along a traditional block. I use it on my longer machetes/swords and makes a great addition to my bug out bag. will come in handy dealing with maintenance on the go. i highly recommend if you aren't looking for a fine edge."
5,James with Soul!,"Classic music like this should still be played on commercial radio today. Sang with emotion, soul, and heart. If you liked ""At Last"" in the movie _Rain Man_, you will love every song on this album/CD. A must have for any Jazz and/or Blues music fan."
5,Is there more,"What can I say from gravel to heaven. Etta James' album 'At Last"" lives up to it's name. Every track is an exercise in ecstasy. 'As good as it gets'."
2,"alas, At Last","Good music but rather poor production quality. This should be remastered and re-released to allow Etta's music to shine as it should, can and does on her newer works."
4,Greatness,"I heard ""At Last"" on a Estee Lauder Commerical and fell in love with it. This is a must have for my CD collection.The entire CD is nice"
5,"The best of Etta's ""Best Ofs"" were some of her first albums","At Last! The digitally remastered release with bonus tracks is this one, so you don't need the Essential Etta James, this is it, and it is truly essential. I personally can't live without this album in regular rotation; it's a superb pick-me-up that just grabs your heart from the get-go and keeps you smiling and grooving all the way through. At last! showcases Etta's power as the hottest blues diva on the 60's circuit, and along with Etta James Rocks the House you've got two of the best CDs ever put out in blues and R&B . She'll rock your house till it rolls right over; these tunes have stood the test of time and should be on everyone's most played lists."
5,At Last,"Sets the standard for what she is known for, absolutely the best of all time. At Last reaching the recognition she sacrificed for."
5,"Great, Wonderful, Fantastic!!!","This CD was given to me as a gift because I mentioned it in passing(isn't that sweet!!). Anyway, the only song I knew was At Last, now I've found other songs by Ms. James that I find just as great if not better. A good investment!!!"
5,a classic,"What a voice. A great collection of songs by Etta James in her prime. Put this on and an instant mood is evoked. ""At Last"" was our wedding song."
2,Etta James,I have 2 other Etta James cds and I love them. This cd left me cold...very 'pop' very little blues. I didn't like it at all...verydisappointed!
5,the very best indeed,"This here is another collection of Marvin Gaye's work coming from the Motown vaults. As we all know, Marvin has many classics under his belt and he serenades the listeners while working his groove. The history speaks for itself. And if that isn't enough for the average person, or someone that has all of Marvin's albums and does not want to buy another greatest hits collection, there is an unreleased track included that is entitled ""Where are we going?"". Once again, it shows him pouring more emotion than the average singer out these days. So in conclusion, I say this should be another addition to your Marvin Gaye collection. As the title of his 1995 box set states, he is ""The Master"" indeed. Rest in Peace MPG. We'll remember you>"
3,At LAST--Etta James,I purchased this item for the hit song ' At Last'. It's a song i like to listen to over and over.
3,Shipping Issue,"I'd ordered several of these CDs, which were put into one bubble envelope, but not individually wrapped -- consequently, they arrived with three of the jewel cases cracked."
4,Very Powerful,This is a great blender that is well worth the money. It's very durable and has a lot of power. I am sure we'll be using it for many years. I only wish there was an option for a glass top.
1,stay away from this blender,"i have to admit, the endorsement of cook's illustrated was all it took for me to shell out far more than they are asking now for this blender a year and a half ago. and it really knocked my socks off. well this weekend i filled is will some tofu and peanut butter and other fun stuff for making cookies, and it couldn't blend it. so i took everything out, and when i turned it back on the button lights are all randomly blinking. the crazy thing is, it didn't stop on me or even sound like it was struggling. called kitchen aid they told me i over loaded it, and that it was dead and i am over a year out so no warranty. this blender is far to expensive to just crap out, and that's what it did. she offered refurbished models on their website...no thank you. i already have a broken blender."
1,Cracked after a year of light use,I've had this blender for about a year. The blender pitcher has developed two cracks in the bottom that cause leakage whenever it's used. And they have the nerve to ask $50 for a replacement?Don't buy this blender!
2,Blender motor great; pitcher is defective,"With very little use over several years (about 10x a year), the rubber gasket in the pitcher failed. It starts leaking slowly -- you think initially it's just a little overspill from the pitcher -- and then eventually crumbles and the thing is like a sieve as liquid dribbles out the bottom. I called Kitchenaid but it's warrantied for a year, they said, and it was past that. I asked about a recall, or a replacement given the very high rate of failure of this design. The service rep suggested I buy a replacement pitcher for thirty percent more than Amazon charges here for the pitcher and/or a new blender. They obviously get a lot of calls on this product but bravely, and perhaps expectedly, stick to their phone script. As another reviewer noted, either buy another blender (my recommendation) or be Zen about the defect here, stifle any irritation with Kitchenaid's corporate stonewalling, and be okay with buying a new pitcher on a regular basis."
1,Terrible Leakage,"I got this blender as a wedding gift. It worked great for the first couple months. However, after about 5 months it started leaking. Slowly but surely the leak got worse and worse. The blade on the bottom is loose so when I make smoothies, they just pour right out of the bottom. I'm very disappointed in this- especially since it was supposed to be a really nice blender."
5,Monster ice crusher,"If you're into crushed ice and smoothie type drinks, this is easily the best one I've found. It reduces ice cubes to a smooth slush in just seconds. The ""crush ice"" mode pulses on and off to crush the ice quickly and few more seconds at a higher speed smooths it out and adds some air volume. It also looks very sleek, so won't mind leaving it out on your bar or in the kitchen."
4,Customer Service plus price equals value,"We are now on our second KitchenAid brushed chrome blender. The first one quit. I suspect I worked it too hard, making my own peanut butter. Until it quit it was perfect. When I called for service on this 8-month old blender, KitchenAid had a very nice American service rep who mailed me a new blender at their expense, with a box to return mine, at their expense.I have never experienced customer service of this quality, ever. It's KitchenAid appliances for me from now on. As for the peanut butter project, I think I was asking too much of a blender in this price range, so I'll quit. If you want really heavy-duty blending, probably the astronomically-priced VitaMix is your baby. I'll stick with KitchenAid for all my appliances. The appliances are good, but the service quality I received was fantastic. I sure hope they don't try to figure out a way to cut costs in that department!!"
5,This blender rocks!,"I had the old Kitchenaid blender and it was okay but I did not like taking it a part to clean. Also the rubber thing at the bottom that caused the blades to turn wore down until they finally broke off.I just got this blender today and it rocks! I made a super thick smoothie and it blended right up without any need for me to stir during the blending. The cleanup is also super easy since no disassembly required.Finally, the brushed nickel finish looks fantastic with my stainless steel appliances."
1,Works great for a while then LEAKS horrible,"Like many others, we're experiencing terrible leaks from the jar when using this blender. We primarily use it to make smoothies with frozen fruit. The blender does an excellent job of making smoothies, but after about 8 months of use, we began to notice that there were drops of smoothie UNDER the bottom of the jar after use. This has steadily grown into a STREAM of smoothie pouring out of the bottom of the jar, all over the blender and onto the counter every time we use it. We've tried to tighten the hex nut that is on the bottom of the jar and it works to stop the leak for maybe one use and then, poof, the leak is back, worse than ever.Avoid this blender at all costs unless you relish the idea of wiping down your blender and counters every time you use it. Terrible design."
5,Works Great,"We have used the blender a lot since we got it.It is easy to use and easy to clean after using.It has the right amount of settings to get yourjobs completed.We could not wait to use the new blender,and we dropped off the old blender at the GoodWill."
2,comes off the track,"Each time I use this blender it works for a few seconds then becomes unhooked or off track from the grooves in the base. You have to take the jar off the base and reattach, often several times to get it working again. It will work again for a bit then go off track again. I can't seem to get it to run correctly for more than 25 seconds. I have become so frustrated I just purchased a new blender from Amazon."
5,Perfect for kitchen,We purchased this blender this year and I will have to admit that it surpassed our expectations. We use it daily to make healthy smoothies with ice. The ice gets crushed easily in no time even at low speeds.
5,the best blender ++++++,"This blender was reviewed by Cook's magazine and found to be the best in all categories. It is quiet, crushes ice and makes smoothies so well. I had a blender that worked just fine, except smoothies were a pain because the unblended parts would stay at the top and I kept having to stir. This blender makes me happy each time I use it. I can't say enough good things about it. Worth the price!"
5,Nice Blender,We purchased this blender to replace an old inexpensive blender that finally burned out. This unit does a nice job with frozen drinks which is what we mainly use it for. The chop ice feature makes short work of creating nice smooth drinks. I finish the drinks with a few seconds of high speed. The jug pours with less dripping than the unit it replaced. The blender is very easy to clean which is a big improvement over it's predecessor as well. I cannot talk to longevity yet but the blender has plenty of power and does not seem to struggle at all so I expect it will last. I would buy this unit again.
5,Definitely worth it,I love this blender. We use it at least 3 times a week to make strawberry smoothies. I've never had a problem with it and its a cinch to clean. Great product.
1,Leaks uncontrollably - see photos in this review,"I got this blender from my husband for Xmas 2010. After a few months of use, the pitcher began to leak slightly... nothing big, but it did require cleaning *under* the pitcher after use. However, after several more months of use with minor leaks, the pitcher began to leak uncontrollably. Literally pouring my smoothie out of the bottom of the pitcher where it would accumulate. After picking up the pitcher, the smoothie would spill/pour down over the top of the blender. It takes upwards of 10 min to clean the blender base and the counter. The blender base is starting to smell bc the smoothies have leaked into the mechanism itself and are no doubt rotting inside. Disgusting!See my pictures in this review for more graphic detail.To KitchenAid's credit, I called and they are sending a free replacement pitcher, even though I'm out of warranty. We'll see if it works any better...."
2,Lasted less than a year,"After reading the great reviews, we registered for this blender. It was a great step up from the cheap $30 blender I had in college that smelled like burning plastic every time you used it, but it has been just under a year and our blender is already broken. The blender still runs but is jerky and now it too smells like burning. We did not have any of the problems with the jar that other people have mentioned. We always wash the jar and the lid in the dishwasher and it is holding up just fine even on Hot Wash and Heated Dry settings."
2,Good while it lasts,"I loved this blender for about the first year. It IS high speed. BUT the reason I bought a Kitchen Aid is because I wanted it to last a lifetime. This surely is not the blender I thought it was. Right after the manufacturer's 1 year warranty, the bowl started leaking, and leaking and leaking. We tried tightening the bolt but it just kept getting worse. The company did replace the bowl (as a one-time courtesy). But it looks like I will only have about another year left on it before the bowl goes out again. I wish I would have known about the Vita-Mix before I purchased this one."
1,Don't buy this blender!,We purchased this blender to make smoothies almost every morning. It worked well for 9-10 months and then it began to leak. It leaks to the point that liquid is pouring out of the bottom before you even turn it on. Then if you turn it on you have a huge mess on your hands. Do not purchase this blender! I am in search of a new one:(
4,I really like this blender,"I really like this blender. I have had it over 5 months. I make a protein smoothie with frozen fruit (no ice) every day. My previous blender took about 90 seconds to blend my smoothie, and there were still chunks of frozen fruit that never got chopped no matter how long it blended. With this blender, my smoothie is ready in under 30 seconds. This saves me a minute a day, or 6 hours a year, or a full day every 4 years. And what can be better than more free time !!! I will also add that I hand wash the blender jar, and it has not shown any sign of leaking. I waited 2 months for it to be shipped to me, but the price was under $100, so very worth it. The base is very heavy, and easy to clean. It also looks very nice on the counter."
1,Burned two of them just making pesto sauce,"I burned through TWO of those, brand new, by just making a simple pesto sauce.This includes only wallnuts, pinenuts, butter, olive oil, garlick and basil leaves.The power of this machine must be insufficient, or whatever the defect is, but itjust has a hard time spinning a full jar of the above ingredients without burning.Once it burns, it's useless. I kept going for the same model, thinking it was myuse that got it burned, but now I see it's the construction deficiency."
2,Our Blender Leaks,Our blender has started to leak. Is is something we are doing wrong or is this a defect?
2,Leaks!,"I bought this blender at the beginning of the year, but only started using it this month. I was making two smoothies a day, some with ice, some without, and within two weeks, the base started leaking. FOr the amount of money I spent, leaking is not acceptable."
3,"Great, but had issues","I wanted to give this blender 5 stars. It is easy to use and clean. I love the ice-crush feature! BUT, after using it for less than 2-weeks, i made my morning smoothie, and it left little bits of shredded plastic in my drink, and it started leaking out the bottom. The fact that the blade is built in makes it very difficult to tighten. Too bad. I sent it back."
2,LOUD,Bought it to replace a Waring blender. The Kitchen Aid is mind blowingly LOUD. My neighbors can hear it! Might need to return it or buy earplugs.
2,Nice blender but jar leaked,"Had this for 18 months and used it primarily for smoothies 4 times a week. Loved it until the seal failed on the bottom. Unfortunately, it is not made to be repaired, so now I have to purchase another jar for $50. This problem has been reported by numerous others but I decided to take a chance. Now I wish I had learned from others' experiences."
4,Nice blender but......,I am pleased with the blender however I am concerned about the hard plastic drive shaft. I have blown out three blenders this year making morning smoothies. The motor on this one seems heavy duty but the hard plastic shaft troubles me since I am now seeing shavings of it left behind when I remove the pitcher. I am not sure how long it will last but I do have the warranty to fall back on. Its too bad they don't make some thing without all these plastic parts.
2,Blender blades are fragile!,"We don't use a blender frequently, so our blenders don't see hard use. The motor base on this one seems plenty powerful, but after about 10-15 uses, the blades in the blender container sheared in half while I was making a smoothie."
5,Fantastic Blender,Lightweight plastic jar is very nice and sturdy. The blender works exceptionally well and is very stylish. We are very happy with its performance and would recommend to anyone.
3,Does the job,"I used to have a brush with a combination of nylon quills and bristle and it did a great job. But eventually it broke and I couldn't find one to replace it until now. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about this brush. The size is good, the bristles are good, my problem is with the nylon quills. They are longer than the bristles (as they should be) but are just strands of nylon that have been cut straight across the end, which means that they are surprisingly scratchy! Couldn't they have rounded the ends? For the price, I think so. It does an ok job getting through my long hair, but my nylon Conair does it better. So now I brush with the Conair to remove the tangles, and follow up with the Denman to smooth the hair. On the plus side, it's pretty easy to clean - the air hole is on the tip of the brush, so is easy to cover when washing."
4,"Good for brushing, not for styling","This brush is made well and does a good job of untangling my hair, but it is difficult to use for anything other than simply brushing -- I can't do any styling with it, not even to pull my hair into a ponytail (a nylon brush would be better for that task). It would be nice if some sort of cleaning tool were included with the brush."
4,Good,"This brush is good. I was expecting a larger paddle and for it to be heavier but, it does a good job nonetheless. I have fine, color treated hair--- but very full. This brush tames it well and improves the texture. However, I do wish it were heavier in weight for more styling control."
2,Denman Brush,Average brush. Does not penetrate the scalp as well as I thought it would.Creates a lot of static.
3,It's OK!,"It looks made with too much plastic, it has not a good look, Denman could improve it. But the good thing is this brush works"
5,Great brush!,I have had this brush for years. I've used others but always come back to this one. It is my absolute favorite and it was time to get a new one. It just fits perfectly in my hand and the bristles are just right. I highly recommend it!
5,great brush,I bought this with a black 7-row Denman because hair brushes at home are always lost. I trust the Denman quality so this is just a great as our other Denman brushes. Great for styling after showers.
2,doll brush,Built to last as they say but the handle on the med is way too small. There is plenty of boar but the nylon is higher than the boar so does not penetrate thick hair and the handle made my hand VERY tired. Spornette Luxury is better for thick hair and feels nice brushing...but not built to last and made in china.
5,Very Nice Brush,Great brush...met expectations and more. Really helps with thin hair and hair that tangles easily. Puts a nice shine in it as well.
5,Sublime soloists,"This CD is of extremely high quality. The song soloist performances in particular are definetely the best available. One will have to wait for a long time for anything as good as this, including performances which will be able to match the clearness and virtuosity of the soloists, singers and accompagnement alike."
3,"""Let's get through this, shall we?""","I own several recordings of Bach's ""B-minor Mass,"" and this one is not at the top of the list. My current two favorites are the Herreweghe performance, followed by the Minkowski version.Gardiner seems to be saying to his performers, ""Let's get through this, shall we? I have another appointment and I don't want to be late..."" The tempii seem rushed; the horns sound strident rather than triumphal; the vocalists have trouble keeping up. There's something of a mechanical quality to the whole thing. It's as if Gardiner isn't aware of the religious significance of the piece, and sees it only as a series of notes to be generated. I certainly doubt that Gardiner's interpretation bears any similarity to the way this music would have been played in Bach's time.All in all, this surprised me, given that I generally like Gardiner's work. This performance just seems superficial."
4,"Lovely version, Note that it is sung in Italian Latin though","Italian Latin was the only Latin being taught when I first sang this decades ago. If learning to sing it with a choir director asking for German Latin, then this is not the recording for you. This recording will be great for those singing in Italian Latin however. Ultimately, you'll probably wish to own several recordings, if you adore this music as much as many of us do. For many, Bach's B Minor Mass is the culmination of everything wonderful in music, and all modern music and civilization owes Bach a great debt for it. It is as viscerally satisfying to sing and to listen to as eating excellent food, or seeing a great painting, and can even be a source of spiritual and emotional solace. Hooray for Bach!"
3,"High Quality, but...","I love this piece of music, so I decided to buy this CD, my second version of the Bach mass. I am not sorry I bought it, but like others have said, I am beginning to think that there is no ""perfect"" recording of this masterpiece. There are beautiful aspects to this recording: crystal clear sound quality, crisp but lush strings, lively tempos. The energy behind ""Cum Sancto"" and ""Gloria in Excelcis"" is nothing short of breathtaking. But... there is missing pathos in the first Kyrie. The ""Christe"" is not plaintive enough. I guess no recording will ever do justice to Bach's incredible accomplishment. His achievement is as much in the mind as it is in the sound of the performers. If you don't own a recording of the Bach Bm, by God buy one right away! This one or any other! But if you are trying to decide which one to buy, this one is good for lovers of clear sound, energy, and vitality. More melancholic, introspective, and angst-filled listeners should turn to other recordings."
5,Outstanding! A very special listening experience.,"I own three different versions of Bach's ""Mass in B Minor,"" and have listened to several others. This is without doubt the best version of this sacred masterpiece I've ever heard! The English Baroque Soloists, under the direction of John Eliot Gardiner, play brilliantly on period instruments, and The Monteverdi Choir and vocal soloists sing with tremendous warmth, freshness and vitality. The sound quality, as is usual for the Deutsche Grammophon label, is outstanding.Perhaps this version's strongest attribute is the wonderful spiritual quality with which it is played and sung, a reverence for the sacred which shines through in every measure. It makes this CD set a very special listening experience for me, and I'm sure it will do the same for any lover of Bach's music."
3,Odd noise?,"I don't have any particular complaints about the arrangement, but there's some extraneous noise throughout the piece (particularly evident in the first movement) which I find pretty annoying. Sloppy work by the recording engineers."
5,Beautiful,I have my entire music collection on my computer and sometimes like to put the whole thing on shuffle. The problem is that after something from this plays nearly everything else I have just sounds boring. This is some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard.
1,Is worthless too strog a word?,"Without images, this book conveys very little useful information. A picture may be worth a thousand words but the inverse is not so."
1,Save your money for another model,"I have had this planer for a year and it has worked OK. Snipe is a problem but can be corrected by shimming the in/out tables. One HUGE problem though, when I tried to change the knives for the first time, the little hex screws that release the knives round off. This happens even if you use a real wrench instead of the cheezey one they provide. And when the wrench slips, your knuckles go right into the blade. Once any of the 14 screws rounds off, that knife cannot be removed. And since the screws are buried in the cutting head you can't get any other kind of tool in help release the rounded screw. Along with most other models, the 12-1/2"" Delta model has a MUCH better design. Now I have to take mine in and have it repaired so I would have been money ahead by buying a better model."
4,"Hard-worker, but a little dull","I have owned a 22-540 for about 16 to 18 months now. It is a hard worker, but the blades tend to dull very quickly (paint will due a number on the blades). I have been using the planes to strip the old paint off of 1X4 Redwood trim. It was simpler and faster then sanding (and less mess with a dust collector). The paint will noticable dull the blades in a couple of bd ft. I have gone through 5 sets of blades so far. This is not exactly what the 540 was designed for, but no real compaints. Besides the dulling blades, I had one problem when I broke a drive gear. The repair was inexpensive and it has not given me any trouble since. I truely like the 540, but invest in a good sharpener for the blades. It's well worth it."
2,Nice looking chairs but not sturdy enough,"The chairs arrived quickly and were really adorable and nicely made, however, one of the chairs had fingerprint stains on it that wouldn't come off. Also, the chairs are NOT sturdy and I couldn't let my daughter sit in them because she would tip over in about two seconds. There is no counterweight in the bottom to keep them stable or upright. Overall I would not purchase again. The return process was really easy though."
3,ok I guess,"These stools are not expensive for how nice they look VISUALLY. Now; as far as quality, its on the cheap side. Its not leather in case you are wondering and it gets dirty extremely easy even if you are very careful like myself. I found out the best way to clean is with a little bit of bleach on a 100% white shoe sock and then just rub hard. The footrest came loose and just swivels around but I can live with it. I would have paid about 50.00 for the pair and I would have rated them 5 stars."
3,Alright,Good looking bar stool. Not the most sturdy. I bought 6 and 2 sink several inches when you sit on them. Could be a bit better quality but for the price they get the job done.
3,I would of rated it 4 star but,"You really cant ask for anything more considering the price. I would of rated it a four but just recently, my daughter was sitting on it wearing recently bought new black jeans. She actually was studying for a test and spent about two hours sitting in the chair. The color of her jeans somehow rubbed off on the chair and it will not wipe off. So one of our chairs now has a greyish hue to it. I had her sit in another chair and the same thing happened.Thats really disappointing but had I paid more; i propabaly would have returned the items."
4,Looking good and easy to assemble,"Received the 2 bar stools without any problems. Assembly only took 5 min and the tool is included.The bar stools look good in front of my white kitchen island without blocking the view of the island.They are pretty confortable, especially the seats (not so much the back rest, but better than without any back rest), but not for sitting for hours.I hope they will last a long time, but I can't complain for $100 with shipping included."
5,great look,"The chairs arrived very well packed and in impeccable condition. They were also easy to assemble. However, I agree with one of the reviewers: the instructions were not all that clear. You need to remove the plastic cap on the top of the bar to action the hydraulic motion (the up and down). I didn't do that with one of them, but figured it out and did it to the second chair. All in all, a great value, very modern and streamlined look. They are sturdy enough and look much more expensive than what you pay for them (under $80). I am very pleased with this purchase and I seriously doubt you could find anything to match the quality and the looks in this price range."
2,Not comfy for larger people,"A bit tricky to assemble, the directions are crap. For larger wider people these are not very good. Ok for kids or pony size people. I got some similar ones with a higher back and no sides, these were much better for our family."
5,Way better than Pull-ups,"We recently switched to Goodnites from Pull-ups at night for our nearly 3 year old toddler twins and find that they do a wonderful job keeping them dry at night. While they are a little big and hang low in the mornings, there is no leaking. Prior to the switch, we were using a Pull-up with an overnight diaper over the top. Cumbersome and a total pain. Highly recommend this product if you find the Pull-ups aren't working for you."
3,They are a good product,The only thing we can complain about is the price. These always cost alot more than other pull ups. But they hold alot
1,Several were torn,"I have not finished the whole pack yet, but at least five have been torn to the point that my daughter could not wear them. I have gotten these in the smaller size and did not have this problem. I would not recomend buying them from this seller."
5,Great product,These good nights are great for my 4 year old. The regular pull ups were starting to get too small for her to wear to bed.
5,This is THE travel guide for Kenya,"I was simply stunned by the number of detailed maps in this book. The amount of information for each region of Kenya is outstanding and well done. If you need to know it - it's in this book. Hotels, restaurants, parks, reserves, tribes, Swahili it's all here. Very nicely organized."
3,"Comprehensive, but not the best out there.","This book was somewhat helpful when I recently spent two months in Kenya, but I found that some of the information was out of date (despite this being an updated edition) and there were many things that should have been mentioned that were not. Although it gives a great overview, for those who are going to be spending a substantial amount of time in Kenya, I would probably opt for the Rough Guide to Kenya, which was more thorough and much more accurate."
5,a must for traveling in Kenya,This book is perfect for traveling the roads of Kenya. I used it when I spent 9 months in Kenya. It lists every detail of the area very accurately. I would not travel without it.
2,"grossly insufficient, just talk,talk, much better FROMMER'S KENYA AND TANZANIA","My title says everything, having house in Kenya and some years experience, before planning my trips, I read both and confronted with what I know for certain, I must say that Frommer's Kenya and Tanzania is much more useful than the two books from Lonely Planet which together cost twice."
2,Not worth the money!,"If this is your first trip to Kenya, this might be helpful for general information - locations, maps, etc. I bought the newest edition to update the 2009 and so much of the information is totally inaccurate. We spent two weeks in Nairobi and are finishing two weeks in Lamu and so many current places are absent and so many reviewed are no longer here. The price information is much less than one encounters in hotels and restaurants. Locals actually laugh at the glowing descriptions in the book. One highly recommended hotel is a well known brothel!. One wonders if anyone actually visited these places for the update. It would be humorous except that it is a disservice to both the traveler and the providers of service. My advice is buy another guide book!!"
5,"Excellent, Accuarte, and Helpul Information",I used this book while living in Nairobi for 3 months. It was especially helpful for planning my excursions around the country. My Kenyan friends couldn't believe how helpful it was. They didn't even know where to get the kind of information the book provides. I wouldn't travel to Kenya without it!
4,Kenya travel guide,LOts of good information for my upcoming trip. Will take it with me to refer as I travel.
4,"Cool, but no PIM-sync capability","I bought this organizer but took it back when I realized it couldn't be syncronized with Outlook or other PIM apps. Too bad too, because it and other Sharp organizers are easy to use with the built in keyboard, and are loaded with features. Unfortunately, you can only backup the organizers data onto a Sharp personal organizer file on your hard disk. Buy this if you don't mind entering in all your own data."
3,Does not have XP link!!!,"Purchased this to replace Wizard that does not offer PC link with XP-pro. This one does not ALSO. I spoke to Sharp and they say it is not compatable with the ""new"" software. Number keys are small. Still a good value for the $."
4,hi,"i have not used this yet but i was thinking about getting this for my daughter she wanted a organizer with a speaker,dose this one come with a speaker"
5,Best Album of '99,"Since ""Wind and Wire"" is no longer, I wanted to post here that this would be my pick as ""Best Album of '99"". My complete review from Issue 10 is also on this page."
5,Brilliant Progressive Rock,"With the release of Pepper's Ghost, once again the British progressive rock band Arena has created ""candy for the ears"" for progressive rock fans.As with all Arena releases the music combines powerful compositions that ebb and flow through subtle moments to majestic passages that make for truly great progressive rock. Once again, flawlessly performed, and after listening 3 or 4 times you are hooked...and life is good.If you've never listened to them before...you're lucky...because you have an entire back catalogue of great progressive rock awaiting you. Enjoy this great music!"
4,Not Marillion,"I wouldn't bash Marillion either. Agree their best days are now far away, but those guys were a great band in their time and Mick Pointer was with them only at the begining. If you can get the Recital for Script DVD, he still in charge of the drums. My opinion about Arena is that they've become less aggressive and their earlier albums are better. But this is still very good.Enjoy"
2,No Soul,"I have recently starting purchasing Arena CD's. I started withthe Visitor and I enjoyed it. Pepper's Ghost has no heart to it in my humble opinion. I gave it 3 solid listens and it simply has the feel of 1 long song. It's lacking vocal melody. It seems very formulated and I heard nothing that made me want to listen to it again. I compared it to other artists in the same vein such as IQ. Where as IQ explores several different feels in their music (Harvest of Souls is a prime example),Pepper's Ghost just drones on in the same vein for the expanse of the CD. I will continue to buy Arena's CD's but this one will not get more than 2 stars from me."
2,Lounge piano lovers' delight,"This guy managed to make 10 songs sound like 1 song - congratulations. I don't know about stirring up Beach Boys memories, but it will bring back plenty of others- white pianos on shag carpet, 70's pastel tuxedos, Holiday Inn Tiki Bar, polyester slacks, etc."
4,Great--as long as you don't have chemical sensitivities,"I bought this item hoping it would work for guests at my b&b, many of whom are chemically sensitive. The exterior is great but the interior is lined with something that is definitely off-gassing hugely--even I have headaches from it, and I'm not very sensitive. In time it will improve, hopefully, and until then I can put it at my cabin. Fine if you're a regular person. I wish furniture manufacturers use non-chemical stuff in furniture--it really can't be good for any of us in the long run."
5,excellent,"Came faster than I could believe, and it's an exact match to the one that originally came on my timex 5+ years ago. Love the water-resistant characteristics and the look. sturdy yet low-key enough that you can wear it when getting a little dressed up!"
4,Great debugger!,"This makes a lot of bug spray; actually too much for my needs. It works after several applications. I have used this during the winter, indoors, only and don't know its effectiveness on outdoor plants. Time will tell."
4,Better than all that poison I've been using,"Our vegetables haven't looked this good since we planted them back in April/May. Great on the ornamentals also. Still have to keep a watch on everything and respray when needed but at least I don't feel like I'm poisoning myself, my family and the environment (and the good insects are more abundant now too). If I were going to use it on indoor plants, I'd take them outside to spray. The odor doesn't last long but it isn't pleasant...but then neither are any other insecticides, fungicides, etc. that I've tried."
3,Ineffective against Asiatic Garden Beetles,"This year Asiatic Garden Beetles infested many of the gardens in my area. They were particularly damaging to young basil and lemon balm. Spraying Neem oil on the young plants at the maximum recommended strength did not deter AGBs in the slightest. Spraying the beetles directly didn't appear to have any significant impact either. Patrolling the garden at night to capture and kill the beetles by hand prevented the plants from being destroyed completely. Once established, the basil grew so rapidly that there was plenty for humans and bugs to share. Come mid-August the beetles appeared to die off on their own or perhaps migrate."
1,Disappointed!,"For some unknown reason after years of going without any pests I have an infestation of white flies. I used the Neem, according to the directions, on my flowering plants and instead of killing the white flies they seem to be thriving. I have a lot of humming birds and I need something that won't harm them. If I don't find something soon I'll have to cut my plants down to the ground and wait until next year for them to grow back. I am really disappointed with this product."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this and have applied it twice, and I'm sorry I even wasted my money on this product. I may even seek a refund.I sprayed this two days ago, and there are still ants farming aphids and other bugs around the garden. Plus, my plants still have a little bit of fungus, but that's not why I bought this.This product, is worthless."
4,Tomatoes look better...,"I guess I should have waited for 30 days or so to give a comprehensive review, but I put this concentrate on a few days ago, and there is no new infestation or blite. Looks good for now."
5,The Essential Rosemary Clooney cd,"Good price and if you've not had the pleasure of hearing Clooney sing, do yourself a favor and get this cd. If you love a mellow voice, you'll adore Clooney!"
5,The Best Analysis of 'Moral Sentiments',"Jerry Muller (The Mind and the Market) said this is the best commentary on Adam Smith's 'Moral Sentiments' and he is right! Griswold provides a thoughtful and understandable analysis of Smith's 'theory' of moral sentiments.His explanation of the 'actor' and the 'spectator', the 'impartial spectator', the conscience,and just what 'morality' means to Smith are so clear. Griswold raises possible objections to Smith's system and answers them satisfactorily, showing a keen 'sympathy' with the topic he is so ably handling.This book is a must, not only for Smith scholars, but for anyone interested in what morality is all about and how it all developed (and is still developing).Buy this great work and have a mental and moral feast!"
3,A Solid Effort!,"Put on your scuba gear - we're diving down deep. Even though Charles L. Griswold, Jr. writes in a dense, academic style, it is worth swimming through his prose to learn about the remarkable work of 18th-century Enlightenment philosopher Adam Smith. Regarded as one of the fathers of modern economic thought, Smith has been misunderstood for the last century because his ethical philosophy has been overlooked. Instead, economists have drawn attention only to his thumbs-up for free enterprise and free trade. Smith believed neither was worthwhile without ethics, a point some modern economists might profitably revisit. We [...] highly recommend this richly detailed, insightful book to anyone interested in economic, political, or social philosophy."
4,Where's Spot?,That's what you find out when you open all the flaps in the book to help Olie look for Spot. My 19-month old son loves this book!
2,"The last gasp of an aged, dated theory","What Gimbutas offers, basically, is a version of the old Aryan myth with a different spin. She invites you to root for the other side. The Indo-European conquerors were cruel, ""patriarchal"" warlords who displaced a universal cultural utopia that once prevailed throughout Europe. At least for the Indo-Europeans, we know what they shared: a language, at least. The construction of this monolithic culture requires that some faceless dolls or the curlicues on pottery must bear a great load of symbolic meaning.If the Aryan myth is wrong, then Gimbutas cannot be right."
4,great reference material,"Although difficult to get through some sections, I found the pictures and graphics wonderful and the undeniable female influence on our earliest history came through without any sexist or biased undertones. Men as well as women would benefit from reading this book, if not from cover to cover at least the high points and the last two chapters. And any mother of a young woman should consider this book for a special gift to her."
3,"Good, but definitely one-sided","This is a good book and worthy of reading. HOwever, one must remember that Gambutas' interpretation of archeological findings are far from unchallenged.The idea of a ""peaceful matriarchy"" is challenged by many various archeologists and historians, as is the idea that the Goddes cult reigned alone in earlier years.While referring to various Venus statues, Gambutas tends to ignore other symbols and artefacts (the various cave paintings showing a ""half man/half beast"" comes to mind) that are equally old.To paraphrase (and slightly modified) Hilda Davidson in ""Roles of the Northern Goddes"" (which I consider a more balanced book), Gambutas' interpretations and research merit much consideration, but should not necessarily taken as the whole gospel."
1,Does not work with iPhone 3GS,"This charger does not work with iPhone 3GS. A error message pops up on my iPhone 3GS screen saying ""Charging is not supported with this accessory"".I called the DataVision customer service department to request the refund only to find out that they refuse to pay the shipping fee for the return. They were claiming that this product is not supposed to work with iPhones and it is Amazon.com's fault to put a wrong description of the product. I'm really disappointed by the way they treat their customers and Amazon putting a wrong description of the product."
3,investigación de mercados contemporanea,"I haven't read the book, I am interesting in knowing more about marketing, so I want to know if this book, is appropiate for me, in order to know more about the new techiniques of seaching marketing"
4,goes well with the set,"Use it for some some coffee, or use them for milk as every one in my family does...We tend to fill these as extra glasses of milk for every one at the holiday dinners; my mother hates having the plastic milk jug on the nicely prepared dining room table."
5,Love these puzzles,"I had one of these when i was a kid and loved it, my 2 year old loves them still. Best of all the company will replace pieces you loose. Cute too."
1,Terrible. Just terrible.,"I heard a couple of Bloodless Pharaoh songs on the CD ""Marty Thau Presents"" and they were great, so I bought this hoping for more good songs. What a disappointment. It sounds like it was recorded at a basement party, the sound quality is awful and the songs are worse. Get the ""Marty Thau Presents"" CD and skip this piece of trash. Learn from my mistake!"
4,skillet,Excellent value for the money. Heats evenly with no hot spots. Very light and easy to handle.
5,great griddle,"this is a wonderful griddle. it is very easy to clean provided you don't use any kind of scrubbing materials and mess up the coating. it is perfect for cooking bacon, eggs, pancakes, hamburgers, etc. i've done it all. it's great."
4,Watch Out I'ts NOT Dishwasher Safe,"After reading the cleaning instructions, I discovered that Farberware does not recommention you use a dishwasher. Amazon has incorrectly stated that it is. So if you are looking for a dishwasher safe pan, don't buy this one."
1,alleged stainless steel griddle of aluminum?,"Hi Folks,I can't say much about this product as I will not buy one, but it strikes me as false advertising to label this as Stainless Steel when it's obviously aluminum with a non-stick surface."
4,Does the job!,"When buying those kind, one doesn't expect for it to be perfect. All you expect is that it doesn't break. And this one doesn't."
5,G.P.T. Never Sounded Better,"The first moments of Telemann's Concerto in D major for Transverse Flute are for me perhaps the most delicious seconds in all of Baroque music. So captivating, that beginning seems to transcend time period, feeling as if it could have been written just yesterday. That beginning is the start of this wonderful disc featuring six wind concertos by Telemann. The pieces themselves are by turns buoyant, inventive and sublime, and the playing by Musica Antiqua Koln under Reinard Goebel is about as close to perfection as one could ever hope for. Of all the Telemann albums I've heard, this remains my favorite. Indeed, this is on my short list of favorite Baroque releases, period, making the best possible case for the composer's talent an inspiration. Highly recommended."
5,This recording is great!,"It is easy to understand why Telemann was more popular than Bach when they were both living after listening to this superb recording which I believe to be the best disc of Baroque music I have ever heard.....I appreciate Bach, but this music just "" pops "" unlike the majority of Bach's maths derived obtuse musical tomes. I cannot recommend a disc more highly."
4,A Concise Masterpiece,"This short opera is perhaps Purcell's finest work. Beautiful music, and unlike Purcell's semi-operas, Dido and Aeneas has a dramatic integrity that gives the work real direction. This is one of Purcell's last works. This is a fine performance with excellent orchestral and vocal work. My only reservation is that while Von Otter sings Dido very well, her singing lacks the fire of Lorraine Hunt's performances. Purcell died in his mid-30s. A real pity. He was already a master of traditonal Baroque forms and apparently beginning to change his style under the influence of Italian derived innovations. Another decade or two of life might have resulted in more works like Dido. A nice bonus of this recording are the particularly good liner notes describing the sources of Dido, its interesting early performance history, and the fact that it was probably intended in part as an allegorical warning to King William."
3,a little expensive and a little too small,I loved the size of the bag and that its hands free but it doesn't stay closed. The velcro isn't very strong and as soon as I would bend over everything would fall out! I would recommend the product if the flap would stay secure.
2,Coming upart stiches,"Love that its compact and easy to use. Hate that its not sturdy. I've had my bag for a month, and already it has broken in two places. First, the stiches have become unsewed due to the fact that the material is very thing and doesn't support the weight suggested by the web description. Second, in a couple compartments the stiches have come apart by minimal use."
1,remember our troops and their sacrifices during WW2,"I bought this film for a friend who has enjoyed it. I will borrow and see it soon. It would not be right for me torate this film at this time. However, I have heard others say it is very good. thankl you--Joanne"
4,great buy for its pupose,"I recieved this item four days after submitting that i wanted to buy it from the dealer. it wasn't supposed to arrive for another ten days though. i thought ""great now i can try it out sooner"". i went to try it out, and it rocks! it can cut almost any thing, and its very sharp!pros:*easily concieled*sharp*nice suraded edgescon:*too small to be good for much"
5,The New Reign,"This is without a doubt one of the best L.O.T.F.R. books written by Edward Blume. A new writer to the series, he does the already fantastic series justice. Taking place a little after ""The Lion"" this is the prelude to the for winds saga. I look forword to reading the next books in the series. I would recommend this book to any one interested in Asian folklore books."
1,"Help, how do I install this?","I have tried several times to install this item, no luck. There were no instructions in the box and the holes don't line up. I even tried Delta's website for instructions, no luck there either. If anyone knows how to install this on a TP305 please tell me.I bought the dust collector chute and the planer as a package. The dust collector chute says it is for Delta models TP400LS, 22-565 and 22-560 not TP305 so I was a little worried about it working when I bought it.ThanksMark"
5,"""Ya gotta have this""","This is a must have, if you are using the Delta 22-560 planer. It not only collects the dust, but a good 90% of the chips as well. The fit is excellent and only takes a couple of minutes to install. If you are using a wet/vac for dust control it may not work as well, but if you have a 4"" system this is the cat's meow.I'm going to two stage my collection system so the chips fall into a ""can"", because you can really fill the bag on the vac quickly when you are planing a lot of material. Delta got this one right."
4,Great part - should ship standard,"This is a much needed part. Using a 4"" to 2 1/2"" adaptor, you can hook this up to your shop vac. It picks up most of the dust and chips. I used the planner without this part and it was a mess. The only reason this part did not recieve 5 stars is that I felt that Delta should include it as a standard to their planner as it is a much needed feature.I wish that the web site for the planner had a link to this part. I initially ordered the wrong part and had to return it. I had to research for the part number via the Delta web site and then order it. But worth the pain as it is a great addition to a good tool."
4,Red is a hoot,"I am a huge Red Green fan. As usual Red and his friends a up to their unique antics. If you like the unusual with just a bit of truth and warm fuzzy blended in, this is for you."
5,"Older Edition, Worth it!","I ordered this book for a class that required the new edition. I had the opportunity to look at both editions and they are quite similar. The photos have been updated and there may be new addition added, such as current topics of reality tv, things of that nature. I've been able to complete every assignment with this older version with no problem. If you're a college student like me looking to save tons of $$, buy this older edition, you won't regret it!"
4,The Prince & Me,"True, it has a story line which we all know will have the ""Happy Ending"" [This is why I choose the film to begin with]. Yet it's how the path is taken that I found so sweet. I like the feeling I have after watching this film. I do have several favorite scenes. The laundry room scene where he helps her understand the language of Shakespeare's Sonnets. ""The Sun itself sees not till heaven clears"" Rarely do people say what they really mean, he explains. The scene at her family's home, his reply to her answer regarding the push pins on the map. The parade scene, the name ""Paige"" is chanted as the people point to her so that ""Eddie"" can find her. He breaks all rules, turning his horse to go to the one he loves.So yes, it is a story line we all know, but this 44 year old woman likes this film very much."
4,"Decent quality, could be better","Like all Curt products, this one looks ok when new. The paint quality is average and only lasts a year or two here in the salty winters before flaking off. Metal preparation seems to be missing with the cost cutting.Another annoyance: I used to have an acct. and received 'jobber' pricing directly from Curt. When I called regarding this one, the price they quoted was almost $50 more, PLUS shipping, than what I paid here through a reseller. Odd business concept.All in all, for what I paid here for it, not a bad deal. Had I paid full 'jobber' rate I might have looked elsewhere for a hitch this time around."
4,Good hitch for the money,"I purchased this hitch for a 2003 VW Passat. It installed rather easy but be prepared to do some tactful drilling. The holes could not be drilled from under the car so I had to drill a small pilot hole at an angle and the drill another small hole from inside the trunk and then drill the larger hole and ""hope to get it in the right spot. I also manufactured a brace for the two bolts to re-enforce them as I was not to confident in the washers that came with the hitch. I would suggest having an extra pair of hands to help out and I believe you should be somewhat mechanically incline to install it. Final product looks good on the car though. I don't regret buying it. Good luck."
3,Mel McDaniel - Louisiana Man,"Don't be fooled by this CD. While it IS recorded by the original artist, it is NOT the original recording! Yes, it is Mr. Mel McDaniel doing the singing however it has obviously been recorded years after the original and the voice, while similar, is not the same...and the change is not for the better. I missed the small print on the face of the CD which did fully disclose that fact. All in all, not a terrible CD, it's just that I was expecting the original recordings. Don't make the same mistake!"
5,Colts bike,This was my boy's favorite Christmas gift! It was easy to put together. Shipping was super fast! Thanks!
3,missing parts,We purchased this bicycle for our daughter's 3rd birthday gift. Imagine her disappointment when we were putting the bike together and there were parts missing and she couldn't ride it.
4,JUST FOR STEELERS FANS,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY BOY , AND HE LOVE IT. THE SEASON IT'S ALMOST HERE AND NOTHING BETTER TO REMIND IT THAN THIS BEAUTIFUL BIKE. GO STEELERS."
3,But is the microC usefull?,"This book was certainly an excellent overview of designing applications for the IXP1200, and got me quite excited about the prospect of using Intel's microC to code applications for the board. Untill I found out that one can't program ACEs in microC that is.What is the use of microC (all the book really covers) when you can't even use it to compeltely projects in the main paradigm of the embeded environment? This book would have deserved a 5/5 if the examples and projects had been in IXP1200 microcode instead."
4,A very versatile saw,A Best Buy! This saw is well worth the extra dollars vs the 36/220 or the 36/075 models. It's 15 pounds lighter than the 220 and can be readily moved from site to site. Compared to the 075 model it has a more powerful 15 amp motor and come with the support extensions and work clamp!
5,I can't believe it's made in Taiwan!!,"This saw cut accurately right out of the box. I only had to make very minor adjustments. It comes with a decent carbide tipped blade, too.The d-handle grip is very user friendly and the saws power is very smooth and predictable. The instruction book includes a very easy to construct extension table that is made from 2x4's.I've used this saw for about 8 months on a weekly basis and the only shortcoming I've come up with is that the dust bag could be made out of better material. In my opinion, it's the best saw out there for the money."
1,Waste of time,"Trolling the school web sites gave me more information than this book. It's very factual and really doesn't get into school character, etc."
1,Not Helpful At All,"This book is just fine if all you want is the private school closest to you, or want very cut and dry facts which you can find for free at the schools websites or in their prospectus. If you are looking for insider information, or anything to tell you what the school is really like, look elsewhere. I recommend saving your money for your kid's education."
1,Item Didn't Match The Photo Or Description,"Item arrived quickly and was nicely packaged. However, the Oval Carnelian Ring looked nothing like the photo on the Internet and I had to return it. Instead of being a nice, rich, blood red color with a high clear dome, it was a orange rust color with flat stone (very plain looking). I had to return it."
5,csi,too many people are leaving the show but it carries on because they are replaced by solid actors and the cases remain interesting. i can't wait to see the next episode.
1,UNBOUGHT ITEM,"I HAVE NOT PURCHASED THIS ITEM, I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS ON MY REVIEW. I AM SURE IT IS A GOOD ITEM, BUT I CANNOT GIVE A GOOD REVIEW."
3,disapointing... a generous rating^^,"I have to disagree with alot of theese reviews on this cold 187um album. Let me start off by saying im a HUGE Above The Law fan i have all their albums except for vocally pimpin and i have not yet recieved rich thugs.This Album was very disapointing to me i expected better beats, better flows, an simply just a better album i know you have to let ATL albums grow on you but this just isnt cuttin it. the only real good song on here is the one with xzibit an a couple other ok ones but i dont even know how to back up my review because this just is a total disapointment.I gave it three stars but it is really 2and a half at best. His second album live from the ghetto sounds better i have to buy that one.hopefully not as disapointing"
3,The G-Funk Godfather goes solo...,"I must say that I expected more from a talented artist like Hutch. Above The Law is still one of my favourite groups and Hutch is a great producer, but after the releases of ""Executive Decisions"" and ""Forever - Rich Thugs"" I've startet to doubt West World(their new label). The whole style has changed from something original and phat to weird beats and ugly cover art work(hehe). Hutch used to work his beats so that his sound matched his (and KMG's) ill flow. Don't get me wrong the album isn't all bad. Tracks like ""Lost Angels"" and ""2 Killas"" is mad sweet. And his high pitched voice and gangsta lyrics makes this album an average west coast release."
1,Linksys admitted this product is defective!,"This product works fine when it doesn't die. A couple of times a day it loses connection and needs to be reset. After talking to multiple Linksys customer service reps, they finally admitted that this is a common problem that cannot be fixed unless your ISP has the latest firmware. STAY AWAYAndy: you really think it's defective even though the last one did the same thing?Maria U. (24652): Yes, it is actually a known issue with the device. Our product engineers are currently working on it and we are consistently looking for a specific fix for it.Andy: ok well if its a known issue then i'm just going to buy a non linksys oneMaria U. (24652): I do apologize Andy. I do understand your point."
2,Disappointing,"Cisco and Linksys must have parted ways with this item. Every time I restart a computer on my LAN, I usually have to reboot the WCG200. Wanna lock in a static IP for a device? Forget it. The modem works, but if you need advanced wireless configurations, this current v2 is lacking. Comcast recommended it, Linksys built it, I bought it, but there hasn't been a firmware update for 2 years. It looks good, though."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This combo cable gateway and wireless router seems like a dream come true. Instead, should you fail to heed my warning and purchase this item, you'll be subjected to a nightmare that will only end when you seek another wireless solution.As a cable gateway the WCG200 performs as expected. Setup with my ISP (Cox in southern California) was a breeze. I was up and running in no time.Wireless connectivity, however, has been an absolute nightmare. None of my devices (laptops, bridge, print server) will stay connected for any length of time. When the router is performing well, I'm lucky to stay connected for an hour. When the router is performing poorly I can barely stay connected for 15 seconds.The Linksys forums are crowded with other users reporting the same problem. I've been unable to find any official acknowledgement or response from Linksys.Do yourself a favor and avoid the WCG200. You will regret purchasing it."
1,Drops connections constantly,"I have had this gateway for over a year and it drops the wireless connection whenever one downloads a bigger file or connects to some retail web site (the connection is dropped, and I have to reset the box for no discernible reason). I thought it might be my internet provider, until a friend complained of the same problems, which he solved by swapping to a different gateway. I would not recommend this product."
1,waste of money,"Just looking at the other reviews makes me wish I had read them before purchasing this. Like the others, I was trying to eliminate some cables. Yes this unit allows you to do that. At first I only had occassional connectivity problems. Within 2 months, I can not use wireless unless I am in the same room as the box because it must be reset every 10 minutes or so due to loss of wireless connection. Even hardwiring to the unit losses connection frequestly. I was on for 26 minutes this morning and had to reset the box 4 times..... Absolutely unacceptable. Checking out reviews now before heading to the store to replace this piece of trash. I have used my neighbors wireless more this week than I have my own........"
3,Linksys wireless cable gateway,"The product is a good router. It does lose signal sometimes and you have to go reset it to gain internet again, but for the most part I would reccommend it to others."
1,DROPPING CONNECTION,"This router is the worst one i have ever seen, and I have seen many of them...It has a design problem, the wireless connection drops of every 15-60 minutes, especially when there is a high bandwidth usage...don't buy, even if it looks cheap and great, it's a swindle.I warned you. You do what you want. But trust me: You don't want to return it one week later, pay restocking fees and all of that stuff.You should buy instead 2 separate machines: one modem and one wireless router."
1,Avoid at all cost!!!!,This thing doesn't deserve a single star. Do a search on this product and you'll find scores of unhappy consumers. Linksys (Cisco) knows they have a problem with this product and blame the ISP.
2,Couldn't make it work,"I attempted to replace my rented cable modem with thisproduct. I spent one hour on the phone with a Comcast technician, but was unable to get a connection. I thenspent an additional hour on the phone with a Linksystechnician, but still counldn't make it work. She suggestedthat I return it, which I did. Linksys service is fine, butthis product appears to have been defective."
3,linksys wireless cable modem,"Item seems to work well, but when using wireless and hard connected sometimes have to power off the router for it to connect. Overall works GREAT."
1,Do not buy,The worst thing Ive ever bought. Lose internet connection randomly. Can't be fixed. Never buy it
1,Horrible product. DO NOT BUY,"As most of the other reviews here state, this router cannot hold a connection. Wired connection works fine for several hours, then drops. Wireless connection is lost without fail after several minutes when connecting with a wireless device requiring a hard reboot. To make matters worse, WEP security settings are lost from time to time after several reboots. It's a shameful, shameful product."
4,Solid Performer Great Price,I bought this refurbished and the price was much lower than new. It is factory conditioned and tested and since they lack moving parts and are intended for years of use with a warranty I had nothing to lose.With this gateway I am not paying the cable company lease charges on the cheapest modem they can acquire and I have consolidated two components into one.
1,Chiming in with the rest of the crowd,"Luckily for me I didn't waste my own money on this, got it as a gift. Same essential issue everyone else is reporting - ~2-10 times per day ""something"" happens such that a complete re-boot of the gateway is required. It seems to do a little better when only a single device is connected wirelessly, but once there are 2+ computers going, it doesn't have a chance. If you're willing to tolerate it, I've gotten probably 2ish years' service out of it. Figure Comcast charges $3/mo to rent a cable modem from them, which means this device probably just about breaks even if you figure 24 months of almost-working *$3 = $72, plus the cost of a separate wireless router."
1,The absolute in wireless GARBAGE!,"When we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the Cisco label. When we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and NO TECH SUPPORT!If you read the boards on the Linksys site you'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different ISP's and areas of the US since this item has been released. PLEASE don't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage, you'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through!"
3,It worked great in the beginning...,"I bought mine about 9 months ago because I was always having to reboot my old modem and router. I got this and it worked great until about 3 weeks ago. Now I've been getting the run around from comcast and linksys about it and got a replacement from linksys with the exact same problem. Whenever I download a file on a wireless computer from the internet, I'll get up to about 7 megs done and the gateway will reset the connection. The new one does the exact same thing. I just had a tech from comcast here for about 2 hours trying things and escalating to their higher support and now their solution is to go with a motorola. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,Very Unreliable,"Truly a nightmare as most reviewers have said. This device has a VERY hard time not dropping the connection at light loads. You will lose connection to this router just by thinking about a higher load such as even a voice chat. That is wired or wireless. Once the connection is gone, it will take 3 or sometimes 4 restarts of the device before it can be ""seen"" or allow access to the internet. I'm going through warranty as we speak.DO NOT BUY."
1,dear linksys: a router is supposed to stay connected to the internet,"we got stuck with this model when signing up for our cable/internet package. gee, thanks. after a frustrated google search, i now realize we are far from the only ones experiencing connectivity problems with the WCG200 V2. being knocked offline several times a day is aggravating, to say the least. but for our resident telecommuter it means losing hours of work on a regular basis. unacceptable!"
1,AVOID LINKSYS,"If you are considering buying a router or modem...DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM LINKSYS!I can not stress this enough. They have ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They will not help you in any way, shape or form and they DO NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET OR ON THEIR WEBSITE FOR FREE. You must PAY FOR SUPPORT."
1,AVOID! MAJOR DISCONNECT PROBLEMS.,"At my wife's relatives house for the holidays. They've had the unit since 2006. Worked fine until about a year ago when constant disconnects started. I've spent hours searching through Linksys forums and other forums looking for a solution for them and basically the only possible answer is a firmware upgrade (or downgrade) that has to be pushed down to your unit by your cable provider. Good luck with that. Almost everyone reports a major hassle and hours spent trying to get through the outer tier of customer service reps to someone who actually has a clue. And, no, it's not user firmware upgradeable. Apparently neither Linksys nor the cable companies are taking the initiative to resolve this for their customers. Unless you like a lot of pain, just buy something else. I'm going to just go buy the relatives another (non-Linksys) unit.[...]"
4,It works ok but,I have been with this wireless machine for almost 3 years now and the only problem with it is when I move it around the internet is gone and I have a hard time getting back online but it works you just have to be gentle :)
1,1 out of 3 is bad!,"this product will last 2years, if your'e lucky. Great features, but if router or modem doesn't function your'e up the creek. If you do decide to buy it or any other product buy directly from amazon.com (not someone selling on amazon.com . I got taken for $200 that way with no way to get my money back!)"
2,Not D3 standard compliant.,I have always had great service from Linksys products but this one arrived damaged. I then found out it did not support Docsis 3 standard which my carrier has upgraded. The supplier was very responsive with allowing return of the product but I still lost out on the shipping both ways.
1,"Drops connection frequently, Look at other reviews as well.. and do yourself a favour - Buy motorola SBG900 instead","The basic problem with this router is that the connection drops frequently. Its so annoying when i am attending a webex or interwise sessions with my colleagues. It reflects poorly on me at my work..I had to switch off and switch on frequently to get the internet connection. It happens atleast twice in a day for me.. It seems this problem prevails among other as well and rampantly.And the Linksys service sucks. It really sucks big time.. They ask you the same stupid questions which lead you or them to no where.. And guess what, even if you could convince them to replace your router with another brand new one, there is a high chance that it might malfunction just like your old one.. So, this is your chance before you buy a new one, to save the trouble and instead go with motorola.."
1,DON'T BUY THIS AWFUL PIECE OF .... EQUIPMENT,"I bought this unit thinking a combined cable modem and wireless router was a great idea, and how could I go wrong with a Linksys? Boy was I sadly mistaken. My ISP is Comcast (in San Francisco). Although hooking up the unit and configuring it was fairly hassle-free, the unit very quickly showed its principle weakness: it loses the connection to the internet *very* frequently, necessitating a power shutoff.I figured that calling Linksys tech support would solve my problems. Dealing with Linksys tech support achieved nothing other than convincing me to never buy a Linksys product again. Their so-called tech support was an insulting, infuriating waste of time.Bottom line: the WCG200 is defective by design, and Linksys tech support is a waste of time."
3,Cisco Cable Modem,"Connectivity is great until the wireless feature is activated. When it's turned on, the connection will get bumped about every 2-3 hours consistantly. Contacted the ISP to see if there was an updated firmware, none were available. The ISP and Linksys Support were unable to locate a remedy for this issue. Apparently instability with the wireless feature turned on is a common issue with this model."
1,Worst Wireless Router Imaginable,Transmit more than 20kbps for 20 minutes over the wireless and the router crashes. Linksys has never fixed the problem and doesn't intend to. I'm horrified that this worthless product is still on the market.
1,Firmware Problem with Comcast,"I just spent many hours with Comcast and Linksys tech support. The gateway drops the connection after about 30 minutes and must be rebooted.What happened is that the cable companies made a change to their system. The gateway no longer worked. Linksys fixed it in an update to their firmware version 2.0.3.9.31. The earlier versions will not work.The problem is that the cable systems control all updates to firmware. Even if Linksys were to update the firmware the cable system would overwrite it with the version they currently support.I am a Comcast customer and they will give no indication as to if and when they will push out the update. Consequently, this gateway cannot work on my cable system.Be very cautious before buying this. I suggest getting a separate modem and router. I understand that the CM-100 cable modem has relatively few issues."
1,locks up and crashes often,"I made the mistake of purchasing 2 of these units in the mistaken belief that the first unit's misbehavior would be fixed by the replacement. They both acted exactly alike by consistently locking up every few hours. This required a power off and on to get internet access back on.I have since then replaced this junky gateway with a Motorola Surfboard gateway unit that performed reliably.It is unconscionable that Linksys would continue to make and sell such a poorly designed unit that is so obviously flawed. It is obvious by a simple google search that there is plenty of information about this typical unreliable behavior that they are just hoping for more suckers to purchase this unit. Well, don't. It's not worth it."
2,WCG200 Just Plain Bad...,"I will keep it simple... I bought it t save money/space by combining devices into one. I have found it to be sketchy, difficult, unreliable, frustrating and overpriced considering the affore-mentioned issues. DO NOT buy this device, it will not improve anything in your life. For $115.00, I feel ripped off!"
1,Lost Synch,"When using wireless and doing medium/large transfers, looses synch (Connectivity State: In Progress Not Synchronized) and brings down the whole modem, wired and wireless. Requires a complete power cycle reset to clear the problem. Very annoying. No firmware upodates available. Very disappointed."
1,"Wireless extremely slow (unusable), drops frequently","Using the wired ethernet connection it's very fast, ping times are 1 ms. But the point of buying a wireless unit is to not have to use cables.Using it wireless, the ping times average in the range of 150-200 ms, with highs in the 300's, even sitting 5 feet from the unit. Pages are extremly slow to load or won't load at all.The wireless connection drops frequently when there is more than one pc on the network.If you enter an administrator password more than 8 characters, the unit hangs and you have to do a hard reset, losing all your settings. (undocumented ""feature"")Previous wireless units I've used on my old DSL setup were fine. (Linksys wrt54g, Diamond dsl642wlg, even an old NetWave Base G4). This latest piece of hardware I bought (Linksys wcg200) to make the conversion from dsl to cable isn't usable in a wireless setting."
4,Good Things Thus Far,"There are two things I really like about this so far:1. The Web-based Admin page has a MODEM LOG which actually tells you what it's having problems connecting. We've had a few connection issues with Comcast (Comcrap?) and about 5 minutes ago I lost internet connectivity and checked the modem log. Lo and behold, at the top it read:2006-12-03 10:59:59 critical No UCD's Received - TimeoutHeck if I know what that actually means, but I checked the Connection tab which mentioned the modem was ""In Progress"" for connecting and the Gateway status tab said ""Network Access Denied"". Anyhoo this made me think that perhaps Comcast has let that particular connection go dead. So I power-cycled my Linksys which brings me to #2 ...2. On/Off Switch! Holy crap, I didn't think they put these on wireless-anything anymore. My last two wireless routers had no such thing, so power-cycling involved unplugging their lifeline."
1,Understarred Review,The Linksys Cable Gateway is actually a 5 star product. I bought it to replace a failing unit. I give it one star ONLY because SkyBox - the Amazon merchant that I bought it from - advertised it as 'NEW' but it is a refurbished item. Can recommend the product but avoid the retailer.
1,Do not buy if you plan to use wireless,"This product is a piece of junk. I've had it for over a month and had nothing but problems with wireless connection. Wireless keeps dropping when viewing videos or downloading files. There is obviously an issue with the device. I talked to linksys support and they're saying to have my ISP upgrade DOCSIS (software)... that should fix the issue, they say. Talked to my ISP and they they don't do DOCSIS upgrades. The unit cannot be upgraded by end-user, so I am stuck with a defective unit.If you browse linksys forums, you'll notice tons of similar reports and disappointed users. Do not get this if you plan to use wireless -- I'll give you mine for free :-)"
5,Excellent Service,"I've owned a WCG200 for more than three years. This cable gateway has operated flawlessly! It is stable, provides great d/l speed, and the wireless covers the entire house (2500 ft, two story) and my deck. I could not be happier."
2,mediocre modem,"We use this as just a modem for now with a wired connection, and it needs frequent reboots."
5,Linksys ECG200 review,"Excellent product. easy to install, works perfectly, combines a modem and router so one less device needed. I am very pleased with it, just bought another one for the office in addition to the one i have at home."
2,Not up to the standard expected,"This two-in-one combo unit was one of the few models that Cox HSI supported, which I thought would perfectly work well and save money. But after a few weeks of testing, this unit appears to have unreliable connection issues. It randomly resets then restarts, which explained by a Cox technician ""known router issue"". The configurations are standard linksys config, easy to access. The range was also pretty good. But if you're looking for a reliable modem, go for the Surfboard from motorola or a 2-piece set instead of this combo unit."
1,Very Flawed,Has to be reset 2 to 3 times a day on average just loses connection. Very disapointing!!
1,Best to look elsewhere.,"Bottom line: it works for an unknown amount of time, after which you will continually have to restart the unit any time you send too much data at once. Skype calls, more than 1 computer, Xbox Live, all of it. Kind of makes this gateway/router useless after a period of time. Try a different model."
1,HUGE mistake,"got this one at best buy and i was happy with it because the unit is a combination of cable modem and a wireless router in 1. bad part is that it disconnects the internet if you do simultaneous wireless connections/downloads. it has nothing to do with my internet provider. all my wired devices can download multiple files without disconnecting. it is when i connect my pc via the wifi that the internet connection is being disconnected. I even tried downloading just 2 podcasts simultaneously and then the internet goes down and you have to power cycle the modem.so, if i were you, i would not even try it. oh yes, it will be good for 30 days. but after that, i wish you good luck. hehehe"
1,Terrible,"Do NOT buy this. The connection needs to be re-set constantly. I can't even watch a 2-minute YouTube video without having the connection die. It is SO frustrating. It makes me so angry that a company would put out a piece of junk like this and then sell it for so much. I will never buy a Linksys product again after my experience with this product. Seriously, do not buy this."
1,WCG200 nightmare,"My WCG200 has never been able to keep an Internet connection via wireless.This seems to be a problem with a large percentage of the units shipped, judging from the complaints on the Linksys help boards and here on Amazon. I don't know why this product hasn't been recalled.Do not. I repeat, do not, buy this product."
1,Do not buy this modem,"This product fails when you send any large amounts of infomation through it with certian isps. ""Google"" it. Unlike every other router by linksys you can not update the firmware. Your isp is suposed to do that, but ISP's like charter do not provide this service."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!,"I'v actually had this a little over a year. Last week it just quit.If mine was the only one that died, I probably wouldn't have a problem.My son had the same one and his also quit. I have another son that worksat Radio Shack and they had a customer bring one back because his quit.This seems to be a trend with these devices. I can't speak for anyone else,but if I spend that kind of money on something, I expect it to last morethat a year and a half.Sorry guys.. Three strikes and you're out."
1,Terrible reliability,"This router/modem is complete garbage.The router frequently reboots itself spontaneously, causing you to intermittenly lose network connectivity.This is a replacement for the last WCG200, which I returned because it did the same thing. This last one, however, would also lock up entirely, requiring you to power cycle it.The spontaneous reboot issue seems to be load based, opening multiple pages or graphics intensive pages seems to trigger it. (I work in an enterprise datacenter, and can't IMAGINE that a device has trouble handling such small loads.) I have contacted Linksys technical support about it a couple of times, and they were remarkably unhelpful, suggesting that I may have recieved not one, but two bad routers, and should exchange them at the store I purchased them from.I do NOT reccomend this product."
1,Old and out of warranty at purchase,"This modem didn't work. When we called for customer support, Linksys told us that the modem was out of warranty and that we had to buy a new warranty for them to help us. Pretty crappy for a brand new modem that doesn't say out of warranty. DON'T GET THIS. Waste of money, over $20 in shipping fees between both directions."
3,"Still competent for gentle use, but outdated","This product did its job well for several years after I bought it five or six years ago. Now it seems to be choking when pushed by the many additional devices and applications I'm throwing at it. Which is to be expected, as it was designed before most of them existed. It will probably be serviceable for a few more years if treated gingerly, but I'd still advise anyone to spend the extra 30% or whatever and get a device that isn't on the verge of becoming obsolete. Go for DOCSIS 3.0, gigabit Ethernet, Wireless N, et cetera and you'll probably be set for another five or six years. But that's like, just my opinion, man."
2,"All in one is nice, but this one has problems","I have the WCG200 ver 2 and it frequently freezes (requiring me to power it off and back on again), or restarts itself. This happens about 2 or 3 times a day and is extremely frustrating. At this time there is no firmware update available from the Linksys website.I like the idea of a cable modem and wireless router in one package, but the WCG200 is too buggy right now. I'm going to replace it with separates from another brand, but I'll hold onto it and see if a firmware update comes out in the future to fix this problem."
1,WCG200 - stay away from this,I have had exactly the same problems with this unit that everyone else is describing: wireless signal drops several times a day during use. At first I thought it was my cable provider but coincidentally my brother bought the same unit and he runs into the same problems. Linksys could not be more unhelpful about it either.Avoid like the plague.
2,Constantly Drops Connection,"I've owned this for about a year now. Initially it kept dropping the connection & I thought it was an issue with my cable provider. I have since moved, and have the same issue. After reading the other reviews on this item, I wish I never purchased it."
4,A good product.,"I've always been happy with Linksys products. Easy to configure. Not always my first choice,(as I buy a lot of networking products for business) but if Linksys fits into your budget it will work for you."
2,Did not work out.,"Purchased this item because it had two things rolled in one: a router and a cable modem. Turns out the router couldn't work with Cox Cable's internet (not sure why). It was a manufacturer/product issue. The thing could not hold a signal if the demand on it was too great (video, music streams) and a manual reset was necessary. The reset was inconvenient and became intolerable very quickly. Overall, I'd say this product is not worth the trouble. Spend a little more money elsewhere on something not made by Linksys!"
1,corrupt firmware,I bought this new and couldn't even set it up because there was some stuff missing from the firmware. The people I bought it from didn't even ask me to send it back and still gave me a refund.
4,great product from cisco,"This is a great product. Initially i bought airport express from apple and it worked for normal browsing and did not work fro VPN. I tried all my best to make it work with that but no luck, my friend suggested me this, this is unix based and really solid product in wirless modem category and works for all my needs.Strongly recommended this product."
2,Does Linksys even look at these reviews,"I have recently purchased one of these items without seeing the reviews. Wola, getting online with charter was not a problem, but dropping signals and rebooting twice within an hour seems to be part of owning this item. Other reviewers have put in ton more information that I can ever provide, but would not recommend spending the hard earned cash on this unit."
3,"Decent router/modem, but sometimes drops connection","This product serves its purpose. It's not out of this world, but usable. The real negative is it drops unexpectedly every now and then, but I find if I turn it off and back on once a day or so, it helps. Range is decent for the price. Easy to setup and enable some security to prevent my neighbors from ""borrowing"" my wireless connection."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this Linksys to replace an old one which I had.However,I was never able to get it to work,even with the help of a Comcast technician.For now,I'm sticking with the original one."
2,Problematic,The wireless interface on this unit mysteriously flakes out and requires a power cycle to fix. Most annoying router ever.
2,"Works as a modem, but that's it","This is a good product for those who only want to access the internet. However, those wanting to run a server will have to look elsewhere. No matter what you do, DMZ and Port Forwarding will NOT work, even after disabling all the firewall and services on the router and computer. You can't upgrade the firmware either. Now all I have is a real expensive brick after having to buy yet another router and modem."
3,Lysksis Wireless G Cable Gateway,"This product was listed as ""New"" on Amazon's website, but when I received it it had a sticker that it was refurbished. See my previously sent E Mail re this. So far the product has worked ok, but I am wondering how long this will last being that it is refurbished. You need to correct your website for this error.Ralph Jedda"
4,The Bridegroom's Vow by Rebecca Winters (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:Dimitrios Pandakis has vowed that, unlike his older brother, he will never be trapped into marriage. And this millionaire businessman has been so true to his word that -- despite his reputation as a heartbreaker -- he has yet to take a woman to bed! But now his new secretary is sorely testing his resolve. Alexandra Hamilton, for all her plain-Jane appearance, has somehow worked her way under his skin. And Dimitrios knows only one thing will satisfy him -- marriage!"
3,bad english,If you listen it's not totally off key its just that their english is way off and you can't really understand the vocals which is a shame because the lyrics are excellent. If yoy listen to their last two dics you will understand. I gave three stars for the music. The rest of the band sounds very good.
3,"a reverse ""grower""","here's what i said then: ""the album that's gonna make me have to change my year-end best of list...this guy puts out three albums a year it seems like, all under different names...this time he's simply gone with his own name. great rootsy record, it'll make my top five.""in retrospect, this album's second half kills it. the first six songs or so are great, but the momentum dies long before the album's over. don't get me wrong, i'm a huge joe pernice fan, as far back as the scud mountain boys' first albums, but this isn't his best work. it plays like a good solid EP with a few throwaway bonus tracks."
2,Second Straight Disappointment,"After overwhelming listeners with the extraordinary Overcome of Happiness, Joe Pernice disappoints again with his second post-Happiness release (the last being his other ""solo"" effort, the sleep-inducing Chapaquiddick Skyline). While some of the great Scud Montain/Pernice Brothers ambiance peeks its head occasionally, the melodies here simply don't measure up to his best work.In Joe Pernice's defense, recent interviews suggest these efforts were more one-off sabbaticals, not intended as pure Pernice Brothers' follow-ups. Here's hoping World Won't End bears this out. Otherwise, Joe and his enormous but unrealized potential will bring back memories of those unlistenable Crash Test Dummies CDs that followed God Shuffled His Feet."
1,"wrong group, wrong music",This is not the group Hypnosis nor is it the right type of music. Hypnosis was a 80's electronic/new wave band and this CD is of metal rock. I'm not sure why Amazon has samples from the group Hypnosis tagged with the group Hypnos but if you are looking for the group Hypnosis forget about this being them. If I could have reviewed this with zero stars I would have done so.
5,Classic Christmas,"This is songbook is what Christmas is all about, It contains about every traditional and classic Christmas song that I remember as child growing up. It brings back great memories."
5,Bringing back the memories...,"I can't believe they still print this book! My family has had it since probably the mid-80's, and I have been playing out of it ever since I could read music (about age 6). It has always been a joy. The music is definitely for experienced pianists, but be sure and read the ""stories behind the songs"" at the beginning of each section for some fascinating insight into your favorite Christmas songs. This book is a definite must for those who love playing and singing Christmas music."
3,Not what I expected,"The book was delivered quickly and so I would rate the seller with high marks. However, I had this book before and it was stolen. Apparently I had an earlier publication because the songs are different. This one has more contemporary songs and I don't like it very much. However, I got what I ordered, and it was delivered timely. But the contents aren't what I expected."
2,This was NUN good.,The dress was cheaply made. The hat required many extras to even make it wearable. This product was not even worth a third of what was charged.
1,DVD was defective!,"I purchased this DVD for a film class and the DVD was defective. Thirty minutes into the film, it stopped and would not play. I tried the DVD on several devices and it was defective. Disappointed!!!"
5,Beautiful and Epic,"This is the crowning achievement of moviemaking for 1978 atleast, and one of the best films of the Seventies. The scenes in the POW camp are amazing and haunting. Cimino is a little-heard-of director but he sure proved himself in this film."
1,Dull & Boring,The Deer Hunter was awarded the Best Picture that should have gone to Apocalypse Now the next year. Very long with dull scenes that have nearly no actual truth to Vietnam. Boring script and acting make this one a pitiful three hour piece of trash.
1,The emperor has no clothes,"Here is one of those ""classics"" that everyone is afraid of saying anything bad about. This movie doesn't for one second belong in AFI's Top 100. It is overly long (right at 3 hours) and is only compelling for a few minutes of the 180 long ones the viewer must endure. It takes an almost an hour and a half to get from PA. to Vietnam. Yes we meet the characters but do we really need to spend so much time learning who they are. The wedding scene last longer than some weddings I have been to in real life. And I'm sorry, they could not have picked a more disturbing theme on which to base a movie. Yet just because it is disturbing, does not mean it can support a 3 hour movie. Boring."
1,Deer Hunter,"I received the video and it doesn't play in my HD DVD player. The disc keeps generating an disc read error and it says ""this is not an HD DVD disc"" and fails to run."
3,"Great movie, poor DVD quality","Another classic film not given the attention it deserves in the DVD transfer. Sound quality is extremely poor, almost inaudible at times. Picture quality is fair."
2,"Some great performances, but otherwise a tedious movie","This film is at least an hour too long. It's also one of the most overrated movies I've experienced. Why does Cimino spend so much set-up time in Pennsylvania? The wedding is quite unremarkable, and maybe that's worth telling us, but there must be far more concise ways of achieving that objective.And in what sense is this a realistic war movie? Of the 176 minutes of this movie, fewer than five are spent on scenes which have anything to do with combat or the wartime existence of the soldier. And of the thousands of Americans who went to Vietnam, how many were forced to play russian roulette? This film does not depict the Vietnamese people well.That said, there is some great acting here, particularly in the most traumatic sequences. The roulette sequences have stayed with me ever since I first saw them back in '78 or '79, but frankly the movie has not improved over the years. I suspect my copy of the DVD will gather dust. Sorry."
2,"Ordered this item new, got it used","I ordered this item as a new dvd. It was a gift. When the recipient received it, it was scratched up and used. What a disappointment."
5,YOu can never go back home,"The Deer Hunter home scenes was filmed were I have worked for the last 35years,Mingo Jct, Ohio.I even tried out for an extra in the movie.I remember coming out of work,and smelling fall,and it was the begining of summer.There were leaves everywere down town Mingo,and there's not a single tree on the block. I saw Meryl Streep walking out of one of the stores,and didn't even know who she was.This was one of her first big films.My older girl cousin,Stella,who is 6 foot tall walked into De Niro's trailer and asked for an autograph.He told her to ""Get the hell out""but she wouldn't back down,and told her ""if it wasn't for people like us,you'd be no one.""I still enjoy this film,and still think John Savage was the greatest actor in his time.You can tell this movie had alot of Metod acting,and sometimes its over done,but ""The Deer Hunter"" is a classic.{A guy I work with in the Steel Mill,Denny Anderson,who served in Vietnam ,still loves to watch this film }"
5,the deer hunter - real art,"excellent film (disc?). russian roulette wasn't part of the Vietnam scene,but it was probably as close as you can get to THE RIGHT STUFF. good stuff on family and culture, which is almost completely gone now. wonder if the current generation would even relate to it at all?"
4,The Deer Hunter,"It's an emotional movie about the Vietnam War, that speaks the truth of what war Veterans go through after the War!"
4,Well-filmed but Slow,"Nice cinematography and scenery, there is some gorgeous, haunting natural scenery during the deer hunting sequences. The portrayal of a group of rowdy raucous steel-workers in a Russian part of town does seem to go on and on (and on) and wasn't sure I completely bought their friendship. There's only so much machismo I can stand as well. As for the Viet Nam scenes, don't know if they bore a lot of historical accuracy, but they get the point across (on lack of value for human life). Good movie for those with an interest in Cimino's work or the work of Deniro and company though personally I found it kind of boring and depressing - subject matter being what it was. I wouldn't watch it again - I'm thinking it won all those awards mostly because of the social significance and the time it was made. Overall I think this is a somewhat overrated film. You couldn't call it bad, but then again, it didn't really move me."
4,Life after war,Watch this movie if only to get to the dramatic ending which is simple yet emotionally draining. Small town boys with smaller futures go into war and the response of their families and friends to how it affected them is compelling. The film proves that you can never go home. The devastating affect of combat on these soldiers changes them and the people around them forever. Quite graphic but not unnecessarily so.
5,the deer hunter,"this is the twin of ""once upon a time in america"" a soul moving epic of the kind of ""webs we weave""don""t miss these two films!!"
4,Great Performances,"Excellent performances by Streep, De Niro, and Walken. It's a long (3 hours) and slow movie, but well worth the time. You can't go wrong with a Academy Award Winning movie for Best Picture. The russian roulette scenes are by far one of the most intense and memorable moments in cinema history."
5,Love it!,"In one scene, this movie took me from sheer terror to sheer ecstacy. I got up and shook my fists in joy when DeNiro turned the game of Russian roullete on those commie jerks. I also cried like a baby at the end. It was the second biggest tear-jerker of my life."
3,In a way... i haven't seen this film yet,"I haven't seen this film... but i like the reviewer that talked about Casino instead of The Deer Hunter... i gave this 3 stars, cause its average... i did see the film, but i was too dumb at the time to understand it, so i will see it again and probably change my rating... looks good though."
5,Amazing,"What an impressive film this and the blu ray does it full justice.Having seen The Deer Hunter many years ago I had forgotten how powerful and disturbing a film it is.The performances are outstanding and despite some rather over-long initial sequences ( the wedding being just that bit too self-indulgent) ultimately the director has consummate control of his subject matter and delivers a truly fine work of art.The image is now better than it has ever been and the sound too - what ""imperfections"" that are apparent are the really the director's intention in the main.I cannot rate this product too highly."
1,Clipping my toenails was more entertaining!,"Oh my, where do we start! One long and tedious film. Who wrote the script? It seems to me all actors were just ad-libbing their lines. Don't even ask me how itwon best picture. Was 1978 that bad of a year for movies? This film is only for die hards of De Niro or strange war films."
1,Possibly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.,"Wow. After hearing all the praise this movie has gotten and it's great cast, I figured this would definitely be a good watch. After just a half hour of the movie, I became so bored I really wanted to turn it off. I didn't however, and kept the movie running. During the next 2 1/2 hours I was baffled at what people saw in this snooze-fest. It's a horrible movie. Beyond horrible! This couldn't keep you interested no matter what happened. It just drags and drags and drags. A couple war scenes are slightly entertaining, but besides that it totally sucks. In closing, do not judge a book by it's cover. Just because De Niro is in this do not think it will be good. This is probably the most overrated and boring movie I've ever seen. Steer clear of this unless you like wasting your time."
1,Yawn,"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..............The critical acclaim of the Deer Hunter once again proves the common wisdom that if you produce an utterly boring movie, devoid of plot or substance the artsy crowd will fill it with imaginary attributes. In a nutshell this movie is zzzzzzzz.......... There was nothing in it anywhere that relates to my experiences in Vietnam or its aftermath, nor any relation to the lives of other vets I know. If you think it's art, fine. But don't think it has anything to do with the real Vietnam War. Chop it to 90 minutes and it might become watchable. Deer Hunter most resembles one of those Italian or French films where actors stare into spce for 5 minutes of dead screen time."
3,Now this one's hunting somebody down.....,"The Deer Hunter, by Michael Cimino was praised by the critics and it also was named for the best picture of the year. I personally think it was an alright movie. But some parts must have been cut.The first wedding scene was so long that ordinary movie maniacs couldn't stand the half of this film. Of course Cimino wanted to symobolize some dark parts of the movie.But there were pretty lots of scenes that should have been cut.But after that wedding part, all we can see is the shocking truth that we could've seen in the 60's-70's in America. The acting was very good, and the symbolizing things were great.THAT THING was a good thing for Cimino to do. My favorite part in this movie was the last scene. When the people sing 'God Bless America'. Because Cimino actually wanted to say god f@#$ America! I would give it 3 out of five."
5,Best Vietnam movie ever made,"One of my all time favorite movies. Incredible story, amazing acting - especially Deniro and Walken (Deniro was robbed of the best actor award if you ask me, although Jon Voight was great in Coming Home too). Can't wait to see the deleted scenes and extended scenes. The slapping and hitting, by the way, is real during the Russian Roulette scene at the POW camp. DeNiro wanted them to really hit him so he get more emotionally involved in the scene. Amazing! Great movie and a must see. It's on AFI's top 100 movies of all time for a good reason."
2,Good But Too Long!,"I just couldn't get into this because of the length. As noted dozens of times, the wedding scene was just ridiculously long. My other problem was that the movie didn't flow... it just jumped from scene to scene leaving the viewer wondering what just happened. I'm glad I finally saw this, but what a waste of time."
1,where is the Cimino commentary? UK only?,"...so this is available in the UK (I purchased an import) with a commentary by Michael Cimino..in the US we get the cinematographer?he IS a great cameraman but why is the director commentary not included domestically? The second disc in the UK has an interview with the ever-strange director as well as with theaformentioned Vilmos Zigmond and actor John Savage! It really puts this ""special edition"" to shame!the US edition the LEGACY edition..has 16 minutes of deleted/extended scenes in poor condition with no commentary and the trailer on the 2nd disc...what a scam! There is no need for a second dis for such ...nothing! The UK edition has sooo much more to offer....I'm thrilled to own it and enjoy a true SPECIAL edition...send Universal a message and boycott this."
3,"Good, but overrated","This movie unfortunately could not live up to its reputation. The cast is very strong, but the story falls apart toward the end. Other reviews have outlined the plot, so I won't rehash it here. The film is divided into three acts. The first one is too long, the second is too short, and the third leaves too many questions unanswered. I think this movie had the potential to be the greatest war movie ever made. It is a must-see for DeNiro fans, and Christopher Walken is excellent. Other than that, I was disappointed."
2,A geographical horror,"Nobody will like this review because it treats a great movie with a certain criticism: that Pennsylvania should never have been transformed into Switzerland or Montana or New Zealand.The magnificence of the ""pennsylvania"" countryside truly detracts from the movie's power by offering a more magnificent landscape than the story's reality. The real Pennsylvania, or its likeness, would have sufficed to give the viewer a moderate view of the characters' background rather than suggesting that they evolved from geographical grandeur into snivelling consciousness."
1,totally unbelivable and unintresting,"THis film hardly does justice to vetrans of the Vietnam war becaues it exploits what happend to them and then plays it in complety unrealistic ways( I know becaues my father is one) Above from the story unrealistic tones, the film is hardly intresting in any cinematic terms. Every scene is draged out way to long and every charter is carboard or worse. THe film musical score is equally hokey. The film also is done in by weak writing and genrally bad acting. ( espacilly di nero which is shocking) Wlakens ok but nothing speical. The story telling is badly disjointed and tells a secen from one to many angles. Any one who claimed they went throught a similar story has bowed to waht the media thinks hapend in vietnam. I"
2,What was the point of the movie?,"I found this movie somewhat engrossing but I guess I must be stupid or ignorant because I fail to see what point the movie made. During its three hour running time, all it did was crosscut between a wedding, a deer hunt, and playing Russian roulette and the audience, presumably had to guess the point, if any."
1,very strange and twisted,"I usually don't give reviews like this but here goes. This film $ucks! I am a De Niro fan, but not this film. It is very strange and twisted. It is not an action film. This is not a love story. This is not a fun movie. There is no good scenery. I don't consider it a thinking film. Any film where the primary characters play Russian rullet is not a thinking film."
1,Mindless drinking to mindless killing,"The wedding scene. What's with the hour long wedding scene that goes nowhere? My time is worth more than listening to a senseless script. Maybe the plan was to show senseless American life of roughhousing, drinking and merrymaking next to senseless burning alive Vietnamese? If that's the point than I find this movie lacking.I can get that hollywood thinks that American's are a bunch of rednecks in under a five minute scene. There is no need to paint a degrading and mindless hour long intro picture of the brave men and women that make up the vast majority of this country as being rediculous drunks.how is this an Oscar winning movie?"
1,I'll keep this simple...,"This is definitely one of, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. It is horrible."
5,Definitly a masterpiece!!!!!,Its one of the most depressing and best stories I have ever seen.The movie shows how life is if you go through a frighting war.It was so depressing that I was cring in most of the movie.It is a story of a man who loves to deer hunt (robert deniro)and his friend just got married and the other is getting married and then they get drafted into a terrible war.Deniro returs saftly and his friend didn't come back but was still alive (chistifer walken) and the other who got married lost his legs.Deniro goes back to look for him and when he finds him his life is based on russian ruleit.the war messed up his mind and he didn't know who he was.He ends up playing the game with deniro and walken looses and dies.At the end you are left with a very sad feeling in you.
4,Emotional,"Stunning, but depressing, depiction of before, during, and after Vietnam with the main characters being a group of steel mill working buddies who live for drinking it away at a local bar after work. Outstanding performances, particularly by De Niro, Walken, and Savage. A bit overlong, but overall an outstanding motion picture. The last scene is very tearjerking."
1,HD DVD Not Any Better Than Standard Version,The Deer Hunter (Universal Legacy Series) is just as good as the HD DVD version. After watching both back and forth at the same time I could not see any difference on my Sony KDS 50A2020 in 1080p. My review is for the HD Quality and not the 5 Star Movie.
1,Sappy Sewage,"Look, I was in 'Nam and this movie captures nothing but a few tears from weepy card burning hippies who used to throw eggs on us back in the day. This film naively chose to focus on the sad aspects of war, like watching your buddy go crazy. It neglected to display the great aspects of war, like you and your buddy being able to legally kill people. I mean, you can call me crazy, but until you've actually been in that position you don't know how exhilirating it is. This movie is unrealistic, melodramatic, and highly overrated."
1,Skip it,"I nearly fell asleep three times in the first hour alone. The last thirty minutes was a contrived joke and I hardly understand why it's called The Deer Hunter-should be plural. I like Deniro, Streep, and Walken but this movie is pretentious and boring."
1,Warning about buying HD DVD movie,This came nicely in original packaging however does not work in the DVD or blueray player.
3,great vietnam sequence but too slow to start,"The Deer Hunter does have its moments but its hard work getting too them. The first part of the movie, the wedding, is tedious, and really does drag on for ever. The Vietnam sequence and the remainder of the movie are far better, but its a bit of a mixed bag overall, and there are better films dealing with the period.DeNiro and Walken are on good form."
4,HD transfer acceptable,"I collect classic movies only and bought all nine available in HD. Warner discs (The Searchers, Casablanca, Mutiny on the Bounty, Forbidden Planet, Grand Prix, The Dirty Dozen, Robin Hood (1938)) generally have better picture quality than Universal (Spartacus, The Deer Hunter). The picture quality of this one is acceptable, especially if you compare it to Spartacus. But, The Searchers is absolutely the most brilliant in picture quality and that proves how beautifully HD can be produced. Let's wait for the next releases."
5,Citizen Kane of our time,"I see there are a lot of experts contributing here. If you look at the symbolism of ""The Deer Hunter"", you'll realize the importance of this film. Never mind the ""that couldn't happen"" crap; pay attention to the story."
2,Great Movie...Bad Film Transfer,"I really , really like this movie. The movie itself gets 5 stars, but I have to say this DVD version, is extremely inferior. The picture quality is used VHS caliber, and the sound is as shabby. A film of this magnitude, one which won acouple of Academy Awards and was nominated for a few more. (Itwon for Best Picture) should have been done a lot better. I would hold out for a remastered version and express those feelings to the studio.UPDATE: The pictured version of this DVD, is not the one I originally reviewed..it has been remastered and updated and is now worthy of 5 Stars as it should be."
5,A good film about America and friends,"From the parts of the movie I have seen in different entertainment stories, I thought the movie was primarily a film about the war in Vietnam. It does cover the war, but it covers the effects of the war on people and communities; very little of the film takes place in Vietnam.The bulk of the movie takes place in Pennsylvania where we see the friends going through bonding and anticipation as they prepare to leave for the war. After the war, we see how they bring parts of the war back with them and how some can't leave it behind.Christopher Walken and Robert DeNiro give great performances. The change in Walken's character is very noticeable and well portrayed by him. The change in DeNiro's character is much subtler.I would highly recommend seeing this film."
3,A magnificient story of friendship,"In Europe, when this film was released, it created a scandal. Some critics wrote it was a racist movie, others that it was a western which takes place during the Viet-Nm war. Forget all of that. Above all, it is about a beautiful and moving friendship between two friends, in the purest American tradition. Nevertheless, I did not enjoy it as much as Apocalypse now because the period is not described accurately enough for me."
3,From awful to classic,The first hour and a half of this film is rediculously boring and long. It all revolves around some friends going off to war and one of them is getting married. The whole wedding seen goes on and on and on and on and on........It seems endless.All of a sudden the friends are in Vietnam and are captured by the Viet Cong and forced to play Russian Roulette with eatch other. Than they escape and the rest of the film deals with the aftermath of what they went through. This whole part is wonderful. Its a shame they couldn't edit it a little bit at the begining.Great acting from DeNiro and Walken. All the other performances are just ok. Worth watching once but I don't think I could sit through the begining again.
2,Don't quite see the appeal,"This movie is loved by so many. But I personally was never able to connect to it. I felt it was a bit too ""hollywood."" The grit never made it through a certain dated sheen. But I did, however, really enjoy the beginning Steel Belt portion of the film ... a real sense of ethnic heritage, class portrait, and a specific if unremarkable moment in US cultural history. That to me was actually more captivating than the main Vietnam portion."
3,You have to be in the mood to see this one,"This is an alright film, something worthwhile, but if you wanna see a war film that you are expecting to be a 23 year old Saving Private Ryan, skip it. However, if you want to see a long, slow-paced, but intresting film about an industrial Pennisylvania town adjusting to the Vietnam war, see it."
5,"A Powerful, Wrenching War-Drama Film!","This is easily among the best movie of all time. this is a powerful piece of film-making and a rare treat: a 'war' movie with nostalgia. Great performances all around, but especially DeNiro and Walken. While 3 hours long it is never boring, it shows you what's happening before, during and after the Vietnam War, in a small Pennsylvania town. It also shows you what happens to men after a war and the impact it leaves in their personalities. Great direction by Cimino, and a low-key score make it enjoyable. A must-see, one of the greats. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10!"
4,"Some holes in the plot, but very good nonetheless.","There were gaps in this story wide enough to fly a helicopter through, and that distracted me a little. I know the film was more a metaphor on courage and friendship than an actual story, and it worked very well on that level. The ending was especially powerful. Don't see this if you insist on taking everything literally though. It doesn't work that way."
4,"A Unforgettable Emontial Journey Of Love, War, & Friendship","The Deer Hunter is one of those unconvential war films like Apocalypse Now or Born On The Fourth Of July that deals with the emontial hardships of the war and it's effects on the soldiers in the war. This is a very long, but fast moving film that deals with the hardships of war and the pains of the men who were lucky enough to come back alive. Robert De Niro gives a earth shattering performance that I think he borrows from his character in Taxi Driver. The Russian Roullete scene visually describes the terrors of Vietnam and shows what hell is. This movie is definitley not the best Vietnam War film, but it is the best film about friemdship and love during the turmoil."
1,Not as advertised,"Poor quality renditions of each song. ""Burning Bridges"" isn't even the right version of the song that was used in the movie. Don't waste your money as it isn't even worth 5 bucks."
3,Another Missa for non-choral singers,"The Monteverdi group is technically perfect but 36 people is not enough to give good emotion to this piece, regardless of how close you put the microphones to them. To put it lightly, even if this is religious music you should NOT do it with a chamber music sized group. The power of the the singing isn't there regardless of how technically perfect the singing is, and it is very good. You can get away with it in the Benedictus and the Kyrie but the size of the group really detracts in the powerhouse Gloria and Credo.As a choral singer who has performed this piece and has been looking for years to find a quality recording with a truly great choir, you better look elsewhere."
4,"Compact, classy, easy to use","I have been very impressed with this digital camera. It is compact, yet feels ""weighty"" or substantial in your hands.I appreciate that the battery has a long life and only requires charging about every 300 shots. However, I wish that it were not necessary to remove the battery to recharge.The large screen is ideal for picture set up."
5,one of the best of its kind,"I've had other 3 digital cameras and this is the best I think, I shots very quick, flash is brighty, and even soft flash for more natural shots.can browse pictures very fast and is has a lot of posibilities to edit inside the camera, is light tiny and slim.one of the best cameras.I don't find a negative feature on it. I love it."
4,Looks Great and User Friendly.,"Very happy with it, but this is my first proper digital camera so what do I know! Have very little photographic experience so just wanted a 'point and press' kind of camera. Was attracted by the looks, and it is gorgeous, but have also been pleased that it's easy to use, small enough to fit in my pocket/bag, and the viewing screen is still a great size. You need to buy a case for it though as any fingerprints and scratches show up."
5,Wonderful Product!,"This camera is multipule years old at this point, so I've had plenty of time to use it. That being said, it was already my THIRD Exilim camera. I would not buy a different brand, every one I've had has been wonderful.My favorite thing about this camera (and all Exilim's that I've owned) is the rechargeable battery. I fail to understand why cameras are still sold that require standard AA battery's. You could end up saving yourself hundreds of dollars just on battery's over the life of this camera.Also, the cradle comes with the camera, unlike some that make you purchase it separately.The camera is very rugged, and will withstand your ""oops"" moments--mine has hit the concrete multiple times and still works great.The size is also very nice. You can put it in your pocket, and forget it's even there.I realize that at the time I am writing this review there are newer cameras with more megapixel's, but take my word for it--this product still has plenty of camera!"
4,Inexpensive anywhere camera,"Don't expect stunning photos from this camera. It does have a great looking screen, AMAZING video capabilities, and a size that makes you want to take it everywhere. Good for 3x5 prints and for students putting images in facebook and whatnot."
2,Deffective Battery,"the battery that came with it does not workthis could just that I'm plain out of luck, but it won't charge and needs to be replaced. Since I am in Brazil, this involves going to reseller that's out of my city and waiting for a few weeks before I can start using it.Bleh!"
1,Go for the newer & better model,If you want a nice camera similar to this one...go for the Z600 it has better features and the overall look of the camera is much better than the z60. ive seen both..and the Z600 is alot more attractive.
1,Piece of junk and horrible service!,"This is my second camera and shame on me for giving Casio a second chance. The ""customer service"" was horrible, rude and not helpful at all. I have had several camera's in my professional life and have to say that I will never buy this brand again after the way I was treated!"
4,"Good camera, bad battery life.",Had this camera for about 6 yrs. Just died on me...lens error. Has been a good camera...nice features and not too difficult to use. Downside is batteries do not stay charged for very long. I've also heard that a lot of cameras are rechargeable by plugging it in...you have to remove the battery for this one and put it in a separate charger.Still a decent camera.
1,Blurry Pictures,"This camera doesn't feature image stabilization, so close ups are very blurry. I'm very dissappointed."
3,not bad for the price,"as with most point n shoot cameras, it takes a few tries before you get a good picture"
4,Looks are more important.,"This camera is definately a eye-grabber.It's skinny, pretty , and black, which makes it look even slicker. The screen is big and viibrant. And it's fairly easy to use. Unfortunately the pics aren't the best . I previously owned a canon a520, and i believe it took better pics than those of of the z60. NJot a hugte difference, but you can tell. Which is kinda a down-er considering the 4.0-vs.-6.0 Mp difference.Other than that the camer is a good choice especially if you want a camera mainy to take snap-shots. :-D"
1,Poor Quality,"After purchasing this camera, I was rather disappointed at the quality of the images after I had uploaded them on to my PC. As a result, i took it back to the shop immediately, and exchanged it for the Canon Expo 4MP equivalent in price, which I can not be happier with. It is superb."
5,Great and quick service,I bought this item as a present for my boyfriend. They shipped it within 3 days and the product was exactly as pictured. He loved it!
1,"Battery life if horrible, don't buy this camera!","This camera is a huge disappointment, the battery life is horrible, esp. after a few months of usage. I have to charge it after only a few hours of taking pictures.Also, the battery is difficult to remove the camera, which is required the charge it.I don't understand why they design the product so you have to remove the battery to charge it, why not follow the cell phone scheme where you just plug a charger into the device itself?Bottom line, this produce is a waste of money, go with a different brand."
5,Awesome,This camera is the most dudely camera ever. It is so cool and cool. Buy this camera because it loves you and needs you. I love this camera and it loves me. -Hammy
4,A Solid Buy!,"Just bought this camera. In all honesty it is a solid buy for a 6 megapixel camera. Casio is a great manufacturer, and the design is amazing considering how thin it is. Love the fact that you can get it in black or silver. Other colors too?A solid performer, great features and a nice 2.5"" screen in the back. Highly recommended."
2,Coud Be Nice if It Didn't Break Everytime You Breathe...,"I bought this camera about 7 months ago, then for some reason when I woke up one day, it didn't work. I went to the store where I purchased it and was very fortunate that they replaced it for a brand new camera. I had the replacement camera for only one month and all of a sudden the camera stopped wanting to retract and zoom properly and constantly says LENS ERROR. Now I have to ship this camera away to get it repaired. If you are looking at spending 150-200 on a camera, do not buy this one. It has decent picture quality and looks nice, but it breaks without you even knowing why or how."
2,Beautiful Form but Dissapointing Pictures,"This camera has a beautiful and comfortable form factor but it takes terrible pictures. First off, the barrel distortion at the top of the screen is so pronounced that you can see it easily of the 2.5"" LCD. Then, even with the high ISO settings, indoor pictures without flash leave a lot to be desired. Pictures were blurry without the image stabilization on, and the images lacked a lot of detail if the image stabilization is on. Honestly, my 2.5 year old Kodak DX4530 takes better indoor pictures without flash.Outside pictures are good, but still suffer from the lens distortion.After 3 days, 400 pictures, and a call to Casio, I am returning this camera. The tech support knew little more than megapixels about the camers and did not have any remedies. I plan to try the Sony W50 and hope for better indoor and optical performance."
4,"Good, but not as great as thought.","I bought these for my daughter because my boss told me about them and about how they'll help to soak up pee when she has an accident so I won't always have to change her shorts along with her undies. They are thicker than normal undies, but they don't really soak up that much more pee. A little bit more, but not a lot more. Therefore, I'm still having to change her shorts if she has an accident. They're good, but they just don't soak up as much of her pee as I thought they would have."
3,They r just panties,"I guess I was expecting these to hold pee better than ordinary undies. However, when my 18 month old has an accident it gets everywhere. I don't really feel it does any better than just plan old underwear and it's twice the price."
5,Great!,These are great. They give a little extra protection against small accidents so clothes do not get messed up. They are not waterproof so it will not protects against big accidents. I really like the fit as well. Regular panties will not stay on my daughter very well. These fit more like boy shorts so they hug her shape and stay on very well. I have nothing bad to say about these.
4,Great for infant potty training,"We are using these for part-time ""elimination communication"" with our 8 month old. He gets to spend time playing without the bulk of our cloth diapers slowing him down and if we miss his signal that he needs to pee, these pants are absorbent enough to prevent a mess. They have also been able to contain the poos that we missed. These pants are well made, serve the purpose and are comparatively inexpensive so we were able to purchase lots of pairs. We found out about these in the book entitles ""The Diaper-free Baby,"" which is a great book about infant potty training."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"We wanted to let our stubborn 3-year-old wet her pants and get uncomfortable as a way to convince her that the potty is a good thing. However, we didn't want to mop up a lot of puddles. These training pants worked perfectly. With pants on, they're just thick enough that nothing reaches the floor. (Training pants and jeans get soaked.) She can feel that she's wet and she's finally starting to make the connection between that and the potty. They're super soft and completely cover her bum. Just right!"
3,I give them a 2 because they are cute.,"Not really worth the extra price. If I am going to clean up a teetee, I'm going to clean up teetee. The amount makes no difference. I can see them holding in the alternative better because the legs are like boyshorts, but haven't had that experience yet."
3,High Priced Panties ~ Luxury Item,"I bought size 3 for my 2 year old grandaughter, fits fine-just higher in the waist. I have only bought 1 package because they are expensive... so they dont get much credit for my grandaughter being potty trained at 2 years & 4 months! When she says she needs to go potty, get up & go with her everytime, until its become a habit...being able to say the words helps alot too!"
3,Great underwear - didn't work as training pants,"For my son, these never ever held in an accident. But since he's been potty-trained, he has been wearing these as normal underwear just because we still had them. He also has some normal toddler boy undies - but he always picks these out - they are just that comfortable! The other thing is, The 18 mos size fit him when he was 14 mos old - and still do at almost 3! I mean, they are a little small, but still comfy enough. I am getting 3T since he loves them so much! I would give them 1 star as training pants - but 5 stars as undies!"
4,Do the job,I prefer these starter panties over the thin panties because of the extra lining. It buys you a little time incase of an accident. I gave these 4 stars because there still to big for my small framed daughter.
1,Don't buy from this company!!!!,"DO NOT order from the company Baby Love!!!! They took my money and didn't send the product. To this day, I have never received the training pants. I hope that Amazon took them off of their site."
2,Not impressed,"I was hoping to find something a little more absorbant than this. These hold nothing, you might as well just buy normal underwear"
5,Just what I expected!,These gerber training pants can be hard to find. The training pants were just what I expected and a competitive price.
3,Gerber training pants,"The pants are wonderfully soft. However, they are not as absorbent as I thought they'd be and aren't exactly helpful in the potty training process."
1,Have no idea,"Sorry, I can't tell you what this product is like because I never received the shipment - the seller has never responded to my inquiries - Amazon has been absolutely no help."
2,Didn't really work in our case,"These probably work for some kids but my 3 year old daughter thought they were underwear and would ask for a pull-up to go potty in. I meant to buy them so if she had an accident while wearing them she'd be able to feel the messiness. Nope, she knows the difference between these and pull-ups and has only gone in the potty once while wearing them. She actually would rather wear her underwear. Still trying to get her to go in the potty though. I need to figure out another way to out-smart her!"
2,three gorges,"I must agree that the book uses very contrived dialogue which clearly reduces the interest level. With the subject topic, this should have been a dynamic powerful book but winds up forcing the reader to continue in search of something to grab onto. it was dry, very dry, and found lacking - I picked it up because I am interested in anything relating to the Three Gorges area but I was terribly disappointed."
4,Missionary in China,"This is an honest work, constructed in a thoughtful manner. This book really gave me a feeling for a gritty two-way passage through the Dragon's Mouth in 1946. Cowles, living in China, is a wide eyed missionary in the most turbulent of times, and his perspective is very interesting. This work is highly historic, and has some beautiful pictures and illustrations which bring the work to life."
1,Another Hilarious Leftist Screed,"You mean people who choose to spend their lives in media actually have political views? Wow, what a revelation.It obviously outrages Barlow that people who defy the Canadian left's groupthink are still allowed to own newspapers in this country. But if Barlow wants to examine bias in the Canadian media, she should start on the left. Some examples she might have considered include the Atkinson family, the Liberal party apparatchiks who control the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest and dumbest newspaper. I'm sure it is mere coincidence that the paper reads like a Liberal propaganda sheet.And lest a socialist like Barlow attempt to pin the blame for this kind of bias on capitalist ownership of the media, let's not forget the CBC, Canada's government-supported broadcaster and a leading manufacturer of at least two kinds of red ink and so howlingly leftist that it has lost any semblance of credibility for reporting anything beyond hockey."
5,good enough to watch again and again,"I've watched this several times and enjoyed it.Aside from Exorcist 2, I enjoy watching all the Exorcist films over and over again"
3,Newcomer Stands Out,"While ""What's the Worst that Can Happen"" was far from the best comedy I've seen, I was very impressed by many of the supporting actors and bit players. Of particular note although somewhat overlooked by the critics was the voluptuous Sascha Knopf, who portrays the centerfold. Although the role is largely a prop, the stunning Ms Knopf handles it with grace and style and a subdued comic aptitude that tells me she will be back in other roles. Sascha is absolutely gorgeous and the fact that she can act can't help but make her more appealing!! In addition to rather large . . . ahem, assets up front, she also possesses full, voluptuous lips that are highly expressive, a striking poise that you might expect to find on a much taller actress, and big beautiful hands that are noticeable for their own unique style in many of her scenes. She is one to watch for stardom to come!"
1,was the worst movie,"Nada que ver con anteriores trabajos de Martin Lawrence, realmente un fiasco de película !!"
3,AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IT ITSELF POSES.,"Starts out with good timing, and some decent laughable banter from Martin Lawrence. Nothing laugh out loud funny but pleasantly amusing schtick. The central premise is actually quite interesting (billionaire stealing a ring from a petty robber etc), but the film fails to take advantage of it, choosing instead to lapse into numerous plot-holes, cliches and mind-bending stupidity. There's even a gay, dog-loving detective who adds fart humor to the mix. And all this leads to a climax that takes a quantum leap of logic and rationality. Perhaps a worthy rental if you're into slapstick, but overall a skippable fare."
1,Formula Martin Lawrence comedy,"Film students, listen up: the formula for a typical Martin Lawrence film goes something like this. Find a comedy script and remove anything that smacks of cleverness and genuine humor - we don't want to upstage Lawrence's own 'natural ability' to provide laughs simply by showing up and looking cross-eyed into the camera. Add to the cast a sexy black woman/love interest who in real life wouldn't give Lawrenece himself or the character he's playing the time of day. Create lots of scenes that defy any semblance of reality and let Lawrence mug his way through with half-assed imitations of Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and just about any other black comedian you can mention.Speaking of which, I can't imagine Bernie Mac actually found this script funny enough to make an appearance. Believe me, you won't either. Everyone's obviously in it for an easy paycheck. Do yourself a favor and don't encourage them any further."
2,What's up with that dective?,"Nah, I just did not like this movie. Only 2 scenes were funny. Besides, what's so funny about 2 guys trying to get 1 ring while they con everybody else???Booo.Too many distractions in the movie."
2,Supporting Roles Were Better,"I thought that both Danny DeVito and Martin Lawrence have been in better movies. I was not thrilled with the story line either, but the supporting role, played by GQ, the up and coming star, was one of the best aspects of the movie. He added some comic relief when I was on the verge of falling asleep, and his charming face made it worth staying for the rest of the movie. I cannot wait for him to be in other films. So overall, go to the movie for the smaller parts, not the main characters."
1,This movie is the worst that could happen,"The premise of the movie is this: Martin plays a thief who meets his match when a crooked billionaire(played by Danny Devito) steals his ring in a botched robbery attempt. Martin goes out of his way to get his ring back by making a fool of the billionaire.My opinion: The movie is Saturday Night Live dull. Martin as well as Danny Devito(who should have known better than to go along with this tedious movie) are not funny. The effeminate cop was hilarious and that is about all the laughs you will get out of this dumb movie. I watched it when I was visiting a cousin who stayed in Trenton, New Jersey and rued the day I was curious enough to see this wreck. The movie was about as dry as the Sahara desert and should be a shoe in for a razzie award. If this doesnt make your worst movie lists then I am at a loss for words. Have trouble sleeping? Watch this. It's litterally visual tranqulizer."
2,A dud,"This lackluster comedy simply fails to deliver sufficient laughs per hour to justify spending the time to watch it. Martin Lawrence, who is normally a funny guy, just isn't on his game in this flick. Danny DeVito is better, but the material doesn't give him much with which to work.There is a lot of talent wasted on stereotype bits that are more insulting than comical. William Fichtner's flamingly effeminate detective would only be funny to homophobes. John Leguizamo's Arab imitation is less humorous now than it might have been before September 11.The only really funny bit in the film is a strictly visual gag by Stephanie Clayman as the sign language interpreter. Without virtue of a solitary line of dialogue, she single handedly produces all the most hilarious moments in the film.This film is a dud. I rated it 3/10. Martin Lawrence fans are likely to be disappointed."
1,Not the Euro Version,This is not the Region 2 as it is say on the details.. still the US Version (Region 1) I Thought it was the other Euro Region that have different scenes in it
4,Pretty enjoyable movie,"I really liked this movie. I know it might be a bit cheesy in some parts and some people really didn't like this movie, but I did. The story was fairly entertaining, the acting decent, and some funny events and twists made this movie fun to watch as a rental."
2,Such a goodlooking DVD cover deserves a better movie.,"I bought the DVD because I like Bo Derek, and also because I liked the DVD cover. There are also some other respected actors here, like Stacy Keach and Geoffrey Lewis. Like Bo, they too do a good job, but unfortunately, the script is what kills the movie. It felt more or less incomprehencible. It would have been fun to see Bo together with these good actors in a good movie. But ""Sunstorm"" is not good. Only recommended to those who want to have a complete DVD collection of Bo Derek's or Keach's or Lewis's films."
2,Get burned by sunstorm!,"In ""Sunstorm"", the famously bodacious Bo Derek- who is now stretched,literally, as an actress- stars as an international criminal mastermind. She is the brains behind the decision to assassinate The General (Stacy Keach) The General's trio of glamorous daughters go on a globe-trotting adventure to avenge his death,as well as rescue an annoying little girl. There are explosions and fistfights aplenty. The trio of babes are bargain basement Charlie's Angels. They fight! They were bikinis and fancy dresses during fight scenes! They get conveniently rescued by the Hunky Guy! ""Sunstorm"" even has a paunchy lead who appears to be Mitchell's clone. Could he possible be Joe Don Baker's love child?""Sunstorm"" has international intrigue,a passel of bikini-clad babes,a Pakistani villain, explosions, tons of $$$,Bo Derek herself-- and a really non sequitur ending. It ends with a hot couple running down a beach to the sound of Brazilian drums. We'll always have Rio de Janeiro..."
3,Great for RBX fans!,"Don't get me wrong!...this is a good joint here, I am trying to buy his cd's in order from start to finish, but that first project (The RBX Files) was a hard act to follow! I would suggest if you are just getting into RBX, to start from his first project first then collect from there so you can appreciate him more as an artist, because his is a fire spitter for sure!.."
3,Not bad,"This CD contains two EPs, No Mercy/No Remorse and X-Factor. While all of No Mercy is good, the X-Factor's only moment is ""Make My Day"" featuring Treach of naughty by nature, the rest unimportant. The beats on the first half of the album impress, as do most of the lyrics. If you're a fan of RBX, or rap in general and you're looking for something different, check this out."
2,DISSAPOINTING,HE SOULD KEEP WRITING RYMES FOR OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE RBX AND THE WORK HE DOES WITH OTHERS BUT ON HIS OWN NOT SO GOOD
3,Much better than I thought it would be,"First of all, this is definitely not a white power album, apparently some people are too lazy to a.) look at the cover and b.) listen to a sample. Anyway....RBX in this cd is pretty good, but it seems like he had good beats for about 5 songs and then put in the rest as filler. Heatmizer, Oh No!, Out Wit Da Old and Gigolo Skalloni will probably be the only reasons you play this album more than a few times, other than that the songs trudge along somewhat. It was much better than I thought, coming from a guy who isn't really signed to a label and who got shafted when he left Death Row Records. If you like RBX a lot, I'd get the album. It's definitely a good addition to a collection. If you are looking for solid, time-tested gangsta rap, I'd look at Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre."
1,Swastikas and Hate,"Do you bother to screen the music you sell. Swastikas on the cover should give you a clue as to the content of this group's music. This is the last paragraph of an article from EFE which I read on-line from an article about how White Supremacists are using music to attract young people.""But the neo-Nazi culture has also infiltrated mainstream sales outlets such as Amazon.com, which offers 5 CDs by the group No Mercy-No Remorse, with packaging covered with swastikas and other Nazi icons. EFE"""
1,HOW?,"How can people listen to music that promotes the killing of people because of race? It promotes hate crimes, death, and destruction....how could anyone listen to this? I would give it negative stars becuase it perverts the youth of america"
3,Insert Title Here,"I usually wear a US 10 in the Adidas Superstar. The 10 in this model is a bit narrow, yet I find my foot slipping around in it. The looks and fit/finish are exactly what I wanted and expected, my only criticism centers around the fit. Unfortunately, these shoes are not comfortable to wear, and I wish I had not bought them."
3,Good for a quick pickup but not with a full sound,"This is a good cajon, not a great one. The bass tones are lacking from many others I have played. Versatility is also limited as it has but one intended playing surface... yes, of course you can play the remaining sides, too. The adjustable snare is really a nice little feature. I do use this when playing to achieve different sounds on the fly, but you would have issues trying to do it in the middle of a tune: Between songs is just easy. Finish is lovely: It looks like a fine piece of furniture in the living room. Sturdiness is wonderful. It is comfortable to sit on, and I use it as a drum throne from time to time. Microphone use: no problem: stick on in the port hole on the back, which also doubles as a crude but efficient handle."
1,Don't Bother..Save Your Money,".I bought this DVD thinking, from the description, that it was about Apollo. I thought there would be stories, histories, a mini documentary. I also believed this as the description states there is a ""director"". This DVD is none of these things. It is in actuality, a glorified power point presentation set to polka music, and marching band music. I wanted to use it for a class I was teaching, but after watching endless images of coins with supposedly Apollo's face on them...(Apollo or Caesar?) march on I decided this was just a grand and costly mistake."
2,VERY SMALL!,"this is VERY small, for the tiniest of digital cameras. It did not fit the camera that it was recommended for -- well, maybe 1/2 of it would fit in, in pieces! I've thought about sending it back, but the shipping would probably cost as much as the item did! Now I'm stuck with a case I have no use for."
2,This bag is much smaller than the dimensions given,"It's a nice enough case, but the dimensions in the description are totally wrong, as are the dimensions given on the Targus' website...they must be describing a different case. The case I received had the correct external and internal dimensions printed on the packaging (and the same item # as the description). Unfortunately, I didn't jot them down before returning, but I think I remember the approx. external dimensions: 4.1"" x 2.75"" x 1.6"". Or something like that. So double check to see if your camera will fit. The only reason I gave any stars at all was Amazon's stellar customer service. They took the bag back, refunded my money in full and paid for the return shipping, all within about a week. But, they have not changed the dimensions in the description."
1,Wrong dimensions,"The Targus website says interior dimensions are 2.8"" x 2"" X 4.6"". Actual dimensions are 2.8"" x 1.2"" x 4.6"". That is a huge difference. My camera just won't fit. What a waste."
5,Excellent Treatment,"Large (8.5 x 11) Paperback; excellent history, full of photos, several in color, of one of the most colorful, interesting Class 1 Branch Lines in American Railroading. Terrific, well-written treatment of the subject. Highly recommended."
1,Outdated,"I love these tortillas, but they are not always available at my small-town grocery.They arrived about one month out of date!!!Amazon was quick to give refund. But I would have rather had freshtortillas."
1,Waste of Money,"I saw the author on our local TV station and thought that the book would have more reasons why people feel the way they do due to past life, etc. The book was mostly common sense that our mothers taught us. It was a complete waste of my money."
2,Disappointing Unfortunately,The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart. I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims. Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF. I tried this bra on in a 38 DD. I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support. Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all. That is not the effect I want when I go strapless. Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety.
5,Great replacements,"Product is easily installed and provides quite a sharp edge. They seem to stay sharp for quite a long time. Although I'm generally protective about what I feed into the planer, the edge does get nicked and produces raised lines on the finished product. Other than that, which is probably true for all planers, great product...and when the edge does get dull, flip them around and use the second edge."
2,toning was supppose to be included,"i was very upset! I was suppose to get the toning band and i didn't? WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO EXERISE WITH A STRING I""M UPSET II didn't get what I paid for Tone and Sweat video.emma miller"
5,Fish of Souls,"If your looking for a good book to curl up with on a rainy weekend, this is it! Once I started reading, I didn't want to put it down. It's a great read and I look forward to Gary's next book!"
1,I cannot rate something that was never delivered!,"I purchased this item for my daughter, who requested a first aid Kit from Santa this Christmas. They took my money, but the item never arrived. Buyer beware!"
2,Hitch-Hike,"This CD was only in fair condition. It contained music from groups that I was not familr with, Howeve it did contain songs by the Lewallen Bros, which was what I was looking for.""The Ghost"" Tucson High Class of 57."
1,Tasteless,One of the worst pieces of gibberish I have ever heard! A waste of time for all involved! BLOW THIS OFF THEY SHOULD HAVE KEPT THIS TO THEMSELVES!
5,"Disgusting, Perverted, Just Plain Sick!!! P E R F E C T!",This album rocks!! It's about time someone made a good Christmas album. I Love it!!!
5,FRATERNITY GUYS WILL LOVE YOU FOR GIVING THEM THIS ALBUM!,"Matt Roger's RatedXmas is a hit at my University! I bought it for a guy friend of mine who happens to be in a fraternity. He and his brothers have listened to the album so much, the entire fraternity walks around singing the songs. I can't wait until Christmas-time when they have thier annual block party! RatedXmas will be blareing down University Boulevard!! Good Luck Mr. Rogers, you album is awesome!:)"
5,Liked it...,"Well, this book was good in that it helped me bring together the concepts I learned in class. Seems like the casebooks can be all over the place and having a horn book like this was nice."
3,"he may be the Duke, but...","As other reviewers have mentioned, Dukeminier's textbook is the most common book for property, leading one to believe that his outline should be a natural choice.In light of how much I pay for law school tuition, I decided to get some insurance by purchasing Gilbert's and Emanuel's outlines for most classes, and use the best of each for my course work.As a side effect of that, I was able to do a comparison between the two and I was surprised that Emanuel's consistently gave deeper and broader treatment of subjects, especially in Property and Contracts.Although Duke's outline is certainly useful, I strongly believe that you can do better with Emanuel's, which is also keyed to Duke's textbook."
4,Great Help,"I felt this was a great reference tool for my 1L property class, more concise than the Treatise, better black letter than the case briefs. Would recommend it as help with a very heavy subject."
4,Risque Roald at his best!,"Tantalizingly teasing and sexually seductive, thelascivious tales of Uncle Oswald will keep you enchantedas our hero hops from one bed to the next. Not only anentertainingly bawdy tale, but a prophetic commentary on the'sticky' world of human genetics and morality."
4,Love IT!,Just starting reading this for book club and I can't put it down. Very funny! It is great for summer when you want something fun and light. Give it a try!
4,Amusing but Inferior Dahl,"For completists, a necessity, but not his best work. He clearly had some fun writing it-- you'll have fun reading it. Best to stick with his short-stories, though-- they represent the cream of his adult fiction."
4,Great entertainment,"After reading and rereading Dahl's `children's' stories (which I have always maintained are really stories for grown-ups) to my kids I found ""My Uncle Oswald"" one day and read it straight though. This is a fantastically entertaining book that rather surprised me in the same way that finding a ""Mr. Roger's Teaches about Tantric Sex"" book would.The writing is quick paced and very readable and there's more than a little bit of social commentary underlying the plot. Like most of his books this one is fairly short with a good bit of sarcasm tossed in. And, like in most of his books, the grown-ups are still dolts and buffoons who only think they're in control.A really good read - will keep you laughing for a long time."
5,None,Extremely witty and imaginative. You cannot put it down. totally addictive. Dahl keeps us on the edge of our seats wondering what will happen next.
5,Juicy reading,"Roald Dahl's only adult novel, and had me wishing there was more. It's unlike anything I've ever read before; creative, brilliant and devilishly silly.Recommended reading!!"
5,A new fan of Dahl,"I can't wait for my next Roald Dahl book to get here! ""My Uncle Oswald"" was deliciously naughty and a good, quick read."
5,Genius at work,"Lets face it Dahl was a genius.Why on earth he never get a nobel prize is beyond me.Uncle Oswald is a joy to the world.Who's the greatest fornicator of all in the literary world MacDonald Frasers' Flashman or the hero of this novel,well I'll leave that up to you,either way a laugh a minute (they certainly give a new perspective on englishmen anyway)."
3,"Funny, Creative, but not Great","I enjoyed this book totally, but was astounded by the large amount of perfect reviews. This was a funny, funny book, but there was a lot of overblown craziness. The plot was rather linear, and the twist ending was not up to par for Dahl. All in all,classic Dahl- yes; genius- no."
4,Great Belly Laugh,"It is really great at times, to have a good belly laugh at the story. Even my serious wife read it, and she chuckled away while reading it. A really funny book and well worth reading it. Quite a change from the usual 'pie throwing' humour we normally get. This Englisg writer really has styie"
5,Refreshing-- a photography magazine that talks about photography!,"I started a subscription to Outdoor Photography last year at the recommendation of a friend. Despite the high price to receive this publication in the US, I feel it is worth it. For those of use who are used to reading fluff reviews and having 75% of the content in our magazines be product advertisements, Outdoor Photography is a refreshing change. The majority of this magazine deals with real photographers (especially amateurs) taking real photographs and the challenges along the way. Not only that, but the images in this magazine are top-notch. I enjoy reading product reviews where the reviewer isn't afraid to mention the weaknesses of a product along with its strengths. While the locations center around the UK, the techniques presented are universal."
4,"Beautiful photography, but repetitive","This used to be one of my favorite magazines, the photography is beautiful, but I recently stopped the many years of subscriptions because I felt it became rather repetitive. And given the price I decided it was not worth it for me. So maybe in a few years, I'll get another 1-year subscription. But a multi-year deal like I did before will not be in the future for me."
3,"Cicadelic Sixties, Vol 7 : From Teas to Tucson","CD condition excellent. Songs are familar and brought back memories of High School. Several members of the Lewallen Brothers were classmates of mine at TucsonHigh School. I am still close friends with one of the Brothers.""The Ghost"" from the ""Class of 57"""
3,"Good Pellets, but Carcinogenic",Good pellets for shooting but contains carcinogenic lead which has been proven to cause cancer. Beware if you will be out shooting with your kids... Ensure they wash their hands well after playing with these!
3,Soft Pellet Blister pack,"The can never opened! i just decided to cut a hole on the top of the can!and i shot birds in the chest and they fly away like nothing, im pretty sure they died later though! but it happend 2ce! i would give this 4 stars if the can opened though..."
1,...you had me at goodbye...,"...this movie is at the top of my list...unfortunately, it's the 'worst movie of all-time' list...that's right, ladies and gentlemen, friends and supporters of this film...this movie is trash (and not just for cuba's horribly annoying acting)...it's also one of the reasons so many relationships end up miserable...come on...do you really think renee would have ended up with this guy if his career went in the other direction...it was pure desperation rather than inspiration that made him succumb to showing up with his hat in his hands...and if all you base a relationship on, is the end justifying the means, well, i wish you luck with your next soul mate..."
1,It's a CHICK FLICK!!!!!,"Oh, this was one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen! Tom Cruise usually does a decent job in any EveryMan role he's played (even though he seems to be off his meds these days no matter what the Scientologists do for him), but this was just plain bad. ""You had me at hello"" and ""Show me the money"" became the most cloying expressions since ""Where's the beef?"". It has a mushy love story, a chubby cheeked kid, and makes you just want to run to the nearest barf bag because it's a stealth chick flick."
3,Great Movie - Bad Extras,"Bought this DVD cause we love the movie and thought the extras would be worth the extra dollars (over the standard DVD release).The main reason we bought it was for the audio commentary. Unlike other movies where this has provided great insight into the movie and the actors, this commentary is more like a reunion of actors that haven't been told they are being recorded. There are huge gaps of silence followed by comments such as ""I love this bit"" and ""this bit was great"" and fits of giggles.It is a huge waste! They obviously haven't watched other DVDs to understand the value-add they could have provided to the viewer.The other extras are OK (the Rod Tidwell ad is really cool and the deleted scenes are interesting) but even the commentary around some of these stinks.Don't get us wrong - we still love the movie in all ways but don't waste the extra dollars if a good commentary is what you are looking for."
4,A Modern Classic,"I love this movie so much! I saw it when I was in high school, and was really surprised at how much I loved it. I've never been a Tom Cruise fan, and at the time Renee was an unknown. Also, I'm not a sporty girl, why would I care about the life of a sport's agent? I don't know if it was the acting, the writing, great casting, wonderful settings, great editing, I just know that it all came together and will become a classic in the future."
4,You had me at hello ..........awe !! ( Sniffles and wipes away tears ),"Chic Flick ! Loved it ! Renee Z. and Tom Cruise and that CUTE KID... What a GREAT Movie !!!! If you love chic flicks GET THIS MOVIE. You wil laugh, cry, get angry, and then cry again with tears of joy. Oh and the KID that plays Renee's sone in the movie....he has got to be the cutest kid on earth. GET THIS MOVIE all you Tear Jerker lovers !Cuba Gooding Jr...SHOW ME THE MONEY !!!!!!!!! Buy this Movie for laughter and tears and then BOTH at the same time !"
5,It Completes Me.,"Jerry Maguire came out when I was in college. I was reluctant to watch it, but a group of my girl friends on my floor in the dorm invited me to watch it with them. Around 2 hours later, I'd found yet another movie that made it to the top of my favorites. When I first began collecting DVDs, Jerry Maguire was one of the first I bought. This is a wonderful movie with incredible acting performances throughout. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me feel and every single time I watch it, I feel yet again. If you have not yet seen this movie (I imagine maybe there are 5 people left in South Dakota or something who have yet to see it) you are missing out. It is absolutely amazing in every way!"
3,Pleasant Romantic Comedy,"Whilst half an hour too long, this is a romantic comedy of the sort that went out of fashion in the 1950s (in which Cruise's role would have been played by Cary Grant). The story is pure formula, with nothing to surprise or shock the viewer. The plus points are the quality of playing by the entire cast and the well-observed moments of comedy and pathos. Cruise and Zellweger work well together, and Gooding Jnr provides likable support. Nothing to write home about, but engaging enough in its own way."
4,show me the money,"great movie which has one of Cruise's most great performances as the sportsman Maguire who falls in love with mom Zellweger(whos just so sexy) and her kid Lipnicki(funny kid). Cruise is dumped by Kelly Preston(watch her in that nude scene, oh boy) and is dumped by Jerry O'Connell because he switched to some other contracter. Cuba Gooding Jr.(fantastic, ""show me the money"") is assigned to him. emotions spill and tensions rise and this one is one of the best films of 1996, period. the highlight in the film involves where Cruise comes to Zellweger's house drunk and Lipnicki wants to go to zoo and he talks to Gooding Jr. on thephone(uproarous)"
1,Don't Bother!,"We sat through this movie trying in vain to find the story. Aside from Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise there was nothing. Cruise's girlfriend in this flop made the movie, such as it was."
5,Superb,I always have been a big fan of Tom Cruise and this movie was one of his finest performances. Renee Zelwegger also remarkable. It was a kind of movie that you could see over and over again. It's a must see
1,didnt like it,it used the f word every other sentence. slow story line. wasn't sure if it was a chick flick or a sports movie. I'm not sure if the writers knew either. the only thing that was good was that tom cruise was in it. and he was still super weird.
4,Tom Cruse and Renee Zellwigger are a great combination,Good movie! Rent it first because it may not be a movie you want in your collection but I like the way these too work together. Great combination-comedy and drama.
5,Show me the money!,"Loved this money.....especially the love story part. Tom Cruise is at his youthful best, and Renee is a perfect gal for her part. Her little son steals the show."
2,A Classic?! Not Quite...,"Although it starts promising enough, this movie soon turns into another predictable and unsurprising romantic comedy. The story is pure Hollywood fluff and the typical and expected ending confirms it. Ok, the acting is quite good, everyone was believable and gave solid performances, yet the plot is full of cliches and sometimes it`s way too annoying in its tender and sappy moments. Cameron Crowe did a decent job directing this, but overall ""Jerry Maguire"" is a romantic comedy by-the-numbers, even if a couple of characters are a bit above cardboard charicatures. It`s a watchable movie, yet it brings nothing new and is far from innovative stuff.A rental at best."
2,Disgusting,"Has Hollywood no sence of decency? Hiring an 8-year-old boy to do nothing except utter a couple of sentences, say ""F**k you"" to the camera, and then make an obscence gesture at the camera? What's next...hiring kids to star in porno movies? It's a shame because this sequence spoiled what was otherwise a superb movie."
1,No English subtitles.,"Thought the script was totally wacky. Made no sense at all. Found myself fast forwarding it quite a bit because it seemed disconnected, dragged and very boring. In fact, it was one of the worst movies I ever saw. Maybe it's because I don't care that much for football, (though that was a small part of it). I think it was because the story line made absolutely no sense. And Tom's grinning off and on all the time for no reason didn't either. It appeared he seemed drunk all through the film. It made Renee, the gal who falls for Tom, (why?) appear off her rocker. Tom C. and Renee Z. should stick to better scripts, which Renee certainly has since she made this film, only Cuba G. kept it going."
2,Jerry-rigged?,"If only the film had maintained the same level of inventiveness of its opening sequence, this film (or should I say films?)showed promise. Unfortunately, it swiftly becomes a structural nightmare: a romantic comedy nested inside a storyline about a businessman/lawyer who finds his conscience (is that an oxymoron?); a buddy picture (an interracial one, at that!),etc. The talented Mr. Crowe would have done better to remember the admonition of Raymond Chandler: do not mix genres. (Perhaps this is a reason why Chandler's sometime collaborator, Billy Wilder declined to play the small role of sports agent Dicky Fox.)"
1,Same old Cruise character - Show me the ending!,"How many movies will Tom Cruise's character be down and out, and then to our suprise come back to win it all in the end? Try something new! This movie was boring. Cuba Gooding was good as always. The plot started off well with the whole ruthless agent thing and then went right down the toilet. I bet lots of middle aged couples with bratty little kids enjoyed this but I did not."
4,a good movie,"A good Tom Cruise movie before he got so weird and became the ""superstar"" celebrity of Scientology. DVD quality is much better on blu-ray than on the pervious DVD versions."
4,"Surprisingly, this movie has some heart","I think some of the popularity of this movie stems from the way that it is able to successfully integrate elements of romance, sports, and humor so that it has something for everyone. We really feel for the characters involved, and the plethora of subplots all manage to garner some interest. But in the end, the vacillation between commitment and breakup by Cruise make his character less than sympathetic, and even though he insists that Zellweger completes him, I wasn't convinced it was for keeps, dramatic score to the contrary."
2,very average,"it's a reason that Cuba Gooding JR got all the juice.he was the best thing about the film.and let me not forget Regina King.this film showed Black folks with class,status&down to earth.as for the other actors Tom Cruise is Hollywood's BOy.he is Money.i've never felt that he could act his way out of a paper bag but he has always had the right script to make him look good.he is vastly overrated.Renee Zellweger is over acting she is really lame same goes for the kid.this film tries to many things all at once."
1,Jerry Maguire,"The movie is great, but the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. I have to use ""captioning for the hearing impaired"" and I am not of Latino heritage. This movie does not provide captioning for the hearing impaired in English - but in Spanish.The producer(s) of this DVD apparently don't care much for the English hearing impaired."
2,Highly Overrated,"I was enjoying this movie until Renee Zellweger's spineless character came into the picture. And I'm glad that I wasn't the only person who thought that the kid was annoying! The movie became a slow and sappy chick flick instead of being the strong and fresh sports film that I had anticipated on seeing!But I have to say, Cuba's got the hottest body ever featured on film!...Lord have mercy!"
1,It sucks!!!!,"The most horrible, stupid and boring film I've ever seen on my life. The people who like it are so stupid."
5,One Of My Favorite Movies.,"I love this movie. I'm writing this review just after I've viewed the movie. I usually write longer reviews, but I don't feel this movie calls for one. It's funny, serious, and will definitely leave you feeling good. The acting is just wonderful, and the three main characters (Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Renee Zelwegger) are all great and memorable (as is the nanny, haha. Or, ""Child Technician"". Yeah, anyways...). Buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever. Watch this movie. I don't think you'll regret it. That's all I wanna say."
4,You will want to find your own guardian angel.....,"I was given this book to read by someone and wasn't real sure of it, but once I read it I wanted to start reading more about angels.This is real life accounts of how guardian angels have been there in peoples lives.It makes you think and wonder about all the times you yourself have had close encounters and wonder if it were your guardian angel protecting you.It's a feel good book."
5,Gorgeous magazine rack,"I had been searching for some time for a magazine rack. When I found this one on Amazon, I was not disappointed. So well made and a beautiful accessory for my family room. Love it!"
1,Terrible!,Ordered two as Xmas gifts. They arrived broken and bent. One was actually missing legs! Very heavy and so very clumsy to repack and ship back. The packaging upon arrival was horrible. Just thrown into one huge box. No wonder they were broken!
1,It BLOWS,"All this is a ""fundraiser vid""... 45 measly minute intro to entice you into buying ""complimentary"" products. 45 minutes of very mediocre content for around $[...] bucks is not even close to worth it at all.Nice cover art, but far litle else...GOOD Money *far better spent* elsewhere..."
2,Not very helpful.,This video was not very helpful and just seemed to be a cover as being instructional but was more for entertainment it seemed.
3,Decent call.,"With this call you can inhale or exhale giving you two adjustable calls in one. Problem is that the inhale call really doesn't work all that well. The exhale call seems pretty good, haven't hunted with it yet but it sounds good. The inhale is okay for grunts but none of the doe calls were anywhere near as realistic as on the exhale side. Common to most calls, but the reed is fragile and the adjustment feature means you'll handle it and have a pretty high chance of making this useless if you bend the reed."
3,GOOD,The buck call on this product works great. You can make several different sounds. The doe call is not very accurate at all.
3,Art for the yard,I love the pineapple shape and think it adds a welcoming touch to our front yard. In fact I love the look so much that I've decided to use it as art rather than a bird feeder.I tried using it as a birdfeeder but there were two drawbacks.1. Sunflower seeds were the only feed large enough not to spill out immediately all over the ground.2. All those sunflower seeds were irresistable to squirrels. The squirrels were so heavy that they bent the metal peices at the bottom intended for birds to use as perches.
4,Chicago area history,"""Chicago's, Historic Pullman District"" is a compilation of rare photographs that capture the quaintness of this industrial town and era. The construction began in the early 1880's and continues today as restoration. The saga of the Pullman Company and the Pullman family is only a backdrop for the images of this unique town. The industrial, commercial and residential architectural views and the essence of a hard working people establishing a close knit permanent community is captured pictorially throughout the book. The Pullman district has acqired National, State and City Landmark status. The book is a valuable supplement to any tour of the area or any serious research on the history of Chicago."
4,"Interesting photos, informative book","I love books that teach me about eras past and after visiting the Pullman District south of Chicago in person, I wanted to learn more. This book was totally useful. I would recommend getting it BEFORE going on the Pullman tour though, just so you are more versed in the area before you go."
3,Good News to the Poor,This is another book I had to purchase for a class regarding living with the poor. Found it to be very good and knowledgeable.
1,It just keeps going down hill,Gun Digest has been going down hill every year since it sold out to new owners back around 1999. This year is a new low. Very few articles and many errors in the canned specs.
1,How Low Can You Go,"Can't wait till the 2008 issue comes out to see how much further you can go to destroy what used to be an excellent publication. No articles, canned content, and errors abound in this publication. Was going to give it 2 stars so I have the ability to downgrade if next years digest gets any worse."
2,gun digest,I was not as pleased with this addition as past issues.It lacked the type articals and stories that I have enjoyed in the past.
5,Superb!,"If you are somewhat familiar with Baroque music, you know that John Eliot Gardiner and Baroque music go hand in hand. His interpretation's of JS Bach are just inspiring. I listened to this entire 2-CD recording with full engagement.This is the best recording of Bach's ""Christmas Oratorio"" by far!"
3,A gardiner recording,"The orchestra is good, soloists are good, but I still don't have the head full of music and pleasure this kind of masterpiece should bring, especially for christmas.a completely agree on the fact that the Karl Richter version is the very best, not because of who performs in it, but because each time I listen to it, a feeling of joy comes with it.I'm not saying gardiner isn't good, i'm saying I prefer Richter. (don't any of u guys come tell me I'm talking nonsense! These are my misical tastes!)"
2,Gardiner in his garden,"This is the first time I have heard this wonderful work beginning with a military march! I thought it was suppose to be a praise of the christmas message. Gardiner has got it wrong. His very ""forced"" conducting makes you think that he wants to improve on ""the old bore of christmas music"". If you want it right you return to Richter's good old Christmas Oratorio - which sounds much newer - even by technical standards than Gardiner's. And you get it at bargain prize. Richter's ""Jauchzet, Frohlocket"" is full of praise - mighty music. And the words are so nicely phrased by the Münchener Bach Choir. I wonder if the Monteverdi Choir knows what they are singing. Do I need to say that the singing of Janowitz and Ludwig is by far superior to that of Argenta and von Otter. And that Wunderlich and Crass are so much better than Bär and the funny noises produced by Blochwitz that you sometimes doubt if it is the same music."
5,ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL AMBIENT WORK,"This 2005 album is more 'pure' ambient than some of Thompson's other work (note that it's recorded on the Hypnos label, which produces many great ambient albums).The album is long, languid, and sonorous, with mild, sustained discordances (which are never strong enough or long enough to be unpleasant) occasionally interspersed with lightly tinkling piano notes, bells or chimelike sounds. It produces a feeling of drifting, while watching a slowly-evolving environment (such as the clouds on the cover art).This album is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of RST's work, or other ambient music in general."
2,Poor quality for a high price,"I thought with a price tag UGG has, it would be pure heaven on my feet. Why is this brand popular? I suppose over the years they've slacked on quality. but I'm generally comparing a pair of sheepskin boots from Chooka I purchased over 7 years ago. Chooka are sturdily made, thick, non-shedding sheepskin, durable soles and withheld inside and outside. The total opposite with the over-hyped UGGs, the soles here are like cardboard, the interior is sparse and overall cheap, poor quality."
1,TOO SMALL,"NEED TO EXCHANGE FOR SIZE 10, WILL NEED TO SEND BACK TO EXCHAGE THEM. SO WILL SEND THEM SO FASTY"
2,love UGGs but not these,"they fit a bit big so if you are a half size order down instead of up a size. I have to say these are very, very confortable, however if you live in an area with lots of wind or static in the air you are going to hate these. I can't even wear them for half an hour without getting progresively stronger zaps when i touch something. I tried 100% cotton socks, heck i tried no socks, i sprayed static guard inside etc. so now i have an expensive pair of boots sitting in my closet holding down the carpet"
4,"great, but not perfect","This is a great ""Messiah"" -- fun to listen to, and rarely drags. My quibbles are few, but I do have some. First, I take issue with the division of alto/counter-tenor solos. I think it should be performed by a counter-tenor with enough range. I have heard any number of fantastic counter-tenors who can pull it off. It was written for a man, after all. Speaking of which, this was written for a choir of men and boys. The pretension towards authenticity, with period instruments etc, is nothing more than that -- mere pretension -- without a boys and men choir. Finally, I agree with the amazon.com reviewer in the criticism of the bass soloist; he is the weakest link in the recording -- boring and mushy-sounding. But all in all, a great recording. Better ""Messiah""s are out there, but they are certainly few and far between."
2,Didn't like soloists,"Handel's Messiah includes my favorite aria for bass and on this CD it sounds bad: ""The trumpet shall sound"" is completely butchered by Tomlinson. As are all other pieces with Tomlinson. Von Otter sounds weak on this CD although I like her in general. I much prefer the recording with CSO/Solti."
5,Very beautiful playing and singing,"For those who are interested in hearing a great period instrument performance of ""Messiah"", Pinnock's recording is a must-have. The orchestra and choir are great, and the soloists are in top form.Arleen Auger once again sings with angelic quality and von Otter's performance of ""He was Despised"" is very emotional.While there isn't much ornamentation in the arias, this recording is a great listen."
4,Almost perfect,"This recording is one soloist shy of perfection. Before you buy it, listen to the bass. John Tomlinson's sound is simply not to my taste. It's a jowelly, yawning, almost lazy sound with more vibrato than I think is warranted by Handel. Bad? No, but I've gone to the point of making a playlist consisting of this recording less the bass solos and plus another bass (John Cheek on the Westenburg recording) filling in for all of Tomlinson's parts.Other than that, this is the recording to own. The recording quality is great and balanced, the choir and orchestra are tight and coherent, the the conductor injects the right baroque, dance-like quality into the tempi and interpretation. Michael Chance is flawless in his alto solos - a clear, full, powerful countertenor voice, precisely what the voice should be. The other soloists, with the notable exception of Tomlinson, give similarly enjoyable performances."
3,dry numbers,"of course useful and informative, but just a little too dry, heavy and complicated for non-experts."
3,Marginal item,"Please don't pay the current price of $25 plus because you will feel ripped off; Amazon recently ran this for about $12, and it's barely worth that. Why?1. The glass workmanship is so-so. If Amazon provided a closeup picture instead of the one they did, you would immediately know what I'm talking about. The welding and quality of the glass are definitely mediocre. This was made in China, and it shows.2. The item is held together with clear, filament line that doesn't appear to be very sturdy, plus it's almost not sufficient given the weight of the glass. If you hang this outside, exposed to the elements, you can expect the line to break; I know this from experience. I'm going to restring it with stronger line."
1,good girls go bad,This doll was givin to my daughter for her 10 birthday by one of her friends. I was outraged by the appearence of this doll...
3,Thoroughly Researched but Narrow,"There's no question about the author's academic credentials not the amount and quality of research that was put into this book. However, I think the book would be better titled ""Conversion in the Early Roman Empire"" since the focus is on the depth, type, and duration of the conversions that added mass to Christianity. This is an interesting and valuable point but, unlike other books dealing with the issue, there is not much depth regarding sociological aspects. For instance urbanization is touched upon but the role of women, birth rates, and general pagan practices are left at the periphery or ignored. This makes for a focused but narrow work. With the title given I was expected something with more breadth. The prose is also somewhat dull. I would recommend Paul Stephenson's Constantine as a better read that deals with pretty much the same subject matter."
2,Confusing,I found MacMullen's writing style difficult and confusing and gave up after the first two chapters.
4,looking for the nuggets of gold,"as with all Graham books you must look thru a ton of old examples, and outdated material to find the few nuggets of gold. Not that it is not worth the mining. It would make a great book if somebody that really new anaylsis could redue the book with up to date examples, and a few less pages."
2,Very dofferent from the 2nd edition,The 3rd edition was VERY different from the 2nd edition. I liked the 2nd edition a lot more.
5,Informative and Entertaining Guide to South Carolina,"This book provides excellent information on the sites, restaurants, accomodations, and history of South Carolina. I enjoyed reading it immensely because not only was it was humorous and well written, but it has a lot of interesting historical details and unique suggestions for things to see and do."
5,Brilliant Insights,"Hannah Arendt's ""On Revolution"" is a long meditation on the French and American Revolutions, and why the former, albiet a violent failure, came to direct the course of modern human affairs while the latter was a unique success.For Arendt, the American Revolution succeeded because its purpose was to seek freedom, and there was enough of a tradition of liberty and freedom in America for the founding fathers to create the political apparatus (the Constitution, division of powers, the Senate, the Supreme Court) that would permit public virtue to override public opinion. The founding fathers were men whose ambition was to seek distinction and excellence.The French Revolution was a completely different animal, driven by a desperate population to relieve its suffering and misery. The pathos and emotions rampant in the revolution -- especially the poor's hatred of the rich -- soon morphed into a bloodbath of violence."
5,"Wonderful Recording, Unfortunately Out of Print","The composition is a tour de force, written by Handel at the age of 22 to showcase his skill in choral music -- which this recording certainly does. Outstanding historically informed performance led by Simon Preston. Of particular note: an inspired rendering of the soprano duet ""De Torrente"" by Diana Montague and the legendary Arleen Auger."
5,Barbie and Krissy Stroll 'n Play Dolls,"Barbie loves to take her baby sister Krissy and her friend to the park for the day. She can stroll them all around town in their cool double stroller with fun activities for baby. But that's not all - the stroller converts into a play gym for on-the-ground fun for Krissy and her friend and it also converts into two baby carriers that really rock back and forth! Includes 11-1/2-inch Barbie doll, 2-1/2-inch Krissy doll with friend and 3-in-1 stroller."
5,Good stepping stone to Rudin,"I read and studied this book before moving on to Baby Rudin, and it helped a great deal. Although it's not perfect by any means, it's one of the best undergraduate analysis texts I've seen. It has the rigor and thoroughness of Baby Rudin, combined with more motivation, a freer style, and a willingness to talk to the student more (rather than past the student, as Baby Rudin often does). It's too bad more people haven't heard of it."
5,great CD,"I got this for my daughter when she was 3, and she still loves it at 5. Great music to have on as you prepare for Shabbat, as well as on Shabbat itself. It was the first Shabbat CD we bought, and it's a really nice introduction. I highly recommend it."
5,BETTER THAN TRUE,"This early grouping of songs made the band what it was - one of the romantic movement's greats, until they penned the song 'True' and ruined it all. Give this one a spin and you'll soon see why. Pay particular attention to ""To Make A Long Story Short"" & the incredible club fave ""Muscle Bound"". This CD almost makes you want to out & get an asymetrical haircut & some eyeliner. DON'T DO IT!!!! But do pick this up if you can find it!!!"
3,An Intersting read,"I found this book to be very interesting. It had techiniques i was already familiar with ( creating and ebossed stamp), but it also had sometechiniques like oragami phot corners which i though was so cool to use fo rmy scrapbook on my trip to china. I think it is useful for beginners as they search for various ideas, it is an inspirational book that will help with basic techiniques with stamps and thier versitile uses.i only gave it three starts b/c it did not wow me the way other books on scrapbooking techniques have and the directions are a little vague in some instances."
2,Short Life Span,I too got a little over one year of use from my Delta 36-220. It experienced a complete motor failure. Repair cost was greater than the cost of a new identical one. The saw worked very well up to it's failure. I would not purchase another Delta Miter Saw!
2,Blade guard is poor design,The saw cuts well and has plenty of power. The sticking arm on the blade guard broke the plastic attachment point. I've noticed that this is the only model I've seen from Delta that has a plastic attachment point for the blade guard arm. Will keep you in shape moving it around.
3,Works fine for me,"My brother gave me this saw, as he found a 12"" on sale that he bought to replace it. I've never had a complaint; used it to put together a raised bed garden, spice racks, drawers, and planning to build a set of shelves next week. Replaced the stock blade with more fine-toothed one, and other than that, works just fine.The dust collection bag has to be an in-joke to someone in the design department; it's there for looks only. It's also heavy enough to be a pain in the butt to lug around.But for the $99 I see someone selling a used one for, if the motor works well, it's a bargain; the saw cuts just fine, which is all I need it to do."
4,"Excellent value for stationary use, not very portable","This saw is a great value. It cuts smooth (especially with a new carbide blade) and cuts anything. Miter works well, compound adjustment ok. Dust collection (even attached to vac) is poor. The only real problem with this product is it is very very heavy. For jobsite use I'd buy much lighter unit."
2,"Solid, but did not last","This saw is really not portable (which was fine), cut and power was great. The supplied accessories were also nice. I had purchased mine to use on a new addition, the motor went just out of warranty (due to surgery I hadn't used it for more than a year during the warranty period). Delta was unresponsive to emails, letters, and appathetic on phone calls. Repair cost exceeded that of a replacement, and I couldn't replace it with the same (didn't feel it would last). Very much supprised me how sort the life was on it, the 8 1/4 Delta I have has been going for more than 12 years (and actually had to pick up the slack for this one)."
1,Could'nt believe it!,I purchased this same stand through Amazon a year or so back and it went together like a gloove and I have been very pleased with it. I would give it five stars. I ordered another one a couple a weeks ago disregarding the poor ratings at Amazon. When it arrived the box was half open. Luckily all the componets were still inside but the top was damaged on one corner. When I assembled the stand I found that the four top braces were a inch and one half to short. I assembled it anyway with great effort and sure enough the holes in the top would not line up. Will have to drill new holes if I don't decide to send it back.Shame on Delta for letting a quaility table get out with wrong parts in it. Seems there are quality and packaging issues here!
1,50-322 Planar Stand,"The planar stand could not be put together without grinding off some metal so that the cross piece bolt holes could be aligned with the holes in the legs. Once the metal part of the stand was finally put together. the platform top had no set of pre-drilled holes that would align with the holes in the metal structure for attaching the platform top. So I had to drill a set of holes. When finally put together, it would not fit into the mobile base designed for this stand. All in all, badly designed and extermely difficult to execute for parts that are supposed to fit together (a characteristic for which I paid a premium). In the future I would not pay for Delta designed stands or mobile bases."
1,Shocked,"I couldn't believe it when only a few small pieces of the stand arrived (in a very large box) It didn't even resemble a stand! The top, all of the legs, three of the feet and two side braces were all missing.I was pleased, however, with Amazon's return policy."
4,optional stand,"Delta is now offering a free stand with a purchase of a model no. 22-565 planer. Thisis for your information only. You may want to review this situation. If this stand is the same one your offering, then my review is that this is a strong durable stand at a good price. Easy to assemble and smart looking.RegardsThomas a Lawrence"
2,Ignore previous reviewer -- password protection IS a major problem,"Even if you copy the templates to your hard drive, you CANNOT customise the many password-protected spreadsheet templates included on the CD.Even more disappointingly, the password prevents you from using Excel's audit function to trace formulae components.This means that to understand formulae one must resort to the tedious, stone-age method of looking in the formula bar and noting down by hand that the formula is, for example,"" = (sum (A6:G12)) * [next sheet!]Q7 + ([sheet 7!]T78 / [sheet 3!] c24)"", and then translating it all into English.In summary, if you want to teach yourself from this book it will cost you a very substantial time investment in addition to the book's cover price."
3,Good Ideas - BUT You Can't Customize the Spreadsheets,"Some good ideas about applying Microsoft Excel are included in book and the accompanying CD-ROM. But unfortunately the included models are not practical for most American readers. They use English nomenclature - NPAT instead of Net Income, etc. - and have formatting that looks ok on screen but is less than presentation quality when printed.The author has password protected the spreadsheets so you can't customize them to your own needs. A serious drawback for the serious user, clearly the intended readership for this book."
1,funny as bleep,just listening to the clips you can tell this is something somebody made in there basement. just listen to the sexy boy clip you might laugh yourself senseless. not even worth a thought :)
1,Doesn't work at all,"I tried this in the privacy of my home before wearing it out in public--fortunately. It was a matter of seconds before the dress's halter top came away from my skin. The sad thing is, the dress actually fits perfectly by itself, so the tape didn't have much work to do--and still it failed.Maybe packing tape would work better."
5,Love it! The perfect Bridal Gift!,"Ok, my girlfriend got married last year and we desperatly needed it back then -- thankfully, it was included in a Bridal Gift basket at a wedding i was in this summer -- it was so cute but also practical: 2 girls didn't even own strapless bras! No worries, we stuck the straps down with some Hollywood Fashion tape and the wedding was beautiful! I will carry the Fashion Tape with me from now on."
5,HURRAY!!! on DVD at Last,"Just recently I've been watching the old Granda Plus episode's that I receorded, and it's still as good as it was, I'm soooo pleased it's come onto DVD I'm definetly buying this, I think Leroy & Bruno are gorgeous"
5,buy it! buy it! buy it!,We've been waiting for this for a long long time. I hope the other seasons are on the way...thank you.
5,"Wholesome, Intelligent Entertainment! Wow!","I recall how much I enjoyed this TV series when it was new, but now that I am older, I can appreciate its qualities even more. This series demonstrates that it is possible to create a show about real life situations, conflicts, pressures and choices that teenagers (and adults) face in life that is intelligent, funny, heartwarming, respectful and uplifting. Wow! There is no crude language and no stupidity masquerading as humor! Plus the music and dancing are fantastic. Need I say more?I am considering buying more copies of this series as a gift for some young friends.As another reviewer noted: the discs and package liner are mislabeled regarding the episodes included on each disc. It is all there, but it has 4 episodes per disc, with 16 episodes in all."
1,Hubristic fool,"Unfortunately, I find this to be one of the most idiotic stories I have ever read. It is the story of a young man with no respect for the enormity of nature. His story is akin to waiting on a beach to watch a category 5 hurricane make landfall. I feel sorry for Chris' familyI love Krakauer's other books."
3,Great story - author strays,"I had heard so much about this book that I had to read it. I also heard Singer/Songwriter Ellis Paul perform a song he wrote about the book. Also, I have a CD by ""Eddie from Ohio"" that mentions McCandless.The facts of the story are fascinating and it stirs noble themes while entertaining you as well. McCandless definitely had a ""book worthy"" life. The author however strays off into unrelated things often. He embellishes for two whole chapters about himself - interesting but not related enough. I often got the impression that he was trying to make the book longer than it needed to be.Nevertheless, the book is great."
4,A tragic adventure is thoughtfully examined.,"Krakauer is a wonderful writer - I've just blown through this book as well as Into Thin Air and Eiger Dreams, and for me - his writing is the kind of stuff that makes for late nights and tired workdays. I can't pay him a higher compliment. This one was a bit different than his other efforts in that Krakuer plays more the role of detective/sociologist rather than an an insightful expedition biographer. However, the story was as rivetting and perhaps even more powerful. I'm anxiously awaiting his next one!"
3,"Well-written, but fails to provide a complete picture.","While Krakauer is an excellent author, I was amazed that he failed to delve more deeply into the subject of the religious convictions of the subject of the book (Chris McCandless). I would have finished the book much more satisfied if the author had offered a more complete picture of McCandless's search for purpose and meaning in life. McCandless believed in God, or so we must believe since his last written words (as included in the book) include thanks to the Lord and mention of God. Jon Krakauer identifies with McCandless and his search for an identity, but why did the author avoid the more serious question of why someone with some belief in a higher power would seek salvation in the wilds of Alaska? Why did McCandless look down, at the Earth, rather than up, to God in Heaven, when he went looking for ""the answer""?"
2,More than McCandless,"This book began in an interesting way, but fizzled out at mid point. It was difficult to follow because it is not completely linear in its time line and often a location is mentioned without naming the State it's connected to. I was interested in learning what happened with McCandless or a possible reason for his lack of rational. Unfortunately, the story begins to discuss other people who have done similarly foolhardy things and this is where the book became a chore to read. I would not recommend this book unless it is a strong topic of interest to you."
2,SO damaged!,"The book said it was in good-great condition however the cover was completely bent and so were the pages, it wasnt too bad but it really wasnt good or great."
2,Into the wild not Into thin air,Into the wild was intersting but slow. Into thin air is much more riveting. There's probably other action books more worthy of your time!
3,Holy Disturbing Batman!,"I found Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer somewhat disturbing-- but all in all a good read. As one who is not espeicially into the outdoors, I was surprised at how fast this book went. Although at times I found some of Krakauer's insertion of his personal experiences into the book both inappropriate and unnecessary-- I loved how the book let me get into this enigmatic man's mind. Krakauer did a great job of letting the reader understand McCandless' mental side by going as far as quoting highlighted passages in the recreational books he read. If you don't usually read non-fiction or writing about the outdoors-- this would be a great book to take a break from your norm. The story was just so compelling and puzzling that I doubt many would be unineterested. Although Krakauer's insistently journalistic style got to me after a while-- I gave this book 3 stars because it was curiously confusing and hard to put down."
5,This book is not for everybody.,"This book is about one man's search for nature and true freedom. A life so far removed from mainstream society most people will balk. If you dream of escaping to a world of nature and adventure you will love this book. If you are content with a stable predictable life, look elsewhere."
2,"Lotta hype, lame book","This is a lame book. You can condense the whole thing into this: A nut of a guy, travels around like a hobo; there are descriptions of other nuts cases; and the author tells a few of his climbing stories. This is a short story that has been hyped into a book. Waste of time."
4,"get out your highlighter pen for this one , you'll need it.","This book is for anyone with an ounce of adventure in their blood. Not everyone is willing to forgo the comforts of their favorite armchair to brave their own neighborhood streets , let alone burn their money and stick out their thumb! I was mostly impressed with the passages quoted from such infamous writers as Muir, Tolstoy, London, and Thoreau. These are the books that spured McCandless' imagination and gave him the fortitude to pursue his dreams, no matter how wild or dangerous. After I read this book I sent passages to a couple of friends that seemed in a rut. I made sure to highlight those parts that I thought applied to them. Then they went out and bought the book for themselves."
4,"Why is the question, not what","I felt that Krakauer did a fine job of investigating,presenting, and developing theories to who McCandles was as a person and what he did. But for all you readers out there who wanted to know exactly what McCandles did and why, I got three words for you HE WAS ALONE, therefore noone knows exactly what he did. So the best thing, or at least the only thing Krakauer could do, is to make comparisons, and allusions to other people in order to make sense of what happened. And I feel that Krakauer did make as much sense of what happened as he could and therefore he accomplished his goal. This, i felt, makes the book worth the read."
4,Interesting and thought provoking,"This book is wonderful. It made me think so deeply about my own dreams and my own aspirations. I have had the same desire to leave home and hit the road to experience life to it's fullest. I couldn't make as drastic of choices and decisions that Chris McCandless chose, but I would like to think that I would still be able to feel as much freedom that Chris enjoyed. Krakauer writes about Chris McCandless with such passion and description that I feel as though Chriss is talking to me through the text. While reading the book I felt a connection that no other book has made with me in a long time. No other book has made me think more about myself than Into The Wild. -Brian-"
4,Into the Wild,"I had to read this book for my AP English class. I found it to be a very interesting account of a very tragic story. Towards the end it did seem a little repetitive, but other than that Krakauer does a very good job of retelling the sad story of Chris McCandless. He also has a variety of different sources for the telling of the story so the reader can get the full experience that McCandless did."
4,T.H. from Wyoming,"In my opinion, the story of Chris McCandless, told in Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer, is an extremely interesting story. Living in Wyoming, this account has a large personal inpact. It is easy to imagine what Chris McCandless' family was going through during the time when Chris was no where to be found. Jon Kraukauer picked a very interesting topic on which to write. Kraukauer's portrayal of who Chris McCandless was and what he stood for helps the readers of this story to appreciate the power and the forces of the wild."
4,A moving true story,"I feel that the journalistic account ""Into The Wild"", by Jon Krakauer, was well researched and written. The plot of the account was constantly changing, so the narrative was as unpredictable as Chris McCandless' life. Chris McCandless, the subject of the book, is motivated by very powerful feelings. I believe that his sense of adventure was a force that drove him harder than any of his other senses. Jon Krakauer captures this sense of adventure in an organized and captivating way. His interpretation of events flows evenly and methodically with the actual events undertaken by Chris McCandless. Overall, this biography was superbly written, researched, and gave the proper emphasis to Chris McCandless' exciting life and tragic death. DO in Wyoming"
2,"Interesting, but hard to follow","I would have to say that this book did not do much for me. Don't get me wrong - McCandless was a really fascinating guy, and I was interested in his story. I thought, however, that Krakauer could have done a better job of making it interesting. I found the story hard to follow because Krakauer didn't tell it from beginning to end, but jumped around from place to place. I understand that he didn't know all the facts between different locations, but I still think he could have made the book more interesting. I do have a lot of respect for McCandless for doing what he did, though."
3,"good, but repetative","this book was excellent and engrossing in the begining, but near the middle and end, krakauer kept on repeating the same story and ideas, and it just got boring"
5,Brave and Free...,"""Into the Wild"" is one of those treasures you rarely find in non-fiction media. This is a journey of ultimate freedom. Chris McCandless walks away from a life that many would envy. He becomes a nomad in a country that cherishes stability and security. He bravely did what most people just talk about. His adventures in the underground realm of the United States of America are truly fascinating. I admire his love and pursuit for such a raw freedom, but it scares me to even think about doing something similar. I just simply find the whole account of his journey fascinating, yet very haunting. Nature can be a dangerous playground, especially for us post-modern, urban Americans. I can't help but think what Chris McCandless did is not that out of the ordinary for most other countries, but shows how we, Americans, are too comfortable with our security and stability to truly be free. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
3,"An intriguing story, but is it a tale worth telling?","'Into the Wild' is the true story of Chris McCandless, a twenty-something kid from a well-to-do family in Virginia who takes off for the wilderness of Alaska on a Dante-esque journey. McCandless's travels make for an intriguing story -- He ventures from the fields of the Dakotas to the deserts of Mexico with almost nothing but his wits. But the question is, and the author touches upon this quandary in the book: Why should we care? McCandless can be seen in one of two ways: One of the last true idealists who rejects society and its conventions; or a mixed up kid with no common sense. However you view McCandless will ultimately define whether or not you enjoy this book."
2,A Book with No Adventure,i thought this book was boring and even though it was supposed to be adventurous i found the book to be very boring. it is a great story but poorly written.
2,Not for Anyone Under 16.......,"We had to read this for our literature class. I've read books that aren't directed towards my age group, but this was.......weird. It is interesting as to why people think Chris McCandless went out into the wild, and to hear what his family said, but this book just drags on and on and on. It makes a better magazine article, and you've gotta love and understand nature to the fullest. It taught me that life is precious, though, but the book's saving grace is the authors talent with words."
3,Well enough for what it is...,"This book is a great way to kill time at an airport, bus station, or insurance seminar. It is essentially an extended magazine article, sweatily manipulated in order to get to the Cibola of two-hundred pages. Krakauer is a decent writer, with a decent vocabulary (despite misusing the word ""enormity"" to mean ""vastness""), and a spiritual kinship with Chris McCandless, the silly man whose naivete, idealism, and, let's face it, pretension, led to his starvation.Ironically, you won't find ""meaning"" here...but you will find a page-turning, entertaining little book."
4,A great book,"Jon Krakauer has been very lucky with his assignments with Outside Magazine. Granted, getting stuck in a blizzard on Mt Everest isn't what most people would describe as lucky; however, he sure has profitted fom writing Into The Wild and Into Thin Air. This book is very well researched but does tend to drag at points, especially when he brings in his own personal accounts. Over all, I would say he's an alright writer who has benefitted from being at the right place at the right time. This book is definitely worth your time."
4,"Although sensationalized, a fascinating look at the search","Krakauer's narrative is tight, although at times inaccurate. For better or worse, McCandless has become an archetype for a certain stratum of society. Here in Alaska, the book polarizes people. Either Chris was some kind of Thoreau savant or an absolute idiot. The book is worthwhile for this reason. To answer a question posed in these reviews, the bus has become a bit of a shrine. I've been there. It's a relatively brutal hike in, especially if the Tek is high. His clothes are still there, as are his boots, a notebook for visitors and a plaque. Only about 30 people or so have made it up there, though. Be aware that Krakauer's distances are off."
4,Perfect for any idealistic college student planning a trip,"Krakauer enters the mind of this troubled, idealistic young man in an amazing feature story about the tragic death of Chris McCandless. My only gripe with this book is the confusing chronological order. However, it teaches us to never test nature because we will lose."
3,Moving Story,"Chris McCandless lead a life that most of us would like, but are afraid to do it. I liked Krakauer's writing. However, one chapter moved me and the next one I totally disliked. I didn't like when he talked about other adventurers and when he talked about his adventures. That kept the story from moving forward. When I got to those parts, I just put the book down. He should have kept the story moving, instead of wanting us to pat him on the back for his dangerous adventures."
4,Compelling book,"The book started out not really interesting, but as it spanned out it became a factor the realistic feeling you get when he describes the adventures that he goes on and the description of this life great writer. The middle is some what of a tease but well worth reading. Might not be a type that you will understand first time reading."
4,Freedom of the Independent Traveller,"In search of self-discovery and freedom from the shackles of society, Chris McCandless goes on a journey to Alaska. On his journey Chris finds himself and touches the lives of others in his wake. Although he died before he could share his story, the author, Jon Krakauer, uses his own experiences and the experiences of others to understand Chris's plight and reasons for his journey. The author's use of interviews and people Chris had met helped to give Chris a human side as opposed to making him a subject that people could not relate to. I enjoyed this book because I understand Chris's own natural call to the wilderness and his need to get away from society."
3,Into the Wild,This book Into the Wild is about a young man named Christopher Maccandles who couldn't stand to live in a regular world. He went to Alaska into the wild and gave all his posessions away and create a new life. Chris could have had the normal life but he wanted something more exciting. Basically this book is about people who met Chris and who were interested in him. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in wilderness.
3,Alaskan Odessy,"Hi my name is Ariana O'Connor and I will like to send in a book review to you on the book Into the Wild by: Jon Krakauer. Book Review: This book is recommended to readers especially at the teenage and adult level, anyone who is trying to discover their identity, and are make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. This book is a fictional biography of a young man wanting to discover his true self by facing the concentrated, vastness of the Antarctic tundra, the wild. This book is one of its kind of enlightening what seems to be just another pointless death of someone trying to take on the wild, through parallels of historical examples, the author's own experience on this topic, and real quotes from those who befriended this high spirited vagabond. Into the Wild, a book with too many facts fed at once but get the satisfaction of being captivated by capturing the spirit of truth, innocence, and adventure of the truly naive, and pure of heart. Must read!"
2,Not too Great,"I was disappointed in this book. As others have said, it should have remained a magazine article because there really isn't enough substance, in my opinion, for a book. I think the main character was part immature (for a 24 year old man) and part crazy. I had some difficulty following the time-line. It was never real clear to me just exactly what this guy was searching for."
4,A Good Read!!!,"Many people disagreed with the choice that Christopher McCandless made to go into the wild. He was a young adult fresh out of college when he decided to go on ""an adventure of a lifetime"". Chris drops all of his posessions and gives his remaining $25,000 to charity to hitch-hike to Alaska where he can escape the norms of society. Many people say he was unprepared for his journey and immature because he did not accept any help or advice from anyone. He did what he wanted to do. That is what makes this such a good book. We all have a time when we dream of getting away from everything, but many of us leave it at that. Chris McCandless fulfilled his dream. Even though he did not make it back, he had the courage to leave his possesions and attempt to live off the land. This is beyond what many of us would even consider."
3,Great start but tailed off,I felt that the intial start of the story was well written and of couse was the main point of the story part. the story of mccandless himself was interesting to read while after he died the story tailed off and it was hard to keep my attention on the initial story at hand. i felt that the personal experiences and stories of people that didn't really apply to mccandless himself was kind of bland and uninteresting to read. at least krakauer could have put his experince at the beginning of the book so the reader would know about the authors opinion before he started reading the book. i believe that the story about chris himself was very interesting and the story was written real well. i felt as thought the author had done a fine job of research before the book was written.
3,unnecessary inserts take away from the McCandless story,"I thought that 'Into the Wild' by Krakauer was a very well researched and well written book. I like to hear about the journeys of Mcanddles however, I thought that the inserts about other men like Chris were unnecessary and took away from the actual story. Right when the story was getting really good and interesting all of the sudden there were these 3 chapters about other people making journeys like Chris. I just didn't feel that the placement of these 3 chapters was a good choice, they took your mind off the actual story and didn't really have alot of relevence to what was going on. Other than that I really enjoyed the book and though it was pretty well written."
3,I book that leaves you thinking,"This book is very confusing. Since Krakauer didn't know all the facts and to a point took Chris's side, I think that he was partial to him since he was a mountain man. My opinion is on the up side, it is a story of a man trying to find his way in life by doing things his way. But if you look at it logically, he had his whole life ahead of him and didn't need to do unnessary risks to prove a point. I think that it is about a lost little boy that never wanted to be found."
4,Insightful and inspiring,"The story of how Chris became Alex is very deep and interesting. Since it is a true story, it is amazing that he actually does some of the stuff that he did. I know very few people who could do these sort of things. Krakuer did some great research to find the trail of a man who didn't want to be found, so it was well written. Some slow parts are when he talks about other people, and when he talks about himself. Anybody on their own would be able to identify with Chris, and I admire his independence."
4,"Philosophical, inspiring, yet saddening at the same time","The book was very well pulled together. Many people can see parallels between Chris' life and their own. Sometimes you just get tired of people, and want to escape life's pressures."
4,Interesting mix of first and third-person exploration.,"_Into the Wild_ is a good read, but frustrating. It is partconfession, part narrative, and part meditation on whatmotivates people-- generally young men-- to makehigh risk journeys. Krakauer is at his best when he isable to suspend rumination, and make the imaginative leapinto the queer, bright, grandiose mind of Chris McCandless,who starved to death in Alaska after choosing to neglectalmost every common sense measure for wilderness survival.Krakauer's own autobiographical chapters illuminate his ownlong entanglement with risk, but tend to break up the mainstory. As with Krakauer's articles in _Outside_ magazine,I wished for a strong editor, and one good rewrite."
1,Read the OUTSIDE Article Instead,"I just finished this book even though it's been on my shelf for years. Unfortunately, I found this to be one of the worst books I've read in a while. First off, the story of Chris and his life is extremely skimpy--basically, he was excruciatingly average. Therefore, the author pads the story with entire chapters about himself! Secondly, the writing is atrocious. Krakauer creates whole passages of melodrama, too ridiculous to cite here. Finally, my biggest problem with the book was the lack of conclusions it draws: ""Was Chris nuts? Was he sane? No one will ever know..."" erases all the previous efforts the author described to get to the 'soul' of this young man. Bottom line for those curious about Chris and his travels is to look for the OUTSIDE magazine article about him because it offers as much info as the book does and is a lot cheaper and quicker to read."
2,disappearance of a young man,i gave this a 2 rating because i felt the author tried to take his very good newspaper/magazine article and expand it a bit too much into a novel. at times this book went to places that really never held my interest.
2,Irritating and disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this book. If you take away all of the pages of text detailing what Chris M. *might have been thinking* or *might have done* you are left with little more than what you could learn from newspaper accounts of his mysterious disappearance and untimely death, and it is obvious that this story should never have amounted to more than a magazine article. I found the author's writing style (bizarre vocabulary choices that just looked like he was showing off) very annoying at times"
3,Just so-so,"I found this book only mildly interesting. Krakauer obviously shares McCandless's fantasy of being a wanderer and a drifter, but the difference is that McCandless's arrogance led him to be a bit delusional. Anyone who would wander into the tough Alaskan wilderness without proper provisions or an emergency backup plan must be a little crazy."
3,Into the Wild,This is a good book but is not really my type of book. There is too much sadness in it.
3,into the wild,"The book starts off pretty slowly. In the beginning, Chris is on an adventure. He hictchikes most of the way to his destination. On the way to his destination, he meets many people. Most, if not all, are deeply impacted by the encounter with Chris. He keeps a journal of his adventure and travels to many places. This story will make you think twice about nature and how you live your life."
2,Quick and easy read,"I picked up this book because my husband was reading it. It had an interesting story, but I couldn't help thinking the only reason it was being written was because the kid died. There is nothing particularly great about the story. I was very irritated on all the side stories (including the author, talking about himself) within the book, which didn't add anything except pages in an already thin book. Outdoorsy people may like this book, but unless you like reading about how people get themselves killed by being overconfident, skip this one."
1,one long walk for man kind.,"Into the wild by Jon Krakaure is an adventurous. Chris Mcandless is a man who gave up everything; I mean everything just to get away from all the problems of life around him. His whole journey is just him and the people he meets on the way to Alaska. All he has for survival is a .22 caliber rifle, rice, and a backpack with simple gear in it to survive with. His whole journey is to make it to Alaska and live off the land it has to offer. But when Mother Nature hits him hard the cold climate takes his life in a bus out on the stampede trail. And all the amazing people he met on his two year journey to Alaska will remember Chris and what a good-hearted person he was."
1,This book is really boring!!!,I had to read this book for class and i read the first couple chapters and they were good(Chis in Alaska). But after he dies the book is just horrible. I'm keep asking myself how could such a dull book be rated 5 stars let a lone be a bestseller.
4,not what I was expecting,"but great anyway.I saw the movie first and I didnt know anything about Alex's story, so it was a good surprise. the writer shares his how experiences and shows Alex's story as viewed by all sorts of people.Its a good book that went on to make an amazing movie."
3,Sad story,"I thought this book was very interesting, but very sad at the same time. The boy had so much courage and was very smart. Good read for non-fiction."
1,Krakauer is a Whiner,"I read this book a while ago. I really enjoyed Into Thin Air, but this was an overly long boring whiney account by Krakauer. Definitely not worth reading."
1,Into the whining,"Anyone who likes this book has not read it. Krakauer spends more time whining about his troubled relationship with his own father, and complaining that Jack London was an overweight city slicker, than he does addressing the story of a young man who was extremely interesting. If you have seen the episode of Millenium about this, or saw it on 48 Hours, you will have gained more insight than Krakauer's incessant whining. To put it into perspective, when I saw the book, my wife (who had read the book) said I would be very disappointed. I was more than disappointed. The book is a complete waste of time to anyone but Krakauer's overtaxed therapist."
1,Wacko Sean Penn Strike another POS film,"Anybody that has been homeless BY CHOICE and watches this POS film knows right away that it is total BS from the start = TOO MANY RED FLAGS.Sean Penn is another WACKO of Hollywood that should climb into his 5 million dollar gold loony bus, park it in a RV park off the Vegas strip, and hide from humanity.The 2 hour and 15 minute movie played out under 35 minutes thanks to the fast forward button on the remote.The WORST film of 2007.Only a complete MORON would like this POS film.ZERO STARS"
1,Had to read for class...HATED it!!!,"I had to read this book for one of my college classes and it's one of the worst books that I've ever read. Who actually wants to read about a kid who takes a road trip by himself and ends up dead? Poorly wriiten, quite boring, though it's a good source if one needs to fall asleep. I actually thought about shredding it for fun..."
4,Into the Wild,Well written by a wonderful author. Riveting! A tragic but inspiring journey in descriptive narrative. What a brave young man -- a true adventurer.
4,"Thoughtful, well-written biography","Krakauer has always been a non-fiction writer with a style very heavily seeded in literature, as his powerful narration shows in this novel. The story of the main character is one of recklessness and youthful aspirations taken to an extreme degree, and yet Krakauer--using his strong narrative skills and personal experiences--makes it so easy to identify with the main subject.It's a short read, but well worth the trip.I haven't seen the movie yet, but I wonder how good it could possibly be without Krakauer's stirring narrative prose to provide the elaborate and stunning background information found in the book."
1,Boring,"I found the book and the person about whom the book is written to be moderately interesting some of the time and totally uninteresting most of the time. Apparently, the writer agrees with me since he dedicated eleven pages (pp. 134-144) in Chapter Thirteen to himself. The book is a magazine article that should have remained a magazine article. The story may have had enough ""stuff"" for an article but not for a book. The writer attempted, valiantly but unsuccessfully, to add substance to a story that is neither meaningful nor significant. Save the money. Don't purchase the book. Just read the dust jacket. Like some movie previews, it is more interesting than the complete story for which you are asked to pay."
1,Short story with lots of filler.,"The main story is a good one and deserved to be told. However, the book is padded with so many other tangents to fill out the covers that it pissed me off. I found myself wondering when would we get back to the subject and why is he telling me about all these other people who have nothing to do with the storyline. I'll tell you why...because the story about the main character is, at best, a short story. Hope the movie is better."
2,Unlike any other book I've ever read.,"I found the book to be somewhat interesting, but I do not agree with McCandless' ideas about life. Throwing away all your possessions and marching off into the wilderness unprepared is just plain foolishness, and from the other examples that Krakauer cited, usually ends in death. How fruitless is that? Although it is interesting to learn about McCandless' adventures via Krakauer's book, it would've been better to learn about it from McCandless himself, had he been more prepared to walk into the Alaskan interior and survive to walk out again."
4,Very good jornalistic writing !!,"In my opinion, the history of McCandless tells only one thing: he was a basket case. Completely lost. I don't care about what were his ideas, his dreams. You just don't throw your life away, like he did, with no reason at all. It's not right! But Krakauer job is another history. He wrote a well reserched book, full of details and great sensibility. Very good reading."
3,"A very good read, but not probing enough","It's sometimes hard to divorce author from subject, and part of the reason I give this book 3 stars is because ""Alex Supertramp"" was a self-infatuated, self-important kid who never grew up and is notably only for his tremendous lack of perspective and his incredible hubris. The book is well written and I would recommend it. I identify with Chris (aka Alex) because I sort of had similar feelings of wanting to flee and just walk to Alaska when I was younger. The author fails to really understand Chris as he is: An essentially shallow, self-aggrandizing kid who has some fun adventures and then kills himself with stupidity. Chris's behavior is well worth exploring, but the author takes him way too seriously and almost seems to share Chris's fantasy that he is something special and superior, instead of deeply confused and muddy-headed."
5,A moving tribute to a unique man,"I'll be honest, at the begining of this book I thought, ""He's an idiot and he got what was coming to him."" However as I read the depth of Chris' character and the precision of Krakauer's narrative drew me into Mcandless'life. John Krakauer turned a cautionary tale into a triumph of human percevierence and the compexity of our character."
3,So What?!,"""Alexander Supertramp"" disdains his wealthy and secretive family and sets off to Alaska to shed them like so much snake skin. At the conclusion of the book, one cares as much about Christopher McCandless as the common garter variety. This story of teenage angst and invinciblilty leaves the reader non plused. An exceptionl magazine article in Outdoor becomes a drawn-out, cathartic writing by Krakauer. Download the article from Outdoor's archives and you will be very pleased"
4,What is man looking for when he goes into the wild?,"What is man really looking to find when he goes up against thebrute, unforgiving forces of nature? Into the Wild does a great jobexplaining why one must venture out into the great outdoors to come face to face with his true self. It's a great story, and because the author has first-hand experience similar to that of Chris McCandless, his writing has a special empathy that cannot be affected. As someone who has lived in New York City for several years, I found this read almost as refreshing and head-clearing as a real trip into the wild."
4,Boy Lost,"Krakauer has written a neat little book for the parents of young men.There have always been post adolescent boys too smart and too intelligent to live in modern society without somekind of cathartic journey to define their inner self. Chris, the subject of Mr. KrakauerÍs attention, is specifically that kind of young man; he rejects his past and starts his journey towards his own personal Siddartha. Jon, Chris and I and everyman I now know have all done this; most of the time we go to College, or join th"
3,At a loss?,"I know many will say I'm copping out but I can't help it. Half of me thinks it is great that he tried to live independant of the modern world around him and he survived as long as he did. But on the other hand, as intelligent as he was he should have known better then to go in the alaskan wilderness without some basic life saving skills and equipment. it is very well written, although the pictures he took while on his trips would have been great were they included in this book. At this point I still don't know what to think. If he were mentally ill then it would explain things a lot better, but according to the book he wasn't. Maybe at least it will provide others who decide to take on nature to be better prepared."
3,"Interesting story, could have skipped it","The author writes this story as a good ""mystery"" -- trying to analyze Chris McCandless to see what drove him. Overall, I think he did a good job. I just couldn't identify enough with either Chris or the author to get much out of this book, other than it's a tragic and interesting story."
4,Display of intense courage to be respected,"I really enjoyed reading this book and could relate to McCandless's story. I admired his courage to step out of a set and expected plan for his life. He wanted to challenge himself as to whether he was strong enough and possessed enough desire to leave society and face his true self and surroundings in nature. Some think he is foolish because he gave up money and what is viewed as the ""good life"", but what makes one person happy doesn't necessarily apply to the next. Society is so focused on money and technology and it was a huge step for McCandless to turn his back to that in exchange for what he truly loved. I don't think he should be criticized or called crazy simply because he wanted to explore what many people never find in their lives: the power and beauty of nature and the strength and independence within himself."
2,"Um, Interesting, I Guess","Well, this book is different, I guess. My 6th grade teacher made me read it, along with many other books. I don't think that that the character deserves to be glorified. He had no respect for his family, his life, and the wilderness. He actually believed that he and a bag of rice could brave the Alaskan wilderness. As always, the wilderness overcame. He got what he deserved. The best part was the little paragraph on the back cover about the author, because I couldn't wait to get there. The book was very slow. There was a lot of gobbely-gook, and the writing was nothing special. I would recomend this to someone who has read every other book on earth."
2,"Better to burn out, than fade away?","Rich kid finishes college; decides there is dignity in leading a simple life off the land; crashes around the USA for a couple of years living off the kindness of strangers; heads to Alaska; dies.Krakauer wants us to find some meaning in this. I am not sure that there is much to be learned, and I don't think that Christopher Johnson McCandless found any more dignity from dying young in Alaska, than he would have achieved from staying alive in Virginia."
4,Captivating story,Curiosity relating to McCandless' adventures led to several reads. Enjoyed the history and author's personal journeys. Interesting. Worthwhile reading for many.
3,Society does not make McCandless's.,"The book deals with people who have this idealism that society is devastating and regulating. I do not agree with this thinking. People decide what society is like not society what people are like. McCandless' dream is ultimately going to Alaska and surviving without any help except bare essentionals. Why does he run away from the world? This makes the illusion that he is crazy, but I doubt that. He tends to be caught up in the stories written by some of his favorite authors about going back to nature. Society does not condone abandonment from them to another very well. Therefore this makes McCandless' experience with nature unrelatable. Society is not the root of evil."
2,A major disappointment,"This is a story about the bungled life of a self-absorbed adolescent who during his twenty-four years seems to have contributed little other than causing pain to his family and friends. The author, however, who seems to be cut from the same cloth, apparently appreciates the Supertramps misadventures. Save for the peculiar circumstances of McCandless' demise, this is an all too familiar story of the irresponsible escapades of (some of) today's youth. The ""story "" could have been told in twenty pages. Don't waste your time"
5,Into the Wild,This is a good truestory about a young man's confusion and the the sad end.It makes you think how could it be possible to avoid this kind of tragediesI recommend.
2,Truly depressing,"After ""Into thin air"" by Jon I was tempted to read this book. It is a sad story about a sad and weird man that leaves behind just sadness."
2,INTO THE WILD,Really didn't like the subject matter. Plan on giving this book to some else who likes to read. Not my subject
2,No Text to Speech,"Got the book today for my kindle fire HD by ""one-click"". Too disappointed that the text-to-speech doesn't work. That's the best feature of Fire HD. The book is hard to read, with unfamiliar names, places and vocabs. Having text-to-speech would really help. Returned for refund quickly. I'm fascinated by the story. Will definitely buy it if Text to Speech is available!"
4,Into the Wild paperback,"My 9th grader chose as one of his ""optional"" summer reading books. I read ""Into Thin Air"" years ago, so liking Krakauer, gave this one a try. Good, quick, easy read. Well done Jon!"
4,Into the Wild,Ordered for high school summer reading assignment for two of my boys. They enjoyed it well enough.I was impressed with how fast it arrived after I ordered it.
5,Into the Wild,"Great book. I didn't like that the author dips into his past about how he relates to Chris for a couple chapters. Other than that, I thought it was great and informative."
3,What to say about this book...?,"The story drew me in, as it probably does to many. In the end, the unanswered questions are what kept me from giving this book a better rating. I understand that there are a lot of conjectures about McCandless, and that they can't be answered because he is dead, but that doesn't make me any less disappointed.I think that Krakauer did a decent job of telling McCandless's story, and I agree with many of the conclusions he came to. The only real issue I had with this book was that it seemed to have a lot of ""filler pages"". Krakauer would spend pages and pages talking about one theory, only to turn around and refute it with what he actually believed happened. To me, when he did this it felt as if he was just trying to make the book longer and not actually presenting any worthwhile information."
3,Into the Wild,"Stacey FredricksonEarth Science HonorsBlock GInto the WildBy: Jon KrakauerInto the Wild is and interesting book. It really opens your eyes to living in the wilderness. All of the people mentioned in this book chose to live with no designated shelter, little or no food, and no way to communicate. This book does an excellent job explaining how it is ok to go live in the wilderness, but you should plan your trip perfectly. Bring enough food, know the land that your staying on, and have an effective way to communicate. The main story, about Chris McCandless, is very sad. Dying alone in the Alaskan wilderness is no way to die. Dying alone in the wilderness is no way for anyone to die. Overall in to the wild was a good book. It is definitely worth reading, if you are into books about Alaska or surviving in the wilderness."
2,"Well... not what its ""krauk""ed up to be","MY English teacher loved this book... but i do not see why.I believed that the story line was good, interesting enough to follow (and it helped it was real.)I thought Kraukauer did not do a good job writing it. He did do a good job with McCandless's story, but he veered off him in EVERY single way he possibly could. I can see why he related all the other stories to McCandless's, but i thought there was just too many other stories. He even found a way to put HIMSELF into the book (what a biography. half biography and half auto.)I thought it was ok, but not great."
2,Into the Land of Arrogance,"I saw the movie before I read either book about Chris Mccandless. I was moved by the movie, both by Chris' spirit and determination. I did not like this book at all. I felt that the author ridiculed Mccandless' journey, and probably caused a lot of grief for his family, the way he called him ignorant. I really did not like how it was a book that was supposed to be about Mccandless, and more than 3/4 of the bookare about the author's own experiences, and how he feels he's better than Mccandless. It oozed with arrogance, and it angered me that the author had no problem tarnishing the good memories people had of Mccandless. but then the author goes on to brag about his own adventures, and how he was/is better than Mccandless.I would recommened this book for people who did not like the movie. If you loved the movie like I did, please read the original book. It stays truer than this rag did."
2,Ridiculous,"This book is about one of the dumbest blokes I have ever heard of. He wants to be all ""Walden"" or out there. Althought the whole time it rants about him leaving all the comforts of ""normal"" society behind, he relies on quickie marts to get his drinking water and puts it in a mass produced milk jug. Not only is kid a complete hypocrite, but he is a foolish boy who hasnt yet grown up. It honestly is a book about a complete fool. Somehow he has been glorified, because of his idiocy. I just don't buy it.Why did I give it 2 stars? Because it was entertaining reading about how utterly ignorant this kid was."
3,Where McCandless Went,"Into The Wild is based on a true story about a man named Chris McCandless. Chris is in his twenties, and he loves the outdoors. He wants to get away from everything and he goes to the Alaskan Wilderness to do that. He left Alanta, didn't say a word to his parents, and headed west to his ultimate goal, Alaska. He had an old yellow Datsun and he drove that to the Detrital Wash in Arizona. He lost his car in a flash flood there and was forced to hitch hike. He eventually made it to Fairbasnks Alaska and from there hitched a ride to the Stampede Trail near a city called Healy. He crossed two calm rivers not knowing they would flood with water from melting ice and be uncrossable. He found an abandoned bus and from there made his camp. He really lived off the land, shooting game and foraging for berries. He got weaker and never noticed how near he was to civilization, only 6 miles."
2,Krakauer really knows how to bore!,"In ""Into the Wild,"" Krakauer tries to delve into the minds of really bland, plainly foolish people. Even if he were remotely successful (which he wasn't), why would anyone care about someone who wants to wonder around the country and live a nomadic existance. This book simply lists boring events. DON'T BOTHER."
5,Into the Wild,"this is the story of chris mccandles. candles inherits money, then lights it on fire out of principle. he then travels the country excoriating people for not doing the same. in between stints working at mcdonalds, he ventures off into the wild with nothing but a gun and fishing pole. after almost dying repeatedly, he decides alaska is the only wilderness tough enough for him. he walks down a trail off the highway, wades across a stream, then starts writing a journal. he gets hungry and decides to go back, but is blocked by the ice-melt swollen stream. not realizing that getting upriver to a crossing point is now a matter of life or death, he goes back to his campground. something very bad then happens to him and he can't get out. the best parts of the book are the several chilling accounts of how seemingly innocuous mistakes cost some very tough people their lives all alone in the wilderness. the author will make you feel like you're about to die, that's how well written it is."
1,ew......,"this is not even a book, its so hard to understand and there at least 20 different people that are focused on, this is just a huge essay, DONT GET IT!!"
4,"Decent book, but kind of meandering...","This is worth the read if you are into the outdoors and/or like true stories. The first half of the book traces events leading up to Chris'(AKA Alex)travels prior to his fateful trip through the Alaskan wilderness. You can see that Alex was challenging fate many times by making many mistakes along the way. Was it youth, was it a death-wish? I think he just thought what alot of people think... that bad things happen to other people, but it's not going to happen to me. If you read this book and then read Deep Survial (I read them in reverse) then you will see how misfortunes like Alex's occur.If you are into the outdoors and participate in extreme sports, I also suggest you also try Deep Survival by Laurence Gonzales. Touching the Void is also good (I only saw the DVD though and have not read the book it was based on)."
1,The guy was an idiot,"I don't understand why so many people are celebrating the stupidity of Christopher McCandless. While I understand his goal, to live an untethered life, the idiotic way he went about it is mindboggling and what is even more confusing then that is people are making him out to be some kind of great man. Chris is not a great man or even avid explorer, Chris was just another unprepared, undereducated person whose ignorance lead to his demise."
2,What was he thinking?,"Seriously, all I could think while reading this book was that the guy was an idiot. I had such high hopes after reading Into Thin Air and I was so very disappointed."
1,Boring,"I feel the same as one of the other reviewers; why summarize the story on the cover and tell me what happens?I couldn't get to the end of this book, to be honest, I couldn't even read past page 55ish. I tried, I kept reading as much as I could and as far as I could, but this book isn't worth my time.I will not finish the book regardless of how strongly I feel about finishing everything I start. And, I would never recommend this book to anyone."
1,Not much here,"There isn't much of a story here. A Pilgrim goes into the Wilderness totally unprepared and dies of starvation / food poisoning. Not in the same league as ""Shattered Air"" by the same author. The author has to really stretch the material to make 224 pages out of it. I haven't seen the movie, but considering the known facts, it is likely to be mostly fiction."
5,Into the Wild,"I actually bought the book because I work at school and the kids in my American Literature class were reading the book, so I bought it so I could have it on my kindle. The book is well written and made for great classroom discussions. Krakauer did a great job. The kids seemed to enjoy the book also."
4,A very odd start. yet a amazing finish,"At first you might think that it is kind of odd how to book starts off (dont worry no spoliers will be put in this review, only things that you learn from the free sample will i talk about}. If you enjoyed the book hatchet (a very popular book assignied to kids in middle school now adays) then you will love into the wild. its simply a great book. although right at the begginning you learn that the main character dies , it just makes you even more interestred in knowing what happens to them. you might find at times it gets kind of boring but that quickly passes as they have to add alot of details to make the story really flow. all in all its a great book. i loved it. i only gave it a 4 star however becasue of how u know as soon as u start that the main charcter will die, which for me was a bit of a downer.happy reading!"
2,Not an interesting read,"Krakauer obviously thought that his Outside magazine article on Chris McCandless would make him a few more bucks published as a book.In a nutshell: An idealistic, nave young college graduate who has neither survival training nor any practical experience in the outdoors rejects his comfortable middle-class upbringing, gives all his savings to charity, re-christens himself with a new BS name (Alexander Supertramp), and after wandering around out West for a while hitchhikes to Alaska, hikes into the Alaskan wilderness alone and starves to death.Not really worth your time to read. Krakauer's other book, Into Thin Air, is far better."
3,Mesmerizing... yet tragic.,"I read this book and was totally fascinated. This book to me, is an allegory for the fallenness of the world. I do not believe the author ever intended this conclusion. However, one cannot read this from a Christian perspective and not feel pity for this talented man who never really found what he was looking for. No matter how great his resignation at the end, I feel Chris' fervor was misplaced and his potential unused. What a tragedy."
1,This book does not work,This was the type of book that makes me want to wach paint dry. It drowns on about a self-absorbed CHILD. That he went into something with alomost no idea what he was doing. This was the type of person that would have got lost in a closet. The writing was like a bad news article from a tabloid. It glorified a sad ture story of someone that was vastly unpreppared for what they were doing.
1,Very unfulfilling!,"I could never understand why Chris was making this journey. You have a kid who died trying to make a point about what? Humans can survive without necessary evils? Pointless! People starve everyday in America, what makes ""Supertramp"" so different?"
1,McCandless was a very selfess towards his life.,"I feel that McCandless was a very selfess person. He made people fall in love with him and then left them high and dry with only a couple of letters before his death. Did he not realize the hurt he was causing other people by risking his life? Did he not understand how important and special life is? He seemed to only care about his own feelings about his life and not how others were emotionly attached to his. Since he knew how much he was risking his life, he shouldn't of gotten everyone so emotionally attached to him. Others cared for his feelings so they let him go on with life like he wanted to, so shouldn't he of cared for their fellings back and not ended his life so rudely like he did."
5,Krakauer explores the dissatisfaction of youth,"When I first began reading Into the Wild I was puzzled. I wondered why so much of the book's ending was revealed in the first chapter. But as I started to really get into the book I realized that the book was not only about the fact that Chris McCandless died, but it was about a whole expierience. The book explored the relationships that he made on his voyage, and the factors that led to its tragic end. You find yourself thinking along with the author trying to piece together what inspired a young man to put himself at such a risk and why he left people's lives so quickly after establishing lasting connections. It seems that ultimately McCandless was dissatisfied with every day life and set out on his trip because of this. John Krakauer is a master at presenting a comepletely factual story. His insights into the people are outstanding. I recommend this story to anyone who has intrest in it."
2,All Mixed Up,"I found this book to be intriging yet confusing at the same time. I felt that the way Krakauer organized the information was very jumpy and made the book difficult to understand. Krakauer also included a lot of pointless information about other people that had gone out on adventures and never came back. I feel that took away from the whole point of the book which I thought was supposed to be about Chris McCandless. If Krakauer would have stayed focused on the life of McCandless, I feel the book would have been more effective."
3,"A good book, but too much junk.","I felt that a story like this would have been better told under a format of fiction. (""Based on a true story."") For an author to try to understand the thoughts and motives of someone who died alone in the wilderness is impossible. Also, Krakauer takes the reader too far away from the main story several times. He spends several paragraphs and even chapters telling the reader about his background and the background of the people McCandless came in contact with. None of this information is vital to understanding the motives of McCandless, which is what I understood to be the whole point of the book. As a documentary, this book is very well researched and written. Jared P."
4,Krakauer Does it Well,"Jon Krakauer's books are well written and researched. In Into the Wild, he has taken a complex true journey and handled it in a straight forward, thoughtful way. One is drawn into the story and held by suspense and a need to determine the psychological make-up and motivation of the subject. In the end, we are enriched by practical information and the sense that we too have made a journey of sorts."
5,A story well told,"This book started out as a short story for Outside Magazine, but Jon's zeal as a writer drove him onward and it became a classic book. The story is a true and sad tale of a young lad searching for his soul, and Jon has done a great job of portraying his plight. I found this book to be very enjoyable reading, and the movie was excellent. Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
5,Just can't turn away - or put down,"I loved this book, it sort of reminded of In Cold Blood - or did it say that on the dust jacket? Either way it did remind me of that. You know the ""what"" but were waiting for the ""why"" - which like in Capote's novel is never answered fully. Fascinating really, but in a car wreck kind of way."
4,Into the wild,This book was a excellent true account of a boy who did not like the human society. I liked the fact that Krakaur interviewed all those people who Chris/Alex came in contact with. It was an exellent accout of a young man who wanted nothing but an adventure in Alaska. Krakaur spents his time in this book defending Chris as not bieng suicidal. He believes that Chris went in the wild with the intention of never comming back but he did have the intention of surviving out there. It was a tragity that he died apparently before his pilgrage in a way was finished. He had the heart and potential to survive and it was very unfortunate that he did not survive.
3,The second time,"I first read ""Into the Wild"" when it came out in paperback in 1997. I remember not being all that impressed with the book then and did not think it deserved all the hype it got at the time. With the Sean Penn movie based on the book set to come out I decided to read the book again. My opinion of the book hasn't changed over the last ten years. I still don't see why the story caused such a sensation because Chris McCandless is such an unlikable character and his travels don't seem all that unusual to me. Krakauer tries and tries to attach some deeper meaning to the story, but I just fail to grasp it. On the positive side Krakauer is an outstanding writer and his descriptions of the landscapes and various characters in the book are excellent. I will be interested to see the movie because I don't know how they will manage to make it interesting."
4,A nice quick read....,"I bought this book because it was here at Amazon, and it caught my eye. I was able to read the book in about 2 days.I find the book really interesting, I don't like ruining anything, but its basically a young man who had a good upbringing, but it just wasn't his world. He left everything to find his happiness, and that he found.In certain parts of the book, it can be long-winded with all the comparisons made to other people. In essence, it helps us know our main character better, but sometimes, I just wanted to skip a couple of pages. (Which I didn't)So all in all. If you want a good story, which will be coming to movies shortly, this is a good read. Ha, and don't pay full price for it, you can get a cheap one here on Amazon."
4,A deeply satisfying story of individual trials and triumphs,"In this book, the author goes to great pains to recount the last few years of McCandless' life. It is particularly spellbinding how this man searches the nation and eventually goes into the wilds of Alaska to find himself or some semblence of real truth. It is masterfully written, partly as one accompanying McCandless, partly as one searching with Krakauer for the mysteries of his life up to his death in central alaska. It is a story that many avid outdoorsmen (or women) will identify with as it goes to the ends of the earth and describes the same inexplicable motives we have for journeying into the wild."
5,A great book!!!,After enjoying Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer I decided to read Into the Wild which I had also heard was good. Into the Wild did turn out to be a fabulous book; even better than Into Thin Air in my opinion. Krakauer gave a great insight into the decesion making-process of this young man. Though it was not always a page-turner in the normal sense of the word it was very addicting and I ended up reading it all on a trans-continental flight. Enjoy reading!!!
2,"Disapointing and rambling, with a few great moments","If you liked ""Into Thin Air"" this book is worth a try, but it is not nearly as cohesive, spectacular, or absorbing. Krakauer feels the need to reiterate the dramatic far too frequently... ""McCandless was a smart kid, but not smart enough for the tough Alaskan wilderness."" Most of the book is filler, stories culled about other failed solo expeditions, and even a self-aggrandizing chapter about the author's own ascent of an Alaskan peak."
5,"A must read for anyone considering walking ""Into the Wild""","I can understand why Chris McCandless turned away from his parents. I can understand why he wanted to be his own person and live off the land. But to go off into the wilderness of Alaska so unprepared was not the thinking of a rational person. How could someone so smart, have been so stupid?"
3,Kind of moot...,"The premise of the work is good (shedding light on the psyche of a young man who has turned his back on society) and Krakauer does a reasonable job of recreating Chris' (the young man) travels and state of mind from interviews and writings.Roughly one quarter of the book consists of a mini Jon Krakauer autobiography and biographies of other ""explorers"". Personally, I don't think this really detracts from the overall work, but some readers may argue otherwise.The problem with the work is that the whole story is really blunted in the end when it is revealed that Chris didn't really just give up on life, but appears to have died accidentally."
3,Fascinating,"Chris McCandless was admirable in a lot of ways--he had the cajones to do what many people dream of but few people do. He did not die because he was ill-prepared (don't forget he managed to live for 3 months+), he died because he lived the way he wanted and took the risks he needed to take. I'm glad our society can still produce people like him, and not just Backstreet Boys fans . The only fault I find with him is the worry he put him family through.""Into The Wild"" is well done, unfortunately even at 200 pages it seems padded. The author adds chapters on other wayward dreamers, which were interesting, and his own youth, which was not. The book is worth reading, but there just isn't much to it."
3,"Intriguing, yet depressing","It was an interesting read, yet it leaves you almost depressed at the end. A bright young man chooses to flirt with death by venturing out into the wilderness with little survival gear. It was a good book, but probably not one I'd read again."
4,A good adventure story for a night of light reading.,"Jon Krakauer is a tried and true adventure/outdoor writer. If you like this genre, this is an entertaining read. The book is certainly not conclusive, and there are passages that some may construe as ""fill""....stories of other perhaps misled wanderers are added because, in the end, there is no answer as to why Chris McCandless did what he did. But I enjoyed reading about John Muir and the other oddballs that drifted in and out of the narrative. I do think this book has an agenda, especially towards the end when Mr. Krakauer compares his own climb of a mountain in Alaska to McCandless' quest, but the agenda gives the book a point of view that perhaps is needed. The boy remains a mystery, Jon Krakauer doesn't resolve it, but so what? Think what you will, at least it will make you think. And, I may be prejudiced also, living in the Pacific Northwest and knowing all too many people who are the similar to the characters that populate ""Into The Wild""."
5,an incredible book on the need for rite of passage for men,"an inspiring look at a young man's search for meaning in life. although he died, his life was not wasted. it's a must read for anyone who is thoughtful and introspective. made me cry."
3,Not the best book I've read,"Jon Krakauer's book Into The Wild wasn't bad but not one I couldn't put down. The reason for this is because I don't really like Chris McCandless. I can relate to him in the fact that he wanted his freedom and to experience life to the fullest in nature, but he used that as an excuse to run away from his problems at home and with his father. Through the book he didn't really follow his ideals that he clames he holds so dear. In the begginning he gave his money to charity, ditched he car, and burned his cash. But later he gets a job and then goes out into the deasert by himself the comes back to society and gets another job and opens a bank account. By then end Chris gets really cocky and believes that he can survive anything and dosn't take the advice of other more experienced people such as the man who gave him a ride to Stampede Trail."
4,A moving portrait of a frustrating man,"Into the Wild tells the story of Chris ""Alex Supertramp"" McCandless, and it's a fascinating story. Throughout the book, I felt a sort of tension - on the one hand, I admired McCandless's idealism and intelligence. But at the same time, he struck me as incredibly arrogant, reckless, and unaware (or unconcerned) about how his actions affected other people - especially his own family. At two points, I found myself absolutely furious with McCandless - first, when he deliberately tries to hurt his parents by cutting them out of his life, and secondly when his recklessness and foolish advice end up essentially ruining the life of Ronald Franz, a lonely old man who befriended McCandless.Despite my anger, I couldn't help but be interested in McCandless's story. He was an intelligent, charismatic, and fascinating person - but he was also an incredibly furstrating and infuriating person. That tenion makes Into the Wild an engrossing read."
3,"Elusive in Life, Elusive in Death","The book began as an article in Outdoor Magazine and Krakauer expanded the tight-deadline article into this work. It is well-written, often moving, and fascinating as it veers into Krakauer's own solo climbing in Alaska. For all Krakauer's efforts, however, Chris McCandless remains just as elusive in death as he was in life. Simply put, maybe he just didn't leave enough clues or enough witnesses in his two year hegira which ended in the abandoned bus in Alaska. Krakauer's done his research, the tales of others similar to McCandless are fascinating, and as a parent of similar aged kids this is a painful read for their loss. Still, I finally conclude that the book does not add a great deal to the barren eloquence of the Outdoor article based on McCandless' own small diary kept as his fate closed in on him."
1,"Why was this book written, let alone published?","A tragedy, yes. A smart kid with many problems. But what do we learn from this? What insights do we achieve? Simply a kid who in his arrogance and because of his inability to address the real issues in his life ""flew too close to the sun"" and died tragically. Unfortunately, this happens all too often. Krakauer is an extremely gifted writer, but his talents need to be focused elsewhere."
3,ho hum,Interesting story about a off-his-rocker young man who goes off into the wild and starves to death. There I just saved you from having to read it.
3,No comment now.,"In the begin of this semester, our teacher strongly suggest us to read this story, so I will do that later."
2,reader from ny,"I guess I expected the book to follow the journey of the doomed main character, Chris McCandless, but a large portion covers the adventures of the author and other stories.The paperback version is very thin even with the author's introspective ramblings included. The story was originally reported as a magazine article and probably should have stayed that way.If you are looking for a non-fictional adventure story,keep looking."
3,"Informative, but boring","I expected a different type of book. This is more like a documentary than a fun story. If you're looking for a character analysis or historical facts about the case, then this is a good book. It's just not what I expected."
4,"Good story, left me happy and sad at the same time.","When I started this book, I was not happy with the way Chris walked out on his family. I understand why he wanted to do what he did and I am glad that he got to experience what he wanted. As a mother I couldn't help but carry that anger towards him through-out the book. When I finally got to the end of the book, it really got to me. I don't want to give it all away, so I will stop here. It is worth reading. I watched the movie after I finished the book. I really wish they would of stuck to the book and stressed how the people he met told him to call his parents and to be more prepared. We all wish we could do something like this, but in the end we need family and friends, when it was to late I think Chris realized this."
1,Sorry Jon; but this one was no good!!,Seemed that there was not enough of a story to have a book written about this young man's death.
2,skip this one,"I am an avid adventure story reader. I was looking forward to hearing about Alaska and living on the land, instead this book is about a young idealistic man who is pitiful. I was disappointed to hear of this person's total disregard for the forces of nature who actually allowed himself to starve and perish through his own non efforts. Everyone dreams of an adventure,luckily most of us are more realistic in pursuing it. I could not even finish this book."
2,Just Okay,"Interesting for the most part -- I liked reading about McCandless's life, his younger years and family life, but the long chapters about Alaska, rock climbing and Krakauer's experiences were long and boring. I was happy to get to the Epilogue -- finally."
2,Not that great,I enjoyed reading Into Thin Air but this book felt slow and simply depressing. This failed to capture my imagination and had too many tangents that felt like page fillers.
2,Just didn't get the hype,"While reading this the same words kept popping into my head - why do I care? I kept waiting for the big ""ah-ha"" moment and it never appeared. I thought the book was choppy, the author was selfish for including his own story of his life and much of the book is just the author guessing what happened, where he went, and what he thought. I just didn't get it."
3,Pompous Writing Style,"When I came accross tnis book, I purchased it right away because it was written by the same author of Into Thin Air, one of my all time favorite books. However, I find his writing style pompous in this book.I sometimes use the dictionary anywhere from 0-6 times with each book. After using the dictionary countless times, I started highlighting examples to share with you.This story was interupted way too many times to look up 5 star words it disrupted the flow of the story for me. Here's a few example for you:disquietude anxietysobriquet nicknamepotting to shootrictus grininveigled persuadeanorectic anorexicopprobrium harsh criticismconvivial friendlyI do not recommend this book at all. I highly recommend Into Thin Air."
5,What a story!,I would recommend this book for high school students in an English class. It is has a tremendous depth and meaning.
4,Twisting,"I felt that Krakauer's ""Into the Wild"" left the reader twisted. Both longing to experience the freedom that McCandless, the focus of the book, felt. But it also leaves you with a longing for family connection, and the pain cause by the severience of those connections."
4,Leaves you thinking...,"Wow... I read this book in a single afternoon. In the beginning of the book I was thinking ""this Alex/Chris kid is a definite nutcase"". By the end of the book I was thinking that I too could take off to Alaska and spend some time there.The story is full of the beauty of life, of sad and pathetic irony, and of a tragic death. He led such an interesting life, and yet by the end of the book I still could not decide whether I thought he was crazy, arrogant, ignorant, or just out for adventure like the rest of us.A very good read."
5,Inspiration for a misguided generation,"The first time i read this book I was a traveling on a train, from Colorado to California. I didn't put the book down once and was finished before the Sierras were in sight. It provides insight in a young man's life, and his tragic death, and everything that inspired him in between. It's not a happy tale, nor a sad one. It makes you want to be great, and rarely in this day and age do we have the opportunity to think about, let alone accomplish, greatness. What else could you possibly want from a book?"
4,excellent book!,i found this book to be very thought provoking. its difficult not to feel a sense of closeness with mccandless. i highly recommend this book but the only thing i found disappointing were the chapters where krakauer described his own experiences. maybe i just wanted to hear more about mccandless but hey if youre into that kind of thing this is the book for you!
4,Capitvating tale of a lost soul,"Into the Wild is a tragedy. In this well-written tale, the author describes a young man who, in the end of a lonely journey, dies a very slow death alone. I think in the end he regretted his self-imposed situation. His mother describes waking from a vivid dream of Chris crying out to her. At that moment I believe he wanted help and wanted to be among the living."
5,A beautiful account,"When you can imagine and find simularities between your own life, and that of someone else's, then you know that a Rosetta Stone has been cast, not only in the language of our own personal experiences, but in the human factor of our culture."
2,Good and Bad,"I liked the book while first reading it, it was interesting reading at first. However because the author wanted to make the book longer, he starts filling it with a bunch of things that don't apply to the story. The several pages where the author describes his own mountain climbing was stupid and was like a commercial in the middle of a movie. It was also boring and I skimmed over it just to get back to the story. The story wasn't just about Chris dying in the wilderness, there were a few stories of others who died in the wilderness and then the author tries to compare them - which just did not work. But I did finish the book (aside from skimming over the author's mountain climbing experience)."
3,Truly brilliant or truly crazy?,"Krakauer does a good job of presenting the story of Chris McCandless, his life, his travels, and his death. I enjoyed the book for the most part but got a little bored with Krakauer's constant meandering from the actual story of McCandless to the stories of other men who made similar journeys. McCandless' story begs the question: was he mad or brilliant? There is no doubt that McCandless was a well-educated man who knew what he was doing; however, the true question of the story is that of his purpose. Did McCandless find true freedom? true happiness? We'll never know for sure, but we can read his story and learn from his mistakes thanks to Krakauer's thorough research. A good read if you can get through some of the slower parts."
4,Lost in the Wild,"This book shows an excellent illustration of a true, young man that comes from a well-off family facing his life after college. Jon takes you on a wild journey all across America, from Georgia to California to the Dakotas and to Alaska. It is a wonderful book, and falls a close second to one of the greatest books, Into Thin Air."
2,This book is not put together in a good way.,Jon Krakauer first start this book out really good I thought because he starts out tell that poeple fond Chris McCandless in a bus that was use by hunters. Then Jon goes on and tell you Chris's life story and how he end up in the bus in Alaska. If Jon want have stay will the stroy adout Chris and not throw in other stories that were like Chris. Then thing that really made this not a good book to read is that went he starts talk adout a other story like Chris and when he was done with and pick up with Chris life he talked about what he aready say in chapers before. This was not good because poeple like me who want to get back to Chris story and stay on it for the rest of the book. Then Krakauer when poeple to think of to because he put his one story in andput it up with Chris life. Have the story not in a row and have more then person story in to it made it a bad book. To make this book better is to tells Chris story then the other ones.
4,A very interesting book about a very interesting man,"I thought this book was very interesting. It takes a lot of guts to pack up and leave a very perfect life. Many people wish to do the very same thing but never get the courage to do so. McCandless wanted to be his own man and the only way he saw this happening was to start his life over, to become Alexander Supertramp. By changing his name he also changed his life, he became the person he always wanted to be. I liked how he got away from society and everything else that bothered him. He took control of his life the way most people are afraid to. I thought Krakauer did a very good job describing McCandless' life. The book details his journeys the best it can. The reader can get a good picture of what life was like for McCandless on the road and what it was like in Alaska the final months. I thought the book was written very well for what Krakauer had to work with."
3,What would have worked better for Jack Krakauer,"Jack Krakauer, does his best in describing the puropse and meaning of Chris McCandless's life in the book ""Into the Wild."" Jack Krakauer uses himself and other similar incidents to help his readers understand the young man's thoughts. Althougth we will never know what caused Chris McCandless to leave his wealth, college diploma, and loving family we discover some of his ideas and feelings through Krakauer's work. After reading ""Into the Wild,"" I feel that Krakauer could have done a better job of organizing the material that happened in Chris's journey. Jack placed similar experience of others at the end of a chapter without and reasonning why. This concept proved to be confusing when reading his book. I would have given this book a higher rating if there was more organization, and easier to follow."
4,Definitely a one-sitting read!,"Although I normally do not enjoy non-fiction wilderness books, I must admit I could not stop reading this one. I was moved by Chris McCandless and his selfless approach to life. He possessed the ability to live life the way he truly thought it should be lived, instead of falling prey to society's expectations as the rest of us often do. McCandless accomplished much more in his twenty-some years than many do in a lifetime. In addition to his high academic achievements, who else can say they donated their life savings to charity, survived soley by their own wit and by the generosity of others for two years? Krakauer did an excellent job portraying McCandless. He organized and told this tale in such a way that not only was I unable to put it down, but it forced me reevaluate my own life."
3,A good story but not a book,"I give Krakauer credit for not musing more then he did and sticking to the facts he was able to uncover. It was an interesting and sad story. I think McCandless was presented in a reasonably honest manner but did not understand his character so could sympathize with the parents. At some point you let go and hope. In this case McCandless was interesting, intelligent, charming but not world wise practical. There just wasn't enough here for an entire book, albeit short. The story was longer then a magazine article but to write a book meant including details in greater length then I thought necessary to appreciate the story. I would have enjoyed the book more if the author has filled the pages with some detail of Alaska and the trouble others encounter and how Alaskans deal with the wild."
4,Profoundly tragic,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? The only part of the book I didn't care for was Krakauer's interjections of his own experiences. I appreciate what he was trying to do but it didn't fit in with what he was trying to accomplish in this book. That being said the other 95% was excellent and very much worth reading. A part of me marvels at Chris's strength and determination but at the same time a part of me just wants to shake some sense into him. I guess there's nothing left to say except, ""tragic"".Coming in at a little over 200 pages it was a quick read. Very gripping."
5,A new Walden,"This is the true story of a young man who rejects modern society for the intense quest for true isolation and oneness with nature. Chris McCandless wandered into the harsh arctic wilderness unprepared and warned, and was found dead of starvation months later. Each chapter opens with powerful quotations from others who have been on this quest, like Thoreau, London, Muir and Dillard. This may be today's Walden and not soon forgotten."
2,Senior Term Paper in Disguise,"This book might have gotten an A as a highschool term paper which is how it reads. It was one of my least favorite books of the year. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, so I don't have any objections to Krakauer's take on Chris McCandless. My problem with the book was that the writing was so obvious and clumsy."
2,Into The Wild,"Into The wild by Jon Krakauer. A 22 year old man named Christopher Johnson McCandless left society to take a trip into the wilderness to which he would never return. He left his family, money, and most of his possessions to take this fatal adventure. The rest of the book tries to explain how he got this idea and how he persued it.The book was slow moving and became boring. If you are older and into the reasoning of people you might enjoy the book. The book did have some interesting points like christopher's home life and experiences on the road."
1,I don't get it,"I read this book standing up at a bookstore in Anchorage. ""That was a waste of time,"" I mumbled as I walked off to look at the magazines with pictures of pick-up trucks and hot LA senoritas. Why people think this book is a good one is beyond me. I guess I'd be more interested in the psychological problems of trust fund babies if I hadn't spent ten years selling them bicycles in California. Since Sean Penn made the movie I've read the book two more times, and I even bought a copy. I honestly don't see why anybody enjoys reading this lightweight piece of trash. I've heard the movie is great, so I'll buy the DVD one of these days. But the book is a quick read with, as far as I'm concerned, no redeemable qualities."
2,"Well written, but McCandless was an idiot","Basically, at this point I'm looking forward to the part where McCandless dies a miserable death because when you get right down to it, the guy was a douche. Krakauer does an admirable job of trying to explain why this dumbass did what he did, but underneath it all it's basically a story about a spoiled naive rich kid who was too stupid or too arrogant to plan properly for the task he undertook. Can't wait to reach the end of this book, because it'll be a good laugh, and who couldn't use a good laugh these days?"
1,Stretched to the point of breaking,"Simply put, there was just not enough relevant material to warrant a book. In order to fill out his original magazine article to book length, Krakauer takes bird-walk after circuitous bird-walk with mind-numbing redundancy. How often does one need to emphasize ""it was his last (fill in the blank)""? Beyond the first and final few chapters, the rest is irrelevant fluff that verges on deification of a pretty standard disillusioned youth searching to find himself. The story is interesting in a way that a car accident on the side of the road is, little more, but Krakauer treats the subject with such reverence that you would think him a latter day saint. Save time and read the Outside magazine article."
4,A Haunting Story,"I read this book in about a day and a half- I simply couldn't put down the haunting story of Chris McCandless. It is rare to find a true story so utterly compelling. I enjoyed how Krakauer not only told the tale of McCandless's journey around the country and into the Alaskan wilderness, but I found it even more interesting when Krakauer added a bit of his own history to the narration.I think that no matter where you came from or who you are, everyone can identify with Chris McCandless in some capacity, which is why this story is so intriguing. I would recommend this book to any and all of my friends."
3,"Good story, bad approach.","Although I really love this story, I think the approach could have been better. The book revealed more information about McCandless and his adventures than the movie by the same title, but the author felt it necessary to include his own personal adventures in the book as well almost advertising his previous book ""Into Thin Air."" The book became redundant towards the end, but over all it was very informative and quenches the thirst for adventure in the outdoor junkie in us all. Four stars for content, but three for approach."
2,It was ok,"Truthfully, there were a lot of big words I did not know the meaning of. I realize since the young man did not live to tell his tale, it is was all done via other people and writings or notes he left. I think the book was a little too disjointed."
3,so-so,"This book was okay. It wasn't my favorite, but it was good. It has stories of other people who did the samething, and I was bored with their stories after the first few pages. Other than that Chris's life story after college was very interesting and there were parts I couldn't put the book down."
4,Good for Book Club with Teens,"I have some very mature, well-read preteen friends who chose this for our book club reading. They're unusual (ages 11 and 12) but I think it's safe to generalize this to older kids. The book offers opportunity for interesting discussions appropriate to the world of adolescents, such as learning from mistakes (or not), forgiveness, weighing whether sticking to ones' principles is worth hurting other people, and the allure of risktaking and danger. I read it when it first came out and found that rereading it with these new eyes made it new and interesting for me."
4,Every parent's fear?,"""Into the Wild"" is a very interesting book about the life of a young man who decided to get rid of his normal, mundane life, move to the wilds of Alaska and live in nature. It follows his story, using interviews awith key friends and acquaintances, of how he travelled around the United States in search of his real truth. In the end, he ends up dying in a remote area in the Alaskan wilderness, all alone and malnourished.Did he die of starvation? Was he sick from berries he ate? What was his mindset during his last days?The book, and the movieInto the Wild, hauntingly tell his story. It's a story that every parent wishes their idealistic 20-something children don't try to live themselves. It's captivating and interesting, however.Krakauer is a great writer, who creates even more drama and suspense here than it may warrant. I also highly recommend hisInto Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition), one of my favorite books of all time."
2,bleh,"I just finished this book and I feel icky. I feel like the author went into writing the book with a closed perspective of things. He describes Chris as idealistic and young. He is asking ""why?"" why was Chris compelled to enter the wilderness, why have others been compelled to? as if its some exotic strange thing, when in fact it is more natural than anything. there is nothing strange about wanting to live how humans are supposed to live and how we have lived for millions of years in comparison with living against nature for only about 10,000 years. although he says that he doesnt want to belittle Chris' experiences and passions by saying he was arrogant, i feel like this is implied anyways."
3,dragged on,"I enjoyed most of the book, my heart goes out to the family, but in some chapters the author would just go on and on about other peoples experiences in the wild and I didn't care to hear about others, just this one. That was the only down side of the book for me."
3,Survival of the Fittest,"Jon Krakauar is a great author and the book is beautifullly written (the reason I gave it a 3 Star rating).However, this book is a typical example of someone who failed to adapt to modern society. I am sure that Chris McCandless was a gifted and charming young man, but someone who had great difficulty accepting today's society (with all its admitted flaws).The only factor that distinguished Chris from all the other dead young people was that he died in the wilderness of Alaska; most other young people with similar perspectives usually end up with drug overdoses.And a few others end up like the unabomber (minus the bombs)And while his death seems pointless, I feel that Chris was too mentally falwed (for some unknown reason) to lead a 'typical successful' life."
3,Into the Wild,Into the Wild is a book about a man who wandered into the wilderness of Alaska. I don't want to give away the ending because they already told it at the beginning of the book. This book tells the story of what happened to the man toward the end of his life. It tells of people he meets and situations he encounters. If you like to read the backs of books first this book is for you.
1,A book about nothing,"From the moment I read from many aspects false Krakauer's report on the Everest accident called Into thin air, I disliked his way of writing, thinking and false self-absorbed reporting. I still decided to give him another go with Into the wild. A mistake. I spent the first 3/4 of the book waiting for Alaskan trip of the boy to begin. And had to endure author's accounts of anything he could even remotely connect to the story (including one of his own solo climbs, oh yes that's how cool he is).Apart from the dislike I have for the author, coming from a part of the world still suffering consequences of a brutal war, I have little understanding for a rich kid with not a single problem in life but a troubled mind that leads him to suicide.What a bad book to sellect for my first Kindle purchase. I wish myself more luck with the next one."
3,A little disappointing.,"I admit that I was a little disappointed in this book. While the story of Chris McCandless is very interesting, I think the author could have done a better job with it. I found it tacky that he put his own story in the midst of the book which was not about him....."
2,Kids do the darndest things.,"Attention would-be ""hermits:"" Alaskan winters are still very cold. Krakauer illustrates quite clearly the consequences of being an idiot in the woods. Nature, romantic notions of it notwithstanding, can and will kill you. Beware. Decent work by Mr. Krakauer, but the story left behind by Mr. McCandless remains at best as a good example of a very bad idea."
3,Story of a selfish young man,"This book is a good read, and I have a lot of sympathy for the author. However, I couldn't help but despise Chris/Alex for his utter selfishness. He appears to be sneering at all people who lead an ""ordinary life"", yet if all of us started ""exploring"" the wild by sitting in a bus and shooting at everything that moves within a couple yards how would the wilderness look?"
3,Well written and interesting but...,"A young, upper class, white guy living this way is an idealistic wanderer. A middle aged, overweight white guy living this way is a creepy drifter.I understand the desire for ""something more"" and even the need to go on a spiritual journey, but the protaganist also embodies the self absorption and narcissism that can taint such things. The truth is that there are other, better, healthier ways to do these things. I, for example, volunteered at Covenant House Alaska for a year. Did I die? Nope. Did I contribute? Yep. Did I have an awesome experience? Sure.Like the writer, don't like the kid."
5,A book to know,"This book should be read to help us all get out and do something with our lives. We are living, so go live. Life only gives us a certain amount of time. And time goes so fast.I'm not suggesting you sell your belongings and become a nomad; (unless that suits you) but be active. Life is too short to sit around and be stale.Read this book. I hope that a piece of Chris McCandless stays with you reminds you to live better!Jon Krakauer has done a fabulous job with hard project writing this book. I am grateful."
2,ok,I was interested in the story of the main charaction. This book was written a bit too much like a first year college term paper.
3,"In the end, I was glad I read it.","I read this book years ago and had a hard time getting through it. But I kept going because I needed to read the details of how it happened. In the end, I was glad I did.Recently, I saw the movie at the video store. I was immediately drawn to it. For a book that didn't read so well, very slow paced, it always seemed to have stuck with me. I debated whether or not I should rent it. In the end, my curiosity won out. I couldn't imagine how they could have fit the book into a two hour movie.In the end, I was glad I watched it. The movie gave the book a whole new meaning. This was a very sad story, yet one that needed to be told. One that will stick with you forever."
3,Chris McChanless a man who made some interesting decisions,"I feel that the book Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer was a pretty good book. I think that McCandless was a man that really liked nature and know one really looks at him in this way. Most people say that he was stupid. I think that he was stupid in some ways as well because he should have been better equiped for his journy in the Alaskan mountains. As much as I like the nature myself I think that McCandless was kind of stupid for all of the things that he turned down like the 25,000 dollars that his dad gave him. All and all I feel that Jon Krakauer wrote a pretty good book that was a little suspenceful at times throughout the book. I find myself to be a young a Alex Supertramp, wanting to see the world and be a real person. I was great to read this book and finally see a real person -- a person that can and will be my remodel."
4,Pretty Interesting Book,"I was very moved by this movie, and the book does highlight some of the things that were missed in the movie. The only thing that really didn't interest me was what the author needed to add his two cents worth, when he was growing up.About Chris, it broke my heart, that he really wanted to get back home and the little mistakes that were made prevented him from doing that. What a heartache for his family.I had a husband ""disappear"" and he died in 1987, so I believe I can relate to a ""what-if"" scenaro."
4,A Thought Provoking Book!,"I enjoyed the book, but the format was a little different than most books. The whole book is written as a reflection on Chris McCandless's life. The plot is relatively similar to many other authors' ""go out into the wild and discover yourself"" type of theme, but Krakauer takes this idea one step farther. I did enjoy the reading, and the flow and style of the book was really good, but the book dragged on. It seems like Krakauer went into to much detail. The vocabulary used seemed appropriate for the age group that this book is geared for. I would recommend this book. -Craig B"
2,Mcandless was very childlike in his actions.,"I did not like John Krakuer's book Into The Wild. I had trouble following Krakuer's feelings on McCandless's journey. I feel that Chris McCandless was an angry, self absorbed individual, who believed that if he journeyed into nowhere he would be able to show his parents who was boss. Instead his selfish act backfired and nature showed McCandless who was boss."
4,Eloquently done,"Krakeur has eloquently written a book on a subject few people seem to understand - the intrinsic need that some young men feel to let go of the clutches today's society has on us and to find their sense of self in nature. Though I was unable to relate to McCandless' feelings, Krakauer's book gave me an understanding and an appreciation of the things through which Chris went. Krakauer's divergence from the actual story - quotations before each chapter, chapters devoted to entirely different stories, etc - broadened the picture and gave a more round approach to the story. All in all, this book was incredibly well done."
2,Moving!,"This book depicts a person who tries to change himself into a new man. In the process he finds a new way of life. When it seems he is coming to his end, he tries to change back to his old ways, only to find his death. Good book and an easy read. **Jason R.**"
4,"It's moving, in a few ways.","Great book. The story surely touched alot of people as there's well over 1000 reviews. I'm sure it saddens some people, inspires others. Like most people I kinda knew the story going in, but this was much deeper of course. The author is a great writer, really good at descriptions. Good vocabulary. There were many moments I felt like I was right there, on a train, in the cold, or on the bus. Some people no doubt think this kid was an unprepared moron, some feel he had the right idea. I think it's best to agree with a bit of each side and find a realistic place in the middle to exist. Sometimes life needs to be simplified, just not this much. Overall his travels were quite an adventure, as is the book. I'd almost call it essential reading for any traveler, or dreamer. Read it, see the movie, and get the Eddie Vedder soundtrack. All three are good stuff."
4,Krakauer does it again.,"Krakauer claims he is a journalist. Don't let him fool you. He may be a journalist, but he writes with the touch of a great novelist. Taking a difficult topic (tragic death of a young man) he presents all sides of the story, from the young mans perspective to that of his parents. Krakauer allows his own experience to blend (not overpower) with his story and draws great insight from the two. Highly recommended for adults who dont understand their kids, and for kids who just cannot fathom their parents. This book may well save a life or two."
5,Unputdownable!,"Tough reading - heartbreaking. As a mother of two young children I just hope nothing that devastating would ever happen to me - my children. But I still find myself on the side of the young adventurer - who has no obligation to live his life for his parents, who has only the obligation to pursue his own dreams, even if making foolish mistakes. Naive? Maybe. Young and courageous? Certainly."
2,I never really got it.,"I very much enjoyed Into Thin Air and I recommend Krakauer, but I never really got an understanding of what he was getting at. I think it was a very personal thing. He saw something of himself in this kid. The best part was Krakauer's own recollections of going to Alaska to climb a pinacle alone. I felt that part redeemed the whole book."
5,Best book ever!!!!!!!!,"I'm 12 years old, and this book was completly understandable. I loved every bit of it and would read it 25 times! I would reckomend this book to anyone between the ages of 11-1111. It is a tale of a young heart strugling to find his place in the world. He findes it, but in the wilderness. This is the best book ever! READ IT!"
3,worth more from historical and author perspective,"not quite a ""cant put it down"" book-does however have merit from a boigraphicaL and historical perspective.i enjoyed the authors own storied experiences as well as other historical adventures/ tales.the author should not have compared himself to the primary-he would not have failed nor should this story have made headlines as it has-misfortune and misadventure are daily occurances in a land as vast and extreme as alaska."
2,Jumps Around Too Much!,"This book has too many flashbacks and flash forwards. I was expecting the gritty, hour by hour terror of the author's Into Thin Air. I was sorely disappointed. I suggest you read Into Thin Air, instead."
3,"McCandless was a selfish, mentally-ill fool.","Krakauer did a good job cobbling a book together from the scant scraps of information available. However, his characterization of McCandless as a young idealist became ever more grating the more I read. He was one of the most selfish people of which I have heard; disapearing from his parents' and family's lives one day without trace while communicating regularily via letter and postcards with strangers he'd met along his journeys. How could he stroll to his doom with a backpack full of Tolstoy and rice with nary the faintest prick of conscience as to how his parents felt in the two years since he'd spoken to him to them, before he'd begun his 'journey'. McCandless was a man generous and friendly to strangers, indifferent and callous to his parents. He was a fool possessed of neither the basest of common sense nor conscience. He was nobody's hero."
2,Mediocre adventure book,"I myself have often thought about escaping society in much the same way that McCandless did, so I read this book hoping to understand what he learned and felt. You don't get his personal feelings and thoughts though, but instead just an adventure story of what he did. In part, this is due to his sparse journals which don't reveal his thoughts and feelings. Krauker tells the story in a confusing non-linear plot which left me trying to piece together the parts into a coherent journey. Mixing in the tales of others that have gone on isolated journeys did not help much. Overall, the book is confusing and does not help to reveal the deep spiritual meanings McCandless was searching for."
3,if you like outdoors................,Into the wild is kind of a slow book. It's starts off and tells how the main character dies in the first ten pages. The book is kind of back and fourth. It takes you through all different parts of the story at anytime and it can be very confusing at some points. The story is also very interesting at some points. The story can be very surprising because the main character always does the opposite of what a normal person would do. He is always getting into many different predicaments. If you like slow jump around kind of books then you love this story by Jon Krakauer.
3,Not quite what I expected,"Not a bad book, however, I didn't understand why the author went on a tangent about his own climbing ordeals in the past. I'm sure it was to relate to the subject's story in some similar point. Hard to understand why intelligent people have the need to put themselves through life altering situations like this. I wonder if they're so bored with life that they need another way to challenge themselves. Seems like some people are too smart for their own good.I can relate to the young man's strugles with his parents though. Seems like no matter what he did, it just wasn't good enough."
3,Worth reading but not the best,"I agree with other reviewers who have said that Krakauer didn't have enough content to write an entire book on McCandless. A lot of information is repeated, and 2 chapters are about the author himself. I was annoyed reading those chapters, and if not for my obsessiveness about completing books I would have skipped them altogether. All things considered it was an enjoyable and quick read."
3,A frustated Adventure,"""Men a Woman are free, but they have be responsible for their own actions and they have to accept the consequences that these actions can bring"". Christopher Johnson McCandless walked into the deep in Alaska, trying to archive his goal, to make a dream come true. He left everything, his car, his family, his own future, only because he wanted to know how far he could go. And he did it, he died knowing how far he went, and also trying to go back the time, because he realized that all the thing that he left, were more important that his own stupid dream. In my opinion, Chris was a good kid, I admire him, because he had a strong temperament, and I like that kinds of people, but sometimes we have to control our self because we can do stupid things, as Chris did. I recommend this book, for those people who like adventure stories and true stories. I make me think how far a kid can go only for archive his goal, and the consequences that you can have."
2,Adventure With Too Much Filler,"Although I enjoyed the storyline itself (about Chris McCandless' life leading up to and going into the wild), Krakauer added too much ""filler"" using his own life-experiences and boring quotes from others. He seems to have done his homework for the most part, but the book would have only been around 100 pages without the added garbage. Also, Krakauer uses words that are above the average reader's comprehension, thus making for more difficult reading. I plan on giving Karkauer a second chance by reading a book about his own real-life adventures and seeing if my opinion changes any."
3,Well written book about a kid with a deathwish.,"I have read nearly all of Jon Krakauer's books and have enjoyed them all. He is a superb writer, however, I sensed that he admired Chris. Sorry, that escapes me. This book was aggravating to me from the ""get-go"". Chris was a spoiled, lazy, thoughtless,selfish and user brat! I had absolutely zero sympathy for the situation he put himself in. He died because he wanted to."
2,What exactly was the point of this book?,"Jon Krakauer's organization in his book Into the Wild was jumpy and confusing. It doesn't seem as if the author ever settles on a style of organizing his writing, and just writes what comes to mind about whichever interview is on top. Then the author suddenly begins to write about other people who have died in the wild before even finishing the first story! The author's interjection of his own experiences show the reader how to relate to what Chris was feeling, yet as before, the his story isn't even finished at this point in the book.. This reader feels that it is confusing to hear opinions and reasons for the actions of Chris McCainles before we even knows what all happened to the boy."
3,good book with a fabricated ending,"This is a well-written book that holds one's attention on most pages. However, it is a a classic case of yellow journalism - the description and explanation of Chris's death are totally fabricated by the author. There is not the slightest evidence that Chris was poisoned by any plant, period. I am an expert in this field and can tell you with certainty that the evidence tells us that the death described by Krakauer is simply impossible and wholly false. He should be ashamed for making this garbage up about someone's death."
4,"WHY Go Into the Wild? See the Movie, but Read the Book First","Because... ""The accumulated clutter of day-to-day existence--the lapses of conscience, the unpaid bills, the bungled opportunities, the dust under the couch, the inescapable prison of your genes--all of it is temporarily forgotten, crowded from your thoughts by an overpowering clarity of purpose and the by the seriousness of the task at hand.""At such moments something resembling happiness actually stirs in your chest...""The movie is one of the best adaptations of a book I've seen in a long time. I appreciate that the screenwriter didn't add a stupid non-existant love interest.Krakauer inveigles his readers to perambulate the trails and thoughts of doomed Chris McCandless, a sort of eremitic. He also challenges his readers to take on words like analysand, contumacious, desideratum, lumpen, opprobrium, and sobriquet.INTO THE WILD is a seriously satisfying hike.Note: Check out the interior book design by Deborah Kerner. Great work."
1,I didnt expect a documentary style read,"My fault, just wasnt what I was looking for. Too depressing to chronicle the death of a young person with such potential."
3,Reminds me of myself,It was a pretty good book but the formatting was a bit confusing it was a documrntiry and a story in one but I would recommend if you able to understand it.Then again I am only 13 so I could just be me
4,A thought-provoking look: the wanderer inside unleashed.,"I first was amazed, then disappointed, then puzzled by the matter in this book. From the outset, I was saying, ""I would NEVER do that! He must have been crazy; just ridiculous..."" But, then I realized I was having trouble putting it down. If I did not have the things around me which I love so much, and did have some of the same inner drive and courage, I would probably try something similar. Krakauer's in-depth treatment of what appears to be something else shows us all some of the inner wanderer we sacrifice when we settle down into our ho-hum ""so-called"" lives."
4,Krakauer's Hard Lesson,"Krakauer again chronicles an event that involves man challenging the forces of nature. Once again, nature has won. In my opinion, the intentions of Chris McCandless were of secondary importance. The real substance of the book is the implication of the predominance of nature. A fine read and an exciting commentary on an insignificant young soul, whose failure provides a significant reminder that the vital forces in this universe are still reserved to nature."
2,Get to the Point,"I though the content of this book was very thorough. It included all of the information the reader would want to know. This book included stories about Chris's journey across the country, people he came into contact with and his opinion on everything. Into the Wild told about his good times, bad times and what eventually lead to his death. I did not like the style of this story at all. Krakauer went back and forth from the time Chris died, to all his traveling adventures. This made the book very confusing to read. Also the long parts about others' adventures into the wild were totally irrelevant in my opinion. I did like the journal entries and chunks of stories at the begining of the chapters. They gave insights and almost foreshadowed what was yet to come. EN"
3,this book was unorganized.,I liked the book becuase it was like a Quintin Tarantino move. I liked how when they talked about one of the peopel who picked up or meet Chris they tould us how the knew Chris and how they felt towards him. With each chareter they tell us were they mett and what they knew about Chris. I also like that they gave examples of other people like chris in the story.
3,This book is not a page turner,"This book Into the Wild was about a man who went into the Wild to died. At a point you would think he was nuts but in some sense he was doing something his class wouldn't have done died in the wild. It talk about a young man character and the way he wanted to die. I read it over the summer for school, when I first look at the cover I thought it would be intersting but in the end it wasn't a page turned it was very boring,despresing and dumb. I would not recommonded it for it for people who are younger or people who cry easily you will not like it. Don't read it in a weekend you will have a boring weekend. People may like this if they don't know no better but I really hated it but it did have meaning in it.If you like the wild don't read it you will it very bord. I think it is not the best book in the world."
4,Good Book,"Book is good, the movie is even better. The book does not have personality like the movie does. You did not feel for the main character, unlike the movie that made me cry in the end. Although the book is interesting, there are additional outdoorsmen stories."
5,Into the Wild - incredibly awesome!!,"Excellent book, one of the best I have read in a long time. Krakauer's vivid descriptions allow one to feel as though (s)he is walking right along in the wilderness with Chris McCandless. The dialogue between Chris and the folks he meets helps one obtain a better insight into his frame of mind, almost like reading his diary. I found it sad yet understandable how a young man could embark on such a life-altering jouney that would unfortunately end in tragedy. Highly recommended read!!!"
4,Interesting,"The book was interesting because it explored the character of McCandless where the movie did not. I found it moving, enlightening, but of all it made me appreciate my friends and family.""Happiness only real when shared.""My only complaint with the book is when the author, Krakauer began retelling his own experiences rock climbing in the wild. It wasn't a huge deal to me, but in my opinion it slightly impaired the flow of the book. But, nonetheless, I enjoyed this book and recommend it...give it a try!"
3,A good read,I found this book some what disturbing. There seems to be little relationship between IQ and judgment. When I was a seven year old kid a friend and I made a parachute out of a bed sheet and I jumped off our garage. I survived but almost broke both legs and that single event taught me to think things through a little better. The book was ok but was not much more that the story of a young man lacking in judgment.
4,An extreme young man learns lessons too late.,"Krakauer attempts to remain objective in his portrayal of young McCandless. The author identifies with him but remains fair in his opinions. This book does for McCandless what he himself could not do when he was alive: challenges people to change their lives. However it also shows the lessons the young man learn too late: experience is just as important as intelligence and also that people need each other. McCandless, though a little arrogant and extreme, could have contributed a lot to society with the lessons he learned had he lived. Perhaps this book does it for him."
5,Krakauer is a wonderful writer,"Krakauer is a wonderful writer - His style is similar to Tino Georgiou. I've just blown through this book as well as The Fates (Tino's novel), and for me - their writing is the kind of stuff that makes for late nights and tired workdays. I can't pay him a higher compliment. This one was a bit different than his other efforts in that Krakuer plays more the role of detective/sociologist rather than an an insightful expedition biographer. However, the story was as rivetting and perhaps even more powerful. I'm anxiously awaiting his next one! Also, if you're one of the few who missed Tino's masterpiece, go and get yourself a copy."
3,Bitter sweet,Into the wild is a book bordering on genius and insanity much like the people written so passionately in it's pages. The book is a great read for sure but whether or not it is a good thing is hard to say. I feel cheated. After seeing the preview for the movie I hoped for an inspirational book but after reading the cover I realized that wasn't going to be the case. It is written like an article and not a story. That made it feel more real and at the same time ruined the beautiful story with reality. Hopefully this book will deter people from tempting the fates to escape what they'll miss the most in the end.
5,Solitude!,Amazing book! Kraukauer has done an excellent job relating Chris's thoughts and struggles to the reader. A great adventure book!RyanG
2,Weird!!,"I have read many reviews now and i am not happy that not one has mentioned his journeys before he got to Alaska! Krauker does a horrible job on telling the story and makes it really boring to the reader. McCandless was an idealistic young man. Don't get stuff tangled and twisted, he was not bright , he left unprepared to go into the wild"
2,Used,"It's a really great book, had to read this for my summer reading, their were two issues though:1) it took over 2 weeks to arrive at my house, and that time really made it difficult to finish on time for school2) be careful when ordering to make sure you order a new copy because the used ones are VERY used, as in you can still read them but my cover was all bent and curving upwards"
3,Good Price for school,"I needed to buy this book for a college course and I knew our book store was over priced, After searching the Web, Amazon was the cheapest I found. Not the greatest book though, but then again I don't like to read..."
2,Very Dull,"I am in the middle of this book and I will probably finish it, but I am skipping large sections and it doesn't seem to matter. The book is boring and pointless. I don't care about Chris. If he was worthy of a book about his life, then Krakauer missed the mark."
3,Alaskan Odyssey,"Hi my name is Ariana O'Connor and I will like to send in a book review to you on the book Into the Wild by: Jon Krakauer. Book Review: This book is recommended to readers especially at the teenage and adult level, anyone who is trying to discover their identity, and are make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. This book is a fictional biography of a young man wanting to discover his true self by facing the concentrated, vastness of the Antarctic tundra, the wild. This book is one of its kind of enlightening what seems to be just another pointless death of someone trying to take on the wild, through parallels of historical examples, the author's own experience on this topic, and real quotes from those who befriended this high spirited vagabond. Into the Wild, a book with too many facts fed at once but get the satisfaction of being captivated by capturing the spirit of truth, innocence, and adventure of the truly naive, and pure of heart. Must read!"
4,A Compeling Story.,"As an avid hiker, outdoor lover, and general interest in adventure, I found this story to be somewhat amazing. Krakauer does an excellent job of giving the reader descriptions that let the mind wonder what it would like in this young man's shoes. I only wish he had gone into more detail about the young man himself. That mystery, however, is part of what makes this story so enjoyable."
3,It could have been worse!,"The book INTO THE WILD was a book that I was forced to read for school, so I guess that my opinion on of this book also relates to the fact that I didn't want to read it. Anyway I will try and be as unbiased as possible. This book had some neat parts, I can't remember quite where they were, but I know that there had to be some? But atleast I got to read the babbalings of Mr. Krakauer and how he thought Mr. Supertramp (Chris) effected him profoundly. Well, I guess I can't blame the author, after all It was a true story, but I would like to. If you like a book about stupided people who go into the frozen land of Alaska, with alot of rice and a plan to find themselves out there, you will love this book, but if not read ENDRE'S GAME!"
3,Not a bad read...,"This book wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Krakauer did a great job researching and digging up facts about the main character, but I thought there was a level of bias and opinion that did not need to be interjected into the book. The story itself is fascinating enough to make it worth the read. Is it worth buying? I think you'd be better off going to the library."
3,I am attracted to this type of book,"I like these sort of ""Adventure"" books as a change from the ""Oprah Book Club"" type novels. I enjoyed reading about Chris McCandless and his adventures. I found him to be a selfish child, yet I understood his philosophies. He acted stupidly, yet I think that because he died, he left a strong message for all of us to hear. His life served a purpose, a very important one. And maybe if he had lived, his message would have never been heard.I wasn't so hot on the way Jon Krakauer added his own expeditions into the story line, I felt it was unnecessary. He also didn't need to use other adventurer's examples. Chris McCandless's adventure was story enough by itself. I ended up skipping over those chapter's paralleling Chris's story.I sympathsize for Chris's parents and sister, but feel they understand there son/brother better than anyone."
5,"compelling, haunting, and wonderful","This book was most definitely one of my favorite reads, once you pick it up it is hard to put back down. Makes you want to throw away the bonds of society and live in a romantic world of man and nature. I am somewhat disheartened by the apparent misreading of the book by some people, I think McCandless' story is misunderstood by people who can't comprehend leaving our materialistic-industrial society for nothing but peace of mind. Three cheers for Krakauer who made us aware of this amazing story, also the author of the incredible ""Into Thin Air,"" a story of the tradgedy of a climb up Mount Everest in 1996."
3,"Fascinating to read, but...","This is one of those books that I found myself riveted to but strangly annoyed by at the same time. I found the author's surmised descriptions of Alex's travels well done and compelling. However, I sensed that the author wrote with an admiration for Alex that I lacked. Then I was finished with the book I thought of what a sad, wasted life it was and of how it must have affected the people round him. This was not a life to be admired, but morned as a waste of a clearly gift youth."
3,Suicide by Alaska,"There is not question Krakauer can write well.But why he chose to memorialize someone so inept, is beyond me. It is not admirable to venture into Alaska so woefully under prepared one starves to death one days walk from help.The main character is delusional, ill prepared, under read and immature.When someone does what this guy did we call it ""suicide by Alaska."""
5,Into the Wild,I'll make this brief. I read this book a couple of years agoand it had a great impact on me. It's definitely one to be shared. Igot online because I am sending this book to a friend of mine....Five Words: Buy it; buy it now.
