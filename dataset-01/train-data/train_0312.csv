5,A true classic,"Silverstein does not disappoint! Poem after poem, he takes simple, kid-friendly wonders and fears and creates clear imagery using rhyme, rhythm and cadence. The reader with begin and end the piece with a smile."
5,perfect,"I bought two for friends children. I love these books and they came with extra poems! Came on time,and in perfect condition!I recommend these books to anyone with children. They are wonderful!"
4,My first book of poetry,"This is my first book of poetry. I like most of the poems because some are funny and some are lovely. I like the illustrations, very nice drawings. I even tried to draw them and they came out very good. The book is very easy to read because most of the poems are short. I also love it because there is a CD that you could hear it while you read the book. Finally I recommend this book because the author is very creative, it is a very nice book!- Keyli F. Gomez"
5,If only all poetry was this enjoyable,"Growing up and attending school, I had to read poetry every single year. Whether it was Anton Chekhov and Milton in college, Shakespeare in elementary school, or Dante and Homer in high school, I found it all boring and sometimes hard to fathom. Instead, the only poetry I found enjoyable were those by Shel Silverstein in this book and his other classic, A Light in the Attic. Before there was Harry Potter, there was Shel Silverstein's poetry. Fun, enjoyable, easy to read, with minimal need of understanding; these are probably the most famous poetry put out by an American author. Readable by all 1st graders, they are enjoyable for adults and perfect teaching aides. I highly recommend it."
4,Nostalgia,I used to read this book of poems all the time when I was in elementary school. I bought it to read to my kids. I hope they love it as much as I always did.
3,Awesome book ok condition,"The book is the best! The condition was ok, but well worth it. I bought for my nine yr old so it will see some definite wear when she's done."
3,Where the Sidewalk Ends,"This book is full of humorous poems and doesn't make you bored. The poems are mostly unpredictable as to how they will end. Everybody can get a laugh out of this book, and it is very easy to read. However there is a mystery of why the author wrote these poems. There are a lot of questions that make readers think. He has a unique taste which other authors do not have. People who haven't had a good laugh recently would like this book."
3,New but copy smells,"The service was prompt but came from an individual, not a company. Although the copy is new, it has a distinct odor - like it has perhaps been stored in a room of cigarette smoke or near other smoky items. Turning the pages of the book with my son is not terribly pleasant, and I feel like I have to hold the book away from his face."
5,One of my favorites,"I used to have this book as a kid and it was one of my favorites. I don't know where my original copy went, but I wanted to share it with my daughter. The book is excellent just as expected and also has some extra poems and drawings! We love reading it at bedtime!"
5,Another great book!,Where the sidewalk ends is also a great book. I will be giving it to my niece for Christmas. She loved A Light in the Attic so I'm sure she'll love this one too.
5,Child hood favorite,BOook was in greeat condition.. bought for the kids to love it as much as I did when I was a kid. And yepp they do...
5,A Wonderful Book,"My daughter read this book when she was in grade school. I can't even begin to tell you how often she read it. When I found it on Amazon.com, I bought it for my grandsons, her sons, so they can enjoy it now. Wonderful Book"
5,My fav book growing up!,I have wanted this book for a long time and finally bought it. I checked it out so many times in grade school and now my seven year old is reading it!
3,This is okay,"Not wild about this book for my grandchildren, but they enjoyed. Had mixed reviews from them.Would not purchase this again"
5,Must Read,Everyone needs to read this book. I mean it's Shel Silverstein that's enough reason. I'm a current college student and I purchased this book to re-read some of my favorite poems from when I was younger.
5,You remember the voices of those who read to you,"On the floor, sneakers untied, wearing a cow lick in my hair that doesn't dare go down, I sat and listened to this book be read a good portion of my grade school life. With each poem, the reader would add their own interpretation to what the voice should sound like when resighting these great verses. I can still hear my fourth grade teacher hollerin ""SISTER FOR SALE!!! SISTER FOR SALE!!"" or my dad's muffling of a man voice as the last line is interrupted by the boa constrictor. Now as a parent I have a new level of enjoyment as I give these memories to my two daughters as they look up gleaming imagining beyond the lines and into the voices of these poems. Buying this book is a great investment for wonder memories, for the young and old. I never thought I could enjoy a children's book this much as an adult until I reintroduced myself with Where the side walk ends and started reading them to my own children"
5,love this book!,"I remember fondly our elementary school librarian reading to us from this book for years, and can't wait to give it to my son! I'm sure it will give us many happy memories. It arrived quickly and in new condition, I'm so happy with this purchase."
4,"Wonderful Book, Awesome Seller!","I ordered this book for my 9 year old son and he loves it as much as I did. Purchasing this was fast and easy, it arrived quickly and in good condition. Thanks!!"
5,Another great book by Silverstein!,"Again, another outstanding book by Shel Silverstein! We love reading this, and it gives us lots to talk about, and helps our son work on his conversation skills, comprehension and language. We love this book!"
4,silly silly,your kids and adults too will like the poetry of shil silverstien some of it is so silly thats what makes it funny and something to think about
4,Great for bedtime and beyond,"Mine don't get the poems just yet(4), but they love the silliness of it. and they will have it well into their school years too :+)"
5,It's the cutest book I know. That's just it - SOOOOO cute!!!,"This book includes some of the greatest poems of Shel Silverstein,which are full of humor and naivety, and appeal for both childrenand adults. I trust that whoever reads this book will surely agree."
4,Amazing,"I love this book, when I was a child I used to read this book all the time, not including the two others. Recently my child had said something about reading it at school and how she loved it so much. I decided to purchase them for her, it brought back great memories. This is very appropriate, smart, whitty, and really for all ages!!"
5,A Great Book To Remember!,"I read this book back in 1980 when I was 11 yrs old. I have never forgotten the way it made me laugh and always cheered me up. My personal favorite as a child was ""Sick"". ""I am too sick to go to school today..."" I read that one and several others over and over again.I was an abused child and the book brought something into my daily existence that I sorely needed. Laughter! I would highly recommend this book to anyone (as matter of fact I recommended it to the reading group at www.familyeducation.com). Not only will children find the poems and drawings to be of great amusement, but adults will remember the things in their childhood that brought a smile to their face as well!I plan on buying this book for my children as well as the other Silverstein books. They are all excellent!"
5,Shel is magic,"I never read this book when I was a kid, but as an adult, I felt the magic and shared it with MY children. I probably ran across his poems when I was young, but never knew who wrote them. That's a shame because I missed stepping into Shel's world completely until I was in my 20s.My kids love these poems, and have since they were old enough to giggle. I take them to read-aloud in my children's classrooms now, and make darn sure new generations not only know who Shel was, but know that he's the magician behind the poetry.If you haven't read this book, or any of Shel Silverstein's others, you are missing out on an important part of life--to laugh and connect with the rest of the world through childhood and laughter and the silliness of life.I'd give it ten stars if I could."
5,Where the sidewalk Ends,"This book written by Shel Silverstein is a wonderful written collection of poems. His stories and pictures are very funny and profound. He displays how being a kid can be fun, troublesome, and hard. He has a story about everything a young kid goes through and enjoys in life. I like this book because it compares to the life i lead when i was little. I would recomend this book and the other collections that he has wrote to anyone who like to laugh."
5,Best Children's Book of Poems,"Shel Silverstein has made one of the best book of poems I have ever read. The poems are light and cute and some have morals to them. Take the poem ""Sara Cynthia Sylvia Stout Would Not Take The Garbage Out"". This proves to kids that if you don't take the garbage out, it will just keep piling and piling up all the way to the ceiling. My favorite poem is ""The Dirtiest Man In The World"". I think it is so funny, but in a sick sort of way. There are lots of other poems that are funny, and I would recommend this book to any parent. I know their kids would enjoy them and will keep re-reading the book until they have the poems memorized. Some are short, some are long. The illustrations are cute just as the poems are."
5,Jose Another Fan Of Shel,"I think Shel Silverstein wrote some good books.One of them is where the sidewalk ends.I also like all of his other books.If I was shel I would feel proud of my self .I recommend his books to my family, and friends."
5,One of my favorites,"I can remember this being one of the first books I was able to read by myself as a child. Now, my youngest is learning to read and this is by far our favorite book to read together. Shel Silverstein was a true artist and is greatly missed!"
5,Just Perfect,This compilation of his poems is so awesome. It's entertaining for our daughter and for us while we read them to her. It's a classic we'll keep for always.
4,Book Report- Where The Sidewalk Ends,This is a great book about poems by Shel Silverstein. My favorite poem in this book is called hungry mungry. It is about a man who keeps on eating and eating until he eats people and then the U.S. army! He keeps on eating until hes eaten earth. Then he eats the galaxy! Half of the poems made me laugh. It is very odd and strange but a really good book. -Zack
5,Someone to look for....,"A friend of mine sings a song on this CD. His name is J Cabrera and he sings ""California"". EXCELLENT SONG! His style is a mixture between Matchbox 20 and Dave Matthews Band with a bit of Tex Mex thrown in. Check him out at www.jcabrera.netThis cd is incredible. The music is great. The movie makes you think. The music has some traditional mexican music remade into modern way."
5,Insight into the Chinese Consumer,Great book if you would like to obtain an indepth view of the Chinese Consumer. A MUST read!!
5,It's hard to underestimate the effect this album had on my life.,"I think this was the first Christian rock album I received, a long, long time ago. I've listened to it hundreds of times, and my first copy is pretty worn out. But every time I listen to it, as I am right now, I remember how enchanted I was when I first heard it, and I relive it. What a great album, probably my one of my absolute favorites. My favorite song is ""Shine"" but only by a narrow margin. These songs are all joyful and worshipful, and in my opinion this is the best Christian rock album made to date."
4,the best of the newsboys,"This is a very thorough (17 songs!) collection of their best work. I did dock it a star for not including the hits ""Breathe"" and ""Love, Liberty, Disco"", I really felt like those should have been included (could have done without the ""Mega-Mix""). Anyways, I really like all of the songs on here, even the new ones. This is a great way to hear their best songs without purchasing all of their cds. I recommend it."
5,Newsboys have never sounded better,"when i heard that the newsboys were coming out with a greatest hits album i figured it would be a pretty good way to get all their best songs on one album without having to switch cd's all the time to hear the song i want. little did i know that not only did i get their best songs on one album, it also contained 4 new songs that are downright awesome, plus the megamix at the end of the album reminds me of the grand finale at a 4th of july fireworks celebration, it contains something for everyone. if you are a newsboys fan this is a must have if for nothing else then the 4 new songs and for the opportunity to hear all your favorite songs without switching cd's. if you have never heard the newsboys before buy this album and find out why this is one of the best bands producing music today."
2,"Yes, this is a ""fun"" album - but...","This is a ""fun"" album - but the lyrics of Shine insult SO MANY people groups.I can't believe that a group that claims to proclaim the love of Christ would choose to record a song that insults and degrades so many.I also cannot believe that CCM plays this song."
5,One of the best Greatest Hits CDs I've ever seen,"Many of these songs are my faves, so it's pretty much a collection of my favorite songs. The Mega-mix is an awesome addition!"
3,OK,"This is an ok book on the subject, but scattered and somewhat self-indulgent. On the other hand, the author is a serious participant in this difficult world, so his opinion is worth weighing. There is so little on the subject that the references are also useful."
2,An expensive wok,"I give it only two stars for two reasons: 1. It is sold as I find out later in Chinese grocery supermarkets for only $9.99 (without the ring); 2. The seasoning instructions are not clear and detailed enough. So I don't know whether it is because I did not do it right or the wok itself, the food stiil sticks on the wok after seasoning, hence defeating the whole purpose of purchasing this wok"
3,Wok,"It is my firs wok and I'm not very happy with it. It took forever to scrub it although I have tried various methods and the shape is not what I have expected - the wok is very shallow. Also, I don't think this is iron - it's very, very light. I own 2 iron pans and they are super heavy. However, I think that it cooks ok, but then I am not experienced with chinese food, so who knows. Having a choice I would not buy it again."
2,Breaks in under a year,"Worked fine for me for first 9 months, then broke down. Had similar experience with Nokia headset - not built to last."
5,Replacement straps for old lamp,"The price was good and delivery excellent. The reason for buying this item is my old straps are looking like failure could be imminent.Always be prepared. PS: This is a simple design that kicks the behind. A creative guy can build his own mounting system for a number of things with these straps. For me, it was an elevated head lamp for use with a Works Enduro Rider steering dampener."
5,King of the South,"T.I. has did it again. This album delivers the mix of street bangers and club hits. This album will continue T.I. to keep his title ""King Of The South"". This marks the next phase in the evolution of him as an artist. This album has been certified Platinum."
2,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...What you know? That there is nothing very original or memorable...period.
5,King of the South,"I am so happy that T.I. is finally getting his recognition (even though it still isn't enough). I have been a fan since his first album - I'm Serious. This album delivers. My favorites are: What You Know, Why You Wanna, Live in the Sky (Jaime Foxx), Hello, Ride Wit Me & Told You So. Most of the album is good. I am a female and I don't really buy rap albums, but I do support T.I...He is also very cute too! Go get the album and support him. You won't be disappointed."
4,King,"The album is fire another hot release from the south. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I don't like the Swiss Beats joint. This is just another example on how the south is holding it down. Within the last year Bun B, Young Jeezy, and now T.I. and I could go on calling out southern rap artist. But any one reading this from the south you already know what it is."
4,T.I. King,This Is a Great Album From T.I. The Flow Is Sick This Album Is Not As Good As His New Cd Paper Trail But It's a Great Rap Album With Great SongsLike Front Back And The Lead Off Single What You Know But Anyway This Is a Good Album Also Go Pick Up Paper Trail I Think It's His Best Album But That's All I Got To Say About This Great Album Thanks For Reading My Reveiw.
3,Listen,"Is this cd copy protected or sumthin cuz i can't import to itunes. and if so, can i do anything about it to get it on my pc besides downloading?"
1,"This is not T.I.P.'s Best Work (I'm Serious, & Trap Muzik)","So far this album that I ran and got proves my theory that any Hip-Hop artist starts from good to okay. T.I. is one of my favorite ATL rappers so far, and the reason I'm throwing in this Review is because I've notice that since he started his album ratings keep droping one at a time, going from 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, and eventually this might drop because of my rating.This album deserves 3.5 because of he's lyrics dropping no type of energy."
2,Minimal on trails.,I wanted more on trails! Other barns are irrelevant unless I am living there. Info on what trails are like and maps was what I expected and didn't get.
3,"Brilliant book, problematic translation","Nicolas Chamfort's insightful aphorisms cut through the pretensions of men and help us see their genuine strengths and weaknesses. Chamfort was greatly admired by Nietzsche, and it is easy to see why. It is really unfortunate that this is the only translation available for Chamfort's Reflections. The translation is incomplete, including only a subset of the aphorisms, and in many places it is strikingly inaccurate. Even in cases where a more literal translation would have both sounded better and more accurately conveyed the original meaning, Parmée elects to make an inaccurate and awkward one. To make matters worse, the translation adopts its own idiosyncratic numbering scheme for the aphorisms, and no cross reference is provided to any edition of the original French, making it very difficult to locate the original for aphorisms the reader finds important.If you can find it, I would recommend instead the translation by E. P. Mathers, published in 1926."
4,Great Sportbike Magazine,"Great Britain publishes the world's best English language bike magazines, and Performance Bikes is my favorite. Always plenty of full color pictures of bikes. They don't skimp like American mags, trying to sell a year's subscription for 12 bucks. The only negative is how high the price has become. $150 a year! Too high. Ten years ago I was paying $55 a year. But they have great comparos on bikes, helmets, security gear, etc. Plus articles you just won't see in American magazines. Tagging along with a gang of guys who bait bike thieves by parking a bike in a high visibility area and then beating the crap out of thieves who try to steal it. Don't look for Harleys and choppers in this mag. Sportbikes and nothing but sportbikes."
3,irritated my skin,"Duro-Med Soft Foam Cervical Collar 2-1/2 Width, White, LargeMy neck was irritated by this collar. I solved my problem by cutting off a piece of the toe of a white cotton sock, and sliding it over the collar. It also helped to rub some A&D; ointment on my neck between the collar and my skin. It also was very uncomfortable sleeping with the collar on, OK to use when on the computer or reading a book."
2,lots of velcro!,"I ordered the small based on the recommended neck measurements. What the description doesn't tell you is that there is a velcro strip approx 4-5 inches long that will scratch your neck if it isn't covered by the other side of the collar, so order with that in mind! Otherwise it's fine, your basic cervical collar..."
1,Unable to use,"My wife and I have been purchasing various items from Amazon for years, and we have never been disappointed until now. The issue is not about the cost of the item, it is about the seller NOT specifying that the item could not be returned. The collar does not fit me. Therefore I cannot use it. I would suggest that all Amazon customers make purchases of items offered by Amazon ONLY!! That is what our family is going to do from now on."
5,"Excitement, love, adventure, a joy to read.....great","Do yourself a favor and read this novel before the movie comes out,,,,it surely will be made into a movie because of the terrific adventure..do yourself a favor and read it ....."
1,Terrible,This thing doesn't work at all.It is the worst product I have ever wasted money on.Do not waste >YOUR< money.
2,How to Do Everything in Bad Taste.,"I have rarely seen a book that purports to teach graphic design, in one way or another, so poorly illustrated. Various manipulations manage to transform bad photographs, both color and back and white, into embarrassingly grotesque examples.Although Macintosh is mentioned occasionally, virtually all of the book concerns itself with PCs. As a Macintosh user, I'm accustomed to this sort of treatment, unfortunately.The title page to Chapter 12 is missing and bears a query from the author, presumably to the publisher: ""Cover Image here. Need from Creative Services.""This book needs a lot more from Creative Services than one image."
1,One star because they didn't have a zero star,I hope that I can save someone else the money by advising them to stay away from this. PS Elements is a very nice home photo package with a lot of features. This book will teach you NONE of the features that your five year old couldn't figure out just playing with the mouse. It has nothing in it that an absolute beginner couldn't figure out for themselves in 20 minutes. Stay away from this book. Worst 26.00 dollars (with shipping) that I have ever spent and I have pulled some lulus. Everyone who bought it should get there money back plus an apology.
1,Not very good.,"The book is Ok. But not as good as others. I would recommend ""Photoshop Elements Solutions"" by Mikkel Aaland if you are serious. It is a bit more pricy because of the included CD with a trial version of Elements and some sample photos for instructional purposes."
1,Learning Digital Imaging,"This book misses a lot of details and ""How to""..Many examples are difficult to complete and results are not easy to achieve..And does not answer the questions.Not good for beginners in Photoshop Elements."
2,"Alot of fluff, no meat.","I cannot recommend this book. The examples (and CD-ROM) are totally useless, and the book goes in no apparent order. The largest chapter is on third-party Xtras, which have nothing to do with learning Director. Anyone trying to learn Lingo will be totally confused by the Indexes and References, and should probably get a Lingo Refernece Manual instead."
2,kata t-214 torso pack,I gave it 2 stars because it is quality made. It is useless to me for my canon 50d with battery pack and extra 70-300 lens and the 28-130 mounted...It is way too small and even barely of use for my nikon 90d. It is totally uncomfortable on the shoulder. I had really expected more from Isreali made products for better R and D....I guess I now am stuck with a 100$ lunch pack which really sucks more as I researched this bag and others and this won. The others would have really sucked. It may work for smaller consumer cams but not mine...Only worse gamble would have been to put it in a slot machine....I lost big on this hand
3,A little slow for preschoolers,I used this with storytimes and the story was too involved for the preschoolers in a group setting. May work better one-on-one or for older children
3,Not for the experienced players,"How useful you find this book, depends on how good you already are. Not very useful for me........."
3,Good book for the basics,I purchased this book to pick-up a few more pointers. The book was good but all the graphics/forms are drawn. Would be better with actual photographs.
2,Cheap,"Bearing and rim breaks easily, should only use it for a wagon. Or weld the rim other to make it stronger"
2,"Disappointed, but good in theory","I drive a 98' Jeep Wrangler and found the only cup holder it fits is out of the drivers view. The cradle is very loose and unstable. The additional mounting bracket is again a good idea but we found no location on the dash in which it would work, nor would it work well in my husbands 01' Jetta. I've set it aside for now, hoping we can find a use for it someday."
2,Eh...,"The main character in the novel, Sean Drummond, is an endearing protagonist with a smart sense of humor. The dialogue is sharp and easy to read. I would definitely be interested in reading other books about Drummond, as he is likeable and humorous.However, the plot of this particular novel is rather weak and has more holes than swiss cheese. Unfortunately the book concludes with several loose ends and doesn't really deliver the ""punch line"" with enough power. In the end, this book was a disappointment."
5,Explosive,Briand Haig know his stuff.Every thing is well documented and the storyis very believable.Stunning ending
5,If you like Mitch Rapp you will like Sean Drummond,"My first Brian Haig book and its definately won't be the last. From the very first page I was hooked. Sean Drummond is smart, tough and a wiseass. Finally, a character I can like. So who is killing the high ranking officials? Well, you'll never guess. I have to say that finally meeting the main villans was rather dissapointing. I'd expected someone a lot smarter and more suave(of couse, the mastermind is all that and more, but still...). This was the only flaw in this otherwise excellent book."
2,I can't believe I finished this book.,"I've not read any of the other books in this series, so maybe I don't have the allegiance or tolerance that others have built up. I found this book to be awful. The dialogue made me cringe. A constant stream of socially inappropriate one-liners that weren't the least bit funny (and wouldn't be in any setting). It's like the author was far too pleased with himself. The plot was decent, if predictable, and that's the only reason I give it two stars."
1,Did the author write all those favorable reveiws?,"A terrible read...the worst of 2005 for my wife and me. Since the book has NOT ""taken off"" I tend to disbelieve all those highly favorable reviews by my fellow voters. (Think ulcer on that point!) First 1% of novel is great. Last 1% is good. Middle 98% is a sewer of words leading no where except to boredom. Perhaps a good short-short story as written but no novel. A favorable note....it sells for a good price used. (Probably because of availability as so few real people are reading it.)"
1,A page turner,"yes - a page turner. I kept turning the pages because I couldn't believe that the writing could get worse. It did. I made it thru page 137 and gave up. The main character, Sean Drummond, comes across as a real jerk - a combination lawyer and military man with the worst traits of both. A silly plot, cardboard characters, need I say more? If you can borrow a copy (for God's sake don't buy one!) read a few pages for comic relief. People buy this author's books which proves that H.L. Mencken was right: ""No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public."""
1,Too Many Wisecracks.,"This was my first Brian Haig novel and probably my last. His insider Washington knowledge made for an interesting story which could have been very readable. However, the main character, Sean Drummond, comes across like a wannabe Spenser from the Robert Parker series. Normally, I enjoy a healthy dose of humor in a novel, but Drummond's wisecracks are just too over the top considering the setting. I mean, get real -- in the first chapter six innocent people have been murdered, but Drummond certainly doesn't seem to be taking it very seriously. His continuous ""humorous"" comments are totally inappropriate.I think Brian Haig needs to rethink his main character's personality and give him a little sensitivity."
1,"Who is this Haig guy, anyhow?","This was the first Haig book I've read, and truthfully I can't even say I've read it, since I abandoned the tripe a third of the way into it. It's insipid and vulgar. The characters are shallow people I wouldn't hire to walk my dog, let alone protect the president. The dialog is juvenile and repetitive and I lost count of the number of problems/issues I found in the plot. Haig might be a successful author, but only because W. C. Fields was right."
5,Great Read,The title of this story had me a little worried about what kind of story this might be. I was pleasantly surprised as I read the book and I heartedly recommend it!
4,"Title is a bit off, but the story is right on.","The very title of this book is misleading. It suggests that the President of the United States is the predominant character in the book. It does not become the case at any point. It is the President's Chief of Staff who ultimately becomes the focus on what is a more broad conspiracy whereby the President is supposedly (based on some piece of paper) the ultimate target.The real plot is in how various other persons (including a Supreme Court justice) start dying left & right. It becomes a vast extortion plot that takes twists and turns along the way. The book should be called something else, but what's inside the book means more than the outside, so I don't dock too many points for that."
5,Haig is in charge!,"For some reason, although I follow approximately 50 authors, I had not read Brian Haig's work. Well, I corrected that after reading this book, I ordered all his previous works. No wonder I keep Amazon in business!The reason this book captivated me is not only because of the nonstop action (although it was easy to figure 'who dunit'), is Haig's writing style is smooth and writes like Nelson DeMille, which ain't bad...I will have to add Haig to my list. Which will make Amazon quite happy.This is an excellent read and you almost cannot put it down it moves so quickly.Worth the hardback -"
5,Absolutely Outstanding,My first book by Haig and not my last.Keeps your attention from page one and has more twists and turns than a pretzel factory.A genuine thriller and Sean leads the pack and with great humor and sarcasm.The ending is priceless and unique. Haig is a keeper and so are his books.Read the dust cover if you want a review and then buy it.
5,Great Cooking Fun,"I just got this and my kids love it. We bought this because it was small and didn't take up a ton of room like a full play stove. My kids have been wanting a play kitchen, but with four kids and a tiny apartment, there just wasn't the room for one. I like that it's self contained and small for storage purposes. So when they want to play they only have to dig it out and set it up but it's easily stored on a shelf when it's not in use. I also like that it's wood vs plastic. I'm trying to get away from plastic toys whenever possible. I bought a Super Baking Set and a Super Cooking Set for their utensils. I like the qaulity of those as well. All items from both sets fit into the stove for storage minus the little measuring cup. It would have fit but it was just a bit too high. I fully plan on buying more Alex cooking fun."
3,Product photos are misleading,"I guess I didn't read the fine print because I made my decision to purchase this solely because it appeared to include a set of toy metal cookware, as shown in all the photos. Boy, was that a disappointment when there were no accessories included! The stove itself is essentially a painted wooden box with simple knobs on the front -- not much realism or detail -- but it's cute anyway."
4,Good story telling,"Scudder paints a nice picture of grimy new york life as a backdrop to an interesting plot. I liked the overall narrative, but also the mini episodes where Scudder interacts and exchanges stories with the other characters. Definitely not a waste of time."
2,"Compare to his old works, this one is totally unreadable!!!!","I've always worried about an author once he becomes rich and famous. Because once he is too successful and cashing in too much, his writing inspiration would soon be jarred by his own glory. This book plus his BURGLAR's series(a ridiculous creation like Lawrance Sanders' McNally series) are the proof that the once great writer is going downhill in a 35 degree angle. Very bad writing and plotting with lot of flaws. Simply TERRIBLE"
1,Busted Block,"A boring pastiche of ""koko"" (Peter Straub) and ""10 little indians"" (Agatha Christie) with the best parts missing. The rest of the plot is a dreary Alcoholic Anonymous polemic. Avoid."
3,Not the best,"It's a good reading, but compared to the expectation concerning the title, it's actionless. The last 50 or 60 pages are very good, but the others are very slow. By the way, I liked it and will probably read other Block's book."
2,A Long Line of Dead Men,"One of Block's works that takes a while to get into to and then it's hard to put down. I am a huge Block fan; however, this book certainly isn't his best. I would recommend reading it, as with everything Block does, it's worth it."
3,Great small gift idea.,Do not let the picture mislead you. The color beads that come along with the harmonica may be a different color other then blue. For example the color beads I received were pink... unfortunately I shipped this to a friend of mine. (who happens to be a boy..and not quite into pink). Great small gift idea however beware..it may be pink!
3,"Plays, btu not well","This is just something I like to wear for fun around town some days, but its a little juvenille and I have outgrown it (I'm in college). I bought this because I play the harmonica and thought I could play around with it for fun when I am bored, but its disappointing. The sound is not too good and the cord sucked, so I changed it out, but it still looks cheap."
2,disappointing,"I have had mini-harmonicas in the past that played their limited range quite nicely. These do not. They are hard to play (especially the notes one plays by breathing in), and the tone is tinny and even somewhat out of tune. I was quite disappointed, and realize I need to be willing to pay more."
1,PINK.... WHY PINK,"Im a boy... why in the hell world, i would use a pink necklace, i will not return it becuase im goimg to give it to a friend. but im very sat..."
4,Great bag!,"This bag was exactly what I needed, but only after I altered it. I didn't need a place for my laptop, but I needed the additional room it gave me over the 904, so I just purchased the additional sectioning available through Amazon and made it the bag I needed, with the laptop bag taken out. Very functional!"
2,Not what I ordered,i was not happy when I received this product. The picture on the website clearly shows 2 eyelets at the bottom of the floormat to be able to fit over the hook in the floor of my vehicle.(to keep it form sliding) When I received the floormat set they were obviously a cheaper knock off without the eyelets.
4,"Great DVD Collection, Good Price/ You cant beat the pice!","I love the Devil Lady! I started out watching Devil Man and eventually moved on to Devil Lady. It starts out with the story over a model who becomes the devil lady. You see her transformation from quite reserved woman to the demon woman as the series progresses. I paid around $30 bucks for each DVD in the 6 DVD. I wish that I would have known that the price was going to be so cheap for the whole series. I say go for it, you have nothing to lose. This is a good story, it will captivate you and have you wondering what is going to happen next!"
1,Pure junk,"Got it brand new on Christmas. The second lap of the track the smoke unit overheates and causes the smokestack to melt distort and cave in, the front of the boiler is distorted."
3,Read the description carefully,"I was in a hurry when I ordered this. Somehow, I thought this would be a handy desktop *alternative* to the plug-in adapters I've been using, but instead, it's a *supplement*.You still need an adapter (not included) to be plugged into this ""charging"" stand, and frankly, the slightest wobble of the unit if you move papers around or jiggle the table could stop the recharging process even though it's still sitting there and giving you the false impression that its being charged. Then, when you grab it and suddenly find it's low on power, you might not like this device at all.However, I do give it 3 stars because it DOES function beautifully -- within the context of what it's meant for -- without a hitch."
3,"OK, Just",This book held my attention for most of it. When I got round to the final chapters I almost put it aside but having invested time in reading it I continued to the end. I found the end confusing and not very satisfactory for that reason only three stars.
3,Hard to believe he wrote this book,"The plot was fun and interesting, and could have been done in about 70 pages. The rest of the book was mindless filler.For instance, he describes exactly how Grace tricks her son into eating more fruit and less cereal by sneaking more and more banana into his dish. What does this have to do with the story? Quite frankly, I think he hired a housewife somewhere to fill in the pages between the 70 relevant ones. I had to skim about 40% of it. It's sad when pressure from the publisher makes good writers turn out drivel."
3,worth reading,"i've read all of harlan coben's books, and while just one look is not his best, it's certainly a fast-paced read. the novel is a bit far-fetched and not as well grounded as his previous works, but the pace will have you finished rather quickly. needless to say i'll still look forward to coben's future works."
1,A MAJOR disappointment,"I have read most of Coben's books and particularly enjoyed ""Tell No One"" and ""No Second Chance"".In fact, I was so excited I ordered an autographed copy immediately upon learning of the book.I made a mistake. This book is very shallow and just not of the caliber of previous efforts.After 50 pages or so, I realized things would not likely get better and that proved to be accurate. In previous books, you can hardly wait to turn the page and hope the book never ends.In this one, you debate whether to turn a page or close the book.Just One Look is a good title, take a look and pass it by."
2,boring,"I had to force myself to finish this monstrosity. The storyline involving a strange photograph seemed like a good one at the start, but the nonsense about a riot at a rock concert years ago just didn't grab my attention the way the author intended. Sorry, just didn't work for me. I found the end of the story ridiculous too."
3,Good but a little draggy,"This is my second Harlan Coben book and i'm still undecided if I enjoyed this as I did the first one I read (Tell No One). I agree the plot of the book started out great and I was pretty much hooked, wanting to know - who are these people in the picture, why was 'Jack' taken etc. Though threw out the book i was waiting to find out whats going on; but he seem to have left almost EVERYTHING for the last pages. So I have to agree when some people said some things could have been left out. He definitely could've gotten to the point a lot faster than he did. Though all in all the ending story line was good. Though i'm hoping the next Harlan Coben book I read will be somewhat more entertaining like ""Tell No One""."
3,One Look was Enuf!!!,"Very tight plot; very tense and the Wu character was the scariest in quite a while. Hope I never run into him.Overall, there was too much description of mundane things (feeding kids breakfast and dwelling too much on it) but overall a fairly good read. 'Gone for Good' and 'No Second Chance' were better but I will continue to read H.C. from time to time. Try Dennis Lehane also!!!"
3,"Not his best, but fun.","This is another of Harlan's fast-paced, page-turning stories. I loved the strong character of Grace but the bad guys were flat and stereotypical and the story seemed overly-complicated. Although I don't feel this is one of his best, it still a fun ride."
2,Impressed and yet not,"This was my first Harlan Coben book and it was a page turner in that I was compelled to find out how all the strands of the story fit together. However, the book was frustrating in parts where Coben would digress into the minutiae of some of the characters lives and their thought processes; I just wanted him to get on with the plot.The opening of the book grabbed my attention, but after a time the introduction of character after character was too much; I was thankful that Beatrice Smith didn't make an appearance. I felt let down and disappointed when I finished the book. There was this sense of 'Is that it? Was that all it was about?'"
4,"Good, Not Great","This book is not as fun as Harlan's previous books. I enjoyed it, but it did not enthrall me the way his last four books have. I still look forward to his books in the future."
1,Could barely read this book,"Had to put it down after just the first couple of chapters. Will probably throw it away. Typographical, grammatical, and expositional errors were so numerous that they became a complete distraction to enjoying the story. This novel is very poorly written and it appears that it was not edited at all.I do not recommend it, and I hate to give it the one star rating that I gave it."
4,MIND NUMBING THRILL RIDE,"I picked up one day and finished the next (and I'm not a fast reader). Mr. Coben gives his usual twists, turns, subplots and false leads. He does a reasonably good job of fleshing out the characters (for a thriller/ mystery). He keeps you guessing until the end. No deep thoughts just a MIND NUMBING THRILL RIDE. Perfect for summer."
4,Harlan's dry sense of humor missing in this one,I looked forward to Harlan Coben's new book and I thought it was interesting and I love any book with plot twists galore. The only negative is that it was not as funny as his other books. Maybe he was trying to make the female character more serious than his other main characters in previous books. I will still read all of his future novels as he is my favorite new author.
2,I miss the old stuff,"I loved the old Myron Bolitar Series. Read ""Deal Breaker"" or ""Drop Shot"" to see Coben at his best. Just my opionion (and maybe my taste. I hope he brings them back."
2,Harlan Coben can do better,"This book was just too unbelievable. Long married people who know nothing about eachother. A wife who is reluctant to approach her husband when she sees an ""old"" picture of him and another girl in a group of young people. Too many unrealistic subplots with ""surprise"" explanations which make little sense and are way too convenient. An old rock concert where many young people are killed and thier parents are still walking zombies unable to cope with their deaths 15 years later. A mafia ""sugar daddy"" savior who always appears at just the right time. It is all too mundane, like a soap opera, and boring. Harlan Coben has written some good books. I am presently reading ""The Innocent"". I hope it does not end like ""Just One Look""."
4,Just One Look,"Talk about twists and turns....in ""Just One Look"" Coban has pulled out all the stops. Here we have a devoted wife with two children whose husband has disappeared and the police are no help in finding him. When Grace Lawson looks into her missing husband's past, she is totally disturbed when she finds that their pasts are inexplicably intertwined. Then the fun of unravelling these pasts presents itself and its solution.This is an ingeniously intriguing story presented by a master storyteller who introduces so many twists and turns you are at a loss to determine whether you are coming or going. The book is engrossing, and you can't put it down until you have finished reading it. Have a good read.E.J.Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
2,Great Start - Poor finish,"Starts off good but then gets muddled in the middle. By the end I didn't really care about the characters or the story. The villain in the book seems infallible until the very end when he proves to be incompetent. Coben is a good author and I've enjoyed most everything he has written, except this book."
2,It could be much better,The plot is kind of thrilling if you can find it because is so long-winded that you can skip several pages in a row and never miss anything important.
2,condescending author leaves me cold,"The story is good, the plot a bit overdone, but the manner of the author in speaking/writing about TJMax customers & condominiums, etc tells me he has these one liners he wants to impart on the public...his own thoughts about the middle class (who are his readers?)I won't bother to read him again."
3,"Complex, fascinating, but sterile","This book came highly recommended, and that's the power of advertising, I guess. Still, JOL was an interesting read. The mystery is deep, complex, and Coben takes care to tie up all the threads. But for me, I never get a chance to invest in the characters because I'm so busy keeping track of the plot. I got to the end of it and thought, so what?The book comes seriously close to matching wits with the likes of Koontz (quit groaning) and Patterson, but despite its technical sharpness, it just barely misses the mark for me."
2,Just not that good,"Grace Lawson picks up her developed roll of film only to find a strange 15 year old picture of her husband and friends stuck in the middle of the roll. When she confronts him with it he leaves the house and disappears without a trace. Drama involving bad guys ensues. The remainder cannot be easily described because it is completely unbelievable, and not in a shocking suspensful way.This was my second attempt at a Coben book and I have confirmed that I'm just not a fan. His books are mindless entertainment which is fine with me, but the plots are ridiculous to the point of distraction. Just One Look's story is so contrived that it makes it difficult to enjoy. I'm a big fan of the ""whodoneit"" genre, but Coben is not for me."
4,mixed review,"I found myself hooked by this book and the feeling lasted...until three quarters of the way through the novel. At that point I became a bit disappointed. I feel that the author got off track and did not know how to bring together a believable closing. Things got convoluted and there were too many convenient events and coincidences. I felt let down by the ending. However, the book is still very entertaining and I recommend it. It would be a good book to read on the beach...I agree that the book is poorly edited but I don't fault the author for that."
3,Second-rate Coben,"I agree with Eric's review - Gone For Good and Tell No One were the sort of great books that keep you reading until 3am. Just One Look is in a different (lesser) league. Terrific beginning, then it all goes downhill.The plot doesn't really make sense, and I've read far too many crime novels where the hero or heroine happens to have a Mafia boss on tap to help them out when the going gets rough (I'm thinking of the Spenser novels in particular). Grace was a pleasant enough character but the endless stuff about how much she loved her kids, what they ate, what they wore, what they were reading and so on got very tedious. And is it just me or are his folksy little authorial asides (er, um) becoming really irritating?This is a harsh review, because a new Harlan Coben is still a treat. But this is really not that great."
2,I agree with Skip It--This one is awful,"I have enjoyed all of Coben's work but this one certainly had me wondering what kind of changes success is making in his attitudes. I couldn't decide who he had more contempt for: his own characters or me as the reader. This story was contrived, unbelievable, and unsatisfying. His tacked on surprise ending casting Grace in a dark role in her own tragedy was distasteful to say the least. His careless and senseless killing off of one person after another was even more so. The truth certainly didn't set any of these people free, everyone in the story was left impoverished and diminished, and for what? All in all the whole story just left me with a very bad taste in my mouth."
3,Just One Look,"This was a little hard to follow on audio, however, once I could remember who each character was, it became a very interesting story.This was a first read for this author for me and I won't hesitate to pick up another book by him.The story was very in depth, sometimes too much, however, had a pretty decent ending. It certainly wasn't predictable!It seemed to me that there were too many characters to follow and keep up with and I don't think the story would have lacked any without a few of them.I had a rough time in the beginning, however, became very interested throughout the middle of the book. I also believe that if I would have read the story rather than listened to it, that it would have been easier to get into and stay with the story."
4,A fun page-turner,"I enjoyed reading the novel despite the violence it portrayed. The plot is complex and the characters realistic. I particularly enjoyed the setting in Northern New Jersey, an area I am familiar with."
5,Love,"I love his books, all of the ones that I read. And this one is not an exception. I totally recommend it."
3,Good read.,"Not as dynamic as some, but still a good read. Maybe I have read too many procedural books. I had to keep reading to see how they got away or not."
4,Unrealistic But A Good Read,"This book's ending is a little unrealistic but it's still not a bad read. I love Harlan Coben's books but this isn't one of his best. The thing is if someone else would have written this book then I would have thought it was a pretty good book. So even though I have very high standards for Mr. Coben, I still have to give this book a good review. I enjoy the build up of the book but felt like he really rushed the ending. I did find the twists and turns that Coben is known for to be exciting but I wish there would have been more throughout the book instead of having most of them at the end. Overall, this is a quick read that will for the most part keep you interested. I would recommend this book to mystery readers."
5,keeps you guessing,"This was a great book. Although you are kept guessing I would say that all the loose ends are tied up in the end. It was not predictable so that by the middle of the book you are able to put the pieces together. Was it believable? Some reviewers thought the story line was a bit far-fetched. I didn't find it far-fetched per-se, perhaps improbable, but its fiction. I didn't expect it to read like a newspaper. I think the fact that it was so unexpected added to the suspense. Just don't start reading this if you have work the next day. You will not want to put it down."
3,Not one of Coben's best,"I enjoy Coben's books--they always have a surprise ending and usually one that's totally unexpected--this one is no exception. However, I found this book entirely too crammed with characters. This was not a book I couldn't bear to put down and then could hardly wait to pick up again. Tell No One, Gone for Good and No Second Chance were much better reads!"
1,Soccer Moms,"If only Harlan would go back to what he does best, that is writing about Myron Bolitar or at least, something clever and amusing. This latest offering by Mr. Coben is the most commercial and uninteresting book yet. He obviously wants to appeal to all the soccer and stay at home moms out there who want to read about one of their own involved in a mystery. However, we really don't care about her, her husband or her neighbors. That's what this book is about, with an Asian murderer thrown in. The characters are not worth reading, or caring about. It took me about 4 attempts to finally finish this mess. Don't get me wrong, I love Harlan Coben books, having read them all, but this one is downright painful to read. Hopefully he will go back to his old style and former characters. However, if people keep clammering for this type of pap, then again, maybe he won't."
4,great story but...,"I really enjoyed the book, just as satisfying as the rest. I listen to all of them while driving around Los Angeles for work. my only comment would be that I prefer when the actor's read books, rather than authors. Great book overall."
3,Not my favorite,"This book is by far not his best.....the plot is too complicated and very hard to follow.....the last few chapters finally bring everything together but it's tough getting that far...usually I can't put his books down, had a hard time not doing that this time...hope the next one is better"
4,IF YOU LIKE LABYRINTHS,"This was my third Harlan Coben novel, after Tell No One and No Second Chance. Despite the thrills and chills, I couldn't quite connect with the characters. If you never identify with the main characters in some essential way, it's hard to care what ultimately happens to them. Some indefinable magnetism was missing this time. That's all I can blame. The plot and dialogue were as inventive as ever."
4,Deserves a Serious Look,"Never reading Coben's work before, I was intrigued by the story line of Just One Look and decided to pick it up. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised and finished the book in two days. Just One Look is a rapid page turner that I had trouble putting down for even a moment. Employing a strong central character in Grace, a suburban mom of two kids, coping with the rapid disappearance of her husband after discovering a mysterious photo depicting him twenty years earlier, Coben briskly, yet suspensefully, unravels the mystery of a related event in both Grace's and her husband Jack's lives that affects them forever. Just One Look is an exciting journey with enough twists and turns to keep you flipping pages. The final 30 pages that pulls the story together is refreshing, surprising, and intelligently designed by Coben."
1,A Truly Awful Story,"This book was unbelievably bad. The author is a horrible writer and I have no idea how this made it onto the New York Times bestseller list. One of the things that made it especially frustrating was how he would constantly meander off topic to mention something completely mundane and unrelated to the plot. I specifically remember a dramatic chase scene in a supermarket where the author pauses to inform the reader why a supermarket keeps the milk and eggs at the back of the store.Because I was truly desparate for reading materiel, I finished this book. Trust me, it was not worth it. The characters were shallow and the scary mystery is not so scary after all. Avoid this book."
3,Nice start going slowly down hill,I have read all of Mr Coben's books and this is probably the least enjoyable.I dont mean to dwell on the editing but its really terrible. The main reason I am writing at all to ask where is Myron Bolitar? That was the best series that I have read in a long time and why have you given up on M. B. Why does everyone want to fix what isnt broke??
3,a bit too complex,"The twists, turns, and number of characters were just too much. There was definitely a surprise ending though. I'd recommend Coben's latest thriller, The Innocent over this book.(...)"
3,Fast paced fun with a major plot error.,"I really enjoyed this book, as I have many of Coben's. But as the mysteries are revealed in this convoluted story, a major plot error is also. Coben really muffed this one and as soon as I find his website I've just got to ask him about it! I don't want to spoil the story line for anyone, but the error involves the photograph and how the people in it are identified. Anyone else catch this? It made me crazy!!"
1,Will the Real Harlan Coben Please Stand Up?,"Is this the same Harlan Coben I've come to know and love? The Harlan Coben who gave us Myron Bolitar?Ugh.I'm about halfway through ""Just One Look"" and ready to cast it aside. This reads like the first-draft, fourth-rate, churn-'em-out dreck that litters bestseller lists (think Nora Roberts or Danielle Steel). Where's the trademark Coben snappy dialog? the informed insider's slant on topics like professional sports? the twisting yet plausible plots? the smart cynicism tinged with heart and style? Where's Big Cindy when we really need her?Harlan, we hardly knew ye."
3,Not Coben's Best,"Harlan Coben is one of my favorite authors, but this is not his best. The story never engages the reader, and perhaps even more annoying, are all the typos in the book. A few typos would be understandable, but 30-plus is unexcusable in a major novel. The typos start in the book's second sentence (""stuck in that the (sic) lull when the music first starts..."") , and continue throughout the book up to the third-to-last page (""I know all about it. I've seen in it (sic) lots of cases."") and second-to-last page (""He didn't go [] (sic) the concert""). Even in spots where the book starts to mount some suspense, the appearance of yet another typo yanks the reader out of the book and ruins the suspense. It almost seems like the uncorrected proof got published as a hardcover. (Harlan, get a new copy editor!!!) I can only hope that his next book will be better."
4,"Contrived, yes ... but try and put it down!","After a sleepless night gobbling up my first Coben novel, ""The Innocent,"" I rushed out and bought this one. And once again I was compelled to finish it in one day. Yes, the criticisms of other reviewers are valid. The plot is confusing and contrived, and the ending leaves you somewhat flat. Many characters aren't fully fleshed out. However, Coben does an excellent job with Grace and Charlaine, two strong, resourceful women. I was moved by his dead-on depictions of the special love parents have for their children. And his numerous pop culture references ring true. Most important, ""Just One Look"" is an exciting read that's impossible to put down ... which, in the end, is job one when writing an escapist mystery."
2,"OK, Where did Harlen Coben go? This can't be HIS book!","A lousy book. Having read the three books by Harlen Coben before this, I was relishing digging into this one. Those books kept me on edge--I literally couldn't stop turning the pages.This one, however, was a chore to get through. The continuity was horrible. The characters weren't very likeable. And the plot twists were, well, too twisty, like when you twist a piece of taffy too much and it gets so thin it falls apart. That's exactly what happens to this plot. It just falls apart.Somebody (it couldn't have possibly been the talented author of the previous novels, could it?) overworked this one to death!"
1,Bad to the bone,"When I was about halfway through this book, I knew something was not right with it. Since Coben is a favorite of mine, I kept wondering: Did Coben really write this? So I came online to read other readers' reviews. That was helpful, especially the one- and two-star reviews, because those reviewers were saying the same things I was thinking as I was reading. Their reviews convinced me that it wasn't me - I wasn't crazy - and to plod on, realizing the book probably wasn't going to get any better, but I was curious enough to want to know just how bad it would turn out to be. The answer? BAD. Really, really bad."
1,just one look...yeah,"My first Coben book was a disappointment. The storyline started pretty good for this reader, but somewhere along the middle I got bored and realized I made a bad choice."
2,"Decent start, weak ending","In the end, the characters are just not believable. Enjoyed the first third of the book and had to push myself to finish it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,Classic Coben,"This book is classic Coben...put your hands up and enjoy the ride. Coben puts you through twists and twists and although I guessed one of the major twists at the end, I was completely baffled about the rest. Coben makes you want to read his book a second time and see what you missed; he's great! Although this book is not quite as good as ""Tell No One"" and ""Gone For Good,"" it ranks up there with ""No Second Chance."" For everybody that thinks that this Coben book was not as good as his others, just remember that it is still better than 90% other books out there."
4,A Page Turner,"I have, yet, to find the perfect mystery novel, but Coben's books are fairly close. They grab your interest from the start, throw enough red herrings at you to keep you guessing, and are an easy read.The plot in this book was well thought out. It makes sense, which is a compliment considering how many of today's mysteries leave such large holes in their plots that at the end you are more confused than satisfied.I bought the hardback version and it was worth the price."
3,"Too many plots, too many characters","This is the first book by this author that I have read and while I found it enjoyable, I gave it three stars for the following reasons: One, too many characters which I found daunting. I feel a list of them at the front of the book would have been very helpful. Second,too many plots to keep track of. I may read another book by this author with hopes that subsequent books don't contain these flaws."
5,Another Fantastic Read From Harlan!,"This author's characterization is never a disappointment. They are always fully-fleshed and leaping off the page. To me, this is a big plus when reading this kind of book. As always, the author unravels the plot with professional expertise, throwing in the odd blinder to keep you guessing. I can't recommend Mr Coben's books enough. He is a brilliant writer. Buy it!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"i was really excited starting this book with really high expectionas, but was disappointed. it started off pretty slow, and when i finally thought it was starting to pick up, it didn't go anywhere. finally i put it down, and didnt go back to it."
3,Let's make this simple...,"I loved the book up until the end. I can see how everything tied together the author wrapped it up quite nicely even though it was a reach. Now the very ending....what?!...why throw that in there, what is that going to do to wrap up the story? This was the first Coben book I have read, are they all like this? I may attempt another one, but I want be in a hurry to do so. The twist at the end just left a bad taste in my mouth, I see no reason for it to be put in the story other than making the reader go, hmmm."
2,"Twisted Plot, Twisted Prose","This guy needs to go take a creative writing class.The plot is somewhat interesting, but the writing style is rough. Coben constantly interrupts the story, going off on some insanely boring tangent, with no relation to the plot.When he introduces a new character, he buries us with pages of the character's biography. Throughout the novel, he puts us to sleep by dedicating several paragraphs to minutiae, such as the entire morning routine of a mother that has to feed her children and send them off to school (3 pages!). I guess he doesn't have enough to say, and has to fill the pages with something.This book could have used a good editor."
2,Middle-class thriller,"I have read several Bolitar books, and a few of Coben's stand-alone books. This one falls into his ""middle-class thriller"" genre, where people just like you and me find themselves thrown into mysterious and/or deadly plots. The set-up of the plot is fine, but there are so many red herrings and tangled plot threads that it becomes hard to keep up with where Coben is taking us. At the end you'll be saying ""huh?"" or maybe ""duh.""I got the feeling I was being ""written down to,"" as if he were trying too hard to show that he knows all about what life is like for parents and kids in suburbia. And you'll note that he makes more than one reference to characters in his Bolitar series. This one is not worth the time you'll take to read it."
3,Sweet Lonesome,"The review above seems to take for granted a prejudice against country people and bluegrass music--my question is: if you don't like sweet annd honest twang, what on earth are you doing buying a blugrass disc? Perhaps if the author had seen Matewan or Coal Miner's Daughter as well as Deliverance, the poignancy of true American folk music wouldn't have been lost on him or her.I confess that I've always had a soft spot for John Denver despite his cheesy fan base (see above)--perhaps it has something to do with that Muppets Christmas album I still adore--and to be able to hear his sweet, simple tunes as rendered in banjo, dobro, lap steel, hammer dulcimer and such is truly a joy.I recommend this disc to you if you're the sort of person who respects the twang and have ever (perhaps shamefacedly) enjoyed getting Annie's Song stuck in your head."
1,Deliverance Meets Denver: A Bluegrass Butchering,"I bought this CD thinking that it was one of the many releases of Mr. Denver's songs that popped up everywhere following his tragic death. I, like so many of my generation, can relate events and people we were with when we first heard a particular song of Mr. Denver's. His music moved us and touched our hearts. I am the first to admit that I should have read the description of the album before purchasing it. This is not an album by John Denver. It is an attempt to turn his songs into hillbilly, barn dancing, bluegrass. One does not truly know the meaning of pain until they have listened to Annie's Song: You Fill Up My Senses being played on a banjo like the theme song from the movie Deliverance. On the other hand, if you enjoy sitting back in a rocking chair with a jug of moonshine this album is right up your alley. Needless to say I was not only disappointed but horrified at the way Mr. Denver's music was butchered."
1,save your money,These are very cute but they don't stand up to dog-play. My corgi eviscerated the Hartz toys within minutes. I have found the only stuffed toys that last are the AKC or the CKC brands.
2,"Cheap made, material tears easily!","Cheap made and the material is really thin and tears easily! Although my dog loved the quack which is different to the squeek, it really wasn't that loud a quack. Disappointed and duck is now buried somewhere in the yard...not work the effort to go dig it up. Cheap and short lived, not worth the money!"
2,Didn't last long,Had this product for about 5 minutes when my dog Lucy who never eats up her toys ripped out the noise maker in the throat. Save your money!!
2,My dog's favorite toy ... but it doesn't last long.,"My miniature schnauzer absolutely loves this duck. It's by far his favorite toy. He'd definitely give it 5 stars. The ""quacker"" is far more intriguing to him than a normal squeaker toy.Unfortunately, these don't last too long. He typically has them torn apart in a few weeks. He's probably been through 8-10 of these things in the past year and a half. Fortunately, eating some of the stuffing hasn't seemed to hurt him at all. The longest we've had one go was probably 2 months. Others have been ripped to shreds in days.I'd only recommend it if your dog is not a chewer and you actively monitor the condition of its toys."
3,Great Dog Toy,"I've bought 3 of these in the past 1.5 years. The first one came home with my new 10 week old standard poodle.It stayed in great shape for the first year until we adopted a 1 year old chihuahua. She is a TOY killer. The ducks are both still playable but she ripped at a seam until it finally broke open. One is in decent shape, the other is deflated. The 3rd one is MIA and I suspect she's hidden it. lolI've thrown them in the washer a lot, but we warned that after a few dryer trips the quacker will no longer work. They wash up great though.So, I'd rate them a 2-4 for durability. It really does depend on your dog. My poodle never destroyed toys until the chihuahua came along. Now she does it too- every stuffed toy.They are well made, but if you have a persistent toy killer it will eventually get ruined."
2,disappointed,"Got this and was immediately disappointed - I couldn't make it produce a noise and naturally the pup had to run over and help me. She wasn't able to make it quack either. She likes chasing it, but we both were disappointed in the silence."
3,"Loved it, but ate it","Bailee is a small beagle, like 15 pounds. This was a somewhat considerable toy for her size, but she loves larger stuffed toys over the smaller ones. I thought this seemed like a pretty great toy (with the 'life-like' duck sounds.) Bailee loved it too, but it only lasted about 3 days before she got the squeeker out. She has tons of toys, and has only gotten the squeeker out of a couple. So needless to say, I won't buy this again, but she did love it."
1,Wast of money!,"This is a waste of money! My dogs loved it a little too much! the squeeker was the first to go throught he back, then the stomach was ripped open and I had stuffing everywhere! SAve your money and get the stuffing-less cheapo from the dollar store. too bad, it is very cute!"
4,Fun toy for a non-destructive chewers,"I actually got 2 of these for my dogs at Walmart for about $3 each. One of my dogs loves duck toys, and it works very well for him because he doesn't chew to destroy. However, it is a plush toy, so my other dog (who is a semi-destructive chewer, depending on her mood) tore them apart in a matter of minutes."
1,My Quackers Don't,"I ordered 2 of these stuffed duck dog toys for the ""grand"" dogs.Neither one of them has a ""quacker"" that works. If it wasn't soclose to our Christmas get together, they would be going right backto Amazon. I actually feel a bit ripped off, paying close to $10.00for a dog toy that doesn't work, it's the quacker that makes it afun toy, if it were one of them, i would think, darn I got a bad one,but when both don't work, I wonder how many of the ones sold actuallydid work. Hmmmm"
1,Good i guess.,Just ok. Not really a game changer. Has some really great places but its full of very old just average eateries.
2,does not scan properly,"I purchased the C7046A attachment for my HP1200 Laserjetprinter.Here are the pros and cons:-The attachment does a good job for copying pages . It operates ata fairly good speed and the quality of the copy is good.-The attachment does a poor job when scanning pages for email purposes such as conversion to pdf form . The scanner works at very slow speed which could not be tolerated in a business setting. I clocked it at 2-3 ppm. Compare this to Fujitsu Scansnaps 18ppm. With the HP attachment you get a below average looking text in the pdf file even at higher quality settings. It looks somewhat blurry. It is difficult to impossible to read some of the text, and definitely should not be used for business or personal. The attachment Director software also tends to need a reboot every 2 or 3 scans. This means turning off, unplugging the printer, or rebooting the computer."
4,Wow!!!,"I've got to order this - it sounds great! How many plots have involved the Nazis wandering into the jungle, the Yucatan or the Valley of the Kings She walks thru fire? Shades of Ming the Merciless and Queen Azura. f.w."
5,This battery works best for the 3390...,"I just received it yesterday, and I charged it to full capacity then. It hasn't gone down at all yet, and I've been using it a lot today. My original battery would've been halfway down by now. So, it works really well. I highly recommend it."
2,Battery for NOKIA Cell Phone,The product appears to be working quite well. I am satisfied with the product.
1,Not *NEW* as advertised,"This was advertised as ""Brand new OEM Nokia battery BLC-2""I don't believe these are new batteries. The first one I received had half the life of my original two year old battery. The RMA replacement that I received gives a low battery warning on the first call. It dies on the second.Neither battery arrived in original packaging.I am not impressed and have made a claim on Amazon.com A-to-z Guarantee.I would rate this item a zero, but I am forced to give it a one in order to post this review."
5,First time user,"This was the first time I used your service but it woun't be the last. I had a really hard time finding what I was looking for until I dialed up your site and there it was. I was also impressed with the price, about 30% less expensive than everything else I could find. It arrived in two days and was exactly what I wanted, Thanks Amazon. com.Thanks Don"
1,Not shipping new batteries,"It's fairly simple: CCMAccessories is clearly shipping used batteries, contrary to the assertion on the product page that they are new. I just got mine today and the life is terrible and there were plenty of cosmetic blemishes showing that it was obviously not what I bargained for. I do not recommend purchasing from them, and I'm lodging a complaint w/ Amazon."
1,Hmmmm,"The battery was without a charge when I bought it as expected. What was not expected was that the battery would not take a charge. I verified part numbers, etc. Maybe the mili-amp hour rating being different was the issue. In any case I do not know whether it was the battery or my fault."
5,1000MAH LI-ION BATTERY,Item was shipped promptly and works super.Battery was expertly packaged to prevent damage during transit.Look forward to buying from this seller again. 5 Stars !
2,weak storyline,"Impostors being the main storyline made the novel a very far-fetched fictional. However, I did enjoy the tidbits of information scattered throughout such as Lemonade Lucy, tarantulas not being web-spinners, and tee-totaler Stonewall Jackson. If one gets past the impersonation storyline, book is an entertaining read."
2,weak storyline,"Impostors being the basic backbone of the book made for a very weak storyline. Tidbits of information sprinkled throughout the book were interesting such as Lemonade Lucy, tarantulas not spinning webs, and tee-totaler Stonewall Jackson. If one can buy the ""impersonation"", book is entertaining otherwise."
4,Review of CSS Mastery book,This book is very designer-friendly. It is hard to find technical manuals that speak in plain enough English that less technical people can still find useful -- this book does just that.CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions
5,good book,"Received book almost immediately...enjoyed the contents. So far, this is one of the best books I've read on this subject. I wish i would have read this one first."
3,"Okay, but mostly available on the web","This is a decent book on advanced CSS, although there is more coverage given to CSS basics than I would have thought. Pretty much everything I read in this book I have read at an earlier time on one of the many excellent CSS sites on the web, including w3Schools, aListApart, 456 Berea Street, etc etc. While this book puts it all in one place, its easy to build a bookmark collection of good articles online that you can cut and paste from. This will likely be the last web technology book I will buy...online has surpassed the printed form in both quantity and quality. I do have some gripes with the specific content covered - much of it covers what I consider to be pointless chrome like dropshadows and rounded edges, and other gimmickry. Yet where is the discussion about modelling css for large organizations? I work in a firm where literally hundreds of people are using css everyday, and there are serious large-scale modelling issues.[...]"
3,CSS Mystery,"The book started out very good by clarifying a few things I missed in Elizabeth Castro's - XHTML & CSS. The author's explanation of the cascade & specificity was not very clear. He only gives you a basic introduction to positioning & fails to truly teach you how to use the CSS positioning properties in an effective manner. My top complaint though is the fact that the case study at http://tuscany.cssmastery.com breaks in IE7 (W T F ?) I would suggest reading Michael Bowers Pro CSS & HTML Design Patterns for a much more informative view of the cascade, specificity & positioning along with code that actually works in projects you may be trying to style up now! That being said - the book does have good sections on commenting your markup, application of filters & hacks & troubleshooting your designs."
5,A Great First CSS Book,"I'm a big fan of Eric Meyer's CSS books and used to recommend one of them to CSS neophytes. Now I'm recommending ""CSS Mastery.""The trick with CSS is getting the core concepts mentally cemented in place. ""CSS Mastery"" is well-written, well-organized and extremely clear. That makes it approachable and that means what you read will stick.""CSS Mastery"" is not a CSS reference manual. For that, turn to Meyer's ""Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide."" But make ""CSS Mastery"" your first purchase.This was my eighth CSS book. I wish it had been my first."
4,Excellent,"This is one of the best books on the subject I read so far. There is much stuff here however, and sometimes many concepts are concentrated in just a few lines. It will take time to test all this knowledge."
3,Not for Beginners,"This book has some useful information and is really targeted to the hardcore CSSers, who already know the basics (& a little bit more). It outlines clearly many topics and use some good examples (with some minor typos). If you are a beginner, I would not really recommend the book as it may overwhelm you with too technical stuff and exceptions. A good way in learning is not to provide exceptions at the beginning of a learning experience, but more towards the end. But that always happens with folks who know their stuff too well. So, get your basics and foundation right first, know about CSS and THEN go for this publication."
1,Not a good book,"I've gone thru half the book, and I'm very disapointed to say the least.I've done some html and css for abaout a year now, and I have'nt had any problems following a book in those subjects until now.The images that you need isnt there and when they are there the exercices doesnt work as you expect, inspite that I doublecheck 5 times so that I don't forget something in the code.. so boring.I'm convinced that most of the ""5-star"" reviews are sent in by the authors themselves. I dont recomend this book."
4,Great Book - if you are familiar with CSS,"This is a great book, but not suitable for novices. This was my first book about CSS, and I realized that you need to have a fundamental understanding of CSS before you dive into CSS Mastery. So, if you are a beginner get your basics somewhere else. If you are an intermediate CSS coder, this will teach you many new tricks.However, it is missing CSS references."
3,"Useful book, but sloppy editing","This is quite a useful book, as has been well documented in other reviews. The tips are helpful, the examples are useful, and the typography and layout are easy on the eyes.However -- and this is a big however -- the book is riddled with technical errors. The errata file, available for download from the publisher as a PDF file, currently runs a whopping 11 pages. While a small handful of errors in a technical book's first edition is inevitable, 11 pages is not a small handful for a book as thin as this. It's really inexcusable that so many errors -- some of them quite obvious -- made it past the editor."
4,CSS Takes Practice,"I found this book to be really helpful, mainly because of its clarity and simplicity. I've yet to do the 2 Case Studies included, but I intend to because reading this book has shown me that you can only master this information by doing it. Andy Budd, Simon Collison, et al, do a great job of giving you good examples to implement.While this book has not (nor any other source, so far) answered all of my questions in one fell swoop, it has given me a much clearer overall understanding of what I'm dealing with, allowing me to come up with better questions and strategies for solving problems that come up in making a web page work across popular browsers. I highly recommend it."
2,Dissapointed,"I used to get this magazine years ago and loved it. Now there are too many ads, The colored pictures used to be glossy, made you feel like you were there, now they are dull looking and cheap. Sorry to be so negative, but just not the same magazine. Sorry I bought a subscription!"
4,wireless door,"The change of tune should not be placed on the outside of the doorbell button. As a result, outside people or visitors could accidentally touch that small button and the tune will be changed. It should be placed inside the doorbell button. The chime should be placed as close to the doorbell button as possible. It did not work when I placed it twenty feet away, not to mention the fact that the manufacturer claims that it can be placed as far as 100 feet away! It is very clumsy to replace the battery on the doorbell button. If one places the chime as close to the doorbell button as possible, the sound of the chime is loud and clear. It would be even better if the size of the chime is smaller."
3,good but you have to like older recordings,"good album, has some great tracks. only complaint is the songs were recorded >20 yrs ago and the equipment was not great. So if you are an old diehard fan, you will like the album, but you ""youngins"" should buy a newer one. (like tony rice the bluegrass guitar album)"
2,For my 3yr old,Truck looks great but is not durable enough for smaller kids. My kid looks like a giant but he doesn't know how to be gentle. It lasted about 3 weeks before the wheels was the only thing left in tact.
4,"Good ol' Americana, a-pickin' and-a grinnin'",I've given this album 4 starts; In a nutshell - I highly recommend it to anybody with at least one non-tin ear. I have a longer review at my blog: http://warbler.posterous.com/album-review-merle-travis-24-greatest-hits.
3,Useful collection but not the best production of them,"The songs here are useful as a perspective on Merle Travis's contributions to bluegrass and country music (""Nine Pound Hammer"" may be one of the most heavily played songs in all of bluegrass). But the production leaves a bit to be desired. Merle's voice sounds tired and a bit flat, and the breaks are average, which had the effect of making the collection sound like Merle was covering his own songs. The initial recordings are better but a listener would have to find them all."
1,Medic Vol. 3,I was very disappointed to find that Vol. 3 did not mean third in the series and was just a repackaging of the same episodes on the first DVD entitled Medic Vol. 1. It would have been helpful to be able to access the episode information prior to purchase to avoid this type of problem.
1,Communicating With Animals,"This book is without value. I thought I was going to learn a better way of communicating with my animal companions. Instead I got nothing but New Age stories. If you believe in New Age philosophy, you might want to read this. If you're not a New Ager, don't waste your money. I rate this book at minus 2 stars."
3,Not for me,"Perhaps it is my own fault that I didn't read the book title carefully. The book was indeed on ""Studio"" photography. I was hoping to get some more general expert insights on lighting and posing. Instead, I was overwhelmed with suggestion about what kind of equipments to buy. The author assume that you are a professional photographer, who owns a studio, a medium format camera, and $10k+ for some lighting equipments. If you are such photographer, you might like this book. For me, I was lucky enough to own a 35mm SLR and a decent flash. This is not a bad book and the presentation is very personal, but this book is not for me. If you are like me, who just want to improve your chances of getting good pictures of your families and friends, try ISBN 1584280344 instead."
4,A very good first book,"This book answers questions you might have about the religion that finds so much mention and so little understanding today. If you are a serious student, you need to put aside most of what you have learnt about Islam from the media. Then begin with this book. [...]It is better to combine this book with a good translation of the Quran, like that of Yusuf Ali. However the book from Jeffrey Lang is useless. Save your money."
5,A succinct examination of what constitutes an intellectual.,"Said succinctly examines what constitutes an intellectual and what role he or she has in society. He represents the intellectual as someone who is an amateur, independent of special interests, and an activist willing to take on personal risk to speak the truth. But perhaps more important is the intellectual's reliance on reason and honesty as opposed to the constraints of dogma or ideology. This book is an important read for anyone whose work puts them in a position to affect policy or public opinion."
4,very nice,I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present and she was very pleased with it. The colors and the design is really nice.
1,Momisms: What she says and what she really means,I ordered a book and was sent some stick-on labels so I returned the wholeorder for credit.
3,Could be better ...,"Ok, the stick doesn't come in a box. It is shipped in a plastic bag along with a little felt bag that is less than half the length of the stick itself. The felt bag is kinda useless. Lastly it need more than a bit of polishing. Granted these are minor sounding things but it is a bday gift for a friend and I was hoping it would present better than it actually does. It also has a noticeable curve to the stick which may or may not be normal (I don't know about jewelry related things, but you have been warned)."
4,Good Life Vest,"We used this vest for my 12 month old son. We took him swimming in the pool for the first time while on vacation. It was a well constructed vest and easy to use. It definitely kept him afloat, but it seemed top heavy so often he would end up on his back (which was fine except for the blaring sun in his eyes). It did seem to bunch up around his head and neck, which made him upset at first, but that was no biggie to us. However, since he would cling to Dad and me, we ended up taking it off and just carrying him around the pool. It is worth the money and I am sure there are far more applications for it in the future."
2,Not sure about weight limit,The vest is actually smaller than another vest I have that is for <30lbs. I don't know how they can state that it is for <50lbs. I wish I would have known before buying.
3,Infant water vest,"I bought this water vest for my 15 month old grandchild to use when we would go out in our paddle boat on our small lake. We tried to use it 2 times but our grandson refused to wear it. It was very bulky and constraining. I though it was of very good quality and would do what it was made for, but what is the use if the child won't even wear it. If you have a more passive child it would be a good thing to have."
2,Not the best,I didn't think that this jacket fit AT ALL. My son screamed the second I put it on and I understand why he was upset. It basically choked him around the neck and didn't fit well at all. I ended up using one that some one had bought from Sam's Club and the Sam's club one fit perfectly well. No choking and he could move around and play. Would not recommend this one in the future.
4,Not sure on weight limit,"Life jacket is great and seems to fit okay, and we were only using it for emergencies anyway. So when we actually tried to float our 14 month old son in our pool, it seemed like he was floating REALLY low, and I don't know if it would keep him appropriately afloat for any long period of time."
4,Great for non-diabetics as well,"Let's face it. You want to go on a diet. You love sweets and you hate that most meal replacement bars taste like the pressed cardboard they're composed of. Today is your lucky day.I bought a pack of these to get some protein (which satisfies cravings) and satisfy my sweet tooth on the recommendation of a friend. They are rich and delicious.I am not going to lie. The texture is a bit weird at first, but the taste over rides this minor issue, making these well worth the money. At 210 calories (about the same as a chocolate bar) you can feel satisfied and stay on track too.Why cheat on your diet when you can have delicious chocolate and lose weight too?"
5,Glucerna meal bars,I use Glucerna bars everyday in my diabetic meal plan. It's helps me to control my calories and blood sugars... and they taste great !!!!
3,Need variety,I have used this product for a long time. It tastes good and serves it's purpose well but the manufacturer used to (maybe still does?) make other flavors that Amazon doesn't carry for some reason. I would really like a variety.
3,Over Packaged,Would have given these five stars except for all of the needless packaging.Would have given these five stars except for all of the needless packaging
3,"Good, I love Jennings, but this is not on par with his classics....","Jennings is one of the great writers of historical fiction. This was good, but not great. There were moments...."
1,Poorly conceived and constructed,"This house has no drainage and is cheaply constructed. It opens from the bottom, not the top, and the door doesn't use a screw or latch, instead it's a 'snug fit' closure - which means it's difficult to open without jostling the contents (even more so once the wood swells). There are better houses out there in the same price range (e.g., Garden Treasures)"
3,Blue Bird House,I saw nothing special about this item. I feel if it had a hinge that opened with a latch instead of a screw it would be much better. For the price you can find one at Walmart. My previous one I purchased locally and it is much better product.
1,4 bluebird houses,These bluebird houses are made out of cedar wood. The wood is only 5/16 thick. Out of the 4 boxes I ordered 2 of them had damage to the corner of the roof. One has a huge corner broken off and the other has a cracked corner. I have not decided to just repair them and use them or return them. You get what you pay for they were only $14.22 each.
1,Piece of crap,"This ""bluebird"" house is not built in any way to the specifications that real bluebird houses are supposed to be. Birds are picky, and want them a certain way. These are cheaply made, in China, might last one season. And, as I said, are NOT bluebird houses. I sent mine right back. Do not buy this, if you are looking for a real bluebird house, that will actually attract bluebirds."
3,Not up to specs,"This item is made of lovely and aromatic cedar as described. Unfortunately, it does not meet the specifications for standard bluebird houses. The floorboard doesn't have drainage, the inside front wall doesn't have scoring so the young can crawl out, and the ventilation is questionable.It is also cheaply made. The whole thing is constructed with air gun brads where small brass screws would have been sturdier. Also, the front panel is opened by removing a screw (see they have the screws) which will eventually strip out where a latch would last longer."
5,"A fanciful, fast-paced delight","Amis' writing turns the most wretched characters into sympathetic and comic protagonists. This book is no exception. At its most superficial level, the plot is that of a very silly horror story. The elements of absurdity keep the pace quick, preventing us from consciously dwelling on the book's philosophical undertones. The result is a delightful cross between literary perfection and an episode of Scooby Doo.This book would have made a perfect addition to a time capsule: on a number of levels, it brilliantly reflects the time in which it was written (the late 60's)."
3,Not impress,This DVD is really basic boxing drill but well done. I think the coach may be more enthusiasm and give more tips.
1,the dvd appears to be a bootleg,This dvd appears to be a copy of an old VHS and is poor quality. The mini series is excellent once you get use to the quality. I was expecting a store bought dvd not a bootleg copy.
4,Fatal Vision,My mother had read the book Fatal vision and she was so excited when I bought her the movie. The came in good condition and It was an excellent movie.
4,"I didn't do it, and you can't prove it anyway!","The movie is well done, and depicts the events as outlined in the McGinnis book. Even more fascinating is the fact that McGinnis later admitted that he made up much of his story (something about the story being more important that the truth), and that prosecutors not only withheld information, but actually falsefied evidence. Yet ask most people about the MacDonald case and they will site the movie (perhaps the book) as their source. Wow!"
1,This movie gives a false view of Dr. MacDonald and the case.,This movie is based on the fiction book by the famous liar Joe McGinness. I would advise people not to buy this movie. The true story of the MacDonald case can be found in the book Fatal Justice. There will also be another movie on the case coming soon. This time it will tell the WHOLE truth about the MacDonald case. END
4,Excellent TV Movie!,"The first point that needs to be made is WHERES THE DVD!!! This is another example of a fine movie being dismissed for who knows what reason. I'm sick of it. That being said, this is by far some of the finest acting by Karl Malden and Gary Cole. This is the story of army officer McDonald plight after being accused of killing his family in the late sixties. The look and feel of the era is captured perfectly along with the weird complexityof McDonald. Plays great from beginning to end. Did he or didn't he? Thought provoking and all around mysterious. Properly needs to be put on dvd, big time!"
2,Unhappy organizer.,"This desk organizer was not easy to put together. The dowels came through the other inside and could not be pushed back in, so one of my vertical pieces does not fit well at all. Also, the dividers on the bottom are made of cardboard! What gives! Cardboard - you have got to be kidding. Couldn't you supply a very thin piece of the material that te rest was made of. When I put something on this shelf and it pulls out, everything fall off. UGH! Try another desk organizer."
4,Pretty Good. Room for improvement.,"Overall, pretty good. The horizontal divider shelves on bottom are of heavy cardboard and unfinished. That could look better. Otherwise, I like the space it provides."
5,great read,was recommended by a person in my ministerial classes. I haven't finished as yet but it is a great add to my library of metaphysical books
5,Sweet Inspiration!,"This book is a darling, inspirational book on nursery decorating. It is based on designs with the baby quilt as the central focal point. There are lots of tips on room color and ideas on furniture to use, etc. I think the ideas may be challenging to create for people who don't sew or paint (aren't crafters), but the book is lovely and has a wonderful inspirational value which anyone decorating a nursery should enjoy. Jennifer Sampou designs fabric for Koffman, so look for her 100% cotton fabrics in quilting fabric stores! They are also lovely!"
4,Great!,"I love Slayers! It's one of my favorite Anime (Other than the Shojo : Bishou Senshi Sailor Moon) , but why? *choke* did they *Sob* put in cus words? ;_; I watched this in front of my mom, and she had her doughts. The cus words make it unnatural. I love the beginning and ending songs! I really want to get the CD! Next time, software sculptors, pleeeeeeze don't put in cus words!!! Anyway, Zelgadis is so cute (Except for the rocks), and Gourry so sweet. Lina really isn't that flat chested *_*. I'm really mad about Gourry calls her a little girl all the time @_@ But Gourry is really nice, and Lina takes that for granted! I think it's a cute Anime! Maybe software Sculptors can work on it a little to get it back in shape."
5,A wonderful series of Japanamation,"I absolutely love the Slayers! It's well drawn, the voices are great, and it is so funny! I have all of the volumes and watch them repeatedly. This is a great series! END"
3,SUB SUB SUB FOR GOD'S SAKE GET THE SUBBED VERSION!!,"Now ordinarily,reviewing the slayers would mean an instant 5 stars,but this is dubbed and the voices are terrible.For God's sake people hell for my sake even if your gonna watch this series watch them subtitled."
5,Strangely Appealing,"The combination of interesting grim facts (including some quotes from tobacco executives, and some of the author's own smoking experiences) and lots of whacky cartoons, many of which had me bursting out laughing, adds up to an overall appealing book. I keep going back to marvel at my favorite cartoons."
4,Worked well...eventually,"Took some trial and error to find the correct piece and amount of force to use on my particular (round) locking nuts. The kit includes *zero* instructions (Amazon, the product detail should be amended!). I watched a few YouTube videos on general locking lug nut removal and got an idea of what needed to happen. The first lug took the longest, after I got the hang of it, the pieces in the kit worked well.I didn't use pneumatic tools. I used a 1/2"" socket, extension and a breaker bar."
2,Product did not work for me.,"This kit did not work for me. I purchased this kit when I lost my key to the locking lugs on my 20 year old f-250.The kit arrives with very little instruction. The chrome lug nut appeared to damage the threads of the socket that fit my lug nut. After this failed, I purchased the Gator Grip ETC-125MO King Gator Socket. This socket easily took my lug nuts off."
3,Super sound and Sound value,"The earbud headset works great and with superior sound quality. The microphone works very well and amazingly has little, if any, background noise. The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star recomendation is the lack of a mute switch. The Trickle charger works fine as well."
3,Definately a downgrade from her last album,"I bought this CD thinking it was going to be as great as her last album. I was disappointed. Many of her songs are bad translations of her spanish songs from her last album. A few of her new songs sound more J.Lo (it seems those songs even have that same exagerated computer-enhanced-voice style that J.Lo has in her songs). Don't Say Good Bye and Border Girl, however, are good songs. Particularly, I liked the new spanish songs. Overall 3 stars out of 5."
2,Not too impressed with the Border Girl :-(,"I have been a fan of Paulina Rubio since her debut album, 1992's ""La Chica Dorada"" - I was expecting a great album in English and just like Shakira, Paulina loses all essence of herself in the crossover.What ... is so hot about Latin singers singing in English? I just don't get it! If they spoke good English, my opinion would be totally different. I am Latin and when I want to hear Paulina Rubio - SORRY FOLKS I PREFER HER IN SPANISH NOT IN HER RICKY RICARDO ENGLISH!I pray that Thalia (my other favorite latin singer) doesn't do this dumb crossover thing, IF IT ISN'T BROKEN WHY FIX IT PEOPLE!""I an de Bordeer'gil crossin the border in tha name of loove""..."
2,Border Girl.....hmmmmmm.....,"What happened to the quality that she reflected in her last album, the mega-hit ""Paulina"". Being up to date with all Mexican artists Paulina has never been the artist that you would expect the best from so when she released ""Paulina"" everyone knew that that would be her best work for a few years, everyone was right. I admire her for wanting to do her crossover but honestly 2 good songs in english are not enough. If you have the chance purchase the singles for ""Don't say goodbye"" and ""Fire"", nothing else is worth listening, oh, yeah, in spanish ""Si tu te vas"" and ""Todo mi amor"". The cover is not very inviting, neither is the music, This is a CD that you would borrow from a friend rather than waste your money yourself."
4,Let's play with fire,"It seem every latin popstars dream is the big american crossover, and nobody does it better than Paulina. I've been a Paulina fan for a long time, stuck with her through the good times and the bad. Let's start with the BAD times on her current album:1.NOT THAT KIND OF GIRL-just because this song was a hit in spanish doesn't mean it should be translated akwardly to english, and speaking of akward....2.THE LAST GOODBYE-The spanish version was awesome, this version doesnt fit.3-STEREO- This song is terrible and the lyrics are lame.Now moving on to the GOOD songs:1-FIRE- Very sexy,has a better beat than the spanish version2-THE ONE YOU LOVE-A great pop-rock song,easy to sing along to...3-I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU-A great remake of the classic KISS song...Overall a very good album with some redundancies.Hopefully Paulina will leave out the remakes of her old hits in her next album and bring in more new songs."
4,"A great album, by a great woman","Paulina Rubio certainly has a lot of talent, and it shows. With her newest and first English album she proves that she has the power to make it world wide. Her album ha a great variety of styles on it, going from rock to pop, Latin to dance. The songs are all catchy and true sing-a-longs. There's just one thing that dissapointed me, the song ""The one you love"". Don't get me wrong it's one of the most awesome songs I've ever heard, but she's not the first one to sing it. It's is also on the album of a Dutch band called K-otic and their album has been released for over a year. I do like how it's a little different, it's not exactly the same. This album is a true must-have for pop/r&b/latin lovers, though!"
1,CAN U SAY HORRIBLE,"THERE IS NO OTHER WORD TO DESCRIBE THIS ... THING (and that's) HORRIBLE : THERE IS NO SONG WORTHY OF REPEATING ! DON'T SAY GOODBYE IS EVEN WORSE LONGER, AND ALL HER OLD SPANISH SONGS SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN SPANISH ! SEXUAL LOVER S HORRIBLE ! WITH ITS HORRIBLE VOCALS AND BAD BAD TRANSLATION ITS NOT EVEN WORTH HEARING ! CASANOVA IS LIKE THE ONLY GOOD SONG ! THE ONLY REASON I LIKE IT IS FOR ITS CHORUS ! ..."
4,Muy buena por Paulina!,"First off, Paulina is not, by any means, the world's greatest vocalist. Like J.Lo, she is somewhat thin voiced but still loaded with musicality. One can tell that she's not totally comfortable singing in English yet, as the lyrics sound a bit forced. The Spanish tracks, however, flow much better. Despite these flaws, this disc is still fun, full of energy, and dance floor ready. Paulina does not write any of her own music on this album, which doesn't help her. Writing her own music could help her find her own voice and sense of style. 'Border Girl' and 'Don't Say Goodbye' are my fave tracks. They're easy and fun to listen to say the least! Some critics are picking on Paulina because the lyrics are light weight and, what they call, 'Fluffy.' I say, 'Who cares!' If every singer was like Alanis Morissette and Melissa Etheridge, with their deeply personal and meaningful lyrics, the world would simply go nuts! Paulina's music is light, fun and relaxing. ENJOY!"
3,SoSo English re-mixes of Great songs,"My partner is from Monterrey, Mexico and I have been listening to her Spanish versions of most of the songs on this album for at least a year of two. My sugestion is if you like the single ""Don't Say Goodbye,"" buy the single re-mix. Otherwise buy her Spanish versions. One correction, I did like the song Stereo, and I don't think that is available in Spanish."
1,PAU...HORRIBLE!! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!?!,"I must say that this album REALLY, REALLY let me down! Paulina's last album PAULINA was awesome! And now that she has choosen to ""crossover"" she could have done WAY better than this album!! First off, her english is horrible. No real music fan in the U.S. is going to be amazed by Paulina in the way SHAKIRA has amazed us. Second, there are TOO MANY songs from her previous album PAULINA that she chose to merely translate into english!! DOES NOT WORK HERE!! They were perfect in spanish and should never had been touched. Such a waste of money!! Anybody want my copy?"
2,the weak accent... just a translation from PAULINA reecord..,"This is unbelievable! The weak accent, lyrics with no sense, just a translation from PAULINA record one, with some inedits singles and the unique ""Don't say goodbye"". Worst than the others latin to sing, the poor accent, she just can't sing in english, it's just so poor. Even Shakira, with her silly voice is better, and of course Thalia or Laura Pausini who made a real effort to demonstrate how to sing in english. This record has a good one: ""Libre"", wich is the best song in spanish... and in english: ""Undeniable"". The rest are just lyrics with no sense, with the accent from a beginer of english language. Don't waste your time buying this record... go to the last one: PAULINA, or for best english latin performers like: LAUNDRY SERVICE (SHAKIRA), FROM THE INSIDE (LAURA PAUSINI) or ""THALIA 2003"" (THALIA). In France this record was unknown!"
4,'Border Girl' ? More Like 'Dance Diva',"The latest in the seemingly endless line of Latino performers to attempt the almight ""crossover"", Paulina Rubio's debut may surprise some looking for Latin-tinged pop. It's here, to be sure, but this Mexican bombshell also traffics in savvy dance-club beats, typified by the entrancing first single 'Don't Say Goodbye', as well as 'Fire' and the wonderfully catchy 'I'll Be Right Here(Sexual Lover)'. She also appears equally at ease with straight-ahead pop, evidenced in such tracks as 'Not That Kind Of Girl'and the title cut. Vocally,her grasp of English gets in the way on more than one occasion, and her voice lies somewhere in the middle between JLO(far better) and Shakira(not quite there). Overall, though it's not as ambitious as Shakira's LAUNDRY SERVICE, the close proximity of musical styles found here makes it the more consistent album of the two."
2,Big Disappointment,"Paulina Rubios Border Girl proved to me that I should not buy an album after loving only one song. When Don't Say Goodbye came out, I instantly fell in love with it. I figured, the whole album has got to be incredible. I was wrong. The rest of the album is so boring, so overproduced I immediately regretted buying it and wished I bought the CD single. Paulina does have a unique voice and she has excellent presence in her videos, but I wish she had chosen better material. It's like her producers wanted her to be the next Britney Spears so they thew together a bunch of bad pop songs to get her noticed in the US. What she should have done is gone the Shakira route or even the Christina Aguilera route and gotten some good writers and producers and put together an outstanding album that would have proven to the world Paulina Rubio has arrived. Unfortunately, Border Girl will be forgotten and we may never hear from her again."
1,It's ok,This album is not so good when comparing it to her previous cd in spanish. It seems as a rushed effort into getting something out to the English market to capitalize on her spanish album success. A few of the song are catchy though.
5,this album is awesome!!!!,"Oh My God!, this is definetely the best album I own.it has great songs like ""sexual lover"", ""fire"", ""the one you love"", ""casanova""(my favorite song), ""border girl"" (a great slow track).well, all of the songs here are amazing.just buy the album and you will realize...paulina is the GOLDEN GIRL of pop!!!!"
3,"Not that bad, but it wont work.","Another one of those latin artists that gonna make it in english i guess, however this is far from as unique as Shakira or as catchy as Enrique. It's pretty commercial neo-disco music with latin sound, decent pop perhaps with a few good songs, but haven't we heard it all before so many times? Perhaps some countries in Europe that are still into dance-pop will buy some copies but in the us, i doubt it. Catchy pop songs like "" The one you love"" ""I'll be right here""(best song of the album) and ""border girl"" and ballads like ""undeniable"" plus a few songs in her native language spanish. I think ""stereo"" got a pretty cool americanized soulish sound but the song itself is rather weak. ""I was made for loving you"" a cover of the classic Kiss song but with disco sound. The CD is allright with a few good songs, but nothing that really surprises me."
1,"Poor Girl, Bored Girl!","""Border Girl"" is Paulina Rubio's first English album. Wait a moment, was it English or Chinese? I could not tell if it was English. Her accent is horribly bad and Chinese-like. The music was boring and the vocals where imposible to understand. If you hear one of her songs and hear the word ""weed"" it's not ""weed"" but ""with"", but her accent is so bad that you can't even understand it. The only good song, in my opinion, was ""Si Tu Te Vas""."
1,HORRIBLE VOICE!!!!!,"I'm sorry, but Paulina needs to learn how to pronounciate english words corretly. I was listeing to her songs and I was not able to understand a word. The worst thing is that they dont include the lyrics, which make it all that worse. Now, whats up with her just translating all her old songs into english and calling it ""Border Girl""? Adding 2-3 songs, to old material does not make for a hot selling album."
1,"Shallow, Meaningless, Overproduced garbage","When will this end? When will this era of shallow music end? I mean where are the musicians who play instruments and write meaninngful songs with emotion? Gee how did i know this album was gonna be all about love? This is fake, along with all the Britney's and Boybands. Do yourself a favor and get music from Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye, Or The Beatles and Nirvana. Those artists sang about life. Not just ""Oh, I love you"" crap."
5,A Border Girl Who Truly Transcends Borders,"Paulina Rubio is Latin Music's answer to a request for a fresh innovative new style to Latin Rock 'n Roll. Hip and sassy, Paulina Rubio puts at rest an era of association of Latin Music with the more ""oompa"" style of its predecessors and marches right to the top of the charts with a very contemporary and spunky rock 'n roll enjoyed on an international level.Sure to be enjoyed by Spanish speakers as well as those that don't, Paulina Rubio's Border Girl is a must-have for any party to be successful and shared with anyone who has yet to appreciate the contemporary new Latin Music style and Rock in Spanish genre.Border Girl"
3,Three stars plus......,"Paulina Rubio is one my favorites singers out there, I was a bigger fan in the early Paulina days back in 1990/96. Her first two albums are the best 1. (La chica dorada) 2.(24 kilates)also her peak with me was her 3rd CD ( planeta Paulina) I really recomend for new fans to pick those up aswell. This Border girl cd isnt to bad, I wont say terrible cuase shes the MEXICAN MADONNA.(well YURI is also) But her english sound is bad, theres not feeling in her songs(voice) her voice in spanish is awsome it has a rasp witch is very sexy. I think Pau. needs to stay recording in spanish, However Border Girl managed to debut on the top 20 at #11 certified gold selling over 500.000 copies in the US, not bad for PAU'S 1st english album. But she should stay recording in spanish. GO PAU!!!!!!"
3,Good for what it is...,"I have been a Paulina Rubio fan since forever. Her new album Border Girl is nice album, to introduce the english speaking world to Paulina's world. But sadly this album really is just disposable pop that people might not remember after a few years. Border girl has some of her Hits from Paulina in english and one song both in english and spanish. The translation from spanish to english isn't always smooth, but thats something that is easy to look over. This album is fun and engeretic, but alas this album is the lesser of all her albums. Give it a shot, you may like it. She is no Britney Spears. She is better than J Lo, Thalia, Ricky Martin and even Enrique, but not Fey."
3,Kind of boring!,I love the author but found this book to drag considerably. I finished it but do not feel impelled to finish the series.
4,My grand baby LOVE the cow,"My grand daughter really fell in love with this cow. It's well made, not much in the way of educational, but she loves to cuddle it. It is nice and soft."
2,It was SO close to being a good game,"I bought this game expecting to be amazed at how cool the graphics looked.... I was impressed!.... At the graphics. The gameplay, on the other hand, sucks. Driver on gbc was way more entertaining than this garbage.The good;*Graphics are way ahead of gameboy standers.The Bad;*The cops sit there and smile at you while you run over the civilions of miami.*You drive like you're drunk.*You can't shoot from your car or even at certain angles.The Ugly;*This game had potential to be a great game, but it was garbage because they didn't make it as smooth as it should of been.Don't buy this game. I find it so funny how people who don't even own the game come on here and say that it's such a great game. I bought this game along with Metal Slug Advanced and Wolfenstein 3-D. I can promise you that I will not be playing ""DRIV3R"" any time soon. Not to mention, I'm gonna buy Doom 1 & 2 soon, so this game is gonna be gathering dust for the next 10 years on my shelf. Don't buy it."
3,Driver3...one of the very last games made for GBA,"Driver 1 and 2 are extremely fun games for the GameBoy. As for 3....it's ok. I with they left in a few tid bits as found on 1 and 2...like going for a ride.Good game tho, but I'd rather have Driver 1 or 2 if I couild buy just one of the 3"
1,A very poorly made game,"This game is so bad that I had to put my two cents on it. The controls are so bad that I found myself ready to throw my Game Boy Advance down. It was frustrating. Couple that with the trial-and-error design of this game and I was left a frustrated man. The other review I notice is supposedly from a child. Isn't this game rated ""M""? This game also has the worst computer controlled A.I. You can drive right past the police cars. I have played other games that this game seems to be trying to compete with like Grand Theft Auto and this game is a laugher compared to those."
1,It is Gaffer Tape but it probbably an't Permacell,I am a professional photographer with over 10 years experience so I have seen a lot of Gaffer tape. The Rolls of tape that I received have small blank unlabeled cores. They are also thinner stiffer and less sticky than other rolls of actual permacell gaffer tape that I have in the studio.
2,not quite as advertised,Just a little disappointing to see that the cardboard core is only about a half inch in diameter. I like to throw my tape on a porta brace belt pack and can't do it do to the size of the core.
3,Ricks Kid,I will always give Rick Wakeman a 5 rating because of his excellence and innovative style.. This is his son...I give him a 3 rating. That should tell you something.
1,Culture Shock Denmark,I read Culture Shock Denmark! I thought this book was boring but I think this book would be good for people that want to travel to Denmark. It talks about how to live in Denmark and how to communicate. it talks how good the jobs and how to get into them.The reason why I thought this book was boring was because I wasn't getting into the book. I would rather read a story book about denamrk. This book only had facts about it but if you really want to know how people are in denmark this would be a good book. This book would also be a really good book it you are doing research on Denmark.
2,Terrible!,"This book was a terrible introduction to Denmark and the Danes, primarily because it was soooo negative! When I arrived in Denmark I found the Danes to be nothing like the ogres described in this book. I did, however, give the book two stars because there are some good things in there about the government and history. Choose another book as your introduction to Denmark!"
5,Invaluable for foreigners living in Denmark!,"I strongly recommend this book for all foreigners living and working in Denmark (or those who plan to.) It covers all of the necessary details, the sort of daily information not covered in ordinary travel books (settling in, work life, family life, communication, socializing, etc.)The book was written by a Dane who lived and worked abroad for 20 years before returning home to Jutland. He has the unique perspective of being a native and a foriegner at the same time. I find his insight to be invaluable and only wish that I could have found this book earlier in our stay here."
1,YUCK!,"Uninspiring, saccharine and totally Hollywood, I read it to the end in the hope that maybe I was just missing something good. Nada."
1,Do not waste your time or money!,"I am a Library Supervisor. I picked this book for my library because of the deceiving reviews and enticing title. I was very disappointed in my selection. The writing is poor. The author notes in her introduction, ""To protect the privacy of my children and ex-husbands, I created fictional characters to stand in their stead and speak and act in ways they hadn't. What has resulted is a book that defies categories- a hybrid- and if that sounds like an elaborate dodge, what I can say is that I'm telling you this story in the best and perhaps the only way I can."" Yes, this book defies categories! It is one book I wish I never started! The author is arrogant and selfrighteous She must have also been protecting the privacy of her cat, since she changed it's name in the middle of the book! Do not waste your time or money on this book!"
3,Why does it have to seem superficial?,"(...) I was very interested in the premise, which has a great deal of romantic potential, and I can understand the attraction between these two, very different people. What bothered me here was the superficiality of Sara, shown in her own words, after all. Is she aware of how her job, her kids, and her own life look mean spirited and flimsy? I am puzzled by the choices that she makes, and also puzzled by Zack's willingness to put up with her world, which very clearly wants nothing to do with him."
2,"Unchallenging, superficial","I picked this up at the library and can't wait to exchange it for something else. The premise sounded so appealing; I was eager to read something meaningful that explored Romance at Middle Age, Improbable Matches, Overcoming Obstacles . . . what I got instead was a sense that Sara, like locker room boys, has to affirm her desirability and sexuality by sharing the graphic details with the world. I'm no prude, but as she once told her son, ""That's private."" And why does it seem that she is the only one who does any self-examination, hard thinking, adaptation? I so longed for her to tell Zack what HE had to be to ""run with her."" He challenges her, but there's not much mention of how SHE challenges HIM. The relationship may be unorthodox, but the only ""meat"" to it seems to exist in the bedroom. (Pun intended.)"
1,She's too much of a whiner for me.,"Haaving read some writeups about this book, I looked forward to a quick, easy read with an interesting tale. But the author turned out to be such a whiner, I was seriously disappinted. She was too concerned with how her lover looked and acted, what her friends would think, and whether she could continue having the material blessings she'd enjoyed. She didn't seem willing to take him as he was, but wanted to make him into her ideal of a cowboy-toy. He, on the other hand, impressed me as a much more patient, mature character, willing to take things as they are, not as he wanted them to be. Life is too short and I'm sorry I wasted my time and money. Furthermore ... where was her editor? There were so many grammatical errors throughout the narrative that I got the impression that the editor must have been vacationing on Mars."
2,It's no Loose Change but compelling in its way.,"Loose Change is a never-to-be-forgotten book about the 60's and this is an easily-forgotten guilty pleasure, but a pleasure while reading it. Flimsy but stylish, the bottom line for me was the same as another review - her children must have been mortified. I wish I hadn't been so intrigued when I saw Davidson on a CSPAN panel of writers. Ran right out and bought it. But ... it was pretty entertaining. Very good beach read."
1,slow - boring,"Mary Chapin Carpenter does not sing ""Independence Day"" - Martina McBride does. She got a bum - not a real cowboy. Being born and raised in the West, this is not your typical cowboy, he's a bum. Makes all the hard working, independent, financially responsible real cowboys look bad."
1,"Sorry, bored me to death","I was totally intrigued by the basic story, that's why I bought the book. Since I share many of Ms. Davidson's outer circumstances I expected to be carried away with her love story. Unfortunately she bored the hell out of me, not only with bad writing, but also her condescending attitude towards everybody ""beneath"" her. As an actor I feel insulted, I've been an extra many times, and no, we don't go on talking about a handshake for months. I expect a lot more wisdom from anybody claiming to be so spiritual."
2,ridiculous and phony,"I worked as a cowboy for six years, and Davidson's ""cowboy"" seems like nothing of the sort, to me. A) I don't think real, working cowboys are all that romantic, as they are usually tired and often somewhat chauvinistic. B) Her fawning over his ""rough"" character makes me want to vomit. Please, Sara, spare us your mid-life crisis."
4,Sexy & Fun - for middle aged women!,I didn't know what this book really was about when I picked - but it was the perfect vacation reading for a 40 something woman.
5,Excellent and well documented reading!!!,"This is the most interesting and well documented work I have read about the missing link between Reincarnation and Christianity. Besides being informative and entertaining, it also opens your eyes to the history of the manipulation by the Catholic Church, and other Christian denominations, of the true teachings of Christ about life, death and the beyond."
2,"""Probably""","I agree with much of the other feedback from ""Dallske"" and there is ALOT of info missing in explaining any true facts. My biggest bug is that she constantly uses the word ""Probably."" To me, that makes it All speculation!"
5,Reincarnation - The missing link in Christianity,Excellent book. Should have been titled Christianity and Reincarnation...has some very enlightening information about Christianity.
1,I Have Some Property East of Atlantic City to Sell You Too,"If you can't figure out where she is off on her information, you're just plain determined to believe this crock is true.If you want to believe this that badly, well, then I have some property just east of Atlantic City to sell you, too. ;)"
2,Bluebeard,"Yes, I only gave this two stars. However, to give this film it's due, it was beautifully costumed, scripted, and acted. BUT, and there is a big BUT, there is an unsettling ending to this film, that I'll not reveal, however, in fairness to this film, being based on the fairy tale Bluebeard...perhaps I should have expected it."
4,Beware the review called 'Boring'...It contains MAJOR SPOILERS,"This movie is beautiful and atmospheric but doesn't move as quickly as many may expect, in part due to it being based on a short fairy tale (which the filmmakers were careful not to ruin by including too much that may have compromised the arc of the original story) as well as the director's style which is perfectly suited to this pace. That being said, if you enjoy gothic, elegant and deliberately slow paced movies you will probably like Bluebeard. I would like to have seen more melodrama at certain points which would have lent a lively kicker to a few spots but I found no significant weak elements worth mentioning. The best way to view this movie is to NOT read the short story first so that you will discover it as the movie plays out and will enjoy the suspense even more. Overall a fine movie for those who have the patience to see it through."
2,"Sirius subscription is good, Radios are awful",Within the first year of my Sirius subscription I am having problems with my 3rd Sportster 3.1st radio - power supply cord for car malfunctioned after 3 weeks2nd radio - Antenna began malfunctioning after 1st month3rd radio - This one was ok for first 6 months however none of the buttons on the unit itself work now except for the knob which can only be turned. Without the remote the radio is useless.I am happy with the subscription however I would definately buy any other brand of radio. Sirius dock and play radios are terrible.
1,Get another model,"I've literally gone through three Sportster3 and its a lousy peace of equipment. I used the home kit and it works fine for a few weeks then the receiver won't power on. Add to this the long procedure of calling Sirius warranty apart from the agony of them shipping wrong items or missing accessories. After regularily spending that much time, effort and money it gets to the point when you tell yourself ""to hell with satellite radio""."
1,More to be desired,"The book arrived before I expected it. It was intact and appeared clean. A cursory examination revealed no torn or ""dog eared"" pages (though I must admit to being more interested in the content of the pages than the appearance of the pages).I had read only a few pages when the back ""slid"" off and the book began falling apart page by page. The glue apparently is dry and ineffective. The book will continue to fall apart page by page until book repairs are made or until I take it to be repaired. It is not usable or readable as is and attempting to puruse page content is unenjoyable at best. I have never experienced a paperback falling apart in this manner. One or two of my old, old paperbacks (some are 35-40 years old) have come apart at sections of the book but never page-by-page as this book has come apart. Whether this is attributable to the seller is the judgment of the reader of this review..."
1,Don't waste your money,this is a typical book comes out of George Reese:1. poorly written2. shamelessly copy and paste existing materials from reference manual3. full of errorthe author is only trying to get a quick buck or two.avoid it at all cost.
2,Lack of In-Depth Information,"I generally love the O'Reilly books because they tend to be very thorough and have lots of practical code examples, but this book was a big disappointment to me. I was easily frustrated by this book. As a beginner to MySQL and database programming, I was completely lost whenever I tried to apply something to my own projects. The explanations given here are very brief and the authors often send you elsewhere for more in-depth discussion. I wound up doing most of my research online and just using the SQL reference chapter to look-up query syntax. I give it two stars because it did help me get started, but I'd say this is a poor reference for anyone looking for in-depth coverage."
1,It is NOT for managing MySQL,"The book title is completely mis-leading. It has little info on administrate the server - little practical details. I regret I bought it, because I was looking for info to ""manage"" MySQL."
2,Better than the 1st edition,"This book is a significant improvement over the 1st edition (which was titled MySQL & mSQL), mainly because it focuses directly on MySQL instead of focusing on the differences between MySQL and mSQL. This book leaves out critical information, which is why I gave it only 2 stars. The word REPLICATION isn't even in the book's Index (I skimmed the book and didn't see it covered anywhere in the text either), and MySQL's Replication Functionality is one of its most valuable features for fault tolerance! Also, the book is ambiguous on other Fault Tolerance issues. For example, on page 74 the book says to ""store the binary logs on the same device as the backups"". Binary logs are generated real-time as incremental updates between the nightly dumps - the book makes no effort to explain how to replicate those logs real-time to a separate server. If you're going to buy only one book on MySQL, I'd suggest Atkinson's book: core MySQL."
3,Much too long,"I have been r eading it for several weeks, which is unusual as I usually finish a book in less than a week, more often in two or three days. It is too full of unnecessary detail, especiallly the x-rated parts which I found offensive and not important to the story line."
2,not my speed,"If I were still in college, and trying to impress myself/ others with my giant intellect, I might have finished this book. But now that I am reading strictly for myself, I have better things to read than to try to slog my way through this."
2,Brothers by Chayym Zeldis,The subject appeared to have been interesting it was extremely long and a struggle to get through. If you want to take the time to get through it be prepared.
3,Loved it/hated it,"Excellent plot and timing, loved seeing Lynley and Havers back to it (four stars), but what a bloody cheap twist at the end (one star). I don't know if I'll read the next one or not."
3,Something different,"I'm glad I didn't read comments about this novel before reading it. Some of the comments would have definitely spoiled my enjoyment of the story. The unexpected plot twists added to the developement of the recurring characters in the series. Their actions make them human and fallible which is one of the reasons that I love the books. It is true that some minor characters could have been totally eliminated without much consequence to the major plot, but some of them did serve their purpose in creating a background of suspense. I would have liked more of an explanation of the motivation of the killer as well as some subtle clues that might have helped me solve the mystery. It's not the best book in the series but it is certainly an important one in terms of character development in the overall series. I can't wait to see what happens to the characters that I've grown to love. The books' strength far exceeds its flaws."
1,I could not believe this was Elizabeth George,This book was overly long and rambling. The characters did not seem the same people as previous books. It is hard to believe Elizabeth George wrote this book as the style is so different from previous books. I skipped over pages and finally read the ending as I could not read the whole book.
3,Not the Best Linley yarn,"This one labor's and struggled to keep my interest, unlike all of George's other Linley novels which are of the ""cannot put down"" variety.Despite the presence of all the main characters there is a bit of lack of binding between the main caste.As for Helen's fate? bad move IMHO"
3,Brilliant!,"I thought this book was one of Elizabeth George's best. Although the book is long it kept me guessing from beginning to end. I must say I was very surprised and extremely saddened by the demise of one of the central characters. However, I am sure that in her next novel Ms. George has something wonderfully intriguing in mind for the always engaging Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers. I can hardly wait!"
1,Will it ever end?,"I am only about 100 pages into this book, and already wondering if it will ever end. It is boring. Beyond boring. I read the last chapter hoping that it will spice up, but it seems tragic and senseless rather than interesting. I'm giving up on Ms. George before we get going, I'm afraid."
1,"Fallen off my ""favorite author"" list","Elizabeth George turns in another over complicated mystery. The plot is by turns boring and over-wrought, the villan is unconvincing, and she kills off a main character in a way that has nothing to do with the rest of the plot and is utterly implausible. With No One as Witness is a deeply unsatisfying book that reeks of the author's fatigue or boredom. Not worth the money -- not even in paperback. If you must read it, get it from the library."
3,Good but not great,This book is very long and it took me a while to get into it. It was a bit slow going at first. I loved other books by Elizabeth George but this was not one of her best and the ending was terribly sad.
4,An Emotional Journey for Lynley,"WITH NO ONE AS WITNESS is really like two books in one, a crime story and Detective Inspector Lynley's personal story. The crime story, which involved the serial killing of ""at-risk"" adolescent boys, was not really a compelling narrative. I usually love Elizabeth George books, but it dragged in many parts and the first half of the book seemed like a bit of a chore to read. What really saved this book was Thomas Lynley's personal story. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say it involved quite a shock. The second half of the book picked up tremendously. Series readers will get the full emotional effect of the events. Elizabeth George is an excellent author, and I hope next time the crime around which the crime revolves will the more engaging.First half of book: 3 starsSecond half of book: 5 stars"
3,Hearthbreaking!,"Undoubtedly Elizabeth George is a clever and enjoyable writer. I have read all ofher books the instant that I could get my hands on them---even in hardcover. However, a friend gave the shocker away to me about this one, and I have given the book away unread. The world is a very sad place, and I don't need to make myself unhappier by experiencing (if only by reading) the loss of something so wonderful in this series. I'm tired of the darkness..."
1,GEORGE FAN,"I HAVE BEEN AN ELIZABETH GEORGE FAN FOR YEARS,AND HAVE FOLLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL HER UNIQUE CHARACTERS. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR BARBARA HAVERS TO FALL IN LOVE FOR SO LONG, AND WAS HOPING IT WOULD HAPPEN IN THIS BOOK, HOWEVER, I WILL NEVER KNOW, AS I THREW THIS BOOK AWAY AFTER READING ABOUT THE THIRD CHILD MURDERED. THIS WORLD IS FULL OF REPORTS OF CHILD MOLESTERS/MURDERS AND I DIDN'T FEEL I NEEDED TO SPEND MY ""DOWN TIME"" ENJOYING A BOOK THAT WAS COMPLETELY DISTURBING. ANY OTHER TOPIC WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN OK, BUT LEAVE OUT THE MURDERS OF INNOCENT CHILDREN- IT IS HEARTBREAKING AND TOO MUCH TO TAKE IN. I AM ADDITIONALLY DISSAPOINTED TO READ THAT HELEN IS KILLED IN THIS BOOK. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."
1,Utterly disappointing,"In this novel, Elizabeth George shatters the quintet of main characters that has given strength and interest to her long running detective series. By killing off Helen Clyde (surely this is no longer a spoiler) she seems decided to make either the perpetually aggrieved Barbara Havers or the dreary Simon/Deborah couple the centerpiece of any future books - even though earlier books that didn't feaure Lynley have sold dramatically less well. It looks like her absorption with ""growing as an author"" has caused her to badly misjudge why people bought her books. Witness ended on a dark and dreary note that only bodes ill for future books. I recommend that George fans start looking for another favorite author."
2,Disappointed,"Ms. George's books have usually kept me reading to the very end unable to put the book down until finished. I found this book plodding, repetetive and I had to force myself to finish it. Barbara Havers was still the one bright and interesting character, but the rest were just boring. While the end was sad and depressing, Lynley's character needs more depth and color and this might take it in that direction. I hate giving an Elizabeth George book 2 stars because I have had so much enjoyment from the previous ones, but this one became tiresome."
3,Hard to get through,"I've not read any of this series prior to reading this book, so it was hard to get really involved with the characters. As an American, it was also hard to follow some of the dialect, since it is written in ""British"" (and the author made a few mistakes, such as having one of her characters refer to something in inches). I kept imagining the British accent, and that slowed me down. Bad guy was pretty easy to guess, although there were a few twists I didn't see coming. Not sure if I'll pick up any more of this series."
1,Worse book George has written,"This is the last book written by George that I will buy. I bought, read and enjoyed all her earlier titles. Her choice for whom to kill off and the effects on Lynley and Havers indicate to me that she is trying to end/kill off the series. Otherwise, why would she make such a cruel decision? Her rightful choices as a writer for this title prompt me to use my rightful choice as reader to write her off."
2,A disappointment,"I have read every one of Elizabeth George's Lynley series, so it was with anticipation that I sat down to read her latest. Before I had read many pages, I found myself getting bored. By the time I was halfway through the book, I gave up on it and read the last 40-50 pages, which are harrowing but, to me, a disappointment. I felt that killing off a major character -- or two characters, as the case was -- is a quick and dirty way of keeping the series going. Come on -- how often does something like that happen in real life? The thing I have liked about George's previous novels is that they had a ring of truth -- that this is the way life really is. Now that she's joined the serial killer bandwagon like almost every other mystery writer, I think she has lost her unique voice. The jury's still out on whether I will read her next book."
1,"Depressing, disappointing, perplexing","Curious that Elizabeth George would consider herself unequal to the challenge of writing about a happy marriage. In earlier works, she fearlessly took on subjects, such as the Pakistani experience in the UK, that are manifestly much father away from what she knows; or, as in A Place of Hiding, took the highly risky approach of leaving her main character out of the story at all. Yet her courage failed her before the creative challenge of writing well about happiness, and she took the low road of simply killing off Lynley's wife. The result is a short-term storm of interest (the publicity around the plot was enormous) bought at the price of a permanent loss of the interest, the vital balance of light against darkness, that held the series together. With No One as Witness was depressing, disappointing, and perplexing; and the outlook forfuture books from this author is unappetizing."
4,4 stars except for,"the horrible ending!! I have read all of the series and love the intricate plotting and the well-developed characters....feel as if I know them and care for them. So, was devastated at the ending (will not give it away in case you haven.t read it). Does this mean Ms. George is dropping the series? It was the usual page-turner, can't put down novel."
2,Betrayed and manipulated,"While Ms. George delivers an intriguing tale about a serial killer of young boys populated by our regular cast of characters of Lynley, Havers, Nkata, Simon and Deborah, she left this reader feeling betrayed when she killed off Lynley's wife Helen and their unborn child. Clearly this was an author manipulation to keep Lynley isolated and conflicted, but in the process, she's lost this long-time reader of the series."
2,Disappointed,"I loved ""What Came Before He Shot Her"". The character development was superb as was the development of the locale ambience. But this book is just the opposite: skimpy character development relying on cliches. And the story line is like ""number 4 hold the mayo"" serial killer crime story: been there, seen that 100 times."
4,Excellent writing,"I found the writing to be excellent in this novel by Elizabeth George. While this is a long running series, this is my first book to read. While the book sometimes points toward events in the past, I did not feel I had missed essential points, but instead was encouraged to read the volumes which has come before. This book about a serial killer of adolescent boys has a great deal of grit to it and definitely is not a cozy. I think the closest comparison I can make as to others authors may be Louise Penny with a great deal more grit and nastiness in both language and subject matter. I find both of them to be excellent writers, however. And just as I enjoy Penny's forays into French phrases, I also enjoyed George's British phraseology. I found this to be a 4.5 star offering only because it starts a little slow."
5,Great mystery with a shocking conclusion,I am a great fan of Elizabeth George and this is one of her very best. It is just very sad that we will have to wait another year for the next installment ! !
1,Elizabeth George has lost her touch,"Once again, Elizabeth George has turned her back on the kind of mystery that made her reputation and produced a novel that is too long, overburdened by subplots, and curously riddled by factual errors. This time, she attempts a psychopathic serial killer novel, but falls far short of the level set by masters such as Ruth Rendell or James Patterson. The killer is neither creepy nor sympathetic, and is not even responsible for the most crucial death in the book. After three mediocre books, George seems unable to turn out another mystery like the early ones that were so highly acclaimed. It seems that this author, who fearlessly takes on subjects (such as the Pakistani experience in Britain) utterly removed from her realm of experience, was undone by the challenge of writing about a happily married Lynley."
4,Why Isn't This Being Rated Higher?,I found this a roller coaster ride and am frankly surprised (to say the least) at it's low rating by others. My frustration is that she only writes about one book every year and a half and I'm dying to know where she is going to go with this - if anywhere. I did not find it overly complex (This from someone who has to write down Ludlum characters as they appear in his later books in order to keep them straight). I found it an extremely moving book and would recommend to anyone who likes her works.
1,HATED the ending - -0 stars,"I've waited breathlessly for each book of this series to be published. I've been disappointed with a several which focus on minor characters like class-fixated, boring Barbara Havers. George's best books in this series have ""starred"" the Lyndleys and their best friends, of whom I am most fond. Strong plots, interesting relationships, and intelligence characterize these books, particularly the early ones.This book is the worst of the series. Serial killers have been SO overdone, and George doesn't do them as well as other authors. Maybe George is simply tired of the characters. The ending shocked and revolted me. What a dirty trick on George's faithful readers.I will never buy or read another book in this series."
1,"Boo to you, Ms. George","I bought this book because I loved the books Elizabeth George has written before.What a mistake! This book reads as if she's tired of all her characters and wanted to smash their lives to bits, which she effectively does by killing off an essential and beloved character in a way that's unconnected to the rest of the plot but that punches a hole in her cast.What's wrong with Elizabeth George? The book feels like a wanton act of destruction. Surely this master plotter could have come up with a better way to get the Lynleys offstage. Boo to you, Ms. George."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a frustrating read for me. I miss the way Mrs. Geeorge wrote her first 4-5 Lynley books. I had a hard time staying focused in the middle and the plots were conveniently tidied up in the end without making much sense. I was so happy to get this book for Christmas but I was so frustrated after reading it. Die hard George fans will be happy with how things play out for Havers. Come on, Mrs. George, get back to rocking our literary world!"
4,Best In Quite A While,"I've read all of the books in this series, but had grown very impatient with the neuroses of the characters & their disfunctional relationships and the overblown & tedious descriptions of almost everything they encounter. I had moved on to Denise Mina (wonderful) and didn't plan to buy this latest, but I'm glad a friend talked me into it.For once, the length didn't annoy me to distraction (though George still needs a real editor in my view). My hope now is that losing Helen gets us out of the emotional hothouse. If the next book has Lynley taking over Deborah's role as the weepy head hair shirt, I'm gone, but if the plot keeps center stage & the remaining four don't have relationships with anyone else who drips egg yolk all over their fronts, I'll be back."
2,ARGH.,"I can't believe I actually was looking forward to reading this book. I loved Elizabeth George. I read every one of her novels, painstakingly (at times) getting to know everyone, feeling excited that Tommy and Helen would have a child, adding a new dimension to the relationships. But no, let's not let our characters be happy, for crying out loud. Let's KILL the pregnant one and end it with Havers crying. How depressing and how utterly disappointing. I can't even say as I miss Helen--I am still trying to understand why she was killed off. ??? Not a fan, I'm afraid. Just not a fan."
3,Not Her Best Effort,"I have been a long-time fan of Elizabeth George, but this book is a sad ending for the Lynley legacy. Although I believe Barbara Havers is the heart of George's novels, I think there could have been a more graceful way to chronicle the winding down of Lynley's career. After enduring Helen and Thomas's ups and downs before their marriage, I was appalled at this monstrous ending. As tiresome as their relationship was, it hardly deserved this tragedy.As other reviewers have noted, the mystery was secondary in this novel. It was hard to keep track of it with all the problems at headquarters.I hope EG doesn't abandon Havers and Nkata. They are the most interesting characters in her long series. They can easily carry the series on their own."
5,Wow!,"Another great entry in this series. Lynley, Havers and Winston Nkata are in fine form, and the serial killer plotline is a nice change of pace. The ending is courageous and simply devastating. Where does she go from here?"
3,Better than last,"I do not feel this book is one of Elizabeth George's best Lynley books, but certainly an improvement over ""A Place of Hiding,"" which hardly seemed like it belonged in the series. I was not disappointed by the ""sad"" ending as I thought that particular plot line really had no where to go anyway. It did leave me looking forward to the next book in the series, to see what might be ahead for Lynley and Havers. I think there will be some new directions taken and am very anxious to see what happens next. Again, not her best, but things are looking up!"
3,wrong,"This may give away the ending, so don't read it if you don't want to know:I have read all of George's books, and this one started out to be among the best. From the liner notes I knew something bad was going to happen, but I never expected it to be something so egregious and especially unjustified by the plot of the book. If the main protagonist had committed the crime, that would have made sense. For it to be so random made it meaningless. After following Lynley and Helen's relationship for so long, watching it develop, to have it end like this was cruel.The book was good; the way she handled the ending was terrible. I'm sure I will continue to read her stories because of Havers and Nkata, as others have said, but I am sadly disappointed."
1,Poor showing for George,"I share the opinion of many other readers of With No One as Witness: George should have stuck to full tapestry murder mysteries, which she does well; instead of attempting a psycho serial killer novel, which she did badly. Very badly indeed. Oh, and it's definitely cheating to kill off a main serial character, especially when the killing has no relation to the rest of the plot. It suggests that the writer lacks the imagination or the energy to keep the character spinning. That's probably why so many reviewers have said this book felt ""tired"" and ""sloppy"". Again, I agree. George should stay off the literary scene till she gets her energy back."
2,Not up to her usual standard,"I am very disappointed with this latest book by Elizabeth George.As a big fan of hers I expected better than this.The book is overlong,confusing and the ending was a big shock and made no sense whatever.Killing off one of her major caricatures was a big mistake and I cannot see where she will go from here with future books in the Lynley series.Maybe that is what she has in mind.No more Detective Inspector Lynley books."
1,Don't Read This If You Don't Want to Know What Happens.,"I give up on Elizabeth George. She has killed Helen for no good reason. Elizabeth George has joined a line of authors I will no longer read because they have found it necessary to dispose of a key character for no good reason other than shock value, or to take another character in a new direction. That is lazy writing if you ask me."
3,Not as good as her other books,"I have read and enjoyed every Elizabeth Geporge book, and can't wait until they come out. Finally, the dull, totally unlikeable Helen dies, (not that I like to see to see innocent people killed)."
4,Excellent,"I loved this book. One of the best of the series. The ending was unexpected, but I am not unhappy about it. I think the series will be driven in into a new direction, just as exciting as before, but with newer and broader expectations.I can't wait for the next book."
3,With No One As Witness,"I have been a fan of Elizabeth George since her first book. I loved her depth of characters and felt like I knew each and every one. I pushed one of my sons and my daughter to read her books, which they did and was always raving about her writing. At the end of ""With No ONe As Witness"", I threw her book across the room and burst into tears - I was devasted - so senseless. I said I would never read her again. Many months later I purchased the following book supposedly explaining ""With No One As Witness"". I still have not been able to pick it up and read it. I have no idea at this point whether I will ever touch another of her books again.LaRae Mullin"
3,Disappointed and disillusioned,"I am very disappointed by the ending in this book and very disillusioned with Ms. George for it. I have been reading this series since 1988. Surely she could have come up with a less troublesome ending than she did for this, the 13th (and I guess unlucky) installment in an otherwise great series.Even if she keeps writing the series, I am not sure that I will EVER read her again. I feel betrayed - like I lost a good friend."
1,Thumbs down for With No One As Witness,"This intellectually and morally unsatisfying narrative hits a new low for George. The serial killer is poorly drawn, the murder of Lynley's wife is unrelated to the plot, and justice is not done. Like many other readers, I got the impression that George has simply run out of ideas of what to do with her cast and chose the most cliched way out of her dilemma. How odd. How awful."
3,Really Disappointed,"I am a HUGE Elizabeth George fan. I have read all her books. But this one made me mad. I thought the possible suspects given to us were transparent, and that the ending was ""deus ex machina."" But most of all, I hated what she did with two of the continuing characters. I genuinely like her main characters and consider her psychological mining into their beings to be a part of her books' appeal. Perhaps she is bored with them. Or knew no other way to grow these characters. I was saddened and maddened by the ending. I feel cheated. I will not buy her next book until I've read a good deal of the beginning. Ms. George is going to have to win me back."
4,Still love the characters,"The murder mystery itself was not that exciting but I really enjoyed the character development of Lynley, Havers and Nkata. The tragedy in Lynley's personal life was disheartening but perhaps life will improve in the future. I'm not sure why George put that twist in - it was a surprise to me. I recommend the book and can't wait to read the next one."
2,Design flaw needs to be fixed,"I purchased this Wren house a few months ago. None have moved in yet so I relocated it to a spot where they had nested previously. The day after I moved it, disaster struck! What happened was that the round wooden stick that runs the length of the apex of the roof, and to which the hook attaches, became detached from the house and the house fell to the ground. Just two staples attached the house to the hook bar and they easily separated. I used a nail gun to reattach the hook bar to the house so hopefully it will stay attached.Edit (2/2012): I was looking back through my old reviews and noticed the picture for this item doesn't look like the same as the one I had reviewed initially. The round wooden stick that runs the length of the roof does not appear to be present, judging from the current picture. So maybe it has been resolved in this version."
3,Wren House Review,Of the 2 shipped one had the hanger broken off when it arrived. They are cute but not top quality. NO wrens have been here to give their review yet.
2,Item was not as pictured or described,"This is a great album that I enjoy, but in terms of what I received when I ordered this product, it did not meet my expectations. The album art and packing posted was not what came in the mail when I bought this product. I expected a vinyl that comes in regular packaging, but instead I received a cheap and thin see through plastic casing. I was very disappointed by this because I was hoping to frame this album art. While this is a great album I would surely not buy it from this seller. I hoped to purchase a new item as is pictured and described yet I received a cheap and flimsy product. I am quite unhappy with this purchase."
3,Playing on my patio,"Just picked up this CD and it's my first Ryan Adams. I had previously heard Ryan only once on Television. Unfortunately, here in the S Florida area, the radio stations expose us to a monotonous sound of music that is just down right annoying leaving me no choice but to search outside of this area to hear and appreciate the talents that exist. Ryan Adams is one of them. What may be familiar Ryan Adams to many is a new face to a familiar sound that needs to be exposed more to the world if they would simply wake up and realize this genre. It isn't for everyone but I feel for those open minded and with a sense beyond your typical pop will enjoy this alt-country sound."
4,great cd!,"ryan adams gives us another great musical experience...a little countryish, but still full of great riffs and piercing lyrics!"
3,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to this album as a return-to-form, as some of the pre-release reviews suggested. The first thing I noticed was that it's way too compressed. There's no dynamic range on this album (Ryan Adams fans; see Heartbreaker to hear some nice, natural dynamic range). The second thing I noticed was that some of the melodies reminded me of songs from 29, one of his weakest albums.I'm still hoping this album grows on me, but the first listen was a far cry from the way I felt when I first listened to Heartbreaker, Gold, Demolition, Love is Hell 2, and Pneumonia. I'm afraid this album will rank down there with Rock n Roll and 29 for this Ryan Adams fan."
3,Toothless Tiger,"I bought this while on vacation, and I expected a lot from it since it was the only CD in my rental car. After numerous end to end playings, I can only bring two songs immediately to mind: ""Two"" is not breaking new ground, but is as achingly beautiful as any song he's done. ""Halloween Head"" is raucus and catchy, but sounds like a mailed in version of the obligatory ""talented artist who just sobered up"" song. Give me ""Detox Mansion"" every time. When you compare it to other Ryan Adams / Whiskeytown albums of the same ilk it sounds unconvincing. It's nice to listen to, but it lacks any passion."
3,Is this what we've been waiting for...?,"Let me start by saying I've always thought Ryan Adams was at the head of his class in terms of songwriting and putting out great albums. Having said that, the new album is just OK. Nothing really stands out that loudly like Cold Roses and Love Is Hell. Granted Oh My God... is a great tune and there are a couple others that are memorable. It's just missing that ""next stage"" feel. There's really no new ground covered here, unfortunately. I'm hoping the next one really takes off. Sorry guys, I really tried to like it."
2,Little too country for my tastes,"Upon my first listen to this album I could not finish it...the songs were a little too twangy and Adams' voice was as well. My taste is more on the rock side of things, and this album falls definitely more on the country side."
2,not very good,"I have enjoyed most of Adams's previous releases but not this one. Song #5 is the only keeper in my opinion. If I had listened to it first, I would not have bought it."
4,Can't stop listening to it,"Love this album. I love Ryan Adams. The only song that disappointed me was ""These Girls"" which is a remake/redo of ""Here there Mrs. Lovely"" which i prefer(it's a few years old). The new lyrics just caught me off guard. Some gems on this album, much more commercial than say, rock-n-roll and even Heartbreaker, but a nice collection of music, reflecting Mr. Ryan Adams today."
4,What a song writer.,"Very good album and I like this alot. I have all of his and this one really sinks it's teeth into me at this point in my life.very insightful, and always such a good artist. A few of the lines in the songs really speak to me lately.This one is no Ripoff.!!"
3,"All Easy, No Tiger","After an 18 month wait and great reviews from the professional critics, I thought Easy Tiger was a can't miss five star album from one of my favorite artists. Four or five listens later (didn't take long as short as the album is) I can't give it more than three stars. Or less either. With the exception of Halloween Head and maybe Tears of Gold, the album is fine, but just not interesting. The songs are pretty, pleasant--easy if you will--but they don't grab you and hang on like most Ryan Adams songs. They have no teeth. All easy, no tiger."
2,"Great Album, Misleading description","I love this album and the item that I received was in fine condition but what I received was not what I expected. Nowhere in the product description did this item say that the album did not come in the original album sleeve without liner notes or album artwork. As someone who really loves the WHOLE experience of collecting albums, the packaging almost as much as the album itself, I was really disappointed."
4,omigodthisisprettygood!!!!,"I like Ryan Adams - i'm not a huge fan or anything although i have all the Whiskeytown albums and all his solo releases except the awful Rock n' roll and 29. This is my second fav after Cold Roses! To put it simply this rocks!!!!. The melodies are nice, his voice is beautiful and cover is cool. I like the fact that is album is quite economic and concise with no laspes in taste (except for the swearing!!!!) Why does he feel the need to ruin a perfectly good song by SWEARING!!!! Swearing is not cool kids, and when Ryan swears on record it always seems lame. If it wasn't for the bad language i would give this album 5 stars!!!!!!!!"
2,Are the critics hearing the same album?,"Maybe two or three songs are of the standard I associate with Ryan Adams. He has a lot of great songs and a lot of bad songs. This album, along with 29, is consisted of mostly bad songs. It seems like he's doing it to just do it - the single Two is a good example of this - come on Ryan, you can do better than that. It's a snoozer for me..."
2,Another snoozer,Ryan - please reunite with Whiskeytown or go back to what you were going for Gold / Heartbreaker.The last 6 or 7 albums aren't remotely as good as your first ones.
2,I really dislike this album,I bought this CD after reading many favorable reviews.There are 2 songs that I really like and every other song to me sounds funky and some of the songs sound like country music to me. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
2,.,"Finally taking the plunge he had toyed with for a decade, mediocre and sad adult-contemporary cheese by a guy whose only apparent effort to retain ""hip cred"" is the ""420"" glowing embarassingly on his watch on the cover."
2,Pass on this. Get the books instead.,"Read Cricket in the Web by Paula Moore and Murder Near the Crosses by Peter Sandman. Pass on this video.This DVD comes across as an inadequate, highly summarized account of a very complicated case.The books hold your interest; this puts you to sleep."
1,THEY MADE ME SAD,"I honestly bought these because of the Anne Klein name. These were horrible. The peek toe gripped my big and next to it toe in a stronghold pinching grip....I do not have fat feet or toes. I walked 10 feet and almost had to crawl back. The curve, which should have been at the arch was on my heel. These are VERY uncomfortable. I found them true to size but not true to the name...ANNE get these shoes off the market! Also they looked cute with the quilted texture, but looking down they looked like a blanket. Save your money or you can get the pair I am sending back. They made me sad."
3,Anne Klein Shoes,"Nice shoes, but they run small. I ordered Size 10, and they are tight, and the shoes do not come in size 10.5 or 11."
4,"pretty good, the best for melting","These are awesome for melting for dipping, perfect consistency. Could have a little bit more pb taste, but still pb enough taste to be effective!"
1,Book not very helpful,I'm amazed that this book is for MBA level students! I am currently an undergraduate student and have the opportunity to use this textbook for a finance class and find this book very vague on termology and not very helpful when it comes to difficult concepts. Anyone with basic knowledge of business can understand the book so that's why it amazes me that this book is used for MBA's!
4,it IS a perilous proposal,"This book does keep you on the edge of your seat at times. It is a nice story, and is, most definitely HISTORICAL fiction. You could easily place it as a true story way back then. In my opinion, if you love history and some action/adventure, then you will most likely find this book enthralling, but if you are more like me you will find it okay. Average. I still did enjoy it, and I can't deny it was interesting. It did keep me wondering what would happen. I would recommend this as a good book."
4,Dissect everyone.....,"In Space Man, we're treated to a genuine, low bugdet, sci-fi, gangster, kung-fu, comedy, love story. I saw this as a refreshing break from the hi-tech, mega bugdet, CGI bloated features we've been seeing. It's the story of a man who was kidnapped as a young boy by space aliens and returns back to earth 25 years later. During his time away from earth, he has been trained and conditioned to be the ultimate hunter/fighter/killer and now has to try and assimilate back into earth culture. I thought this movie was pretty funny, and for it's budgetary limitations, it had some pretty good fight scenes and effects. While the movie was made for around $50,000, it looks like the director got the most out of it he could. I would be interested in seeing what he could do with a larger budget. It's nice to know that movies like this can still be made. If you liked this, I would also recommend Dark Star."
3,high marks for camp only,"The production values are not high. The budget obviously wasn't, either. But for pure ""campiness"" and humor, Spaceman is fun to watch. It probably doesn't belong in everyone's video library, but would be worth renting, if you're into Sci-Fi."
4,Spaceman,"Watching this movie feels like you're goofing around and playing with a bunch of your friends. It doesn't try too hard to hide that the lead pipes they're hitting eachother with are cardboard. It lets you in on it, it feels like any one of the actors at some point are going to look at you and say, ""What do you want to play now?"". At one point a car drives past the guy he's supposed to pick up and inside the driver says, ""Oh, I screwd that one up."". On the commentary track Scott Dikkers says how that was the actor's natural reaction to accidently missing his mark but Dikkers just left it in.Scott Dikkers is such a genius. I wish everybody could see the stuff he's done. His cartoon Jim's Journal is so beautiful, his short films give a better idea of what he can do with more money, The Onion, and this other book ""You Are Worthless"" which I wrote another review of here. It's so easy to love him for the work he's let us seen."
1,blah,"if you like the onion and want to see what a movie by an onion person is like, then get this. while the onion is funny at times, this movie is... ummm... bad. stupid flick. lame script. bad direction. as far as comedy goes, watching an infomercial is funnier. action? the worst hong king flick is a million times better than this thiing. avoid."
5,LAKE OF DREAMS,"This is a great Cd to fall asleep with, or to just use as a dreamy background. It is like a guided meditation and leads you to wonderful places of your imagination! Highly recommended."
3,Tough read: but worth it,This book was written by a professor and proves for me that the Gospel of Thomas was a separate tradition and not a gnostic corruption of the biblical gospels. Patterson goes into the linguistics of the Coptic Gospel of Thomas and the Greek biblical Gospels to show that Thomas stands alone in its own tradition.This book was intended more for the highly educated with Coptic and Greek interwoven with the text at the beginning of the book. I can read Koine Greek and I had a difficult time reading and understanding the first half of the book due to the Coptic. You are are curious about the Gospel of Thomas this book will educate you. I hope in the future Professor Patterson writes books more structured for the lay reader.
2,Inevitably weak comeback,"About a year ago, everyone would have guessed 50 Cent had KO'ed Ja Rule for good, and Ja wasn't coming back. Man, were we ever wrong! Ja Rule seems to be his old self again, making generic pop hits with Ashanti again, except he recruited R. Kelly this time around, which proved to be a pretty smart move. R. Kelly outshines Ja and Ashanti on this track, also saving it from earning a ""wack"" grade. It looks like Ja has his Rule back."
1,Not for Kids,"I bought this show after having my child's foot measured. He wore it once and his big toe blistered up about double in size from rubbing the inside of the hard shell-top of this shoe. Dad didn't learn his lesson the first time and bought the same shoe a few months later in a larger size of course and the same thing happened again. My advice, buy shoes made for children and not miniature adult shoes."
3,decent mystery,"This was an enjoyable enough mystery. It began well, but did drag at parts in the second half. I liked Lupica's Wild Pitch (for adults)and Travel Team (for kids) much more. It seemed that Lupica was trying to appeal to both audiences with this book, and did okay with both, but this was not a home run (or I should say a 3 point swish). I would most recommend this to teen readers who are in between kid and adult reads."
1,"Lupica Shoots, Clank..another brick.",Lupica is at the very least consistent. He is consistently bad.Story lacked depth and intrique to keep a reader interested. Recommend if you having trouble with a sleep disorder.
5,Reveiw,"Kevin Bloody Wilson is the funniest Australian comedic singer in Australia! Rodney Rude is without a doubht the best stand up comedian, but Wilson writes the songs that just make ya piss ya self laughing!Its just too bad that all his earlier albums are not listed here! ""Your Average Australian Yobbo"" ""Born Again Pisstank"" ""Kevs back"" are the three best must have albums! They are still available in Australia and i'd recomend them more then this album. You might be able to purchase it at his web site kevin.bloody.wilson.com.au but this greatest hits is still worth it if you havent heard him before! Elsewise i'd recomend ""Let Loose Live in London"" if you want to hear some of them live, and some stand up material aswell!Seeing Kev Live is a great experience and youll never forget it! and his albums will always be the funniest of comic singing of all time!"
3,Hawaiian War Chant,"I love the version of the ""Hawaiian War Chant"" on this album. It is driving, thoroughly ""Americanized"" and yet great fun.Overall, should Hawaiian music be given the big band treatment? Well, if you don't think so, just argue it out with Arthur Godfrey.I also thought Mancini's use of the ""solid body harpsichord"" to arrange Hawaiian music was something else - never repeated, so far as I know."
4,Bought as gift,"I bought this for my brother who has a 2008 Yamaha V-star, so this review is not actually a hands on review. The shipment was fast, and the product came in excellent condition. Quality was great, and they looked better even than the picture. Really, I don't know what else to say as I'm not using them."
3,"Interesting, but sadly dated","Other reviewers have offered a preview of the storyline of this interesting book here, so I will not revisit their efforts.Suffice to say that this is certainly an interesting trilogy, written well before sci-fi was something that we all are fascinated with, but alas it has dated badly, and I think that many people will find its apparent racism somewhat confronting.However, our hero is indeed heroic, and the heroine appropriately feisty and chaste, and their efforts to survive and establish a new society in the devestation of the old one are somewhat entertaining.It isn't great post apocolypse fiction, but it is certainly interesting as an example of an early attempt at this genre."
5,for the time it was written - Phenomenal,"by George Allan England - a trilogy written around 1912 & the first of its kind, a science fiction, futuristic story of survival. Keeping in mind when it was written, I found it an odd but interesting read I couldn't put down & not my normal genre."
2,it tech,"Clean new install, works great. 1st trouble or re-install, send it (scanner) to the trash bin, tech support very expensive & useless. Simply cannot be re-installed. This is the 2nd hp scanner we've had w/ the same failure to reinstall problem. We've had 3390 for about 2 - 3 years, prn still works great on all 4 computers on the network, scanner has not worked in 3-1/2 years on the same computers on the same network."
4,A solid printer,"The document feeder leaves a little something to be desired, setting up the network printing required a little googling, and some of the software that came with the printer was hogging all of my CPU until I disabled it. Other than that, I've loved the features and quality of this printer."
2,Beware if you have Vista 64Bit,"Had this printer for about 1 year. Worked great with XP home. I just upgraded my computer and it came with Vista Home Premium 64Bit. I can print, but not get all the scanner functions to work. Especially my bank deposits which I do by scanning them to the bank. I order the full installation CD but it doesn't seem to work. I can't even get the software to install. Try getting help from HP support and they want to charge you $25 for online chat, for a problem that they cannot resolve. I'm not paying another $25 when I paid $23 for the CD that was supposed to work.If you are buying a new printer be double sure it works with windows vista-64"
2,Buyer Beware,"If you are using Microsoft Vista 64, you may wish to consider another AIO, as for the time being (and for over a year to date) this will be a printer only. I receieved the following from HP customer service, ""the full printing software of HP Laser Jet printers is not available for the Windows Vista 64-bit Operating system."" This means I can't copy, scan,or fax to or from my PC. Unbelievable.Since I am not changing my OS, I need to research whether HP's competitors are compatable with Microsoft Vista 64.As a nice looking, quiet, but rather expensive printer, it works well."
1,HP 3390 TRASH!!!,"JUNK! GARBAGE! LAND FILL! If you bought one I am sorry but you have a boat anchor! I own two in two different offices and regret every time I try to use it. I will be replacing both as soon as I can afford it. The printer often stops working or communicating with clients. The ""Scan to"" feature trashes itself. My employees have given up on scanning and have gone back to our old manual scanner. Software is the most bloated and useless bit of vaporware HP has produced. I have loaded it multiple times on PC's and Mac's and it continues to work for a while and then just stops - reinstalling is the only simple fix. I am an HP faithful having owned many many of their printers of all types since 1987 but this one really really is the worst. I wish I could throttle whoever at HP was the product manager on this one"
1,HP = Horrible Product,"I'm an HP fan, but this product is just terrible. The software is a joke. This is geared at small businesses and fails miserably. It's so bad I'm going back to my vendor and begging for a return.I sell a lot of HP product, mostly Servers, and have a previous version of an AIO, the LJ3030. The LJ3030 beats this hands down and it's three years old. This an example of a new product launched with no QA or concern for copany reputation and sole focus on churning and burning a few dollars. Shame on HP."
2,"Good hardware, sorry software","The hardware on this printer is excellent. It shares the same toner cartrigde as the 1320. However, the software sucks, sucks, sucks. If you plan on using this with one or two computers in a single room, you should be fine. If you plan on using this in a business environment, you will be stymied.THIS IS A CONSUMER PRINTER!!!The HP auto updater can't work with a proxy server.Their is no fax confirmation for network users.The printer can only be managed via the USB interface.Fax logs can only be accessed through the USB interface.Tech support for this printer is clearly consumer, not business, oriented.The printer is very fast, very quite, nicely built, integrated handles, solid feeling.The software is sucks.If you are using with one or two computers in the same room, you should be very happy."
5,Rapido,"This charger is pretty great for what it does, charging my cellphone battery. I can only compare this with the original charger that came with my previous Nokia cellphone. I still have that one, but it's in the box now, which is in the closet. I have been able to charge my phone from the point where it was dropping signals and beeping at me to the where my phone had four clicks above the battery, in one hour! That's pretty good if you ask me. Plus if you are looking for an alternative or an extra, the rapid charger actually costs less than the standard charger.The charger does come in two pieces, wire and the wall plug assembly. Assembly is easy, just make sure if one end of the wire doesn't fit, try the other end!"
2,Web development overview with a bit of XP,"Beware, agile methods make up less than half the content in this light-weight book. Gives an overview of the web development process with a mere 28 pages devoted to XP coding for the web - focusing on XML. If not technical, discussions on managing web design and creativity in teams would have been great. Alas, not to be. A superficial single-afternoon read filled with white spaces, half-page cartoons and paragraphs on the obvious."
1,Just a list of problems with no solution,I read about the first 1/3 of the book and found that it does list the problems encounted in web project ( general software project) but unfortunately I failed to found practical solutions for these problem in this part of the book. I guess the remaining part won't be much better. So I decided to gave up reading.
4,A nice overview of the study of Social Capital,"This book was a nice overview of the field of work done over the past century around Social Capital. At times the author was, perhaps, being a little critical of former theorists, but offered excellent references."
4,Steal Away,"My book that I am presenting to you is Steal Away. Steal Away is about two women named Susannah and Bethelehem. Susannah's uncle owns Bethelehem because she is a slave. Susannah and Bethelehem are trying to get to Vermont from Virginia. On foot trying to get away from war. Susannah's uncle died. On their way to Vermont they meet somebody and they suggest that they should go to Canada. The main characters in this story are Susannah and Bethelem. Both of them I think are really brave,caring,and strong women. I think they're strong because they knew that they didn't have any transportation except their feet and they took advantage of it. I would recommend this book to people who like adventurest books about the Civil War. I think if someone who did like books like that would say that this is the best book they ever read in their life."
3,A Fine but Needs Work in Writing!,"The story of two girls, a white orphan and an African American slave girl, and their friendship fleeing the South before the Civil War could be an intriguing tale. But sadly, the writer uses flashbacks and a reunion about 40 years later in order to help relate the story. I believe the writer would have been more effective if she had followed the story's narrative in 1855 and then progressed until 1896.Sometimes, simple storytelling could be just as effective without using writer's devices like flashbacks. The book is aimed for young readers. Even though I'm not young, I was confused by how the book unfolded. While the book has a great story, it just needs to be told in a better format and revised for future readers."
2,"Interesting idea, poor execution","I enjoy reading about the many and varied forms of travel, so an account of an African adventure by microlight was intriguing. I felt that both the location and method of travel offered exciting possibilities. I was disappointed, however, by the account that was written in the book. The author, not a pilot but rather a student, travels with her flight instructor. Yet I never got the feeling he was part of the adventure at all. He was there to pilot, instruct the author, and seemingly act as so much a 'driver/mechanic' for our 'intrepid adventurer.' When the slightest hint of trouble with the aircraft cropped up, the author abandons both plane and pilot to carry on alone, leaving him to catch up after making repairs. I was let down that Ms. Dodwell seems to take pleasure in the novelty of the adventure - a photo of her alone with the plane is on the cover - while a major team member of the expedition was shuffled to a minor role in the book."
1,NOTELESS,I did not think the book was noteworthy. A hodgepodge of unrelated interchanges between two people. Maybe take each one and turn it into something useable.
4,Nice Job by Hero Cop,"Kouri, whom I'm familiar with thanks to the editors at Police Times and The Narc Officer, has written a nice, succinct book that's perfect for a busy guy like me. I enjoy being able to read one chapter in the gym and not have to worry about forgetting where I left off. Each chapter is a separate article (which is what he did. collected articles he wrote for police magazines like Police Career Digest and crime zines like the now defunct Sonny Grosso project, Crime Beat. I would have give the CD rom the other star, but i wish he didn't include Liddy and North. They get enough publicity and coverage. And Kouri didn't need people with celebrity status."
1,No appeal to the selection,"This had absolutely no appeal for the general public. What was the author thinking? If a writer is going to write specialized material, then don't try to put it in the hands of everyday people. This belongs to law inforcement interest areas only. And even then, only to those interested in days of old. There are much more up to date subjects to be written about. I doubt anyone else would even care to invest their time."
1,Is reading a CD convenient?,"I have to agree with other reviews about this book/CD. I'm not sure how convenence could even figure into the whole thing. Seems like a paperback would be a lot easier, you can fold the pages donwn to mark your spot, so what's the idea behind it? I didn't really care for reading interviews. It reminded me of having to read transcripts or acts in a play. I like books to be a little more enjoyable. If I want facts, there's always the newspaper or the history section at the public library."
1,I had mixed feelings about the book.,"It was geared more towards stating names, dates, and facts. I really would've enjoyed fiction drawn from real life. You get so tired of hearing about the corruption and the over powering influence of the unscrupulous characters in today's society, as well as the one's that are well known from days gone past. I did not enjoy the back and forth sections of the questions and answers. Story form would have made a more reader friendly format."
1,WARNING - THIS VERSION IS NOT ILLUSTRATED!,"This is the worst edition of Capek's War with the Newts I've ever seen. Other editions I've seen are full of interesting illustrations and fake 'newspaper clipping' images to help heighten and convey different aspects of the plot. Not that this is at all necessary as it's a great book on it's own - but if you're putting ""illustrated edition"" on the cover of the book and only including one or two very poorly executed images, well, all I can think to say is shame on you. Add to this the fact that I counted nearly one copy error per page of the book, and all I can say is don't waste your money on this edition, and in fact, stay away from any titles published by 'the echo library' altogether."
2,Terrible font size and layout,There were no illustrations and the font was too small to read comfortably. The layout was also very uncomfortable to read. Dissatisfied with the printing job.
5,Still Timely and Still Amazing (and funny too),"""If you were to look for the little island of Tana Masa on a map"" today, you probably wouldn't find it. It must surely have been obliterated by the tsunami of 2004. But the prescient, wonderous and disasterous story of Capt.van Toch, G.H. Bondy, Mr. Povondra, and, above all, Andy (Andrias Scheuchzeri) will, fortunately, always be available to warn, entertain, enthrall and amaze us. In several languages, some of them unknown, in addition to English. Very highly recommended."
5,tale of the future past,"Intelligent amphibious creatures (newts) who can speak and use tools are discovered in Indonesia. Scientists, movie stars, corporations, politicians and armies all take an interest in encounters that are sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, but always thought provoking in their gentle satire of how people tend to behave when confronted with something new. Capek wrote this book in 1936, a time of technological and political upheaval. This book combines an absorbing plot and humorous flourishes with a fictional examination of how destructive humankind's collective behavior can be despite the best intentions. The book has aged well-- Capek wasn't very interested in technology, but rather in exploring how his fictional but often very familiar world reacts to a big, unexpected change."
4,Just a good story....,"I remember when I was a child and I used to be so fascinated with certain stories because the plot just kept getting better and better and the stioy was so good that it always made me want to read more. This is exactly how I felt about war with the newts. The story line was so interesting and funny that I just wanted to read more to see what was going to happen next. A unique part of this book was it's ongoing footnotes, which provided humorous additions to the plot or just gave interesting facts that made the story even more appealing. If you want to feel like a kid again and just enjoy fantasy like story, read War with the Newts."
4,Another awesome movie from Olaf Ittenbach!,"I *beep* loved this movie! It definitely deserves more than 4.6 (the rating that it has on IMDB)! The first 40 minutes are pretty slow (not boring, just slow), but after that it gets really entertaining and it has A LOT of AWESOME gore (a few effects look pretty cheap though)! Oh and it has the craziest intro in a movie ever! The acting is bad, but I don't care (and no one should) because acting isn't important in low-budget gory movies, so I give it 8/10!If you like some of Olaf Ittenbach's movies, you'll probably like this one!"
1,The Haunting Of Rebecca Verlaine,The best thing I can say about this lackluster horror movie is that I turned it into a very nice Christmas present.
4,EXCELLENT ACTION/DRAMA,"AN ANTI-TERRORIST GROUP ,AT-13, THAT ANSWERS TO NO ONE GOES AFTER TERRORISTS THAT THREATEN THE SAFETY AND STABILITY OF ALL FREEDOM LOVING NATIONS. THEY WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER WITH EACH DOING THEIR SPECIAL JOB."
1,Waste of paper,"This is a book written by a bitter, lonley, zealous woman with a lot of venom for anyone in the past that did not like her, and fake glorification for those she did like.By her own admission in this book, an alcohol addiction almost destroyed her life and this book can verify that."
5,Nude Review,"""Johnny Gumbo's Nude Lounge"", The Very Best of the Black Sorrows is a different title for a different CD. If you are after top quality mastering and good presentation then this is the Sorrows CD for you.Unlike ""The Chosen Ones"" best of, this CD has many tracks that go beyond what you can hear on radio. This means that top quality Sorrows songs such as ""The Big Time"", ""Dear Children"", ""Down To The Sea"", ""Caribbean Wind"", (Dylan)and many others can be enjoyed, as well as the more popular tracks.Joe Camilleri has put together an outstanding CD that shows a lot of thought. In every aspect this CD shines even though he described the task of compiling the CD as ""not the sweetest gig"". The process may have not been to sweet, but it is worth every minute invested to have such a great compilation.If you are looking for a Sorrows album to buy it would be hard to go past this one."
1,Schnorrer and name dropper,"I believe the author has taken another weak stab at weaseling some more dollars out of a periphial relationship with Sid.(maybe once he stood in line behind Sid when getting his morning Bialy?)Since I am reviewing this, I also belive it should clearly be labeled as a work of fiction, as it is obvious to me the author continues to be a schnorrer of others fame for his own meager financial gain in my humble opinion.Unless you know the author, (like the past reviewers, posting ""canned"" reviews) I believe you should consider your purchase of this so called ""book"" just a contribution to his retirement plan.As I said before in my title, I believe this poor excuse for a self published ""book"" is an opportunistic con, similar to a dimestore comic book."
3,Not the famous book of the same title about a balanced understanding of history,What a letdown? I was trying to buy a book about gender and history and got what appeared to be a romance novel.
5,Superb Fantasy/Romance Trilogy,"Frankly, the first time I tried reading The Chalice and the Blade, I was bored. I didn't hate it, but I wasn't the least enthralled either. However, desperate for something to read I picked it up again and gave it another chance--and thank goodness I did! The worlds McReynolds weaves in this book, and the sequels (Dreamstone and Prince of Time), are so rich and intriguing that I have since reread the trilogy several times, picking up new things I've missed in previous readings. The stories are also incredibly and breathtakingly romantic. My only disappointment is that McReynolds has since returned to writing modern romances--a shame since she displayed a true affinity for this genre."
3,dissapointing,"I was eager for a good historical read and instead I get disjointed fluff that was mostly to boring or incoherent to bother reading. The love scene was sweet and tender and about the only decent thing she wrote in the entire book, which tells me that this is simply a classy porn novel and not a romance- Boo"
1,THIS ONE IS HEADED FOR THE TRASH BIN!,"I REALLY HATED THIS STORY. THE AUTHOR JUST DUMPED CERIDWEN WITH DAIN AND LEFT HER THERE! MEANWHILE, SHE'S TOO BUSY BUILDING UP SO MANY SUBPLOTS THAT SHE HAS ALREADY COMPLETELY LOST THE STORYLINE. SHE HAS ALSO FORGOTTEN JUST WHO ARE THE HEROES (MAIN PROTAGONISTS) OF THE STORY. IT IS ONLY IN THE LAST ONE-FOURTH OF THE BOOK THAT SHE REMEMBERS TO PUT CERIDWEN BACK INTO THE ACTION (AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT)!"
5,"Couldn't put the book down, story came alive within my soul.","This book, this story is very well written. The detail and the passion put into this book brought the characters to life within my soul. The passion that this author writes with gives life to the story in such a way, that when you reach the end there is a feeling of sadness. The sadness wants the story to continue. This book was obliviously written with truths from history, which makes it much more fascinating. The way she starts the book is with complete consideration of the reader. She explains how words are pronouced, there are maps and a page or two of explanation of characters and who they are. Very well written. If fantasy with a hint of history is what you like you will love this book."
3,Read it for the Romance,"If you are expecting an exeptional fantisy story, I would not read this book. I know that writers of fantisy must sometimes be vague to add to the mystery of the magic they write about. However, McReynolds crosses the line into confusion. This is fine at some points in a story, but this confusion is the main plot of the book. I did not think that I would have enjoyed the romance as much as I did. It is not exeptionally original and very predictable, but I enjoyed the love story far more than I have enjoyed many others by writers of the same caliber. I recomend relaxing when you read this, do not sit and try to think out the plot logically. Instead, sit back and enjoy the easy reading of the beautiful love story intertwined with adventure."
3,Interesting but dragging it out.,"This began with a reasonably interesting concept and story idea, but the plot keeps draggin on. Sub-plots and secondary characters keep coming in and it's getting boring to read and to follow everything that is going on. I'm losing interest and will probably not finish the book."
3,Not what I expected of Tara Janzen,I usually love Tara Janzen's books...her contemporaries are on my re-re-read list. This had very confusing sections and some parts that went on for too long. I liked the characters but am unsure that I want to read the rest of the trilogy...certainly not for $4.99 a book...though I would pay more than that for her contemporary books...and have!
4,Enchanting,"A wonderfully told story of romance, magic, and adventure. As an avid reader of Dungeons & Dragons books and historical romance this book fulfilled both ""cravings""."
3,Good but not great!,I'm trying to design some sort of floorplan for my future log home and I thought this might give me some ideas....it's not that great. In fact I'm disappointed from what I thought it would be and should have taken more of the reviews to heart. It basically goes over building a log home...ok - well I thought it would be focused more on its title: Small Log Homes: Storybook Plans and Advice. The advice it gives is probably stuff you've already heard before...and the plans are just more of the generic ones you see from all the log home manufacturers.
4,Good Reference for Building First Log Home,This book is a great reference for the first time log home buyer. Many links to take you down other paths. Robbin outlines a few things that many new buyers should look out for in a compact way. There are also several nice photgraphs that will add to your idea database. The floor plans in the back of the book are great general floor plans to start and modify in your own way. I nearly used the entire book to plan my cabin project. Many thanks to Robbin for a great reference.
3,Not my favorite Notaro book,"I am a huge Laurie Notaro fan, and can safely state that I've read all of her books and have gotten a huge kick out of them. In general, I find her humor easy to relate to and often find myself laughing out loud to her observations and stories.However, in this book, it seemed almost as if Laurie was stretching and/or overcompensating to fill a book with humorous stories relating to Christmas. It was almost as if she was trying too hard to make some stories funny, and it just felt a little redundant. Overall, it's a quick read, and not terrible by any means.If you are choosing to read your first Lauire Notaro book, I would definitely not recommend this book, but instead recommend that you read ""The Idiot Girls Action Adventure Club"" and/or ""Autobiography of a Fat Bride"" to get a true picture of her writing abilities."
4,Holiday situations that we have all experienced,"I can identify with Laurie. I have unfortunately experienced some of these situations and had similar concerns. However, I've never discussed or confronted these infamous holiday rituals. Every chapter made me laugh. The first chapter seems a bit honest and harsh but so are the holidays. Just when you think you had a rough holiday season..."
3,Oh well.,"I've read all of Notaro's books up to this one, and unfortunately they seem to be getting less and less funny. On the first two, I laughed out loud to the point of accidentally eliciting the attention of many strangers at the dentist's office, on airplanes, etc. While reading the third book, I chuckled; while reading the fourth book, I chuckled less. During this, the fifth book, I think I only laughed once. So oh well. A good joke can't stay funny forever! I highly recommend The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club and Autobiography of a Fat Bride if you have not read them already."
2,I did not like this book,I did not like the language and did not find it as funny as others did. I do not recommend it. It is probably for a younger group.
4,Great Idiot Girl Reading,"Oh my goodness was this book a scream! For any girl who has ever felt out of place or a little dumb or tripped over her own feet this book is for you! Notaro says things I have thought over and over and this book made me laugh out loud, the first book to ever do that. I also recommend any of her other works. I feel like I'm having a stupid, enjoyable conversation with my oldest friend whenever I read her works."
4,It's Laurie Notaro--you know it will be funny.,"An extremely quick read. Almost always hilarious. A great way to spend a few hours. If you like anything else from Laurie Notaro, this book will not disappoint."
5,Pee your pants funny!,"I was introduced to Laurie by a co-worker who thought I might enjoy and I certainly did. I could not put the first one down. I can't get enough! Each books gets better and better. This Christmas my family and friends were privy to random readings from ""Top of the Naughty List."" I think this may have been the last year for bath salts. Thank God!"
2,Failed to see the magic,I did research for a light funny book for our book club and came across this book with outstanding reviews. The book was moderately funny at best. Yes it was an easy light read but nothing warranting 4 1/2 stars. Perhaps since this is the first of her books I have read it didn't have the same appeal. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,A few good/funny chapters...,A few chapters were hilarious but there were many that I could have skipped.
4,cant beat the price,We bought this at Scheels for 60 bucks and found it on amazon for 23. we returned the scheels one and are very happy with the less expensive one. it was the exact same and in good condition. i don't know why you wouldnt buy it.
3,Tripod,Lightweight and lacking for anything approaching pro use. Probably good for point-and-shoot digital cameras where weight is an issue. I soon moved up to the Manfrotto 3021PRO for use with my Rebel XTi. It's ability to hold my camera vertically wasn't very good and was too light to be a stable platform.
4,Great Choice,After reading John Hersey's Hiroshima the only thing I could say was WOW! and nothing else. It was possibily one of the greatest book I'd ever read I call this a good choice
4,An incredible book creating worldwide community,"Hiroshima is an extremely moving story that paints a very realistic picture of tragedy. Hersey does an excellent job of telling the survivors' stories in an honest, non-blaming way. Although the plot became monotonous at times, Hiroshima makes the reader think deeply and experience a sense of compassion for humankind. It is important that people from both sides of World War II's battle lines listen to the ideas and themes Hersey presents. In addition, students and adults alike can learn about the mass devastation from Hersey's honest writing style."
4,This was an excellent book!,"I thought Hiroshima was a very good book. John Hersey provided a very personal account of the atomic bomb, through the real-life experiences of six people. I learned a lot about war and the dramatic effects it has on the lives of people. Hiroshima also showed me how war can bring people together, and how the bomb, although devastating, became a common bond to all in Hiroshima, Japan. I do however feel that this book was rather one-sided. It didn't say anything about that was happening to the Americans, so it made me feel like the United States was completely wrong in dropping the bomb. All in all, I feel this is an excellent book that can teach some very valuable lessons."
4,Hiroshima,"This book is an interesting history book. It takes place when United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It gives a real life story of what happened to the civilians living, and dying in Hiroshima, and tells of their point of view of the war. This is an excellent book for everyone to read. It takes you back to when one step, one movement, one thought, meant life or death to those who lived through the atomic bomb at Hiroshima."
5,Hiroshima Is A Great True Story,"I thought this book was great. It tells about a bombing of a civilian city in Japan, called Hiroshima. When the atom bomb lands, thousands of innocent civilians are killed, and thousands of others go through pain and suffering, and many of those eventually die. The book tells about six individuals living in Japan, and each of them go through radiation sickness, depression, and the sight of watching others die around them. This book is a true story, and it lets the world know about the true devestating consequences of bombing. Although this book may seem too depressing, it is important to read about others who suffer, and it may make someone think twice before using an atom bomb."
3,jus-another-book,"In my opinion,Hiroshima was not really a good book becoz mainly the setting out of the book was too confusing for the reader.I know the writer trying to create an atmoshpere of what's happening but i find it too difficult to remember what had happen to the last character i've read.Also it was pretty much predictable and i find it hard to understand some of the words the writer use."
1,Most boring book I have ever read,"This review may annoy people who feel strongly about the book or the incident, but Hiroshima really is the driest read imaginable. I had to teach it to an extension English class and when the time came to discussing the text, all 24 students owned up to not reading it because it bored them senseless. I couldn't feel angry about that because I too found it so dull that I struggled to get through it. I ended up supplementing it with other non-fiction texts. Three successive classes have all proclaimed it the most ""boring"" book they have ever been asked to read for English. This review is more for teachers pondering using it as a study text. Don't! Your students will thank you for it."
1,Revisionist Propaganda,This book is meant to make Americans feel guilty. They should not. Dropping the bomb saved an estimated 4 million allied soldiers. Read it if you want to see things from a Japanese point of view. Then please read any book about the Pacific campaign written by an American. Your feelings of compassion for the Japanese people will quickly disappear.
4,DRAMA AND EXCITEMENT,"A stunning and compelling (MUSTREAD) story of 6 different people (Toshinki Sasaki, Masakzu Fujii, Hatsuyo Nakamura, Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Terufumi Sasaki, and Kiyoshi Tanimoto) who's lives are heavily affected by the atomic bomb USA dropped on the city of Hiroshima on August 6 1945. World War II was a war not to be forgotten and niether will this book when you read it. A little hard to follow however, when you get it, a wonderfully written story. John Hershy gives very factual details of the war, and handles the characters point of view well. He is a genious."
5,An Interesting Look at a Serious Topic,"Hiroshima is a very informitive book about a very serious event, the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. This informitave book on the lives of six people who survived the bombing dipicts what they were doing right before the bomb went off, how they protected themselves, and how they felt. In the continuation to this book John Hersey writes a fifth chapter as a sort of check up to see what the people in this book have been doing since their last interview. This book not only deserves great reviews it also deserves five stars. If you would like to read an interesting, informative book about the bombing of Hiroshima this is your book."
3,Stories of hope from the ashes of atomic warfare,"John Hersey has written a powerful novel of the Hiroshima bombing and its aftermath. To show the horror of nuclear holocaust through the eyes of the survivors is the best way to convey it. The 6 survivors documented in this book where extraordinary people who went on to do something with their lives instead of being bitter. The story that was the most inspiring was Dr.Fujii and how he helped others. Then after the war, he enjoyed life to the fullest and helped many foreigners as well. The sad thing was that even though they had nothing to do with what happened to them , the survivors were shunned even by their own people for being ""hibakusha"". To know what that is, you have to read the book. So I encourage whoever sees this review to read the book."
4,Hard to Like,"So I would give this five stars, but I just can't. This book captivated me, I couldn't put it down and all that, but it's about the death of countless thousands of people. You can't love or like a book about this subject matter. It reads well and is put together well. Following the plight of six A-Bomb victims is a horrifying experience. This updated version has an additional, ""Aftermath"" chapter in which the lives of these six individuals is updated to around 1980. I find myself looking at humanity differently now. What the crap!? How something like this happened and how little it is talked about is unbelievable. Having read basically nothing else about this subject I would have to say that this book is a good point to start at that will not allow you to ignore this piece of human happening any farther. What happened and how what happened was treated is a true sign of how sad and despicable human beings can be. This should be required reading for everyone."

2,"The message sent was good, but I didn't care for the story","Overall, I felt that Hiroshima was a mediocre book. The message that the book sent to it's audience was good, but the overall story wasn't exciting enough for me and became rather boring towards the ending of the book. I felt that some of the details included toward the ending were unnecessary and seemed to make the book drag on. One, and probably the only part of the book I did like was the first chapter, where it was described where all of the characters were when the bomb was first dropped and how far away from the center of the blast they were. I felt it was interesting to see the different activities the characters were performing at the time of the bombing and then how they were all in the same state of shock and wonder after the bomb was dropped. Overall I think that the message sent was good, but the ending probably ruined the book for me."
3,Confusing and Boring,"I read this book as a 10th grade student. The book may have been the most confusing book I have ever read. The book has 7 different accounts and each one is short and almost pointless. If Hershey only used 4 characters and went into each person's account deeper, it would have been much more interesting. Could not wait to finish this book... not for good reasons though."
3,Hiroshima,What I liked about the book was how it wasn't all bloody. What I didn't like was how it would go to one person and then go to another person then come back to the first person. I would recommend this book to poeple who like to jump around in books.
3,It's all right,"It wasn't as depressing as I thought it would be. It started slow, but after that it was O.K. so I would recommend it for people that liked the time period it was in."
3,I Understand You Teenagers!,"I am in a 11th grade Honors English Class in a tiny town in Washington State. I only have a few things to say. First, My teacher is making my classmates and I write a 15 page report to someone who has been in a deep freeze all throught the 1940's and 50's and we have to read Hiroshima and talk about it. I thought the book was not the best. I know you are all thinking that I am only a child and I don't understand Literature. But this reading is not as imformative as it should be. I still recommend it to all readers.--Edith 17 yrs old."
4,Enlightening Book,"Hiroshima is a detailed account of the events of the blast from the perspective of those who survived it. Although a bit confusing at the beginning as it introduces the six subjects in rapid succession, it held my attention reasonably well. The journalist/author does a great job in conveying the confusion, horror and lack of understanding that encompassed the event. Don't expect to draw any moral conclusions about the use of nuclear weapons from this book as it is a complicated moral issue, this book is simply a well written engrossing account of the events of the Hiroshima bomb from those who were most effected."
4,Hiroshima,"I bought the book Hiroshima and it was quite informative.The book explains through the lives of several families (who survived the blast of the Atomic Bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima) how their lives were changed forever.With their city destroyed, untold thousands died a horrible death."
5,Required reading for school?,"Our sonds teacher made him read this. He actually talked about it quite a bit and seemed to really learn alot about it's history.I was pretty impressed that a 15 year old actually found it intruiging enough to WANT to read it. KUDOS to the required reading for school. Wish I could have found it used, but ho hum."
4,Great book for people above 12:):),"This book was really good, I was quite hard to read, but I ended up understanding it the second time. I tought the six people were hard to understand, because they were all jumbled up, and not in order. I read the book as an assignment for L.A. I f you want to read a gory, confusing, just plAin weird book , well, this is the one!!!"
4,Individual Horror Rather Than Nameless Horror,"This is an excellent study of six survivors of the nuclear holocaust at Hiroshima. The author follows the lives of six people from what they were doing that morning before the bomb exploded through their immediate reactions and the following year. In the final chapter, he offers a view into their lives forty years later. It portrays the horror of the event from individual's eyes rather than the massive horror of nameless victims. It should be recommended reading for high school history classes."
4,Hiroshima was a well written and intersting novel,"I really enjoyed reading Hiroshima, this book held my attention. Before I began to read it, I thought that it would be a boring and dry history book. Fortunatly, it was not, hiroshima presented historical facts and information in a unique and enjoyable story. The straight forward approach that Hersey used in this book helped me to get into the story. he didn't make it long and drawn out, there was always something interesting going on. Overall, Hiroshima was a very good book that was both enjoyable and eductional. This book is worth reading again."
3,Eye-Opener,"John Hersey's Hiroshima is a very informative and eye-opening account of the dropping of first atomic bomb. It shows how six peoples lives are affected by the bomb. Hersey doesnt give his own opinions on whether or not the decision to drop the bomb was the right one; but clearly illustrates the atrocities caused by that decision. It gives insight as to what struggles the victims had to go through and the losses they faced. I liked the realism of the novel but was, at some points, too graphic. I also liked how the author gave an update at the end to follow up with each character. The book was sort of difficult to follow at the beginning because there are so many different names. Just take your time and refer to the back cover to refresh your memory of who's who. I hope you enjoy this book!"
1,not good book at all don't read it if you are unpatient,It was boring the subject should be more passinated writen than John Hersey did
2,A Boring Book.,"Ok, I had to read this book for school and it was boring. We was hearing the book from a tape and i kinda felt like going to sleep. My teacher said it's a hard book to read (maybe because it kinda reads like a newspaper) Read this book if you want to."
4,Hiroshima in my words,"I read ""Hiroshima"" as a class project and I totally loved it. I learned a lot about the Atomic bomb in Hiroshima and what the helpless survirors had to do to survive. It really interest me the way residence helped eachother as much as possible and tried to save as many pure lives as possible. I also became familiar with the Atomic bomb in Hiroshima, why, when, and how it happenend. John Hersey did a great job in this novel and I would like to compliment him on a job well done. I am very pleased I picked this book to read and not another one. I felt I got my money's worth, and this is a book I can always read over. I recommend this book to everyone, it's a must read."
4,"John Hersey's novel about the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan.","Hiroshima is the story of six survivors of the first use of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima, Japan. Through the story, the reader is thrown into the world of Japan on August 6, 1945. The most interesting part of the book is the story of Dr. Sasaki as he tries to help the people in the overrun hospital after his normally long shift. Although this is an interesting and informative analysis of the bombing, the book is definitely not for the weak of heart, as many parts of the book are extremely graphic."
4,My Review,"Hiroshima, by John Hershey, is a great reading experience. The tales of the six survivors of the A-Bomb weave an interesting and thrilling story of what nuclear warfare is like. The discriptions in the book are vivid and thought provoking, giving a graphic, yet accurate depiction of the bombing. I believed the book was an interesting aproach to the horrors of WWII."
3,Graphic detail.,"The times and trials of the people who survived the dropping of the bomb are vividly told in John Hersey's Hiroshima. The graphic detail, as told by the six eyewitnesses, really pulls you into Hiroshima, Japan, the day the bomb was dropped. It has amazing detail, and shows the horrors of the atomic bomb. If any person ever wants to know what the day to day life of the people in Hiroshima was before and after the dropping of the bomb, this is the book for you. On the other hand, if you just want to learn about the death and destruction of the atomic bomb dropped by the Americans, this book is very detailed. Although the book shows a lot of destruction and death, it is an easy and good read."
3,The crew of the ENOLA GAY didn't like this book.,"I'd known Paul Tibbets (pilot of the ""Silverplate"" B-29 ENOLA GAY and commander of the 509th CBG) for years while he was alive. I've also known Dutch Van Kirk, navigator of the ""Silverplate"" B-29 ENOLA GAY. This was one of the first WW2 military history (and aviation history) books I'd ever read, which happened to have been back in 1966, when I was 12. I'd never thought of it this way, but the men I knew in the 509th CBG always told me that they felt Hersey had portrayed them as militarists, rather than who they really were. Who they really were, were normal, patriotic Americans, doing whatever they could to help bring an end to all the pain and suffering of WW2."
3,Good bit of history.,The quality was good and the service was good too on the order. This was a gift for a cancer patient and she enjoyed it immensly. Thanks.
3,"A story of six lives before, during, and after the bomb.","One moment from the book that caught in my memory is what happens to Mr. Tanimoto when the bomb dropped. Mr. Tanimoto and a a friend were walking to a house to drop off perishables from their church and when they arrived the bomb was dropped. Mr. Tanimoto remembered that there was a flash of light across the sky and he threw himself between two large boulders in the garden. When he raised himself from the ground he saw that the house had collapsed with his friend inside of it. He was thankful that he hadn't dived into the entryway like his unfortunate friend. He walked away from the house thinking that the bomb must have dropped right on top of it because of the destruction caused. Hiroshima is an accurate story of the tales of six survivors but it is a completely dull read. It starts to be captivating, but when Hersey changes abruptly to another character it becomes confusing and tests your memory too much."
3,Hiroshima is great for anyone interested in World War II.,"One of the most compelling elements in John Hersey's Hiroshima is the great detail of the book. The descriptions make you feel as if you are there experiencing the horror of the bombing. Dr. Sasaki, a survivor of the bombing, works at a hospital and has to receive many people who suffered injuries during the days after the bombing. This is a moment that I will always remember, along with the five other stories of the survivors."
3,Not a bad book. Very interesting.,"While Hiroshima was interesting, it was not as exciting or suspenseful as a fictional story might be. It was, however, a compelling story that helped give a better view into what happened on the fateful day when Hiroshima was bombed, and it did hold my interest. While it was somewhat graphic, I was at times enthusiastic to get back and read more. It was a fascinating account of the bare truth. I would recommend it."
3,This book was great in informing me about what happened.,"It was a great book. It tells what actually happened on the day the bomb was dropped and it is told through the memories of six survivors. Some parts of the book were a little too vivid, but I like that part. Two thumbs up!"
5,A STORY THAT SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN,"I found this book to be very interesting and insightful. I had never read any books on the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan but had been curious about it for some time. This book answers some of the questions that I had and revealed things that I had no knowledge of. The book follows the lives of five people who were in Hiroshima at the time of the bomb dropping. It chronicles the people, places and horrors that they were witness to after the bomb had devasted there homes and lives in Hiroshima. The book was written shortly after these events took place so the stories and feelings that are related in the book are fresh and vivid. Not since Hiroshima and Nagasaki has mankind been subjected to such devastating destruction. This story should never be forgotten for fear of repeating this sad time in history."
2,required reading,"The book is great. Gives a unique view into Japanese survivors of the A-Bomb. However, this edition for what ever reason, does not include the Aftermath epilogue. I needed that chapter for my class and was very upset this book did not have it."
3,Very Good Message...But Boring!,"This book held a very strong message. In telling of the lives of six people that survived the bomb, we learn not only their stories, but we also feel a bit of the enormity of the disaster the bomb at Hiroshima caused. We learn that the effects of the atomic bomb didn't end a few days after it was dropped. It ended the lives of many, and changed those of all the citizens of Hiroshima.The fact is, however, that the book was very boring and confusing. It is necesary to read a chapter two or three times to take in everthing that happened. If you are willing overcome that aspect of the novel, then you should buy this novel without delay. I wasn't able to do so. That's why I gave it three stars."
1,Outdated,"What is this, the 1940's?Since it's publication there has been major additions made to the book which were not included in this publication."
2,Flavorless writing...,"We just had to read this story for my freshman english calss. I was of course pleased with how we didn't have to read some tale jumbled with so much symbolisim that we could barely remember the main charactor, but this was definately on the other end of the spectrum. I feel that this book was poorly written. The Atom Bomb is such a delicate subject, and it did not deserve the flavorless writing which was John Hersey's style. I often found myself bored because The words in the book were simply words, not passionate writing which I expected. I did give it two stars, because now I understood what the people of Hiroshima were going through, but the style of writing which was simply fact, left me bored."
3,Cancer Anyone?,"I can't begin to imagine the horror of it. The flash burns, some with flesh pulling off. Eyes hollowed out. Fires. Thirsty but barely able to open their mouths to take in water. Vomiting. No wonder it took the United States so long to help the Jews during the holocaust that claimed so many lives. They were too busy in their own version of the American holocaust against Japan.This book mentions a second atomic bomb that was dropped on Japan. This one not in Hiroshima. It does not detail that event. Just mere mention. I was not aware of a 2nd atomic bomb being detonated in Japan. Toward the end of the book, it accounts various bomb-test sites of both atom bombs and hydrogen bombs and the testing countries. Got to wonder how much of this radiation is in our drinking water and soil, none of which was contained at the test sites I'm sure as waters do flow to other sites.""Hiroshima"" follows the lives of a handful of people that survived the A-Bomb."
4,Great Missionary Story,"This is a great story about an interesting man. His other books are just as interesting (perhaps more so as this is sort of a bio, and they are stories) -- buy them all as you are able!"
3,"Dated, but still fun","This is a strange Bond book, in that James Bond doesn't even appear in the first half. Fleming focused on the USSR's spy service and on people who were known to work for it, which must have seemed very topical in the 1950s but today comes off as silly. Things pick up in the second half, though as with all Fleming's work, you have to learn to overlook the racism."
5,Love it,"From Russia With Love was written in 1957 and what was common knowledge back then may offend sensitive people today. Deal with it and keep on reading because this is going to be fun.All of Fleming's books were fast paced fun but Russia stands out among them. The characterizations are brilliant. The description of the vicious and dreadful woman, Rosa Klebb goes on for more than a page. By the time Flemming is finnished you KNOW this woman and you're afraid of her. Tatiana, the beautiful innocent caught in a web of lies, Kerim Bey, the tough half wild head of T branch and psychotic Irish giant, Red Grant are all beautifully brought to life. The Russian scenes are written with such tautness you'll wonder how anyone survived life in the Soviet Union with thier sanity in tact.If you're used to the Bond lite presented by Roger Moore' in his last two films or Pierce Brosnon's version, the Bond of the books will be a surprise. Enjoy!"
4,007 Revisited,"While it was fun to go back to the ""source "" material some of the insights etc are very dated. However it does offer a view into the cold war era from a different pointof view other than the USA's. Apprently our allies had a much different feel for their advesarial counterparts. To say the least, they definitely took a ""hands on"" approach."
4,"Good, but not perfect","So far all the reviews on this page have given this book 5 stars. I'm gonna have to break the streak and give four for a few reasons. I have read all of Raymond Bensons Bond books, and this was the first Fleming book I've read. I have to say that after all I've heard about Fleming I'm rather dissapointed. First of all, the first 100 pages were totally based on how they're gonna kill Bond. Come on! That could have been covered that in 10, and that would have been more than adequate. Second, of the Bond books I've read, this one has the least action. But, it had several strongpoints. Good character development, and it comes together in the last 50 pages. I suppose this is how Bond was meant to be. This book, despite its few weaknesses, is a must read for any Bond fan that wishes to see how Bond was meant to be. Oh, and I've just started on Doctor No. I'm 40 pages in and I'm hooked."
3,From Russia With Love,It was a disappointment after having seen the movie in the 1960's. It's not all that well written. It's unrealistic without the visual effects. And it ends with the poisoning of Bond.
4,From Russia with love,"Good book from so many years ago. Some things written then are not too PC for these days and would be chopped by the censors, I am sure. They called it like it was back then, too bad times have changed so much.Need more of the $1.99 specials and I would buy the whole set"
4,One of Ian Fleming's best,"I recently read three of the Bond novels and From Russia With Love was easily the best of the three; Fleming works in factual information about SMERSH (which actually existed) and the MGB (a KGB predeccesor), making this one of the least fantastic of the Bond novels. The character of Darko Kerim is great fun. And if you've seen the movie, and then read this book, you'll see why Robert Shaw was brilliantly cast as the sociopathic Grant."
4,One of the best Bond books!,"I don't like giving ""spoilers"" I'll give general comments, it's pretty similar to the film anyway though. I like how the first half of the book concentrates on Bond's enemies, The reader gets a real inside-look at the Russian side of espionage, the loyalty of Russian spies is quite remarkable as they really consider their homeland to be like their ""mother"" and appreciate everything the state has provided for them. I didn't mind at all that Bond was hardly mentioned for the first hundred pages, it made for a better build up when Bond must confront the villians. The espionage is this book is more deep and involving than in the other Bond Novels. If you're going to read a few Fleming novels, don't miss this one."
4,Super Reader,"This novel goes back to the world of super villain espionage. Bond's successes against SMERSH are starting to cause problems for the assassin organisation, and get them political heat from higher up. As a result, they plan to send a top guy to rid them of their 007 problem. Unfortunately for SMERSH, Bond gets a bit of help from Q-Branch.The Soviets try the beautiful double agent gambit again, but this one falls for his manly charms.The SMERSH agent finale is attempted murder on the Orient Express. No torture for Bond, but he ends up in a bad way."
4,Really,"The ending was rather disappointing bit bigger than that a very developed plot with quite a few hair raising, edge of your seat moments."
4,From Russia with Love.,"Very familiar with the Bond Film, the novel does not disappoint. Gives more insight into the characters and was an enjoyable read. I will download more from this author."
4,Great book,"As always, Flemings work is a fun adventure. A little far-fetched even for bond, but still fun. Would def recommend."
2,The Brendan Voyage,"This was one of several books recommend by my Irish tour guide. It was difficult, prodding reading. I hung in there and learned some things. Probably would be a good book for a sail boat fan and a very Irish guy."
5,well written,"I happen to like back stories and all the technical stuff. The author doesn't just write about the actual construction of the boat, he writes about the people who supplied him with the materials for construction and why those materials worked better than others might. Some nice descriptions of the people involved. Unforseens, like how bad grease covered cow hides smell. The learning curve of sailing this kind of vessel. In the beginning of my reading this book I found myself grumbling that the map near the front of the book didn't list a lot of locations. (I have a hardback copy that was published in 1978). I discovered that there are maps scattered through the book along with color photographs. One very unfortunate things was the tossing overboard of anything that the crew found unnecessary. 'Twas the times. I hope we've improved in our sensitivity."
4,More than Boats,"I almost put the book down while reading the first half, but stuck with it, and was rewarded in the second half. I wasn't interested in hearing about the cultures of the places where the boat crew came ashore. Actually, I wasn't interested in reading about anything but the ""voyage"" proper. And, in this book, you'll get info about the history of some of the places they landed and other ""side info"". As a result, I found the first half of the book slow and boring.Nonetheless, once they began the largest leg of the journey, and couldn't land anywhwere, the book picked up pace and held my interest. It turned out to be quite a voyage and a heck of a feat. In the end, I'm glad I read it. But, with that said, I'd have been disappointed had I paid full price for the book."
4,Recreation of a voyage from 500AD; Ireland to the N ew World,"A must read for any of Keltic blood, great detail about the materials and construction practices of the recreation of St.Brenden's ocean going leather boat.The courage and terror of sailing a square rigger open boat from Ireland to the New World, is thinly vailed, by the authors enthusiasm for his quest.Caught in the ice flows off New Foundland,in 0 degree water,one man hangs over the side with a stitch awl and thread,repairing the hull while the others man the pumps and tiller.This is a book to read curled up by a fire,you will praise God for home and harth."
2,sheds little red fibers,"It's ok.... warm enough. Not as soft as I was expecting, and it really sheds a lot. I washed it, hoping it would stop the shedding, but it just filled up my filter with lots of lint and it's still shedding. I would not buy this again."
5,Comfortable,"This blanket is the perfect size and I love the color. It's not too heavy and not too light. Perfect for the couch, bed, or a gift."
3,I like it but.....,The blanket sheds a lot and i have washed it three times... And it's still shedding. Other than that I like it!!!
1,Not worth a plug nickel,Terrible! I read the reviews and can't really understand why anyone would give this more than one star. It is a giant lint pad. I have washed and washed it to get as much lint out as I can and it still bleeds lint balls. It cannot be dried in the dryer according to the care instructions which makes it even more difficult to care for. I do not recommend this blanket
3,not what I expect.,"in the picture looks more puffy kind, it is very think like any other regular that you buy in local stores. the size is not big enought goes only 23 inch i=down the size of matrress."
4,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...zzzzzzzzzzz,"I love these blankets. They wear and wash well, don't shed and give such comfort. This color however is more of a rich rich red than burgundy. Still very lush and desirable."
1,Here's 1 secret I want you to know - don't waste your money,"I'm a sucker for learning the inside scoop from people who have really worked inside a particular field, so I bought this book. But if you have ever read a women's magazine about this subject or a newspaper article, or even listened to your mother, you won't read anything new. Just because I spent my money doesn't mean you have to."
1,Rip Off,"G.K. Chesterton, not this rip-off writer, wrote the detective story ""The Eye of Apollo.""Not that anyone would buy this anyway (casualty of the hyper-free-market that it is available at all),but I wanted to warn any who might.Merci,Me."
1,Why bother?,"Was not expecting this stuff to work miracles, and I was not disappointed. Any scratch that can be seen with the naked eye, from thread-fine swirls to paint-scuffing oh my gosh scabs, is impervious to this product. You're better served buying scratch-off lottery tickets to gamble on paying for a repaint of the damaged panel. If you just like to rub on your car regardless of the end results, this is the product for you. Vaseline couldnt do any worse. At least that has multiple uses."
2,"Didn't work for me, but might for you","This did not work for my needs. I had some tree sap on my car and used the soft side of a scrub brush to remove. Well needless to say that left fine scratches in the clear coat. I tried a 2 foot by 2 foot practice area, no luck. It may work for other scratches but was no help to me. Still love Mothers Stage 1 Polish and Stage 2 wax treatments.I meant to give 1 star but accidentally hit 2 and could not change."
3,No too efective,"I bought this to remove some scratches from my wife car, and the result was marginal."
3,For the Kindle Edition,"The Book of Wonder contains a bunch of prettily written yet dull stories about non-sympathetic characters. There. I said it. However, it seems to be a classic that is quite loved by some people, so I'll just keep the rest of my opinion to myself. Well, and maybe they are meant to be ironic, which excuses some issues.As for the kindle version of this book, it lacks both illustrations and an active table of contents. It contains the following stories:The Bride of the Man-HorseDistressing Tale of Thangobrind the JewellerThe House of the SphinxProbable Adventure of the Three Literary MenThe Injudicious Prayers of Pombo the IdolaterThe Look of BombasharnaMiss Cubbidge and the Dragon of RomanceThe Quest of the Queen's TearsThe Hoard of the GibbelinsHow Nuth Would Have Practised His Art Upon the GnolesHow One Came, As Was Foretold, to the City of NeverThe Coronation of Mr. Thomas ShapChu-By and SheemishThe Wonderful WindowEpilogue"
3,"For all practical purposes, this is only half of the book","This is the fifth collection of ironic yet gorgeous tales to be published by Lord Dunsany. Like its four predecessors, it was accompanied by equally splendid illustrations by Sidney Sime. Sime's illustrations add to each of the books in which they appear. In this book, however, where the illustrations came first and inspired most of the fourteen stories, their omission is more than a mere inconvenience. The tales remain enjoyable - as the products of early Dunsany, how could they not be? - but this edition deprives the reader of participation in the playful interaction between prose and image intended by its creators."
5,I love it!,"Corn Pops, one of Kellogg's troika of cereals that Moms hate but kids love! (The other two of the troika are Froot Loops and Apple Jacks.)What's there not to love about Corn Pops? They're sweet and crunchy and corn flavored, it's almost like pop corn, in fact I sometimes eat this without the milk like a snack. Moms hate them because of the sugar but a serving size (1 cup) only gives you 14g of sugar vs. 39g in a 12oz can of Coke, and fruit juices all have sugar so you can't really get away from it. And it does contain quite a bit of vitamins and minerals.This individual pack is very handy. You can carry it anywhere with you and all you need is a small carton of milk to make it a meal or a snack. And this individual pack prevents you from overeating it (unless you decide to eat 2-3 of them at once.)So:Pros: Tastes great. Corn pop flavor. Handy size. Convenient on the go. Snack without the milk.Cons: Moms don't like them."

4,Just Listen,"All of the interviews were interesting to any fan of The Doors. Jim Morrison is a very intriguing person who was misunderstood by many. Ray is very intelligent along with the other members; and as for Robby and John, well I this interview adds to the very little knowledge that I have about them. I recommend this disk to any and every fan of The Doors. They are all GREAT musicians and I applaud the surviving Doors for continuing with their music. Music is a DOORway to another realm.(I think so anyway) KG:o}"
4,Fine Power Pop Album,"One of the world's truly great singers delivers a bold, energetic and unashamedly pop album. The renewed interest in 80s music should bring new attention to this fine effort, being on the cusp of the 90s. I played this album to death on its release and was quite disappointed with the mellow Adult Oriented Rock turn in subsequent releases. Sure, the power ballad allows Arena to showcase her voice (and what a voice it is!), but the songs lack the fire and energy of this first CD.It is a matter of musical taste of course, and it's unlikely this album will appeal to the grandparents toward whom the later albums were aimed. But if you prefer explosive rock to the slow sizzle of a torch song, this is an album you can never play loud enough! Her subsequent albums are fine, but not as much to my taste as Strong As Steel. I wish she's made a few more like this one."
3,The Weakest Link,"Tina Arena's debut shows very little of the woman's incredible talent. While she sings of things most likely beyond her comprehension when this album was put out, she also shows that everyone has to start somewhere.""Strong As Steel"" is an album that can be viewed many different ways. Tina has some things on here that ARE enjoyable, such as ""Woman's Work"" and ""Be A Man,"" but for the most part, her voice is underdeveloped and her music is lacking both lyrically and melodically.Her long-awaited sophomore CD, Don't Ask, and most recent ""In Deep"" show off her true skill as a songstress- and why she's Australia's #1 female singer!"
3,Tina's first album......,"....isn't really that bad. Allthough I must say that she has become better from album to album. The album contains a #2 Hit single ""Strong as Steel"" but she just doesn't sing the way she really could. (at least on this album.) People are used to her ""new"" style and so don't really appreciate this album. Actually a pitty...."
1,Horrible!,This album features one of the worst performers around. Weak voice singing poorly writen songs. Get another album. ANY other album.
5,good read,this is a good read but start with the first book in this series and youll be hooked. this is one in a series following different generations.
5,There's a TRACE left on my mind,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down. Even snuck into the ladies room at work to read a few chapters....This book was both entertaining and arousing (have you read any of Carly Phillips books?)to a great degree. I'm not a huge reader of romance novels but i've tracked down the 2nd/3rd books in the series and i hope i'm not disappointed. The only thing i didn't like was where the chapter would be going along with a few characters and then jump into another ""scene"" or dialog without acknowledging the transition. BUT it didn't stop me from turning the pages...."
4,Another great book in the series,I love to read books that are part of a series and J Johnston is great at it. The Cowboy has the typical macho characters you love to hate and twists and turns that keep you reading.
4,"Bridging the ""feuding"" Gap?","I picked up this book because of the positive reviews and the fact that it was on the NYT bestseller list. It is a well-written story, though I think the plot is a tad bit melodramatic. I did like the overall storyline of Trace and Callie coming from feuding families, yet managing to fall in love -- and attempt to overcome obstacles. I liked Trace's character better than Callie's. He seemed more mature and ready to forgive. I tried to put myself in Callie's place and see the family and intimate relationships through her eyes, but even then I thought she was a bit indecisive with her emotions. And, I felt the ending a bit rushed, particularly the murder scheme and the who and why of it all. It's plausible, but I would have liked to see that part developed better.I will probably read the next book in the series to see how (and if) the family feud continues. Or, if the gap will finally be bridged as families blend?"
3,Cowbow..,"I am really injoying this book. However, i have found a big discrepancy. I remember when i read Frontier Woman, Creighton Creed had 2 daughters, in Cowboy, it says she had raised 4 sons!This was a disappointment to me to think i was continuing to follow a family,only to discover it had been changed to in order to write Cowboy...Did i miss something?"
2,not romance,"I was very disappointed in Joan Johnston's 'The Cowboy, besides being too filled with uninteresting ranch and horse information, the characters were not captivating. I had to put it down as I began chapter four. I did not care if the hero or heroine got together or not. I was soured that for one there was 15 years between their loving one another, breaking up and finding each other again, the secret of their child and the fact that she had married and produced another child with her husband took all the 'romance' out of it for me right from the start. Joan has done much better before this one."
1,I didn't like the heroine!,I could not figure out what motivated the heroine in this story! The guy is perfect and she is so incredibly stupid! I actually could not finish this book. I found it to be a complete waste of time.
1,Utterly disappointing,"Sorry to say that I don't think any of the characters were convincing..though there was something of a plot, the main players were not at all credible. Not much of a read."
5,Wonderfully Exciting!,"Wow! What can't I say about this book? The characters and plot swept me away from the very beginning and didn't let me go until I had finished. Since I have a hectic schedule there isn't much time for reading, but I made time for this one. I turned each page with joyful anticipation. I have been longing for a good Texas romance for such a long time. I related to the main character Callie. Way to go Ms. Johnston. This book is a definite winner. The story line screams sequel and/or movie. I am going to recommend this book to all of my friends and family."
5,Cute book,"This was the first book by Joan Johnston I've read. I was not dissapointed! I usually only read historicals, but I've read this twice so far. Trace. Who could deny a character like Trace anything? Poor Callie. She had so much going on in her life.. until Trace helped find a way for her to cope with everything. I would recomend this book to anybody to read. It was a great read."
2,"Unless you are totally bored, don't read this.","The subject is a good idea and so is the plot, but the way it is written is slow and frustrating. The characters are unrealistic and cliche-ish. I can see that maybe a few people would like it, but if you want to be able to sit down and lose yourself in a book, I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,low brow racist biggot rantings,I am a Chicano and I am insulted by this garbage. It is not what we Mexican American really believe. The author must not be very educated. He is clearly a biggot. Is he really a professor?
5,"Night, bunny","Little Rabbit cuddles with his dad at bedtime, reviewing, in simple rhyming verse, all the things they did today. From housework to reading to playing with friends, Rabbit's day was a pleasant one indeed. Dropping off to sleep with happy thoughts is always a good thing. Perhaps the best feature of Rabbit's Bedtime is the artful illustrations, formed of basic shapes in construction paper colors. This is a lovely little story to read to under-three's, or to serve as an early reader for somewhat older kids."
1,No way!,"The title of this DVD is the real OC Uncensored, and yet, the damn thing was censored. Made no sense to me. There was maybe 45 total seconds of breast nudity, which, nudity is probably the main reason people buy something like this. I will never watch this DVD again, total waste of money. If you're looking for real girls naked, stick with Girls Gone Wild."
1,Running empty...,"Quite a disappointing work from Andy Kessler. Yes, he succesfully ran a long-only fund and made a bunch of money for his investors and himself, but please don't confuse the luck with the talent - anyone who happened to buy a dot-com stock in 1996 and happened to sell in the early 2000 would have achieved similar or better return on investment (this is not to say that he's not a talented investor, it's just his track record doesn't prove much). As far as his new economic theory - i.e., ""it's really different this time"" - it's a bit naive and superficial. I found a bit annoying the fact that he belittles other hedge funds, companies and investors in Silicon Valley, and even some of his own clients!"
2,"A very disappointing read, kind of boring","This book is a real letdown. As other reviewers noted, he wasn't running a typical hedge fund strategy. He just bought and held tech companies, either public or private. And he did this during the .com boom. He had the sense to wind down the fund before the crash. Gosh, he made a lot of money. As I think he himself says, never mistake talent for a Bull market.You don't find out much of anything about his approach, because I don't think there was much too it.The chapters jump around without much coherence. He seems to be building up to a point, leading to a big 11 page section that entirely in italics, in case you were going to miss it. We have higher margins than the developing world, so the trade deficit doesn't matter. That's it.One of the least interesting books I've read this year."
2,Unstructured drivel,An uninspiring collection of anecdotes for the most part. A series of forgettable recollections. Stick to the classics before you reach for this.
3,Depressing,"Yeah, it's reality. But I'm sort of a documentary junky and this one was just depressing. I feel sorry for the guy and his family. Yes, I'm a drummer (though no fan of Varone's) and used to have ""the dream"", but there's really not a lot to say positive about this video. I own it now, but I doubt I'd watch it again. Ever. <shrug>"
2,Monte Grande,"This is an amazing movie, but buy a hard copy, rather than an online version as subtitles are not available and the movie (while mostly in English) has interview with people in Spanish, French and German."
1,Buy a book,"This video is about Varela's life, not about his work. Spend the money and time reading his work instead of this."
1,I seasoned this wok over 20 times,"I seasoned this wok over 20 times per the instructions some reviewers left here and per the instructions that came from wok shop. It is still bleeding black on a tissue. I then decided to SCRUB the heck out of it with soap and water and reseasoned, over and over and over. the black never stopped coming off. period."
5,"Great wok, definitely not a Lodge Wok (thank goodness!!!)","There are a lot of really bad woks out there but this wok is great!!! This thin cast iron wok is made as a cast iron wok should be made. The heavy woks made by Lodge and other western manufacturers are much too thick to use properly. Stir frying is very fast and requires rapid temperature changes. A heavy cast iron wok cannot cool down rapidly when you turn down the flame and it takes forever to heat up. You might as well be trying to cook with a wok on an electric stove. You heat your wok to one temperature in a heavy cast iron wok and your are stuck with it for awhile. I've used both and this is far superior.If you want more info on wok cooking read ""The Key to Chinese Cooking"" and ""The Breath of a Wok"" and the really wonderful cooking blog ""Tigers and Strawberries."""
1,Terrible Customer Service!!,"Worst customer service I have experienced ever. It arrived very late, and I requested to cancel the order three days before they even shipped it. Don't purchase here, there are many better woks out there too. I wish I could give this a negative review."
2,Poor....a definition.,"There is a translation problem at the fundamental level...this product might be of ""traditional"" style, yet there may be some essential differences in construction from historical makeup, that cause it to be rather, shall we say, flimsy; poorly finished at that.....plus I do not think traditional means made with a plasticized handle cover. I spent as much sending it back to the vendor as it cost.....even via the cheapest method possible.....it was a waste of time and effort to have ever considered this wok as an addition to my tools of the kitchen."
4,Terrific,"I suppose it was a bit of a chore to clean & season, but it really takes heat well & cooks beautifully. Now after a few months it has a great patina & doesn't stick. One drawback is that it is a little heavy & can be cumbersome, particularly when you have the flame blasting... wish it had a long handle instead of the two small handles. Still, it's a hell of a pan for the price."
4,Goi for a Great Wok,This is a great wok that comes with detailed instructions for breaking it in and cautions against using soap in later cleanings to avoid losing the patina.I've cooked several meals using the wok and the ring on my electric stove and found that it works great. My only warning is that it noes not come with a matching top. I had to buy an aluminum cover that spoils the elegance of the cook's view.So maybe traditional Chinese do not use a cover? I don't know.
5,Love it,I absolutely love this wok! It has quickly become my favorite kitchen tool to cook with....so versatile and easy. Seasoning it was not difficult...just follow the directions.....it will give it a wonderful nonstick finish. I highly recommend this wok.
4,"Cast Iron Wok, good value","This wok was easy to season and works well. It is thinner than I was expecting a cast iron wok to be, but I have never had one before, so all I could compare it to is my Lodge cast iron pan. It heats up quickly and cooks well. It is not completely seasoned in yet, but so far it is not sticky and cleans up quickly."
3,"Good, but a repeat","I didn't realize that this book would overlap several others I had already bought , so that was a bit of a disappointment. Other than that, same great Sherman's Lagoon material!"
2,Four PLUGS not Four PAIRS,"For $16, I assumed that these were four pairs. You know, the way that every other plug manufacturer displays the number of plugs. Will not be using this manufacturer again."
3,"Good quality, but beware of quantity","These appear to be good quality banana plugs but beware and read carefully. It's packages as a ""set of 4"" meaning 4 plugs, not 4 sets of 2 plugs. So in the end it's only enough to connect two sets of wiring. My fault for not reading as carefully as I should, but don't want you to make the same mistake. My goal is to find quality banana plugs for under $4 a pair."
3,You get what you pay for.,"We were looking for a tent for our three girls (1,2,3) at an affordable price. They love the tent. However, it has already ripped in one spot. Our girls are not crazy kids, so, if you're interested in sturdy, keep looking."
2,Love the bag but the hardware is lousy,"I love this bag for its storage, lightness and look. The straps sit well on my shoulder and it is very comfortable to carry. I have been using it for LESS THAN a month (got it for Christmas) and today when I went to pick it up - the metal buckle that holds the handle to the bag snapped. I don't carry anything but a laptop and my ipad in it so I know i did not over load the bag. Seriously disappointed."
3,"Deep and relealing, a true insight.","Hopes betrayed is an exceptionally well researched and insightful book. The author goes into detail, and confirms previously unspoken truths about Keynes early life. It pays particular attention to Keynes homosexuality, such as his long held affections for Duncan Grant, and also his relationships, coiteries, and philosophies. Personally I found the chapters deailing Keynes' influence in the war most interesting.Although the book goes into ample detail, it is a little dry, and possibly lacks a little life. One sometimes feels as if there are a few too many quotes, names and places. This somewhat detracts from the interest of the book.However, overall anyone who is curious as to what made father of modern economics ought to read this book."
1,Rusted through in two yrs,This line is garbage it rusted through by the back tire in 2yrs here in Chicago
4,Pretty Good Mount,"This is a good mount for the price and for home. It's smaller than I expected (which is okay) but because of that getting the mic in and out can be, if not difficult, not super easy. After awhile the felt on the inside is starting to come away so now I just leave the mic in. Still, you can pay a whole lot more for a shock mount so if you're on a budget, this one will work just fine."
1,Broke after a few months,"The twist tightener broke after a few months of use. When I tried to tighten it, it wouldn't get tight at all. The mic would just slope down and so it was unusable. The Samson pop filter I had was much better quality. It's not the quality I would expect for audio equipment."
3,Pretty tight fit with an AT2020,"I purchased this shock mount to be used with an Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB Microphone. This microphone fits very, very snugly into the shock mount -- almost too tightly. The mic stays secure and the shock mount works fine, but if I had to do it over again I'd probably buy theSamson SP01 Shockmount Spider Mount for Condenser Micsfor a better overall fit."
1,Avoid,Build quality is utter garbage.I bought three of these things to use in three different locations.One broke on arrival. One broke after two weeks of use. The last one just broke after two months of infrequent use.Have replaced all of them with (a much more expensive) shock mounts from audio technica
3,Get What You Pay For,"I purchased this to go with my Audio Technica Condensor Mic. I believe the mic may be just a bit too fat, because it barely can hold it. The issue is the spring clips that you squeeze to open the body and slide the mic in. The springs themselves are just held into place by the retention of the spring itself - the outer ends slip in two small opening and just sort of stick there. No screws, clamps, adhesives...nothing.Mine pop off occasionally....not all at the same time thank god, but I will notice one is popped out and I have to bend it back into place with some pliars.So, if this breaks down completely, I'll be getting a shock mount from Audio Technica. If it doesn't break...then it will still be more trouble than it was worth."
3,"thin, flimsy costume, but cute","My son loves doggies and clifford. Overall, we like the costume. But the legs and arms are narrrow/slim so it would be difficult to add another layer of clothing underneath. It's usually cold here during trick-or-treating so I'm gald we ordered a size larger to accomodate another layer. My son is three and even a little small for his age, but I ordered the kids small, instead of the toddler size. Also the hood/clifford's head is floppy and won't stay up, so I will have to modify it with wire to stay upright. So i'll have to do a little work to make the costume right, but my son still loves it."
3,runs small,"I ordered the size 4-6 for my average sized 4 yr old daughter, but on the bag it came in said ""Size 4-6 for a 3-4 year old"". Makes no sense why costume sizes are different than regular clothes sizes. So it's too small and tight for her, but she squeezed into it anyway and she still had a lot of fun pretending to be a puppy. It's cheap material with loose strings everywhere and the head piece was bent down the middle, so doesn't look nice. I guess you get what you pay for. Wish they had a bigger size."
4,2002 Liberty Sport Install,"When I first tried to install the hitch, I thought the bolts were the wrong size too. I tried to get a bolt started in each of the holes, no luck. I was going to run out and get some different bolts as the other reviewer mentioned, but I stopped at the Jeep dealer first and they confirmed they were the correct size. They told me to get a tap and clean up the threads. Lots of rust and mud in there from being open over the years. The tap started easily, but got a little rough about a 1/4 inch up. After that, the install took 15 minutes by myslef. Looks great, hides well. My only concern is the clearance between the spare tire and the ball when installed. May have to flip my hitch over when I actually try to hook up the boat.4 stars only (well, 4 1/2) because it didn't come with a hitch cover....really? Had to go get one. Cost $3.If you got rust like I did, you will need this to clean the threads up:Century Drill and Tool 97319 Hexagon Metric Tap, 12.0 x 1.25"
5,Tattoos and tears,"Joolz is like a good friend who tells you secrets, who comforts you when you are down, who cares, and looks, and listens. The only thing you regret when reading this book is not being able to actually call her and talk. The stories of young people looking for identity in a cold and hostile world, told in that special poetic Joolz' way are as always touching and beautiful. This is modern poetry, with strong tribal roots. If you were a teenager in the Eighties and hated it...I recommend anything else by Joolz and music by her friends ""New Model Army"" and ""Red Sky Coven""."
4,Nice Hat,Good looking hat. It cuts the sun when I am in the Garden. I saved the box so that I can save it for next summer. It has an elastic band inside so that it fits most head sizes.
2,"OK, not great.","Some interesting thoughts on aikido, but very thin for expensive price. Last half of book is nothing but photos. Save yourself some money. Buy it used or wait for the paperback."
5,Not your run-of-the-mill fictional chartacters,"Often I get tired of the perfect hero and the divine heroine. Kristin Hannah's characters come alive because they are so flawed, fragile and fascinating! This wonderful book grabbed my attention from the first chapter when Selena attempts suicide and all the quirky turn of events leading up to the final chapter. The book slowed down somewhat in the middle, but continue reading because the pace picks up again and keeps you engrossed to the final page. Selenas battered soul comes alive when she falls in love with Ian, the physician who saves her....but, he has demons of the heart he has to struggle with before learning from her what love is. Their fight for love is so intense and heartfelt you'll feel that no two people ever loved more deeply then Selena & Ian."
3,Good Plot - Cheesy Writing,"After reading ""Magic Hour"" I ran out and bought every book by Kristin Hannah at the used bookstore I could lay my hands on. I absolutely loved ""Magic Hour"". However, ""Waiting for the Moon"" was a bit of a disappointment - it was obviously written when the author was younger and less experienced as a writer. The plot was good - a great premise for a story, I thought - but the writing itself shouted ""novice"" and the dialogue was cheesy and quite unbelievable in parts. The characters have a hard time staying ""in character"", but I was willing to overlook what I consider a blatant flaw because the story itself was so engaging."
3,Slow to develop,"This book reminded me of Judith McNaught's ""Until You"", with the anmesia theme, just not as good. I just didn't feel for the characters. The baby talk with Serena got on my nerves. I guess you just need to be in the mood for this kind of story."
4,Love Hannah books.,I love Kristin Hannah books. This one was set in a time when not alot was known about medicine and people where put in institutions when they didn't know what was really wrong with them. Hannah connects medicine with family and comes up with a good book.
5,Wonderful!,The time period of this book was so different than the other Kristin Hannah books I have read but she did not disappoint with capturing the readers attention. Great!
2,unrealistic,"How could someone with all of the extreme head and facial damage described in this book--heal up to be so incredibly beautiful, especially back in the 1800s when medical care was not what it is today? I found this to be unbelievable."
3,Good Story - Hard to get into,"I had a hard time getting into this book. Even when I was half way through with it, I still had trouble keeping on. I kept trudging through it because once I spend any amount of time reading a book, I have to finish it no matter how painful it is.It was very slow, but I just kept believing that the ending would make it worth the effort. And, it pretty much was. It was just really hard to see the forest for the trees."
3,Waiting for the Moon,This was not as good a read as many of Kristin Hannah's other books that I have read. I felt that the story line was somewhat unbelievable and did not feel like real life to me. The characters were not real to me.
5,"What a beautiful, unusual romance","This book took me on a ride. I thought I had bought a generic romance book (I fell for the cover, which is really pretty), read the blurb on the back, thought: sounds nice. Now I have read it, I know I have really found a keeper.Very well fleshed out characters, both the hero and heroine are adorable. They have both had hard times (talking about an understatement there), and find love in a very unusual circumstance. Yes, I love this book, and this gem has its place on my shelves for sure."
2,it was ok,"Not one of my favorite Kristin Hannah books, I love most of her writing but this one not her best effort"
5,Very positive and groovy tunes.,This artist makes me very happy. Their music is very uplifting and positive. They are very good at this and I know Im a fan for life. Such a great jam band! I highly suggest this and ALL their albums.
2,Needs a lot of improvement.,"Althought this is the first in her Kate Fansler series, it is the second that I have read. If I had read this book first, I probably would not be inclined to continue with this series. I felt like I was just dropped into the middle of a cast of characters without being properly introduced to them and what their roles are (history, etc.). The one thing that seems to be consistent is Cross' habit of long sentences infused with prepositional phrases and lots of words like however, therefore, etc. I realize the protagonist is an English professor, and I don't have any problem understanding the sentences, but I find myself getting impatient having to wade through all that excess just to get to the point of a sentence. (Luckily the only time the reader has to deal with that is when Kate is talking.) At this point, I have to say this series is not a high priority on my reading list."
5,A little corner of Heaven,That is what this place is like & that is how the author captures the atmosphere of this beautiful place.
2,Unfullfilling,"Thank goodness Jillian Becker was there for Sylvia Plath the last days of her life--because it appears nobody else was. Becker was a true friend and I appreciate that.But...""Giving Up"" really had no substance or depth. I was wondering why Becker wrote a book about her experience with Plath-rather than a short essay or college paper. This would have been quite acceptable--but paying $14.95 for a book that makes Plath out to be the victim of her adulteress husband is absurd and shallow. Plath was far from shallow and had her demons long before Ted Hughes entered in.""Giving Up"" is only 73 pages--and I am thankful for that. Although some parts were interesting, a short essay would have been sufficient and way enough information for one to handle."
5,A GOOD LOOK AT A NICE GUY,I REALLY ENJOYED READING THIS. MARCUS DOES A GOOD JOB DESCRIBING HIS CAREER WITH THE RAIDERS AND CHIEFS. HIS CRITICISM OF AL DAVIS AND RAIDER ORGANIZATION IS EXTREMELY INTRIGUING. ALSO INTERESTING IS HIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE OJ MURDER TRIAL AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH OJ AND HIS WIFE. THIS IS WELL WORTH YOUR TIME.A MUST READ.
4,"Valuable, Dangerous, Incomplete, Buy It","The bottom line on this little book is that it merits buying and throwing in your suitcase if you are the kind of person that needs to do your own research from the road. In a nutshell, it is: 1) valuable because it brings together in one place a very easy to read and use guide to a wide range of Internet-based resources; 2) dangerous because it may tempt business managers to do their own research from a hotel room rather than rely on real information professionals; 3) incomplete in many ways--two obvious ones are its neglect of the meta-search engines such as Compernic and its oversights of the Burwell Worldwide Directory of Information Brokers; and 4) worth buying as a light-weight (double entrendre intended) reference. I like it, it is worth the price and still relevant today."
2,False sense of security,"I bought this product with good intentions more as a preventative measure. In the many years I have lived at my house, I've only seen a bug on occasion. (Our house is sprayed monthly by a pest control company.) However, I saw a bug this morning and I no longer have my false sense of security. The bug was in the same room as the device. So, I feel I wasted my money."
2,Not sure it helped,Bought 4 of these for a remote cabin that does not get used every weekend to help keep the rodents away. Sadly it has not worked. The mice still come in and eat the rat poison trays. Wish it did work.
1,don't waste your money,The mice and ants sit around and laugh at you. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Fails in its attempt to be funny and smart.,"This might be a funny book to 10-year-olds, or to people who haven't noticed that movie stars can't hwlp but open their mouths and sy something politically irrelevant and ill-thought out whenever there's a microphone around, or to someone who hasn't lived and worked in politics on the left coast, and knows too much to sleep well at night.The bulleted points about ""You might be a closet conservative if you..."" some 15 pages in was as far as I could manage. During those 15 pages, I found not one supportable fact. You get the feeling reading the book that the guy just sat down & wrote it one night.We already know most Hollywood & liberal types barely got out of high school, few went to college and I'd bet there isn't a single one of them who majored in public policy or administration. (Al Gore got a D and C+ in his two college science courses.)If you're looking for a book that'll make you think, keep looking."
4,Important,"I read Hirsen's book while a teacher in West LA who lived with an angry, left wing, out of work actor. Say what you want about some of the dull parts and cheap shots, this book needed to be written, and Hirsen is a vital man in Hollywood for doing so. These people are not only mostly ignorant schmucks, but arrogant and preachy at the same time. Good combination? They live wonderful lives of privilege, but find time to castigate America and capitalism at every turn, voting for the party of failure and demeaning those (policemen, military) whose yearly salaries are less than one pair of their shoes. They are the WORST of civilization, and any negative attention---rather than fawning and jealousy---is welcome."
3,Sadly Disappointed,"I really thought I'd love this book, but I was disappointed. I agree with Hirsen's general ideas and love reading him on NewsMax, but this book is a bit slipshod and he's not very funny. I'm afraid Dr. Hirsen just isn't that great a writer. And the material has such potential - he could have really lampooned these people and made it entertaining, but instead it sounds like he just knocked out a first draft and they went ahead and published it ""as is."" Some creative research and more critical thinking could have made this a killer but alas, it's not. Also has some dumb errors, like misspelling the venerable PR Firm Rogers and Cowan as Rogers and Kowan! Just disappointing."
1,Shamelss Opportunism,"Oh what a hack. It used to be that people of this sort made their living in the alleys near adult bookstores. While some of us are clothed in useful ideas and the ability to aspire to higher things, this author is clothed in thigh high white boots and a micro mini. This is a ""Hello Sailor"" kind of book.The fact that books like this gain any kind of an audience is endemic of the cultural decline of a once great nation. Like willing sheep the populace follow their various Judas Goats into one killing yard after another. If you are too stupid to divine otherwise, you deserve what you get in the end. Enjoy the ride, it's all downhill from here."
2,Pretty Weak Effort,"I'm a conservative blogger who LOVES to laugh at liberal celebrities, but there's not much meat here. Hirsen's book feels pretty slapdash and disjointed; the writing is nothing special, and the stories have been told with more flair elsewhere. I wanted to like it...it's just not very good."
2,Many better books out there,"I'm a big fan of many conservative political books, and found this one lacking in both readability and humor. I recommend instead any Ann Coulter book or especially ""Useful Idiots"""
3,Funny,"To look at this book in a non partisan way, it's funny. I, as a liberal was even laughing at the sarcasm. Hirsen is like the Al Franken or Michael Moore for converatives.Hirsen also has some hypocrisy. He bashes celebrities for speaken against President Bush, all well Hirsen speaks badly against Clinton. He also bashes People like Franken and Moore for doing what he does. My real question is when will the ""Tales from the Right coast"" come out and will it be the size of a childrens' book?"
1,Many better ways to spend your time and money,"I received this book as a birthday gift. As someone of the conservative persuasion on a great number of issues, I expected to have a rollicking good time with this one. WRONG!!! I found the book to be very poorly written and despite the wealth of potential available material out there I found myself constantly losing interest. Makes me wonder how something this bad ever gets published. Be you of the liberal or conservative stripe spend your time on something more substantial. A big thumbs down!!"
1,This book was horrid.,"I was given this book by a friend. I can only assume they thought it would amuse me. I have never read such poor writing ever. Run-on sentences, misused words, incorrect punctuation...to name a few. Did anyone with a high school diploma edit this book? The premise is also somewhat amusing considering Californians are clamoring for a Terminator as Republican run at the Governorship. I can only hope this review helps one person not read this abomination. I would suggest reading the Enquirer before this book."
2,Pass it up.,"This book simultaneously talks down to the reader, while assuming he/she is very knowledgabe in international affairs and recent history. It is a compilation of brief vignettes and anecdotes loosely tied into 293 pages. Don't waste your time. Read one of Ann Coulter's books instead, you'l get more out of it and enjoy it more."
3,Unique and not for everyone,"Excel Saga is the most spaztic anime I have ever seen. You just can't watch more than 3 episodes in a row. It has a unique take, showing a similar story line in various ways (i.e. action, chic flick, drama, etc.). ""Very unique"" would sum it up."
4,"Weird, Weird Weird....","Like the title suggest, this was a quack experiment. This was as weird as it gets as it makes fun of several other animes out there. Totally random..and mind numbing if you don't find stupid sitaution funny. By stupid, I mean really really stupid. I enjoyed the anime but I wouldn't recommend this if you don't find those situation funny."
1,An interesting book....,"I had to take a class in college and everything was based on this book. I thought that the book was totally pointless. Some of the sentences were so long that by the time I finished reading it, I forgot what it was about. The chapters also all linked together and so if you missed a page, you were lost. I also think that the information was also very difficult to understand. The sentences were all jumbled together and I thought that anyone could write a book of this level. I understand that the topic of social research is a difficult thing, but this book seemed to only make it worse."
5,My Son's Favorite Book,"This is my 3 year old son's favorite book. The pictures are wonderful, and the story is really cute. It made my son want to be a ""good knight"" for Halloween, and today he took the book in to school to read to the class. He LOVES it! It's a great book for all ages."
5,Steve Gregg is my hero.,"Steve Gregg is the most humble, down to earth man alive. I am honored to have met such a great Christian man. This book is a must for those trying to understand the book of Revelation. If any are interested in what the bible teaches on a variety of subjects, check out his website for free lectures and MP3's. www.thenarrowpath.comEverything there is free, unlike other ""Christian"" websites who charge for everything."
3,GOOD BUT NOT COMPLETE,"This book brings together 4 views on understanding the apocalypse.My only criticism is that it tends to have ignored other viewpoints,rather than going for completeness.The late date preterist view is mentioned only in passing,and the amount of space devoted to the views of the early church fathers ,should have been expanded on.It does an admirable job of bringing together in one handy reference the views of evangelicals.But if you are interested in the in depth viewpoints of older christian denominations ,such as Lutheran,Catholic and Orthodox you will be disappointed."
4,Awesome Book,"This is an Awesome book and well written. If you haven't completed much research into Revelation then this book will help you keep an open mind, if you have done study on Revelation and are looking deeper into different views then this book is a great overview of the 4 main views."
4,Too Unbelievable Not To Read,"This book, and story, is too amazing, too unbelievable, to be true. And, yet, it is.This is the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., a high school dropout who became 1.) a pilot for Pan-Am; 2.) a pediatric specialist in Atlanta and resident supervisor of a pediatric unit; 3.) a lawyer with the state's attorney's office; and, 4.) a sociology professor at a Utah college--all before the age of 20!Frank was the smoothest of con men. It is unbelievable how he faked an FAA license; a law degree from Harvard and enough bad checks to keep him in permanent retirement.If Frank's jetsetting life-style is too much to believe, then you will have a great time reading of his jail escapes by 1.) fishing himself down an airplane toilet and 2.) just simply walking out of prison after convincing guards he was undercover.This story is just to unbelievable not to read! A fascinating look at how easy a life of crime could be."
3,Unbelievable!,"After enjoying this movie on cable, I got the book and read it in a day or so. Captivating and unbelievable...so unbelievable that I began to think, ""Why should I believe anything this guy says...or writes?"" Well, there is no doubt he stole a lot of money and did a lot of running and went to prison, but I suspect there must be a lot of self-serving enhancement of the tales told. If he was as big a con man as he claims, there's no way for that to have converted to absolute honesty in such a short time. Enjoy the book, but just don't read it looking for any money-making ideas."
4,An entertaining read,I liked this - I've not read a book in a few months and wanted to find something light - I actually first seen this book in a supermarket while waiting for my girlfriend to finish elsewhere... It caught my attention and it was a must read... I think if I were to read books more often I would perhaps have been less excited about it (though still worth reading). The book is an autobiography of Frank W Abagnale covering his crimes in the 60s - Interesting and very believeable considering the technology available at the time - however it would have been nice to hear a little remorse and a little about what he has done since then...
4,Engaging,"A charming, likeable con man you root for? Frank Abagnale IS that guy. Amazing to believe he got away with what he did (airline pilot, doctor, lawyer etc.) at a time in life when most kids are still trying to figure out what to major in. Even more amazing is how he turned everything around as an adult. Fast, enjoyable read.If you like this kind of likeable, conniving character, you may also like ""No One's Even Bleeding"" & ""Delano""."
4,"Really Good, but carried on with some items","I really liked the movie, and when i heard he wrote a book i wanted to read it. I would have rated a 5, but at some parts he continues on too much. Overall, if you liked the movie, your gonna like this book."
5,Factual? I don't care.,"Is everything in the story true? I have no idea. One thing that I do know to be true is that this guy can SPIN A YARN. What a fun read. Does he exaggerate? Yes, probably. Does he use sexist language? Sometimes, but I'll admit that I giggle when a guy calls me ""babe,"" so who am I to judge this author? Does he outright lie? Maybe, but who can tell? If you're looking for a fun read and you enjoyed watching the movie, go ahead and get this book. If he did make it all up, then I'm pretty impressed with his nuttiness. Enjoy."
5,HIGHLY recommended,"I bought this book for the subway ride, but I've had to restrain myself from reading it on lunch breaks and at night. I've only got two chapters left, and as much as I'm dying to read the rest, I don't want it to end!Very fluid, smoothly written, and by far the most enjoyable book I've read all year. The main character (and author) is extremely likeable despite his crimes, and his adventures are simply amazing. The biggest delight is knowing that this is actually a true story!"
3,Are we supposed to feel sorry for him?,"I realize it takes a big ego to do what Frank Abagnale Jr. did. However when he talks about the hardships of prisons in France I could not bring myself to feel sorry for him. What ever was done to him, it obviously didn't work. He went right back to scamming people. I know he is supposed to be some sort of Anti-Hero, but that just doesn't work for me. He comes across more as an arrogant jerk than an anti-hero. I just could not bring myself to root for him in anyway. The only reason I finished the book is because I was on a long flight, and had nothing else to read. Here's hoping the movie is better."
2,Movie was MUCH better!,"I loved the movie, it inspired me to stop at the bookstore on the way home and buy the book. However, it read like a penthouse forum letter! (Not that I have much experience reading those...but, anyway!) It should have been called ""Catch an STD from me! I got a lot of sex from foxes"", he used the word foxes a lot in the book while refering to women. It just felt like he was a very insecure person, he needed to reiterate time and again how tall he was, how handsome he was, and how much he scored. But, he was a criminal, and most criminals are insecure. The movie I give 5 stars, it is very different from the book. I read the book in a day, so, it did hold my, if only to see if his writing could possibly get worse."
5,Brilliant....I'd like to meet this man!,"The only reason he got away with all he did is because of his intelligence and tremendous confidence. A very likable ""character"" who tested himself and the world around him. What's odd is that, although he was breaking the law, I was ""rooting for him"" the whole time."
3,Very Entertaining,"I really enjoyed this book. It is a great first person account of the con artist. It also re-teaches an old lesson. Audacity is almost always taken for authority.Abagnale learned at a very young age that honest people do not usually expect to be taken advantage of by someone who is dressed well and is articulate. He used his good looks and air of confidence to do things that seem and should be impossible.Catch me if you can is a book that is very difficult to put down. I would recommend it for a little mind candy to any reader interested in suspense. It is the real life version of Sheldon's ""Master of the Game"" minus the romance."
1,Fat-free literature: tasteless without substance,"A true account of this man's life might truly be interesting if written by a more subjective source. The hyberbole and bravado laced in this tale exposes it for what it is- another con, this time on the reader! There might be some basis in fact to some of these stories, but what we are left with are simply written ""vignettes"" without any insight into the man who generated these charades. The book ends apruptly without any resolution. This material might have made a mildly interesting (if poorly written) magazine piece."
3,The true story of a fake..,"Frank W. Abagnale's true crime/memoir book tells the story of a lost time when people were more trusting, and airlines that actually first-class. Abagnale bilked various banks out of about 2.5 million dollars in his crime career, told basically unapologitically by the man himself. It is interesting to see how the young man gets himself out the various jams he gets in, but the reader also winces because he feels that Abagnale wrecklessly disregards the consequences of impersonating pilots or doctors, and it is felt that Abagnale is lucky that no one died from his crimes. It's ok, but it's quite forgetable"
2,Hard to believe & Hardly Modest,"The author's exploits may have been true, but I doubt they were accurately reflected in this book. I was skeptical of the non-stop cons and impersonations performed by Abagnale, not to mention the bragging details. This book started out good but was not very interesting for the most part due to its far-fetched nature.I would like to have found out how the author ended up on the right side of the law but the book ended abruptly and left me hanging."
2,HOW TO SUCCEED AS A TOTAL DIRTBAG!,"This guy actually seems proud of his exploits. Wow. Has he no shame? And why does our world embrace the bottom of the barrel like this? It's an interesting read...but like the movie ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"" it glorifies someone who is deviant and destructive, then people cheer him on. I don't get it! But the bigger the creep/con man/hellraiser you are in this world...the more the gullable public wants to hear about you. What a shame. ..."
2,Abagnale Meets Walter Mitty,"I realize it was a different world in the 1960's & 1970's, but some of Mr. Abagnale's alleged exploits are, frankly, beyond the realm of credibility. (He traveled throughout Europe with an entire entourage of airline stewardess'. Better yet, no one in the group was aware they were scamming their way across Europe!). This book is simply an amusing tale. Save your money and look for this book at a yard sale or even on eBay. This book was a major disappointment."
5,Couldn't Put it Down,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Being a police officer, the stunts that this guy pulled off are absolutely intriguing to me. You have to respect the guy for the guts he had."
4,Certainly Entertaining,"This is a pretty interesting story and an entertaining read about a teenage forger and imposter. Quite a bit of detail is provided into his criminal acts and techniques. One disappointment is that not much insight is given into Abagnale's motivations. Some events in the story seem like a stretch, but I am naturally skeptical. Even so, I am sure it is mostly accurate.Though it is the same overall story, this book differs quite a bit from the DiCaprio/Hanks movie."
4,DR,"This book really held my attention, hard to put down. It was well written along with all of the things frank pulled it almost seemed to be fiction at times."
3,Compelling story that is poorly written.,"The best thing about Catch Me if You Can is that it again verifies that Hollywood takes too many liberties with a true story. I read the book with as ""fact checker"" and found that Frank Abagnale's life was more interesting than the one portrayed in the Spielberg movie. However, the writing style is plodding and self conscious as though Abagnale is holding something back. Abagnale's relationship w/ the FBI agent chasing him was nothing like the one portrayed in the movie."
5,Unrivalled entertainment,"My comments on the title.'Catch Me If You Can,' swallowed my emotions whole. I ached from laughing. I cried. I felt outraged even. Following my own experiences of interviewing prisoners incarcerated in an middle eastern hell hole - compared to Frank Abagnales' barbaric treatment in Perpignan, France, these cockroach infested holding cells were a breeze by comparison. The book should be made compulsory reading for all 2nd level college students. Frank's hilarious escapades left me slackjawed. No one single literary work assaulted my emotions as did 'Catch Me If You Can.' Unrivalled entertainment that will not only amuse but inflame the passions of human rights protestors the world over...."
5,The Greatest Con I Ever Met!,"I met Mr. Abagnale in Colorado in 1982, when he was speaking to the graduating class of our school....I did a small interveiw with him, and had my picture taken with him for our school paper, and the whole time....all I could think was...this man is truly wonderful! He did the crime, and he did the time, and then he turned around to make the world a better place! Such a charming man is he...that I bought this book....I LOVED IT....somehow in all my moves, I lost it, so I am here to buy another one.....Keep up the good work!"
3,very imaginative,"Frank Abagnale may have committed these crimes but there are too many organizations out there to stop him. The American Society of Questioned Document Examiners (ASQDE); the Forensic Documents Examiners; The Banking Security Corporation, etc. Faking documents for the Bar Association --- Can he really pass their tests without a high school diploma? That takes the cake and makes me really wonder if he did all these things. Watch out world: do your homework when you want to hire a lawyer.Stiffer sentences worldwide should have been enforced; after-all, PanAm was in international airline and they would have had all the hours he was in the air with them...I have no respect for this crook."
2,The movie is better than the book,"So often I hear ""the book is better than the movie"", but in this case that just doesn't apply.This book is absolutely *loaded* to the rafters with obnoxious alliteration and ""clever"" turns of phrase. One thing is clear to me: Abagnale wrote this by himself. The movie is a *much* more enjoyable way to experience the story (there are some differences in the narratives, but I'm in this for entertainment, not research). Abagnale is a remarkable man in *many* respects, but I don't think writing is one of them."
4,reminder of how can kid turn out screwed up,"reading the book. it reminds me that kids who does not understand ""accountability""this is happening everywhere and still now. parents should be more observant about whether their kids are being accountable to their action. otherwise, they may turns out wrong like frank."
4,Not Bad,"I read this book after watching the movie (staring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio). Before I started I knew I liked the story, but I didn't realize how much. I loved reading Abagnale's account of his life of crime. I enjoyed hearing of his exploits as an airline pilot, a doctor, a professor, and a lawyer. I also liked the novel's open frankness about the author's misdeeds.However, I thought the book was not especially well written. Abagnale recounts his adventures dryly and with little emotion. I also felt somewhat deprived with the novel's ending. Frank Abagnale went on to work for law enforcement and securities firms, but that is only mentioned in a question and answer with the author after the story. I would have liked to have heard more about how he crossed from the wrong side of the law to the right.All in all, I would recommend this book as an easy weekend read."
4,A captivating quick read!,"""Catch Me If You Can"" never fails to keep the reader's attention from beggining to end. It amazes me how Mr. Abagnale was able to mascarade as a pilot, professor, doctor, FBI agent, and a whole slew of other professions without ever being caught.As Mr. Abagnale writes on his web site, this book is not intended to be a biography but a fictionalized account. Thus, some of the details may have been altered and some of the plot may have been dramatized. I would have liked to have known exactly which parts of the book were true and which are fictionalized. But nonetheless, I would highly reccomend reading this fast-paced, exciting book!"
5,The most interesting and humorous book on true crime!,"This book was absolutely the most interesting and humorous book I have read in a long time! I have never heard about this guy until I read this book,and I've heard there is a movie either coming out about this story or that is already out but have not seen it yet. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. It's fasicnating being in the mind of this conman, reading how little simple things got him over $2.5 million!! It makes me laugh when I see how he did these things so easily."
1,Book is the Biggest Con of All,The book purports to be the escapades of a mid-1960s con man. The biggest con is getting anyone to pay good money or to spend good time reading it. I spent 10 cents for the book at a yard sale and took it to the beach for a light read -- and I was ripped off. The awful writing and ridiculously outdated sexual phrasing made this one of the most painful reads I've had in a long time.Is the book true? I have no idea -- and it doesn't matter. The author is so thoroughly dislikeable and pompous that you just don't care.It's not often that I'd tell someone to see the movie rather than read the book. But this is one of those times.
5,What a brain!!!,"This book is certainly one of the most unique stories you will ever read! As much as I cannot back the moral, the characteristic of the story though is superb, shocking, exiting, breathtaking and very well written. I listened to a radio interview with Frank, and I must say he sounds exactly as the character in the book! He is very sharp, humorous and well spoken. No wonder why the FBI decided to keep such a brain rather than letting it rot in a cell."
4,"Breezy, beach read...not like the movie","I'll start by saying I saw the movie, which I enjoyed immensely, about 18 months before I read this book. The movie was an entertaining cat and mouse game between a con man and an FBI agent. This is basically Frank Abagnale, the con man, telling us all how he did it.Abagnale is clearly a very talented and smart individual, and yes, you start to root for him, even though he's doing things that are wrong and harmful. It's entertaining to read, and Abagnale's ""accomplishments"" during his fraudulent crime spree are quite impressive.Still, I was a little disappointed with Abagnale's self examination, which was rather perfunctory, and the descriptions of all the frauds start to get a little numbing after a while. I bought this book for some light reading after reading a couple of particularly difficult and dense books. It's certainly entertaining, but some readers will be left yearning for a little more analysis into the author's character and actions."
3,Shouldn't this be filed in the educational section?,This was an interesting book. It's amazing to think that one guy could set his mind to work and come up with so many cons. It was a bit of a dry read; Abagnale's style is straight and to the point with no embroidery. His attitudes about women were a bit annoying and self-congratulating. In that he kind of reminded me of Heinlein. Nevertheless it was a fun read.
2,Horrible (Non)Ending,"Except for the ending, I would have rated this book somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. But when I reached the end I felt like someone had ripped out the last pages. We know (from the beginning of the book) that he served time in prison in the US, and that he eventually went to work for the FBI. What had my curiosity as much as anything throughout the book was how he made the transition from crook to crook-catcher - and I was totally disappointed to find out that none of that is included.If you like reading books where someone has...discarded the last half, then this is the book for you.Someone wrote in another review that they thought the earlier editions had a more complete ending, with updates of what the author was doing at the time. If that is so, I would recommend searching for one of the earlier editions and not waste your money on this disappointment."
4,"Stranger than fiction, and more fun to read.","This is a classic example of why reading a book is usually better than the movie version. So many funny, incredible stories of Mr. Abagnale's ingeniously brazen scams that aren't shown in the movie. I greatly enjoyed every chapter and daring caper. Banks should count themselves lucky that there are few such shrewdly effective ""rip-off artists"" in the world. Single women, airlines, and hospitals as well. For years, he successfully impersonated doctors, lawyers, airline pilots, and university professors, first doing research and planning that merited a Phd. in con arts."
5,The life I've always secretly wanted.,"""Catch Me If You Can"" follows the life of Frank W. Abignale - one of the greatest con men of all time who single handedly lived his life on fradulant checks and scams that just leave you thinking how amazing he was. This book is the autobiographical account of Abignale's teenage years from when he first created a scam on his father's Mobil credit card. There are so many times in this book that I had to step back and think about the air of confidence that Abignale displayed, yet curiously inside he was often paranoid and worried about the authorities catching up to him.Some of the stories are absolutely outrageous. I loved them all! This book also talks about his time in prison across seas in Europe and how terrible he was treated in the French prisons.If you liked the movie then you should definately read this book. It further explores his adventures and exploits in greater detail and includes many capers that were not in the movie. A must read!"
3,Sunday Afternoon Page Turner,"I saw the movie. I was intrigued to read the real story. It's a quick read, and different enough fro mthe film to be truly entertaining and eye-opening. Amazing scenes from the French prison. I recommend this book. Take it on a x-country flight to while away the hours from NY to Iowa."
3,"Interesting, but pointless","Despite the great begining, Frank W. Abagnale & Stan Redding's `Catch Me If You Can' becomes a big `what so?' after a few chapters. While they are telling how Frank became the most wanted con is funny and interesting to learn how fragile the system is. But when they tell over and over again the same thing-- how he forged checks and pretended to be a Pan Am pilot-- the books becomes boring.In the middle of my reading I got me thinking `Why am I reading this?'. I mean it is not even entertaining me. But I went on until the last pages thinking that anything really big would happen. But it didn't. The book left me with the feeling that someone up there loves Frank W. Abagnale more than other mortals, because this guy is so lucky that it is almost impossible to believe. I think the movie may be better, once it gets a `story' from the book, and not only chronicle Frank's adventures."
2,"See the movie, skip the book","The troubled boy's quest to re-unite his separated parents, the innocence of simpler times, the glamor of American Cold War chic--well, there hinted at here. But the place descriptions are flat, the dialogue is wooden and the family dynamic is never fully developed. A notable exception--Frank Abagnale's vivid description of his life in a French prison. I think this is one of those cases where the movie will transcend the book."
3,So So,Catch Me If You Can is the story of the ultimate con artist. Some of his schemes are so involved that the reader can't help but wonder what this man could have accomplished if he applied his talents to a legitimate occupation. The book is basically an accounting of the con artists illegal and immoral deeds. This is an okay read-nothing earth shattering.
2,Liars and other Liars,"Anybody who crossed paths with either Frank Abagnale OR Stan Redding probably knows not to believe anything either of them writes.Too bad we don't have a National Truth Squad. Of course there wouldn't be nearly as many schlocky books.It's a fun read, but NOT factual,"
3,"Good, entertaining, but...","Billed as true crime or as an autobiography, but when the author admits he's the perfect liar, I found I had to read this as a novel, because I doubted a lot of what he writes. If he's so good at the con, how is this book any different. As a novel, it's entertaining at first, repetitive after awhile, and offers no clear climax. A very hard book to judge, although I gave it three stars because it is engaging somehow. The lying, conns, and sexism are hard to accept, and the author doesn't seem to feel bad for all the people he conned. Difficult to like, impossible to hate?"
3,Fun,"This is a fun book. Abagnale's intelligence and wit come through, though the writing is a bit stilted and the material quite dated. But Abagnale's ability to exploit appearances and to exploit the level of trust necessary for society to work is fascinating and very funny. Perhaps his most interesting con is his relationship with women. This is the ultimate con game, I'm afraid, and the book would have been far better had he explained his con in this regard and had he come to terms with it. Also, the book ends quite abruptly and is unsatisfying in explaining how Abagnale ultimately came to terms with himself."
4,Catch this book - if you can,"Working in the airline industry, I had the pleasure of hearing Frank Abagnale as a guest speaker at an airline-hosted seminar. (He said he owed it the airline personnel). Hearing him live was incredible. In today's world, it's amazing to hear what he got away with. I'm sure he may be one reason that airlines do 10-year background checks.... I couldn't get a copy of his book after his seminar (out of print), so I rushed to buy this copy. Hearing him live is much better than reading, but this is definitely the next best thing. It's fun and fast reading. I'm buying copies for my fellow airline workers (those in Security, Flt Ops, Inflight, Purchasing).... Oh and bankers, hotel staff, too. Is there a group he did NOT step all over? Thank goodness he's not doing it now. (At least we THINK he's not). We'd be furious with him instead of amazed. Read this book!"
3,"Congratulations Frank, then what?","This story is a wild ride... Frank Abagnale Jr. certainly swindled his way around the world in outlandish style, taking advantage of loose corporate security and the naivete, gullibility and sheer stupidity of all manner of people.What it boils down to, though, is that here is an exceptionally smart guy with a tremendous nerve who believes he's somehow entitled to live a life he hasn't earned, at others' expense. What a waste. He's a liar, a cheat, and ultimately a hollow person because of it.The story is fun, but it left me with more pity than admiration for the author. It would definitely have been a better book had we been brought to its real conclusion... how did this character make his transition into productive life? Evidently he grew up eventually, but we don't get to learn about that part."
5,"Read it, If you can!","Not a reader of fiction, fantasy, sci-fi... therefore picked up a copy of ""Catch Me If You Can"" from a bookstore yesterday...Seen the film more than 10times.. loved the film, loved the characters, loved the plot... LOVED the book even more... can't put it down... the story just flows perfectly...Makes you wonder what Franky can do at the age of 16,17 etc.A real inspiration... the book's plot is BY-FAR better than the movie... Would have been great to read it before watching the film.. still good to read it after watching the film..Overall, it's a great bookfinished it in a day"
5,Very Entertaining!,"This book really got me from the start. The author's excellent narrative style made for a fun read. He also uses metaphors very skillfully throughout, and some of the more humorous ones even made me laugh out loud.I had a hard time putting it down at times. The intelligence of this guy to pull some of this stuff off is incredible! I don't condone or justify stealing and lying, but the stories are amazing nonetheless.Read the book! I promise you'll be entertained at the true adventures of this young man."
4,"Entertaining, poor ending..","Entertaining, poor ending..Basically, the story is cool. I suspect that there are many people like this. But F.A. managed to do it ten fold...The ending though needs improvement. We know that he has worked for the past 25 years for the FBI. What we don't know is how he was caught and how he wound up working for the feds...Curious..."
4,Catch Me if you Can - Frank Abignale,"This non-fiction story is fast paced and keeps you wondering if it could possibly be true. The tale of his imprisonment is just as spellbounding as the period of time in which Frank Abiignale was on his spree of deceit and fraud. Sounding similar to the show ""The Pretender"" he a led a very short but interesting life of crime and to this day is still paying the price.I learned of Frank Abignale when I worked with a ""FraudProof Check"" that he helped to design."
4,Incredible and very interestingly funny,"I've read this book several times since 1979, bought copies for gifts( because you never get one back ) For a man to have this kind of knowledge and perception of how things worked prior to his writings, my hat's off to him. Just goes to show that anything IS POSSIBLE. Enjoy......................."
3,Not good for old folks,"I play quite a few RPG games, not an expert but somewhat proficient. This games controls are somewhat complicated for me. I found it on a par with Witcher and Mount and Blade.If you like to have more intimate control of the action, then this is a great game. If you are like me, fumble fingered and need to referr back to the manual for which button does what than save your money.Good, simple to play with decent story line games, Heros III and Lords of Magic, Diablo. Hackem-Slashem games that are easy to play Fate, Starcraft."
3,Fable,"This is a really fun game, but the only downside is that it froze on me midway. I researched the problem and apparently it doesn't handle hero saves after a certain number of times. When I have more time I am hoping to play it through with minimal saving. It was just a major bummer that I couldn't play it after I spent hours with it. I like the story and the graphics are nice."
1,Know problem: TLC shipped with invalid product keys,"This game is amazing! I'm a huge fan of the Fable series (except the new stuff, III was disappointing and Heros and The Journey are Microsoft ruining a good thing).HOWEVER!!!!It's important that you should know that it is a known issue with Microsoft that many copies of Fable: The Lost Chapters were shipped with invalid Product Keys. Also, Microsoft no longer sells or supports this game and cannot/will not provide you with a working Key, even if you provide them with a valid part number of their choice.If you are like me and purchased the game without knowing this, then look online for recommendations on how to resolve the issue. If you paid for a game, you should be able to play it, regardless of whether Microsoft supports the game anymore."
1,Completely unstable,"The game runs great, unless it decides to randomly crash to desktop. Furthermore, the inability to save when ever you want combined with the random crashes makes the game difficult to penetrate. Inquiries to microsoft about tech support results in their suggestion that you reinstall windows. Even though every other piece of software runs fine and the only problem is with Fable. Save your money."
1,Save your money,"Even though I made sure my computer met all the system requirements before opening the game, I could not get it to run for more than 15 minutes. I ended up playing the same scene over and over again (the majority of which was cutscenes) because I couldn't save. After numerous crashes, I gave up."
1,This game is not for PC users,I gave it one star because there was no way to give it less.This game when played on the X Box was great. So when it came out for PC I bought it. BIG MISTAKE! The control are too hard to learn. And when you are in a battle you can't stop to think which keys when used together work. There are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing.I wasted my money on this game. I deleted it and will never play it. Don't waste your money!
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!,"We bought a used x-box and were able to play all types of games on it. When we tried to load this game (also used) on there, the only thing it did was replay the loading screen over and over again. In so thinking that it was the used game, we went out and BOUGHT a brand new one from a different store, hoping to return the old one. This, however, turned out to not be the case. The new one did the same thing as the old one and when we tried to return it, we were told that they would trade it for the same game. We already had two defective games, why would we want a third? When I called Microsoft for a refund, they told me that I would have to talk to the retailer. Alotta good that does me since that's where I had just come from. Overall, don't get this game, it certainly isn't worth the hassle to try to get it to work."
4,Pretty darn good,"An excellent port to PC, faithfully retaining the fast-paced action of the Xbox version along with all the colorful world design and British humor. The graphics are, if anything, slightly better than in the original. The extra content is also very satisfying, as in the original your character would be getting incredibly powerful and fun to use just about the time that the game ended, making you feel a bit silly if you power-leveled at some point.Very worthwhile game with enormous replay value."
2,Fable- Lost Chapters,Fable: The Lost Chaptersgame involved a number of ethical /moral choices but in comparison to more modern RPG Fable controlled where you went and what you could do. While still enjoyable it is dated.
4,Great Fun Once You Get The Hang Of It,"The only problem I had was the product key code had exspired, with a two hour phone call to Micro Soft, there was nothing that they could have done, they instructed me to return it to amazon. Well one thing I have to say is Don't! the wonderful power of the net will find you one! Because the game is worth it and even though the game is six to seven years old , I have so much fun with it. Anybody in the mood for a game of chicken kicken!!"
1,Didn't Work,"Hello, I bought FABLE FOR WINDOWS XP on november 2011, I just got it in february 2012 because my sister in law brought it from the US to Colombia where I live. I tried to work it on my PC but the PRODUCT KEY didn't run. I tried it several times and couldn't make it work. I called Microsoft and they told me since I bought it over Amazon.com you should give me a reponse on the game failing.Can you please help me and tell me what to do next. I appreciate your help and prompt response."
4,Text Issues,For some reason in my copy the text did not always appear on screen. This made it difficult to learn some things. Also the combat can get somewhat repetitious.
5,Very nice RPG,"Back when it came out on Xbox, I was incredibly angry...I only had a silly gameboy...but when it came out for computer, I just had to have it. I found the game very fun to play, simple controls (use arrows, not wasd) and felt very fufilled as the credits finally rolled after the last battle. It doesn't take long to finish this game, but play is continuous (if you watch the entire credits) and you can always start over and switch to evil/good side for a new version of the game."
1,fable:the lost chapters,"I purchased this for my son, age 20. It does not play well on his laptop, as was advertised. Many parts are either missing or skip. I'd be interested to know if others experienced the same thing."
3,addicting but too much of...,"I would be 5 on this one all the way, because I enjoyed the game immensly (the general idea of the game), but because of personal preference I stopped playing it because of excessive gore, sexual/debasing themes, and leud art. If you like this game but don't want all the questionable material (yes, I know that it's nothing compared to other games) then may I recommend ""Fate"" by wildtangent"
3,"Ok, not really worth 19.99 if buying new.","I got lucky and found this game at a thrift store for 4.99. I had no problems installing and running the game. The controls were a bit difficult but overall, even with the difficult controls this game is relatively easy. I played all the way through both story lines (both good and evil) and it was mostly enjoyable but I felt they could have done a lot more. The graphics are good and the story is O.K. Overall, after having played many RPG's I'd say this game is NOT worth 19.99, try if you want but try to get it used."
3,"Fable is not bad, but nothing special.","Pros: Fun, Zelda-like combatNatural feeling levelling systemNice graphicsDecent character customizationCons: Really cliche, boring story with flat charactersQuests are unoriginal, boringMarriage is a pointless, underdeveloped gimmickCharacter interaction shallowMagic overpoweredToo easyWay too short"
5,Blew Me Away,"This game is the best single player RPG I've played to date, and probably my favorite single player game ever. I was told by some that the game was pretty short, but I don't think it is... and I havn't even finished it yet. Just do the side quests and this game is plenty long. Especially for the depth and work that is put into every bit of it. The game is so detailed.Give it a try. It will not dissapoint. Even if you don't like it as much as I did, it will undoubtably still be a game you enjoy. Either way it's worth the money."
3,Fabulous beginning; weak ending,"Single-hero fantasy game with a wonderful built-into-the-game tutorial, easy to use interface, well designed play flow, and fun behavior options. Lost 2-stars are from the ""mandatory"" quests, which are poorly designed and get increasingly annoying and/or icky. Earns ""Mature"" rating via adult and/or immoral action choices beyond simple violence."
3,Fun Game but I expected more,"I had pretty high hopes for this game as one of the selling points is how your every choice decides your character's fate and all that. It just does the typical point scale of good vs. evil. The other selling point is how your guide your character through his life from a child to manhood well that is not true you spend about 10 minutes as a kid, 10 minutes as a adolescent and the rest of the game having finished puberty and aging as you level. The game was also pretty quick/short as the side quests were usually short and I thought there were far too few of them.Besides those drawbacks the game was fun and I enjoyed playing it the world has some interesting interactions like stealing and other activities but it just seemed too short to me. I would definitely recommend it since it is a fun RPG and very cheap now."
2,"Crash, Crash, Crash","I wish I had listened to the people who said this game was buggy. It played OK the first few days, but the longer I play it, the worse my problems are getting. My two-year-old Dell computer exceeds the minimum system requirements. One thing I don't like about the game play is that some sequences take an hour to complete and you can't save in the middle. Now that the game crashes during saves, I probably will not be able to finish it. I tried reloading the game, but it didn't fix anything."
2,Everyone is fat!,"Let's put it this way. I can't say I vehemently disliked it because it was, in its own way, an acceptible introduction to Gilbert & Sullivan for children. This sort of programming is not uncommon for introductions to opera, operetta, and other classics, and I've certainly seen worse. Even as a self-proclaimed G&S purist, I am still not adverse to reasonable experimentation and adaptation - as this film most certainly is! - but also (as a purist) I had to cringe at some of the truly drastic changes made to the original, and I don't think that 70's pop music mixes well with G&S, either, and why on earth are most of the characters fat? They may as well have turned this over to a Japanese anime studio, which would have probably done a better job at adaptation. But for all the faults, it is kinda fun for all the same, and Anna Russell as Katisha was inspired casting."
5,Nice product,"I use it for making sewing patterns and it's fantastic. It has a nice consistency, not terribly see-through so a bit difficult to use as tracing paper, but a really nice thickness that will make my patterns last forever. The fact that it's a nice wide roll and 150 feet long means it will serve me well for a long time. Great product."
5,Great Quality,"The paper was exactly as it was advertised. Although I will need something longer the next time I order, I would recommend this product to anyone. The quality is excellent."
4,A Beginner's Defense,"John Ellis' book remains a good beginning for individuals caught up in the deconstruction phase of their lives. Deconstruction is simply untenable, and Ellis simply elucidates this. His arguments are clear, concise, and often redundant, but then this is the obverse of deconstruction, so it may need repeating. There are other challenges to deconstruction that Ellis does not make, challenges more in line with the philosophy of language and mind (e.g., Kripke, Searle, Ryle, et alia) that are more decisive, but also more complex. This simple tome, however, has enough to get one started, and if the deconstruction bug is still not eradicated, there are other compelling arguments elsewhere to bolster some of the gaps."
2,Cracks when liquids added during baking,"Although this roaster is large and attractive, it cracked in the oven when I added marinade to a roast after an initial browning. There have been reports of these kinds of roasters cracking before. Also, it is very heavy to lift in and out of the oven when its full and hot."
1,CorningWare French White Oblong Dish,"This looked beautiful online and the shipping from Amazon was prompt. It arrived in 2 days, but broken. The packaging was not adequate and they sent it with another product (which was fine). I am sending it back."
5,Truly the Heart....,"What is the ""heart of the matter""? For me, Graham Greene ranks with Faulkner and Conrad in his unsparingly honest, yet empathetic insight into the human heart. And, not that of great men, but of ordinary people who try hard to stay right, not always succeeding, but often failing nobly. The Heart of the Matter is to me Greene's most vivid and memorable foray into this terra incognita. Scobie is noble, flawed and fully realized. The so-called ""invented"" world through which he walks is so richly atmospheric that it hardly seems fictional.The plot here is a bit less animated than in some of Greene's other famous novels, but the richness of character and detail keeps you involved. Ultimately, this is a book I will never forget, largely because it gave me the chance to view the world through the eyes of of another human being, which to me is truly the ""heart of the matter."""
3,"Frustrating, but very good literature","This book was very sad and frustrating. This man named Scobie, so honest and always well-meaning, always craving peace from his self-created hell. Always he feels pity for the women he once loved, and out of the pity grows a sense of responsibility, an intense desire for them to be happy. In the end this is too much for him."
3,Vintage Green -- a downer wrapped in religious struggle (but worth reading),"Vintage Graham Greene, with a police inspector forced to choose between his Catholicism, a wife he endures out of pity and a lover he feels he is hurting. The characters are finely drawn, and the main character Scobie's take on living the Catholic life is fascinating. The religious context is a fixture in Greene books, and this is no exception.Quite a downer, but a worthwhile read"
5,Superb,"This remains one of the best books I've ever read. It contains some of the best lines from 20th Century literature such as ""... a saint whose name nobody could remember"" along with some of the most unforgettable characters struggling through universal themes. I couldn't stop thinking about it years after finishing it and it remains one of the landmarks of my reading life."
2,Hardly Mr.Green's best!,"The Heart of the Matter tells the story of Scobie - a British Police officer working in West Africa. Green's novel debates, like a lot of his books, the Roman Catholic faith. Scobie has an affair and he feels the only way to escape life's difficulties is suicide, but of course suicide would mean eternal damnation. I disliked this book. I became a Graham Green fan after reading Brighton Rock and I felt this book looked interesting. I was mistaken. This was plot-wise almost deadening. As always Green's characterisations are fabulous. Scobie, his wife and Wilson are all fully developed and fully believable characters but they're not very interesting! The plot is pretentious. It is a simple short story plot dragged out to a novel's length. Overall it was a disappointment and would make me question Mr.Green as a writer."
3,I think it was a good story but dragged out too long.,I liked the theme of this story alot but I had a hard time getting into the book. Mr. Greene really can't grab peoples attention on the spurr of the moment. Sure the title sounded good but it was hard to sit down long enough to get into it.
5,fast read,The Protocol is a great book if you are interested in a medical suspense. I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down. If you are looking for a book to read over the summer then you chose the right book.
1,constant clicking and static,"this is a horrible phone, it has terrible reception and constant clicking and static"
5,Help for a sick friend,"I bought this as part of a gift basket for a friend who was going through chemo treatments. She was having a lot of trouble swallowing foods and couldn't find anything ""tasty"" so mealtimes were a struggle. The soup was very easy for her husband to fix for her, she loved the flavor and it was easy to swallow - it really helped her through a difficult time."
1,Stainable? Not!,"I agree with Dean (previous review). After completely following instructions on the packaging and tube, I filled in some areas in sentimentally-valued picture frame. Disaster! Using a variety of products (including Minwax items), this stuff does not accept a stain! It appears that I will have to diassemble the frame and completely clean the filler from the wood. Having a simple project turn into this sort of thing is not my idea of fun! Use this product if you have a yen for self-inflicted pain!"
1,Easy to use but looks horrible once you paint/ stain over it!,"I bought this product and was impressed at first with how easy it was to use. Little did I know the downside to it. I used it to fill in some gaps in a cabinet I was refinishing. It went on well and smoothed easily. There is a very small amount of shrinking so you may have to go over it again later. I applied, sanded, reapplied a little more and cleaned it. I was so excited to finally paint my cabinet. Thats when I discovered that this wood filler is not all its cracked up to be. I was able to see the areas I filled in and it looks blotchy! I'm so mad! The paint absorbs differently into the minwax wood filler and you can very easily point it out. I was using a satin finish paint in black and now my cabinet looks horrible! I just may have to redo it all over again. All my hard work, down the drain.Thanks Minwax."
1,NON-stainable minwax wood filler,I bought a tube of the Minwax stainable wood filler and applied it exactly as instructed. I then applied a Minwax cherry stain on Alder and found this product to be a total failure. I would not recommend this product to any consumer shopping for a quality stainable wood filler.
1,Won't accept stain,Minwax Stainable Wood Filler failed to accept Minwax walnut stain. I am now left with a finished project with very light spots where the filler was used to cover nail holes. I advise you not to use this product.
1,Minwax wood filler is NOT stainable!,"We purchased the minwax filler over elmers thinking that minwas filler to minwax stain would be best for our new wainscoat. We were wrong! The wood filler does not take stain and has basically ruined our stain grade crown, trim and wainscoat. The stain around every filled nail hole has a blochy/orange-ish spot even after proper drying of the filler and sanding. If I could give this product a rating less an a 1 I would! After reading all the reviews and adding mine, makes me wonder if the positive reviews are real."
4,good value for my e39 bmw...,"I bought these to replace my old rotors on my E39 BMW. I paired them with ceramic ""dustless"" brakes. They work perfectly and Im happy with the results. only complaint is that the rotor's are showing superficial rust where the rotor meets the wheel. Again, Im very happy with the value."
4,Tony Hawks pro skater,"The boys (7 & 11) enjoy this game. We only have Mac OS X so we can't (or don't know how) access some of the games but the boys seem to enjoy the material that is available. We have 2 Mac G4's and an iMac, the software works well on all of them. I like that its clean, not violent beyond some oofs and faint blood spatters when the skater crashes. I wish I could figure out how to get a joy stick to work with the computers as it would be much easier to do the maneuvers than with the keyboard. We aren't sophisticated computer gamers at all. This is pretty popular with the boys when they aren't allowed to play some online downloadable games. I like that it is inexpensive and can be played off line."
3,Panthoderm,"I used it up in 3 weeks, kind of expensive for it to last only 3 weeks. I only used it on my hands."
5,"Excellent, honest","This is an excellent, honest account from a sisterwho wanted to believe Scott Peterson was innocent.Tremendous read and very heartfelt."
4,Good book,"I'm not generally into true crime books, but I was pretty fascinated by this case. I read this and Witness For The Prosecution. I'm not sure either is a book one ""enjoys."" I didn't read them for enjoyment, but rather to try to make some sense for myself out of this baffling crime. I think this book helped me to do that, and I am glad Ms. Bird wrote it."
5,Courageous Book,"Anne was a true friend to the Petersons by taking Scott in to her home after Laci's disappearance. Technically she was harboring a murderer! Once she realizes that he WAS the murderer, she must have been devastated.Some say Anne shouldn't have capitalized on her special relationship with the Petersons, but the truth is they used HER. I can't imagine how traumatic it must have been for her to know this guy held her baby during its christening! After all she went through helping this murderer, Scott, she deserves the income and peace of mind that this book hopefully has given her.I love Anne's writing and hope this will not be her only book. I think she should write more - fiction or non-fiction - she's truly gifted. She's so level headed, a great mother and wife, a loyal and loving family member to those who raised & care for her."
3,another view,"The title is misleading. It should be ""33 reasons my brother is a jerk"". There are no solid reasons he killed his wife. [...]. They did not use anne in court since there really was nothing to go on but her opinon.I thought the book was interesting as far as getting an inside look at what scott was like socially and with family, also lacey's personality. I feel bad for the author to find her birth family, only to have this terrible thing happen and come between them."
3,Finally a Peterson family member without blinders on!,The book was written fairly well for a first timer. It is an interesting look at the case from a different angle. Maybe other members of Scott's family will wake up and smell the guilt.
4,An interesting perspective,"The book may not provide many revelations to those that familiar with the case, but for my part, the inside view of Peterson definitely makes for an interesting and insightful read. Probably one of the most important books written on the case and definitely worth the read."
4,A Fast Read,"It humanized the half-sister Anne Bird. I found myself understanding why she wanted so desperately to believe in her half-brother Scott's innocense.Anne Bird was born of Scott's mother, Jackie, who promptly gave her up for adoption. Fortunately for Anne, she was adopted by a loving and stable family.Which was probably the best thing to ever happen to her. In this book, Jackie Peterson is portrayed as unstable and her display of favoritism towards her ""golden boy"" Scott is undeniable. I remember when all of this was all over the news, so I believe Anne was not being cruel in her assessment of Jackie. If anything, I felt Anne was being too kind.This book is a very fast read, and don't buy it if you want an indepth analysis. Instead, buy it to understand that Laci and Connor were not the only victims of Scott's sociopathy."
4,Anne Bird it a nasty person,"I liked the book. I would have liked to have met Laci as she seems to have been a nice person.But really the author Anne Bird is kind of nasty and petty. For example she complains about Scott Peterson going out to diner with the extended family and ordering a nice bottle of wine while her husband had the house wine and she got stuck kicking in more money than she felt fair when they split the bill. She really has some issues and needs to seek professional help, lots of anger there from her being given up for adoption."
1,Bood Money,"This book is a shameless attempt to cash in on a famous case and nothing more. Ms. Bird's 33 reasons are the proof of this crass motive because, to put it mildly, they are lame.For example, Ms. Bird says that because Scott arrived at her home in a variety of cars is proof that he killed Laci. Because Scott maintained his pool, this is proof that he drowned Laci in the pool. I'm not giving away any of the book, because Ms. Bird has already discussed these points in the media.The author came from a privileged background and apparently lacks the compassion to appreciate the difficult circumstances that led to her birth mother, Jackie giving her up for adoption. If Ms Bird were an honest person, she would admit that she was influenced by the media witch hunt surrounding the Laci Peterson case, and that is what convinced her of Scott's guilt, rather than the 33 reasons she describes."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a terrilble book. I feel bad that Anne Bird feels so guilty, but that's about the extent of anything positive I can say about this read. Don't waste your money."
1,Peterson book,"product was advertised as new, purchased as a gift, obviously not in new condition, there were stains on the jacket, and underlining in pen in the text."
1,Outrageous and Disgraceful,"Geez, they simply can't let that woman rest in peace, the money makers are out there writing sensational stuff for the idiots!"
2,Ugh...Sorry Anne,"You can tell this was a cathartic project for the author and a necessary one in my opinion. I wish there had been more details, but that is my own morbid curiosity about this case, I suppose.The editor of this book should be ashamed. There were many mistakes in print, making some passages difficult to understand and some of the pages were missing the last few words on the right side of the pages which was maddening. Also, the picture section was so small they were more like thumbnails and almost impossible to see!There are a few questions I have: what was the significance of mentioning Scott wearing his wedding ring? She says this multiple times but never explains herself, also I would have liked to know more about her relationship with Scott's family as it stands now. What about Don?I suppose Ms. Bird feels better writing this and I wish her and her family well."
3,It really didn't reveal any new information.,I have to wonder about the motivation behind this book. It had to have caused pain to her re-discovered birth mother and didn't really tell the reader anything he didn't already know from watching news coverage of the event and the trial.
3,Interesting book,"Fairly well written and interesting theories. Not sure all is believable, but good read if you're like me and interested in ""why?"" he did it!"
4,Did He Do It? - Review of Blood Brother,"By the authors own admission she hardly knew her half-brother Scott Peterson since she had been given up for adoption as a baby. However, Scott did live with Ann (the author) during much of the time the entire country was searching for a very pregnant Lacy Peterson. I felt the authors pain at being overjoyed to have connected with her roots while at the same time struggling with her gut instinct knowing she will lose her family again. Ann Baird shows us inside the world of Scott Peterson as only a family member could see. I highly recommend the book to any true crime reader."
2,33 Reasons NOT to read this book,"I was extremely disappointed with the book and the author. Basically, most of the information in the book was about MS. BYRD, HER life and her ""FEELINGS"" about Scott and how/why he murdered his wife. There were very few CONCRETE ideas as to why she believes he killed Laci and even then, most of her ideas are laughable. The book has very detailed descriptions of conversations and memories. I find it hard to believe that Ms. Byrd can recall exact conversations that occurred many years before this book was written. She comes off as very spoiled, over-indulgent and alcoholic. Because this book is mostly about Ms. Byrd, I would have found it interesting had she been an interesting person. Instead, this book is filled with boring details and 33 unbelievable reasons that Scott killed Laci. (And I truly believe he did kill her.)"
3,comment about says it.,"I have read a lot on Scott Peterson case. This book is good but over all no real insight, pleasant enough but this perspective I could of went either way on. Bottom line didn't mind reading it, it was a very fast read, but if I had not read it I don't think I would of felt like I missed anything. What I do find is if you get what I call iffy books used, you never waste your time and money. One good thing about amazon they have used books."
3,A person's need to justify...,"I agree, those who followed the Scott Peterson case and want to know the *surface* details of what he was doing while the police were out looking for Laci and Conner will find this book to be an interesting read (check it out from your local library though, don't spend your hard earned money for such a light read).All in all, I found this book to be disturbing, but not for the most obvious reason--that being getting a brief glimpse at the behaviors of a psychopath. No, I was disturbed by Anne Bird's portrayal of her relationships with Scott, Laci, and Jackie Peterson. The details she provided failed to substantiate such ""closeness"" to any of them.However, I think anyone who has dealt with a psychopath will understand her need to justify being taken in (ie, fooled and used) by both Scott and Jackie as well as her need to write this book."
2,33 reasons not to buy the book,"The book title is misleading. I was looking to expect 33 good reasons why Anne Bird believes her brother was guilty, and expecting the book to be all about that. Instead the list was just a lousy list of things that would never hold up in court as proof of murder. Don't buy the book, rent it instead at your local library. You will be glad you did and you will thank me."
4,Interesting Book,"An easy read.Also - no real evidence against Scott Peterson. Just alot of speculation.Have to agree with Jackie Peterson regarding Scott's questionable behavior after Laci was reported missing - ""How is someone supposed to act under those circumstances""I just checked out ""A Deadly Game"" by Crier so I will see how that book compares to this."
2,Interesting...but not worth the cover price,"I read the book in one day, it gave some interesting background details on the Peterson family but nothing too in depth. HEr 33 reasons were basically his reactions to to the case as it moved along...not any concrete evidence. Don't get me wrong, I think this man is 100% guilty but I also think that she cashed in on the opportunity to make yet another book and to make some money. Interesting reading but borrow a copy...I paid $24 for this book and it was definately not worth the price."
3,OK but not great,"Actually, I started reading Catherine Crier's book after Anne Bird's, so maybe now in comparison I'm not as impressed with ""Blood Brother.""It is an interesting read, though. On one hand, like Amber Frey, she is seemingly honestly telling her side of the story, and it does give us more insight into the character of Scott Peterson and his (ewwww) mother.It sure took her awhile to figure out her brother could have had something to do with Laci's disappearance. I guess she was just another bamboozled person temporarily fooled by Peterson. I can't really judge her for it. She did eventually put it together for herself, for her own reasons that she enumerates at the end.One thing I noticed - All of the people in her family sure seem to have a lot of discretionary income, because they always seemed to be vacationing, brunching, lunching, and travelling."
1,Not Worth It,"This book was a complete watse of money. It offered no new information, except that Scott's mother is NUTS. I read it in one afternoon, and was left with a book no one wants to even borrow! Sorry Anne, but your fifteen minutes of fame is over."
1,How to To Profit from a tradegy!!,This book is a waste of money-I am honestly sorry I bought it!!Bird doesnt tell us anything new -what is obvious however is her own unhappiness with her own lot in life-and her ability to profit from this whole tragic episode.I wish i had made a donation to the Laci/Conner fund-I would imagine the author will not be making any such donation from her blood money-she should remember that what goes round comes round!!I hope her childrens books about her do not spew the same vitriole for her as she did for Jackie!!
1,Blood Brother Boring,"Absolutely mundane. Ramblings of everything you already knew.Don't waste your time or money. If you must read it, get it at the library. Wagsey California"
2,Disappointing Read,"Considering her unique relationship to the Peterson family, I expected more insight into the family dynamics. While I'm sure that she knew and loved Laci, her claims of condering her a ""sister"" and the extreme closeness she shared with her & Scott seems unlikely, since she never once visited them at their home, nor did she ever meet Laci's family. This was a tragedy for all involved, but the book is superficial, and contains many facts that were well reported in the media. Save your money and buy Catherine Crier's book, a much better take on the Peterson investigation and trial."
4,Blood Brother,"If you find yourself still interested in the case of Laci Peterson, then this book is for you. It takes you on a journey through the life and death of Laci Peterson through the overlooked point of view of Laci's sister-in-law, Anne Bird. It is a fascinating and thought-provoking book, but no matter how many books are written on this subject nothing will ever change the disheartening ending that Laci Peterson will not get to have the child she had so joyfully looked forward to raising."
4,Add another one,"If you read any other books regarding the Peterson case, there's no harm in adding another, though I do believe that anyone that knew Scott or had known the case has tried to make money off this tragic story. I have read almost every book wrote, but it got to a point of repeat. This book however does have a side no other could write about. So I would buy it again."
1,Save your money!,"This book will basically tell you everything that you already know from watching Nancy Grace and CNN. I do think that Scott Peterson is the scum of the earth, however, this book in no way proves that he committed murder. Sorry, but it's true."
2,Save your money,"This was a very disappointing read. Anne Bird offered no real insights to why she believed her brother was guilty. The writing was terrible and all the stories were contrived. The editor should have done a better job. The author was pretty much rambling in no direction until the end of the book. It was also obvious throughout the book that she wasn't really a part of the Peterson family, ""in the know"" or very close to Laci. The fact that she's trying to turn her various encounters at holiday functions into something more was very apparent. Save your money and borrow it from the library!"
3,RE: With a Mother like that!,"I read the first review above and had to say what I was thinking after reading Ms. Bird's book. What is it with Jackie Peterson? From what I read in this book, I can't help but think she knew, (if she wasn't involved), if he told her about the sitter he'd have told her about Frey and probably the conversation about ""losing his wife"". This may not have been the best book in the world but it definitely may me think something isn't right with that Mother!"
4,"""Blood Brother"" is the Perfect Complement to Mrs. Rocha's book, ""For Laci""","First I read ""For Laci"" by Sharon Rocha -- surely the saddest book I've ever experienced. I was amazed at the details Laci's mother could recall. And then upon reading ""Blood Brother"", I knew that Mrs. Rocha's memories about Scott Peterson were for real. While reading ""Blood Brother"" I was amazed at how far people will go to give the ""suspect"" the benefit of the doubt -- how much we don't want to believe anyone we personally know could be guilty of such heinous crimes. I was particularly moved at the telling of the story by Scott about the pet cemetary -- how he, though a seeming monster, deep down, needs to unburden himself from this evil that he knows is in him.... made me cry. Only Christ can listen to Scott's confession without condemning him."
4,33 Reasons My Brother Is Guilty,"Book came fairly quickly, it's in excellent shape and I am looking forward to reading it."
1,Where are the reasons??,"This is just another person making money from the deaths of Laci and Conner Peterson. Ms. Bird comes across as a very jealous sister, jealous of Laci and her beauty and jealous of Scott and his relationship with his Mother.I read this book through to the end and then I went back and re-read her ""reasons"" she believed that Scott was guilty. First of all, they weren't reasons, just senseless drivel drummed up by the publishing company and author to make it appear that there was actually a reason for her to believe in Scott's guilt.When she talks about her son going missing she doesn't let us know that he was ""lost"" in a hotel room with all his relatives and was located within a minute or so. The rest of the reasons are also misleading nonsense. Thank God I got this book from the library and didn't waste my money on it nor put any money in Bird's pocket."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I cannot believe this woman actually wrote this book. Yes, her story about reconnecting with her birthmother was interesting but just because Scott Peterson happened to be her brother doesn't mean she needed to write a book about it. Anne Bird is making money from this. It's revolting. I honestly think she just wanted to make some easy money and get some attention. She has nothing to add that we don't already know concerning his guilt. She wasn't ask to testify, so obviously the procecutors didn't feel she had anything to add. I think that their mother delivered two sociopaths, one to kill and one to profit from it. This woman is a piece of work."
4,How was Laci Murdered?,"This book gives you an opportunity to see Scott Peterson in yet another perspective. A unique perspective in that he lived with Anne AFTER Laci went missing. She reveals more examples of Scott's inappropriate behavior. Thru her eyes you see another side of Scott. She also gives you more insight into Jackie Peterson, her relationship with Scott and her DISLIKE for Laci.She offers a new hypothesis as to HOW Laci was murdered. This book is worth the read if you are interested in the case."
4,read if you want to know what scott was doing while lacey was missing,"i enjoyed reading the book. it is very easy to read and it gives good insight into a sister's true love, albeit ""blind love,"" the creepy side of scott peterson, and how different family members dealt with the tragedy. a better read is ""inside the mind of scott peterson,"" keith ablow. now he gives insight to how family members DIDN'T deal with the tragedy."
4,"Blood Brother or not, it was obvious.","After reading Amber Frey's release I couldn't wait to read this book, Blood Brother. I found this book filled with alot of informative answers as to what Scott was doing during the time after Laci's disappearance. I don't know how Scott's sister Anne Bird kept quiet with her information even though she wanted to believe in him. How obvious!"
1,Just my opinion,"Not worth the paper its printed on. Sour grapes it looks like, her mother gave her away and kept Scott, not only that they were well off. I take what she says with a grain of salt. I truly believe shes just trying to cash in on a tragedy. She should be ashamed of what she is doing to her family !! Would you write a book like this about your brother?? Just as sick as Amber Frey."
1,"Anne, why the need?","I had thought Scott was guilty. Then I found out he was my cousin (as are you, we share the same great-great grandparents). So I started researching the case. How can a man be convicted on the way the media portrays him? Anne, I am confused about why you felt the need to write this book when Scott had already been convicted? Also, you failed to provide any compelling evidence to me to prove his guilt. It's heartbreaking."
1,What is wrong with the world today?,"How can you people who liked this book actually say its something everyone who likes a good suspense should read!? This is about two families who's lives have been completely destoryed televised for people's sick pleasure.I saw on the news all those losers who cheered when Peterson was convicted. ""Yay, lets all cheer for a man who we never met face to face who is going to get the death sentance"" Sick, sick, sick!I especially hate all those people who follow the story detail for detail, for Gods sake people, get some lives quick before you realize you are making complete (...) out of yourselves.You people need to realize that if his own sister or mother, or whoever wrote this book from hell itself would do this, think of how sick and demented you were if you actually followed this case!Go ahead, click the un helpful button, I dare you!"
1,Cha - ching!,"Another lame attempt to line the wallets of Gloria Allerd and two more ""victims"" of Scott. Spend your money on something important...a local womens' shelter, childrens' hospital, Lacie and Conor's memorial fund."
1,I can see the relationship,"Yep, this one is related to Scott Peterson. No talent for anything but trying to get money off a young, dead woman. It IS disgraceful. Money never lasts, reputation goes with you to the grave. Hope she visits Lacy and baby Peterson's graves and lets them know how thankful she is to be getting her pieces of silver."
1,Waste of Time,Thank goodness I only spent 50 cents for this book at a thrift store and still feel like I was ripped off. Anne Bird wrote this for her gain. She had only meet Laci a few times but professes to have been so close to her. What a joke!
4,Blood Brother: Scott Peterson Review,"I thought the book was very interesting. It took a look from an angle we seldom heard about...from the sister. I thought the book was well written, and since this case draws so many of us to read anything we can get our hands on, this book should also be read. Even she questions whether or not Scott is guilty or innocent. Great read!"
2,33 Problems I had with this book,"I purchased this book after Ann Bird's appearance on Oprah with the hopes of getting an inside look at the Petersons, who seem to be a very dark and dysfunctional family. However, Ms. Bird did not deliver on anything new or substantive. I also came away with the impression that her relationship with Laci wasn't as close as she would have had readers believe and that her book was more an opportunistic vehicle for cashing in on the Rocha family tragedy than anything else."
2,Wait for it to come out in paperbook,Anne Bird does not really shed any new light on the whole Peterson case. She did however manage to explain the whole Jackie Peterson/adoption thing. Wow! She should be very happy not to be affiliated with this family. What a bunch of losers! Don't waste your money.
1,"Should Have Called it ""Blood Sister"" Instead","I have absolutely no love lost nor sympathy for Scott Peterson. But the fact that this book was even written is repulsive to me. To betray a family you claim you want to know better for a few bucks is insane. Haven't Scott's parents been through enough?Oh, and there was nothing earth shattering in this book. No new tidbits of info. Just a tattletale book from a spoiled and greedy family member. (Don't buy the book, do like I did -- read someone else's!)"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I honesty think this woman just wanted to make some easy money and get some attention. She has nothing to add that we don't already know concerning his guilt. She wasn't ask to testify, so obviously the procecutors didn't feel she had anything to add. I think that their mother delivered two sociopaths, one to kill and one to profit from it. This woman is a piece of work."
4,Charm school for you!,"I love these books and so thrilled that I found them on AMAZON!! I had previously read them as a child spending summers with my grand mother who took the course in the 60's or 70's. The books are a course in developing a daily routine to increase beauty, poise & style. The books have chapters about etiquette in general, meals, conversation, dating do's / don'ts there is a lot to offer. Please remember these were written in the 60's so you will laugh at some of the beauty advise, however the message is still valuable today.These books are a delite for sure!"
4,Delightful illustrations and imaginative solution.,Good story line and delightful illustrations will make this book a popular storytime favorite. Shows how friendship grows and that problems can be solved by using your brains. Children would probably enjoy thinking up other adventures for Lila & Albert and their farmyard friends.
5,Harlow Excels at Comedy,"I've seen alot of Harlow films, and in my opinion, this is one of the best. It's funny, upbeat, and although the costumes aren't as striking as in some of her other films, I think that it suits her character. Harlow is perfectly cast and in her element in this film."
5,amazingly comfortable for men and women,"First of i'll start by saying i'm a guy and finding panties that fit well is difficult. These panties are some the best panties that i have found so far, soft with plenty of coverage and they don't ride up like other panties. Tends to stay put really well. The wide gusset is a big plus as well for men. I totally recommend for any woman or man."
4,great but a bit large,"I wear a size 8 in every other panty I have ordered, but these seem a bit large. Could have gotten by with a 7. Other than that, a great panty! comfortable with plenty of stretch in the front that a man needs.It has now been 2 months since this original review in December and I have ordered and received this panty in size 7 and it fits perfectly! Liked it so much I have ordered every color I could find!"
5,SIZING INFORMATION,"I ordered these a size down based on other reviews. Mistake. I am a size 4 jean, small shirt, so I bought the smallest size panties, a 5. They were too small. The sizing is accurate. My hips are 36 inches, I should have bought the size 6s. I am now stuck with 3 pairs of panties that are too small (they still fit, but are not very flattering)"
4,best band for the buck,"I've tried several other brands and these seem to be the ones. they dont ride up, dont pinch, and are worth every penny. I will be ordering more of these real soon."
3,On the small side,"These fit smaller than all of the other ""size 6"" underwear I have bought on Amazon. They are also not as comfortable."
3,Great fit but wear quickly,Let me start by saying I love the way these panties fit. They are comfortable and the style is cute. However both pairs that I bought are showing signs of wear after just one washing. I believe it is due to the material they are made out of. This bothered me because Vanity Fair is a good name and they would be perfect otherwise! I will continue to wear them but I'm disappointed in the way they look now. I don't think I would buy them again.
2,Started out good....,Well I am bummed to say the least. I bought two pair of these panties 2 months ago and thought great my quest for underwear that doesn't ride up has ended. Well here I am now having worn these several times and had them go through several washings and yes they are now riding up .... I will not buy these again. I guess my quest continues....Darn I wish the Victoria's Secret people would bring back there older versions... I loved those!!!
5,Comfortable and attractive,I love these panties. They're super comfortable but sexy enough to wear with a lacy black bra. Wear 'em to work; wear 'em to church. Feel all nice and fuzzy about your panties.
3,Better Buy,These are the most comfy I have found and were hard to find. The prices here are crazy esp. with shipping costs. Good news I found these for 3 for $18.50 at Macy's they have the lace type as well. Can't say enough good things about the bikini's though they are really great and I recommend them.
5,Nice.,"I like these. The material is nice, they fit well. Overall, a good purchase. I will probably buy more soon."
5,Good stuff,"This is a pretty good movie. It's basically about a high school girl named Nikita (Essence Atkins) who is in love with her English teacher Mr. Jackson (Kenny Lee). Throughout the entire movie she trys desprately to get with Mr. Jackson while she maintains her undercover business (she is stealing clothes from her job). She trys numerous times to get Mr. Jackson to get with her, but he is already taken, by the schools assistant principal Mrs. Fox (Mari Morrow). Towards the end everything starts to fall apart and Nikita must make some changes. The answer is, will it be soon enough? Watch this movie and see."
1,VIEWER BLUES,"STOP !!!!do not purchase this film. essence is adorable and fairly engaging but KENNY LEE is HORRENDOUS !! mr jackson is UNBELIEVABLE, UNINTERESTING, just a DREADFUL actor. my eyes and ears were throughly HAZED. when you see this film think of rosanne barr singing the national anthem....yes it is that AWFUL."
3,A real sleeper,"Mintzberg goes back and forth on the issue of Stratgic planning. Basically, he quote's about 50 other authors thoughts on planning. I didn't find this book helpful and it was borning to read so many quotes from other authors."
2,"If you don't have a solution to the problem, simply shut up!","The best of the book is it low price. After 300 pages Mintzberg still missed the point why strategic planning failed in reality. Strategic planning was always done in centralized staff department, never done at the operational level of business units. Strategic planning is quiet easy and not rocket science. So just have to convince and train business unit managers in it. Mintzberg is an academic gibberish talker, who probably did not spent a minute working at the operational level of an typical business unit. He mostly wasted his time doing small talk with CEO's."
5,Great quick resource!,"Very valuable quick reference, it was an excellent purchase and is especially recommended for pediatric interns on call. Would buy again, definitely."
3,very good quick organizer for your tired hard worked brain,This book is a pretty straight forward and easy to carry in lab coats during calls on pediatric floor.The author tried to incorporate most of the common problems faced by the house officer on the call. The organization of priorities and therapy is excellent.The only negative aspect is that it does not replace any textbooks or manuals in pediatrics; one has to read other books for individual diseases and their management. Overall it is absolutely worth it's price and useful for junior pediatricians
4,Miles Live,"There is nothing really outstanding about this performance, but as a Miles Davis collector, it was a must.The best part of the dvd is the interview with Miles which runs for about 30mins"
3,Miles Davis,"If you a Miles Davis fan this disc "":Caught Live in Germany"" while perhap not his best, it is enjoyable to listen too.The price is modest and the recording is clean."
3,Kellogg's Product 19,"I prefer the single-serve packaging of this product to boxed packaging. I appreciate this cereal's fortification with vitamins, but find it rather lacking in flavor...best served with fruit!"
5,I put it off...,"I put off buying this CD set for a long time because the listing said NOTHING. I even searched other online stores trying to find information about this item. I couldn't find anything through Google. I will save you the trouble.6 CD set containing many of Humphrey Bogarts radio ""appearances"". In fact all of his best known programs with one exception, ""The Petrified Forest"".Contents are 10 radio programs that include radio performances of:The Maltese FalconLove's Lovely CounterfeitCasablancaThe Jack Benny Program: To Have and to Have NotThe African QueenThe Treasure of the Sierra MadreThe Eddie Cantor ShowThe Humphrey Bogart TheaterBold VentureAcross the Pacific"
1,Best of Bogart.. bad decision,Bought this thinking it was a CD set as described in the review.. IT IS A SET OF 4 CASSETTES AND WITHOUT THE BOOKLET.. UNLESS YOU WANT CASSETTES DON'T BUY.
1,Low Budget Gore - For Completists only,"This is a cheap grindhouse anthology of 4 stories involving a madman with a hook, some oozing weedfreaks, an evil Santa Claus and Zombie Pirates.Although there is a lot of gore and the special effects aren't so bad, the stories are very stupid and badly executed.It doesn't fit in the 'so bad it's good' category either, cause it has no entertainment-factor at all.If you're just looking for Gore and don't care about bad quality, or if you're an Anthology-Completist this might be interesting for you, otherwise be warned of this [...]."
1,Misleading,"The tire was said to have a 4"" hub but it had a 4.5"" hub. The item was returned but I lost $10 each way on the shipping Total of $20.Using the same company (Mowtownusa) I ordered another tire that was more expensive, my mower was listed for a fit and was also with an advertised 4"" hub and it also had a 4.5"" hub and looked exactly like the first one.I again lost $10 each way on the shipping The new total for shipping is $40 and nothing in my hand.I was told that the last return shipping would be returned but it wasn't. I will not buy anything from Mowtownusa again."
5,YOU DUMBASS!,"Super Milk-Chan is a very very unique anime which is also funny if you like weird humor. The art style of the show jumps around to fit the different characters. And the jokes range from harmless to dirty to just plan strange. The characters a very odd looking and really out there. The main art style can be compaired to the art style of GameBoy Advance game Wario Ware Inc., Big bold outlines with bright colors and strange yet cut character designs. The animation is clean and looks nice as well."
3,Not from Sheffield anylonger,"The Marples in the past were a very good to excellent quality tool at a reasonable price. A significant factor has always been the generous length of usable blade made of Sheffield Steel. The 2 chisels I just received are no longer made in Sheffield , rather they have a very neat plastic packaging and is marked ""made in China"".While the chisels appear to be nicely sharpened, I have already been warned by respected pros of the variable steel used in China production.I think the quality will be questionable, I am suspect, but will let the chisels I bought serve some time on my workbench and see how they measure up. It really is too bad. The era of quality tool manufacturing being accessible to the common man(reasonably priced) may be over."
1,I would give this zero stars if it were an option..,"Terrible product, don't waste your money. The photo quality is horrid even at the highest resolution setting and, if the batteries die (which they did after just four hours), all of the photos are erased."
1,Very Unhappy with this Product,"I purchased this camera for my daughter for Christmas. When I took it out of the wrapping on Christmas Eve, the LCD screen did not work (eventually we got it to work sometimes if we squeezed the front and back of the camera together almost violently). Then, the first time she wanted to download pictures, the USB jack broke loose from the casing. The Sakar rep I spoke with offered to replace the camera for me, but the camera I originally bought was so flimsy and cheap feeling, that, coupled with the defects that showed up in the first 12 hours, I have no interest in getting another one. Personally, I will never touch a Sakar product again."
1,Not impressed,This camera was not impressive. The picture that shows in the display window was very blurry and I often saw this at the stores for less money than what I paid. I am very dissappointed with the bang for my buck.
3,Good but be aware,"I bought this for my six year old cousin for her birthday and she loves it, but when the batteries die all pictures are lost."
1,very bad camera,"This camera is terrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. The battery door doesn't stay closed, and every time it opens the batteries fall out and all the pictures are lost. As I type this, I'm exhausted from a very long day at the zoo where we had to keep visiting the same animals over and over because the camera lost the pictures. I wish I could insert a picture of my daughters' tantrums over her lost pictures--but, you guessed it...the batteries fell out and we lost it! Stay away from this camera!"
2,Dissapointed,"I thought it would be better, there is not as much memory as I thought. I do not recommend this product."
1,Waste of money and horrible technology.,"Forget about the horrible quality of the photos, that's to be expected of such a cheap camera and of course it's difficult to use. BUT to lose the pictures that you've already taken because the batteries (that you had to buy BTW because it doesn't come withthem) died, that's pathetic and makes this camera completely useless and a waste of money."
4,Great transaction,The digital camera worked very well. The price was right and the packaging and delivery time were excellent. Thank you.
3,"Thought it was a ripe off, but...","realized it wasn't made for humans. It focuses a lot on sounds. It has a lot of dog barks inserted artifically, which I guess the dogs appreciate. I sat and watched it with 5 dogs on a rainy/stormy day. The Boxer looked at the screen occasionally. The Shih tzu with storm phobias stopped trembling and started to doze off during the ocean segment. I saw ears perk at different sounds from most. Since I can't ask them, I'm going to assume that it holds some interest for them. I think the training segments totally suck. I don't see how a dog can learn by hearing ""sit....good dog"" repeated for 10-15mins. I would think they would become numb to the words, if anything. I was ready to throw my shoe at the screen to make it stop."
1,Way off,This guy is not a caver. He puts himself in dangerous situations that are easily avoidable. He has no respect for our caves and their preservation. His information simply cannot be trusted.
3,Fuji Q1 Zoom lacks Negative size selection,"This is a 'beautiful' design and takes reasonably good pics. (It IS a point & shoot) but unlike all other APS cameras, it only takes pics in the ""C"" mode (the traditional size prints) NOT in the ""H"" mode (slightly wider) or the Panoramic. Why Fuji left this choice off Boggles the mind. The main reason I use APS is for the ""H"" size prints. I'm dissapointed this feature was left off.Steve DirkxDallas, tx"
4,Paul Hardcastle Hardcastle 1,"Paul Hardcastle has been around for a while, But i think some of his best work was in the eighties. His new stuff is good, but his classic stuff is his greatist,19,Rain forrest,King Tut, That's Hardcastle at his best!"
5,Excellent Intro To Paul Hardcastle/Jazzmasters Music,"Just a wonderful intro. to Hardcastle/Jazzmasters music!!! Not a bad track on this CD and many of the tracks on this CD have gotten air time on XM71! This CD is more on the upbeat side as some of his later work is abit laid back. There is a good mix of music here and a nice one for parties or time with your sweetie....hmmmm! There is also a very nice remake of Steely Dan's ""Do It Again""...has nice vocals and some sassy sax to spice it up abit! If you have been looking into Paul Hardcastle music, this is one to start a collection of his many CD's. My next CD to purchase is Hardcastle III and Ride The ""D"" Train......"
3,too dance-y and complex for my taste,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.Instructor great, as always. Good camera work, music ok, ""backup dancers"" non-annoying.Choreography (I actually call it that instead of ""moves"") too dance-y and complex for my taste. I prefer to either dance or do workout moves (jumping jacks, repeater knees, kicks) and not mix the two. Not worth it to me to learn this level of complexity for the calories burned when I do not even like to mix in dance-y moves in the first place. Also, with the added complexity of the step involved (which I am new to), the likelihood of eating it trying to keep up and learn the moves is, even more, totally not worth it for me.I am keeping it for the blast only premix which is approximately 24 minutes to use as an add on to other workouts for maximum calorie burn in minimum time."
3,"Beautiful, but not the instructional DVD","I had read great reviews about the Visual Melodies Instructional DVD that Hossam and Serena Ramzy created, and couldn't wait to get my copy. However, this DVD is not it. They created a cut version of the instructional DVD with only the performances on it, not all the great instructional information on the rhythms (Rhythms of the Nile CD by Hossam Ramzy is great for this).This is still a great performance DVD as Serena is a beautiful dancer and very enjoyable to watch and they left in the feature of viewing the dances from different angles. I just wish they had made a point of marketing this DVD differently, pointing out that it was a performance DVD ONLY, also named Visual Melodies."
4,"Nice to watch, but wouldn't buy","I rented this from Netflix. It was nice to watch...but really not worth the price being asked. It is worth the rental price...so if you have a Netflix account, be sure to rent it to see if you want to invest the money. The routines are nice to study."
3,Rough around the edges,"It was a little Rough around the edges but had its heart in the right place. Played this to get ready for Red Dead Redemption. A lot of potential in this game, but seemed unfinished."
4,A Good Game for the price,"Gun will give you many hours of fun and captivating gameplay. The overall storyline kept me enthralled, while the constant incentive of achievements kept me hooked. After beating story mode, there isn't much to do in the game except hunt buffalo and ravage nearby towns. Although the storyline is very fun, this game is very boring after that."
5,VERY fun and great story,this game may have dated graphics but the game play is outstanding. I picked it up for 20$ and play it non stop a must play for someone who likes shooters and western games. Also has a great story.
3,very fun but too short and too small,This game is very fun but the map is too small and the game is to short and not enough side missions. I really liked it and would recommend it for under 10 bucks or as a rental.
5,excellent,"Game is a little lame at start, shooting indians, then at the end have to make-up, (with the indians) but over all was an adventure."
4,Great game would not pass it by in a heartbeat :-),"A GREAT STORY, GREAT GAMEPLAY, GREAT TEXTURES,GREAT WEAPONRY, GREAT CHARACTERS, YOU WOULD BE A FOOL NOT TO GET THIS GAME! AND A BLIND MAN NOT TO KNOW THE AWESOME THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THIS GAME. I RATE WITH 4 OUT OF 5 STARS FOR THE GREATNESS BUT ALSO SOME MINOR FLAWS BUT NOTHING BIGG! SO DEFINETLY GET THIS!"
1,This game totally sucks!!!,I tried playing this game. But if you can't win the horse race in the beginning your stuck and will never be able to play the game or find out what the story is. This is really stupid. All their trying to do is show you how to ride your horse. But then they say you have to win an impossible horse race in order to play any further into the game. This really kills the game and makes it absolutely useless. I'm selling it back to Gamestop and and spending my time playing games that were meant to be fun. I don't know that was going on in the minds of this game developer.
3,too short,the game was definitely too short to buy. fun game to rent but i beat it in just a few days.
5,Excellent characters and story,"I am a big fan of Robert Louis Stevenson, and I think that ""The Master of Ballantrae"" is his best novel. It has interesting character studies and its exciting story is set in a great variety of locations. It has good adventure plus a very haunting quality to it, and is one of those books that I enjoy re-reading."
2,i rock ur world,"i dont actually own this gun but a friend of mine bought it and unlike the picture it does not come with a scope or even iron sights just some crappy rail that is useless unless you buy a good scope. then about two months after they got it the bolt jammed and it would not even cock and they have still been unabled to fix to this day. This problem probably wouldn't happen to you(the buyer), but from personnal experience with the gun i would not buy it for myself"
4,Great gun!,My son ordered this for an airsoft war he was planning with some friends. It arrived within several days and everything was just as expected. Thanks for a great transaction. He and his friends had a blast!
4,Great Gun,"This gun is fantastic. Everything about it is great. Except one thing. Do not break the trigger box. They are impossible to get a replacement (I've been searching for over a month). Just keep that part safe and this is one of the greatest guns ever. I've used the shadow ops sniper, it is huge and bulky, horrible to use except from one spot. Definitely recommend getting this gun instead!!! Deadly accurate with theLeapers Golden Image 3-9x40 Scope, Illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle, 1/4 MOA, 25mm Tube, Weaver Rings, Rubberized Exterior. Defiantly recommend getting the scope too. for more info go to the leapers website (FYI: UTG is made by leapers)"
1,Never got it!!!!!,I never recieved this item in the mail. It's been 4 weeks now... i would not suggest buying this item from this carrier. I bought it at my local sports authority though and it's been pretty good. The bipod mount underneath the barrel broke off in a game though so that sucks. Make sure you buy a rail adapter for the rail unless you feel like sanding it down 2/7 cm... my scope didnt work on it and neither did any of my friends. Does not come with iron sights so make sure you buy a rail adapter
2,Expensive Book,"Overall I find this book to be not worth the $. The book is small and pocket size with mostly already known information. The information is good for a beginner. It is a good book, but not worth the $."
2,sparkie receiver,"I purchased this receiver for my speakers that are installed in my ceilings and outside on the patio. From the 1st day I have had the system it would turn off if I turned the volumne up, I had to play the receiver on low volumne. 2 days before Christmas 2006 I had company over playing music the system shut off, I turned it back on and it started sparking in the rear. I contacted the company who installed the system and complained about how hot the system would get then turns off. The receiver doesn't have a fan in the rear to cool the internal parts. It had to be shipped off to be checked, I'm awaiting the company's findings."
4,A good if inconsistent work,"Aside from a small publishing blunder (the first 30 pages of my copy of The Dictionary of Modern Anguish were out of order), this is a compelling book of short fictions. Definately not your momma's stories. Most of them masquerade as reviews of films that have never been made or books that have never been written. Berry, at his best, wraps an excellent story around literary theory to create a nice pill that's easy to swallow. ""A Theory of Fiction,"" ""Torture!"" and ""Knott Unbound"" stand out in this regard. Some of the stories are uneven, however, failing to satisfactorily mix intelligent discourse with an experimental impulse. So when Berry is good, he's very good. When he's not, he's just okay. I'd recommend this book for anyone interested in American experimental fiction, critifiction, or needs the number for professional justifications (paid advertisement, page 130)."
2,"Very uneven, but also sometimes wonderful","I agree with the first reviewer; it's a very uneven collection. There are many promising premises; one begins ""Among the novels I will never write...""And there are some wonderful prose poems, such as ""Pretense,"" which are more or less in the manner of Barthelme (and, more distantly, in the manner of Borges (or, although this a long shot, in the manner of Lem (or, ultimately, even more distantly still, but really more plausibly, in the manner of Kafka's one-page stories)))."
5,charger,"Installed and works as stated, just pull up and plug into the outlet. No worries. beats dragging battery chargers and connecting them up."
2,Radio Noise,"The Guest 2611A Charger generates a large amount of radio interference.This charger should not be installed on a boat with a marine SSB radio.The noise from the Charge will be very loud on the Marine HF SSB radio.The manual that came with the charger stated some limitations on the size of the battery that the charger should be used with.If you are considering this charger, before buying this charger, you need to first determine if Guest recommends this charger for your battery size."
3,connecting cords are too short,"Overall the product is a well built charger. The problem lies in the fact that in most fishing boats the batteries are not within 4 feet of each other. It becomes a hassle disconnecting the front battery to make it reach. Also you need to be aware that you must complete the cycle, both cords to one battery or hook up both batteries. If you don't do this it will drain the battery."
3,It's ok,"This book is pretty descriptive in all aspects, But the illistrations are poor.If your curious about what it's like to be intimate with eachother, I would have to say, Shop around for a better book."
3,SEX AD ABSURDUM,"Fifty or five hundred years from now, some archeologist of knowledge will unearth ""The New Joy of Gay Sex"" and marvel at its utter weirdness. Its sequence of subjects (Fetish ... Fidelity ... Finding a Physician) will suggest authors who are either mad or possess a very dark sense of humor, while its illustrations will project a bestiary of beefy humanoids with remarkable tumescence. The archeologist will wonder: for what race of creatures could such a manual have been intended?We don't have to wait to wonder. It's for us. Read it and shriek.""The New Joy of Gay Sex"" is not so much about enjoying gay sex as surviving it. Inevitably, the specter of acronyms casts a certain pall across once-joyful texts detailing the fine points of rimming, scat and glory holes. When the first ""Joy of Gay Sex"" appeared in 1977, the worst its readers had to fear was Anita Bryant and the purple prose of Edmund White. Now we need a degree in medical technology to make it to the second date."
2,very very very tame,"This book is a start....but with the advent of the internet, you can find much better (written, produced, looking, defined) material else where....The author completely misses the 'non-mainstream' parts of the leather community..(bears, etc...)Maybe a 3rd edition is in the works?you can find better...."
1,Golfwits - Maps no longer free,"Buyer beware. I purchased this last month and was having fun with it until the folks at Mapwits began charging for course downloads. Reviews I read here indicate that over 4000 course maps are available for free -- not true. I emailed them and received some gobbedlygook about focus group recommendations to charge, etc. Seems like their whole pricing structure is changing."
1,"Very good Item, if creator hadn't shut down website","There is no way to download courses for this product now, I paid for multiple course downloads and now the site is defunct and I only got half the course I paid for."
1,Fraud,The product is not working. I sent numereous emails to support without success. The website loads whenever. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.Used on Treo 650
2,Inaccurate Course Descriptions,"This is a terrific tool but some of the course maps had outdated information. For example, Phantom Horse Golf Course was remodeled 2 years ago but the information in Pro 2.0 still reflects the old layout."
2,"EXPENSIVE,... even the free download is expensive!","I initially wanted to purchase the software for my palm. At $40-50 it's a little more expensive, but the way they analyze seems worth it. Til I saw the real costs, the maps are not free! They costs $10 each, and if not made already, $20 each. One map can cost more than some of the other golf softwares out there. They do have Mapwits software, which with some effort on your part create your own maps, but it's only available when you buy the pro bundle, $90. If creating your own maps is a bit much then the costs can be very high (pda software $50 then adding approximately 12 maps, as much as $90-180 more, totaling over $200). To be fair they do have a lot of maps. They also have a free download version, but you can't test it without buying maps, so ""free"" is not free! I'm not rich nor lazy, so I'll reconsider them when Mapwits is included with the softwares or available for PC and inexpensive."
2,"GolfWits review - OK for one, hard for more...","I've tried to use GolfWits a few times and I've found it hard to use when trying to keep scores and statistics for more than me. While the maps are nice, they are somewhat cumbersome to use as you need to click on the exact point where your ball landed. This isn't very accurate on handheld screens as they are relatively small. I would pass on this application for now."
3,Not like picture,"I bought this for my 5 year old to wear on halloween. We bought the one ring on a chain, and a sword. He really like it but it does not include the brown jacket in the picture. People still got it but we assumed it would be a bit more for the price."
4,A nice collectible item,"I bought this because I like Pirates Of The Caribbean stuff. This is a nice novelty item to have and will no doubt increase in value over time for collectors of such items. Having said that, I wish the storage compartments were a bit larger to be able to store CD's. The compartments aren't very deep so they won't hold much other than some coins or rings. It would have been even nicer if it was also a radio too. It's nothing great as a CD player is concerned, very basic. But this is a cool novelty item to have and I will enjoy showing it off to friends.I give it 4 stars for being the unique item that it is. I would have given it 5 stars if it also had a built in AM/FM radio and larger storage capacity.It also allows you to hook your MP3 player up via a port located in the front of the chest. I haven't tried this out yet, but thought I'd mention it anyway.Wouldn't it have been extra cool to have provided a remote control shaped like Jack Sparrow's compass to go with it!"
2,Cute but...,"I bought this cd player for my boys, as they have a pirate themed room and thought it would be a great addition. Right out of the box it was skipping and the sound quality was poor. Maybe it was a faulty product but next time I will just skip the ""cute"" and go for something more practical."
3,Fun Game,"I was given this as a gift, the little ones like to get me games to play on my new computer, and it was a lot of fun. I recommend it."
2,Hoyle Card Games 2005,"The content of the program is good - a lot of good games - easy enough to use. HOWEVER, the software has some bugs in it. The proper number of cards is not always dealt correctly to the players. The biggest problem is in the game of Spades. Consequently the game being played cannot be completed. I have used the repair function but it has not solved the problem"
4,interesting,Very interesting game you know when there going to win and when there trying to keep it close. And the Canasta if you win 15 to 20 in a row you can hang it up there cheat with the best of them. who every made this game need to thing less computer more Human.
1,disappointed,"Unfortunately, I was unable to load this cd on my desktop system because it informed me that the cd was for hand held devices. I really would like to purchase a hoyle cd like this one that I could load on my desktop computer. Any suggestions?Thank you, Lavern Rice"
1,Bridge is Terrible,I bought this game package so I would be able to improve my Bridge skills and I very disappointed. The bids (opening and responding) made no sense at all -- even for a novice. An example -- an opening bid of 2 NT with 10 points and a six card suit.I would like to give the package a rating of minus 5 stars but that is not allowed. Net -- I would not buy this package again.
1,Laptops and Tables are NOT Supported,"I travel a great deal, so I purchased this product to use while I'm sitting in airports and hotel rooms. My issue was that I don't travel with a CD player, so I couldn't load the disc as the program starts. When I called their technical support, they told me that (a) that copy protection can't be circumvented and (b) laptop and tablet devices are not supported by their product.To quote from their support site at: http://support.encoreusa.com/product.asp?id=2091, ""(2) Laptops not supported""So for me the game is absolutely useless."
2,Could be a lot better,"There are several programming errors. As an example it doesn't savethe settings consistently so you will have to constantly reset it to your preferences. The game play is below average and there are not enough game specific options. For a simple card game program that Hoyle has updated for many years, it falls short in quality. I expected a much more refined product. My suggestion is to look elsewhere."
2,Not so good....,"The games we bought this for are Hearts, Spades, and Rummy. The first two have opponents / partners who play very poorly - we're amazed in Spades how your partner cuts you as much as your opponents and they can't play nil hands!! In Rummy the oppoenent ALWAYS gets three Kings - never lay one down.The worst part of the game is the mouse buttons. You cannot change them and they're backwards! Also you have to drag the cards to lay out (in Rummy), not quick way to do so, and if you dont place them exactly where the box is they return to your hand.Overall very frustrating and mildly entertaining. With a little more effort and a programmer / designer who had actually played the games this could have been good."
1,Don't waste your money,"Most of the people involved with programing this game seem to have been dedicated to making it as irritating, unenjoyable and predictable as possible. Solitaire seems to consist of anly a few variations; only the values of the cards dealt change. After a while you come to know which game you'll win. In poker the players do really clever things like check with a straight and raise with high card."
4,A good collection of application oriented excercises,Hal Saunders offers a good collection of application oriented exercises. I have used these in my classroom as an addition to my typical class instruction. I appreciate the parallels he provides between mathematics and the world of work.The poster is a great classroom addition as well!
5,NICE,"My brother-in-law is a big UGA fan and this was something he didn't have, so I decided to add it to his collection."
2,poorly written,I was not impressed with this book. I didn't feel that the writing was very well done. The descriptions and development were lacking for the characters and the location of the story. I didn't feel that there was much of a rising climax that led to the climax. I think overall I just didn't like how simple the book was. I like a light read but I didn't feel like the book was very creative.
4,"Not as good as the others, but still good","This one had a lot of page-space from the young man's perspective and frankly it was a little hard to read. I almost put the book down. It ended up being a decent book, one I enjoyed, but the first third was tough going. Still, the story's nice and you need to read it if you want to keep up on the Carolina Cousins."
3,A meeting of Cultures,"He's shown before with a cricket ball in his hand that you never back against Brett Lee, I diverge however. This album and video specifically carries an important message that love can carry across race, culture and age, now I don't know about you but I think that's a message worth getting out there. Musically this will sound weird to Western ears but it is classic Indian pop that everyone can enjoy. Brett has some serious work to do on his vocals but his charisma, charm and driving marketability easily carry him through. Asha Bhosle is all class and I'm sure she enjoyed working with Brett Lee. You go girlfriend!"
5,Another great book from Dr. Luhrmann!,"If you want to know how to write an ethnography, this is definitely a good book to model after. Great book and I really enjoyed it!"
1,High Strength Acetone,Title says it all this stuff is nothing more that high strength acetone .You can get it at any hardware store for a fraction of the price.
3,"Limited Edition...YEAH, RIGHT!!","Okay, first off, I'd like to say that I do like this game. It's not great, and it's not the best game ever made, but it's still fun.That being said, this is a rant on the seller. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION FROM THIS SELLER! THIS IS NOT THE LIMITED EDITION! Go back to the search and just get the regular Path of Neo for XBox for $5.00, because that's what this is. This is not the Limited Edition. There's nothing limited about it. Oh yeah. And the other thing. This is also used. the $5.00 is brand new. How's that for misleading??Get the game. It's a lot of fun. BUT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, DON'T GET IT FROM THIS SELLER!"
1,falls apart,"For less than a dozen uses over several weeks, this is a good coffee maker--then the glass container separates from the base and it is useless. Joe's Coffee does not respond to calls about it."
4,Coffee Bean Roaster- Fresh Roast,"Product is excellent and easy to use and clean. It is smaller than I expected, holding only two measures of beans per roast. I have been using it to do two loads per week and am happy with the results. Will pay for itself in savings that green beans have over roasted in several months."
1,"Joe's Coffee House, Don't Buy",I am giving this a one star because the designated seller for this page is Joe's Coffee house. They shipped me a used unit that was described as new and was also damaged before it was shipped from what I can tell. The unit broke after the first use. The manufacturer informed me that Joe's is not a direct buyer of this unit and they did not know where they were getting them from. They were however kind enough to fix the unit for me although I have still not received the unit in the mail from them yet.This unit only roasts 1/3 of a cup at a time and not the 3 ounces that is described on some of the pages on amazon.
4,Good First Coffee Roaster,"Best Product in this category for the price. It Does creat a significant amount of smoke and can only be used indoors if you have a very good ventilation system. Produces consistant results, and is very simple to use."
1,Better Off with a Corn Popper,"I just went through my second one of these and each of them only lasted one year with weekly use. I would roast the two ounces at a time, fifteen minutes apart, until I had a weeks worth--about a pound once a week. I've done the same thing previously with a corn popper that I bought at the thrift store for 3 dollars, and three of them have also only lasted one year. I bought the Fresh Roast in hopes that it would last longer than the one year that a used corn popper works, but it didn't. Considering that the Fresh Roast roaster can't be had for less than about 80 dollars, the corn popper is a much better deal."
2,"It does make roasted beans, that's about it!","I've had two of this product and really the only reason I bought the second one is I got a good low price. The machine is poorly made and the timer and the settings is a joke. The first machine burned up when the timer did not shut off. I'd recommend watching it carefully. My first machine lasted two years and that was infrequent use at that. I fully expect the second machine to last no more than the first because, if anything, it is worst made than the first."
1,Fresh Roast Ripoff,"I would not buy this coffee roaster. I first purchased one a year ago, and the whole base cracked down the middle within 6 months. It was nearly impossible to get the manufacturer (Fresh Beans, Inc.) to honor the warranty, but it reluctantly shipped out a new model (after accusing me of ""abusing"" the machine). The second unit never worked properly, and I had to work through the Better Business Bureau to try and receive a refund. The manufacturer told the BBB they would refund my money. I returned the unit, and I am still waiting for my refund (it's been 5 months!)."
5,Setting the record straight,"To read mactans' review of the book with its glowing quotes by the trial judge (see his review with quotes from the judge), one would think that Irving won his suit. He didn't. Just as Irving selects bits of source documents and claims they absolve Hitler and the Nazis of the atrocities they are accused of, mactan gives only part of the story. Remember, Irving sued Lipstadt. He not only wanted damages, he wanted HER BOOK REMOVED FROM CIRCULATION. Talk about a dangerous precedent. Lipstadt did not say that Irving should not partake of his first amendment rights. As far as I know, she did not call for his books to be removed from library and bookshelves. Irving apologists want to frame the case as a dangerous attempt to sqaush a valid interpretation of history. Coming to different conclusions based on historical source material is not the issue here- misrepresenting source material to support a pre-existing bias or prejudice is. The same is true for book reviews."
5,A brave book by a brave woman.,"Deborah Lipstadt is an outstanding and courageous scholar. When she wrote her book, Denying the Holcaust, she dissected the work of David Irving, a bigot masquerading as an historian. Irving sued her and her publisher for libel in a British court in which the burden of proof in a libel case is on the defendant. Dr. Lipstadt desribes in great, and at times, horrifying detail her the five years spent in preparaton for the trial and the trial itself. She and Penquin Publishers won, and the judgment forced Irving into bankruptcy. The lesson to be learned is that the only way to combat evil is to confront it. The writing is so vivid and chilling, that at times I had to put the book down for a few moments to regain some sense of composure. We owe a debt to Professor Lipstadt for her dedication to the truth, meticulous scholarship, and bravery."
3,"Chomsky's views distorted in the ""afterword"" section","The following are his true feelings...QUESTION: I ask you this question because I know that you have been plagued and hounded around the United States specifically on this issue of the Holocaust. It's been said that Noam Chomsky is somehow agnostic on the issue of whether the Holocaust occurred or not.CHOMSKY: My ""agnosticism"" is in print. I described the Holocaust years ago as the most fantastic outburst of insanity in human history, so much so that if we even agree to discuss the matter we demean ourselves. Those statements and numerous others like them are in print, but they're basically irrelevant because you have to understand that this is part of a Stalinist-style technique to silence critics of the holy state and therefore the truth is entirely irrelevant, you just tell as many lies as you can and hope that some of the mud will stick. It's a standard technique used by the Stalinist parties, by the Nazis and by these guys."
1,BORING.....MEANINGLESS.....DETAIL.... wake me when it's over,"The author seems desperate to convince with a huge quantity of boring, tedius, very selective information. The trouble is that quantity is not quality, and in this regard the book is severely lacking.Actually the author reminds me of a child caught with its hand in the cookie jar, blathering a huge quantity of information offered as excuses - none of which really address the heart of the matter.The book contains large dry patches, reminescent of a menopausal woman, that will be greatly appreciated by even the most severe insomniacs.Although I am finished with the book, I am keeping it by my bedside for just such a purpose."
2,Unoriginal and Irritating,"This unoriginal Spanish film is just another tale of defenseless women being stalked, bullied and tortured by a psychopathic mama's boy. It has some edge of the seat moments, but the storyline is so overdone and the ending is stupidly grim. Boo!"
5,Very enjoyable...,"The movie is more of a thriller than a horror. It isn't anything earth shattering; however, it is very well done. The acting, pacing, camera work and story line work extremly well and create a suspensefull mood.Julia's sister gets murdered and she is the only one who thinks something is wrong. As the story progresses you learn more about Julia's relationship with her husband. Also, that Julia suffers from the same eye disease as her sister and she is going to go blind as well. Things really get moving when she starts questioning her sisters friends and neighbors about her sisters ""mystery man"". I don't want to say too much incase you are considering watching this movie and if I say too much it will give everything away considering the plot is pretty straight forward."
5,Be the Sand....,"Michael McFadden is one of the most knowledgeable, sincere and prolific pro-choice smoking advocates. His book is terrific.Expanding a bit on the contents of ""Dissecting Antismokers' Brains"", written in such a down-to-earth manner, you will find that you have opened a page-turner that sucks you in to learn more about his well referenced subject matter. You begin to feel as if Michael is a friend, talking only to you. This great book reads more like a novel than non-fiction, and holds the reader's attention so well that I have found myself spending hours to re-read ""just one more chapter""...then, another and another. Want to find a book that will really make you think, whether you are a smoker, non-smoker or even hate smoke? Read this book...more than once. It will make you think!Garnet DawnIllinois Smokers Rights"
4,Much better than I expected!,"I'm a nonsmoker but have read other stuff on this subject since my ""significant other"" smokes, and this book stands out as both having an unusual approach and having a lot of real science rather than just arguments. The psychology framework makes sense and the author argues it very well. Highly recommended if you're curious about the whole smoking controversy and want to see a different perspective than most of what you get out there. I'm only giving it four stars because I'd like to see it updated. The author did a good job of looking into the future but I'd like to see what he'd predict now that so much of what he warned about has come true!"
5,Outstanding cure-all,"My mother introduced this cure-all to me after bringing it back from Poland. It is AMAZING for nearly anything (respiratory, digestion, muscular pain, etc). If you have aches and pains, rub this in and it will heat it up and your pains will go away. My friends were hesitant to use it because they have Ben Gay and Eucalyptus...but once I rubbed this in on them, they have been hooked...it works better than anything! I use it mostly for when I am coming down with a cold (which always turns into bronchitis). You rub this on your chest and back and go to bed...you will sleep very very soundly...and by next morning you will feel better. I use it all the time on my children and this is how we have been able to avoid/heal croupe."
3,Target,"Indoor range has to approve before using, because mask. Great target for indoor shooting would recommend to other shooters who understand importants of quality shots."
1,"shooting on black, you see nothing!","you can not see your bullet holes.. lesson learned.. do not buy black! and paper too thin like others have said, flaps around. I ended up turning it around to a blank white side and put target stickers on it.. will not buy again"
5,can't beat the price,"Great targets, uses the same stock as the targets at the range, but cost only a fraction of the price! I use these for shotgun practice and they work great. I go through targets like crazy and needed something cheap. This does the trick."
4,Background matters,"The background at the range I usually shoot at is black. That makes it tough to see where your shot went when the target is dark like this one. For me, predominantly white targets are the most useful. They don't look as menacing, but I can see where my last shot went.The instant feedback is important if you want to improve as a shooter, so keep the backdrop color in mind when buying any target."
5,Fabulous targets!,These targets met every expectation in size and quality. The paper is heavy instead of pulped. I will be buying more!
5,"Great Price, Targets vey detailed with major body organs.","Shipped quick. Real quick! 5 days faster than origanly told. That was nice. Targets show great detail with the addition of major body organs in gray scale so no to overtake the targets main objective. Paper is good quality for outdoor/indoor ranges. I have no idea why some people reviewed paper as being too thin. Who knows how they are hanging targets? Target held up my Taurus Judge SSR both with .45 Long Cold and .410 triple ott buck shot ammo. All-in-all A+ and I will purchase again. Thank You, Amazon and Sportsman Guide. The 10% discount code from Sportsman was a nice suprise."
4,Shoot the bad guy!,"Nice size, fits most silhouette/frames with little to no folding. the only down side is it is hard to see some of the holes after the shot, no problem with 40 & 45's. LOL! General outlines of Brain, Lungs and Spine. they are not too visible from 10m. The RangeMaster said ""That guy looks like my neighbor"", ""I hate that guy"", ""Let me have one of those"". ROFLMAO"
3,U GET WHAT U PAY FOR,"NOT THE BEST COPY QUALITY, NOT THE BEST DETAIL...IT IS A BIT TOO DARK .....KIND OF HARD TO SEE INTERNALS EVEN AT READING DISTANCE....PAPER WEIGHT IT VERY GOOD ... THE PRICE IS GOOD."
5,big hit,"these targets were just what I needed to help with my target practice on self protection.I also appreciate the fact that my wife can now practice on lifesize-lifelike targets to get an appreciation of what it may be like to have to confront an actual human adversary.this will,I'm sure,improve both our shooting skills and prepare us for the possibility that we may have to defend ourselves at some time.the anatomy outlines are very usefull to see exactly where you're shots are being placed and help in controlling you're aim"
3,Just ok,These targets are black and white and it is very hard to see the penetration points. Even standing in front of the target you have to scan closely to find your hits.
5,Looks Great!!,BEST VALUE EVER... Best price and a great product... very good for the range and cheaper also... you can see the image very well and has an outline of some body organs on it (heart lung brain back vertebra) ... works for me at this price... just cant beat it...
4,Decent Targets,"At this price and quantity, you be left wondering why you wasted money buying targets at the range. Great for practicing center of mass shooting. The only down side about these targets is that it is nearly impossible to see your shot placement when target is down range. I recommend placing shoot n see targets over his heart."
3,good for blasting,"It is very hard to see where you are hitting (thats why a 3 not a 5), but if you are just throwing lead down range these are great!"
4,anatomy targets,"targets work great ,my sons and I practice tactical shooting and you know right away who would have died. We set targets up from 100 to 500 yards and head shoot just for fun. love them,great price , everyone else wants 20 $ for 10 targets thanks"
5,Awesome Targets,"The paper is a little thinner than I wanted, but these are great targets. The internal organs can't be seen from even a few feet away, so we put neon colored stickers in key areas. My accuracy has already improved."
5,great deal,these are great and would recommend them to anyone. great for shooting and are really large. if you are thinking about get them
3,love it,the guys at the range got upset with me because everyone wanted to buy my targets from me 2 bucks a piece sold 8 got my money back and 42 left for me worked out great for me.
4,Very comprehensive,"Having looked at many, many landscaping books, I can honestly say this one is among the best. The pictures are beautiful yet practical and feasible. Lots of practical suggestions help modify for your own yard."
4,Kids love tom and jerry.,"Our kids love Tom and Jerry, and they're thrilled to have this in their collection. They watch it several times a year."
1,Pass on this,"My son (4 yo) loves Tom and Jerry, but this one sucks to pit it bluntly. The old school stuff is way better."
2,"lame, coasting on old tom & jerry reputation",artwork somehow isn't as fetching. story and action are lame. i'd rather just watch the old cartoons over and over.
1,Not Entertaining,"Tom & Jerry Blast off to Mars cartoon is to silly to be entertaining to 4-7 years olds. Children lost interest after the first 5 to 7 minutes of Tom chasing Jerry and destroying everything in sight, getting hold of a lawn mower that continues to destroy. Astronauts get involved in this chase and continues via space rocket, in space and on the planet Mars. Too long and this Tom & Jerry is drawn by new cartoonist not the original cartoonist, even though the DVD cover picture gives the impression of that rich color & more realistic looking characters they were once known for."
2,Wrong item sent out. Waiting for a refund or newcorrect movie to be sent,They sent me the movie that is formatted for a foreign country. I sent it back and I am still waiting for them to send me the correct movie.
2,Not what I expected,"My son loves Tom & Jerry, but this DVD has been a disappointment. We are going to stick to the ""old school"" Tom and Jerry; not a fan of the newer animation."
5,What I like about the movie cartoon !,I saw Tom and Jerry Blast off to Mars and I tape it from Cartoon Network and I loved watching it ! I love anything with Tom and Jerry cartoons !I am happy to see Tom and Jerry back and I hope many more with Tom and Jerry ! Tom and Jerry Blast to Mars is 20 star cartoon flim !
3,Wrong Size too big,i got this and it was to big for my special 20's harmonica it was double the size.
3,Not what I thought,"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering this, it is nearly twice as long as a typical 10 hole diatonic harmonica, so my harmonica slides around in it, and the case is too bulky to easily carry on your belt cell phone style, I guess for another style of harmonica it mite be good but it is useless to me."
1,Case is way too big for a regular harmonica.,This might be nice for the larger harmonicas but is useless to me. All it does is take up drawer space.
2,Not for harmonicas,This IS WAY TOO BIG for my big river diatonic harp. It does not fit a 10 hole harmonica.I now use this pouch for jewelry :) It is actually pretty good for that!
1,Too Big For Your Typical Diatonic Harps - Read Me First,"I don't have this item but I've read enough of the reviews here. If you're looking for a carrying case for your diatonic harp, I'd recommended purchasing here at Amazon: Hurricane Harps, ""Hot House Blues"", Replacement Harmonica Case for 10 hole Diatonic Harps (ASIN: B0025L5VL0). Since one of my harps came with no case I had to find a replacement -- Hurricane Harps ""Hot House Blues"" Replacement Harmonica Case worked great. So skip this Hohner HP Harmonica Pouch for your diatonic harp."
4,does its job,It holds the harmonica well. Nice and padded so no scratches come to my little harmonica buddy.
3,Read this if you have Special 20 size harmonicas,"For smaller Hohner cases that fit a Special 20, search amazon for ""Hohner HPN5 Harmonica Pouch 5-Pack"". The HPN5's are a sturdy soft case that look very similar to this item, but have a belt loop sewn to the back of the case."
4,Perfect fit,I just wish it came in something besides black. The soft case is nice to protect the higher end harmonicas. It would be easier to find in my kayak gear if it were not black.
3,OK,Nothing wrong but not really needed as the Hohner harmonica came in a nicer box. We will keep it for a kids' harmonica.
2,Too small,"Ordered the pouch as a suggested ""also purchased"" item w/harmonica. Needless to say it is useless - harmonica will not fit - not worth returning."
4,good buy,This was a gift and there are no complaints - he was very happy and is enjoying the instrument.
1,"HP Kills Batteries, Dead.","Not only does this cammera suck a pair of AA's dead in 24 photos (or about 15 minutes of video screen) but the cheep plastic hinge breaks easy under the spring pressure. The photos are okay but not great. The flash is nearly useless unless in pitch dark and the zoom only works with the video screen wich eats battery power fast.Stay away, I have a new cannon and it's great."
1,Battery Guzzler,"This thing went after batteries with a vengence! I even went out and purchased those super-juiced 'digital' batteries and was able to take about 5 pictures before it finished off the brand-new batteries. It does take pictures (for the most part...sometimes for no reason at all, it doesn't take pictures) but they are not clear on the viewing screen and the zoom makes for grainy pictures. It was terrible taking outdoor pictures if the sun shined at all... It washed out every image. This camera caused me no end of misery and I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,"Great, except for the size","This Pharmacopoeia has everything and more: dosage tables for pediatric meds, eye chart, and extra info about medication forms. Ths is good for those physicians like me who use a lab coat, otherwise it may be too bulky for others."
1,"Beware, this book is written in Spanish...","I love Johanna Lindsey, and when I saw _El Camino Del Armor_ I jumped on it. It didn't dawn on me that it might not be in English. Silly me, I just thought that it would take place in Mexico or Spain. DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE! Find some of Johanna's book that are written in English."
3,Halo guide by Sybex,"good guide for itself, but it has no, or has poorly drawn, level maps and multi-player maps for PC release of Halo. my only advice, if you just want level maps, don't bother."
4,"It's ok, I guess.","Ok, I'm not going to lie. This guide is pretty much for Halo fans. This is only one of two Halo: CE strategy guides out there, and the other guide is in color and is more interesting overall. I already had the other guide, but I bought this one just so that I could have it."
3,Excellent portrayal of an urban community,According to Anderson in every community there is an understanding and acceptance with conditions. The individuals meet and commune without crossing the boundaries of each other's territory. The process of social exchange allows them to produce a social order. This is also reflected in urbanization and urban society where groups form extended family to associate their identity with. This sheds light to a lifestyle that some had adapted to and some are quick to frown on.
2,Small & Tight,"Looking for a simple belt pouch to carry a single harp around, and thought this would be it, but I find it very tight and small for comfortably holding a standard 10-hole harp (a Special 20 in my case). Difficult to get the harp out of once it's in."
3,"It's good, worth a listen","While this CD will never earn a grammy nomination, it is good solid CD worth listening to. Mind you, not to analyze or try to find the meaning of life, but just to rock to. Hell, even I thought I was listening to Green Day for a second or two. And Steve Jones played on the record, it is JT's solo CD not Stevie's.His Neurotic Outsiders CD has his voice stronger on the same songs. This Cd was made in 95; he has a new band now called Terroristen. His voice is stronger though his lyric writing is still in the same vein. But nonetheless, you cna still rock to it."
3,John Taylor tries the solo route.,"I feel that John Taylor had great intentions to make a rock album suitable for the 90's. Yet I found out why he didn't sing for Duran Duran. It took me a while to get used to his vocals but trust me, the album grows on you."
3,...But it's *JOHN*,"I must admit that I gave this cd away immediately after listening to it. The music is good, but the vocals are really rough, and the lyrics... But it is John, so I give him an extra star just for the effort."
5,I think that It Is a great CD.,I think that It Is a great CD. I think that John will do just fine with out Duran Duran. I feel that It Is a must have for any John Taylor fan.It really rocks. I love It.
3,Barely literate,"John Taylor's got the stuff as a musician, but whoever decided to let him write his own lyrics should be ashamed of him- or herself. It's surprising that a lyric-sheet was even included--you would have thought the label would want to spare him the embarassment. Having said that, if you're more interested in the instrumental side of rock, this is an interesting album. Taylor's experimentation with feedback and other neat techno tricks is an obvious attempt to prove that his interests and talents exceed the lala-pop boundaries of Duran2, but it's all done well. If you don't require profound, or even coherent, lyrics of your music, this is certainly worth checking out. Otherwise, try the Pixies or Sonic Youth for similar musical effects and a higher reading level."
1,Are you Kidding? I think he stole this song from Dr Suess.,"With such haunting, provocative lyrics as: ""you don't give a damn about goo what do you do?""...""makes you disappear like glue, how do you do?""...""I don't interefere with you, leave me to stew""(I wish I was making this stuff up but these are acutual lyrics) it's a shame he's not writing speaches for George Bush. Ugh..."
4,Bold move for John Taylor,"Let me begin by saying, that this is a tremendous improvement over Johns first attempt at a solo project. (You remember ""I Do What I Do"" from 9 1/2 Weeks.) Although the lyrics leave a little to be desired, the music on this album is great! It is one CD that I can listen to over an over and enjoy more each time. Wonderful CD, well worth listening to as long as you're not looking for the answers to life. Great job John!"
5,ICE KINGS,"Great story! More Mounties should have been interviewed. We enjoyed watching and reminiscing about MSC, Woonsocket,and the Great State of RI. Highly informative, inspirational and historically accurate. Ya gotta believe....God bless."
4,Entertaining Adaptation of Beowulf,"Even after hearing Michael Crichton's commentary on the abridged audio version of this book, I was left wondering just how much is true and how much is embellishment. Apparently, the narrator, Ibn Fadlan, was real enough and did travel to the Northlands around the time period when this novel is set, but Crichton wrote the novel on a bet that he could make an entertaining story out of Beowulf. Personally, I thought Beowulf to be pretty entertaining on its own (even in 11th grade, when I read it), but this adaptation is also a good read. The movie later made from the novel, ""The 13th Warrior"" with Antonio Banderas as Ibn Fadlan is remarkably true to the story, then again, maybe not so remarkably when you note that Michael Crichton was a producer. At any rate, a good novel that can be enjoyed by almost anyone!"
3,"Interesting, but far from Crichton's best","Eaters of the Dead (now retitled The 13th Warrior) is unlike anything else you'll read by Michael Crichton. This short book is written in the style of an ancient manuscript. It is the journal of Ibn Fadlan, a representative from the Court of the Caliph of Bagdad, who is sent as ambassador to the King of Saqaliba as punishment for his indiscretion with the young wife of a wealthy merchant. Fadlan never reaches his destination. Instead, he meets a group of Viking warriors who take him with them on their heroic mission to rid a Northen Kingdom of the monsters of the mist. Part history, part Beowolf, part Grendel, part Crichton's imagination, this is an interesting story told by a master storyteller. However, it borrows far too much from other stories (like Beowolf and Grendel) and the style (which includes lengthy footnotes in very small print) becomes tiresome after a while. It's an interesting quick read, but it's also far from Crichton's best."
5,"Eaters of the Dead was great, so was the movie","I really liked the book, I have read some Beowulf before and it does remind of that particular story. Nevertheless, I still loved. The story is captivating and I was soon sucked in. Micheal Crichton is a great author, I can't wait for to read more of his work. I would recomend this to anyone who loves a great story."
2,not good,"Michael Crichton is writing so bad in this book, he just translates all the manuscript of Ibn Fadlan, an Arab courtier, his daily summary, not so interesting, I would suggest other books. (Jurassic Park, Congo), much better than this. Also, don't expect much from this book, no, don't expect anything other than a boring summary of an embassador. The only cool part is that it has a brief description of the customs and lifestyles of the Vikings in the barbaric North..."
3,What a mixed bag from Crichton...,"An interesting attempt at playing ""what if"" with history. However, the fact that the reader is left with an unclear understanding of what is actually fact and what is fiction left me a bit uneasy at the end of this book. It does offer a fascination peek at Viking life, but it never really grabs you for very long. Try Jurassic Park or Airframe for a first time Crichton read."
3,Nothing historical about it,"The fact that many seem to be continuing the myth that the novel has any historical basis is laughable. The manuscripts he supposedly references are all part of his elaborate hoax, and a well known one at that. This book has been out for what, over 20 years? And its still being advertised as some renowned historical work by Crichton? Simply amazing."
5,"No, this book is based off actual manuscripts","It is!!! I saw Ibn Fadlan in a great explorers book!This book is great, I read it while at a resort in Minnesota, at night, and on the plane flight too. It is absolutely one of the top 3 books I've read! Those would be EotD, Congo, and Salem's Lot"
4,very interesting about norseman way of life,"A great historical documentary of the norseman way of life, as seen through the eyes of a muslim. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to friends."
4,What's all the hubbub about fiction and fantasy?,"I don't understand why everyone is so wrapped up in whether this book is fact or fiction. That's the beauty of it. Some is fact, some is fiction, and it leaves the reader guessing as to which is which. Those who believe that this whole story is fact - I feel sorry for you - should go and read the epic poem of Beowulf (one of the earliest classics of the English language). Those who want to nitpick about which parts are real, and which fantasy - I feel sorry for you too - who really cares? If people want to think that this book is real, let them. Ignorance is bliss, remember? I thought the book itself was done very well, and Crichton really did exactly what he set out to accomplish - blur reality with fantasy."
2,Crichton Disappoints,"I had only read one M. Crichton book before, Rising Sun, and I had loved that book. So going into this I had high expectations and I was severely disappointed. I realize that he was trying to piece together actual documented events and that must be very difficult, but I found the overall work to be poorly developed and lacking in substance despite the copious footnotes."
4,Eaters of the dead 2,"Its good. In corporating history and science, he did a great job. Superb!!! I hope there's a sequel for it.... (^-^)"
2,One of Crichton's lesser works,"First, a note to just about every other review I've seen. This is the page for the BOOK Eaters of the Dead! WHY are you reviewing the movie here? That out of the way, I just couldn't get into this book the way I've gotten into other Crichton books. Having a first person perspective eliminated his trademark cross-cutting, and overall it was a flat and unemotional experience. Numerous things were changed in the movie, but it's no better. I'm glad that Crichton didn't write any more like this. All his other books are gems."
2,Crichton phoned this one in,"If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, ""Eaters of the Dead"" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel. This was mostly a bore. Don't bother."
2,OF COURSE IT'S A BIG HOAX !!!!,"The fact that Crichton tried hard to sell this a a ""true"" history darkens all the merit this book could have. Only greed can explain that, the same greed that make Crichton allowed the publication of a third-class book, ""FIVE PATIENTS""."
2,Seperate the Movie from the Book...,"O.K. the movie was good and all, but the book? Even Crichton himself says that the book was just an 'experiment' in combining historical fact with a mythic heroic storyline (Beowulf). Every review here seems to confuse the book with the movie. The movie was well-written, cast extremely well, and just overall a great story.I read Eaters of the Dead over ten years ago and had a hard time with it (not from a reading perspective, its quite easy to read), because it didn't give enough information to be relevant. The Journal style writing without any significant dialog made it feel flat.After the movie came out, I couldn't remember all that stuff happening so I re-read it. Unfortunately I couldn't get the movie images out of my head while I was reading it, which I think is the problem with most of the reviews here.Anyway, it reads quickly, but lacks a certain depth that the movie made up for."
2,"The Worst Michael Crichton, But still a good book","I thought that this was an execellently written book, but crichton could've done better. I don't reccomend one reads it. The croosing of Fadlan and Beowulf is interesting, but that's about it."
3,I'd Call This A History Lesson,This can't really be called a typical Crichton story as it's laid out like a history lesson with alot of references to where his information came from. Would not read this again.
3,Nice read,"Entertaining. Some sixpence, but the end was not in doubt. I. Think as a glimpse into Viking life, it is fascinating."
4,Great book made into a great movie,"This was a great book. It was entertaining and gave insight into the old scandanavian cultures and their myths, etc.I bought it after seeing the movie The 13th Warrior which was pretty good.I'd definitely recommend this short but entertaining book......."
4,A blast from the 10th Century,This book was very well done. I'm now interested in learning more about the Vikings and what was happening in the world a thousand years ago.
3,Could have been better,"It's an easy read--findished it in two days. Good story that just seemed to plod along. Very liitle action and adventure but the ""history"" which served as the backdrop of the story helped to speed the pace up a bit. Overall, it's not the worst book by Crichton but is no where near his best book--""The Lost World."""
1,Wow was this book bad,"I hafta say, Crichton is by far my favorite author. I love all of his books, but this one was possibly the worst I've ever read. I actually couldnt finish it. I got about halfway through, and I wanted to shoot myself. It is told in the most boring way, and the names are long and hard to remember. I don't understand where this came from really, seeing as how the rest of his books are really good."
1,Book Purchase,Would love to say this is wonderful but I honestly can't. Not because the book wasn't a book I like...it had to do with it being a gift for someone else and I didn't read it. Wish I could be of more help.
2,SILLY & NOT WORTH THE $7.99,"I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS FOR THIS BOOK. IT WAS NOT RIVITING, IT DID NOT KEEP ME READING, I JUST WANTED TO FINISH IT TO BE DONE WITH IT. I ALWAYS LIKE MICHAEL CRICHTON'S STORIES BUT THIS ONE WAS WEAK. THE ONLY THING I GOT OUT OF THIS WAS A LITTLE HISTORY AND THAT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING. WHAT DID I MISS?"
2,Kinda Snoresville,"As a Michael Crichton fan, I have to say that for once, the movie was better than the book. The information was interesting but bogs you down till you find out you've been staring at the same page for 15 minutes while wondering if you started the dishwasher or not. However, the movie was well done."
2,Skip It,"The skinny: (1) Not like other Crichton books. (2) Written as a literary exercise, to see if he could duplicate the feel of ancient narrative manuscripts in dull translations with copious footnotes. (3) He succeeded. (4) You've been warned."
4,The hazy mist-ery...,"I enjoyed this movie in the theatre, and when I saw it was based on a Crichton book, I of course immediately went to check it out. I also study Vikings and Viking culture on my free time, so the subject matter is curious to me. This book is a quick read; most readers can finish it in one day (if not one sitting). In the end, I must say it is a good and interesting story, especially if you like Vikings. Fact? Historical and archaeological accuracy? You decide when you read the ending. Please don't let this book or the movie define Viking culture for you. Do your own research as well."
4,How versatile can a man be?,"Mr. Crichton has in this book shown how adaptive he can be. He deliberately adopts a different style in this book than in the others that I have read and he pulls it off excellently. The idea of writing a story that is originally an actual historical document is impressive in it's originality. The idea of using that psuedo-document as a link to a mythological legend is also impressive. The style was somewhat dry to read, and the fight with the dragon was perhaps the most mundane I have ever encountered, but overall the book was very well done. My chief complaint is that he did not spend enough time developing the Eaters into more than a caricature of Neanderthals, but he did write this book over two decades ago. The battle scenes were not very exciting in the modern sense of the reader/viewer, but were exciting that he had kept to the writing style to which he had committed when writing this story. Over all, read it. And if you can read it before you see it."
4,Eaters of the Dead is an excellent quick read.,"I also came upon this book by accident, and was very suprised I had never heard of it before. Although it is a short book, I enjoyed it tremedously. I have also read rising sun, travels and jurassic park by crichton. More and more I am finding Michael to be a great author/reasearcher. It seems that he often studies the subjects he writes about in depth, especially in this case. For some reason this book reminds me of some of lovecracft's short stories, its not only the arab source for the manuscript but also the monsters at the end. All in all if you have a little imagination and enjoy fantasy type books you will like this. IMHO I think that women would not like this book as much as men might, unless you are into the graphic violence and promiscuity of the viking women. If anyone knows any other books in this vein that they enjoyed please email me. I am reading travels now and enjoying it very much."
4,Action & Mystery = Crichton's Eaters of the Dead,"Micheal Crichton spins a web of intrigue as he relates the tale of Ibn Fadian. Ibn Fadian, on a mission from Bagdad, becomes much invovled with the Northmen people. Ibn finds himself becoming and believing in the Northmen customs eventhough his first experiences were horried of the Northmen. I found this book to be very readable and an intresting book as well. Unlike some books that I have read that caused me to dose off, Eaters of the Dead kept me a wake with all the action. Crichton uses great detail in composing the characters thoughts and feelings, giving you a vivid picture of what's going on. Don't let the title miss lead you, although there is violance and some gore the whole book is not. So if you want to read a 200 page book with plenty of action Eaters of the Dead by Micheal Crichtons should be a top your list."
2,"Agreed, nice try... falls short of good","Ingenious idea to write Beowulf from an outsider/foreign point of view. Crichton starts off strong with wonderful tense and regurgitative viewpoints that can only be describes as ""short"" and ""journalistic"". The style is strange yet highly interesting. And then the style changes abrubtly. It's no coincidence that the first 3 chapters were paraphrased from the acutal Ibn Fadlan manuscritps and the remainder of the novel is Crichton's attempt to copy that style. Although he proceeds with the story at a furious pace, it seems to get lost in his attempt at ""faking"" this ancient prose. Like I said before, nice try....falls short of good. If you want to read something magical, based in history(?), read Beowulf and wonder at the magic of orginality, not originality trying to duplicate magic."
3,"good, even if it was a rip-off of Beowulf","I found Eatrs of the Dead to be a good read, but it didn't take me long to realize that the author was just retelling Beowulf & changing a few of the characters. The only differences, except for the Arab, were the # of warriors, making the king's jester into a prince, turning the cave-troll Grendel into the cavemen Vendel, & including the fire wirm as a Vendel attack. That shows that he got the main plot from Beowulf. What was the point of its inclusion. It was still a good read, but the fact that it wasn't an original story line kept me from giving it more than 3 stars."
4,good read,This book reads well but leaves you alittle short in parts. This is the book 13th Warrior was based on worth the read in any rate
1,this is for the Audio Book - not the printed book,"I enjoyed the movie - not a great movie - but entertaining.I like to listen to audio books at the gym and thought this would be fun.I was sadly disappointed.Many of the first tracks was irrelevant and tedious, and discussed the authenticity of the original manuscript and copies. This went on and on and on. I found myself first fast forwarding, then just skipping sections.Once I got to the actual story I continued listening. Except it too was dull. It was more of a lecture than an enjoyable experience. After 30 minutes of fast forwarding and skipping I put it aside. I think it's unlikely I will resume listening to it, and will keep it for an emergency on my MP3 player. I may try it again, but I'll probably end up deleting it.Good thing it was a library copy and I didn't pay for it."
1,Boooooooring!,"This was one the worst books I have ever read. The characters were lifeless, the story lame, and the ending simply awful. I would give it less than 1 star if I could."
1,ECK!,"I don't know how this book got such great reviews. the plot, characters, and development were horrible! It was a waste of time and one of the 5 worst books i have ever had the misfortune to read."
1,Hmmmm...,"In Michael Crichton's own words on his website he states: ""Note From Michael: The story behind this novel appears in an essay in the paperback edition. The short version is, I wrote EATERS on a bet that I could make an entertaining story out of ""Beowulf."" It's an unusual book. Readers either like it, or they don't.""I didn't. No wonder it was on his professor friends' list of ""The Great Bores"". Michael Crichton had a chance to give it life, yet it still reads just as boring as the original Beowulf. The one fun thing about it was all the ""fake"" footnotes and sources that he inventively quotes. He was very creative with it and for that I give him a star. ;)"
1,Without A Doubt Crichton's Worst!,"Eaters Of The Dead was so boring that I seriously thought about never finishing it and putting it down to read Cujo by Stephen King (Great Book). But I finished, and I thought that it was an accomplishment. When I bought Eaters Of The Dead I had already read The Andromeda Strain and The Terminal Man, which were two great Crichton novels. Boy was I shocked! Oh well, don't worry Michael every author has a bad one!"
1,Terrible,"I found this book the worst book I have ever read. I read it as'Eaters of the Dead' a horrible title. At least the new title isbetter. The style is a attempt to recreate the style of an original 10th century manuscript simply boring. The only reason I got through it was because it was so short. It will probably make a good movie because it's so simplistic. Anyone who thinks this was not fiction well, there's a sucker born every minute."
1,boring,I found this and Sphere to be two of his worst books. Neither held my interest and I usually like anything he has written.
5,Historically Fascinating,Crichton has done a wonderful job of retelling the story of Ahmad Ibn Fadlan's adventures in 922 AD. A fantastic book for any Crichton Fan.
5,Favorite Book,"One of the best books i ever read along my life, this book was given to me by my father when i was 13 years old, you know when you're a kid you have a more spicy imagination and when i read it i saw all the images of IBN, BULWYF and the rest clear crystal and wonder why nobody did a movie about the book...but there's the movie with Banderas, not so exciting as the book but fair enough to get the glimpse of what i read 17 years ago."
5,( :,"I loved the book! It was delivered very fast!I recommend this sender, I read the book in an hour and a half so it was good entertainment for the few dollars I paid!"
4,"Something borrowed, something new","Michael Crichton started with the barebones of a 10th Century manuscript and created a fascinating story. He borrowed elements of Beowulf, the Seven Samurai warriors (Magnificent Seven)and evolving anthropology/genetic science in his story. In the introduction he tells us how he came to write the book on a dare by a friend, and elaborates on his research. I found all of this as interesting as the story itself.The movie The 13th Warrior was poorly reviewed and poorly received by viewers, but the book despite the gruesome title is worth the read...but be prepared for the randy lifestyle of the Northmen.Other reviewers have summarized the story itself. What we rarely get to learn is how well known writers come to create the stories they do. This book enlightens."
4,EATERS OF THE DEAD,"This book was great, but not as great as some of his others. It is not even close to Sphere and Disclosure. I think Michael Crichton is one of the best authors ever to live."
1,This book sucks a big one,"I normally love this author's books, but all this book was, was one long boring narrative. I might as well as read a school history text.thumbs down."
4,crichton leads,It's one of my favourite books. It is written in a very good style and I think that everybody should read it.
4,Very well written,"Excellent work by Crichton who seems to have found his groove in writing historically based novels. Much better than Great Train Robbery or Andromeda Strain. As usual, the book is better than the movie, but the cinematic adaptation was still a great work."
5,I really enjoyed it...,"This is the first book by Michael Crichton that I have read, and I loved it. In the book, basically, an Arab man in about 925 AD was forced to become an ambassador to a foreign country, and shortly after arrival, is captured by Vikings. With the Vikings, he goes on a mission to save a village that is being plundered by a civilization of cantabiles. This was a really good book that I would recommend to all who enjoy action.I would give it a 9/10."
5,The Ultimate Culture Shock,"""Eaters of the Dead"" is about a 10th Century Arab Muslim named Ibn Fadlan, who goes on a mission to deliver a message up in the northlands by the King of Saqaliba from the ""City of Peace."" Fadlan gets sidetracked and finds himself among a bunch of Vikings. He observes the Viking way of life and finds much of it offensive, because it goes against his beliefs. Fadlan and the Vikings go around the northland on adventures. They come to a city and protect the village from the ""Mist Creatures"" who tear off people's heads and take them away.This is an excellent book which shows what culture shock would be for a 10th Century Muslim in the ""Barbaric"" northland. I highly recommend this and I give it five stars."
5,Ibn Fadlan lives through Michael Crichton!!!,"Ibn Fadlan is a Scribe in Super Hero tights and Michael Crichton brings him to you!!! This book has got to be one of the Greatest!!! Buy it, Borrow it, Rent it, Steal it!!! Get this book between Yourself and the World and you'll come out of it smarter, wiser with a fresher look at the World."
3,refreshing look at vikings and Beowulf,"It took a while, but I finally got into Crichton's ""eaters of the dead"" and enjoyed it. Sure, Beowulf predates the 10th century vikings in the story, but I give him high marks for his interesting synthesis of an old manuscript and an older epic legend.A real drag to the story flow was the overuse of footnotes. Since liberties were taken with time and facts, why not incorporate the footnotes into the main body of the story and keep it flowing? Crichton does have an eye for action.I cannot imagine this story as a movie starring Antonio Banderas, however it was a good, mercifully short read. They can't all be Andromeda Strain."
2,Rather Disapointing,"After reading many of Mr. Crichton's works, I found that this book was truely disapointing. I had trouble reading it, and had to look up practically every other word in the dictionary. After the first thirty pages, I felt like putting it down, but resisted. Now, I kind of wish that I had. It got a little bit easier to read, and the plot developed more after about 45 pages, but that was not even close to being enough to make it one of my favorites. I do realize, however, that there may be many readers out there who enjoy reading a novel with Shakespereian style writing (is that even a word?) and I do recomend it for them. It just was not really ""My cup of Tea"" as they say."
2,"Not great, but not bad","The Movie was very entertaining, the book was very dry and slow reading, Please DO NOT take this book, or the movie as a true showing of the life of the Muslam, or the Viking. In Michael Crichton's postscript, he states that it's a work of fiction. In an interview, he said he was attempting to bring the legend of Beowolf to life. Read the book if you like, but enjoy the movie."
3,misguided... bad history,I missed this when it was first published... the title turns one off!But more than this Neanderthals in an Earth Mother fertility- dead eating scenario at 900 AD is just very unlikely.The characterization of Viking culture ( or seeming lack of it)is faulty from an historical point of view with open [...] sexbeing depicted as usual or common among Vikings.The witch woman and death ritual depicted seem more Indian or eastern than Viking.Despite all this it is an interesting read even if it is badly distorted history.
1,Extremely disappointing,"I have generally enjoyed all of Crichton's novels, but this one was awful. The characters were dull and they were not developed well. The story never really went anywhere. It's a good thing the book was short, otherwise I never would have bothered finishing it. I don't like giving only one star because I have a lot of respect for the author and I've really enjoyed his other works, but it just doesn't deserve any better."
2,Silly & not worth the $7.99,"I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE GREAT REVIEWS FOR THIS BOOK. IT WAS NOT RIVITING, IT DID NOT KEEP ME READING, I JUST WANTED TO FINISH IT TO BE DONE WITH IT. I ALWAYS LIKE MICHAEL CRICHTON'S STORIES BUT THIS ONE WAS WEAK. THE ONLY THING I GOT OUT OF THIS WAS A LITTLE HISTORY AND THAT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING. WHAT DID I MISS?"
2,Eaters of the Dead,"This is not a typical thriller in the Michael Crichton sense.Not at all what I expected. While the writing is very readable, it is somewhat slow. The conclusion is exactly what is expected. Predictable."
4,Beowulf retelling with a twist.,"This is a version of Beowulf with a twist: Crichton adds a chronicler/reporter to the cast of characters who is also an outsider. So we get a sort of embedded reporters account of the Beowulf story. This book is a kind of translation of Beowulf for those not much into literature and poetry which is the majority of people. If you want a good translation in the poetic verse format that is closer to the original I recommend Burton Raffel's. I find verse and poetry to be a much deeper and more full of information with brevity, than this and other modern day prose retellings. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed reading this book, I'm a big Crichton fan in general and enjoyed the new elements that Crichton added. It's more informative, like a news story, but not close to the art of the original Beowulf."
2,More unpleasant prairie shenanigans!,"Larry McMurtry has written some stunning books, particularly in the western genre. This is not one of them. His unmistakeable style was present but he seems to be trying to parody himself--unsucessfully. I read the first book and didn't like it much, and only read this one in a pinch. At times the sections were boring and I ended up skimming over several pages.For me I need to find a character to like. Since the characters in this series are mostly vain, self-satisfied and brutish it was impossible to find anyone admirable or likeable. So therefore the rather thin plot of a group of people on a hunt through the American wilderness did not engage me. A disappointment!"
3,worth reading,"I was disappointed in ""Sin Killer,"" the first volume of the Berrybender Narratives. This volume, the second, is an improvement. The characters do not put too terrible a strain on believability, and the melodrama is not overdone. I am hopeful that the third volume will continue to improve, and that the fourth will make the series a solidly worthwhile one."
4,The Berrybenders Blurb,"It's no Lonesome Dove,but I need a McMurtry fix!I love all his characters,especially Pomp,and Little Onion.Read it and get a taste of LD.Can't wait for the next book!"
4,Strong finish,"This is the second in the Berrybender series and like the first, my impression of it changed dramatically and I'm not sure when or why. In both this book and in Sinkiller, my feeling throughout that it was too episodic in nature as to almost be disjointed and the characters were so unlikeable, I didn't care what happened to them anyway. In this installment as in the first, however, by the end I found I was enjoying the book and contemplating the next installment. The greatest advice I can give about this book is that if you start it, finish it. It truly needs to be evaluated in its entirety."
4,Second in a series,"This is the second in a series of novels about the Berrybender family's adventures in the American West during the mid-19th century. I especially enjoyed listening to the CD version as each part is read in the character's voice, and this book is full of characters. It is especially entertaining to watch the father pursue his two main loves: hunting buffalo and young women. Its not for the faint of heart, with graphic violence and raw language."
3,The Wandering Hill,"This is quite a vivid depiction of life on the frontier and the contrast between the wealthy, spoiled Europeans, the frontier men who fed and protected the Europeans and the Indians. The character development was interesting as the story progressed. All in all it was a good tale with some colorful characters and great descriptions of the wild west."
2,Pointless,"This book was a waste of time. I kept hoping it would get better, that some purpose or plot would develop -- but nothing. The writing is juvenille and embarrassingly obvious. The only point of the book is to leave the reader hanging to maintain interest in the next volume. I have no reason to believe the next book will be any better or worth investing my time."
4,Terrific Zoom,"Great camera, zoom and OIS. Manual not great at all. With good lighting indoors using the party mode able to take relatively low noise pictures without flash. Printed out a 48X(optical + digital) zoom picture and was quite clear. Can't find option to activate date stamp and was only able to date when printing. You would thnk by now all cameras would have this option because you don't always print all your pictures and its good to have a date when you save the picture instead of printing it. Other than the above no other major complaints."
2,not happy with this,So far 50% of my picutes with this have been blurry.75% of my indoor pics are blurry. I got this to replace my Cannon s110 elph (took great outdoor pics but terrible indoor)and for the digital zoom but wish i had spent 200$ less and gotten the cannon with the 10X optical zoom instead.I think panasonic has a team of employess paid to write good reviews for its products. Just try to find bad reviews for any panasonic projects - u cant!.I even tried to put a bad review in circuit city's website and each time i tried to submit the website would have a problem -no matter how many times i tried. Does panasonic pay them off not to allow anything under a middle of the road review through?
2,didn't live up to expectation,the camera is too light and way too much shake...photos using the zoom are not clear enough to reproduce...especially when in the max zoom mode. good for close-ups and such.
3,Panasonic DMC-FZ5,"I just bought one and am very disappointed to find that a user can not change the degree of zooming when in movie mode; in other words, once you select a focus that includes a certain amount of telephoto zoom, you are stuck at that zoom level till you stop the movie and start a new movie. BUMMER!Secondly, even though everyone raves about the image stabilizer, I have to say that my old Sony Mavica MVC-FD91 had/has a far superior stabilizer.The new Canon S2 may be the way to go.http://www.dpreview.com/news/0504/05042201canons2is.asp"
5,great long zoom camera,"I just had to buy this camera, I tried it and the stabilizer for long zoom works great, I use hand held only and everytime I take pix even with a long zoom, the picture looks sharp, and color is great. The best is the price for a 5 megapixel with 12x zoom - only got it for $398.00 in Singapore.It's kinda big (of course) but it's the smallest of the long zoom cameras, flash range is good also, heard it has the best flash range of it's kind."
2,Lens jammed after only a year,"I LOVED this camera, everything about it, until it jammed for no apparent reason after having it just over a year. I've seen other users with the same problem on this website so I guess I'm glad to know I'm not the only one. But, do I buy another Panasonic, do I upgrade to the FZ8, don't know whether I trust them or not which is a shame because as I mentioned it is great - easy to learn & use, takes reliable pictures etc."
2,Hide a key Thermometer,Glass thermometer broke due to sever cold weather here in northern New York. Concept is good.
3,"Good game, bad compatibility","The excitement that was about to explode from within me the moment I received my copy of Escape from Monkey Island (Mac) was impossible to describe in words. However, that excitement quickly became that of sorrow when I realized that this game is not very compatible with OS X 3.The game is playable, but the in-game movies don't seem to like playing. The sound comes out crystal clear, but unless you enjoy being in a simulation of playing a game in a pitch black cave, you'll probably find it as annoying as I did.And to make sure I was not the only one to have this problem I searched forum after forum only to find out that there are many other people suffering from the same ailment.If you're running OS 9 to OS X 2, get the game, it's a definite buy -- funny and smart. If you're running OS X 3, beware of some annoyances that will probably stick its ugly head out."
2,"good info, bad organization","The information in this book is great, but the organization and editing is horrid. I would be reading along and the text would wander off onto other subjects and eventually drift back to where it started.If you have to have this book, try and find another one that makes more sense to your head if this one doesn't."
4,Mainstream 1970s pop from Brazil,"Various Artists""SUPER-POPULAR: ANOS 70""(Mercury-Universal, 2002)---------------------------------------------A good representative 2-CD set of mainstream ""brega""-style Brazilian soft-pop from the 1970s, with tracks by artists such as The Fevers, Odair Jose, Jerry Adriani, Paulo Diniz, Vanusa, Wando, Claudia Telles and Sidney Magal, including many artists who had been part of the jovem guarda teen-pop scene in the '60s.

2,Not worth the money,This toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow the dozen or so chambers up. The instructions were terrible. You have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next. The chambers do not stay inflated and some don't work at all. My son does still have fun with it but I wouldn't buy it again.
2,"Lots of Fun, but did not last","My 7 year old son received the Giga Ball for Christmas. It was a big hit. He and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours. Unfortunately, the very next day, it pretty much fell apart. I didn't expect it would last very long, but had hoped that it would last more than one day."
1,I don't even understand how Kidz Kraze has the nerve to sell this product,I see that one reviewer's gigaball came with instructions. How nice - mind didn't. It took four hours to fill up with a pretty good air compressor because the air leaked out faster than it would fill up. I kept patching holes and new ones kept appearing. It was like the twilight zone. The worst part about it was how disappointed my children were. I will not be purchasing another product from this company. Quality is obviously an alien concept to them.
2,easily punctured,"Length:: 0:15 Minsme, my brother and my sister used our allowance to buy this. the first day we opened it it poped, it lasted mabye an hour. at first only one hole was poped and we thought we just didnt close the valve all the way, then the next few days more and more poped. that was the second one we bought both resulting in the same way. i think it is a total waste of money although it is fun if you roll down a hill in it."
1,Great idea but poor implementation,"We found this to be a great ball ... for the first two hours. After that we noticed several of the seemingly almost 20 separately-inflatable bladders were leaking. The next day the kids wanted to play with the ball again and it required more than 1/2 hour to reinflate it. After that I never had sufficient inclination to spend the time required to reinflate it. Eventually we just got rid of it.But for the many other reviews describing similar leak problems I might have thought I just received a defective one. If you do get one that does not leak please be aware this is a large ball and, as another reviewer noted, because of the many cracks it does pick up dirt/bugs/grass and is hard to wash off. If you don't mind your kids getting dirty and they have appropriate play clothes this ball can be a lot of fun!"
3,Disappointed in construction,"My son received this giga ball for Christmas and after we got it blown up he LOVED it. Unfortunately my (30 lb) son and his (35 lb) friend played in it indoors on a soft carpet and one of the seams popped almost immediatley. It came with some patches but no adhesive to attach them, so I am not sure how to fix it. I came online to find some advice and after reading all the other reviews it seems we are not the only ones to have this very same problem and the bext fix I've seen here is duct tape, which I guess we will try."
2,"Gently used, still split seams: (","It is a pain to blow up even with the 3 diff pumps - very gently used and seams opened as though not really sealed, at least 4 chambers within 2 days. Amazon refunded and incl'd shipping, too, thank the Lord. So if I can find one local (Target?) I'll try again and not have to deflate & reship if it fails again. Tempted to try Hearthsong to see if quality will be better with their 'exclusive' color - hopefully better made!"
4,ball o fun,"Once we got through the test of blowing the ball up the children (ages 6&9) had a great time rolling themselves up and down the hill. Then it came time to put it away and we realized it was so big it wouldn't fit through the door. The children spent the summer with their friends, having a great time in the ball, with some adult supervision especially for the younger crowd. But by the end of the summer the individual sections had started to deflate and come apart. If you have a large open space like a gym or basement it would definitely be worth the investment."
1,Holes in no time!,"My kids were dying to get the Giga Ball. It takes forever to blow up as it is divided into multiple sections that need to be inflated individually. After the first inflation, the nozzles that you inflate through kept popping open and before you knew it, the ball had lost air. Since the kids had so much fun with it, I would re-inflate that darn thing just about every day for it to keep its shape! It's now been 3 weeks and the rips have started. The patch they include seems to do nothing. So it looks like our expensive ball is heading for the trash. Moral of the story - DONT BUY IT!"
1,"Fun, and then........... DONE!!","This is a great toy, for 5 minutes. It is VERY Poorly constructed. It develops air leaks in the seams and there is no way to fix them. My kids got this for a gift and really enjoyed it until this fatal flaw was revealed.What a waste! Please save your money. I wish I hadn't thrown the box away or I'd be returning it."
3,Normally I enjoy this author tremendously. . .,"Stephen White is one of my favorite authors. I buy his books in hardback (a rarity for me), but this one I would have wished I waited for the paperback. Did anyone else notice Alan's (Stephen's) obsession with peeing??? He mentions it numerous times, and I found it rather distracting, and after about the eighth time I just started laughing, and figured the guy must be potty training one of his kids or something!"
2,"Sorry, not impressed","I've now read almost all of the Alan Gregory series, and have liked most of them. This one didn't do it for me. White has said that the next Gregory novel will be the last, and I think that's a wise choice on his part.I particularly didn't like his character development of the ultimate villain, probably because he chose to develop that character in just a few pages at the end of the book.On a side note, if you're new to Stephen White, I suggest you try to read this series in order. White has a nasty habit, in his later books, of lengthy references to characters and events from earlier books. Yes, some authors do that, but White seems to do it more than most, and I find it annoying."
5,Manner of Death by Stephen White,"Love it, I am catching up mid-series. Every book is such an easy read and suspenseful, love the characters!"
2,Interesting References to the Front Range...,"Other than that, I found ""Manner of Death"" a dull read. I found the characterization shallow, the interrelationships between the characters unbelievable, and the premise for the murders -- and who the murderer is -- hard to buy into. There is no suspense to speak of, except for a short scene involving a private plane. If it weren't for the fact it is set in Boulder, CO, I would not have finished it."
2,"If your time is valuable, pass this by!","If you go to the Q. & A. section of White's web page you can read about his not really knowing what will happen in one of his books until the characters reveal that to him during his writing. Manner of Death was a good example of that revelation. The first 350 pages offered little in support of the culmination of the novel. If as a reader you hope to be able to put the pieces of the puzzle together along the way, you are out of luck here. There are no pieces to put together until the very end and unfortunately those that do get put together at the end are not at all intriguing or memorable."
2,Seemed like a shaggy dog tale to me with a punchless ending,"I have read five previous reader reviews and wonder if we all read the same book. I read more than I ever want to about psychology (the central character's internship particularily) and was utterly nauseated by his puppy dog devotion to his earlier lover, Sawyer. Reading about his panting over his upcoming meeting with her after 15 years got tiresome--what a wuss!!I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, but it came out of the blue on page 340 (out of 350 total pages)This book was at least 100 pages too long, and most of those involved his mindless devotion to his earlier lover, Sawyer. Get a life!!"
4,A suspenseful and fun read...,"The seventh book in the series introduces the mystery very early on, and keeps the reader hanging on until the very end. White has once again written a novel full of suspense, with lots of twists and turns. The characters are likeable, especially Sam and Alan. There were a few loose ends or small holes in the plot, but the pace is such that readers don't really have time to notice."
1,I wanted to kill him too !,"I must admit I'm only 1/4 of the way through this book but I'm rooting for the unknown killer to put Gregory out of his (our) misery. He is pompous, arrogant, and condescending to his wife. He knows everything about everything and is skeptical of the FBI agents who are trying to tell him something. I would have said, ""fine buddy, you're on your own"" and let him get fried, drowned, shot or whatever. Like these two FBI agents don't have better things to do then BEG this pompous ass to let them help him. What a wind-bag ! No wonder Sawyer dumped him."
2,Not very helpful,"I bought this book to help me with starting middle school next year. It didn't give me much advice. Most of the things in this book were about how to survive LIZZIE'S school, LIZZIE'S teachers, and LIZZIE'S classmates. This book gives only advice on 3 classes: Social Studies, Music, and Language. If you're going to talk about school subjects, talk about all of them. The study skills were stupid, some of them were: Don't study at the bowling alley, don't study with your crush, and be sure you have all your study materials. Everybody already knows this stuff."
3,Mostly Black-n-white photos,This book is a useful history of mostly modern Western painters/sculptors. It's definitely not an art book in the sense of good color illustrations. If you can get it cheap it's worth buying. It's a reference work only.
3,MY THOUGHTS ON THIS BOOK!,i think so far this book is ok i guess..theres alot of words that make the book kind of confusing ..Although i do recommend that if u read this book with a whole class read individually. I say this beacuse if your not really focused on the book you will get lost in it really quick. But so far i think its ok for only reading one chapter of it..So thats what i think.
4,awsome book,"I thought the book was interesting and it teache me to look at life in a other way and never judge a book by it's cover it'S what on the inside that count and not on the outside,i think harper lee touch a lot of poeple with her book. to kill a mockingbird is a sin!"
5,This book tells so much about how life was like back then!,In this book I thought it was the best book I have ever read because of the way it deals with Atticus and how he handles his trial. If I was going to have to recommend this book I would recommend it to everyone because it teaches you alot! And everything about Boo Radley just goes to show what happens to people when there locked up inside for so long! And I know that it doesn't say it in the book but of course unless your stupid you figured out that Boo Radley was the one that killed Bob Ewell. Well I thought this book definately deserved 5 stars!
2,IT WAS OK..............I GUESS,"I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK CAUSE IT WAS A SCHOOL ASIGNMENT.IT WAS OK,BUT A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND KINDA BORING!"
5,a very good book for the teenager point of view,This book had very good character build ups and very good description. I thought that the relationship between the brother and sister was well written. I liked the ending because it kind of answered the characters thoughts about Boo Radley. The most important theme to me was putting yourself in someone else's shoes or place.
5,One of Jackson's best remixes!,"The addition of Blackstreet to the cut from Janet's ""The Velvet Rope"" lp is a triumph for the artist and listener's everywhere."
3,"OK, but nothing more","Be aware that this is a Limit Holdem Book and NOT a No limit Holdem Book! Having read its descriptions I could not understand that, so I bought it and read it. Of course it's a good book, but better for limit holdem players.Of course it is a bit outdated (at the time of this review, early 2013) but still a fine addition to anyone interested in LIMIT (again, NOT No-Limit) Holdem."
2,not realistic,"Covers much solid theory for for extremely loose limit hold'em. But, don't expect to find tables as loose as they suggest. Many examples are unrealistic.on page 82: loose games average 6 to 8 players to the flopWhen was this true? it certainly is very uncommon today to see a table AVERAGE 6 to 8This is not a good book to get a realistic foundation.To get a well rounded hold'em foundation, see Gary Carson's Hold'em PokerThen for a deep understanding, regularly study Sklansky's Theory of Poker"
4,for my first book,"Its good, they put it out there straight up and on the line for you. they do referense a lot to their other books so if you havent read them then you kinda feel lost on a few things but they have a lot of good points and a lot of good things to learn. its not for beginners so if your looking for a starter book, this is not it."
2,This is not a book on No-Limit Hold'em,"This is not a book on No-Limit Hold'em. I think the title is a little deceiving. It should be called Small Stakes Limit Hold 'em: Winning Big With Expert Play. This book is about LIMIT Hold'em. I am a small stakes NLH player and was looking for a book on NLH. There is a lot of good advice on how to play Limit Hold'em in this book for beginners. However, most of the stuff in this book a good player will all ready know."
2,Only for new players,"If you know anything at all about hold-em this is not the book for you. It does help with learning how to figure odds but everything else it covers can be picked up with a few hands at the table. The book assumes that you are playing with less than mediocre players, and its advice varies greatly depending on how talented your competition is. It is not an easy read."
