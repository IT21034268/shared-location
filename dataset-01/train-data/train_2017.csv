3,Better than clipping nails,This tool is so much better than using clippers on our dog's nails. No bleeding using this tool. I did have battery problems with this one. We started taking the battery out before storing it. It still didn't seem to work the same as when we used the product the first time. We're going to try a different Dremel nail grooming model.
1,Doesn't come with tools,"I bought this thing for my dogs, went to trim their nails and found out there was no toolbit to put the sanders onto unlike what is shown in the picture. No wrench either. Don't be fooled the picture does not show what really comes with it (5 sanders) and they want you to buy the toolbit for extra."
4,Review of Pet Nail Trimmer,"I have Pugs and they are very sensitive to nail trimming. This works very well (I use it on the low speed) and neither of my Pugs seem to mind it. It is so expensive to take them to the veterinarian for nail care, and this was not cost prohibitive."
2,Sucks Batteries,"This worked for about 3 nail trims, and then the batteries started dying. Without brand new batteries, this thing doesn't have enough power for nails. Buy a real Dremel that is rechargeable instead."
1,NOT EASY TO USE,"It doesn't matter what speed you use the sanding wheel wants to jump off the nail. Dogs totally freaked and i tried it on seven(7) dogs. I had ordered two grooming tools, but returned the unused one. Wish I could have returned both. Don't buy."
2,Too Loud for Some Dogs!,"My Pug gets hysterical when I turn this on...it does not sound too loud to me, but it does to a dog!"
2,Lots of patience,"You and your pet need lots of patience to trim nails with this tool. So far, neither of us have said patience. It seems both the high and low settings are exactly the same, and both are too slow to actually accomplish what it is meant to do. I have a Weimaraner with thick nails (like any medium to large dog) and I have yet to see any real results using this tool. I would suggest this only for small animals."
2,Not strong enough,"The motor is very weak and I can only get one speed to work. this happened only after a few minutes of use. My dog doesn't seem to mind it much though, and you EVENTUALLY get the job done."
2,Cheaply made for Pet Use,"I was so excited to use this but so disappointed. Exactly what others wrote about battery dying after one use. Sanding drum is annoying to replace. I also had to use wider drum for my doberman, but for thick nails it takes forever! Not recommended for big dogs, better for smaller breeds.Pros: quiet, portable, cheapCons: weak, eats too much battery, feels cheap."
3,Works well but burns batteries,"I love the functionality but I only get 3-4 uses and I need a new set of batteries. I'd say save up the extra $$$ and buy a regular Dremel, use the sanding drums, that's all this is. Although this is quieter and may be less likely to frighten the dog."
4,This worked pretty well,"I had a female dog who was so afraid of having her nails clipped[not to mention my own fear of trying to use a regular dog nail clipper due to being afraid I'd clip too much off, and hurt my dog's foot in the process!] that a product like this Dremel cordless rotary nail grooming tool really helped solve that dilemma!--it didn't bother her to have her nails sanded down with this Dremel pet nail groomer, so she didn't fight my efforts, and I stopped dreading having to even try to clip her nails thanks to this product!--it can take awhile to finally sand the nails down, but this certainly beats trying to use a nail clipper on a skittery dog who is nothing but fearful every time it sees you coming with the regular nail clippers!"
2,not for large dogs with black nails,This tool does not have enough power for large dog black nails. It stalls unless you take very light cuts.
2,my dogs hate this more than clippers,"I bought the Dremel nail groomer based on the glowing reviews on Amazon. I have 2 dogs, one doesn't mind having his nails clipped and the other is terrified at the site of the clippers. I read the instructions and tried to slowly accustom the dogs to the vibration of the Dremel groomer. They were both terrified of the sound and the feel of the tool. It takes awhile to file their nails down because dog nails are so thick and the nail pads that came with the tool are kind of fine. So after 15 minutes of filing, there really was not much result. Pretty bummed out that I wasted $30 on the Dremel tool, but I think we'll be sticking to the dog clippers in the future."
3,"Ok for small dogs, need to upgrade sanders for med or large dogs","The sanders included are small, so you will need coarse 1/2 bands for any pet larger than a toy breed. I have a dobe/aussie mix (large nails) that has disliked getting his nails trimmed since being a puppy. I need to replace the batteries after every other use or else the speed is not fast enough to grind his thick nails. After each use, I also disconnect the battery piece from the handle to retain the charge. Once familiar with the buzzing, my dog definitely prefers a Dremel versus a nail clipper. It is also difficult to hit the quick of the nail if you use a light touch. I like the cordless feature because it's easier to handle and easy to transport. However, I would suspect a corded Dremel would produce a more constant rotation. All in all, a good product with the exception of battery life. I resolved that by using rechargeable batteries. However, this product would work best with smaller breed dogs or cats."
1,"Eats batteries so fast, it's almost ineffective.","I can't believe how fast you burn through a set of batteries (4 Duracell AAs). You use it once and it's dead, especially if you use the high speed. It's also a pain to change the sanding bands on it. I am very dissatisfied with this product's performance."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this particular dremel to groom my dog's nails because it was cordless, thinking the cord would get in the way. Unfortunately, the great idea of having no cord was overshadowed by the frustrating fact that the batteries (4 double AA) wear out after one use. I couldn't believe when I turned the Dremel on the second time and the thing wouldn't turn on! I returned it and Amazon gave me my money back. I now use the guillotine clippers on my puppy. You can use these carefully and you MUST start when the puppy is very young (preferably before they are 12 weeks old) otherwise the guillotine can be very traumatic and frustrating."
5,this looks familiar....,isnt this the same as the pumpkin carver? different attachments? oh boy!! (sarcasm)....i like dremels
1,piece of junk,My dog hates it and so do I!!! She will not let me touch her claws with it and when I do I can not see where it does anything or takes any thing off. Not reccommended!!!
1,Item Never Received,"I ordered this item, and after 30 days of the company not shipping, my order was cancelled."
1,Do not buy the Dremel 761-03 for large dogs,"Don't waste your money if you have a large dog. I bought this thinking it was a reasonably priced Dremel product that should work well because it is made by Dremel. I am in the process of returning it. We have an 80 pound dog, and this machine barely grinds his nails. Additionally it chews through batteries. I did not expect it to work as well as the 120V versions, but it should have worked pretty well. After 2 uses I purchased a real 120V Dremel grinder, which is fabulous."
4,Works well . . .,"but my dog is terrified! It took several weeks of ""peanut butter therapy"" to get my beagle to relax around this thing. We still have to hold him and feed him when we want to do his nails (a two person job).Product itself works well. Be ready to be patient if your dog fears small appliances."
3,pet nail trimmer,Good at what I need which is just smoothing out the nail after I trim it. Batteries don't seem to last long but could have something to do with me using rechargeable batteries.
2,Doesn't stand-up to the Dremel name,"I bought this tool b/c I have other Dremel tools and they have always performed very well over the years. But this tool is the worst piece of craftsmanship I've ever seen from Dremel. The battery casing is a pain to figure out and once put together the battery casing consistently came unlatched. Once I finally got the battery casing rigged on the tool I went to turn it on the ""High"" setting and it didn't work. I switched it over to ""Low"" and that worked. It was very annoying that I couldn't use the tool in the ""High"" setting. I gave it to my husband to figure out he just gave it a good WHACK and the ""High"" setting turned on finally. But then the battery rigging came loose. It was BAD all the way around. So don't waste your time with this just go get some nail clippers."
2,Big Dogs No Chance This Will Work,"We received the Pet Nail Dremel, and we were very excited to try this on our 105 pound lab since he hates the clippers. We were very disappointed with the tool for many reasons.1. There is no way it can sand down any type of large breed nails;unless its a puppy large breed.2. The friction from the dremel on the nail takes only 3 seconds before it gets to hot,and that is not long enough to sand down my own nail much less than our labs.3. The size of the sanders that come with the dremel might work on a small maybe medium dog at best.4. It is very time consuming and it would take me days to complete the filing on a medium dog, and for our large breed dog forget about it! Back to the vet we go."
4,Works great for sanding nails,Filing your pets nails is WAY better than clipping them. You don't have to worry about cutting the quik and making them bleed and cry in pain. I filed down my 90 pound retriever's nails with this and so far so good. It was fast and painless.I would recommend you file your pet's nails outside or someplace where there is proper ventilation. The sanding of the nails flies all over the place and will make it hard to breathe.File down in quick 1-2 seconds burst as to not create too much heat. Your pet will thank you.
2,It's alright...,"We bought this for the ""pet tool"" it's advertized to be, but it is difficult to use. It doesn't have a guard, so it is messy, but is also hard to control on the dog's nails. It's also a bit too loud, so it frightens them. It's still a struggle to trim the nails, but I guess still better than cutting."
3,Not as gentle as I thought,I have two small dogs. One won't let me get near her because of the noise and the other tolerates it. It is like using a dermel tool meant for woodwork.
3,Good But Not Great,The dremel is good in that it is a quality tool and is easy to use. I have two small puppies with soft nails and this dremel is barely strong enough to do their nails even when it is on high. I wonder how it would perform with the tougher nails of an adult dog. Also the batteries run low very fast I would recommend rechargeable batteries. If you have a dog that is a drama queen they will definitely take a while to get used to it but more calm dogs take to it easily. With our drama queen we got him used to it a little at a time and one of us holds him while the other files the nail.
1,Did not come with any grinding drums,"Ordered from Amazon and opened package and unit did not come with any grinding drums AT ALL- so the thing is completely useless without them. An unexpected pain to have to deal with, call manufacturer? return to Amazon?"
2,No power!,Not enough power for all nails to be done on one battery life. Wouldn't recommend. Quite enough for it not to frighten the animal but no power within unit to really do nails. A shame cause we like its portability
2,What a waste,"I bought this in hopes it would help me maintain my English Bulldog's nails. This tool is worthless, it does nothing! Maybe it's better for small dogs, but for a larger breeds I would say, save your money. I'm going to look to see if maybe another attachment will work with it and perhaps do the trick."
2,LOUD,I tried to use this product on my 2 dogs and they both freaked out because of the high pitched noise. Then I tried Peticure and it was not only quieter but easier to use because if the guides. it was impossble to trim the nails too short and hit the quick.
1,Waste of money!,"Dremel 761-03 7,000/14,000 RPM Cordless Pet Nail Grooming Rotary ToolDoes not work well, to loud!"
1,RETURN,I wish I knew where I could return this product as my dog is scared of the sound it makes and the job it does is very POOR. It takes forever to do it and I used it for 1 nail and quit and put it away and will never use it again. THANKS FOR ASKING
5,Great little tool,I got this for a puppy who was so terrified of clippers that I had to hand file her black nails. I bought it because the price was good and I didn't know if she would accept it. I did not want to waste the money in the event that my puppy would not accept that either. She was a bit hesitant at first but warmed up to it by the third paw. I have had it for a month now and have done 3 rounds with my adult golden and 5 rounds with my puppy on the same batteries. I don't know how long they will last but I am satisfied.The size is fits comfortably in my hands and the fact that it is cordless makes it easy to manipulate. It is very quiet so it does not spook the dogs. It took a little for them to get comfortable with the vibration from the spinning drum. The instructions suggest a 1/2 inch drum and sander for larger dogs and I got those. Although the included 1/4 inch have worked just fine but a bit slower.
4,Good quality tool!,"i was originally going to buy the peticure tool online but it was out of stock...then i came upon this dremel made especially for pets...it's a great tool as long as your pets allow you to use it on them...once you get used to controlling it, it's great and works really well on getting my 20lb dogs nails down to a short length...now i don't have to trim as often as i did when using a traditional nail clipper...i recommend that you go to the peticure website for proper instructions on how to trim your pets nails with a rotary tool...overall a great product."
4,"Great for maintenance, not so great for longer claws","The poor dog usually shakes with fear when he sees us pull out the dog nail clippers, so we decided to pick up the Dremel nail grooming tool. Before diving in and using the tool immediately, I recommend turning it on and letting your dog get accustomed to the sound and the vibration. The instructions don't include how to angle it against the dog's paws presumably because you'll find technique and method that's comfortable for you and your dog. The vibration and spinning also rattles the tool so make sure you have a firm grip to prevent injury to you and your dog's paws. The dog's nails should be relatively short before you start filing away, otherwise, it will take a while to file it down to the desired length. We're also going to plan to groom the nails every other week or so to keep the nails from growing too long to be unmanageable.Great buy and better deal than the $30 Peticure being hawked in those TV infomercials."
3,Just a Dremel,"It's just a dremel with an insert describing how to use it with pets. There's no guard to prevent one from dremeling too close to the quick.If you already have a dremel, use that. Just let the pet get used to the noise, praise them, give them treats for staying calm near it. And once they don't react to it, dremel their nails being careful to not get close to the quick. The same way you'd do with any other nail trimming device.If you don't have a dremel, you could get this one primarily to use on your pets, but you can still use it for any other dremelly purposes...so that's handy."
4,Dremel pet groomer,"Great product! I never tought I'd find anything that my Rottweiler would let touch his paws, but this Dremel is great. I also tried the PediPaws, did not like it at all. Rommel's nails were so long I was able to file more than just a few seconds per nail, but I went with what I saw was comfortable for my dog, so that should be your guide. Thank you Dremel!!"
3,Battery Hog,If this dremel had a cord it would have been perfect. We only used it twice before the batteries went dead. Now we'll be buying a standard corded dremel with varying speeds.
4,great product - lousy instructions,"took forever to figure out how to put it together, but it works well with a minimum amount of fear from my dog."
1,waste of money,"My Mom bought one of these. It does a terrible job. heats up, scares the dogs, freaks the cat out.I don't know about you, but my mom's dog doesn't want to sit there for 10 to 15 minutes with his nails heating up while you try to file them down with this thing.The cat just hisses and hides if he sees it.A total waste of money."
2,Great idea that needs to be refined.,I think the product is a great idea. But having to switch feet each nail because of the heat it builds is just to annoying. Plus my babies don't have that kind off patiences.
3,"Works OK, but...","Pros: once it's running, it does the job well. I would recommend it. And the dogs don't mind too much, especially the larger one. She will sit there & let me do it. The little one squirms a bit. The batteries last awhile too.Cons: Takes 4 AA batteries. And when I turn it on, it doesn't usually start. I have to start spinning the sander to get it going."
2,Don't buy this product if you have a large dog.,"I have a 110 lb Doberman and this product was not even close to being powerful enough for his nails.Dremel 761-03 7,000/14,000 RPM Cordless Pet Nail Grooming Rotary Tool. I was very disappointed since I chose it over purchasing the ""pedicure"" and other such products because of Dremel's reputation. I gave it away to someone with smaller dogs and hope they get some use out of it"
4,Sooooo much better than the clippers,"This is heads and tails better than any other way of cutting a dog's nails. We just got a new puppy and she would not let us anywhere near her nails the other way. With this, we just feed her treats and then file her nails while she's focused on us. She barely notices.I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the batteries really do wear down quickly. There is a general Dremel model that's rechargable and that might be a good option. For us, we just got a set of quickly recharging batteries and that works fine."
5,Better than regular nail clippers!,"I have 3 dogs and each one runs at the sight of the nail clippers. Getting them used to the Dremel was great, but somewhat time consuming. One of my dogs got used to the Dremel right away(didn't need treats for her), and the other two took about 2-3 months. It took a lot of treats and daily paw handling to calm those two down. But once I got their nails dremeled it was all worth it. Their nails come out nice and smooth and a decent length. No more worrying about cutting into the quick. I would highly recommend getting 15min rechargable batteries though."
4,Good deal for the price,Surprized at how well this less expensive grooming tool works. Worth every penny!
1,battery operated dremel tool ...,"This dremel tool is supposed to be able to grind down dog toenails. It didn't have enough power. I sent it back and bought an electric one. I own 3 border collies, I imagine if I had smaller dogs, it would be fine."
4,easy to use if your dogs let you!,very straight forward tool I was happy with the results. The fast function seems to get the job done better.
2,Not for me,"I thought this product would make nail maintenance a breeze for my dogs, but Nope not the case. My dog was patient with me, but the product didn't shorten her nail. I can't even say it smoothed it. I take my dogs to the vet for nail trimming still. I bought two, one for me and one for my son's girlfriend. It didn't work for her either, so the product may work for some, but it's not for me."
5,Great product!,"I have a corded dremel, but the speed is waaaaay too fast for trimming my maltese nails. This does the trick beautifully! It's also much easier to lie the dog in my lap on the sofa, on the floor - where ever we happen to be when we get in the ""mood"" for nail trimming."
1,NO GOOD! POWERLESS AND KILLS BATTERIES LIKE CRAZY,"I had this item for now 3 months, i have 2 standard Poodles, let me tell you this:With new batteries install you can stop the spinning on the dogs nails.Batteries won't last. I can do the 2 dogs and then i need to replace the batts. I'm going now for the rechargeable version that also has more power.I will say, forget it... hope this helps folks."
1,Does not work well at all,"The Dremel dos a poor job at grinding down nails. It is hard to control and does not do much grinding. I previously had a Peticure and it worked very well until a bearing in the motor failed. I tried the cheaper Dremel but it barely takes off any nail at all. The Peticure's nail protection cover seemed to be a little bit of a hassle, but it actually worked very well - it helped position the sanding drum and let me apply more pressure to ramove more nail faster. I think I will order a corded Peticure and be done with it."
3,The sound is not the problem.,"OK so I'm not sure yet about this product. My dog is not afraid of the sound, which is great and surprising at the same time because she's afraid of a lot. However, I can't get the dremel close enough to her nails to even trim them. She's 60 pounds, so I can't do it alone. Still working on this one."
2,Disapointment,"This product is not powerful enough to get the job done in less than 5 sittings. I had to replace the batteries a couple of times, and it is still not really powerful enough. Any pressure at all exerted against the nail will stop the rotation. I intend to return it, hoping that there is a more poserful tool."
3,Draining Dremel,"If I had the choice again I would have gotten a regular Dremel with a rechargeable battery. We have used this product a few times and each time we used it we had to replace the batteries. It is the same exact tool as the regualr Dremel you get in stores and you can get more for your money there.Still, it works great on pets nails."
2,Dremel Pet Nail Trimmer,"Don't waste your time.It's weak, has low RPMs and BURNS through batteries.FOUR at a time no less.WELL worth the money to get a real Dremel tool, it's mucheasier on the pets nails and gets the job done so muchfaster that they don't fidget as much. There's far lessvibration with the extra RPMs as well."
1,Dremel,We found this item to be very under powered. It took batteries and burned them out in one use. Sent it back and bought just a regular dremel.....corded and works great.
4,Absolutely Great!!,"I highly recommend this tool!! I have an Akita and my dog is a big baby when it comes to cutting her nails. I bought this tool on the advice of a friend, who has 6 dogs. This Dremel tool is much quieter than a similar product that I tried. It does not scare her! I am very pleased with it!! It's really easy to use!"
1,Not so good,"Not what I was expecting, my dogs are scared to death of it because it vibrates to much. I held it on the toenail and didn't see any effect. It tells you not to hold it for more than 3 seconds because the toenail will get hot. Scary Item!!!"
1,No thanks,High speed didn't work. Not worth the money. Doesn't go fast enough to cut any thickness of nails.
2,can't review the product if it doesn't come with the proper parts,I've yet to actually try this product on my dog because the tool did not come with the right-sized parts for use. The instructions are also not very helpful. They don't even show what the tool looks like when the sanding drum is put on. I hope the dremel amazes me once I actually get it to work because I'm not impressed so far.
1,My dog hates it,"I tried using it on my 3 month old puppy (at the time)he was so scared of it touching him that there's no way in hell he will ever let me trim his nails with it.Now it's absolutely useless.Get a dog clipper, this is a total waste of money."
3,Needs improvement,"My 2 small dogs received the cordless dremel as a Christmas gift. I loved it, they tolerated it. We did have to buy batteries by the box, perhaps rechargable would help. My only complaint is that the battery cover never stayed on properly causing power loss."
5,Great grooming product,I have a corgi with very difficult nails to cut. This has saved us a tremendous amount of time and effort to keeping the dogs nails trimmed.
4,"Works great, if dogs cooperate.","This is really a nice tool. We have two dogs, one will tolerate it and one goes berserk. It really does a good job of filing down their nails, and you don't have to worry so much about cutting off too much. It doesn't eat batteries, either, which is nice. It is not particularly loud, so I don't think that is what bothers the one dog. For the dog that will let us use it on her, it is great."
3,Disappointing battery life,"The tool makes for an easy cleanup of your dogs nails and is much easier on the dog itself for a fidgety nervous dog. However I am very disappointed in the battery life of the device as it basically went through 4 Double A batteries in a single session. The device was running slow by the end of the nail cleanup, and although there was power left, the RPM's were quite reduced. An AC power cord would be a nice option."
1,Pet Rotary Tool- Not good for hard nails,"The Dremel Pet Rotary Tool is not a good purchase for pets with dark, hard nails. I have a small dog so this size seemed ideal however, the tool does not have enough power to get through the nail and stops on contact with the nail. I do not recommend it. Perhaps it will work for pets with softer nails like cats or small dogs with light nails."
1,You might be able to use it as a rotary tool,It just isn't feasible at all. Don't believe any of the commercials you see. Those dogs are actors after all. Poor things.
2,a gaget that does not work and noise scares the dog,The dogs hair got caught on the pads of the trimmer. It is hard to hold dog and trim at the same time. I dot not recommend this product.
2,So So,I have a small dog and he wiggles so this is hard to work with for me. It does do the job but becareful. My dogs fur not tangled in it and ripped it off. I felt so bad. Most of the time I have the vet do this job or take him to the salon.
5,A seamless journey through classic 'New York' and 'Chicago house' !,"Though the mix is full of screaming highs on the EQ for this live studio mix, if you dial back the highs to a comfortable setting,This mix CD is a true timeless experience of some of the best turntable mixing and track selection of new york and chicago house and overseas tunes as well while DJ Duke here showcases a de-tuned horn sample with reverb and flangethat flows in and out throughout the entire mix :-) Really awesome mix for the new york and chicago hardcore house fansfrom all parts of the globe !5 out of 5"
1,Do not buy this charger,"DOA. Same story as the other reviewers, the charger does not work, only the little red LED is functional. This is a JUNK charger, don't waste your time and money."
1,Junk,"Does not work... I tried my Nokia 6101 with this charger... Just a message that ""NOT CHARGING""...Will have to return this piece of junk"
1,Nice little red LED,"Bought two at Christmas; by Feb 1st, the only thing that worked was the little red LED. The first time I tried to use the first one, I got a NOT CHARGING message on my phone. When I tried the second charger, I didn't even get that; but the red LED still works well on both. I guess you still get cheap junk when you only pay a few dollars."
4,Good if dry coverage of dot.com bust,"There have been a lot of books about the crash of the high tech market. This is one of the best. The coverage is thorough if at times tedious. Cassidy makes an excellent case that the lack of a business model and the prevalent ""greater fool"" theory led to the demise of the Internet bubble. Too many pitched the idea that if their site captured just one percent of a [Hundred] billion-dollar market, than the firm would be a success. Only even one percent was a pipe dream, and perhaps a dozen firms had the same idea. And the ""greater fool"" theory suggests that even if the originators are wrong, somebody else will be foolish enough to buy them out.Cassidy concludes his good work with a lengthy table of dot.com failures, a sobering story in itself. Perhaps it is so sobering that the life and exhuberance of the subject drained away. I found the last third of the book to be more of a continuous litany of mistakes and I lost much of my interest."
2,not good enough,"The author failed to tell the whole story and should write more info.on the rise and fall of the CMGI Inc. How and why CMGI CEO David Wetherell blocked the merger between Lycos and USA network? Since CMGI was such an important company throughout the boom and the collapse of the internet stock sector. Basically the book is being written like a newspaper, only storytelling and the author provided no real explaination of the collapse of the nasdaq stock market."
1,A few errors,"There are a number of errors in this book. For example, the author states that the Altair computer was named after a chracter in the movie Star Wars. Funny, Star Wars was released after the Altair. Hahah The Altair computer was named from a star named Altair. A glaring error and sloppy work that needed to be corrected before press time. Other errors follow."
1,Dot.con is the worst book I've ever read,This book is so full of bad information it just blows me away. What is presented as fact in the book is simply not true. I don't know where the author came up with the information he did. It is pure vapor.This book was not just poorly written but it is full of gramatical and spelling errors. Hello spell check!A waste of money.
5,Greed Can Kill!,"During the 1995-2000 period, investing was fun. Everyone was making money.Like the Dutch tulip frenzy and the pre-1929 Era in the United States, greed overcame common sense. History repeated itself again during the internet craze. The detailed chronicle of the event in the text brought back too many bad memories, especially my investment losses."
3,Good summary,"All the stories were told many times in other books. There is nothing new about this book. However, it serves as a good summary for those CEOs or senior managers who wish to have a quick review of what happened in the last two years, but never paid attention to this dot.com industry, now dot.con....."
1,Hindsight rehash,"This book is a hindsight rehash of dotcom events that will already be very familiar to anyone who has picked up the business section of a newspaper or any business magazine in the last couple of years. Meanwhile, as other reviewers have noted, the book is rife with errors. The author also fails to give proper credit to the bestselling book that exposed the dotcon while it was happening, ""The Internet Bubble"", released in the fall of 1999."
5,Very original!,"This is one of the best Garfield books I have seen. It is set up like an encyclopedia, with subjects in alphabetical order, all with Garfield's comments and thoughts. Covers everything from tatoos to dinosaurs to dessert. Very funny and enjoyable!"
4,pleased,This is a great product if want some basic information or a simple review. Well writen and it re views matterial that is needed
5,"aprendi,a valorar la vida de verdad","este libro lo lei cuando estaba en sptimo grado. en ese entonces era una ninha que nunca agradecio con todas la fuerzas del corazon por todo lo que tenia. desde ese dia en que lei el capitulo, donde Zeze llegaba tarde a la reparticion de juguetes, aprendi lo dificil y dolorosa que es la vida de los mas pobres, y lo importante que es llegar a tener tan solo un juguete.hasta hoy el libro lo lei 4 veces, y les aseguro que si lo leyera la quinta vez, seguiria llorando.el libro me lo recomendo mi madre, y yo se los recomendare a mis hijos, para que asi aprendan lo importante que es agradecer por lo que uno tiene."
4,Ageless Fun,This toy is addicting even for a woman over 40. Good thing to have to pass the time. I would not go to a doctor appointment or get on public transportation without it. I have let people play this from 7 to 57 and they have all enjoyed it. My only complaint is that the screen gets dirty very quickly and adults with larger hands find it a little difficult and a stylus might have been helpful. For younger users it is inevitable that the cover will get broken as they tend to take it of and not put it on the back. Mine already has several scratches. If you enjoy board games or hand held games this is for you.
3,Yahtzee,"For those who require a half to an hour of diversion, this game is the ticket. The game tends to fill the spot for the non serious gambler. Probably best taken in short doses."
5,Great Game,Yahtzee Wild is a great game. It's so much fun to play. The large touch screen is very easy to see. It's great to have a choice of 2 games - Wild or the original Yahtzee game. Highly recommend.
2,wrong book was sent,to get it change they wanted me to pay to send it back an couldnt tell me if i would get it faster after waiting so long for it . i was dissapointed
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this DVD for my daughter's first year but she just wouldn't watch it for more than a couple of minutes. I put it away and hoped she would enjoy it later on. She is almost two and can't stand it for more than five minutes. So I guess when she is a teenager she might like it! ;-) She loves other videos: Baby Einstein series, Sesame Street and Barney. So, save your money and look elsewhere for educational videos."
1,Gumball machine jewelry,"This actually looks real nice on the website. I ordered it for my wife last Christmas. When I received it, I was dissapointed at its quality. It wasn't worth the shipping charge (free). I decided to give it to my girlfriend instead."
3,Happy to have the book,I was happy to rec'd the book only to the book was so weak and delicate. Thought the book was more stronger and not brittal hoping to find another book. But thank you
5,A MUST FOR EVERY FREESTYLE FAN..........,"SOLID, SOLID, SOLID. One of, if not the, BEST compilations of freestyle classics. LQQK whos here.....STEVIE B's ""Spring Love"" is awesome. LISA LISA's ""Wonder if I Take You Home"" is amazing. NOEL's ""Silent Morning"" is da BOMB. And Giggles' ""Love Letter"" is a song you will never forget. They should have called this cd ""SOLID GOLD FREESTYLE"". Every track on it is a winner. Looking for classic freestyle? Then B-U-Y I-T !"
3,Interesting Polypoid Uvula Displacement: A Clinical History,"This is a brief article taken from ""Ear, Nose and Throat Journal"" (82:3, p. 347, May 1, 2003) concerning a rather unusual case of a polyp displacing the uvula and soft palate of a 35 year old male patient. The method of removal is detailed (endoscopic excision, and cleanup with a backbiter and microdebrider): the patient made a complete recovery and experienced complete relief of the nasal obstruction that had been occluding his left nostril.The article is well written and informative for specialists in the field, but given the brevity of the article (less than one page; 639 words) I believe the price is excessive. Nonetheless, this presents an interesting clinical history of polypoid uvula displacement."
2,Great idea. Very fun when it works.,"My child received this for Christmas. Use a small screwdriver to unscrew battery compartment. Put in batteries and your off. This toy is great group fun. Tossing it around based on the color hand pass you have.Problem is the toy starts shutting off when it is caught. It appears to be random. You are tossing it back and forth and when a person catches it, it turns off. So then you have to go thru the whole sign on process again. We spend more time setting the game up than playing it. I would stay away from this toy until the quality control improves.Update: I called Hasbro after Christmas. I told them it was a gift (no receipt) and that I couldnt take it back to a store. Hasbro customer service is very good. They said they would send a replacement. The replacement works great."
2,"Fun game, when it works","My daughter wanted cosmic catch so much, so we gave it to her yesterday for birthday. It was fun for about 20 minutes, then it stopped working and hasn't worked since. I just took it back to walmart this morning and got our money back. I'm going to let her decide whether to risk buying another one or buy something else...."
2,Battery problem...,"This toy is a great idea, although it needs some work. It is very difficult to get the battery compartment to open , as others have stated. The kids loved it at first, but it became very frustrating even for adults. Even when the ball was passed to the correct color band it would not recognize it and just make the error sound. We laid all of the bands on the counter and tried to see how long the ball would go and it sometimes would just make the error sound within a few attempts. The kids lost interest pretty fast."
4,Fun game!,My mom likes this game possibly more than the kids do. She just holds the ball and uses the directions by tapping the hand bands. I like it.
5,makes them giggle,"my kids love to play this game, we even take it with us on trips so their friends can play."
5,Don't miss out on one of these!,We have had one for a year now and find new and different ways to play still! I just purchased a second for a friend after telling her how much fun the ball is.
5,Fun all around game,Our 5 year old got very inventive with this game. She put four different color bands on her hands and feet and played the first game. She had to put up a different body part for each color the game called. Then three of us took the same idea but put different colors on each hand. We put the ball between us and tapped the ball with whatever color it called. We also love playing the traditional methods. We did not have a problem with the screws.
2,SO FRUSTRATING!!,"This could have been a fun game. We've been trying to play with it but sometimes it will recognize the color band and then for no reason it won't. Very frustrating for a 5 year old! (and a 36 year old mom!) We've tried holding the ball differently, smashing it together with our hands, rubbing the color band on it, squeezing the ball...sometimes it works, sometimes not. I think they need to work out a few bugs before this becomes the hot new game."
2,Don't waste your money,"Just purchased this for my 7 year old. It worked for about five minutes and never worked again. Like the other reviewers said - the concept is great, but too bad it is a piece of junk and doesn't work. Don't waste your money."
3,Cosmic Catch unreliable,"The Cosmic Catch is an ideal toy for teaching directions and honing listening skills, if you get one that works reliably. The one that I have used so far doesn't always turn on and turns off in the middle of play. Too bad cause I really liked it when it was demonstrated. I ordered 3. I hope I don't have the same experience with the other two."
4,Cosmic Ball,"We all enjoyed playing this and my 12 year old granddaughter thought it was really fun. We also played with our 4 year old grandson, and it was actually making him listen and react quickly, although a little difficult for him at times, but he had a blast. It's great watching all the kids laugh. We had no issues of the ball not working or problems with getting the batteries in or out."
2,Battery problem,It is a great toy...when it works. My problem whith this toy is that it hardly ever works. I tryed to turn it on today about 30 times three of those times it turned on but when it told me to sighn in it turned of.I tryed it again and it didn't work.
4,Fun for all ages,Had no prob putting the batteries in - had a ton of fun with the toy. All ages over 5 - boys and girls have enjoyed this fun toy. Good workout. I would tell the reviewer who said the batteries didnt stay put to exchange it for another. We had NO problems at all.
2,Flimsy piece of techno-junk,"The kids had fun with it when it worked.... which wasn't often.It took us an hour to figure out how to open the battery compartment. (The screws are buried under an inch of foam.) Then, when it was being used, the ball would intermittently stop working because the batteries lost contact. (The pieces of metal they are supposed to touch are small and flimsy, and the ball gets jolted during regular play.)Nice idea, but we can't recommend it!"
2,have a screwdriver handy...,"The reviewer that said that the batteries keep losing contact is right. We were getting maybe an hour or two of play on each changeout of 4-AAA's. Then I read that review and tried just removing and replacing the same batteries when it stopped working. Sure enough it started working again. Quite a pain to keep having to do this and I have a feeling the small screws are going to stip very soon and we'll have to chuck it in the trash. My son got this for a birthday present, and he really does love it, but its a piece of junk just like the other reviewer said."
1,Could not get it to shut up!,"I purchased this for twin brothers who are friends of my son. I thought they could play with it together. However, after reading the instructions thoroughly over and over, the ball never stopped prompting us ""do you want to play again?"" I had to pull the batteries lose to get it to be quiet. I exchanged it thinking it was a fluke and didn't test the replacement. The boys mom told me later that the second one never shut up either. I'm not entirely a dope when it comes to electronics, so either the instructions need to be a whole lot clearer or the quality control is poor."
2,Battery compartment malfunction!,"Alright, I see other reviews below that have stated that if you use the correct screwdriver, duh, it will open. Well guess what, it won't on mine. The screws just turn and turn and never come completely loose. Three different people worked on this thing Christmas day! They need to redesign the battery compartment. It looks like a fun toy, but until we return ours and get one that we can put batteries in, we will never know."
2,Not My Cup of Tea.....,I am a big fan of all MA styles and movies. I didn't like this one at all. I am familiar with US Shorinji Kempo and was thinking I would see some good stuff here. Other than a few wrist locks there was little to enjoy. Acting was horrible and execution was pretty poor.... Just my two cents.
3,The Killing Machine-Shorinji Kenpo,"I had seen this movie many years ago,and thought that it did a fairly good job of portraying the art ofShorinji Kenpo.It was truly one of Sonny Chiba's best. For the action, it is worth watching."
2,What's going on here?,"When she faces, or is faced by, the natural world or adventure or happy occasions, her poetry is often first rate. Otherwise, this is mostly an adolescent whine. Rather than having been abused, she abuses others, particularly her parents. The incest in all likelihood did not happen, but is inserted for dramatic effect or is imagined, the result of a confabulation between the author and so-called counsellors who were convinced that every hangnail, stomach upset, or emotional upheaval is unequivocal evidence that you were sexually abused as a child."
2,Beware! Not for standard modem.,"I didn't realize when I ordered it, but it is not your standard Ethernet cable. Didn't work for any of my modem or standard computer connections. I need to be smarter when shopping. Not the company fault, but would like a better explanation for us amateurs."
2,Loose Ends,"This cable seemed heavy duty and I purchased it to replace the flat phone cable I was using for my DSL, but after a few days the cord sheath started separating from the connector, so the wires were exposed. I was vacuuming and noticed it hanging funny off of the wall. All in all a disappointment."
4,Belkin DSL Modem Cable,This cable is definately far superior to the flimsy DSL cable provided by AT&T and surpassed my expectations with regard to quality and durability. And the extra length of the Belkin cable allows me to place the modem in a much better location than before. But I can't say I've experienced any improvements in connection speeds over the flimsy cable provided by AT&T - nowhere near the increased connection speed referenced in the marketing/product description. Thus only 4 stars instead of 5 stars for me.
3,Will it make a difference?,"Well, I have not seen such a difference when I replaced the cable. Actually the plugs maybe defected since when I have installed the plug into my modem I could not remove it out. I tried many times but could not. I you try more force you can break your modem RJ-11 Port. Just in case consider this as a permanent cable since you better not remove it."
4,Good product,"I was using a flat RJ11M/M phone cable for my DSL. Longer cables resulted in loss of connectivity. I needed to get my router off the floor, and purchased the Belkin High-Speed Internet modem cable. The cable solved my problems of poor connectivity. The product advertises higher data transfer rates, but I do not see any improvement in performance; just an improvement in reliability of my connection. The performance issue could be related to a host of other factors such as wall wiring, PC processor speed, internet data transfer speeds etc. I liked the cable and would recommend to anyone who needs to install the DSL router at a distance of 15 ft from the wall point."
1,"Bad Quality, Nothing like the picture","Hi i have received de flamenco dancer costume.. and i know that is cheap but the quality es very very poor, first of all the color is like glow pink and it came whith many errors on the manufacturing the seams are on the bad places really really an awful costume.. to receive a defective costume i will prefer to make one myself .. Please do NOT buy it..."
2,Any static electricity will reset the watch!,"I like the watch except for the fact that it's easily reset by static electricity. Weird, I know. That's especially annoying when you have a bunch of times stored in the watch's data feature (its most appealing feature).If you're putting on or taking off a shirt, the static electricity will shock the watch and you will hear the watch beep. From there it shows a bunch of random symbols and numbers before it resets a few seconds later, losing the time and anything you stored.I've had this happen about 5 times now, really frustrating."
1,i dont realy know why i bought this.,"this book realy dosnt tell you anything. it's just a random collection of myths and stories about different poisonus herbs. i love how the author emphisizes that these herbs can be used medicinally but in now way tells you how. if your looking for a book that tells you how to use nightshade or hemlock appropriately, keep looking."
2,Not What I Was Looking For,While I found many of the recollections to be intersting and informative I couldn't escape the fact that the author of this book is pro- interventions and pro- status quo. The author exemplifies the best and the worst about hospital care in the United States although she practised in Canada and Scotland.
2,Nothing to say,"When reviewing a novel, one either likes it or not. I am displeased to say that I neither liked it or not. I like the story line; however, it was not well developed. There was no oomph! No explanations, expansions or anything such thing. I was sadly disappointed because the first novel in the series was great and I can see the potential of this series but I wonder if the author and her publisher do.Write on, read onN.M. Phillips"
5,good printer stand,"This printer stand is a very good size for a large printer with two generously-sized shelves. It is very sturdy with well designed hardware. It easily and quickly went together. The only thing I would suggest would be to number the parts. I was able to figure out which were sides, back etc. from the pictures in the assembly instructions, but having the parts labeled with a removable sticker would have helped."
5,Printer Stand,The stand is awesome and well built. The price was great but shipping was very high. Looks great and is sturdy and an asset to my furniture and fits perfect with desk and space . Plenty of room for storage as well !
1,Makita 763198-1 keyless chuck,"Locked-up after only one use with my impact driver in drill mode. My 3/8"" brand new titanium bit is still stuck in the chuck. Yes I know how to use a keyless chuck and despite 30 minutes of trying to get it out it's locked-up tighter than welded steel. No problem with slippage that's for sure. Now I have a $29.00 chuck dedicated to one drill bit. I thought buying the Makita brand chuck would pay off, wrong on my part. Yes, I put my drill on impact mode in reverse to try to get it to release to no avail.No, I cannot and will not recommend this chuck for any impact driver!!"
4,Allows for use of any bits with Makita drills and drivers,I use this attached to my Makita impact drill and driver combo set which my wife purchased for my birthday. Unfortunately the driver required a hex-style drill bit or driver bit. I purchased this product to allow me to use any bit with my drills.Pros:- Solid construction- Works great with Makita driversCons:- Heft of keyless chuck unbalances some- Hand-tightened chuck is not as secure as tool chucks used on different drills
2,Maybe I'm just a noob?,It seems heavier and bulkier than it needs to be and you have to spin it on a power drill to tighten a bit properly. Is this how all keyless chucks work? Just wasted my money. I was hoping to use it to fit standard bits onto a spiral ratcheting screwdriver when power isn't an option. Makita could have gave this chuck a lot more uses if they'd thought about it a little bit harder. I'm going to try the Milwaukee one with the keyed chuck. I guess I'll hold on to it in case I get one of those impact driver rebates from Milwaukee.
1,does not work right,Bought this for my husband to make it easier for him so he could use different bits and accessories for his drill. It does not work like advertised.
1,Does not work at all.,I picked it up at local Home Depot for light job.The first one froze and second one did the same thing.I took it back to Home Depot who could not fix it.Total waste of money and frustration.
1,Broke after less than 20 uses,This chuck was great until it locked my bit in and then would not release it. I struggled with it for about an hour before I was able to get my high dollar Dewalt titanium bit out. It seams that the chuck is stripped inside it so that when you try to loosen or tighten the chuck now the jaws remain motionless. I was shocked to have this happen since Makita is a favorite of mine in most of their tools and this chuck seems sturdy. I'll give the Dewalt chuck a shot.
2,Less than I expected,"Given the high caliber reputation of Makita, I was surprised at the poor performance of this product. The racheting feature that apparently is designed to prevent overtightening just has the effect of not tightening the grip at all. Drill bits of all sizes slip right out, often staying behind in the material. This makes removal awkward at best. The overall construction and machining seem good, but a flaw in the design. I'm returning mine."
3,Idea is better than the reality,"I bought mine thinking great I can bring my impact driver and leave my drill at home. I was under the car drilling out some bolts when I realized this idea was not going to happen. The chuck which is suppose to be keyless is near impossible to get tight enough to hold a bit. It has a hole for a key, it lacks the teeth to be able use one. As the hole progressed it became impossible to continue with this attachment. The attachment itself does not sit well in the driver so there is also noticeable wobble. Not to mention when it binds the impact drive comes on...nope this is not going to ever do what I wish it would."
4,Skitz mix 4,"I purchased nick skitz 4 about 6 weeks ago, and have loved every minute of it. If you have ever heard of Ruby2000 vol2, then this is very similar and just as good. Nick's talents are put to the extreme and i look forward to his newer albums."
5,Heard it on NPR....,"He's an American studying to be an episcopalian priest...she's an agnostic from Argentina...together they make beautiful music 8,000 miles apart."
3,surprise.. new vocalist,"I was disappointed to find that Caitlin Brice's vocals were more-or-less entirely absent from this disc.. she does a harmony on one track. If you're a fan of Through Small Windows this might take you by surprise. I'm not thrilled. Her adorably, fragile voice made the Alsace Lorraine sound for me. Love Spirals Downward did the same thing a while back but changed the band name to clue the fans into the lineup change. There is still a lot of talent on this album, but it's a different band with a different sound and probably should have had a different name. Not at all what I expected or hoped for."
5,The true story behind a man's hangover,"David Branin's ""Night Before the Wedding"" delivers...almost too much! If you've ever wanted to peek into a man's mind to see what really goes on during the infamous ""Bachelor Party"", then this a must-see film for you. Gregor Collins brings his usual A-Game - so much that I caught myself cringing, thinking that I was actually going to be in trouble with the little woman after watching this. Night Before the Wedding has a-lot-a bit of everything from Drama to Comedy. It tugs at every human emotion. Definitely recommended."
4,A bachelor party dramedy,"Enjoyed this film! The acting was superb, and the rawness of men at bachelor parties was well-developed with lots of surprises. It also explored the challenges to friendships among men when they enter into marriage."
3,Not your typical night...,"An intriguing premise with colorful characters, NIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING delivers! John Keating as Will is particularly great, as the groom-to-be with a particularly difficult decision to make."
5,Better Than Expected Funny But Serious Dramady of Wedding Jitters.,"Night before the wedding hits all the spots of comedy, drama, suspense, action, and a little extra ""something."" Good for an Independent and a must buy!"
3,great performances,"The actors bring life to this new take on an old ritual. Despite some convoluted plot points, the performances are never anything but genuine and passionate.The two actors who had the most difficult work in the cast - those who played the ""good guys,"" or morally upstanding men - were particularly compelling. Kevin Deen as the virgin with principles, made moral indignation sexy. And John Keating, as the groom-to-be, gave us a wonderfully complex portrayal of a man who is deeply in love, knows who he is, and believes in walking his talk. His fall at the end of the movie is handled deftly, and the emotional ruin in which he finds himself leaves us deeply concerned for his safety of body and mind. A complex and heartfelt performance."
5,Excellent acting by John Keating! Great directing..,"This director/writer really knows how to tell a story in a way that captivates...no big budget.No fancy SFX. No big name celebrities...just raw talent. I was especially impressed with John Keating as well as the actor who played ""Bronco""...I look forward to watching these careers...."
5,"Not ""The Hangover,"" but something special","Don't watch NBTW expecting to see ""The Hangover."" While it does have some requisite bachelor party moments--the drinking, the drugs, the strippers, the tying the bride's cousin up in the garage--it offers so much more for the discerning viewer, who is after a little truth. A very well played moral drama that speaks to something all of us guys feel, but rarely let on about. This film is a perfect example of what an independent filmmaker focuses on when making a movie vs. what a studio focuses on. If you like that honest, truthful perspective, than this film is for you!"
4,One of his more accessible efforts,"Thomas Ellard *is* Severed Heads, and Gigapus is one of his more ""popular"" oriented records. Some of the tunes drift into a quasi-hypo-trance-dance thing, and the last few tracks are pure ambient. As ever, Tom's humour shines through- in Heart of the Party he laments ""Who will tell my drunken friend that she will die and go to hell?""Perfect."
1,DO NOT BUY,"The worst snow-blower I have ever owned. It makes you really wonder if they have any engineers on staff. The drive mechanism is almost at the ""toy"" level of quality. Is uses a v belt with a very cheap idler wheel and spring mechanism to engage the impeller. Not only will it not handle the heavy snow the snowplow pushes into the edge of your drive way, but if you even try to move it it burns up the belt and you are SOL. Thing is that MTD has used this design on a lot of units that it sells under different brand names. If it looks like this unit then it is probably made by MTD, make sure you ask. On the plus side, it starts real easy so you at least act like it works..."
4,Plowed great cut right threw our recent heavy snow fall,I just go this machine the other day and I am happy with it the fact that I don't have to mix the oil with the cad is great! 5.5 hsp my only problem with it was that on small amounts of wet snow it keept clogging because it needs more of it to throw it so I found myself cleaning it more than usual but when I had to tackle the thick slushy stuff it worked fantastic I even did 10 other homes with it that day it really can move the stuff! I like it's size also I was going to purchase a larger blower but opted for this one to save on storage space. I would recommend it for early snow removal and not stuff that has iced over you would need a bigger blower with cutting blades on it to tackle that.
4,"Nice shoes, long delivery","These are really nice shoes that would work wonderfully for someone who can wear them. I do believe that the size of them is not the true size for they were too snug for the intended recipient. They may actually be a 2E or 3E but definitely not a 4E.I went to a lot of trouble to get these shoes, with them being lost in the mail and having to get another pair sent out, only to sell them to a coworker. With the problem of the mail service, I wasn't sure if they would actually get returned or if I would get any money back once they were returned.There are a lot of nice things that can be bought online with no problems at all. For me, I'll keep buying shoes at the local stores where they can be tried on."
3,Not what I was expecting,"When I bought this item I thought, judging by the picture, that it would be 3D not a flat wall hanging. So when I got a flat box in the mail I was really disappointed. The product itself is in great shape, the detail and the quality are wonderful so if you are looking for a flat wall hanging for a party or door frame it's great. Just know that it's not a 3D model."
5,A great perpective,"Yes, this book presents an Anglo perspective of Napoleon and his time in Europe. Still, the work of the Durans is fantastic as it captures historical elements from sources as diverse as visual arts, philosophy, literature as well as the customs of the time. The work is also rich in research and references, presenting numerous scripts from Napoleon himself and his subordinates.After reading this book, I was encouraged to buy the whole collection the Durans produced and I am very happy to have done so."
5,The BEST General Introduction to Nazi Germany,"I had the extreme pleasure of taking Dr. Stackelberg's course at Gonzaga University in which he uses this book. What is in the course is in this book. Any person at all interested in studying Nazi Germany should start with this book. It clearly, concisely, and logically lays out the entire history of Hitler's Third Reich. Hitler's Germany was a joy to read, and I learned a great deal from it."
3,A really fun car album,"The ferocity, the self-deprecating lyrics (penned by Elvis Costello, where nearly every word is about the music industry's manipulations of fresh ""puppet girls"" such as James), and the mighty Attractions holding it all together ... this album wants to be played loud out of a convertible on a summer's day. I think the other reviewer must be dead and channeled his review from the beyond. Much of the later Elvis material would be better served by other artists. This is a delightful prequel to Brutal Youth, one of Elvis' best."
2,Great essays - Yes A book -No!!!,"Never judge a book by its cover rings true here. As I raced to read Junger's latest work, I was quite taken with what I thought would be a well documented tale about firefighting. I got that for about 20 pages. Then the rehashed materials started. I would have been much better just getting copies of the previously published work. And the piece on Cyprus was half written by someone else!Caveat emptor. But someone should not be promoting this as his latest work. Too bad - the original pieces on firefighting and especially on Moussaud were compelling. They are just not tied to anything. Other gifted writers who publish works like this are more forthright in telling potential readers what they are."
2,Naive,"Having read Perfect Storm, I at least thought this book would be entertaining. Unfortunately, it is neither ""pleasure reading"" nor academic/objective. The author takes us on his journeys, financed no doubt from the money he made from Perfect Storm. His analysis is superficial, and one wonders if Junger ever has a solution to any of the world's problems. In this book, all he does is recount and reherse what we already now and have read elsewhere. I agree with other reviewers that you won't find writing like this in the press. It could however be a collection of essays written for National Review or Commentary. Interesting but not altogether satisfying. Spend your money on more serious books."
2,Too much for my stomach...,"What a dissapointment!! I'm not judging FIRE comparing it to THE PERFECT STORM. I think it's not always that a writer can repeat the success of his previous winning book.The trouble is that I never have imagined tha Junger would gor for some easy money, misleading his fans, releasing a book with OLD magazine articles, without EVEN REVISING THEM! THat was what shocked me the most!!"
1,Trash!,"I thought I purchased a book about fighting forest fires, you can fool me hopefully only once, see you later Junger you'll never see another penny of my money."
1,Pedestrian,"After reading the reviews of this book in the trade press, I was expecting something more than ""Bill Bryson's Modern Disaster Stories"". But that's what this book reminds me of: pulp fiction, or should I say non-fiction. The stories are interesting but self-serving. We're all supposed to be impressed by the author's wonderous experiences. But his coverage is superficial and nothing is said that is new, informative or particularly insightful. It's interesting but not worth the money. Wait for the paperback or, better yet, borrow the book from the library. One can only wonder what wonderful things Junger's publicists offered the reviewers."
1,Not Worth the Time,"I was surprised to see how long it took for Junger and his publishers to capitalize on his Perfect Storm fame. Now I see why. The fact is, he has nothing to publish. In Fire, Junger manages to make fighting forest fires and whale hunting boring. It is clear Junger owed the publisher a book and reached into his file cabinet and recycled old material."
3,Stalls midway through,"Sebastian Junger starts off strong with ""Fire,"" a book one comes to find is not devoted exclusively to the title subject.The initial essays are great, riveting even. The later ones, about his journalistic trevails abroad... well ... I'm stalled midway through them.I wish the author had been as compelled with the subject matter of ""Fire"" as he was with the plight of the Andrea Gail in ""A Perfect Storm."""
1,Sweepings off the floor,"I bought this book, hoping to find a ""Perfect Storm"" about smoke jumpers. What I found instead was a collection of feature articles with a tenuous connection to each other at best and of limited interest. The single exception to this is the last article, which is interesting in that it is about Afghanistan and the Taliban. Beyond that, you could pitch the whole book and not feel like you insulted it beyond what it deserved. Junger's publishing company was obviously trying to squeeze some more money out of Junger's name before he disappeared from view."
2,Overall disappointing,"Most of the negative reviews are right on. The title is misleading. The short stories are disjointed. And this book doesn't come close to the brilliance of Perfect Storm. Sure, there are a few flashes of this brilliance--but I do stress ""few"". Basically, the book consists of a series of short stories which were written by Junger as articles for magazines--mostly during the early 90s. Unfortunately, when you put them in the same book, it then becomes a hodgepodge of unrelated stories. I don't even think as articles, they would stand well on their own--once again, my opinion. The writing lacks the creativity, flow, and energy which Perfect Storm displays throughout. Maybe this book was put out quickly by Junger and publisher to earn some quick bucks--knowing it would sell based on his name only. I don't know. But I don't think this book deserves 1 star. It deserves 2 because there is some interesting reading in there."
5,Fire,As a former red card forest fire fighter I admire the research that Sebastian Junger put into the essay on forest fire fighting. The rest of the articles are extremely informative. Sebastian does an excellent job of showing the human aspects of events that I usually have only known about as news headlines. Definitely recommended.
2,"""""THE PERFECT STORM"""" THIS IS NOT!!","I know, I know, , ,it wasn't supposed to be. That is theproblem with loving an author's one book [""T-P-S] and notliking the next [""FIRE""]. Too many war / political stories forme, sorry. If that is your cup of tea, you'll love it.I really liked ""COLTER'S WAY""."
3,Dangerous jobs in the world.,"This is not a bad book, but it is not a great book either. Junger wrote well in The Perfect Storm, and followed this with a collection of articles written for magazines. These articles were well written, but they didn't have the pull that The Perfect Storm has.Junger did most of the investigation into these dangerous jobs after he was hurt in a tree accident. Forest fire fighters were his introduction piece and I was amazed how dangerous this job is. Junger follows with investigations into the conflicts in Afghanistan, the former Jugoslavia, and Cyprus. Then he makes a stab at whale hunting in St. Vincent.For such a short book, this collection of essays does not hold the imagination of the reader. Yes the articles are interesting and educational, but one can well read another book and get more interest."
3,Interesting but nothing special,"The book is a collection of magazine article the author wrote. They range from fire fighters in Idaho to guerilla fighters in Afghanistan. My personal favorite was one about a group of westerners who were kidnapped by muslim fundamentalists in the mountains of Kashmir and held as hostages.Many of the articles in the book are on subjects that have been well publicized and covered: Kosovo, Kashmir, Afghanistan, and Sierra Leone, but there also a couple less covered subjects, most notably whale hunting in the Carribean sea, which i particulary enjoyed. While the book does not provide much new insight into the well-covered events, it does provide an interesting glimpse into life in Cyprus (another article) and the world of whale hunting. I did not realize what a dangerous job whale hunting was until reading the book.Overall, it is worth reading ..."
5,Great Book!,This book is easy to understand and gives great step by step instructions for training. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to train their parrot and deepen their relationship with their featherd friend.
4,Great Quality!,"Excellent quality, made in Italy. But, the size Mediums seemed a little snug...Hope they stretch out (width wise)."
5,Over and over,"I love LTJ Bukem and can listen to his chill, intelligent music just about anytime, anywhere...These are old but good..."
4,LTJ fan since 1998,"I have purchased a good amount of LTJ Bukem/ MC Conrad music in the past, so this purchase was just to add to the collection. The 4-disc set gives one a good feel for what LTJ and the gang are capable of - great sounds placed well with smooth vocals. An excellent purchase for anyone who enjoys drum & bass music. LTJ and the GLO are definitely at the top of the D&B class."
3,Hypnotic Goodness,"I bought this album a couple of years ago and it didn't grab me at first listen. Perhaps I was listening too closely. Coklacoma works on more of an ambient level. Just put it on and do something else and it'll start to work on you. The loops and repeated samples will make you see what ""Comatone"", the active ingredient in the music (as the band puts it), is all about. It's not as dense and dancable as Severed Heads, at least later-period Severed Heads. Rather, this is light, sparse, and . . . well, strange. But we've all come to expect strangeness from Mr. Ellard."
1,"In-complete, Non-guide, totally Mis-titled","This book is totally mistitled -- it describes a number of craft projects that use adhesives that were used decades ago. It gives no systematic description of various adhesives, what is good for what surfaces, strength, temperature ranges, etc. Most of its info is totally out of date as of 2010 -- minimal discussion of epoxies, polyurethanes, and none about cyanoacrylate, silanes (strong silicone derivatives), newer polyvinyl types (Titebond III). Might have limited value for hobby crafters, but less than useless for serious maintenance purposes -- people who need and use glues for building and repairing things."
1,The Complete Guide to Glues and Adhesives,"The title of this book is a gross overstatement and highly misleading. It is in no way a complete guide to glues and adhesives. A more approiate title would be ""A Craft Persons Guide to Glues and Adhesives"" because thats all the book is. If you're not a craft person this book is not for you."
4,Forget the projects read about the glues,"I ordered this book after a student brought a copy to the collage class I teach at a local community college. I was taken aback by the cover photos which feature some fairly dreadful ""loving hands at home"" crafts as do many of the projects sprinkled throughout the text. BUT, the chapter by chapter information on specific types of glues and adhesives is thorough, extremely practical and makes this book a keeper. Clearly written. Lots of specific name brand citations, application hints, and references to producer's websites. I only wish that there were a new edition."
3,The Blu-Ray,"A most underwhelming Blu-ray transfer unfortunately. I was expecting/hoping for a sumptuous pristine picture but there's too much grain and noise on the picture. It's not awful but it's not Blu-ray standard! Sound is fine. Not a single extra, you don't even get a proper Menu. Why do they even bother wasting their time producing this sort of a release? Oh, that's right...to pilfer some quick cash out of our pockets and to insult a late, great director it would seem. On the up side, the more I watch this film the more I like it, so I'm sure I'll enjoy it even more when a decent transfer gets released, one day."
2,Monotonous except for the directing,"This movie was just painful to sit through. No real conflict is established until the murder is committed. It's just a bunch of ppl arguing with a bad parallel between the servants and their masters. There is nothing witty or even funny about the writing. There is no real mystery at all when he is killed because of the emphasis on a particular character and half the characters could've been taken out to move the movie along. The entire first hour sets up almost nothing and is just filler. However, Altman saved this wretched script by producing superb shots. That is the only redeeming quality about the movie."
1,Disappointment,"As a fan of Altman, and with all the critical praise preceding release of Gosford Park, it was with high expectations that I brough this DVD home recently. Very disppointed. Marble mouthed characters (subtitles may have helped) in whom it was difficult to develop a whit of interest. The corpse may have enlivened this dull movie, but couldn't stick with it that long."
2,"Bloody boring, if you ask me","I'm sorry to have seen so much good talent wasted on such a boring movie. I love Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren and wasn't disappointed in their performance - Maggie in particular is masterful, but the story is littered with boring, confusing, and tedious conversations, never seeming to build up to anything. I was determined to stick it out to the end just in case there should be an interesting development in the ""mystery"" - but no such luck. Don't waste your time and money on this one!"
4,The subtulties are key to appreciating this film,"While the first time I saw this movie I wondered what all the fuss was about, it has grown on me with repeat viewings. There are some easily missed subtlties (some of the dialog is hard to catch) which enrich the story. It is also easier to get into the story when you know the relationships between the characters, which may not be 100% clear on first viewing. Using the subtitles may help you capture the rich dialogue that give this film it's depth."
3,Speak Up!,"I suppose this is a wonderful movie but I'm not sure because I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD THE ACTORS ARE SAYING. The voices are quite muffled (I'm 40, so don't think I use a hearing aid or an ear horn). I can't even understand what Stephen Fry or Helen Mirren are saying, and I'm big fans of theirs. Disappointing. I feel like I'm not in on the big joke."
2,"Even though it is in English, it still needs subtitles",Visually it was beautiful. But we longed for English subtitles. Neither my wife nor I could follow the English dialects and with a murder mystery that is of critical importance for enjoyment.
3,For me it was just OK,"I love Downton Abbey so after seeing a interview with Jullian Fellows I thought I'd give the much talked about Gosford Park a shot. First, I know Jullian Fellows has his favorite actors but are there not more British actors for the minor rules? I love Maggie Smith and I'd watch her in just about anything but the minor roles are always filled by the same actors who are pretty much playing in the same period piece so it's getting boring.It was good but it's wasn't good enough to make me want to watch it again."
2,Too Long and Too Many Characters,"I was disappointed by this movie, primarily because: (1) it is at least thirty minutes too long, (2) there are too many characters to try to track, (3), The murder comes too late in the film (up to that point it is too talky), and (4) the murder mystery is not resolved when the movie finally ends.The BBC series Downton Abbey (shown on PBS and available on DVD) is much better."
2,Gosford Park,"Wonderful cast, costumes, setting-what is wrong with this picture? It's a non-movie, that's what. Sooo disappointed. I don't like making up my own endings. It's as if the director called ""cut,"" because he lost interest."
2,This was a disappointment,"After reading the write up, I anticipated a witty film with a calculated pace. I even watched it a second time just in case I was ""off"" the first time and still found the movie lacking in wit. Others suggested ""Remains of the Day"" and I'd also offer ""Mrs. Brown."""
5,Great English Upstairs/Downstairs Drama,"With a great ensemble cast, this film by Robert Altman is an outstanding film about the British upper class and how they lived may years ago. Written by Julian Fellows, the person writing Downton Abbey, the cast of Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and Clive Owen (and others)gives the viewer a treat of an evenings entertainment."
3,Some good moments but....,"Gosford Park is an interesting movie, it has the Upstairs Downstairs class depictions (though not as well done as the mini-series), good character development and a murder mystery which seems to be incidental to the whole film. Some good performances from all, especially Maggie Smith and Emily Watson, who stood out for me. My whole problem with this movie is that it takes so much time developing characters and setting the scene that the plot suffers as a result. I found the whole movie somewhat static, and it lacked direction and focus. I have never been a fan of Altman's, another director could have done better with this genre. It's a good film, it just cries out for editing."
5,Great Movie,What a wonderful piece of cinema. It is so smart. I wish more movies would made liek this one. The talent on this film film exudes from the screen. I laughed and cried. The extras are pretty good on this DVD. I especially enjoyed the commentary from Altman
5,"Excellent, jolly good indeed!","Agatha Christie type story told thru the upstairs and downstairs of a 1930s English Country Manor Home. Beautiful music throughout. A treasure, sure to be a classic, a must own."
3,A walk in the Park,"I like period pieces, however I found this one confusing, slow, and tedious. If it were not for the find performances of Maggie Smith, Kelley MacDonald, and Helen Mirran, this film would've wasted my time. A British game of Clue gets caught up in its own dialogue. As the movie explains difference between the classes. I must be missing something."
3,A 3.5 star film that was very intriguing,"This movie was very enjoyable even though not much happened until half way through the movie, but that's why Altman directed it and noone else. Excellent dialouge, excellent cast and one of the best period pieces I have ever seen. And what about that detective? Was it just me or was he channeling a little bit of Graham Chapman's Monty Python detective character?"
2,Agatha Christie would never have written this,"A previous reviewer refers to this film as a 'classical Agatha Christie whodunnit'. I'm sorry, but this is nonsense. Never would Agatha Christie, mistress of her craft, have written such a feeble mystery. For a start, the murder doesn't take place until more than halfway through the film, the detective when he appears is an idiot who couldn't detect his way out of a paper bag, and it's pretty obvious from the start who the murderer is, and why she did it. Pathetic. The film is riddled with cliches, all the upper-class characters are grim and repressed, all the working-class characters are warm, vibrant, life-loving etc. The film is just about worth watching for the performance of Maggie Smith, playing the only interesting character in the film, and the lovely Ivor Novello music. As a mystery, the film is hopeless."
3,"No so ""great""","I can't say anything that hasn't already been said, so I'll be brief.PRO's:- Extremely faithful atmosphere. Excellent cinematography.CON's:- Too damn long with no good reason to be so.- Muddy sound. The British characters seem to spend most of their time mumbling to themselves. You'll need to turn subtitles on to follow the story.- The story is just not that imaginative or good."
1,A silly film,"What could these first-rate British actors have been thinking of when they agreed to play meager parts in this second-rate Altman film! ... And American audiences and movie critics who fell all over themselves to extol this film! PLEASE! What was it, the accents?...Maggie Smith's character was bitchy and mean-spirited - a part she can play in her sleep. And to what purpose - to make fun of Ivor Novello (wonderfully played by Jeremy Northam), one of the few interesting characters in the film. Her part made no sense at all. When this film is reviewed again - say ten years from now - it will be seen as a shabby, hackneyed film."
3,I liked it but didn't love it,"I had just watched Downton Abbey Season 1, and thought I'd watch this movie which I missed when it came out. Maggie Smith was, as usual, fantastic. But I had difficulty understanding some of the dialogue in Gosford Park, (and no trouble when watching Downton Abbey). When I'd rewind it, I still couldn't understand what they were saying, it was so soft and quick.The storyline also didn't compare to Downton Abbey, and I kept trying not to compare them. But it's hard when they take place at the same time and basic setting!I'd have to agree with other reviewers that the plot was a bit predictable and boring. Good to watch on a rainy day when you have nothing better to do."
5,Arrived promptly. Looking forward to watching it again!,"After seeing Downton Abbey this past winter, I had a hankering to see Gosford Park again. Also the new Upstairs, Downstairs shown on Masterpiece Classic this year upped my interest. The DVD came promptly."
4,Entertaining,"Gosford Park is entertaining, though a bit slow in the plot at times. It does require a dose of knowledge of the British society before WWII. However, it is good as a murder mystery drama."
4,Quick...and yet slow,"The overall story is very slow--in the 2 hr, 17 minute movie, the actual murder takes place after the first hour. But, strangely enough, the story around you goes so fast you become desperate to find out who is who. It is extremely difficult to memorize all the characters-- I watched the movie twice and I'm not sure if I have half the characters names right.But despite the confounding dizziness of it all-- I was in love with the movie. As Director Altman states, it is not a ""whodunit"" sort of movie-- no no no. The point of the story was to create a murder mystery, in which everything is seen by the servants' POV. This is a wonderful technique, and it is executed fabulously. The servants' are not drab, and similar. Like real people, they all have different personalities. And as expected, everyone is not who they seem.And watch it a second time--it's better that way."
2,"Boy! Was I looking forward to this movie, but...","what a major disappointment. Not very hard to figure out 'who done it'. What's harder is figuring out why they spent ALL this time on it.Great cast. Fair acting (actually no acting ability was really necessary as there was no depth to any character, let alone the whole plot).Patiently waited for things to develop...and waited...and waited &, yet again, waited. Finally about 2/3s of the way through a murder took place. Wasted a lot of precious time hoping for better.Want a tip? Don't waste YOUR time."
1,"Veddy Poor Indeed, Eh What?!","I came to this film prepared by the trailer for something on the line of an Agatha Christy mystery. Nothing of the sort happens here. (The trailer HAD to be impactful and forward-moving, even if the movie is not, I realize.) What Gosford IS is Altman taking another tried and true genre, and trying to play it all ironic and sour and dispassionate and the-end-of-narrative-as-we-know-it, ala The Long Goodbye. (Veddy '70s of the old boy, I do declare.)If your interest was piqued by the trailer for Gosford, I can almost guarantee you that this film will disappoint your expectations. If you are the type who like films that take no sides, tell no stories and drift along until they simply cease, then you may like this film. Or you may at least be able to act as if you do. --Which, among circles of people who enjoy talking about film more than watching it, is the entire bailiwick, as it were, no?"
2,Please Stop With the Singing Already!,"I wasn't able to make it though this poor excuse for a movie. Everything is dragged out soooo long -- the pheasant shooting scene and the after-dinner singing guest -- each goes on for way longer than they should and I was bored to death! I couldn't imagine what anyone would find enjoyable about this movie unless their own life was moving so slowly that this seemed compatible to them. Many fine stars have totally wasted performances (Helen Mirren, for one). Avoid."
2,I don't like it.,"I have only watched about 30 minutes of it. I do not like it so far. Not sure I will even watch the rest. I am very disappointed. The reviews I read made it sound really good. I love Downton Abbey also written by Julian Fellows so I was sure I would like it, but so far, NO. It is very slow moving, lots of small talk that doesn't seem to mean much. Some bad language I wasn't expecting and didn't appreciate."
1,It put me to sleep,"Ok, I don't expect many people to rate this review as ""helpful"". All I want to say is this thing put me to sleep pretty fast, and the dialogue is so muffled, I had to crank the volume all the way up and still couldn't make it all out.As for the movie itself, it reminded me of a boring British television drama. It was unappealing from the start, and never got my attention afterwards. This seemed to be a movie for your stodgy Aunt Millie. As for why it got Oscar nominations: Two words: Altman and BORING.You may want to keep this in mind when considering my opinion: I didn't pick this movie up--a friend brought it over, as it is not something I would bother with on my own to begin with. I generally don't care for high-brow period pieces (i.e., Dangerous Liasons)."
2,THIS IS WHY A VOID STAMP WOULD BE USEFUL.,"IT'S EASY FOR SOMEONE TO LOOK AT THIS FILM AND SAY IT'S WELL MADE. BUT HOW CAN SUCH A BORING FILM BE CONSIDERED 'WELL MADE' WHEN IT DOESN'T EVEN DO IT'S JOB. YES A MOVIE HAS A JOB, AND THAT JOB IS TO ENTERTAIN. I WAS NOT ENTERTAINED. I'M OF THE OPINION THAT ANYONE THAT WAS ENTERTAINED BY THIS MOVIE, COULD ALSO BE ENTERTAINED BY WATCHING PAINT DRY. AFTER I WATCHED GOSFORD PARK I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT MUST OF BEEN A BAD YEAR FOR MOVIES. BECAUSE IF THIS WAS AMONG THE BEST FIVE FILMS (OSCARS) OF 2001, I SERIOUSLY NEED TO LISTEN TO MORE MUSIC."
1,said what?,"Am quite used to English speak, but this one was a jumble of mumbles and very hard to understand - turned if off after about twenty minutes-will try again if they come out with a clearer version"
1,"If you don't have a story, don't tell it","I'm a fan of much of Robert Altman's work, and when I went to see this film I had fairly high expectations. However, what I got was a couple of hours of dull storyline. The ""big surprise"" was probably supposed to provide a great twist at the end, but anyone still awake will have figured it out mid-way through the movie. There seems to be potential in this period piece, but in the end it's just a pointless story with little to recommend it. As I said to my friends after leaving the theater, ""If you don't have a story, don't tell it."" The most shocking thing was that this worthless movie was nominated for Oscars!"
1,lousy movie,hard to follow-not nearly as good as Downton Abbey.Would not reccommend to anyone even my enemiesslow down the dialog next time
3,Surprisingly different,"This has the look and feel of English ""who-done-it"". It is as much the society as it is a mystery. The first quarter of the movie is just introductions to the characters as they approach the manor. Then the discussions start as they are settling in and the sub plots show up but do not overwhelm the main story. If you are trying g to guess ahead forget it. Also plan for every English cliché.I suggest that you use the closed caption option the first time through as the mumble a lot and the background music is louder than the speech tract. Don't be surprised to find that it has ended just as you are getting into it.The DVD extras add a dimension to the movie as after watching them you can view the movie with out the sub tittles."
3,Has its moments,This is not Downton Abbey. It is much shallower and jumps around at times. But it is still a fun experience.
1,impossible to follow,"I found the movie impossible to follow for a couple of reasons. The characters come in the beginning in such profusion they are difficult to later identify and many of them tend to look much alike. I read the Wikipedia summary but even that didn't much help. One that does stick in mind is the pretty boy butler played by Ryan Phillippe, but only because he has a fake Scots accent and as usual isn't very good. Another problem is that most talk ""sotto voce"" so that it is almost impossible to understand what they are saying. If there were subtitles that defect could be overcome but there are only Spanish, not English, subtitles. I contrast this fiasco with another movie about a great English house, Remains of the Day, that is a marvelous movie. I'd give GP a 1 and Remains of the Day a 5. No real comparison."
4,Like Downton Abbey? You will love this movie,I am in love with Downton Abbey because I watched this movie years ago and didn't want it to end. Juliann Fellows is a part of both the movie and the series.
1,wasnt able to view,"This dvd came from Germany, I think, would not play in player, said was the wrong region, This was not specified in description before ordering. Very disappointed, costs more to ship back than I paid for it."
3,RYAN PHILLIPE,this movie would have been ok if ryan phillipe and his horrible attempt at a scottish accent wasn't in it. i hate that guy more than spiders. and i'm a person who really hates spiders. jerk.
1,Utterly boring...,"I am a fan of Julian Fellowes writing and was looking forward to viewing this film. After 30 minutes of tedium, I turned it off and have no plans to try it again. Utterly boring and a total waste of money."
2,What a waste,"What a waste of millions of dollars and some of the world's finest actors. This tediously long film is a mixture of Upstairs-Downstairs and Agatha Christie. Altman just doesn't understand either the upstairs or downstairs people. His ""sexy"" scenes are embarrassingly dumb. Some of the dialogue is unintelligible, especially when it is delivered by people pretending to be from Scotland. And at the end, when three people ""rip off their masks,"" so to speak, and are really other people, the dialogue is so clumsy that if you look the other way for a second you'll miss the plot summation. This is a film that deserves to be listed in the Turkey book, under the title Most Expensive. It fails to be amusing, insightful, or even entertaining. The worst part is the script, and so, predictably, the writer received an Academy Award,"
1,One of the biggest disappointments ever,"This movie just ends up being nothing. It's a comedy that isn't funny, a drama that isn't dramatic, and a mystery that isn't that mysterious. I jsut felt like I had wasted 2 hours when I left the theater, and thats never a good sign."
5,Masterful,"Perusing the reviews for ""Gosford Park"" I wasn't surprised to see several complaints of boredom. It might sound stupid, but anyone who found this film boring is not Robert Altman's intended audience. Gosford Park is a masterpiece of subtlety and exquisite attention to detail; it requires patience and focus on the part of the viewer. The entertainment is there on the screen; it's up to the individual to discover it.""Gosford Park"" succeeds in bringing together two completely different worlds that rarely, if ever, collide. The languid upstairs sphere hovers just above the much more crowded and lively below stairs universe. To watch the ballet dance between the two is to watch genius at work."
2,Terrible Blu-ray transfer,"I just received my blu-ray version of Gosford Park and found its quality to be very lacking. I compared it to my DVD version and there was a very small improvement in the picture quality, but not much. The blu-ray also lacked any extras and the closed caption feature did not work. It's still a great movie, but a terrible blu-ray transfer and I would recommend that you don't buy it."
3,not a bad flick,"its only downfall is that its a long movie, but a solid plot - a little slow at the beginning, but once you get through that, the storyline just sucks you in."
4,"Rich, enjoyable, satiric Altman mystery","I wish Amazon allowed 4.5 stars. That would feel more appropriate. Yes this is arguably not quite a great movie, but its certainly a very good, very enjoyable one. Wonderfully acted by an amazing ensemble cast, and shot with delicate grace, It may not add up to more than the sum of it's parts, and the murder mystery that takes up the last 30 minutes is more obvious and less graceful than what precedes it. But its so full of funny and occasionally moving moments, wonderful bits of dialogue, and tremendous texture, that it's lack of a deeper punch, while slightly disappointing, takes little away from a terrific film."
4,It's Better on the third or forth viewing,"It takes a while to figure out who everyone is and their relationships with each other, after all it is an ensemble cast of over 30, so watch it the first time through to find out ""who done it"". Then watch it again and again to really figure things out and to pick up on all the wonderful details that you missed the first few times. The trailer seems to lead you to believe this is a comedy, but it is a first class drama that hapens to revolve around a murder.And yes, Jeremy Northam does his own singing in this movie and displays a lovely tenor voice that was really surprising."
4,Good mystery and portrait of upper-class English life,"There's plenty of suspense and drama without any gratuitous violence. It was difficult to understand the English accent at times, but the main points are repeated often enough that the gist of each situation is easy enough to surmise."
3,Beautiful to look at,"Beautiful film,but one must watch carefully the many characters or you get lost.I was expecting something like Downton Abbey.DVD. Quality is great."
5,Film-School Freebie,"We've been dottie for Gosford since it came out, for its humor, for its characters, and for its mordant comment on the grind that we are all in. But we also knew it was a miracle of film-making, and the DVD clarifies why. Visit with Bob Altman, Bob Balaban, and Julian Fellowes, and have a free year at a great film-school, watching as they conceive, develop, and then accomplish the magical feat of taking you to another world and letting you live there, if only for an hour and a half. And the old tunes of Ivor Novello, performed to perfection by the brothers Northam, are worth the price of the film. ""There was a Roman hero, who had shaken hands with Nero...."""
2,bad dvd,"there is something wrong with this dvd, despite it being sold as new. the audio doesn't always come on at the beginning and needs to be prompted by re-starting."
3,Gosford Park DVD,DVD was delivered quickly and no trouble with shipping package but DVD stops and then skips about 10 seconds in a couple of different places.
3,Gosford Park,"Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Kristen Scott Thompson, Michael Gambon,Emily Watson, man, just an A list of British superstars headline this movie about interactions between the rich and the servants that live in the belowstairs. I thought it was well done, just a bit busy at times. Kelly Macdonald I haven't seen before, but her scenes were quite good also, especially with Owen."
2,GosBORED Park,"(Sigh...) Another movie that has received a lot of hype, and surprise surprise, fails to live up to it. Trying to keep track of the characters, especially their names...ha!, is so frustrating that I felt like turning off the movie then. But I didn't and continued on.There are a lot of talented English actors...many of whom I have barely heard of nor care to see in another movie. Everything about this movie is like its predecessor, Clue. People are invited to a large house, yada yada yada, someone's killed, yada yada, whodunit??This is the boring, British version of Clue. I cannot recommend it because it is boring, difficult to follow, difficult to give a damn about any of the characters (truthfully, did there only have to be ONE murder? I was hoping everyone but the butler would get it!!!). Anyway, that's that."
1,BOORING,Couldn't follow the story since everyone muttered so much and called each other by their formal names... I turned it off before anyone was murdered... couldn't waste two hours of my life.
1,Won't play on my dvd player,"I would love to see this video as I ordered it for that purpose. But it won't play on my DVD player...it keeps saying: ""WRONG REGION"" when I hit play. Going to see if I can get it replaced."
1,4 DEFECTIVE VERSIONS OF THIS FILM,"I have ordered this film, which I am sure is very good, from Amazon twice...each time ordering two dvds.....ALL FOUR FILMS HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE...THEY HAVE NO SOUND...I SENT THE FIRST ORDER BACK, RECEIVED ANOTHER ORDER, STILL WITH NO SOUND...BUYER BEWARE"
4,No Upstairs Downstairs,"Comment: If you have seen ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" you know what I mean when I say that this is not that show. Where ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" was a series you could ""love""... Gosford Park is a movie based on that premise, but you can hate it with the same enthusiasm that you love ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". It is common, nasty, ruthless and dare I say probably closer to the truth than ""Upstairs, Downstairs""... or that the times became after the era of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". The story became hard to follow, not because of the story itself... but rather the bad muffled quality of the sound during the gathering of more than one or two cast members at a time. In halls and in rooms where there is a lot of people and things going on such as a party, the dialog is frightfully muffled which makes some important facts hard to come buy. All in all it is a good movie on par with ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" but brings out a different feeling in the end."
3,"If you like Materpiece Theater, you'll like this.","Altman's trademark is the interweaving of plot and dialogue, laying the various levels over one another. It works well where the dialogue can be understood, but in this Upstairs/Downstairs film the strong English accents, especially downstairs, make it difficult to understand much of what is being said. That, of course, is the way it is in real life (""What did she say?""), but it's an irritant in a film.As other reviewers have pointed out, very little actually happens in this film; those expecting action should look elsewhere. It is a period piece along the lines of Masterpiece Theater, but with far better photography and more intelligent conversation. As is often the case with Altman, some elements seem contrived (the presence of the Hollywood director), which detracts from the otherwise fine performance of the actors involved."
3,Disappointing,It wasn't as good as i thought it would be. Since it was supposed to be the inspiration for Downton Abby I expected it to be much more entertaining than it was.
1,Disappointment,"My girlfriend and I picked up this movie. We made the decision based on the awards this movie has won. To be honest, I don't see why it won so many awards. It either didn't have much competition or someone paid someone else off. There is no character development and seemingly no plot. Just a bunch of pompus rich people and their servants.I wasn't renting this for car chases or gun fights, I was looking for an intellectually deep movie, and was utterly disappointed."
3,disappointing end and just not my cup of tea,"started out to be a decent mystery, but it really is a tale of the corrupt norms of the upper class. For me it had too much sex going on. The casual attitudes toward it detractedfrom the enjoyment of the story but were anintegral part of it. Enjoyed Maggie Smith & Jeremy Northam immensely as always though."
2,"BORING, Takes too long to get to the point","It's watchable, but takes too much time to get the story line going. My time is valuable. I fell asleep twice and had to go back to catch up. A rental for a slow Sunday afternoon."
3,That's five stars for period detail; one star for content,"I've never cared greatly for those movies where they assemble a lot of name stars and give them each five minutes of screen time, and we're supposed to be impressed by how brilliant they all are in their cameos. I never became interested in any of these people, with the exception of Jeremy Northam's Ivor Novello, who had a charm that was utterly wasted among these well-draped icycles. Bored and desperate Upstairs or cheeky and snobbish Downstairs, they played to type, and the lesson that the classes were hopelesly intertwined was made clear within the first few minutes. It was not amusing; it was unpleasant, watching people be carelessly brutal to each other for two hours. The point of the murder seemed to be that anyone could have done it (it was easy to figure out who had) and no one cared. Nor did I."
2,"Good story, Bad presentation","The story and cast are good. I was attracted to this title because it was written by Julian Fellowes, the creator and writer of Downton Abby, the sensational Masterpiece Theatre serial shown on PBS. This film disappointed because the dialog was difficult (or impossible) to hear or decipher, throughout the picture. Sub-titles were NOT available either. There is a large cast of characters, many of the men and women looking enough alike so it took 3/4 viewings for me to sort it all out and figure out most of the relationships in the picture. I am still not sure about some of the characters in the subplots? I would quickly buy another version, if it was offered with subtitles."
2,"Very, very slow -","We love British movies and TV shows, but this movie is very dull and slow paced. I went to sleep watching it. Maggie Smith is always brilliant and was the bright spark of the movie. A little like Downton Abby, but with a very weak plot."
3,"good film, disappointing dvd",I bought the Blue Ray of this film because I'm getting hard of hearing and I wanted the captioning for the hard of hearing found on most blue ray discs. The advertising blurb for this dvd doesn't mention that there is no captioning. too badIt took an exceptionally long time for this dvd to finally arriveAmazon's service is usually quite good- this was a disappointment all around
2,Lacks focus,"This movie is frustrating to watch. There are so many characters that it should have provided viewers with a complementary roster. Also, the British accents get in the way of American comprehension. The movie lacks a concentration on any of the characters and when the end comes, viewers will be asking ""so what"" and ""what's the point?"" A murder mystery made boring."
5,Gosford,"My God, what a delight, I had tried many times in life to be a little like Maggie Smith playing one of these aristocrats"
1,DISAPPOINTED,"THE ACTORS DIDN'T ENUCUATE WELL, CAUSING A DIFFICULTY FOR AN AMERICAN ENGLISH SPEAKING GUY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HALF OF THE BRITISH ENGLISH SPEAKING ACTORS SAID. NO SUBTITLES EITHER, TO HELP. WATCHED ONLY 1/2 OF IT AND JUST TURNED IT OFF; NOT WORTH WATCHING THE 2ND HALF. THANKS FOR DOWNTON ABBEY HAVING SUBTITLES.I'D GIVEN THE DISK AWAY FOR ANYONE WHO'LL PAY THE POSTAGE TO GET IT FROM ME."
1,BEST EVA,"BOB Altman is the greatest living or dead director of all time and I worship the film he walks on. Everything he has ever done is wonderful and this is the most wonderfulist film ever. It is just wonderful. The acting is Wonderful the cinematography is wonderful the directions are wonderful, it's just wonderful.BAH TWADDLE PIPNow lay off you fanboys. I did not like this movie. Though it is very interesting to see just how big an industry an English country estate really was. But as a film it lacks wit. John Cleese was good but not enough to make this a good movie. I am sorry but I have come to the inevitable conclusion that I just do not like Robert Altman's work. In future I shall avoid anything he has directed since MASH.Why are a wise man and a wise guy opposites?"
1,Absolutely Terrible&#65533;A Collosal BOMB,"I don't care how stylish the sets-how great the acting-to see this film again in order to ""understand"" it would be a waste of my time. It stunk. The plot is lame and predictable, there is not one character worth caring about and the most likable actor was the dog. This was an exercise in self-massaging of Altman's ego-he has been known to have done that before. Next time I suggest he think twice before sending one of his ""ideas"" (see the creative credits at the start of the film) to the screen. How do you spell pew as in stinky? Also, I don't think subtitles would have helped me to understand this piece of drivel-lame lame lame."
2,"Good cast,bad storyline","The good news is that the movie had a good cast,the bad news,the story itself.I was upset Helen Mirren wasn't given more time in the movie.When it came to the sex scenes,watered down.The police detective in the movie is even worse than Peter Sellers charcater in the Pink Panther movies.I even had a hard time getting into the story.Only the Cazalets had the best sex scenes and there are other British movies with better storylines."
5,reminds me heart-warming scene of Disney movies....very good,"The music of Disney's movies is the one of the most important things in it. This CD has so many love songs used in Disney's movies, so each songs reminds me the hart-warming scene...when you close your eye and listen to it. The conditions of recording is very nice. It is much better for BGM if you have a family with kids. You may think it is a little expensive...but it has so many great songs nearly 20, so I think it is reasonable price."
4,"McCulloch MS1415 14"" 8-Amp Electric Chain Saw",Product is everything I expected. Only reason for witholding one star is I don't know how it will hold up under use.
4,Nice little chainsaw,"I bought this to help get our overgrown yard into shape, and it has been very easy to use."
5,Perfect For The Job!,"Honestly, I purchased this little chain saw to carry along in our 5er RV. Always in need for a ""quiet"" chain saw to slice up a log or two, (not wanting to disturb the peace and quiet in the RV Park).I have also used it around the yard and it truly does a great job. I must say well worth the $$$ paid. Only negative is dragging the cord around, but I knew that before my purchase. A very heavy duty, solid, and well built unit.You know how they say ""You get what you pay for, in most cases."" Well, in this case ""I got more than what I paid for"". Would buy another in a heartbeat. Good buy!"
2,Warning,I was disassembling a tree that had fallen after a bad storm. It was the first time I had used the saw. It worked great for the first half hour on the small limbs. Then the chain came loose when using on a thicker/larger limb.
5,McCulloch chain saw works well,I have used this chain saw several times now and with favorable results. It is sharp and seems to have enough power. I am completely satisfied so far.
4,Electric chainsaw,Very powerful for its size and it is easy to operate. Only complaint is the chainsaw oil leaks out during storage and makes a mess
2,Not the complete story,"If you love trains and you are looking for beautiful photography this is the video for you. If you would like to know more about what you are seeing, look elsewhere. The narration on this video is very minimal. We kept wishing the narrator would tell us the name and location of the trains we were seeing. We would also have enjoyed some vintage film of the eary 20th century trains and more interior shots.Some of the background music is beautiful and some of it is extremely annoying.This just wasn't what we were expecting in a video that claims to be ""the complete story of passenger trains in America""."
1,Christian Opinion,"As a committed Christian, I found this book to be obscene, written by a depraved, obsessed person. I read about the first 10 pages in shock, then after some deliberation, destroyed the book as I didn't want anyone else to read it. Horrific! And supposedly written by a Christian!"
1,not worth it,way smaller than it was suppose to be. approx 14 X10 inches long. way smaller than advertised size. you are way better off screwing some driftwood together to make it appropiate size for your tank. im not even going to use this piece. way over rated. if you look up home made driftwood turtle docks from a guy who makes them on a red ear slider website. make one from his designs. much better and only costs a few cents to make. mine was made with two pieces of straping and driftwood or dried wood from the woods. the turtles enjoy it way more as well.
3,Sizes vary greatly!!,"I was a little disappointed in the sizes.I ordered two of the large and one measured 18""x6"" (108 sq in) and the other 22""x9"" (198 sq in).Sure they look nice, BUT I thought that they would be larger or not have one piece almost twiceas larger as the other."
1,Not Pleased!,"I bought the extra large piece. I did not think it would be considered an extra large piece and when I measured, it was only 12x10x1. There was also a crack through the whole thing. If my turtle tried to climb on, it would probably break. I have had a hard time finding a turtle dock big enough for my turtle and was very disappointed with this product!"
2,False advertising,"Measurements were extremely off. Item is listed as 24x24x1 inch Bought this to put in my turtle tank and it was way too small, not even close. The item arrived in a timely manner, but it's sitting in cabinet not being used."
3,"Not at all ""Extra Large""","This ""Extra Large"" cork bark really isn't large at all. It's quite small actually, so the description is extremely misleading. Floats nice and would be good for a little turtle, not my big turtle."
3,not flat,"the bark is no where near FLAT, it is shaped like a tunnel , but it worked out ok for my turlte who is about 6 inches long. I drilled some holes in the sides of it and hung it with fishing line on the outside of tank with some sticky hooks it works great keeps her out of the water even though she is pretty heavy!"
1,It's a flop,"Thought this might be a timesaver to use on our fleet of state cars. What a disappointment. Thankfully we didn't order a case. Directions have you wash the vehicle, spray each panel a couple of times with the wax and then wipe off the water. By magic it's supposed provide a wax finish. Well, there was no magic nor a shiny finish. Tried putting the buffer to it to bring out the shine but got nothing to brag about. Also, tried it after a vehicle was dry like a standard wax but this stuff went on like nice smelling water and worked about the same way. We'll stick to good ol' reliable Turtle Wax for the fleet and Meguiar's Tech 2.0 for staff cars."
2,Not Very Useful,Had to purchase this for my MBA Management Science course. I have only referred to it a couple of times and I haven't found it very useful. I will still keep it though for when I go back to work in case I need a reference.
2,Out of date and limited...,"There's the possibility that this book was right on the mark for what it was created. I however needed it for a class. It didn't help clarify the subject in the least. The material in the book was not very well explained and thus didn't stand on its own. The instructions for the exercises were windows excel 2003 specific, so I had to not only switch from my beloved mac to a pc, but then had to revert back to the 2003 version just so the step-by-step procedures would be relevant. Other than that, I'm sure it was awesome and insightful. All in all though the scope was so narrow I would not recommend this edition.I have also considered my views might be bias, but seemed to share in the idea amongst classmates that not much was gained from this book in regards to the decision support systems class. Perhaps that has more to do with who the class utilized the book rather than the potential of the book itself. For that reason, I changed my rating from 1 star to 2."
1,Not one of his better efforts,"I believe that Emeril has slipped just a little bit. This book is grand in concept, but somewhat lacking in substance. He may be so busy trying to keep his shows going, his personal appearances, all of his restaurants, etc that he has lost a little bit of his true creative edge. Most of the recipes in here are ambitious, but they tend to miss the mark. He has taken some of the fun of innovating and run wild with it, to the point that it is counterproductive. I would advise Emeril to take a break for a little while and get back to the kitchen to do some real cooking. He should get back in touch with the basics that are so vital to true Louisiana cooking. The 'creative' dishes that he has been displaying lately on his show and the recipes in this book are indicative of how he has gone just a little overboard."
2,WHERE ARE THE PICTURES OF THE FOOD?,This book features many pictures of unidentified good times but no pictures of the food being featured. I have tried four receipes and of the four only one turned out as it was described. I would not recommend this one.
4,COOK BOOK REVIEW,"I have one other E.L. cookbook and I enjoyed this one, too. However, I would have rated it higher if photographs of the dishes were included. Great history and insight to holidays, special occasions. Easy to understand recipes."
5,ALWAYS PARTY TIME IN LOUISIANA,"My Father was born and raised in Louisiana, Opelousas to be exact so I was raised on great cooking. I have all of Emerils cookbooks as well as some of Cheif Paul's. There is so many different kinds of food and meals in this one. Most of the ingrediants a Cajun usually keeps at his house. They are simple to make and so far live up to what I would consider a party food to be. If I could make just one suggestion, there have been a few ingrediants mentioned for some of the recipes that I have never heard of and would like some way of finding substitutions for these. Keep up the good work Emeril and goodness knows that we do not need to see pictures of the food, we just always know that they will be great. Sincerely, Connie Halphen Harber"
4,"Excellent, Informative, Great Recipes","I loved this book. It has stories about Emeril's background, history, what goes on in Louisiana all throughout the year, his Mom and Dad (Hilda and John) and pictures. I really like some of the recipes - I haven't tried them all of course, but the ones I have are great - especially some of the desserts! Even if you don't ever make the recipes, read the stories about each month and his background....if you watch Emeril every night like I do, you'll love it!"
1,Interesting ...,"This isn't what I'd thought it would be. It aint nothing but pictures of Emeril and other party pictures. There arent any new recipes in this book. Emeril's the man, he can do better than this."
1,Frightening!,"This book was scary! My arteries were clogging just reading it! Every recipe, and I mean EVERY recipe is listed as an 'old time Louisiana tradition', even the flautas! That makes sense. There are LOTS of pictures in this book, and not enough recipes. However, the recipes that did make it are not really suitable for celebrating with."
4,Every Day is a Party,"This is ""classic"" Emeril! Entertaining, informative, and over the top! His style abounds in this book. It is far more than a cookbook. It is a glimpse into Emeril the man. For those who criticize this book or Emeril, perhaps they can do better. I would be the first to buy any of their books should they accept the challange. Emeril's cookbooks are like Emeril, ""happy, happy, happy!"" This book will be on my Christmas ""giving"" list!"
4,Emeril shares his joie de vivre again.,"New Orleans is very lucky that adopted son Emeril Lagasse is such a tireless good will ambassador.People who enjoy his show and who share is passionate outlook on life and food will enjoy this book with its ""party through the year"" format. Color photos make me wish I were there to join the fun. Lighten up, people, and smell the roses (and the gumbo) while you may."
1,YUCK!,Save your money and buy Emeril's New New Orleans Cuisine. It is obvious that Emeril no longer cares about his recipies and is simply out to make a quick buck.
1,What?,"This is not the book that I'd recommend to anyone. How much more commercial can you get? Now, we are getting ready to be asaulted with 'Emeril' as a sitcom. Emeril used to be a pretty entertaining cook, now he is nothing more than a corporate cartoon out there shucking 'his' wares. It wouldn't surprise me if this book was written by a team of corporate hacks. ....This book was BAD!"
1,Emeril's book,"My friends at work gave me this book for a going away present, bu t I wasn't leaving the company. I really don't know how to cook and had a hard time following the recipes. Emeril uses too many ingredients and it is hard to figure out what to do. The pictures in the book were nice, but it didn't show how to make the dishes. I wish Emeril included National Airplane Day as one of his holidays."
3,No visual appeal,"This book lacks pictures of the featured recipes. There are several pictures of New Orleans and people, but none of the completed dishes. If you're like me, pictures are what draw you towards preparing a recipe. What's a cookbook without food photographs?"
1,Party Time,"Has he no shame? What was the man thinking? This book is a very sparse collection of over blown, in-your-face recipes loosely tied to various holidays and festivals. Nice pictures in the book, but on the whole not worth the cover price. This should not be included as a cookbook, but rather a coffee table book or an author's vanity piece."
1,"This will go on the shelf, not in the kitchen.","There are plenty of pictures, but none of them are food related. That is a HUGE turn off. It would be nice to know what a cooked quahog should look like."
4,Wide range of recipes for various tastes,"While I wouldn't use every recipe in this book, the variety is extensive enough that you can find just about anything to match your tastes. I've used the pizza dough recipe and it came out a little more like the crust you'd expect on a frozen pizza, but the gumbo ya-ya recipe is a keeper."
4,Fit for a mechanic,"Good details and helpful for the novice and experienced. A bit too much detail for the novice but it helps doing simpler jobs. Would be nice to have a ""Harley for Dummies"" for those of us who just need some help with throttle adjustment, oil changes, lamp replacement and other simpler jobs that don't require special tools and diagnostics."
3,Lacking user insight,"Well written as a technical guide, but lacking in ""aftersale"" user advice as setup indications and suggestions."
1,Revelations or revenge?,"I am not a follower of any faith healer. In fact, I look for any information about exploitation of people by false methods of healing. The title of this book, BEHIND THE SCENES, THE TRUE FACE OF THE FAKE HEALERS led me to believe that information would be given by investigators who had researched and observed false practices in the area of healing. Instead, I found the content to be a complaint by the author of his being ignored by Benny Hinn (this occasion being mentioned repeatedly) and a rambling treatise about many various healers with no objective reporting at all. He wanders through his own personal troubles, again emphasizing how he has not found acceptance in the ""healing community"" that he would like to find. I found that the money spent on this book was a total waste!"
4,"readable and informative, abounding in illustrations","The writing is clear and readable; the book would be accessible to a 7th grader, upward. The book is essentially an extended encyclopedia entry. The conventional account is asserted; no (or little) debate of facts burdens the story. It contains numerous illustrations of high quality, including maps with Alexander's movements delineated."
3,Churchill's Triumph,"As a collector of Winston S. Churchill memoribilia, this book (novel)was an excellent addition to my WSC library. The transaction was quick and very smooth. The book arrived prior to the estimated date and it was in the condition as stated in the item description. I would purchase from this seller again!"
1,Not wroth the time!,"The weakness of the History and the ennui of the sub-plot does not a ""Triumph"" make."
1,Peurile,"This book, while clearly painstakingly and thoroughly researched, was just plain terrible. Michael Dobbs would have the reader believe that FDR was a doddering idiot, Stalin interested in nothing but gamesmanship, and Churchill governed almost completely by the emotion of the moment. Mr. Dobbs needs to think more deeply about the behavior and motivations of real people. Instead, he has presented us with cardboard cutouts who, if they were as preoccupied with trivia and self-involved as he indicates, would never have reached the positions of power that they did. This book insults the intelligence of anyone who has studied history seriously."
4,"Solid Introduction to Economic Indicators, although dated","This book is an easy read and it is a great introduction to economic indicators. Unfortunately, it is out of date. It gives a description of what each indicator actually measures, who produces the indicator, and why it is important to the stock, bond, and currency markets.It is a very quick read (less than a day) and can be used to refresh one's memory on the basic econ indicators.It also includes an in-depth discussion of how the Fed actually regulates the money supply. This is one of the better introductions to the Fed's operations that I have read.I recommend quickly reading this book whenever you need a refresher course on the very basics of what to look for in economic indicators, especially with respect to how they affect the markets."
3,Good Economic/Starter Set,"Nice sturdy drum and bag for the price. However, the swivel is pretty cheap (mostly plastic) and broke after a few weeks--easily replaceable however. Also be warned that this is designed to be mounted on standard wall studs and does NOT include the screws needed to attach it to the wall. The instructions suggest 1/4"" x 1 3/4"" Lag Bolts (you need 6 of them). So if you're planning on installing this the day you get it, make sure you have the screws, a power drill, a stud finder, etc."
2,Only partially ok,"After a few months the bag deflated and Everlast could have cared less. The swivel is terrible. It unscrews as you hit the bag and the action sucks. If you buy this set, replace the swivel and buy a leather bag."
1,"Hit it, break it, get your refund.",The speed bag that comes with this package is complete garbage. Be sure to set it up right away and do about one hour of normal speed bag work. That will be enough to break the plastic loop that attaches the bag to the swivel. There should be a law against products like this but since there is none just be ready with your receipt when it breaks like mine did.
5,ACDelco PF61 Oil Filter,The AC filter is not always available in your local automotive shops. Nice to know you can find it on line.
3,DEA,Flow is tight I guess I just wish he didn't get kicked out of MOOD. He is a dope EMCEE with a big mouth.
5,Have used Denman brushes for a lifetime.,"Happy that the Denman product is still available, I've been using these brushes for over 50 years. The large was a good choice and my hair has never been healthier with natural bristle mix."
4,Essential Brush,"The brush is good for stimulating the scalp, the handle was too small. I'm going to order the large one."
4,Good Brush,"I like this brush but wish it was a little harder. When I comb the back of my head, the brush isn't hard enough to comb through to my scalp. I also purchased the Denman Large Bristle Cushion Brush (8 row) for my sister and I think i like that one better."
5,Very nice. Magnet could be a bit stronger.,"I finally found a case to fit my smallest camera: this one. I am very happy with this case. It is nicely made and looks great. Its flap closes with a magnet, which I wish was stronger.Not obvious from the product page:This case is mostly nappa leather.There is a sturdy belt loop on the back.There is a small opening in the top flap to accommodate your camera's wrist strap."
5,oneof my faves,ok yes caitlin is a snobby rich brat in this book but she gradually gets better .. yes in the beginning i didnt like her shes the one everyone hates cuz they wish they were her .. but u grow to like her .. then in the next two books she still makes mistakes yes but she is a lovable heroine .. then u have the next triolgy and its another of my favs where she goes with jed to his ranch ... then the 3rd trilogy and ive only ever read the first two cuz my library and or used book stores never had the last one ... until a year or so ago i never even saw the cover for te last one and so it leaves me hanging at the 2nd book in the last trilogy.. i am hoping to buy it soon as i have been waiting to read the last book to the series for many years.. its a great romance and would recomend it definately .. off i go to take them off the shelf for another read ...lol
5,Great Book! Worth reading.,"I thought this was an original book. With a great plot line. Although I haven't read the other two books in the series, judging by this one, I trust I will not be dissapointed. And yes, at first I did find Caitlin a bit of a snob, but then, I truly felt sorry for her."
1,Cold Caitlin,"When Francine Pascal advertised her new series,Caitlin,she described Caitlin as a dazzling Sweet Valley Jessica type.What we got instead was someone completely dull and boring.Cold too.And the book is just as boring.Sorry...:-("
4,Elder Brother: a biography of C.W. Leadbeater,"Mr. Tillet does an admiral job in producing the first biographyof C.W. Leadbeater. He is balanced in his approach to thislarger that life person. He supports his conclusions based oncarefully researched information. Some of his conclusions maynot be appreciated by Theosophists, but they are real nonethe less. I heartly recommend this book for anyone who wishesto know more about Leadbeater."
3,great product,love the product but the packaging is poor. wish it had come in a re-closable container. need to purchase a container to store it in.
4,Lives up to its title,"I wish I'd had this book when I started using Photoshop Elements 3. As 15-year Windows veteran with experience with two other photo-editing packages, I found Elements to be far from intuitive. ""The Missing Manual"" does an excellent job of getting you up to speed with Elements non-standard user interface. Barbara's emphasis on using keyboard shortcuts to be efficient is especially appreciated.I also have Scott Kelby's ""The Photoshop Elements 3 Book for Digital Photographers"" and Richard Lynch's ""The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 3"". If I could keep only one of these books, ""The Missing Manual"" would be it."
5,"Truly the ""missing manual""","This is the one book you should buy if you are a Photoshop Elements user. It truly is the ""missing manual."" Brundage has made an effort to discuss every feature of the program. She provides excellent tutorials as well as the concepts behind them. Great for the beginner, but also outstanding for the more seasoned Elements user as a reference source."
4,great starter program,"I am not a total newcomer to photo programs so a book that goes beyond basics was what I was looking for. This book fills the bill. It is well written and fairly easy to understand. The book discusses most of the capabilities of Elements 3 and has great photos as examples for the text. I had a lot of fun applying the lessons to my photos. The only 'con' I have is that I would have liked greater explanation and detail for use of some of the features, for example historigram and gradients, but as a primer to a more advanced book it can't be beat.Adefinite ""buy""."
4,A very good Manual,"This is the book that should have been included with Elements 3.0 software. It is a comprehensive guide to all the features of the Photoshop Elements 3. It will help you become a more organized, efficient. Very clear and concise manual all of the major components of the program are discussed and how and where to use them. Each feature is carefully explained in straightforward language. I highly recommend this book."
3,Okay,"This one is hard to review, but I will try.I am a Physical Therapist, and I also have lymphatic issues. I bought this book to get a better idea of technique for MLD (as this is a specialty course over and above my education).I was surprised at how much education was provided on anatomy and function of the lymphatic system. It was very well done in a manor that all can understand.However, I was a bit disappointed with the guidance on technique. He does an excellent job at providing instruction on MLD of the face. But not for the hands, feet or back. He touches on the basic areas of the body, but that is about it. His technique is right and his guidance is good. It is just a very basic video, and I was hoping for more.In summary, it is good and is worth getting and is great for beginers. If you are looking for something thorough that covers the entire body and ALL of the lymphatic flow directions, than this will not help much. I am still glad I got it. It was a good review and helped a little."
3,Good for beginners,This is a good beginning lymph drainage DVD. It tends to get a little slow and repetitive if you have any training in lymph at all. My employees use it as an introduction for very basic technique. I personally was looking for something a little more in-depth and technical.
1,warrenty,mtd only repairs saw for 70% of value so when you take it for repair cost is always more then 70% of value so they say you must exchange it from where you bought it amazon will not exchange it only take it back with in 30 days went round and round with mtd and amazon niether well do anything so 2 year warrenty means 30 days was told plasic gear in saw wears fast
3,light duty saw,"Worked ok for light duty trimming and cutting but when I used it to cut up fallen tree about 16"" diam the internal gear to drive chain broke. Since it was still under warranty I took it to authorized repair shop who told me to just retun it to seller since it would cost more to repair than cost of a new one. Had no problem returning for a replacement."
4,"Tom, Sawyer","It is the perfect tool for the infrequent sawyer, as I am. I do a few logs a year---I'm a woodturner, really, and occasionally need to ""do unto"" a log to make it suitable to turn on my lathe. This is a great tool for that. For P. Bunyan, I'd recommend something more ""Husky!"""
3,"Good, but what about hard mode?","This book helps a lot at first but when the puzzles change, it is useless. Most of the puzzles on hard mode are different and this book does not have any solutions to them."
4,Works well,I just got the game and the strategy guide today and i discovered that the guide is actually very useful. I have bought games and their guides before and have it be like they were for seperate games. I highly recomend this strategy guide
5,Fear Continues!,"Fear Effect is by far one of the best franchises that deserve a revamp. The second game top the first one in many ways. As in the first game, without the guide, your pretty much stuck. It's an Action RPG, so you need all the help you can get, the guide explain every detail, level, and hidden gems the game has to offer and that I missed the first time I played it. So grab the game and guide and enjoy it."
2,Great Title But....,"This is a moderately interesting story with sympathetic characters, and Bloom offers important historical information about the time of the Nazi occupation and aftermath as it affected a particular set of individuals. However, the unnecessary dialogue, loading of character background and atrocious punctuation ruin the overall effect."
4,Great visual images,"This book has fabulous pictures, and also a good written history of the Jews in the twentieth century. My small objection to the book is after World War II, he mostly deals with Israel, with small mention of Jews in other countries and their contributions to society. I understand why, but as the book has until then done a good job of discussing Jews throughout various countries, it's focus seems to become rather narrow. And Jews in other countries are usually mentioned only in context of immigration to or support of Israel. As the author points out, the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel does, and so it would seem a little more discussion of Jews in the U.S. and their contributions-most of the people he mentions are writers or entertainers, would be in order. But the photos do make up for any short-comings in the commentary.."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"I read a lot of horror stories, mostly at Ezines. I especially like ghost stories. I was thrilled to find this collection, thought it would be better than what I usually read. It really wasn't. Subtle horror can be good, but this one goes too far. Most of the stories I read paid too much attention to suspension of disbelief and ended up boring. I didn't read the entire book. I let off after the Grant story, so I can't comment on any after that. It may be better for someone who appreciates a highly intellectual style of horror, but I couldn't get into it."
5,How God Teaches Us,"It is such a relief to know that at least a few other human beings are tuned into to God's will for his creatures. All of his creatures, and not just the human ones. Strong biblical arguments against the human exploitation of animals."
4,A Great Starting Point,"If you're looking for a single book to answer all questions you may have on animal theology, this probably isn't it. Such a book does not exist (trust me, I've looked). However, if you're interested in a Christian perspective of animal ethics or animal mercy, J. R. Hyland gives the perfect starting point. My only other complaint is that the author uses different bible versions to back his claims, using different translations to make different arguments sound more convincing. Still, the information is valid and I recommend the book to any Christian."
4,Promises Unfulfilled,"West Wing was a great series that ran into problems as the seasons progressed. At some point there was a problem between the network and the series creator Aaron Sorkin. I don't know what the problems were but there were hints of philosophical differences. Program quality declined as a result.Year four was an opportunity for newly reelected President Bartlett to push a progressive agenda and thereby educate the American public about possibilities that might have helped us avoid the grand larceny that resulted from the right wing program of class warfare, deregulation, privatization and union busting.Instead, most likely as a result of network ""guidance/interference"" the series lost direction at this point and meandered to a most uninspiring ending."
3,the good and the bad...,"First the good: great program, and Season Four continues the good acting from this cast, as well as Aaron Sorkin's superb writing, mixing informative dialogue with amusing banter, that keeps one caring about this ensemble, and makes this whole series one to return to again and again.The bad: the boxed set was sent without the booklet listing the episode titles and descriptions, so it is hard to find the episodes ones wants to watch. Returning for exhange didn't help, as ALL the stock in a major outlet was also missing the booklet, so I tried to track down the booklet separately, from the online seller, as well as from Warner Home Video directly - still waiting, after 2 months. I'd advise potential buyers to wait until this is sorted out, and ask specifically if the booklet is included, before purchasing."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this product. It said it was ""new"", but it did not look ""new"". It came wrapped in wrapping paper, therefore, the edges of the box were frayed. The DVD's were in backwards and not wrapped. There were some slight scuff marks on one of the DVD's. This is the first time I would have to say I was not very happy with a purchase made through Amazon. I would not buy from this Company, ""Comedyan"" again."
5,Great DVD Series,I purchased this item as a gift for my father for the holidays. He has enjoyed watching the season and having his DVD series complete.
4,Another Great Season,"The start of the season is a bit slow, but it's another season of great writing and acting. The season finale is awesome and I'll buy the 5th season right away!"
4,An Excellent Season,"This season of the West Wing was just marvelous...if the ending was a bit overdramatic.Sorkin's work was losing a little steam towards the end, it's true. But the notion of a kidnaping and appropriate required response for a chief executive is not as outlandish as it seems at first blush.Some said the series pretty much ended with this season. I disagree; there are some great episodes ahead in seasons five and six.What a shame that it has been canceled!"
5,Great rerun.,The West Wing is still the best show ever put on TV. And all the seasons are worth watching.
5,Restoring America's Spirit,"West Wing was the best thing produced by network television since M*A*S*H. It had humor, depth, brilliance, magnificent writing, and a gifted cast. It restored my faith in America--something I feared was impossible in the present climate. I had the first three seasons on video, but felt the last two were not quite so good. Watching the re-runs, however, I caught the last of the fourth season, the kidnapping of the President's daughter, which I had not seen completely before, but missed the first episode of the fifth season, about her rescue, which I had never seen. So, of course, I had to order the fourth and fifth seasons to satisfy my curiosity and complete my set."
1,Mostly scratched.,"Cds were mostly scratched. Could not watch an entire episode without interruption or having to forward to a different chapter. The rating at amazon when I made this purchase was ""acceptable"". However, the cds I received were NOT acceptable as watching them has been a real drag. Would not purchase from this vendor again."
1,Don't buy just yet! - defective 6th disk.,"The 6th disk, which is supposed to have the special features, only lists the audio commentary for the last two episodes, and none of the other 3 featurettes (sp?). I put in a call to ShopNBC.com and they pulled the item from their website the same day. (although as of today the 4 season disk set is still for sale, which presumably includes the defective 6th disk from season 4.) I'm waiting to see when they re-release them, or offer a replacement 6th disk. The set is great other than that. (I bought mine at a brick and mortar April 5th) Keep an eye out for a release date on season 5 too!Joelb"
2,West Wing has fallen and can't get up,"No use repeating what's already been said by others. This season was when West Wing turned into one ridiculous parade of grinding ""big dramas"". Here's where it started turning into a dreary soap opera, where DC becomes ""Dallas"". In previous seasons the show could stand on its own merits, on the fascination of the political process, on the characters, but this season descended into muck as someone must have decided that every show had to be more whiz-bang than its predecessor. You almost expect Bruce Willis to show up.The addition of the bookish Josh Molina doesn't compensate for the loss of Rob Lowe's character. Add to that the amazing mortality rate of so many interesting characters who appeared for awhile during the first few seasons, then vanished into thin air and it seems that something was just slowly going wrong.Somewhere in the middle of this season this show outlived its usefulness. Maybe if we simply stop feeding it, it will go away."
5,A Tour-de-Force Season!,"Season 4 and the premire of Season 5 mark the final shows of Rob Lowe, Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme on West Wing. Season 4 was an emotionally trying season, but Sorkin's talent for intragrating comedy into those powerful and emotional moments has yet to be matched by the current incarnation of writers on the show. I must admit that the show has improved since Season 5. Season 5 was a bad year for the new writers, they kept trying to imitate Sorkin's style without the talent for it. To make up for their lack of creative dialogue, they ""jumped the shark"" plot-wise SEVERAL times. Now in season 6, with a new election on the way, these new writers have found their own voice for our favourite characters. Though the dialouge of the current season doesn't have Sorkin's rhythm or edge, it's still worth watching.Season 4 is brilliant. A must-own for all die-hard fans, a must-see for all those who have not had the chance before."
1,Boring,"The most boring show on earth. The characters are completely out of place, unhumourous, and annoying. I would never but to own it."
1,Hate Luv-Cart,"The Luv-Cart is without a doubt the most useless piece of equipment I ever purchased. Aside from assembly which is not difficult once you are able to spring the two halfs together, the thing simply will not operate on grass without pushing it with great force and much slower than a wheelbarrow and don't even think about going up a very slight grade - empty! If you are tempted to buy this under-powered piece of junk - run away - fast!"
5,I wouldn't have thought....,"I got this cart for my birthday from my wife and kids. I'm 55 and do lots of yard work, and I consider myself an active person. When I got it, I laughed and thought...""here's one gift that's going to sit in the shed"". It took about 20 minutes to put together and I started using that very day. I was just amazed at how the cart made my work so much easier. Over the last month I have moved stones, rocks, mulch, and dirt. I even used it to hall out trash from the shed to make room for my cart since I wanted to have easy access to it. It can stay tilted up on its own which makes it easy to store and dump things out. I get an entire weekend out of one charge and it doesn't even slow down. My cart has two speeds forward and one reverse, which I thought was a nice feature.Who would have thought that I would be using this, but it really works well."
1,"Underpowered for hauling gravel, sand or dirt.","I purchased the LUVCart hoping that it would be a great tool for doing small jobs around the house such as moving pea gravel, dirt, and moving items back and forth from the house to my vehicle. However the LUVCart failed almost immediately after being purchased. The LUVCart is a great idea, and the plastic tub that holds material seems to be fairly well constructed. The weak point seems to be the motor and circuitry. The LUVCart only operated for me for less than an hour before it stopped working and would not restart. Even while it was in operation it strained under the very small load of pea gravel in its bucket, and the bucket was not even half full. The 5 cubic foot of material that the LUVCart is capable of handling is a wild exaggeration unless you only want to haul 5 cubic feet of grass clippings or dry leaves."
1,Stay away,"I bought a cart form Amazon in May 2005. It was relatively eazy to assemble, but proved to be completely useless. Reverse function did not work at all, it would not move on a grassy surface and even a slight slope was impossible to overcome without heavy pushing! (So much for Motorized Vehicle).I would like to credit Amazon for allowing me to return this garbage free of charge."

2,Dull,"I agree 100% with ""a music fan from Chicago."" This CD is flat and lifeless. As someone who has all of Laura Love's other CD's (and who is completely in ""love"" with her music), this CD is a real disappointment. Laura Love is one of the most exciting, talented, and individual performers to come around in years. If you haven't heard her yet, you're really missing out. Buy one of her CD's, but I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,bland covers of her old material with some bland new songs,"I love Laura Love's previous albums. That is why this ok album was such a huge disappointment to me. I bought it on faith, but I should have looked more closely at the songs -- I might have noticed how many of them I already have! Even so, a ""best of Laura Love"" CD would be good to have. Sadly, all of her funk and liveliness have been produced out of this album. One of the things I love about Laura Love is that she always sounds like she loves to sing and like she is having a great time recording the songs. This album sounds flat, like she was bored. Oh well, off to the used CD store to get my $4..."
5,Shum Ticky by Laura Love,"I love all of Laura's music, but this CD has a special place in my heart & soul. I had the good fortune to see her live when this album was first out. While the music on the album is excellent, her live performance was life-changing. I truly unique & engaging artist. Her band ROCKS as well! Super tight & loose at the same time! You can't help but move."
5,See Laura live,"We saw Laura Love play last night (5/11/01) at La Salles in Chico, CA. She really is an amazing talent. She stretched her voice out, hitting a greater range than on any of her recordings, and still right on pitch. Her bass playing was likewise amazing. The rest of the band was equally enjoyable. Highly recommended!"
4,From top to bottom,"How can I forget my first HTML book? It is truly an excellent book, during vacations I spent everyday reading it and I finished within weeks (although it is very thick!)The book is very well organized and covers every aspect of HTML programming. However, *WARNING!* there are many sections of this book that covers the artistic aspects of web-design. This may be good or bad. Bad for someone who has experience in web-design and knows that your background and font color should not be almost the same. Good for someone who is starting because they are very useful tips that otherwise you might neglect. However, learn HTML fast, well do not use this book (or you will have to skip a lot of sections.) use another book that is more straightforward."
2,Unfulfilled promise,"The mixing on some tracks is awful, and at one point, vocals are lost altogether on The Rascals track. I love this music -- the soundtrack of my college days -- so having it on one disc for traveling (I commute 50 miles round trip every day) is great, but the quality could be lots better."
5,Memories,The quality of this product is awesome. Listining to the soundtrack brought back such great memories of these songs. I was able to relax and remember the times and the movie. And the ease of finding this through the Amazon web site was so easy and could not ask for a better price.
5,The Best of the Best,"These are the songs you listened to as a kid, those that you hear on the radio and sing along to. These are the songs that everybody knows. Songs like joy to the world and I heard it through the grapevine. I would reccomend this CD to anyone; it is the compilation of the best of the best, and the only song missing is ""Forever Young,"" by Rod Stewart."
3,The Big Chill cd,"good cd although missing ""Heard it Through the Grapevine"". Arrived on timed and well packaged."
3,Tell Him by the Exciters,"""The Big Chill"" is a nice soundtrack CD, but I bought it for one tune: Tell Him by the Exciters. You just can't get that tune anywhere else."
4,digital formal,"Although I own a tape of this music, I wanted a digital format. The result is identical to the version I own."
5,The Big Chill CD,"Awesome music....loved the movie and this is a flash back to the past.Great tunes to dance to, cuddle to, etc."
2,Never received the CD!,"Although the CD is terrific (I'm replacing an existing one that got lost), it never arrived. I had to write in three times before I finally was awarded a refund."
3,Maybe the Stones wouldn't cough up the rights.,"Could be my memory's faulty. Could be the Stones wouldn't give the rights to the label. But don't I remember the movie starting out rolling a coffin down the aisle to the wistful cynicism of Jagger's scratchy tenor complaint, ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"". To prove the literal truth of the lyrics, the song isn't in either soundtrack.What else are we missing?!"
4,A great collection of songs,"This soundtrack is one of the best I have heard, where every song is a joy. If you are a fan of oldies or just enjoy being able to listen to a CD all the way through without having to skip any bad tracks, then buy this CD!"
4,Now I Know What My Parents Were Talking About,"When I was in elementary school, I can remember this soundtrack playing in my house.....alot. At the time I didn't get what was so great about these songs. Now I am out of college, and I recently purchased this c.d. because of nostalgic childhood memories. I finally understand why my parents loved this album. The songs capture a certain time and mood, and as listeners, we are automatically taken there. All the songs are wonderful, especially ""Whiter Shade of Pale"". This is a wonderful collection of songs, that are sure to delight listeners young and old."
1,Horrible,"I ordered toner for my printer and was sent the wrong size, i contacted the company they told me to return the wrong ones in exchange for the right size. Its been over a week and still nothing back. I emailed them and no response. I will never order from this company again."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"After reading the nice reviews, I purchased two of these stir fry pans.I've used mine only 5 times, each time with wooden utensils and the nonstick coasting is flaking off in several spots!The second one that I purchased was a gift to my mother. Her stir fry pan is also loosing it's non stick coating after just 3 uses. Both pans were hand washed using a soft sponge; wooden utensils.This pan is a waste of your money. I ended up throwing it away!! I've already wasted money on this purchase; why throw more money away sending it back!!"
4,easy no-hands toilet clean-up,"Toilet cleaning is not my favorite job. I do not like the brushes that sit in damp containers after the cleanup. This particular gadget is very effective for cleaning the toilet effortlessly - it can reach everywhere, under the rim etc. Best of all, at the end you can place the wand in your wastebasket and release the disposable cleaning head (a foam rubber disk impregnated with cleaner). It is important to read the instructions before use - some others have had trouble because they hit the release button while the wand was in the toilet and then had to fish the disk out. In the box you also get a rather flimsy plastic holder for the wand, which I have attached to the side of the tank, so that the wand is always there. I keep the clean disks in a cabinet. The only negative that I can see is the fact that it quite a bit more expensive to use than the traditional icky brush and a liquid toilet cleaner."
4,Non messy toilet cleaning!,"Well this is one job that is icky. But with clorox wands, its a breeze cleaning the toilet bowl now. And the storage is cute."
4,good character development,"after reading his first book (and enjoying the preposerous story line), i looked forward to his second effort. this book haas some basis in possibility that #1 lacked. The author develops characters rather well in this effort. the sophomore jinx didn't grab the writer.overall, it was prety enjoyable even from a practicing lawyer's point of view. highly recommended as a clever piece of fiction."
5,I read it in one night,"Riveting, honest, and a true law THRILLER. As good as DEAD EVEN, but more mature. I look forward to the long carreer of Mr. Meltzer."
1,Ugly main characters,"The book opens up with the two main characters (Sara, Jared) and their local grocery store owner friend (Mickey) trash this old lady who comes into the store with a store coupon for Cheerios only to find there are no Cheerios on the shelf. She camplains to Mickey about it and instead of simply saying he was sorry and giving her a 'rain check' he and Sara and Jared light into her like rabid dogs. I mean it was disgusting. I know quite a few grocery store owners (big cities and small) and none would dare to speak to customer that way or let his friends do so. Sara and Jared are rude offensive arseholes. I took the book back to the library next day. No thank you."
3,"Interesting premise, good story","What if you're the defense attorney for a scumbag who threatens to kill your wife if you don't get him off. And what if your wife is the prosecuting attorney and she's been threatened that you will be killed if you do get him off. And you can't tell each other. Very interesting, complicated reading. I liked it."
2,A waste of time.,"I listened to the unabridged audio cd version of this story. What a mess. I'm giving up 2/3rds of the way through because I just don't care anymore how these idiot characters end up. I am most appalled by writers who write of supposedly intelligent characters - in this case, two married lawyers - who do unbelievably stupid things without sensible, logical motivation. The two main characters are completely pitiful. They repeat their own self-doubt endlessly. and I mean ENDLESSLY. So much so that I finally stopped caring what happened to these two. The story is confusing and illogical from beginning to end. Why neither one would report the outrageously criminal activity that was needed to move the story along makes positively no sense. Do not waste your time on this one."
1,CHEESE!,"This book has the most inane dialogue I have ever run across, and the plot was so Hollywood formulaic and stupid!Maybe Meltzer should write screenplays."
3,Fair,"You can do worse for a train ride book. Pacing is good, but the dialogue between characters is simply awful. Male characters go from one extreme to other, ""Whiner"" or ""Menace"", so it's hard to relate to them."
2,One of the worst books I've read in a long time,"Why did I even finish this book? After the first chapter, I was frustrated by the stilted dialogue, the whiny main character, and the improbable coincidences that set up the plot. I kept reading to see if it would get better, but it just kept getting worse and worse."
3,Dead Even,First Brad Meltzer book I read & it was very boring. Plot was superficial & seemed to take a while to unfold. Expected more depth to characters. Have checked out 7 more of his books from the library; hopefully they are much better.
3,It grabs you from the very first page. But...,"Very interesting plot. Unfortunately the last pages don't have the same force as the rest of the book. For the last two chapters of the book, when Meltzer gets away from the courtroom and legal thriller the plot loses its strength and starts to fall at some common fights and shootings."
1,This is a horrible book,"Plain and simple, this book stinks. One of the stupidest plots one can imagine written by someone who must know absolutely nothing about the legal field. You just can't read this book without putting it down in disdain!"
2,Not worth it,"While I enjoyed ""The Tenth Justice"", I found this latest novel by Brad Meltzer boring and unconvincing. Meltzer takes the easy way out on several occasions - for example, instead of detailing Sara's closing arguments to the Grand Jury, Meltzer justs states that she was brillant. How she got the indictment is beyond me. Also, how was Conrad involved in the scheme, and why wasn't that explained? I won't be passing this one on to any of my friends."
1,"Predictable, Unimaginative, and Disappointing",Don't waste your time.The Tenth Justice began Meltzer's career with a bang. Dead Even had reduced it to a fizzle.Dead Even was poorly written and probably not even a viable situation. The characters were one-dimensional. How could this even happen???
2,Don't bother,"The snappy dialogue was still there, but it didn't seem to move the story along at all. The ""bad guys"" were caricatures of good villains. It's such a shame he bothered publishing this."
2,Not the quality of The Tenth Justice,"After reading The Tenth Justice, I was eager to buy and read this book. It was a let down. Meltzer never finished developing the female character, although the husband came off very well. I noticed a bit of the same in The Tenth Justice, but thought perhaps it worked with the story. This story, however, just never seemed to form. It just wandered....."
4,A fast page turner,"If you like a thiller this is one to read, it was a fast read and most enjoyable.There were a few disappointments but not enough to ruin it as a good book! I look forward to more of his books!"
2,Doesn't get going until mid-way through.,"Sara Tate is a Manhattan assistant DA. Due to budget cuts she will lose her job unless she wins a big case. She nabs what looks to be an easy burglary case. It turns out to be much, much more.Jared is her husband. He is black mailed into going head-to-head on the case against his wife. He either wins the case or his wife gets killed. Sara is on a black mailer list too. She either wins the case or her husband gets killed.***It does not really get going until half way through. Then it gets many twists and turns. Full of legal situations and you will learn a lot about how ADA's work, but for someone not in the profession, this book will not be very gripping.***"
4,Hard to put down - page turner!,"I have now read the Tenth Justice and Dead Even. I really enjoyed Dead Even as much as the Tenth Justice. I rarely get into books lately due to lack of time, and I've got to say everyone should read these books! I get so caught up in the stories that I don't want to stop reading until I can barely stay awake! You need to pick up a copy of Dead Even soon!!"
4,if you liked the tenth justice...,"i can't say that dead even is the best work of literature ever written, but you really can't deny that it is extremely entertaining. if you like john grisham, or if you read the tenth justice and liked it, then you will more than likely like this book. i finished it in one day because i didn't want to put it down!"
2,Tried too hard,"I enjoyed Meltzer's first novel about the Supreme Court so I was looking forward to his second effort. What a letdown. He tries to be too evenhanded with his main characters, married lawyers on opposite sides in a messy case. He won't allow us to dislaike either character. The villains are cruel but the reader cannot relate as the mystery is built around not who but why, so we learn along with the legal halfwits. Meltzer should considerletting the reader in on the motive so that they can enjoy the ride. Meltzer, please try again."
3,Starts with a bang and ends with a fizzle,"One of the things I like about Meltzer is that his characters are real. They screw uo just like everyone else. Unfirtunately, it is too easy to guess the villians here. If you liked Tenth Justice, DO NOT read this. It will just ruin your impression on the author. Originally, I couldn't wait for his next book. Now, I hope he takes the time to write a better plot. Oh well, Grisham had bad books too (in fact, many)."
3,Meltzer is improving-- but not much,"Meltzer is an interesting author. His prose is interesting and well done. However, he has several significant limitations:1. His plots are too predictable.2. His characters remind me of cartoon characters. Too flat. They always whine. Too much self doubt.3. His lawyers are always the dumbest lawyers in literature with the hero or heroine role. Don't they teach ethics in law school anymore. His hero always seem to have failed ethics. Once they cross the ethical line they never seem smart enough to know how to correct the situation. I wish the author wrote about lawyers that knew the law.This is a good book to read in the waiting room. It is mildly entertaining but I never objected if I was interrupted while reading."
2,Terrible,"Ugh, bleech, gah!Yeah, it was bad. Too Long. Too Convoluted and just plain bad. The last 100 pages seemed to have been just thrown together to get to the ending. Instead of trying to tie things up nicely, leave some things hanging. This is the second book of Brad Meltzer's I've read, 10th Justice being the first, and I feel this one took a step back. What is his deal with trying to throw a twist in by the main characters? Hey, lets prove we are smarter than all the supporting characters and make a really convoluted, trite last 100 pages!!!Sorry it just does not work.Read if you must, but it's not recommended."
4,Exciting read,"This is the second book by Meltzer that I truly enjoyed. The pace starts off slow and builds to a dramatic climax where I found myself racing to the end. I read this in two sittings. It's a book you won't want to put down.The only thing that keeps this book from perfect is the same malady that plagues most thrillers and that is all the anti-climatic mish mash that detracts from the story being told.Meltzer does a decent job of developing the main characters; however, he could have added a bit more on some of the secondary characters as we hardly get to know Conrad and Guff (just enough to want to know more). It was easy to picture Sara and JaredI look forward to reading his next book, First Counsel. If you love fast paced legal thrillers (with less emphasis on the law and more on action) then you will love this book."
1,"My gut instinct said ""don't buy this!"" unfortunately, I did","I enjoyed most of the tenth justice, so I was pretty excited to read this. I hesitated after reading the flap copy because the concept really irritated me--beyond farfetched and seemingly designed with a movie in mind, but I gave in on a rainy Saturday. This book is crap. It reminds me of another disappointing second book, Reaper by Ben Mezrich. Both books are very shallow, and read like summarized movie scenes--or sound bytes, all flash and no substance. The absolute low point came near the end, with the ridiculous grand finale which never could have happened. I think Brad should read a few more good books--he makes Grisham seem like Hemingway or Fitzgerald in comparison with this poor effort. I too, am suspect of many of these 5 star reviews. Curious how they read rather like back of the book raves, isn't it? Save your money, rent the movie when it goes to the video stores!"
1,Sophmorish drivel,"I enjoyed The Tenth Justice. Even though I felt the premise of Dead Even was outlandish, I decided to read it. Bad choice. What a sorry bunch of jerk it this way, jerk it that way. None of it is plausible and it doesn't hang together."
1,iNTERESTING PREMISE--POORLY EXECUTED,"The characters were totally unbelievable and rather unlikable. In the right hands the plot could've been clever. These were not the right hands. The lack of tension was remarkable. One didn't care about Sara or Jared's fates. For Sarah to start an office flirtation at that point in the narration was simply not plausible. Death threats aimed at her loved ones, new job, career in jeopardy, multiple murders, and Sara has time to be attracted to a co-worker! Talk about straining credulity... Grisham needn't lose any sleep!"
2,SLOW SLOW AND WAS MORE LIKE WAR OF THE ROSES,"THIS AUTHOR NEEDS TO STICK TO THE PRACTICE OF LAW......HE SEEMS TO TAKE PERSONAL SITUATIONS,,,, FAR TO AN EXTREME........EITHER A ROMANCE, OR THRILLER.....I SAY NOT EITHER."
1,A lousy read!,"Almost impossible to believe the same author wrote THE TENTH JUSTICE! Acts 1 and 2 were readable, but Act 3 is a disaster. Whoever was the author's Editor should read Philip Margolin's, William Bernhardt's, Steve Martini's and Robert Tanenbaum's novels and William Diehl's PRIMAL FEAR and learn how to craft legal thrillers. This novel now heads my list of the most disappointing novels I have read this year!"
2,"Predictable, disappointing",Talk about trite dialogue. Please give us some mystery. This book fell way beyond my expectations!
2,Smarmy,"After reading the wide range of reviews - 10s and 1s - I decided to read the first chapter online. So my review isn't reflective of the entire novel. Nevertheless, the first chapter was so smarmy that I don't have any desire to continue. The author is too ""cute"" with the dialog; it makes you dislike the characters right off the bat.Too bad - the reviews sounded so promising."
2,Dead Even,"I read Dead Even in a couple days, and while it provides an interesting read, it could have definately been better. It has great dialogue, but the story line is pretty unrealistic. It's no Grisham novel, but I don't think that's what Meltzer was going for. The plot twists definately held you on and made you read the whole thing, however the ending is very shoddy. The book could also do without most of the swearing in the dialouge. The characters were well developed, and pick this book up for a quick read but don't expect the best."
4,A real page turner!!,"I admit the story line was a bit unrealistic, but it's a fiction novel. I could not put this book down. Every chapter ended with some cliff hanger that made me want to read more. If you're looking for something entertaining but not too realistic, this is the book."
1,I don't have to read this book to tell you not to buy!,"I never read this book and I never will, because I have already been victumised by TENTH JUSTICE. I bet my bottom dollar that he could do no better this time. I am sorry that it is guilty never proven innocent, but just for writing TENTH JUSTICE he should be handed a sentence of never ever allowed to write again!"
2,"so bad, it hurts.","Sara Tate, an assistant district attorney, has gotten an ordinary buglary case on her first day on the job. The case changes to murder and she realizes it is anything but ordinary.Jared, her busband, gets a client who will bolster his chances of becoming a partner in a law firm. The catch: he will square off against his wife, and anything less than acquittal results in death for the one he loves.Will they be able to surmount the difficulties at home? And what will be the price of their rivalry, because no matter who wins he loses.Brad Meltzer gets high marks for content; a couple slugging out it out in the courtroom is indeed fertile land in the malnourished plains of legal fiction.Still Dead Even is no immacaulate conception. The dialogue is puerile, the plot asinine, the ending insignificant. No one stands up to the thugs as they go around harassing Jared and Sara.The novel resembles a house painter's effort on canvas."
2,Light-weight airport reading,"If I'd recognized the name of the author of The Tenth Justice, I might not have bought Dead Even. In this book, Meltzer recycles the characters from his first book - we have the same snappy (or is that ""sappy?"") dialogue between the same cardboard characters. Sara Tate is supposed to be a hard-driving attorney, yet she is also a mass of self-doubt and vulnerability who so doubts her ability to get a job that she has to cling to her position as an ADA, even when her husband's life is threatened. The same can be said of that husband, Jared (where does he get these names?), who, we are asked to believe, deeply loves his wife, but wouldn't dream of quitting his job, even though doing that job is putting his wife's life in danger. This is the sort of book that you might try when you're stuck in an airport and you're desparate for reading material."
2,convoluted,"Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Bad Meltzer fan and have loved all of his other books. This one one how ever was DOA. From the start his characters (usually his strong suite) were uninteresting and cardboardish. The plot was totally convoluted and downright silly!! My advice would be to skip this book entirely and read ALL of his other books. This one is about equal to a Paterson book, which isn't saying much."
1,Another Over-Hyped Piece Of Tripe.,"I could not agree more with the reader in NYC who believes the glowing reviews for this book are plants from the publisher. All that glib crap about a great beach read and roller-coaster ride could not be more off the mark. I can't believe I even bothered to read it: it is as implausible, phoney, dumb and boring as his first effort. How does this guy keep getting published? Surely Generation X has more savvy, intellect and taste than this. If you want a legal thriller, try ""Chain of Custody"" by Harry Levy. The ending isn't as strong as the beginning, but it is worlds better than this crap. And shame on Amazon.com for featuring it on their opening screen! You can do better than this."
1,Stop the bullet train I want to get off,"Why bother spending your hard earned money on this brain-dead ""bullet-train"" fiction? Why not just set fire to the $25.00 in your wallet? The flames would be prettier than the prose, the feeling afterwards would last longer than the story, and it would be over a lot faster. Hackneyed, lackluster, sold-it-to-the- movie-producers-before-I-typed-a-word Brad Meltzer is in it for the dough. And his work gives me more reason to HATE all lawyers-turned-writers. Slimy, contrived, and bogus to the core, ""Dead Even"" should be dead last."
2,evenly dead,"over 500 pages of piffle. plot driven formula fiction. suspense is manufactured with devices that are contrived, implausible and mechanical.a sophomore jinx for the author."
3,Comedy show...maybe,The plot is so convoluted that it may make a game together with Jared killed Elliot with the candlestick in the library. It is disappointing that two charactewrs can be sooo DUMB. This is the first of his books that I found to be waste of time.
5,SLOW START BUT THEN WATCH OUT!!!!,"WOW!!!! what a great second book....literary rollercoaster after slow start!!!!! loved the characters....yeah, this is fiction so you can kill off a couple of characters here and there...but what's literary license for if you don't use it...eh? brad meltzer writes easy-to-read stuff...fun to learn the behind the scenes in the d.a.'s office and another winner destined to top the charts fast!!!! thanx, brad, have you quit your day job yet????? gotta keep churning them out fast!!!!"
4,Too many coincidences,"A very well written book. A fast-placed plot, but too many coincidences happen after one another, that make you lose track of the plot. But besides that, I could not wait to get till the end of the book."
1,Still die trying to finish the pages and chapters,"""The Tenth Justice"" and now, ""Dead Even"", I've tried very hard to read along and finish these two pathetically written, but definitely successfually marketed books to make my stupidly wasted money worth! I swear that I am still die trying so far, cuz I have an unsalvageable ""once bought, got to finish it"" habit. But after tried so hard and so long with this guy's two books, I'm really wondering if I could use this opportunity to kill and replace it with basic but never wrong ""Once Bitten Twice Shy"" lesson. During my next trying, I would bring these two books to a park on a windy day, and let the wind decide which page or chapter should I read."
4,Pretty good book,"I like this book. Mr. Owen takes the reader with him from the US Marine Bases to the battlefields of Korea. I like the way he explains situations and identifies and describes the other personnel with him. He takes you into the trenches, through the rice paddies and up the hillsides. He really tells it like it was which is different from other books I have read about the Koren War. Personal and enjoyable."
4,Korean War-Marines,"This is an excellent book of the Forgotten War. The story is straight forward and personal. Since I knew a Marine who fought at the Chosin Reservoir, this story brings the incredible fight to life. I admire the bravery of the men. Highly recommend this one."
1,Fast speech,Whoever is the reader has a very fast speech pattern that makes it near impossible for me to understand. This is the worst audio book I ever had! I can't even comment on the story and I was there!
5,Cheryl Harness Rocks!,Another rich and detailed work by Cheryl Harness. You cannot go wrong with her books; each one is a masterpiece!
5,Not My Reality,I loved this book and really felt I could relate to the characters in the book. The book held my attention through out.Can't wait to find out what happens to Sam in the next book. Great book for a young teen.
3,Baseball Stars of the 1950's and 1960's,I bought this book because it is about the heroes of my youth. I found the book to be an easy read with a quick rehash of their careers. I didn't find any real depth to any of the summaries of the players interviewed. I believe the book to be more suitable for a pre-teen or teen-aged reader who would be interested in an introduction to the players who made up baseball's golden age.
4,A good Acid Jazz/Hip Hop fusion.,I first heard Sound Assembly on a few of the early Acid Jazz collection CDs back in the early 1990s. The liner notes always said that the single on the collection was from a forthcoming full album by Sound Assembly.While the album may not stand up to modern day hip hop or acid jazz... it presents a nice time-capsule to what I felt was cutting edge at the time.
2,Where's The Inspiration?,"Nina has quite an effective way of getting under your skin and annoying you till you shut her up. Most songs sound overly uninspired while she sings as if she's making up the words at that very moment, like improv. There are no melodies to most of the songs on here and the music doesn't stick, even if you have listened to the songs 3 times or more. It's almost like modern jazz.Stand out tracks are A Dog's Life, Stormy Weather (an instant classic), Too Much In Between, The Long Walk, All Your Life and 4 Yrs.The rest is all filler, not even good enough for background music."
4,Great for new Mac User like me,"For new mac user like me, this book really helps me on learning the mac in a quick way. Lots of informations in this book might be written well and in detail in larger reference book, but the way Scott Kelby wrote it, very simple without all the overinformation regarding simple actions. As he intentionally put it: This book is full of sidebar tips, and nothing else but sidebars materials.For more advance tricks, ie. changing iPhoto library to external drive, is not addressed in this book.I highly recommend this book, especially for new users like me. I can't comment yet for experienced mac user."
2,Not for a computer dummy!!,"Way over my head for me. I thought it would be for a true novice. I read one page and closed it up. I need a lot more experience to even understand what he is saying. I do believe it will be a good teaching tool after I truly find out all that I don't know. I didn't begin to understand the terminology being used. I intend to keep the book and maybe in a few more months, look it up again to see if it is beginning to make a little more sense to me!!"
5,S.Kelby does it again! Wonderfull !!,"You can immediately see that this very fine edition is a product of true love,from a writer whose writings the last few years do nothing else but illuminating us all on how to make the best out of our MACS."
2,Make your own!,"Why spend $10 for a nylon sock for your roof? I made my own, using a package of knee-high nylons from the dollar store, de-icer and a few lengths of rope (neither of which are included with this product anyway). My home-made versions work just as well, the nylons survived the entire winter intact (a pleasant surprise!) and the package of six nylon knee-high's only cost me a dollar! Save your money.....make your own!"
4,"It works,,,,but","OK, this is a much more durable product than the panty hose that folks have mentioned. Filled with calcium chloride , the sock melted ice,and did create a channel for water to drain which was good. The problem is, that the calcium chloride in the sock completely melts overnight and the sock is now frozen to the roof and can't be removed. If you put another sock on top if it, all is melted andbyouncan remove sock one.If you have an occasional ice dam problem , and you can easily reach the area to place the sock, this sock with calcium chloride will do the job. If you are in a climate more severe than mine, seek a permanent solution with heated eave panels, for which you will need a roofer, and electrician ."
4,Ice Socks Worked Well on Ice Dam,"I purchased the ice socks to help melt the large amount of ice that had formed in my gutters. After placing the filled ice socks directly on the ice, the ice began to melt. The process takes a few days to work but it eventually did the job (does not happen overnight). I was pleased with my purchase of the ice socks. I will have them on hand for next winter."
3,"It works OK, but was too hard to place","It definitely got things melting. The problem was getting it up on the roof. Once filled with ice melt, the thing is way too heavy to sling up above the second floor to the roof. I was afraid the cure was going to be worse than the disease as I almost gave myself a heart attack with the exertion of trying to throw 15 lbs. up that high. Once I made it, there was only a 50-50 shot it would (a) be in the right spot; and (b) not slide off. Bringing out a ladder was out of the question as of course we had 4 feet of snow all around.I would say if you have a way to get access to the roof from a window, or if you live in a Cape where the roofline is lower, this product is pretty good. It definitely works as advertised once it's in position. But I have switched over to the old-fashioned method of getting outside with a snow rake after each storm and just making sure the ice dam doesn't develop in the first place."
3,Big sock,"Good in theory - big sock, plenty of room inside for icemelt. Fine for steps. Practical problem in placing filled sock on 20 ft high roof edge/gutters: too heavy to lift on a pole, too heavy to throw up, and not feasible to get rope over rooftop to haul it up. Could use ladder, but risky when thick ice on gutter and roof edge."
1,This book is NOT for a budget travelor!,"If you've got lots of cash to spend and want a fancy vacation, this book has lots for you to do. If you want to spend less then 50$ per day, this book has nothing for you.... I recommend any book from the ""Lets go"" series."
3,BE READY TO BUY NEW WHEELS.,"This is a pretty nice pair of skates for the price and the boot is great. However, when I received my skates the wheels were so warped that I couldn't even skate on them! It felt like I was skating on cobblestones. I had to buy new wheels ($50!!! Almost the price I paid for the skates!!!) in order to be able to skate on them. Some people have said that I should have just returned the whole package, but I had already waited two whole weeks to get the darn skates in the first place, and I was tired of rolling around the rink on stinky rentals. I wouldn't recommend buying this item from Amazon...not unless you want a pair of crappy wheels in the deal."
5,Great skates for the price!,"After struggling with the skates I rented at the rink, I decided I would order a pair. Until then, I hadn't realized how expensive roller skates are, so was delighted to find these. They are smooth rolling, work well in turns and help me enjoy skating again. A great bargain!"
3,"OK, but not great","I bought these skates to save some cash at the rink. The wheels are a little slow (not speed skates) but they work OK. I can still do a decent speed and just need to break them in. Not the best, but not the worst either. The strange thing is that the wheels don't match the stopper or the boot. Overall I would say they work but nothing to write home about..."
3,Okay for rolling around,"I am a figure skater and thought I could just buy an inexpensive roller skates, so I could just use to roll around the neighborhood for fun. My figure skates were very expensive and made with leather. These boots are made with all man made materials. The flap is really cheaply made so they slide around. The wheels and the base looks very sturdy. I tried once on an asphalt and it was really fun. But I wish I spent a little bit more and get the tennis shoe type for speed. You would need a thick socks so your ankles don't get bruised, there is not much pad around. And order a whole size smaller than what you wear. I wear a 6.5 sandals and 7 shoes. So I ordered a 6, but is still big. I put an insole and I wear a thick socks and it was still big. I recommend this to beginners only. But it is a good purchase overall."
5,Great fit,"A family member recommened these for me to get back into skating, they fit nicely,easy to adjust, I would recommend them to beginners also."
3,Big,"These arrived in good condition, but they were too big, probably by a size. They could probably benefit from better bearings too....but I didn't skate in them. Yes, I could have worn 5 pairs of socks and stuffed the toe with news paper, but ultimately I wanted a full leather boot and I don't own many socks. So back they went."
2,Bad Bad Bad,These skates were terrible....the wheels well 5 of them were OVAL felt like i was skating on Cobble Stones......and the tracks came loose almost fell...And yes I did check them everytime I got off the rink floor.Thankfully someone was around when the trucks came loose to help me off the floor..........spend the extra money for a better product
2,Eh,"Ordered these so I wouldn't have to rent skates at the skating rink. First time I skated I couldn't figure out why they felt ""bumpy"" when I skated. The wheels were uneven. I ordered new wheels but they still didn't feel right. They are now in a box under my bed."
5,Turkey's Pre-Eminent Popular Singer,"Revisited Turkey awhile back, after a number of years away from one of my favorite countries. And browsing the record shops, as is my wont, I found that Ibrahim Tatlises was among the most-recommended artists. I listened, bought a few of his cds and was recently hungry for more. So acquired this, and am happy to have it!Why Tatlises doesn't have an international reputation I can't imagine. His ringing tenor and propulsive phrasing are an unadulterated delight and, like all great singers, his rhythmic sense is unerring. I suspect that if you're reading this, you're Turkish and don't need me to tell you how good he is, but if you just happened by and wonder who this guy is who made so many recordings, please allow me to enthusiastically recommend this or another of them. (Iranian expat Googoosh is another superb artist I discovered on my travels. Can I persuade you to get one of hers when you get one of his.)"
2,too old and yellow,"book in much worse condition than described - so old and yellow that it's almost unreadable - it's a very small paperback so I was not surprised that the price was low but I would have gladly paid more to have a more readable copy. If I had known it's true condition, I would have not ordered it."
2,Simple ... Very Simple,"This book was recommended to use first NO MATTER WHAT grade level your child is. Then, you could skip to the appropriate level book for your child. ***Please note, that I'm sure the book is fine for the K-2 that it is recommended for. However, I believe it is a waste of money for the 4th and up grades, and therefore not necessary to use first."
5,It's Joneeba Time!,"This is an excellent workout. I love the dancing and the African drums, I also bought his book and the cd. I plan to teach it to the youth this summer. Energetic and Fun. I can't wait...I hope there is another one to follow."
5,Wifes Birthday Gift,"Took a chance and was not disappointed. Well crafted, finished and functional. Was last minute birthday gift for wife and could not find an appropriate, well made and attractive dresser top jewelry box anywhere. This fit the bill perfectly and she was very happy (and a happy wife = happy husband). The flip up upper tray is a nice touch. Have yet to engrave the box top brass plate but will soon."
3,studies in disillusionment and chaos,"THis collection is one of Naipaul's darkest. While I dutifully plowed through it, I was depressed by the emptiness and psycholigical terror of just about every story. THe Novella of the title is a sad journey in Africa made by two residents of a roped-off European area, through the background of appalling civil war that eventually touches them. They are mediocrities with nowhere else to go, one the aging wife of a has-been journalist, the other a man who exploits poverty-stricken male prostitutes. THe other stories are similarly bleak. One tells of a beaten-down man who is trying to help his brother as they struggle to emigrate to England. Another recounts the misadventures of an Indian man who moves to Washington, DC and marries an American black woman by default.It is a strange collection of stories and travel, a testament to despair and chaos. Naipaul's other books are better and have far more humor."
3,Strange tales,"This is a well-written work by a master artist, but it is more in an experimental vein. It is a very strange book to read. The first story about a poor Indian immigrant to the US is interesting and fizzles to an end. The second, about Caribbean immigrants to UK is also cryptic and strange. I did not get the fact that the leading man was in jail for murder. Other reviews on Amazon.com informed me of this fact. The title piece is a strange dream about two whites on a road trip in an African country that is erupting into civil war. Nothing really happens, the arguments are prickly and the ending is mystifying. A bizarre book to read."
2,In a free state,"I am a big fan of VS Naipaul, but this one I don't know. Three times I picked up this book, and all 3 times I get half way and got bored.The first story was fun but Like baseball 3 strikes your out!"
5,Awesome Texas Movie! - by West Texas gal!,This is a great movie for all ages! I loved it!! I think it is great for kids to see this movie - raising animals teaches so much!! I strongly suggest buying this movie for your family and friends!
5,Sweet kid's flick that adults will enjoy!,I took my 10 year old niece to see this movie - she's an avid rider! - and we both fell in love with it! A very sweet flick that can hold the interest of both a child and a grown up! Enjoy!!
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,If you have a love for 4-H or FFA - this is a must watch! Best movie ever - watch it with your kids!
5,Old fashioned family fun movie....a must see!,"It is so great to see a movie that isnt about violence and special effects. Grand Champion is a down home family movie that is great for the whole family (Grandma too) The story of Hokey Pokey, the prize winning steer and his journey to become the Grand Champion. Along the way, the kids and Hokey encounter the likes of Natalie Maines, Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, Larry Maham, George Strait and many many more.Funny, true to life, simple, charming and a fantastic soundtrack all add to the Grand Champion experience. Take a break, do yourself a favor and get this DVD today!"
5,Great Family Movie!,"I watched this movie with my entire family including my mother-in-law. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. Although aimed at younger viewers, we adults got a kick out of it also. There is a definite need for more movies like Grand Champion! If you are from Texas you will enjoy it even more since you will recognize many of the locations in the movie."
5,A darling family film!!,"I missed this little gem of a film when it was in the theaters but purchased the DVD on a friend's recommendation. Grand Champion is such a refreshing departure from all the heavy-handed flicks that the studios are shoving toward children these days. The story is simple and sweet yet inspirational and fun. My kids loved it! Julia Roberts has a small but memorable role where she shares a very touching moment with her niece, Emma. Bruce Willis is charming as ever. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for fun, yet substantive family entertainment."
4,It was Joey's movie,"For me, Joey Lauren Adams was the glue that held ""Grand Champion"" together, just as her character, Hallie, held her family and farm together. Once again, Joey has given us a touching, inspiring performance in an admirable role ... approporiate for such an admirable woman."
5,Grand Champion,Fun Family movie with a great cast. Emma Roberts is a future star and is delightful in this film. If you like the rodeo or want just good clean family fun this is a great film!
5,After Effects 5.0/5.5 Hands-On Training,"Want a straight-forward, lesson oriented, explain-why-you-are-doing-it-this-way-with-the-alternatives-listed method to learn After Effects 5.5? I am experienced with Photoshop and Premiere but new to After Effects. This book is thorough but very easy. It includes ALL the steps so even I can't get lost. The book grounded me in all the basics. When my son returned from snowboarding with video, I used it to produce a wonderfully professional 20 second introduction from scratch and imported it into Premiere. Much better than the Adobe book that came with the program. CD-ROM is included with book."
2,A watse of time and money,"This book is totally for beginners who have never been using after effects before. If you already have used after effecrs even for a while , defintly you would never want to refer to this book.Linda books might be good when it comes to web authoring. But as a matter of fact I do not think that it is a good refrence when it comes to digital video editing. I recommend (Creating Motion Graphics with After Effects) written by Trish Meyer, Chris Meyer. This book is really good a part of it covers all the levels from advanced to user. And guess what now the latest version is out covers A.F 5 and 5.5 get that one and you will never regret it ,"
2,NO MORE GOLF TALK!,"This book was both entertaining AND annoying. If you love golfand interracial romance then this is the book for you! I thoughtthe story line was far-fetched.. but who doesn't enjoy reading aboutmeddlesome family members! And jesus... so much golf talk. That was theboring aspect of the book. So I give it two stars. Less golf, more loveand romance and I would have given it 3+ stars."
4,"Upbeat, funky euro club mix",Good music to work out to or just to listen to when you want to get goin'
5,Very Good Music,This is an excellent CD by an excellent artist who sadly was over looked here in the states
1,GPX fails,Bought this for my daughter who really wanted to listen to 1560 AM and various FM stations. AM reception very poor especially in the car. FM reception is sporadic. Had to return it. Still looking for something that will work that is reasonably priced.
2,Armband/belt clip useless,"Overall the radio is not bad for a small little radio, but the armband is very small, wont fit most men, and is not durable. The belt clip is a poor design in that it un clips its self from the radio when you clip it on a thicker belt. sound is good but the reception is only fair at best"
1,don't waste your money! terrible design,got no further than trying to install batteries....am getting sick and tired at all the junk imports from china....this clump of dog poo is headed back to the store...
2,Guide to Vintage Drums Book Review,"Disappointing coverage of the vintage drums due to all black and white photos.The author's own website currently has much better pictures in full color. I realize this book was done in 94,but there was still an availability of color pictures from old drum catalogs which are now collectors items in themselves. Thought alot of the history was sketchy and not nearly as detailed or complete as The Great American Drum Co's.by Canagy. Felt it was an amateur attempt to put an inferior book out on vintage drums.Illustrations were dark and overall quality was poor.Various books on individual drum co's are much better sources.(i.e.Rob Cook's books). May be worth a look at the bookstore but not a must have reference for your library! Surely the experts on vintage drums could collectively compile a much better and more informative and valuable book and price guide on this subject.Vintage drum magazines and articles will have to do till a better book comes along."
1,Didn't Help with Crises,"Since I bought this book, I've had three crises with my senior horse. And in each case, this book was useless. It didn't cover what to do when my horse came down with the neurological form of equine herpesvirus! For colic, it didn't mention Banamine. Banamine is no where in this book. For ulcers, it had minimal solutions.Their formula for measuring a horse to determine its weight is for the metric system, not the English system we use. But they use inches, not meters.Another ridiculous section -- they suggest using ""cold-pressed"" oils to add to your horse's feed. I checked into this -- these oils are EXPENSIVE!!!!I thought this book would be wonderful. It's not. Save your money. The Internet has more useful and free sites."
1,Self Serving,"This is a ridiculous book, it does not offer any useful advice, it simply leads the reader through a series of questions that always result in a recommendation to call your vet.No wonder as the author and one of the editors is a vet.Do not buy!!!(..)"
4,Great product,"I decided to buy it after reading all the reviews. My kids are 8 and 6 and they absolutely love it. My 6 years old needs help from time to time, but that really helps with his logical thinking. I tried playing it a little bit and it's pretty fun!"
4,Puzzled Leapster Game,"This game is a little challenging at times for my 4 year old and even my 6 year old, but I have found they can solve the puzzles and they have learned to have a little patience and keep trying!"
4,"Happy with this one, too!",My grand daughter likes this game very much. It makes this grandma happy when the grand kids are happy!!
1,Prevention PV-175 Electronic Pillbox/Timer,"Faulty, battery was stuck in place, insulator tongue difficult to remove and when it was finally removed, display remained blank."
1,Prevention Pillbox / Timer,Alarm did not work - right out of the box. Another quality Made In China item. Don't waste your money on this cheap toy.
1,Prevention pillbox disappointment,"I just bought this pillbox/timer so I would not forget to take my pills anymore, unfortunately the alarm did not work. It kept good time, but the alarm never went off. It has a warranty, however you have to send a check for $3.95 to cover shipping & handling, and to send it back I would have to pay another $5.00 so I rather take this one as a loss, and spend that money to buy another brand. Very disappointed."
1,difficult to program; battery won't stay in place,I had what appeared to be an identical model for 15 years- this was in no way nearly as good. I'll switch to a different model.
3,Prevention PV-175 Electronic Pillbox/Timer,"Reviews for this item were necessary for me to figure out how to set it. It came with directions that were not helpful at all. I finally figured out that it is only a countdown timer with no clock and does not stop flashing. Continues to flash until time counts down then needs to be re-set. The buttons are easy to accidentally push rendering the device useless as a reminder. I will use it but only as a pillbox which is a good size to keep medications safe and dry, fits in pocket or purse and will rely on my alarm watch to tell me when to take my medication."
2,Dissappointing timer,"This is a good pill box with a poor timer. Would be better off with an alarm clock. You can only set it for up to 23 hours and 59 minutes and it's inaccurate and must be reset daily. I wanted it to keep track of mid afternoon dose, not good...."
1,wasted ten bucks,I just received my pill box timer and there were absolutely no directions. I activated the battery and nothing happened when I pushed the hour and minute button. Seeing that people have had so much trouble with them....guess I'll just chalk it up a bad choice. Wouldn't have given one star but I had to rate it!
3,Worked but there was something better.,"My dad has really bad heartburn and he wanted me to post a review on here to share what he thought about this product. He used it and it worked pretty well for him but, he was tired of buying it over and over and wanted to find something more permanent. We searched and finally found him something that was inexpensive. He hasn't had any problems with his heartburn or acid reflux since he bought it. So he wanted me to share it with you and tell you to try it out before you spend anymore hard earned money on another short-term medication.Just copy the link below into your browser and check it out.[...]"
1,Buy Standard Deviants,"BUY Standard Deviants School - DVD's which are same program as this and price are way cheaper. All the chapters are one and the same, only the cover page is different"
2,Poorly done,"This is a very poor, disorganized account of events associated with the burning of Washington and the battle of Bladensburg, Md. The author appears to have thrown in every detail and fact he came across into the narrative no matter how trivial. The author has apparently not been trained in how to sift through evidence to produce a coherent account of the events."
2,interesting revisit,"This is an excellent study into the social and political aspects of the incident. Details the actions of the people of Washington and each, and it would seem every, dish that was broken. The battles are cover only mildly to bring you to the 'burning' and afterwards to bring conclusion. A wonderful book for the interested reader, but not so much for military battle analysis. This book only goes into details of the 'burning' making it more of a tour guide than a history of the invasion. On the invasion there are far better titles.Honestly, I found Walter Lord's book to be worth a second read and not happy with this title.Make SURE this book is what you want to read about."
3,Great cookies...price is exorbitant,"Yes, the cookies are wonderful, but $8.99 for a 12-ounce bag? I get them for $4.59 at my small independent natural food store. And I'm not in a low cost shipping area.If these cookies were $6 they would rank in the top 10,000 at Amazon. Sell them for $5 and they could get to 5,000. Everybody likes to make a buck, but I think they are being a little ambitious at $9 a bag.I give the cookies 6 stars, but take away 3 for vendor greed."
5,"We have them at the local grocery store in Independence, MO","We have them at the local HyVee in Independence, MO for $3.89 for the 12 oz bag. I tasted them for the first time last week and man I am in love!!! I am already on my second bag. I hope I can exercise and cut down on other things to keep healthy."
2,rip-off,"The price for 12 oz of these cookies is absurd. They are good, but not worth the money. Buy them at Costco (24 oz bags) for less!!"
5,Grace's really and the best.....Cookies,These little unassuming cookies are great. All natural ingredients and great taste. I have been hooked on these for about a year. I will need to get some more soon. Try them you will like them too....
5,Great Music,This CD is excellent. Love the first piece on there - Warsaw Concerto. We don't hear enough music like this anymore
5,"""Moosically"" Delightful!","Having taught music for over 20 years, I am rarely delighted with a children's CD. This one is as fresh as the farm with clever hoof tappin' tunes! I can't wait to listen to Brent's other albums. I am always looking for the highest quality songs to teach my ""kids."" This one is a keeper!"
5,Very fun music,"I know this is supposed to be kids music, but even though my son has outgrown it I still like to listen to it. The songs are just plain fun."
2,Private Lives of...Davis and Flynn,"Maxwell Anderson never let established historical fact stand in the way of a good melodrama or an opportunity for the actors to chew lots of scenery. This film is a showcase for Bette Davis and Erroll Flynn and really has very little to do with Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex. In the light of Hollywood's traditional contempt for actual history, I can't judge the film too harshly on those grounds. But it does gall me that they chose to whitewash a maniac (Essex) while making good men like Cecil etc. into conspiring villains."
3,Maybe she had tennis elbow?,"If this film had starred anyone other than Bette Davis I might have rated it higher. Good grief, what is with those flailing arms of hers? She uses them as punctuation marks! Where is the cool suave Bette that we see in All About Eve? Bette is simply over the top in this film, which is too bad because this is an otherwise good film. Errol Flynn is just as he should be: vigorous, virulent, gorgeous and at the top of his acting form. Poor Olivia DeHavilland gets short shrift as a romantic interest for Essex, but that is all explained away in the very excellent extra features included with the DVD.The plot is good, the script is intelligent, the costumes, photgraphy and music are top notch. I'm glad I bought the film as it is good enough to see over again in spite of Bette Davis' windmill impersonation."
1,Technicolor terribly out of registration!,"This is so incredibly frustrating -- this film was one of the most beautiful and lavish Technicolor productions done (pre-Gone With The Wind) when it was released in November of 1939. And while the DVD attests to its glory, many, many shots are terribly out of register -- the Technicolor having a ""3D without the glasses"" look. What was Warner Brothers thinking to release it on DVD in this state?? Did they think that no one would notice? One shot will be perfectly gorgeous and the next shot is halloed. Better not to have released it than to have sent it out like this. To true movie lovers it's unwatchable."
2,Five years after the Civil War,"Having lost his rank during the peace time following the Civil War, a glory-hunting Major Burkhalter's ambition is to get his brevet brigadier general star back. Wanting only this promotion regardless of soldier loss, Major Burkhalter goes against orders and carries out his second secret attack, claiming the Cheyennes are pillaging white settlers. I found this fictional paperback to have very few merits in its favor. Even though I read every word of it, at the end I felt the novel was not entertaining nor worth my time."
4,little expensive,Although a little expensive - this pedal works really well. When bypassed - you cannot even tell that a pedal is inline unlike other pedals that dampen your sound.
4,Overpriced but outstanding tone,"The good: Phaser tones like no other. I wanted to buy the cheaper orange one---I really did. But I played this one and the orange MX90 back to back time after time, and this one just sounds better. The block-letter tone is sharper and crisper; the script tone is lush and sweeping.The not-so-great: This pedal is overpriced, even for the outstanding tone. I bought it anyway, but the price should be less than $100. A second concern: This one doesn't feel quite as sturdy as the standard orange one or the Zakk Wylde one. Maybe it's just the finish but the case on this one seems more fragile."
2,Not so much,"While this is full of information, it wasn't really what I was looking for. This might be good for kids over 10/12, however it's presented w/ silly science experiments that they may be too cool for, by that age.Basically, it's complex science w/ silly experiments. My daughter likes doing the experiments, but she doesn't get much out of them because the science is too advanced."
2,Science Project Book,I paid extra to receive this book in a few days because my daughter was working on a science project and we needed the book very quickly. I ordered two books that day. The first one I received the next day. This book took almost a week to get here which was way too late and a waste of extra money to have it shipped quickly.
2,Caffeine Clout,"I liked this book because it makes a good showing on my shelf. People at my house say ""Akmed, you are a coffee chemist?"" I say, ""yes, everything coffee does for me this book can undo. Ever drank too much coffee and can't sleep? This book solves that problem! Sleep for days after reading this book! I did. And you can too."" One of my friends borrowed the book just before she quit coffee and died of severe depression. I'm not saying she read the book, but carrying it around seem to have the same effect. I hope everyone with too much time and energy will read this book, as they too will suffer a lingering malaise."
5,retelling stories with GREAT props!!,"When children listen to and begin to retell stories, using props like these felt pieces are not only enjoyable but helpful in their learning to understand story sequencing (beginning reading skill). Take it from a kindergarten/pre-k teacher, this is a wonderful ""story time"" alternative after the book has been read again and again!! Great colors of felt and good size for small hands and plenty of pieces to be able to retell the story, even if you ""change it up"" and makeup your own story!!!"
4,Interesting characters in a regency with a twist!,I really enjoyed the characters in this story. This new author provided a good plot with a different twist to the governess meets powerful guy story! I found the book held my interest and I look forward to reading more from Ms. Woodward. I always like to see local authors in the bookstore.
5,A Fantastic Regency,"Drake is a hero to swoon for. And poor Celia dislikes him too much to see it. This was a lovely light regency Rom com. My only wish is that we actually got to see the hero's realization that he was in love. He tells the heroine in a cute scene, but we the reader are not specifically clued in via mind-voice. We are told how much she vexed him and how attractive she is and all that but we don't get to watch him make the switch. He was so against being married and then came the scene at Almack's and we knew something was afoot but while he only hinted at it, he never states that he actually intends marriage. That however is my only criticism. Otherwise this novel was flawless. A Cute Regency Cinderella story with only one wicked mistress. Very highly recommended for all Regency Romance lovers."
5,Yay Chris Shiflett!,"Ok, coming from a huge Foo Fighters fan, how can you not love Chris Shiflett? Jackson United is a great band. I really enjoy the tracks tittled, ""All the Way,"" and ""Fell Into.""Jackson United's second album, ""White Flag Burning"" is just as awesome, definitely check them out!"
2,Full-sized eeBoo cards are excellent; the tiny ones are useless,"I found a deck of eeBoo cards at a local secondhand shop and the whole family LOVED them. I thought I'd get a set of other card games from the same manufacturer. Unfortunately, when the set arrived, the cards were TINY! My 4 and 5 year olds both had trouble holding them (heck, so did mom and I!), but thankfully returning them was a breeze. These cards are beautifully illustrated and very durable, but the dimensions are not accurate on the amazon page for this and the ""volume 1"" sets."
1,CD label is incorrect: Songs are NOT by these artists,"The CD notes indicate (falsely) that these songs are by the original artists. But unfortunately, this disc is just some guy who re-did all the songs. Not sure what the point of that was! But this CD is rather disappointing, to say the least."
3,Cool Book,"This is a great book to read in a weekend. I love the characters Anna, Molly & Lyn, who are the Ghost Hunter's Club. In this book, the girls are trying to find out why the ghost, Elizabeth Sullivan is still hanging around. There are a lot of surprises and the other characters are funny too, even the Widow Miller! She's so mean! Anyway, I think this is a pretty good book. I am gonna tell all of my friends about it! I would like to know more about the author though. Is she gonna write more? I hope so....and this book would be a fun show for Nick or Disney to pick up. I could see a lot of kids from my school watching it. Everybody loves ghosts! And this story makes you want to put together your own Ghost Hunter's Club!!"
3,Decent and stylish but not very hardy!,"I got my vaio about a year back to replace an aging desktop. In about 6 months, a couple of keys came off but sony support replaced those immediately.I'e had some problems wiht the operating system- for instance, internet explorer will not show some images on websites. Its irritating (is it SP2? I dont know). ALso, the beautiful case gets scratched easily adn the screen seems very delicate- I dont carry it around too much and I am afraid to.But otherwise it is a great little machine which I can take around and use anywhere in the house. Very pretty, very smart only thing is needs more strength."
2,My Hard Drive died after 15 Months,"Do not buy this sony laptop. It has a sleek design and stylish look but does not have a lot of features and also beware of your hard drive as it dies in little over an year.Sony support sucks and they wont even let me know about the nearest sony support center until they bill me for the time I spoke to their support guy. Their support is also very expensive.Thank god I did not need to spend $750(as per their website) and send my laptop and wait until they fix it, as I got it replaced the hard drive which I bought online for less than $300. Very bad experience with the laptop and their support. My friends who bought Dell and Toshiba for $1300's (cheap when compare with what I spend $2000) around the same time I bought this Sony viao are using them without any problems and good features and great support. On an overall I am not buying any Sony laptop in future."
2,"Yep, Hard Drive Died...beware","Have been pretty happy with this for two years -- lightweight, reasonable performance. I take it with me everywhere.Hard drive gave signs of dying, and finally gave up the ghost this week. I would probably give this three stars because it gave me a relatively useful life, but the Sony support has been very poor. Review sites like this make it clear that hard drive failures are common for this product, but Sony buries and obscures hard drive assistance online. Frustrating."
3,"Nice, but...","I can't complain too much, as I got this computer two years ago for around $1400 on sale, which seems to be less than most paid. Mostly it's been a great computer, long battery life, and the screen is still in great shape after 2 years. I haven't had any problems with the case scuffing, and I just use a normal laptop bag to carry it around. However, the hard drive did fail right at 15 months. In my case it was the read heads (which seems to be the common failure mode), but the problem was slow enough to develop I had time to move all of my data off the drive before it completely died. I just recently replaced it with a relatively cheap 80GB 5400 RPM drive and everything works great, plus it runs faster than it ever did with the original 4200 RPM drive that was installed. If you get this computer, do yourself a favor and replace the HD with a 5400 RPM drive, it makes what's already (still) a good computer even a little better."
5,Quality Ethernet Cables,"I have continued to stick with Belkin on Ethernet cables and have yet to fail. They are quality products at a reasonable price.The feature on these cables is that the end connectors are protected, so there is a significant less chance of breaking off the plastic snaps that lock it to the Ethernet port.Excellent product!"
5,Clips didnt break! The clips didn't break!,"Alright, so this cable gets passed around my house on a semi-daily basis. It gets used and abused, in out in out of laptops all day long. Anyways, the clip has yet to break... and I mean there were some close calls where I was a bit rough or a friend was a bit rough and I thought that is it, it is dead but no... The clip just isn't breaking.. will update when it does.Long story short.. The clip doesn't break cable works as expected."
1,This is a cookie?,"Sorry, I really didn't care for these cookies. Weird mealy texture, flat taste. I've never met a cookie I didn't like - until now. Couldn't even finish one. I gave them away and the recipients said they tasted like ""nutrition bars"". I'd never buy them again."
3,Breakfast cookies,I was a little disappointed in these. I am a very healthy eater and was excited about them at first. But the oatmeal raisin are bland in taste. I did like the apple pie flavor. Sure wish they added some cinnamon to the oatmeal raisin. It would have improved the flavor immensly.
4,Go Speed Go!,"You either love him or hate him, but you have to respect his mixing skills. This mix starts off with a bang (everybody thinks i'm high) and twists and turns every which way. A few tracks in the middle lacked the normal Keoki umph, but I know it keeps me moving. Trully, a Techno God!"
4,Analysis of Zep's first album,"Rock Milestones: Led Zeppelin's First Album (2006) examines and analyzes the first album (released in 1968) of this legendary hard rock band. Some in-depth analysis is done on the following songs: Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, You Shook Me, Dazed And Confused, and Communication Breakdown. Leading critics and rock journalists give their views and opinions. A lot of rare footage of the band can be found on this DVD.The back of the DVD case is poorly edited, as if some careless person typed it up. Other than that, it's a pretty solid and entertaining DVD that I recommend."
2,"Ok, if you want to know how the band began","I wanted to hear the band playing songs, not necessarily a documentary on how the band came together. I stopped playing it half-way through, so I don't even know if any songs were played in their entirety (without documentary-type comments interrupting them) before the DVD ended. If you're into the bands' history, you might like this DVD."
3,Two Component Signal Transduction,The book is a good reference for those who are interested in Two-component signal transductions. The book discusses the basic characteristics of a two component system. The book also touches on several paradigm of two-component systems with an in-depth analysis of each system.
2,Not as fresh as in store -- some nuts rancid and inedible,"These products are excellent when bought at a local store, but what I got, in spite of being five months from its ""sell by"" date, tasted decidedly antique. This was also true to a lesser degree of the ""Soccorro"" Macadamia / hazelnut snacks from Sahale. However, the ""Soledad"" almonds and ""Valdosta"" pecans were excellent, just as are those from the store."
5,My Kind of Book,"This is the kind of book that you can use for inspiration for all kinds of scrapbooking, party favors, card making, decorating, you name it. I love her attention to detail that I think adds more personality to your project than big bucks. If she were to write another book, I would buy it sight unseen."
2,Nice Book but Been There and Done That,"I recently became aquainted with the art of Dena Fishbein and love what she does so came to Amazon to see what they had available. I found Embellish Your Home and the price was very attractive so I ordered it. Dena has some fabric and paper goods on the market that are wonderful so I was excited to see what this book would have to offer. I was really kind of disappointed with it. It felt like ""been there and done that"" but it is an older book. That would be why it is priced so low. Duh! I enjoyed looking through it and did learn some techniques that could be used in an updated way so it was not a total loss. It was like looking at a magazine that was nice but now you've read it so put it aside for the next trip to donate to charity. If you look at it like that, you won't be disappointed. With the price of magazines these days, it was not priced out of line. The painted furniture was the saving grace to the whole thing."
4,Comments from a grieving grandfather,"This book is excellent, in that it provides the distressed reader with many writings of gifted authors. It is not a book to be read at one sitting, as it can be overwhelming.I would recommend that a person interested in this book read my review of ""A Child Dies - A portrait of family grief"". This book was the better of the two, in the view of my family - however I recommend both.""A Broken Heart"" contains many episodes which are based on fiction, which seemed less meaningful than the words of those whom have actually suffered a loss. Though the words are always wonderfully crafted, fiction did not have the meaning of the words of reality."
4,Classic,You'll have to be a true hip hop head to enjoy this one I'm old school and haven't heard this in so long enjoyed it greatly
2,Weak at best. bunk game save your cash.......,"I bought this game for my sons thinking it would have all the monster circuit trucks like grave digger/ el toro loco etc.. but none of those trucks are in the game i think monster jam and ubisoft had some finacial disputes which is a real shame, I spent 27 $ on this game the only good part of it was the location sites, the graphics were the same quality as there last game ubisoft put out. save your money buy the last one older version."
5,Inspirational!,"This book was very different than any other book that I have read on Everest. The author offered very clear insights and lessons that can be applied to everyday life. At first I was disappointed and wanted to return the book, but after reading the first few pages, I appreciated it greatly. If you want a technical book on climbing Mount Everest, this is not for you. If you give it a try, however, like I did, you may learn some very valuable lessons on life. Go for it! Thank you to the author for inspiring others."
4,Great!,Great service! Received it in a decent amount of time. The book was in really good shape and it was a great buy!
4,Simple = best,"For those who purchased this book looking for a dramatic story about Mt. Everest and didn't notice that it was also a tome on personal growth, you should ashamed of yourself! Perhaps you should learn how to read, or not read at all. The point of the book is not the goal, but the journey and the lessons learned along the way. Each lesson is very simple and clear; the way lessons should be. The concepts described reminded me of the ones found in ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior""; both books are concise and easily understandable. The story may be lacking in drama, but again, that's not what this book is about. A great read for anyone in business."
4,Comfort!,"We had tried several belts for an extremely thin employee, all were uncomfortable, some cut into the back. This belt gives needed support, while still being comfortable."
5,A Masterpiece of the Genre,"The hardback volume is a masterpiece of thecraft.It is over-sized, has hard, glossy covers withsturdy binding, a magnificently-illustratedwrap-around cover and awesome illustratedend-pages.The interior illustrations are first-class. Onemay have a tendency to skim through themto get along with the story but it is worthlingering over each one to appreciate thequality, imagination and detail of each panel.The story itself is gripping and convoluted.It has a bit of authentic history at the beginning,then leaps into the near-future. There aremysteries, fear and a frightful, fascinatingunderwater setting. There is an unusual attentionto the characterization and the back-stories of themain protagonists. The tension that the crewundergoes is credible.In sum, it is the finest graphic novel that I haveever seen."
3,Not as good as the unscented ones,"After talking to our friend, the infant ICU nurse, I was surprised to learn that they do not wipe babies after wet diapers due to irritation caused by conventional wipes.Tushies unscented wipes are the best. Our daughter never had a case of diaper rash while using it. It is free of any potentially toxic chemicals, unlike every other baby wipe out there (even 7th Gen which has polysorbate-20).My wife insisted that we get the scented instead of the unscented Tushies the second time around because of the dirty diaper smell. I wish we had stuck with the unscented ones.The scented wipes are not folded to continuously dispense out of your refillable wipes container. We have to open the dispenser all the time. I'd recommend the unscented ones for anyone, as the scented wipes are jsut a hassle."
2,Great story - disappointing book,"I always liked Rikki-Tikki-Tavi ever since I first read it as a kid in 4th grade. I recently bought this book for my daughter. I was disappointed that this 'book' felt more like a finely printed pamphlet consisting of only a few pages stapled together, rather than a children's book with larger and clearer font. It does not have a 'kids book' feel to it - more like a 'rental car contract fine print' version.The story of course, independent of the packaging in this disappointing book, is an all-time classic and a must-read. Kids will enjoy it. Just find a better book with illustrations and a kids-feel to it if you want to gift it to a kid."
4,Rikki Tikki Tavi,I liked Rikki Tikki Tavi it was a really good book. There were lots of exciting and unexpected things happening. I liked the characters - my favourite was Rikki Tikki. It was interesting to learn about the mongoose.
4,Riki tiki tavy,Great read....Definitely a page turner with a cool concept and interesting characters. Action packed and full of adventure...
4,Riki Tiki Tavi,I was happy to find this book out there. I have fond memories of reading it many years ago in school. I still think it is a great story.
5,Childhood memories,My mother read this book to me when I was a child and I loved it. Now I am reading it to my boys and they love it.
4,A nice short tale,As always Kipling quickly sets the Indian scene - grabs our attention and tells a great short story. A classic as relevant today as it was when Kipling first wrote it.
5,A childhood favorite,A wonderful children's story that will delight. If you have a child they will enjoy this short but entertaining story.
5,Great Read,"I remember watching the cartoon as a kid. It follows the book completely. Excellent story for bedtime, my niece loves it."
3,hard to hear dialogue,"The story is very nice. It keeps the kids quiet in the car while they are listening and they have asked to listen to it several times. The only problem is that with the volume up to max it is still hard to hear at times. Even when we listened to it at home, still the volume has to be at max level. The music parts come in very loudly though so be prepared to turn it down for those parts!If it weren't so hard to hear the dialogue I'd give it five stars. This seams to be a problem with Naxos audio CDs because it is the same problem with other audio CDs from Naxos."
1,Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,I loved this book it is one of my favorite book we read it at our school sometimes for test.
3,A wondeful book by a not so wonderful author,"Dear readers,a few weeks ago I read a book called Rikki Tikki Tavi. It's a kind of weird story about a mongoose who is washed from his home and into an Indian family's garden. This where a small boy named Teddy picked the mongoose, a.k.a. Rikki Tikki, up and kept him as a pet and a guardian. After this Rikki Tikki decides to explore the land outside of the house. This is where he meets Nag and Nagina(both are cobras). This is also where he begins his war aginst the snakes. So as you can see this a very interesting story with a great moral,""Never let your guard down""'."
1,Not the original text!!!,"This has been rewritten to dumb it down. The beautiful language originally used by him has been replaced with dumber versions, and entire paragraphs have been removed. As someone who read and loved the original story as a child, I was very disappointed to see this when I began reading it to my 7 year old son."
5,It's perfect!,"Nicely formatted with no errors. I love this story and Mr. Kipling , I love you too! Rikki-Tikki-Tavi is one of the best stories. Ever!"
4,Sweet and Simple,"What a sweet and fun story! I honestly must admit that I had never read this story before but I came across it on Amazon and wanted to check it out to see if it would be something my nephews/nieces enjoyed. Such a great story of bravery and loyalty that I think all kids could enjoy. I'll definitely be sharing it not only with my own nephews and nieces, but with those friends who have kids of their own."
4,Good children's story,This was one of my favorite stories as a child growing up and still is to this day. I recommend this for anyone of any age.
5,Wonderful descriptions,My 8 year old neice and I read this together. She loved the strange names and animals. We had to look up a picture of a mongoose when we were done.
4,Bike wrecks and good stuff,I had this story in my reading textbook at school and we didn't finish it so when I wrecked my bike and filleted my leg open and my x-grandfather bought me a kindle fire hd I got this short story I like it a lot
5,Science that makes connections,"Science books have a history of being droll, filled with amorphous and incomprehensible graphs, facts and statistics. At long last, here is a book both parents and kids can learn from and enjoy studying, perusing, or just laughing with page by page. If school districts would adopt this book, they would see student comprehension and involvement jump off the page. Or perhaps this should be de rigeur summer reading for middle schoolers. Though I am well past that stage, I learned a lot about science and systems and wish I had a book like this when I was 13 or 14. Maybe science and math educators could take a gander at this book and rethink ways to reach students better. This book is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise polluted science learning atmosphere."
4,Good review or for beginners,"I purchased this book as a review of general science knowledge for taking the Praxis 2 middle school science test. I am strong in science and just needed a quick dusting of my memory. This book did just that in an easy to read and understand manner. It provides illustrations and examples that explain the point in a way in which ""common Joes"" can understand. It however, does not go into detail, such as give formulations used in general chemistry. I believe this would be excellent reading for a young student who might not understand basic principles or if clarification with real world examples are needed. I also liked how common questions that arise from seemingly contradictions in science are addressed. It is colorful and fun to read."
3,source for book,"If you want to buy The Making of a Student-Athlete, go to www.varsityedge.com or www.athletesadvisor.com and buy it directly from the authors, since it's not available here. I have no opinion on the book, but am providing this information as a public service."
2,See thru,"I guess I should have read the description better, but this back pack is see thru and has holey material. If you don't mind that it is a nice bag and a good size and zips nicely."
4,Not bad for a romantic historic fiction,"I've read all of Chadwicks latest books, but have hesitated with her earlier ones because they are more romantic than historic. I decided to try this one anyway, and am glad I did. Yes, its romantic, and very predictable - but it still has Chadwicks uncanny way of bringing the time and place to the forefront. There are no anachronisms here, nothing that will throw you out of the book with a WTF moment. As usual, her characters are the type you care about, and her story one that keeps you reading, even tho you know whats going to happen. Its not one of her best, but even this is heads above most any other author of the genre."
4,"same book, different author?","I have had this book for a number of years - it's on my keeper shelf, and probably is rising again to the top of the re-reads~BUT MY copy, 1994, of ""Shields of Pride"" has Elizabeth Chadwick as the author of this Ballantine/Random publ. book - was this first done as a pseudonym? or is the name ""Chadwick"" the pseudonym?? or is this a mistake - however, to paraphrase, ""a book by any other author"" remains a good read."
5,Carmen Miranda Hat,"I play Jimmy Buffett tunes frequently in bands and also was in a JB Tribute Band. I loved wearing this hat in particular when we played ""Fruitcakes"". Fun hat that has made it through tours ;-)"
4,I have been looking for a CD like this for a long time.,real love by lil'johnna was great. if your looking for a CD to buy get this one.
5,Freestyle Latin The Right Way,Freestyle Latin 3 is definitely one of the best freestyle compilations out there. As a dj i know how hard it is to find good music and this album is defintely a good one. If u enjoy good freestyle the way i do and so many other clubers do ull get this album.
1,Over priced cheap toy at best Solar ventilator Vent Fan for toy house,It is not anything but a toy. It cannot be made water tight as it is.At best an over priced toy worth 5 dollars.
1,Crap,"I am using this ""vent"" in a 4'x4' outhouse. The unit can't begin to vent this space. I installed it exactly like the instructions and it pulls very little air even when the sun is shining bright on the unit. I won't bother buying this again for my other buildings."
1,Internet rip off,"This unit was a joke, don't waist your time or money. Another Chinese knock off to get your money. Buy American!"
2,Okay,"I looked for awhile for a book on this Nazi and was disappointed in this one. I don't know what I expected, but this was not it."
5,a real winner,"this really is a beautiful piece of furniture, it is hard to believe that so much attention to detail and quality has gone into childrens furniture. the hinges are the type that won't close and trap unsuspecting little fingers, the carvings and the colurs are really vibrant without being garish like some other play room furniture, it really completes a childs room to have a toy box and for me this is a real winner"
3,Damaged at arrival,"The toy chest came in damaged in number of places, particularly chipped at the bottom partition and a piece broken off at the cover. There were some scratches in various other locations. I was not happy with the quality of construction due to pressed wood that does not lend itself to being very durable. However the customer service refunded the money, since we did not want a new one. The carvings are pretty and walls look solid, bottom partition looks week."
3,Practical Ideas,"Lots of writing prompts for young students. Some of them are silly- but if you choose carefully, and if you introduce these with solid introductions, these can provide lessons that are rather imaginative."
2,Had to return,"I thought that a simple cable would work and then after reading the reviews I thought it would be fine. No luck! Had to return and purchase another brand. It's only a few dollars, but I was disappointed it didn't work on my printer."
5,Belkin USB Cable,This cable is an ideal multi use USB cable. It is excellent for connecting a fax machine to a computer. It can be used for most functions requiing a 2.0 USB cable.
1,Never Buy from This seller,"I bought the new printer cable & because of my injury I couldn't try to install printer within a month, found out cable is broken & I can't return it either. Waste of money & time as couldn't suspect that new cable could be broken so took time to figure that out."
5,Perfect,I wanted to move my printer and this was the perfect fix. No problems in the month I have been using it.
5,USB Printer -Brother,"I have to admit its super long but i didnt regret it after my new set up in my room. I couldnt put the printer on my top of my desk because of my dual monitor and small speaker set. Aside from there, my boyfriend would have his stuff on my workstate as well. So i placed it on the table behind me. 10ft seriously was super long but it came in handy when you have to move things around.For me, it was more of the thoughts of being safe than sorry. I hate buying things twice especially with the short ends.It never got in the way for me, i guess because i wired and kept it organized. :)"
5,Outstanding choice,"Belkin Pro Series USB 2.0 Device Cable (USB A/USB B, 10 Feet)My printer manufacturer wanted 3 times as much as this for only a 6' cable, and the big box chain store didn't have it. This is an outstanding product and excellent buy. Shipping was 2 days."
4,Works as it should,good product as most I have had fromm Belkin are and on here the price was good compared to local stores with the same product.
2,sure didn't need this!,it was suggested when i bought the scanner that it would only work correctly with this cable - not true - the correct cable came witht he scanner - didn't need this at all...
1,Wrong part,"The cable was represented as fitting the cannon scanner purchased on same order, it does not. Please replace with correct type cable.R L Fisher 1255 B Mine Road, Tracy City, TN 37387.Will return wrong item at your expence, send prepaid label"
1,never got them,Postal delivery never got to me. Post office insists they delivered but I never got the package. Reported to Amazon and got credit for purchase without any hassle. Cables never showed up.
1,defective,dead on arrival - producing error messages - returned after a long search for the source of the USB port connectivity issue. Squandered many hours of precious time!
1,Unhappy Camper,The cord actually didn't work. I was going to return it but shipping was twice as much as the cord. Oh well...
2,"It works, but..........",This is just a generic cable rather than Belkin branded. There is a white computer generated sticker on the package that says Belkin but nothing on the product itself. The cable is VERY thin and inexpensive looking. Disappointed. False advertising.
4,Price commensurate with quality,Entry level product but very adequate for connecting printer to desktop computer. Good quality at a good price. Received well packed and sooner than expected.
3,USB CABLES,They came free with the printer and they are okay. They are good for normal use. I would recoommend them to use with your copier.
5,Great little cable,"I wanted a high quality USB cable at a reasonable price and I wanted it fairly quickly. That's why I looked on Amazon. The cable works fine. The price was far less that I would have paid locally. As has been my experience with Amazon, the product got here very quickly."
5,Perfectly serviciable,Hard to write a review of a cable. It is indeed 10' long. It functions perfectly. It was about a quarter of the price as the one at the big box electronic store.
5,Cable required for the printer,"This is the correct cable for the unit. It would probably be better to include the cable with the unit, as the printer would not work without it. Unlikely that anyone would have one of these lying about."
5,It is a cable. It works!,It is a cable. It works! We used it to hook up a scanner to a computer. It works! Nothing special.
2,Cable not the culprit,New Canon 3010 printer had feed problem & it's being replaced. Be sure you contact Canon directly ELSe you may get scammed with system problem BS. Do not allow TEAMVIEW function by any hardware supplier.
4,Functions fine,Haven't had it for all that long but it works as it is says on the packaging. Great length. Shipping and handling was more than the product itself.
5,Excellent cable,"This cable worked perfectly and was exactly as described.The extra length makes it especially useful when connecting my rather large printer as it enables me to keep my printer on a separate surface without straining the cable.All in all, an excellent purchase at a reasonable price."
5,Great Product - Great Service - Great Price,There's not much you can say about a USB cable. It either works or it doesn't. This one works perfectly.What is important to note is that when I went to Best Buys I saw a Belkin 6 foot cable being sold for [...] plus tax !!!The cable being sold on Amazon was 10 feet for about 5 bucks -Do the math ... Moral to the story - go to Best Buys to look and touch but do your purchasing somewhere else
5,Nice and Long,This cord is the perfect length. It connects my laptop and printer which are at two extreme ends of a desk and drawer. It does its job and is great for the price!
1,It only worked for a few weeks.,"I got wonderful and fast service. The cable worked fine at first but after a few weeks it was of no use. I am not sure what went wrong. It could be my fault, but I have never had this happen before; I've been using computers regullarly for more than 20 years."
1,Not what was intended,This item is a USB 2.0 to printer interface only. this is not a true USB 2.0/USB 2.0 device. It is poorly described.
5,It works,"Stuff like this either work or don't. And, so far, this cord has done it's its job and I have no complaints."
4,Good quality,"The one I have is a little more stylish; clear plastic for the cord, and clear/silver plastic on both ends. Good quality, and I've been using it for a couple years now"
5,10 Feet?,You wanted 12? no. you wanted 8? no. You wanted 10 feet? well THERE you have it. Belkin's solid build quality and good price.
1,Does not work with HP P1606dn,"This does not work for my HP P1606dn printer. No matter I many times I tried, my computer could not recognize the printer. Very disappointed. I guess I got what I paid for."
5,It's A USB,"What can I say, the USB was invented for plug n play and for a universal connector. This does what it was meant to do.Excellent."
5,Great value,I bought this for my printer after fainting when I found out that the same cable was $36 from my local Radio Shack. Works great with my Dell PC and HP printer.
4,Good deal,This product is a good deal - much cheaper here than at my local store. I always buy my cables at Amazon!
4,just right,This was a pretty simple purchase and it works great. Little upset that that this was the shortest they had but that is very minor. Just what I needed.
3,Ordered 3 cables at one time,1 failed out of the box and the other two work just fine.This is the second time a belkin cable has gone bad.Do yourself a favor and get a no name brand usb cable as I seem to have better luck with them.
5,No rip off here!,"I bought this cable from Amazon because the cheapest 10 ft USB cable I could buy locally (Best Buy, CompUSA, Circuit City etc) was over $25. Thank god for Amazon!"
5,Excellent,This cable is really worth the price.Its working perfectly.I using it to connect my PC to my JVC audio system.
5,Great deal!,I got a great deal on this product. Other stores were asking just under $30 for the same cable. Amazon offered the best deal after doing plenty of web searching for the best price. I am totally satisfied!!
5,Well built and the price is right,This cable is built well and works well. The price is cheap. No reason to buy the overpriced cables the retail stores want to sell you. I used this cable to connect my computer to a USB printer.
5,"Had an issue, replaced quickly and without question.","They sent me one that somehow didn't work, then I emailed them, they sent another without question and didn't ask for the old one back. Thought that was cool."
5,Great cable,This is a top quality cable for a good price. I had no problem with it. I would recommend it to anyone needing this type of cable.
5,I bought this for my printer.,This cable was designed for the connection of two electric devices between computer and printer for example. Thank you so much.
2,Poor connector fit,If I move the phone or place it wrong it doesn't charge. The connector is too loose. C c c.
3,Not needed-cable came with main product purchase,The cable was not needed as correct cable came with the scanner- very inexpensive so not worth returning- so will save for another time
3,Flip Flop,"Haven't really used it, because, it comes totally different from the pic. It's a clear cord, and through my past experience when something is different out the box other things are not far behind. So I ""Junk Drawler'd"" it. It"
5,Good buy!,I think I bought a used one for $5.84 and it worth every penny of it. I bought a shorter cable from Office Max before but the cable kept required me to reinstalled my HP Printer and it was way too pricey. It cost me almost $20 for a mere 3ft long. This is 10ft so it was so much easier to move your printer around every time you want to change your office layout.
5,BELKIN USB CABEL,"THIS IS AN AWESOME PRICE FOR THIS USB CORD. MOST OF THE MAJOR STORES WANTED $30-$40 FOR A USB CORD FOR MY NEW PRINTER. PURCHASED THIS ONE AT UNDER $6.00. WHAT A DEAL, AND IT WORKS JUST FINE.WOULD RECOMMAND THIS TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS A USB CORD."
5,Good Product,"Very good product, worked perfectly with my Brother printer! Would buy this article again if needed. Length is perfect and product looks durable."
5,Belkin USB Cables,Was able to move my printer on the other wall leaving me more room on my desk. Printer works great even from the long cable run.
4,10 Foot USB Cable,"Product arrived early and packaging was simple/efficent and not excessive. The products work as described and are the perfect length if printer is on a shelf etc. These are a tremendous value but were an ""add-on"" purchase (which means you have to buy more than 25.00 in Amazon sold products to get the incredible price)."
2,Amazon keeps asking me to review this here wire,"USB cables annoy the beejeebers out of me. You buy a printer for $40. Then you are supposed to pay another $25 for a cable to hook it up to your computer? I have heard of the ""add on sales"" model, as successfully used by Gillette to build their razor blade empire, but this is ridiculous. Particularly ridiculous as those yokels selling the printers aren't making any money on the cables (in fact, they're getting you on the printer ink).I bought my cable from amazon for $11. It isn't a great price. A great price would be $2, and that would be what a USB cable is worth. USB should be cheaper than old school 10base2 ethernet cable (which, by comparison, had better shielding, and a relatively complicated connector), but it isn't. Someone, somewhere is making a zillion dollars on USB cable, and I'd like to track him down and punch him in the throat for it."
3,Couldn't use this usb cable,"I couldn't use this cable. But it is not the fault of the cable. I ordered it to use with my new kodak printer.I installed it with a 6ft.cable then I ordered this from amazon because it is the 10ft. It would not work. Finally called Kodak and the technican said the printer wouldn't take a 10ft.We checked the cable and it was not faulty so I can't be mad about that, I will keep it and use it sometime maybe.It was a really good price.Wished I could have used it."
5,It's what I wanted,"I'm being asked to review this item by Amazon; OK; here goes. It's fine & it's what I asked for, the price was great & it arrived in a timely manner."
1,Took way too long to receive item,I will never order small items again. I could have driven across the country and picked these few items up faster. It shouldn't take 3 weeks to obtain. Never again.
2,Really CHEAP...but...,"What a deal. A 10' USB cable for .01... Wow - except for nearly 6.00 in shipping charges, and then it wasn't the same ""kind"" as what came with my ScanSnap (which I really DO like!!). If they are going to package them - they should be of the same quality, etc. Now I have a cable I don't use..."
5,Does what it says on the tin,"Exactly as described, good cable, good length, could use straight away. Good value for money."
5,Belkin Quality,I have replaced all cables in our office with Belkin cables. I have never had a problem with the quality or performance of any Belkin cable. Too bad the ratings system is limited to five stars.
5,All-around satisfactory purchase and transaction.,"As a novice to the computer world, I cannot speak for the technical aspects of the Belkin USB 2.0 Device Cable. When I determined that was what was needed to set up my newly purchased Canon printer, I was pleased to see the great price for this item offered on Amazon's site. It arrived in just a few days, as specified, and all was very satisfactory from start to finish."
1,Does Not Work,"This truly is a case of you get what you pay for. Neither my computer nor my daughter's computer could recognize the printer using this cable. This is totally worthless, but I won't return it because it would probably cost more to return it than it did to purchase it in the first place."
5,Great for the money-- beats paying twice as much at electronics store,Good product for the money-- don't go the Best Buy or Circuit City and pay twice as much for the gold-plated type.
5,Cheap and works great!,"This is a great price for such a long cable. The same cable would have cost more than 10 times as much at Comp*USA or Best Buy. I have not had a single issue with this cable in over a year, and I will be buying all of my cables from Amazon in the future."
5,Love the length!,"I purchased this cable for a ""spare""! This is now kept in my car. The length on it makes it completely useful for anyone sitting in my back seat yet needs to charge their phone. I plan on buying more."
5,Cable hookup was just easy,"Perfect, and cheap. This lets me put the scanner where I want. It was a good suggestion from the vendor. The price could not be beaten anywhere. I glad I added this to my purchase."
4,Incredibly small yet very bright,"If you are looking for something to attach to your key-chain then this is it. The package just arrived today so I've not had a chance to test reliability. Nonetheless, I was so impressed with the miniature size of this thing and how it shipped that I had to share a photo; the item is so small it actually shipped in a bubble-pack mailer! One last comment, it is unbelievably bright for such a tiny little thing..."
4,Works Almost Great on my Magnifier Visors,"The little bracket that came with this light attached to my Magnifier Visors with little modification and some epoxy. The down side is the many functions of this light, Brighter, Dimmer, Flashing fast, Flashing slow, Flashing Mores Code. I would be happier with an On-Off Button either Bright, or Brighter."
2,Disappointed,"Not bright enough, I bought the Purple beam and am very disappointed. The design is excellent and handy but the beam, even adjustable, is not bright."
2,broke quickly after a little light use,"I like the idea of this product and had high hopes it. However, after about 3 months, the first one I bought broke - the switch stopped working. Regrettably, I had already ordered 4 more and given one away, but I returned the others. Though I like the idea of the easy changing battery in this model, I might try the simpler switch model that takes removing four screws to change the battery. I took it out of the country for work, and not have had a chance to see if the company will fix it for free - even though I still have to pay about 25% of the cost for shipping. These are much more expensive than the imported ones, but I really wonder now if they are worth it."
5,SUPER LITTLE POWERHOUSE OF A LIGHT. REPLACES MY OLD BULKY ONE FOR SURE!,I am very satisfied with this great little light. Other reviewers are correct! This light puts out an awesome amount of illumination. And the continuous brightness control is nifty. I must have a mental block though. For the life of me I can't get the strobe functions to work. I MUST be doing something wrong. Maybe somebody can give SPECIFIC AND EXACT instructions on how to get it into the strobe mode and how to cycle through the modes. I'd sure appreciate it. Happy New Year to all.
3,Acceptable Keychain Light,"This light is small and unobtrusive on your keychain. The button is difficult enough to press that it doesn't easily turn on in my pocket. It has turned on and wore down the batteries a couple of times in the year that I've had it. It is plenty bright and easy to use with one hand. If you want a keychain light, I would recommend this light, for the money. Just be careful not to leave it turned on in your pocket."
4,Not Bad,"Small, lite and pretty bright for its size. It also appears to be durable. I'm getting the nano and will compare when I get it."
2,MIGHT THINK TWICE,I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE AND GAVE ONE TO MY MOM. SHE HAD IT ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND USED IT VERY LITTLE BUT THE BATTERY DIED OR EITHER IT JUST QUIT WORKING. AS MUCH AS THEY COST THEY SHOULD LAST A WHOLE LOT LONGER.
4,Great little light,"There is plenty of light output on high, and the dimming controls work well. The flashing beacon features could be useful, too. The light is so small that it's easy to block the beam with your fingers when holding it and trying to do a two-hand operation like tying a tent guyline. It's best to use the enclosed clip and fasten it to the bill of your hat. It also would serve well as a key-chain light. Replacement batteries are MUCH cheaper in bulk online; buy 10 CR2016 batteries and you have 5 replacement sets."
2,Bad Switches,"Ordered 5 of these suckers. They're compact and VERY bright. Over time, the switch on every single one of them eventually failed."
1,Junk/Scam,"I bought this item about a week ago. It just arrived in a plastic bag. I did not have time to inspect it well, I just grabed it and started using it as a normal light without trying out its functions.I told my dad about its functions and that it is waterproof and shockproof. We wander in the woods a lot so he wanted me to order 2 more.I ordered them and when they arrived for my surprise they were in their actual original packaging, with the quick release clip, the cap clip. This is when I realised the first light I got was a piece of junk, a scam. It had no brand name, no clip no functions just a simple ordinary light. The 2 new are a lot brighter, have the descibed functions and have the Photon Freedom Micro words.So for the first one I ordered I recived a low quality light, I was scamed or they shipped the wrong item..."
1,Worked great...until it died on me in less than 3 months!,Light worked really well. Would have given it 5 stars if it didn't die on me in less than 3 months. Maybe I got a bad one (or a knock-off like other reviewers mention) but I wouldn't risk buying it again.
5,"Awesome Item, vendor gouged on shipping cost","I purchased this item as a back up to one I already have...it is great if you work with your hands in low light situations where you need bright light within about 3-4 feet of your face, or as a small virtually weightless emergency light. The LED comes with a clip that fits everythig from a hat visor to sun visor in your car and is simple but highly functional.Unfortuneately, the vendor I purchased this item from (PresentsForYou) gouges you on the shipping cost...it cost as much to ship this item via regular post than the item cost me. You are not informed of this until after your purchase goes through. The shipping cost this vendor charged me was about $11, but the actual cost of shipping as printed on the package when it arrived was $4. Do the math."
1,Won't stay off,"Yes, yes, these are great lights EXCEPT they have a tendency to turn on in your pocket and then have dead batteries when you need them. The Photon II doesn't have that problem."
3,Used to go with Photon but found better alternative...,"Bottom line this one is most well known. But like others have noted, it can go off in your pocket which kills the battery and then you don't have it when you really need it. This happened to me a bunch of times and quite honestly, I didn't like the battery changing process.So, I tried this one: [...]Got to say it's way less expensive, has a well designed on/off switch..So, it hasn't let me down yet..which unfortunately, I couldn't say for the Photon.Also, I called Photon to see if any of their products can auto recall the brightness that you last set so you don't have to calibrate every single time you turn it on. The Photon rep was very nice but revealed that this feature was taken out in recent years..so, they were cutting costs....The Photon has a brighter light(I thought too bright), and the keychain attachment was better, which is less important than the poorly designed on/off functionality.Just my opinion......"
2,Not that great... Get a AAA flashlight.,Battery doesn't last long.Batteries are difficult to find and replace.It's not really that bright.Do yourself a favor and get a proper AAA battery flashligh (LD01 flashlight or similiar). I'll never carry those tiny lights again.
2,The basic light works,"The basic light works & increases/decreases in candlepower with a firm press of the single button control. All other functions such as S.O.S.; Slow Beacon; Medium Beacon; Fast Flash & use for Morse Code are non-existent.The light operates for about 10 seconds before auto turn-off. It does not operate in a sustained light mode.The ad shows it being used as an identifier with the LED keychain. As long as you were able to keep pressing the button, it could be used that way. Not convenient at all.This is in no way a miniature flashlight!"
3,"A fun idea, but overpriced","I won't downplay this light - it has a great list of features. However, if you want just as much light in the exact same package, but without any fancy programming, you can pick up very bright LED keychain lights for under a dollar. My local electronics store sells 'em by the register as an almost-free gift. The one on my keychain is a no-name brand, probably from China, and the LED is blindingly bright.--Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu"
5,Absolutely Amazing,"A fabulous collection of live, unplugged, unique versions of solid alternative rock hits from the mid nineties, recorded right here in West Michigan.I wish more music was like this. Having grown up during this period, recently listening to it brought back a load of fresh memories and nostalgia from a long-gong era of intense musical development in rock. Many tunes I haven't heard in years, and most notably never in such a form as this.Bootleg '98 is musically creative and not ""overproduced""; something hard to come by these days. If you like ""real"" music, check it out and I promise you won't be disappointed."
5,Funnnnny,If you are after laughs this will do it. I think it is funnier than 'Without a paddle.'My job is stressful and I don't need any real world drama; sometimes you just need to laugh. This is great for that!
1,Truly awful and deplorable,"Rolling Kansas is a disappointing and deplorable movie with basically no laughs or point. Friends drive around Kansas to find weed and get into misadventures. Not funny at all with some of the most stupidest teens you see in a drug movie even the stoners in Half-Baked were funnier than these dummies and the movie seems like it was shot on a home video camera because it didn't seem like a true Indie comedy and even Thomas Haden Church(Sideways)directed this mess,please don't let him direct movies in any genre. Lets hope Rip Torn,Sam Huntington,and Thomas Haden Church star in better movies than this.Overall,the worst comedy ever since Sideways and Napoleon Dynamite."
4,i wanted widescreen,"I ordered this product once before and was disappointed to see it was in fullscreen. So I ordered another copy making sure that it was the right aspect ratio, and it was damaged, and when i was sent a new one it was in fullscreen.*sigh*"
2,"I liked it better when it was called ""Fandango""","This movie was essentially a rip-off of the MUCH BETTER Fandango, which starred (seriously) Kevin Costner. The characters, the basic plot, the basic geography were all lifted from Fandango, and shamelessly so.Not since the ""Point Break"" rip-off, ""The Fast and the Furious"", have i seen such a blatant rip-off of a film.Quality-wise, it is quite weak."
1,Don't spend your money...,"I saw this movie with a friend of mine and we can't stop thinking about how poor it is... I do not understand how people can find this kind of stuff funny... Poor characters, poor plot, poor structure. IMDB give it a 6.7 out of 10, I would probably give it a big zero. At the end of the movie, my friend and me were wondering if we had to take this movie as a joke or seriously, because there is a kind of morality to all that trip, but the actors are so poor that we couldn't do the difference between joke and philosophy. Don't spend your money on that one..."
1,This video has poor instruction and bad production.,"According to the type on the box, the instructors own the Boston Kung Fu Tai Chi Institute. The men are past Martial Arts award winners and the woman is an aerobics instructor. But it appears they have never practiced together. They are not all doing the same thing at the same time, or the same way. The instructions are not clear, especially when talking about proper form, and it is difficult to ascertain proper form by observation,as they are all wearing black. There are inexplicable sudden close-ups of the instructors which also obstruct observation of the movements. This video definitely would benefit from better set lighting and direction, as well as clearer instruction."
3,Hard-Boiled in Germany,"Arjouni's hard-boiled Turkish PI Kemal Kayankaya returns for his third story, this one centered in the world of Germany's ""guest workers"" and illegal immigrants. Germany's racism is played up in this one, as Kayankaya attempts to find a missing Thai woman. As usual, his wise-assedness gets him into deeper trouble than he really needs. There is a subplot with his best friend, Slibusky, which is a little hard to follow, but for the most part it's the smart, quick, read I've come to expect from Arjouni."
4,The U.S.S. Oklahoma during the Pearl Harbor raid.,"The author-Stephen Bower Young-served as a gunner on one of the main turrets of the battleship U.S.S. Oklahoma. He was aboard the ship when she was torpeodoed during the surprise Japanese attack. This story is about his personal experiences during the December 7, 1941 attack and the escape from the ship when it rolled over.Young offers recollections about the life aboard the battleship and the sailors he served with. Many of these sailors would not survive the attack (448 died).The majority of the book was about the attack and the subsequent escape. I was most interested in Young's successful escape, when other sailors drilled holes into the bottom of the ship so those trapped could escape. A most interesting read."
5,Wonderful book,"I was captivated by the realness in the writing, felt like I was there. Of course my interest was intensified because one of the characters in the book is my uncle, John Gercevic. The writer captured the terrible events of this day and brings you into the book. Highly recommend."
1,Pathetic Publication,"This so-called book was produced by robotically scanning the pages of an original and having a computer perform optical character recognition. All original formatting was lost. Photo captions (no photos in this ""book"") are co-mingled into the resulting ""text"" wherever they might have occurred. Page boundaries were lost. Leading letters in paragraphs lost. Punctuation is haphazard. The publisher, General Books, should be ashamed of their miserable excuse for what they call literature."
5,One of the most interesting books I have read on Picasso.,"(.....please take note that due to legal constraints, there was no public tie made between this book and the movie ""Surviving Picasso"" starring Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore - I just wanted to give you all a little footnote here, because that movie *is* this book, virtually scene by scene, and almost word for word....and they did a fantastic job.)This is a beautifully articulate book. I have read it four times. If you have interest in the mentality of Pablo Picasso, this book is one of a handful which you should take the time out to consume. It goes without saying that being written by an ex-lover there is some bias involved.I'm not so much a fan of the man's work, but I have always been fascinated with his psyche.Francoise Gilot is a very dynamic and insightful person and her work is as interesting to appreciate as her writing."
1,Don't order this book!,"This book is some type of rough draft manuscript. It cites pictures, but there are none. The French accents did not type correctly which makes this book illegible."
4,Picasso,I needed to get this for my art class and it helped me a lot to understand the life of picasso
3,Twilightzone-esque,"""Final"" was intriguing enough to keep me interested the entire time. I wanted to give it like 3 and a half stars because it's not quite a 4 star movie, but better than a 3 star movie. There is a great twist in the film (which I love) but the very end was a bit predictable. However, it didn't ruin the movie for me. I'm not sure I would classify this as sci-fi. It's more of a mystery/semi-thriller. It reminded me of the old Twilight Zones a little or The Outer Limits tv show a lot. If you are looking for spaceships, robots, high tech machines ... this movie doesn't have any of that. But it does have some pretty good acting, an interesting plot and a winding story line that will keep you guessing til the very end. There are a lot of bad movies out there today... I wouldn't consider this one of them."
3,It looks like an overlong episode of The outer limits,"Cheap production,weird story, good atmosphere and two competent actorsin a film wich should last no more than 70 minutes. A man who wakes up in a strange place not knowingwho and where he is surely is a cliche, but here the cliche becomes intriguing.The movie has three distinct parts. the first one,when the viewer, probably a sci-fi fan like me, thinks he has just made a mistake watching it, because really it does not look a scifi movie. The second part, where the viewer gets caught in a mysterious situation(is the guy really in the future?Is this really a worls devastated by a plague?Are the guys in the hospitalsome kind of survivors?)and knows this IS a good scifi plot. The third partwith the surreal ending confuses the viewer...is it or is not a scifi movie? Watch it and decide...It should have been made in black and white, in less than 70 minutes.It would be a very good episode of the original The outer limits..."
3,Could Have Been Better,"This film has an interesting premise that doesn't quite live up to its potential. Leary's character, Bill Tyler, is confined in a psychiatric hospital, where he is being evaluated by Dr. Ann Johnson (Hope Davis). Most of the film involves Ann's sessions with Bill, where his claims of being cryogenically frozen for 400 years are interspersed with memories of his past. It all moves along pretty slowly at first, and can be a little confusing, leaving you wondering where it is ultimately headed. Eventually, the truth about Bill is revealed fairly quickly.The end of the film is somewhat unsatisfying and leaves a lot of questions unresolved. Unfortunately, the DVD lacks any special features, such as commentary, that may lend insight into some of these unanswered questions. Overall, it is not a bad film, and in hindsight will probably be more enjoyable the second or third time around."
2,Is it Over Yet,I bought this movie because of its four star reviews - but found myself tempted to fast forward halfway through and end the slow slow storyline and low budget misery. If you see it on TV watch it - but don't waste your money on a dvd.
4,"Very good, but not great...","Ahhh, Bivouac. Another creation and casualty of the mid-90s ""alternative"" boom and subsequent bust. While British, Bivouac's lyrics are the only thing that make them distinguishable from an American alt-rock band circa 1995. ""Not Going Back There Again"" and ""Mainbrake"" sound a bit Husker Dü, but then there's the jammier ""Gecko or Skink"" and the loud-soft-loud ""Thinking"" and ""Trepanning"" and they go all grunge on you. If you like the recent digitization of rock, you won't like this album very much, as it's very much a product of its time. But it's a good product."
5,OMG!,"Adorable! I used to want them, and mow my friend does. I love this creative addition to the princess collection. Overall, these are great dolls.Yes, they should make kirstie and kaycee dolls. And Burgdine.becky"
3,This product is great...if you buy it in stores.,"I'm a woman with seb dermatitis of the scalp and this product not only softens my hair, but it feels great on my scalp, when I have inflamation. I swear by this conditioner; however, the product that I purchased in the store was a lot thicker and aromatic than what I'd ordered with this company. I would give this product a 6 out five stars if I purchased it from the store."
4,happy customer,Very happy with my CD. Didn't think I could ever find it. Thanks for your prompt service.
1,Thanks for the tip..I was just going to hit the purchase button and decided to read your review.,Sorry for what you are going through with that printer..What a relief I saw your review and didn't make the sam mistake of purchasing one..Thank You So So much.
4,The Real Story of the Black Sheep Squadron,"Having watched the TV Show ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" it was interesting to find out that the true story of VMF-214 was almost completly different to what was protrayed on the TV Show. The only compliant I have, is with the editing of this documentary, as it was obviously made for TV, so the documentary would stop and start for commercial breaks."
3,Not as great as I thought it would be,"I love Tim Lahaye and have read all of the Left Behind series, so I was very excited to read this book. But for some reason it didn't help me as much as I thought it would. I found it slightly confusing because Lahaye presents about 5 diffrent ways to study the Bible, but the chapter on tools for study where he included his recomendations was helpful. I have recently ordered ""How to Study the Bible"" by Kay Arthur and hope that it will give me a little more direction and explanation. I hope that this review helped."
4,Good Bible study tool,"Not only does this book give guidance and suggestions for 'how' to study the Bible, but it gives scriptures passages to support, and also writing space for your own notes and what you've learned. (workbook style)I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to improve their Bible knowledge by getting into The Word."
5,Great resource for new Christians and for any Christian who wants to start digging into the Word,"A great little book that I wish I'd read 25 to 35 years ago. I learned some of what the author suggests the hard way - over time and by trial and error. Nevertheless, I did find some valuable new tips and reference suggestions to make Bible study more meaningful. I highly recommend this book to any Christian who is serious about wanting to get to know God's word."
1,Many errors in both the book and the CD,"After reading the first few sections of the book, I abandoned it for more accurate resources due to the sheer number of factual and typographical errors I had found. The CD-based quiz also contained many errors--including test questions where interpretation of an EKG was required, but an image of an X-ray was shown, or vice versa. Out of 8 image interpretation questions, I counted only one where the picture matched the question stem and choices. Also, many of the ""explanation"" windows for the test questions did not really address why each choice was right or wrong, but just added another piece of trivia about the disorder. I feel the editing of both the book and CD need work, and the explanations for the answers should be more detailed. At most, this item could be used as an outline for study, while using other sources to check facts."
1,Really?,"A pretty good book that I mostly enjoyed until the ending. It completely ruined it for me. I wanted to shake the author and ask what the heck she was thinking! If she was trying to display the effects of teenage dating, then she did so terribly. What a waste of paper."
3,"Great book, BAD ENDING!!!","Okay, I would like to talk to the author and ask her what the deal was? When I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. VERY interesting! Loved the story! Could relate. Loved Josie and the way she could be cool when talking to guys. Loved the use of ""You, maybe"". That was PRICELESS!! I could never do that! That was so funny. I wish I had the courage to be like that in high school. (I'm 26 now.) Anyway, I really loved reading the book, but I HAVE to say, it's really bugging me. It ended really bad. The book just needs 1 more chapter. I was sooo hoping for Josie to end up with Michael and it would have a wonderful happy ending. I can't believe it ended the way it did. There needs to be a sequal. But then again, it really only needs one more chapter I think, not a whole other book. I'd like to know what the author was thinking in not having a good ending. Real life is too dissapointing as it is, books need to have wonderful happy endings."
5,"beautiful set, great detail, fun to play with","We bought this and the donkey and lamb. What a beautiful and unbreakable set! My children (ages 12-7), have been playing with it for hours! The detail is so nice for an unbreakable set, and it looks ""real"". This was worth the money, and I highly recommend it to anyone."
2,a Bit Disappointed,"I received this as a gift first of all. Surprised and tickled. Then I looked at it closely, and was disappointed that even though it's nearly kid friendly, small parts are not good for wee ones. There is nothing but the human figures, no angels, no animals, no star, no fun. I wasn't impress with the MADE in CHINA either."
5,Great Interview,"Tiger Woods is the Greatest Golfer Ever&One of the Greatest Athletes Ever period. he has already left a lasting impression. this Interview has Tiger speaking on the Impact of His Father who passed within the past year. He talks about his Mother who didn't play that ""Time Out"" mess. Tiger's Mom was from the Old School. Tiger reflected on his Greatness on the Golf Course&also given back to the community&striving to help the youth. Tiger Woods is Cool a Brother. he keeps to himself&just does his job.Ed Bradley does a Great Job as always. Ed Bradley Is one of the Greatest Interviewers Ever. he has a vibe about him that is direct&Candid,but also he has that Down home folk vibe."
2,Cheesy,A cheesy product. This was not the quality I expected. I was hoping for something a bit nicer. Yes it wasinexpensive.
2,Great while it lasted...,"I loved this bag for the few weeks it lasted. The shoulder strap is attached to the bag really flimsily, though, so it didn't take long for it to break. Now it sits in my closet. I wish it had been more durable."
3,Not what I expected...,"Even though I've decided to keep it, this bag doesn't have any small compartments, only big ones. Would've liked to have some smaller compartments (inside one of the large compartments) for smaller items. I've since found a smaller zippered case I can slip inside one of the large compartments for my smaller items. Shoulder strap is feminine (like what you would find on a woman's purse), need to find a wider more masculine shoulder strap, preferably leather (like the bag) or possibly webbed, with a shoulder pad. The leather used in this bag is not what you might expect looking at the pictures provided. I would venture to guess those pictures are older, probably from back when the bag was made from ""soft full grain cowhide leather"". This leather is pebbled and feels cheap. It's not bad for the price, I'm not sorry I bought it, but I was expecting better. -kd5-"
2,"Ok Bag, wont fit an Ipad","Bag is ok, nice leather but super small. Don't expect to carry a Ipad in it as I had wished when I bought it. Key, Phone, change..... that's about it. Little expensive for a bag this size."
3,"Roomy enough, but not the best quality","Even though this is the man bag, I bought it for myself. It looks very nice, though it's a big wide so it tends to stick out from my body a lot. In fact, I don't use the cell phone holder because that makes it even wider. The other problem was that one of the clasps on the shoulder strap wouldn't stay shut so I super-glued it. Problem solved, or so I thought until the whole clasp broke. I ended up replacing both the clasps with small keychain rings. Not super classy but it works. Other than that, the bag works well. Nice leather and room enough for a wallet, phone, mini ipod, some make-up. Just the basics."
2,Exactly what I wanted except for poor quality.,"The bag is the perfect size, lightweight and in general looks nice. However, the bag I received had some shiny glue-like stuff on it especially around the metal parts. I got a little of it off, but in one place it turned green when I tried to wipe it off, in another place the leather crumbled. It was all a little too much to pass off as 'weathering'. I emailed the seller and did not get a response so I decided to return it and not order another. The refund was processed without question."
3,exactly like the OEM battery,"This battery is exactly like the OEM battery. Lasts for about 3 hours on a fresh charge, 2.5 hours if it's been sitting for a week. No problems.My only complaint is really just a nitpick. This DVD player has been out for a long time. Battery technology has improved over the years so it would be nice if they came up with a battery of the same size & shape with a higher capacity."
3,A little pricey for the quality,"This case is compact and designed specifically for the Canon 300D Digital Rebel. It was easy to attach and fit, however there is no room for anything but the camera and the attached lens. You will need another bag to hold any other accessories like lenses, memory cards, cleaning kits, etc. It's perfect for the ""throw over the shoulder and go"" type of situation. The look and feel is not what I expected, and has a ""cheap"" look to it. In my opinion, this item is overpriced for what you get."
4,Of course it's great; it's Todd!,"I had this on tape when it came out, but purchased it on CD so I could listen to it more frequently. I still love it."
3,Good,"I have had a quick listen to this cd, but still waiting for my copy to turn up. So far I have liked what I've heard of most of the tracks. To tell you the truth, I wanted this cd mainly for the Espresso track. I've heard the whole song and seen it on You Tube and fell in love with it. I know when I do get to hear all the songs properly, I will thoroughly enjoy it, as Todd is a genius in pretty much everything he does and he'll probably still be punching out great music in his 70's, 80's and 90's even.Cathy"
3,Not a stranger.,"I just baught this tape to have the episode [Showdown] very hard to get anywhere else.The title, [THE STRANGER] is not what is on this video. It's [DEATH AT DAWN]I don't know why the company made this mistake I guess only they know, though very much missleading...these are good episodes.Taped in sp and in stereo.Sound is fine and the picture is good, worth the money."
5,good value,"This book is definitely worth buying if you are interested in the space shuttle. The photography is amazing, and lets you in on all kinds of fascinating behind the scenes details of shuttle operations. It contains informative captions and lot's of stunning photography. I bought this while at Kennedy space center and it is my favorite souvenir."
5,very light weight,"I bought these earrings for myself as a birthday gift and was amazed at how light weight they were. I like the twisted look, gives it a little more stunning look than just plain silver hoops.I wear these earrings a lot with many different colors - black, blue, purple, grey, teal. Very versatile, not big, just enough to see the twist."
1,Sturrock translation is awful,"This latest translation of Proust's ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" may be more accurate or ""truthful"", but the reading experience is in my opinion wooden and stilted.Moncreiff's original translation lends much more of a roll and lyrical quality to the writing and it makes for a much more satisfying experience. I can't speak for the other Penguin editions, but this volume was a huge disappointment such that I had had enough of it after the first 100 pages and went out and bought an older edition.The five star reviews on here are very misleading as the majority are for the Modern Library edition. I suggest that it is these and other Moncreiff editions that should be sought out."
1,Just don't...,"Well, to be honest - these guys are trying to hoodwink you. I ordered a product that was supposed to be a six-volume box set totaling over three thousand pages. I got the fourth volume - only the fourth volume - and no explanation. You should definitely not buy this book from this supplier."
5,"In Vol. 4, the narrator becomes frank about sexualitity.","In this, the fourth volume of Proust's ""In Search of Lost Time"" (a.k.a. ""Remembrance of Things Past""), the narrator is suddenly exposed to a new level of worldly knowledge, a knowledge that the previous volumes foreshadowed but never openly discussed. The volume begins at the apex of society, more or less where the previous volume ends (i.e., a reception at one of the fashionable Guermantes). We are then taken on a somewhat bumpy ride down from that peak, to the lesser salon of the Verdurins (previously seen through Swann's eyes in vol. 1) and the narrator's less-than-admirable conduct toward Albertine. Along the way, as the narrator becomes more of an actor in, and less of an observer of, the world, Proust's style likewise becomes, at times, more traditionally novelistic. Yet it retains the unique insight, precision, and vitality that make reading Proust a life-changing experience."
4,A view of Human Vanity,"The central figure in this volume is the Baron de Charlus. Everybody else seems to me to be relative to him. His homosexiality is a passion that is not only sexual, but also intellectual and seems to run parallel to the disintegration of this society he loves so much. I never have read a believable description of a character of such arrogance and vanity, yet posessed of such human frailty. A very disquietening classic."
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This toy is awful! The line you draw with the stylus included on the screen is blurry and not straight. Even when you use the ""straight line tool"" the lines aren't straight! Don't be fooled by the fun adds and T.V., this produuct stinks!Unless you are 4 or under, you'll use this once and forget it. Trust me on this, don't waste your time or money."
4,My kids love it!,"I bought this toy for my daughter for xmas, she is 6, she has played with it everyday, and my 4 year old son likes it also. My only complaint is the volume, I can't figure out how to turn it down. Otherwise, my kids love it!"
2,Just got this free and we will be giving it away.,"Granted, it is 7 years old and is a digital dinosaur. So there's that. I bet in its prime it was something novel. Thank goodness for affordable DSs and those Leapsters. Whew."
1,Not Durable!,"My daughter got this for Christmas and was so excited. Three days later it got knocked off the table accidently by ME (the mom), onto a carpeted floor and cracked the screen. It wouldn't work after that. Why would they make a CHILD'S toy so fragile? Eighty dollars wasted & a very unhappy little girl!"
1,The Oversoul Song,"Please ignore the rating, but if you listen to the sample the song ""Nothing Like Tomorrow"" and really like it, or if you have the CD and really like that song check out the band ""Supreme Beings of Leisure"" because it sounds like it is them under a different name. Their debut is self-titled and pretty good. In fact a different version of ""Nothin' like Tomorrow"" appears on it. I don't think they sound at all like Portishead-- Much more upbeat."
2,Even More Games,"Like a Rocky sequel, this book doesn't get it. It would be useful with children and young adults, but I could not use it with high functioning adults. Had I not been in a hurry, and had reviewed the book, I would not have purchased it."
5,Excellent services and fast delivery,"The product is in the original package, it looks decent (Since I am going to send it to my brother in China, I haven't open the package). The service is excellent!"
1,No in-depth User Manual,"Acid Pro 4.0 has a lot of functionality and I have enjoyed using what little portions of it I can. However, I give the product 1 star because it does not come with an adequate user's manual. It has an extremely light weight 10 page ""guide"" that isn't worth the paper it's written on. There was a huge user manual published but Sony has discontinued it, and I can't seem to find one. If you've already used the program, you'll be ok. Otherwise, stick with Acid, the non-pro version. Having all the functionality and not being able to harness it stinks. :("
3,Cape and Fangs Caper,"This cute animal fantasy is a quick and easy read, filled with lots of dialogue and amusing family dynamics. Harold, thekind-hearted canine narrator, faithfully relates the bizarre events following the introduction of a black and white rabbit into a family of two pre-teen boys. Book-educated Chester, the wise cat, however, is immediately suspicious of the new pet, whose name tag was written in a Carpathian dialect. Easy-going Harold tries to befriend the little fellow, yet even he has to admit that there are some odd stunts happening after dark.Are humans slower to ""catch on"" than the four-pawed world? Are the authors making a not-so-subtle-plea for nutritious doggy snacks and humane bunny care? If you recall the self-analysiscraze of the 70's, you'll chuckle at this spoof of America's mania to get-in-touch-with-your-inner-self near the end of the book. Go, Dr. Crazy Cats! This is for kids of all ages--Dracula lite!"
2,"Great on Stage, But in the Studio?","Hearing just a few bars of the title track, ""The Book of Love,"" by accident on Pandora, I was so struck that I ordered the CD right away.It was just a flash in the pan. I'm taken aback that Ms. Bentyne, a perenially exciting performer on Heart's Desire, Foreign Affair, Spies in the Night, et al., seems so uninspired on this solo disc. She brings nothing new to these standards. Nor is her concept, presenting the stages of a love affair as a song cycle, new. It was done far more convincingly by Streisand two decades earlier in Till I Loved You.Even the haunting title track turned out to be less than meets the ear. Its lyrics are not only inane -- Cole Porter, who is represented on this CD, would chortle -- they don't even sync with the melody. Its arrangers have plagiarized note-for-note the opening to the Singers Unlimited version of When I Fall in Love."
2,ATTENTION AU BOURDON !,"La lumineuse et très belle voix de Cheryl ne parvient pas à me faire écouter ce disque ennuyeux et convenu ; on se croit à la fin des années 50 dans une sorte de film obscur ; célèbre pour ses vocalises acrobatiques dans sa formation d'origine ""Manahatan transfer"", c'est ici une suite de complaintes un peu tatasses et nunuches -, pour les amateurs d'émotions faciles et génériques. Dommage, l'artiste mérite mieux et plus d'épanouissement que de chanter la 1001 ème version de ""cry me a river"" ! Absurde et totalement décalé. Bref : le vol du bourdon !"
2,Britney has a lot to learn,"Overall, Britney puts on a good show. However, compared to veterans like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Janet Jackson, she still has a lot to learn about performance and stage presence. There was also a lot of lag time and unnecesary sequences. It's okay, she has time......"
3,Britney in Vegas,"Britney performs her hits and then some at Las Vegas, and the experience is somewhat uplifting. She sings: ""Oops!...I Did It Again"", ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"", ""Overprotected"", ""Born To Make You Happy/Lucky/Sometimes"", ""Boys"", ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"", ""I Love Rock 'N' Roll"", ""What It's Like To Be Me"", ""Lonely"", ""Don't let Me Be The Last To Know"", ""Anticipating"", ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", and ""...Baby One More Time""."
5,A Great One!!,I just got not the DVD but the video and I think that it is great and she is the best dancer ever and singer and soooo pretty!I highly recemmond you to get this Britney Spears Live From Las Vegas is great!!
4,Big show! Lots of lights and dancing and production!,"I liked this concert of Britney Spears better than the one-hour special she did on FOX. It was a big, massive production, loads of lights and a lot of dancing and choreography! She did a lot of costume changes. She did a lot of songs from her three albums. The show starts off with a dream, then builds up in momentum. Spears does lip-sync on a few songs, but I happened to hear her band more than the record she was lip-synching over. That concert proved that Britney is a dynamic performer and entertainer. I hope they make a concert DVD of the Onyx Hotel tour that she did in the spring of this year. The Las Vegas element is why this concert is full of the excess and the big lights circling and swinging all across that stage."
2,Quite Disappointed Actually,"Ok, this is a LIVE concert on DVD. In a huge arena. And...SHE MIMED THE ENTIRE THING.Thousands of people are spending quality time and money to see Britney Spears perform. We need to hear her ACTUAL SINGING voice.NOT a CD version that everyone has heard 100 times.I knew Britney was going to mime, but I didn't expect her to mime THE ENTIRE THING.She is good at dancing though. If she doesn't want to get so puffed out on stage I suggest that she should quit smoking.The dance moves and stage props and the whole set up was really good, but if there's one thing I expect out of concerts it is the SINGING."
2,sad,"i like britney,but i feel sad when i see the show,britney don't sing any one song(only playback),she have a lot to learn from others singers like madonna,madonnas show's are always live,madonna can fly and sing at the same time,thats great."
4,britney las vegas,"this dvd has great sound,great behind britney spears new clip boys her mum talks for 15 mins and also her friends , family, bodyguards.she also talk about japan,france,india,scotland.4 stars is good and i give it 4 stars not quite 5 though this dvd goes for 1 hour 55minsthere isn't any bad language on this dvd so kids enjoy a show you'll never forgetBritneys back and pumping up with heatshe sings her new song Boys,Somtimes a new song In your hearts Dreams, Crazy, Slave For You and more. on the dvd there is a kareokie special you can sing along to your best songs 9 to choose from."
1,Buy it if you like strippers,"If you want a DVD of a wannabe stripper lip synching...then this is the DVD for you!!!I mean, I can get the same thing on HBO or even in person at the Spearment Rhino. C'mon people. How can you call this talent? Christina Aguilera might be a hoe, but at least she can SING!"
1,Skank in a Elvis suit.,"Ok so yeah white, blonde trailer trash is hot...but only if she could sing. There is only one King Of Rock N Roll and that is Elvis Presley, get that suit of this trash bag ho before she insults his legacy just by wearing it. Britney Spears is a manufactured, no talent, hack, Elvis is The King there is a huge difference and why he got to wear his trademark suit. Britney is nothing and this is an insult to Elvis, britney would maybe qualify as one of the King's groupies maybe.....thats as far as it goes."
1,Give it up Brit!!! You can't Sing!!,"have you heard her sing live? she sounds like a chipmunk...and that's if she EVER sings live...if you want to see a real show with real talent I suggest Madonna... The Drowned World Tour, Re-invention Tour, or any of her other tours!! Madonna Rocks! Britney Sux!"
1,EXACTLY WHERE SHE BELONGS,"Las Vegas, the elephant's graveyard for untalented singers. The place that made Wayne Newton a STAR!! Britney definitely belongs in Las Vegas where she can get her next quickie marriage and try to belt out a song to the old drunks. A perfect audience for the woman who can't carry a note."
2,This isn't good...,"Okay I saw the concert. And I wasn't impressed. The whole presentation was confusing and didn't make sense. I wish she had better direction and guidance because every performance was weak and watered down. But then again I am spoiled. I have been to countless concerts (madonna, janet jackson, shakira, etc). and I have never seen a concert so poorely done. No wait, there was vanilla ice. But besides that for an artist who is suppose to be a pop princess, she isn't showing it.I really did expect a lot more from her than this."
3,Not as good as expected but ok,"I had mixed feelings after viewing Britney Spears' Live from Las Vegas! HBO concert special. First off, there was hardly any amazing choreography for this show, something that Spears usually has a plethora of. Second, her rendition of her ballady single ""Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know"" sounded a little too deep, low, and Toni Braxton-like for my liking (let alone unnatural for Britney - did the microphone not process her voice right?). Third of all, the effects --though amazing in scale-- could confuse as easily as the questioning over Britney's ""assetts."" Britney's touching tribute to our nation's armed forces did add a tish of realness to the typically-fabricated Miss Spears. Overall, a good but not amazing show."
4,What can I say........ I love a Vegas show!!!!!,"This is where Britney and Las Vegas meet and its a full on show!!!Great stuff, plenty of punch and besides all that, my 2 and a half year old boy loves it!!You won't be disappointed with the show."
2,"Yes, she's The Queen Of Lip-Sync","Ok, Is she a singer or what? ""Live From Las Vegas"" should be renamed ""Lip-Sync From Las Vegas"". This is a Concert, a MUSICAL, therefore you should be singing. I gave 2 stars because I have to admit it, she's hot all wet and there were a few FEW good acts... 3 is many."
5,Love It!,"This concert was amazing! It is so much fun to watch and listen to, the remixes are great, the performances are breath-taking and it was is an overall great DVD! You should definately get this!*DJ"
3,ok,"I would give her more stars if she really sang, all she did was lip sync. And the last part of the concert was a total strip tease. Britney and company should have more taste since Kiddies are at her concert."
2,This is very frustrating,I wish someone would take all the music videos for all these songs and put them on a DVD. Can anybody tell me why no one has done this yet?!
1,Very disappointing show,"I bought this DVD after hearing the top hits from Britney. I think the songs rock. But that's about all. I was ulterly disappointed with the performance from Britney. Let's face it, Britney cant dance. There is *no* rhythm in her steps and all her movement could be described with just one word - rookie. I'm not a dancer, nor a talented star. But I sure can tell you that Britney was simply too clumsy in all her moves. I dont know who was her choreographer, but I do suggest that they see how other top stars perform, like MJ. I watched this on a Saturday afternoon, and for the record, I fast forward 30% of this DVD adn still fell asleep towards the end!! If you're drawn towards britney's songs, I suggest you to stay as it is. Dont look at how she dance nor any of her performance in this DVD. I dont know about the rest of her other DVD, but this DVD of mine is gonna be out in ebay today."
1,What a disappointment!!!!,"I borrowed this DVD to check out the performance (because I already knew she CAN'T sing) and it was a huge disappointment, I was expecting at least good choreographies and a good show, since she never sings, but what I saw was soooooo sad, I've seen her performances on MTV and her videos and those were really well prepared and very well organized (with some great choreographies), but this presentation in Vegas was too sad, the outfits were horrible too, but that doesn't surprise me she always dresses really bad (despite all the money she has). Finally, the sound is VERY GOOD, BUT the tracks that were used on the concert were the same tracks from her album, so if you want to hear her songs then buy the CD, don't spend more money on the DVD is not worth it, at least they should have made a good mix for the concert, not putting the same tracks for her to lipsync."
5,Amazing!,"Wow! This is what concert DVD""s should always be like. This is great concert. The dancing, the stage, the outfits are great! The concer includes these songs:Oops! I Did It Again!, You Drive Me Crazy, Overprotected, Born To Make You Happy, Lucky, Sometimes, Boys, Stronger, I""m Not A girl Not Yet A Woman, I Love Rock""n""Roll, What""s It Like To Be Me, Lonely, Don""t Let Me Be The Last To Know, Anticipiating, I""m A Slave For You and Baby One More Time. There are also bonus videos and a movie trailer. Great!"
3,Lipsyncing in concert.,Nice production visually. Almost all the songs are lipsynced on this DVD. Some distastefully obvious. Britney performs her best striptease dance routines and displays enough cleavage for everyone.
1,Bad. Very Bad.,"This would have to be the worst performance I have seen in a very long time. Britney lip-synced almost every song. Her tired dance moves echoed Madonna and Janet Jackson's early 90's performances.It has been clear to many for a long time that Britney does not have a very strong voice and it is proven here. The songs also seem to all be part of medleys (performed mostly at under 3 minutes). Too much time and money is spent on costumes and set. Basiaclly it's a live music video. Also can't help but be a little confused by the whole 12 year old girl thing for one song and then the grown up wannabe madonna for the next???The show is cheap. The DVD quality is very good. Britney is very bad live (even with pre-recorded vocals) and all the songs seem to have the same beat, same sounds and same formula ( intro / verse / chourus / verse / chourus / bridge-verse / altered chourus / chourus with ad lib / end ..."
1,"It's Alright, but I Wasn't Impressed","Britney Spears' ""Live from Las Vegas"" is a true spectacle. Yes, Britney wows the audience with her dancing, special effects, and filmed sequences, but these are all things I've seen before in many, many shows. Britney does serve her purpose for going out there and putting on a big show, but hearing the backing tracks that play on her CDs in the background and her lipsynching is not very interesting. After a while you get tired of it. Then comes the ballad and Britney tries her hardest to make the audience believe that she is a real singer, but it comes off very forced and almost painful (I'm going by her facial expressions as she sings). I'm not trying to bash Britney Spears, but writhing around on the floor soaking wet is not my idea of a great show - we've seen all of this before from her and others, so it's nothing new and exciting. Like another reviewer stated, ""She has a lot to learn."""
2,A performer should really sing at a concert,"Saw this one on HBO. The lip syncing was not very good, either just get out there and dance to the recordings, or really sing. Don't try to fake it."
3,Take it Or Leave It,Im a huge Britney fan but I honestly have to say she didnt throw in any extras for the money you spent. Seriously if you know someone who has HBO just tape it. I spent the cash assuming it would be like OTOWN where they at least say thanks for buying the video and show them a lil backstage but it wasnt. Being a Britt fan if you saw the show you already have seen the tape.Its ok if your obsessed but if you dont throw money away dont buy it.
2,Dissapointing...,"I usually love HBO concerts and I did enjoy parts of Britney's Vegas concert because some of the songs had great choreographed performances. The choreographer did a good job, but that doesn't say much about Britney. She has great stage presence and is very appealing on the eyes but it was very dissapointing to listen to a pre-recorded track. I thought Britney LIVE meant we would actually hear her singing LIVE but that wasn't the case, and it really took a toll on the quality of the show."
3,"Not as good, as the Hawaii performance","I dont know, i dind't like this performance at all. The thing is that she tried being too ""sexy"" and it limit her as an artist. She was lipsyncing the whole time, If i wanted to hear her sing like that, i would just put her cd on and listened to it . Also what's up with the weird costumes and the walking around? She use to dance in unison with her dancers instead of standing around feeling on herself. Big disappointment!"
3,Not so great show,I really like Britney but I must confess that this is not her best show. Even the audience showed lack of entusiasm during the performance.
5,Excellent,One of the best Britney's tour.. nothing compared with the onyx hotel tour...i love all the performances
5,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is THE BEST CONCERT OF ALL TIME!!!! she puts on the best show.. you don't need to be a britney fan to appreciate this spectacle! Its got fireworks, rain, fire, lights an amzing HUGE stage setup. the costumes are amazing, the dancing is WOW!!! This shows what britney is best at she is a born entertainer! What i also loved about it was that she remixed her older songs such as baby one more time, oops i did it again and made them much more enjoyable and they WENT OFF!!!! She has lots of energy and LOOKS HOT!! Her choreography is incredible and shows you what britney is really about!! Also inbetween the songs she has the background dancers dance along to club music which also adds to the energy of the show!!!I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this DVD to anyone who wants an uptempo, high energy, highly produced concert to watch. It is a MUST HAVE!!!!"
2,Thin /= quality,"I know what you're up too. You're looking for a mousepad made for optic mice. Well, the sad truth is that you'll never really get much better than a cheap foam surface pad, or maybe just the surface of your desk.What makes the heavy soft pads better than this one supposedly made specifically for optic mice, is that the weight of the pad keeps it firmly in place. This pad is skinny and shifts on your desk frequently. This is not favorable for any application, particularly gaming. Also, the pad tends to warp and become uneven. Pads with grooves in them will cause misreadings in the optics sensors causing your pointer to skip around the screen.Trust me, cheap, 3 dollar pads are better than this."
2,A flimsy disappointment,"So many have said they love this pad, I must start by saying my complaints might be unique to my set-up. So, on to my gripes:1) I expected the pad to be much more substantial than it is, it's very flimsy... really thin and flexible, and easily scratched and bent; this really upset me, since I had chosen this pad over another pad which had a sturdy metal back suitable for holding in my lap; and2) I have a Logitech Lasermouse which never gave me any trouble until I started using this pad, but now, with this pad, my mouse-pointer has a tendency to jump or skip all over the screen like crazy at times... I've checked, and the cause isn't a dirty mouse, so I don't know why it acts up only part of the time.The bottom line, at least for me, is I wish I hadn't bought this pad... it's pretty though."
4,Satisfied,"Really pretty, works as expected. Only downside is if you're picky about things looking neat- surface tends to get scratched easily."
5,The real deal!!,I just got my Hearthkit and couldn't wait to try it. I whipped up a couple of batches of pizza dough and and set up my hearthkit while it was proofing. Well as they said it took less than 1 minute to assemble the thing. Couldn't be easier. They tell you in the video that it takes about 30 minutes to preheat the item. In actual fact it took almost 1 hour. No big deal except my pizza was assembled and waiting and got soggy by the time the oven was ready. I highly suggest getting a pizza peel if you plan on using this for pizza. Getting it in the oven was the most difficult thing about the whole operation. We kind of threw it in and it got a little (make that alot) mushed but it came out with a thin and crispy crust as good as any I've ever had. I can't wait to try bread and roast chicken!!
1,19 inch HearthKit Is Discontinued,"I haven't used the Hearthkit, although I've ordered it from many suppliers - all of whom are waiting for stock.I finally phoned the manufacturer and was told that the 19"" size was discontinued long ago. Apparently, Hearthkit does not believe in letting its distributors know that the 19"" kit is a thing of the past, so orders just keep piling up, and folks are getting angry at their retailers, when in truth, Hearthkit has failed to communicate.If you're lucky enough to be able to use the larger size stone, its still available. This may be a great product, but the company could certainly use some common sense. I wonder how many orders are laying around at Amazon for the 19"" unit, waiting to be fulfilled. Pretty stupid of HearthKit, huh?"
1,"Amazon not in the ""loop""","We ordered this item on April 16, 2005, and to date, no insert. Amazon, when asked about the delay, gave us the equivalent of an ""electronic"" shrug of their mighty shoulders and offered to ship it next day (Thanksgiving?) When we pressed them to contact the vendor (seemed logical) we were met with nothing, no useful response. Everyone we have talked to that has used the insert is enthused, wish we could say the same about Amazon (at least in this case) Have seen the item in retail stores at the same price, so that might be a better choice."
2,"Comfortable, handsome, but not so functional","Headset is comfortable and secure, and the sound received is excellent. However, many people I spoke to on the phone told me I sounded soft and far away - a condition that immediately went away when I removed the headset and spoke directly into the phone. Sadly, this did not work - I need people to hear me when I talk on the phone during meetings."
4,Great for the price if you use it,The volume is more than enough. Comfort is not annoying only if pressed into your ear does it become bothersome otherwise it sits on your ear nicely.My only complaint would be that I wish the cord was longer. I use this with two phone (on two separate lines). While using it on a cordless phone it is not an issue. It only becomes annoying when using it with a stationary phone.
2,Doesn't work with iPhone 4,Works with my wives iphone 3 but when I plug into my iPhone 4 it adds static and clicking noises to the call.But it's very comfortable to wear and it seems very clear on her phone.
1,my review,I have bought this headset in the past and it always came with 2 booms but this one only came with one. I own 4 of the headsets because the booms are removable and fragile and break--I am forced to buy both a new headset and boom when the boom breaks.
1,The company who sold this sucks,The description said it fits most phones. It didn't fit either of the 2 phones I have. Company refused to let me exchange it and just told me to go buy a converter cord.
1,Garbage,Bottom line is nobody could hear me. Sounded like I was talking in a wind tunnel. Used it for 2 days and threw it away.
1,Don't trust the reviews and specs,"The reviews I read ranked this headset highly. All the reviews and specs ranked the headset highly with multiple and ample cord length. That is all lies! Multiple cords? OK, there are two. Ample length, claiming in excess of 5 feet, NO! One cord is under 6 inches, the other less than 3 feet, not over 5 feet as claimed! Support? Not if not purchased directly from them!!ANNOYED,Tim"
1,Jack is too small,"The package says ""works with most mobile phones."" I wish they listed which ones it works for because the jack on this headset is too small for my Samsung Galaxy smartphone. And given that it's packaged inside of tough plastic that you have to cut apart to get into it, I've lost any chance of returning it. I know I could probably get an adapter for the jack, but given the poor reviews of the sound quality by others, I think it goes to Goodwill."
3,Very nice headset but....,I've owned 4 of these headsets now. It's very comfortable and the sound quality is outstanding. It could stand to be a little bit louder but it's louder than other headsets I've owned. I love the inline mute/volume control.The bad:The earpiece breaks. Every single one that's gone bad on my has been the result of the swivel earpiece breaking. Every time.I use this headset a LOT. I work home office and am on the phone about 2/3 of the day. Each one I've purchased has lasted around 8 months before breaking. I'm not hard on these things but they do get a lot of use.I am currently looking for another model/type of headset to replace the one that just broke today again. It's really too bad because I really love these things for the comfort and sound quality.
2,On the 2nd and last one of these,"I bought one of these and it started having problems months after I got it - the connection into the phone seems to have a break in the wiring and I had to wiggle it to get a clear connection. Finally I got disgusted with it and purchased a new one and that one had the exact same problem, right out of the box. So I am looking for another headset now. I liked the functionality, when it works."
3,"For the price, I thought it included the USB connection.",Fortunately I already had it in the broken item I'm replacing.I shouldn't have to write more than the title to do this rating ... and won't rate things in the future because of this.
3,"Good headset, but","It is uncomfortable to wear. The sound quality is great, it just wears on me rather quickly. I ended up throwing this in a drawer, and haven't used it much since."
3,Does not last very long!,"The headset itself works very well, however they are not very durable. My wife uses this product for work and she is on the telephone many hours each day. We have gone through five or six of these headsets in the course of four years. They only seem to last on average about eight months before something breaks on them or they just stop working."
1,Not for frequent use,"At first I liked the headset, the sound is good, the volume can be adjusted nicely. However, it is inconvenient to put over your ear when you receive calls, and the earpiece broke after about 6 months. I am always surprised that for an old technology (standard telephony) it is so difficult to find good products with decent voice quality and somewhat sturdy."
2,Do not recommend,I use a phone headset daily. I found this over the ear model to be extremely uncomfortable. When using the set people complained that they could not hear me well. I returned this item.
5,Great headset at a good price,"I've had an over-the-head Panasonic headset that I got from Amazon for about two years. It still works but the microphone apparently isn't that effective, as I am frequently asked to speak up. The fact that the over-the-head design also made my head hurt occasionally sent me in search of an improved design. I found this Plantronics under-the-ear headset and thought it was worth trying. After three days, I am very happy. The incoming sound is excellent and adjustable. My voice seems to be heard clearly (also adjustable). The headset is easy to use and very comfortable. Since it's Plantronics, I expect it to last, as they make the headsets used by nearly every call center in America (including one where I worked for many years). In short, I highly recommend this headset, whether it's for your cordless home phone (where I use it) or for your cellphone. Good choice, good quality, good price."
5,Works great on my ATT cordless home phone not 3GS iPhone,"It doesn't fit the iPhone 3GS but thats not why I bought it. It works great in all other phones...Its very comfortable and sound quality was very good, never a problem."
4,Plantronics MX500C Headset,"For the most part and the price, it is fine for my small business use. This is my second one but I know it will need to be replaced because of clip on device in about 3 years. Not bad overall though.Ray"
3,"So-so, earpiece is difficult to use/hear from","Nice idea, and I like the simplicity. The earpiece is akward, though, and doesn't fit well in my ear. I've found it hard to hear some conversations even on the highest volume setting. And thus, I continue my quest for a headset that just f-ing works..."
3,use 8 hours a day,"I bought this headset 6 months ago. After only 1 month, the button to adjust the microphone volume broke. Also, I have to use this headset all day, the ear piece is too big and hurts after a while. It is nice that I can switch ears but I have to be careful because the microphone falls out. Better than most but I'm still on the look out for the perfect headset."
4,"Awesome sound, comfort, usability but flimsy","I have bought a lot of these, I'm on my fourth one now, I think. Even though I keep breaking them, I keep buying them because this product features:- Great sound, both ways- Mute control- Volume control (incoming)- Variable mic gain, two settings (outgoing)- Lightweight- Comfortable to wear for long periods (at least, for me)Now for the downside:- Flimsy- Will disintegrate if looked at directly- Did I mention that it's flimsy?Now admittedly, I'm tough on telecom gear. I'm a highly mobile sales professional, constantly hopping in the car or on a plane, and on the phone all the time. These things sound great, but they will fall apart on you over time.I wrote this review as I was in the process of buying another one, which goes to show you how much I like them, even though they break on me. I've tried a lot of other headsets, but for being on the go I keep coming back to this one."
3,Not for heavy usage,"While this set is comfortable and the sound quality is good, I wouldn't recommend it for heavy usage. I bought these for my 2 employees and myself to use with cell phones. We get a high influx of calls daily and they seem to just stop working after a month or two. After the third one giving out on us, I've decided to look for a different set. It's a shame as otherwise it's a great product."
4,ear piece,It's ok only thing I don't like about this us that it don't have a off button like the other one I purchase.
2,Cheap semi-hard classical guitar case,"I thought this would be a perfect case for my 28 year old semi-decent Yamaha classical guitar, since my 20 year old chipboard guitar case fared pretty well until now. However, I've been disappointed with the quality of this one.Yamaha website [...] shows a picture that looks much better than the one I received. Also, it's supposed to be ""Velour Lined"", which is NOT. In addition, in two places they forgot to cover exposed metals inside the case, making the guitar prone to scratches.I don't think Yamaha really makes guitar cases. This case doesn't even have any identification mark about Yamaha. They possibly subcontract these to the lowest bidder. Apparently, this time they didn't select the right contractor.If the guitar you have is valued more than $150, this case is not even worth considering."
2,Doesn't fit a full size guitar,"I guess I should have checked better before I bought this. It didn't fit the full size guitar I was buying it for, it's just not long enough. I gave it to my son who has a 3/4 and 1/2 size. It's a fairly cheap case but it's a fairly cheap price too."
3,Not quite the standards of the previous films,"As you can see, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is not one of my favorite. The fact that the story doesn't match Victor Hugo's version doesn't affect me even a bit - I'm open to other suggestions! But the music is horrible and the story is dark. Children don't want to be taught of the evil and the goods. The animation is very impressive and beautiful. Fastival of fools is drown beautifully but the characters aren't memorable and the movie lacks the greatness of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. If you have another ulternative, it'd be better."
4,cancer and your pet,"It was a very sad and emotional thing to deal with my dog having cancer, and this book helped me navigate my way through that time. This book had a lot of good information. It explains different types of cancers and different options available from treatment to when it's time to put your baby down. It gives a non-biased view of different options. I got a lot from this book."
5,Excellent!,"This is exactly what I needed! I will be doing my very first NPC Natural Bikini competition on 5/8/2010. I have a coach who is helping me with my posing and stage presence, but since I've never even been to a Bikini show before, I bought this DVD to help me see the overall picture. This DVD provided concise, informative, & inspiring information. I now know what to expect from a Bikini competition... from pre-judging all the way to the evening show. It has lots of footage of actual Bikini shows (my favorite part). The posing and stage presence lessons reinforced what I already learned from my coach. The author explains why certain poses look better for different body types, and posing techniques to compliment your overall appearance. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is new to Bikini competition. I'm glad I bought it!"
4,LAST BATTLES,"As Volume 7 opens, Fenris and Iris are still battling against Bijou, a powerful witch trying to steal Ymir's Heart, and losing! Meanwhile, Chaos and Loki are facing off against Himmelmez and her undead hordes aboard her floating fortress. She has enlisted the aid of Matthew, the dead best friend of Chaos from Fayon, who is now being controlled by her sorcery. Will Chaos be able to destroy his already dead friend, or will Himmelmez win the battle? And where does Sara Irine's loyalties lie? Does she have her own agenda which will disrupt the plans of all involved?Myung-Jin Lee continues his epic action fantasy series with cluttered art and strong plot which might overwhelm or confuse at times. You'll never be bored reading Ragnarok. Good series."
3,Cryptography,"The book is encyclopedia in the field of Cryptography especially when it first appears during 1997. However, after more than 13 years, the book has not been updated. The field of cryptography has evolved dramatically since that time. New ideas, new protocols, new theories have emerged. But unfortuanly the book has not been updated to cover these new materials. I have personally talked to the first author in 2002 and informed that he has no intention to upgrade the book. But at the end of the day, the book is unique and required for any person working with Cryptography."
1,"Good book, Bad print","The latest print of this book bought in May 2012 is terrible. It looks like highly lossy compressed low resolution text had been reprinted. Numerous artifacts around letters and pictures makes this print barely readable. This is a sad thing really, because the book itself is the best reference of crypto algorithms."
5,Konusunda yazlm derli toplu tek kitap (in Turkish),Kitap biraz daha aklamal ve örnekler verilerek zenginletirilebilir. Konularn ak sras allmn dnda.
3,academic style,"The book is thorough and complete, but it is written in the style of academia, where simple things are explained to exhaustion and complex or subtle ideas are often given a single sentence or are simply left to be inferred by the reader."
5,Great Hair Dryer,I've had this hair dryer for at least 2-3 years and it still works great despite the fact that I drop it and step on it all the time.
4,Outlet Adapter,Nice that I found these at Amazon at a lower price than I could find in any store. They do what they're meant to do without breaking the bank. I use them throughout the house where one electrical socket operates the lights for the room....so I can have more than one light turn on with the switch. Another great purchase.
2,Ivory?,"Um, ivory? no. This thing is BROWN. Ok, if I am being generous, tan. Very deceptive picture. I'm sure it works great, but this is not the color it is being advertised."
1,Weird flesh-color,"I suppose this functioned like it was supposed to but I was really put off by the color of the device...it was less ivory, more skin-colored. Plus, it just looked like something that had been manufactured in a back alley and I was worried it might start a fire. I ended up ordering a Belkin device and using that instead."
3,Received Wrong Color,Ordered Ivory. Received a khaki colored one. Adapter didn't cost enough to make it worth sending back for a return. It does what it should though.
2,DECEPTIVE PHOTO!!!!,"The outlet adapter is very well made, but the photo led me to believe that the part which goes into the outlet was 2-pronged but it is really 3-pronged. Clearly a deceptive photo. I'm getting more and more frustrated with Amazon."
4,"Worked great, but it's a 3 prong plug","The picture looks like it's a 2 prong plug that goes into the wall, but it's actually a 3 prong plug. Other than that, it works great."
1,"big, clunky",really there must be something better out there then this. i guess if you need it and it's what you want but it's not the best.
4,Exciting,"This feels silly. A review for a 3-in-1 electrical outlet.Well, I have only good news. My house has not burned down yet due to this device.In fact, I have not detected any problems with it.I do suspect that the plastic will deteriorate in the future and sometime in the next 100 years my offspring will be suing GE for a replacement. Until then, all is well."
1,installed into GFCI outlet. managed to blow fuse in the basement. would not buy again,"plugged in toaster oven (off).plugged in toaster (off).plugged product into GFCI outlet.instantly a bright blue spark emitted from the wall outlet.our landlord had to reset the fuse in the basement. for the remainder of the evening and through the next day we had no power in half our kitchen. my wife had to microwave water for her coffee in the morning, and we had to reset the clock on the stove.also the plug holes dont fit great. ehh"
4,Amazon replaced quickly,"The original was defective, with one outlet dead. Amazon quickly replaced it. Pushing plugs is is hard, very stiff. Hope it'll break in over the years."
1,The critics at the interviews at dawn,"Why is it that I keep buying ""CRITICAL REVIEWS"" of albums DVDs? They don't offer any insight. I have an R0 dvd player, and no matter what region code this is, it sucks.The only time you ever get to see the band is at the end credits, hardly through the copyright sh** that plays on the screen at the same time. The only things the ""experts know"" about the band is what they read from the cue cards. What's really a blasephemy is that the DVD dosen't even use the band's real music, just the cover music! Plus the host is very difficult to look at, let's just say he's extremely English.AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
2,One or Two Positive Notes,"I can't disagree with what the reviewers before me wrote, but I have to say the disc isn't entirely bad. The interviews with Joe Boyd and Norman Smith appeared to be exclusive to this production and I found them pretty enlightening.Smith didn't appear to have had any idea what to do with Pink Floyd at all, did he? He sneeringly refers to their music as ""that psychedelic stuff,"" if I recall correctly.It's tantalizing to wonder what the album would have sounded like with the infintely more sympathetic Boyd at the helm.I also hadn't seen the footage of Gilmour singing Syd's material before. Shame it was just a clip.Otherwise, this is a pretty cheap, cruddy production."
4,MORE INTERESTING THAN ITS SUBJECT IS ITS WRITER,"Nieves Hayat de Madariaga Mathews told us in her 1996 book about her subject, Sir Francis Bacon. Of much more interest is what she, the biological mother of Luis and Javier Solana, told us about herself in that very book:1. Her spiritual teacher was Osho. This is a name better known to American audiences, particularly Antelope, Oregon ones as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.2. Her own fascination with the 'invisible college.'As Javier Solana now holds extraordinary powers over Europe and is about to receive more, his antecedents deserve a more careful review. Nieves Mathews work is perhaps a good launching place."
1,I WANT MONEY ! MONEY ! MONEY !,"Horrible book, no depth at all. Just another product released based on BSB recently acquired fame (which will not last long, I hope ! )"
5,Bright Light! Long Battery Life! Best Value!,"In searching for a bright, smallish flashlight, my main concern was battery life. What good is it to have a good bright light that only last a few hours? This light is very bright, but has one of the longest battery lives I have ever seen. Make sure that the light you choose isn't going to cost you a small fortune in batteries over the next year. I highly reccomend the Streamlight 68200. I even gave one to my Mom, only the best will do!"
2,"Not as Pictured, Not Same Design","The cell pouch pictured is much better than the one shipped from AccessoryOne. The one shipped does not have the ring for using an around the neck lanyard. The belt clip has a square metal wear tab at the bottom that was crimped so poorly that one corner is very sharp and will cut and scratch anything it rubs against, including your belt. If they are going to advertise a feature, the product shipped should have it. I wanted the lanyard ring so I wouldn't have to always have a belt and I did not want the metal at the bottom of the belt clip as these have always been poorly made or badly attached and can scratch your belt or anything else they come in contact with. The one shipped is the worse it could possibly be. there is no material to buffer the sharp corner. Very disappointed in AccessoryOne. Fast shipping, but but product not the same as advertised. Not worth shipping back. You would be hard pressed to get a good one anyway given the quality of the assembly."
1,yaaaaaaaawwwwwwwnnn,"The positive reviews are fake. This movie is so boring and crappy that I can't think of anyone who could like this. This is NOT a horror movie. This would be accurately described as a ""dramatic thriller"". There isn't any gore. Nor is there suspense because the protagonists are never in any danger til the last 10-15 mins. But even then I couldn't feel suspense because the acting and characterizations are so awful that I couldn't feel scared for the characters. I bought this in an 8-horror movie pack so that makes it around 65 cents a movie. But I still think I could have used that 65 cents for something better. This movie was so slow my eyes were droopy 10 mins in. No lie."
2,Written by a wordsmith who likes to read his own words!!,"A complex, multi-dimensional read that I could not wait to put down. I struggled to pick it up to get through it. At any page I could walk away from it, I kept reading the reviews on the back cover and opening pages to see if I was reading the same book. The writing bogged down enough with intricate detail that did not seem related. The characters came in and out of different scenes almost as though they were not connected. I struggled to complete the book only to be disappointed by an ending that seemed to be retro-fitted to the story with yet another twist. It may be that I have little interest in the geography of that region but the book did little to enhance its image. It seems like a dark, fanatical, intense place to visit or live, always on the edge. A disappointing book for all the positive reviews."
2,Glad I'm not the only one who didn't like it...,"I logged on to see if I was the only reader who did not like this book, or wondered why it was nominated for a National Book Award. I'm glad to see most readers share my two-star views. While I was impressed by Stone's vast knowledge, I found the book clunkily written and difficult to get through. My biggest problem was that I simply did not believe in the characters at all (particularly Sonia and Raz). Does anyone use that kind of hipster lingo anymore? Like Don Delillo, Stone is a demanding writer; unlike Delillo he does not reward with the same level of beauty in his prose."
1,Overly detailed and boring,"With all the great reviews, I thought this would be good, especially as I really enjoyed Children of Light. Instead, the first chapter is one of the most boring I have ever read. I tried it a second time, thinking I missed something. I didn't. I thought it would get better. It didn't. This is one of the most arduous and tedious books I've read, with excessive and boring detail about everything. Unlike many other readers, I stop reading at a certain point if a book doesn't interest me. I stopped at page 50. Others who have reviewed this actually finished it, and then say it was really bad. This book is a good reason to stop at 50."
3,dribbling bits of irrelevancy,i was compelled to finish this pile of words simply because the man signed my copy at a book fair. i've never been to israel but Stone's depiction seemed fanciful. it read awkwardly at times and i think his efforts to paint the city as diverse were much too pretentious. it's like he threw darts at an atlas and decided that a character would be from the landing of that dart. nevertheless i respect his thorough research and apparant command of colloquialistic theology. borderline narrative at best.
1,this has got to be the most arduous book i have ever read.,In my opinion there was too much emphasis placed on religion and the religious aspects of the story and the characters rather than cocentrating on the actual storyline. I found this to be tedious and extremely hard work. I couldn't wait to get it over and done with. I felt that after i had finished the book i had lost track of what the author was writing about and felt a great sense of relief at completing it.
1,"His Jerusalem is not real, just a grotesque fantasy","For the last 30 years I have lived in Israel, through good and tough times, and I could not find any similarity between the real Jerusalem, the real Israel, the real Gaza, and the sites which have the same names in Stone's book. It is a grotesque fantasy written with a Hollywood deal in mind. Waste of time"
2,A chore to get through,"While the book may provide some insight into the Mid East situation and Jerusalem in particular, I found the story very long winded with little action and with not wholly believable characters, events etc."
5,Possibly the best book of the year,"Stone takes us to the heart of the oldest conflict at the twilight of the millenium, when many are waiting for the second coming (and some trying to speed it along). His ruminations on faith, fanaticsim, loyalty, and betrayal are deftly intertwined with a relentless plot. Ripped straight from the headlines yet as timeless as any history , Damascus Gate is astounding."
3,Over my Head,"My hope from the outset was that there would be historical aspects that would increase my knowledge of the Holy Land and it's neighbors, but more often than not I was lost in a history that I had never heard of. As well, I found a lot of words (names of, definitions of) things that required me to us a dictionary often.I am no wiser or better informed about this part of the world and what makes it unique after having read this book, but I do think that it was worth the time, effort and work.I mostly enjoyed Damascus Gate, it's characters, and the descriptions of different places, but I wish it had been easier to understand on the whole."
4,A fine view,"The Israel between the lines... This isn't the Israel you see in the papers or on a quick visit, but it exists. Stone did his homework on this one, and found a fine setting for his themes."
2,Spare yourself!,"What has happened to Mr. Stone? This heap of jumbled rambling is not worthy of him. I'm pleased to read a recommendation below for the novel THE LAST DAY, which is a far better example of a tight, well-scripted and plotted suspense novel in this genre. The author is Glen Kleier and THE LAST DAY delivers the kind of excitement and thrills DAMASCUS GATE lacks. Please try harder next time, Mr. Stone! In the meantime, Stone fans, I suggest you try Mr. Kleier to satisfy your craving for heart-pounding fiction."
4,unique thriller set in Israeli bohemian religious undergrnd,"fresh, different, exlnt characters a cool read"
3,Hopes for high-end reading DASHED.,"I had hopes for high-end reading when I picked up this book. Those hopes were dashed as soon as I noticed the authors need to describe what each character (no matter how insignificant) was wearing. These descriptions commonly began with ""He had on"" or ""He wore"" or ""He was dressed in"". These kinds of descriptions usually come from the novice writer, who has little ability to go into the inner workings of a character, and therefore is left to give a coarse description of the outer part of the players, much like we hear at a runway fashion show from the announcer. It was definitely not what I expected from a writer who has, in the past, given us the inner soul of his thoughts and work. In addition, the story looses something in it's narrative stance. It's sad when a good plot and writer display feeble (but failed) attempts at brining the reader into the thick of it. And this book has done just that...failed."
2,Not recommended,"I was very disappointed. This is an immensely talented author. But the book is boring, the worst sin in a novel, and though the setting is well-drawn, I have seen Jerusalem depicted even better in William bayer's PATTERN CRIMES, now out of print. In the end this is a well-written, intellectual novel with characters one doesn't care about. Sad, since this author's novel set in Central America, Red Flag At Sunrise, is a great book!"
3,Dog Soldiers visit the middle east?,"This is a great story, and Mr. Stone tells it very well. At certain points I felt like my head was spinning trying to keep track of all the organizations and people involved, to say nothing of their various psychopathologies. But I think that was at least sometimes part of the author's intent - after all, Jerusalem is a confusing place.The book might have benefited from fewer, and better developed, characters. The characters were certainly interesting, but with the exception of Lucas and Sonia they kind of drifted in and out of the story a bit too much. In a way, this book was like Dog Soldiers Visits Israel or something - there was a lot of overlap in terms of the characters and their hangups, drug problems, etc. Although I enjoyed Dog Soldiers, I was hoping for something different."
3,"The Middle East, a grave to so many victims, finds another.","Robert Stone may well reap numerous awards for this immediate best seller on the basis of his other, more focused works. The characters in Damascus Gate are flat stereotypes who populate a richly described landscape which belongs in a different novel- a novel where the feeling generated by it's protagonists somehow connects to the locale. Stone provides a travelogue of tiny Israel which is gratuitous and also leaves the impression it is at least the size of Texas. And then there is the theological detail- how many sects can one take?- which serves to obfuscate an already muddled situation. This parody may in some sense explain the evening news until, that is, we add a dose of true mental illness ( one character forgets to take his lithium for six months!) which then makes the religious zealots perhaps the most sane people in this story. I expected less heat from Robert Stone, and more light."
1,threw it out after 200 pages,"the charactors are not believable, the whole religious thing is boring, and there are too many mistakes in terms of how Israel realy works. It is almost as though stone spent too much time doing research on religion and not enough on the nature of the place."
3,Damascus Gate revisited,"While I must admit I enjoyed this book merely for the chance to relive a year of my life in Jerusalem as a student at Hebrew University and revisit some of the places I knew, I felt the characters were rather hollow, as has been mentioned by other reviewers. I have vivid memories of real Israelis and real Palestinians with whom I lived and studied and am almost angry to see how superficially they are treated here. Almost angry. I realize it's only a work of fiction. The twists and turns of the plot are what kept me reading. Mr. Stone definitely has a way with description and action. He described my feelings about the Church of the Holy Sepulcre exactly. Although I only gave it three stars I still recommend the book but, as has also been said elsewhere, it's not for everyone."
1,Book about nothing,"It is about nothing. The reviews on the cover are totally misleading, which makes me wonder how people could write such nice things about this junk, which fails to explore all the interesting topics it is supposed to be about. Overall, it is a big failure on rather interesting subject or the array of subjects. Maybe someone should try to come out with something more worthy?"
2,Disjointed and dispiriting,"Do we really need 448 pages of well-written and sometimes sparkling prose to tell us that When the Going gets Unstable, the Unstable Fall to Pieces? I found it difficult to keep straight all the characters and their individual pathologies, and even more difficult to care. After finishing the book, I did not find I had more insight about the theological, political, ethnic, or psychological roots of the Palestinian Question. The book did provide an intense sense of physical location."
1,Unmittigated trash,"Trash; a trashy pot boiler -- ahem, pot-simmerer. Where to start? The characters. Haphazard in every which way; cut from shirt cardboard with the dull scissors you used in kindergarten. The dialogue. Gadzooks!, who speaks like this? -- on this planet anyway. The plot is structured like the webs of those spiders that were given experimental LSD. The diction and narrative quality, well, you could save yourself a lot of time if you just sent for a J. Petermann catalogue. Stone's heart (possibly) could have been in the right place, but whatever that place was, he never found it."
4,The Bookschlepper Recommends,"Chris Lucas, American half-Jewish reporter in Jerusalem, agrees to do a book on the pilgrims to the Holy City who become overly inspired. Beyond the characters with Messianic dreams, there is an assortment of misfits, NGO and U.N. workers, former Communists, archeologists, settlers, nightclub impresarios, drug/arms runners and relief worker wannabes. Stone plots a tight scheme for the coming Millennium and corners the reader in a Bermuda Triangle of intifada, religious zealotry and psyche. I could feel the bullets whizzing past."
1,Much Ado About Nearly Nothing,"I feel like a survivor of this book, after having emerged more or less unscathed from the rubble of its 500 pages. Although I admit it did have its moments of interest, they were few and far between. I found most of the characters totally unsympathetic, boring, and unrealistic...I really could not get myself aroused sufficiently to care whether they made it through to the end with me. I felt it was a lot of work, slogging through the pages and pages of background religious history which was poorly presented. Makes me feel even less interested in visiting the ""Holy Land"" any time soon."
1,Utterly worthless,"As one reader put it, it's a ""tower of babble."" Reading this book I found myself asking where the plot was going, what was happening, and what the hell a lot of the words in this book meant. If an author is going to write a book, he should at least write it in ENGLISH. Robert Stone should get the award for Wosrt Written Book!"
2,A Major Disapointment,"How could such a promising subject be turned into such a disappointing book? By my calculation it takes the reader 178 pages to get into the plot of the story. Once there we're treated to a weak story line that seems to be headed somewhere only to veer off course into one of our hero Chris Lucas's childhood flashbacks. Few of the characters, if any, are developed to their fullest, including Lucas. The only character I cared about was Sonia Barnes, although had she met a tragic end I wouldn't have shed a tear. Long, tedious, and a waste of time."
4,this book is worth the time it takes to read.,"Having just finished Stone's hefty novel and read all the reviews on line, I would like to add my two cents. Yes, the story is complex, daunting, multi-layered, etc.---but every once in a while, the reader owes it to him/herself to pick up something that will really test the old brain power. (Name of the Rose comes to mind, or Incidence of the Fingerpost) Any novel that sends the reader off in search of further knowledge is a valuable addition to the library, and Damascus Gate had me checking the Encyclopedia of Religions, among other sources, in order to gain a further understanding of his plot and characters. Not a book for the beach, nor one which would welcome interruptions while reading - but one which requires constant attention to detail, and a willingness to ponder connections. The author does not spell it all out for the reader - but mental exercise isn't always a bad thing!"
3,"500 pages and an unrivaled canvas, Robert Stone has failed","Despite 500 pages and an unrivaled canvas Robert Sone has failed to produce a work anywhere equal to past efforts. Characters end up being one-dimensional cliches and the plot unfolds in a manner more reminiscent of a pedestrian novelist than what Stone is capable of...more of a James Michener journey of artifice than the grim, bleek regions Stone usually haunts."
3,requires a broad understanding of world religions,To fully appreciate this novel the reader must have a working knowledge of christian and jewish faiths and even thier eccentric off-shoots. The intracacies of these faiths is thick in the first half if not more and it was slow reading for one as ignorant as I in world religions. The good news is that it will force me to go to the non-fiction section for a primer on world religions....and maybe I'll re-read damascus gate with better appreciation!
2,"a review, written ala Robert Stone","""I thought it was pretty bad,"" he said airly. ""How could you?"" she asked drily. ""I don't know. Maybe the novel had too much 'schmeiihuqie,'"" he said, referring to the Babylonian god of pretentiousness. ""Didn't you read the reviews? All those smart people couldn't be schlemiels,"" she said. ""Perhaps it was trahison des clercs,"" he said, realizing he was in love with her. ""I think I need a Prozac."""
3,"It Was the Best of Books, It Was The Worst of Books","I agree with virtually every review in here. Its brilliantly conceived. There are moments of brilliant writing. But every flaw described in these reviews is accurate, and makes it a disappointment,....not just because of what it is, but becaue of what it could have been."
1,Such a tedius read,"I'm very disappointed in this book. I was looking for action and high drama, and instead, got plodding dullness and monotony. The book could have been boiled down to fifty interesting pages by a decent editor. If you want to see how this type of topic can soar, I would highly recommend the vastly more exciting and rivetting novel, THE LAST DAY by Glen Kleier. LAST DAY is the epitome of an end-times thriller that captures all the insanity, action, suspense and poignancy that GATE lacks. I've read LAST DAY three times and will read it again for its amazing depth and power. Also interesting in this genre is Stephen King's THE STAND, which is a bit light weight compared to LAST DAY, but at least entertaining. which GATE wasn't."
2,Stone is too enamoured with his vast vocabulary...,"Just because you know how to ""use it in a sentence"" doesn't always mean that you should... especially if the use of all the grand words one knows interfers with the telling of the story. Stone is too enamoured with his vast vocabulary and thus, alas, the story just does not flow as it might if he wrote as if he were telling us a story rather than composing one. It is too ""literary"" and trying to impress with his ""writing ability"" rather than ""storytelling ability""."
1,Unbelievable plot and unlikable characters!,"Why read a book with characters you don't like and a plot that is so absurd that you feel silly actually reading it? When I start a book, I like to finish it, but this one could be put down at any time and you haven't missed a thing. Definitely NOT worth the hype that preceded it. In fact, it is one of the worst books I have read in a long while. Shame on you, Robert Stone!"
1,Pretentious junk with incomprehensible character repartee.,"This is, perhaps, the most pretentious bit of junk writing I've experienced since my college days. Continued reference to obscure religions, and Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and on words, always in italics, but never with definition or explanation. The repartee between and among characters is effectively incomprehensible because of the language as well as the context. And the plot line is about as muddled as could be, nearly impossible to follow because of the continued introduction of new characters whose presence in the story is never really explained. This is a book I've had trouble finishing and would recommend to no one."
1,Damascus Gate,"PLEASE tell me where is Ethan Hawke reading this audio book? I purchased and returned it due to the fact that he is not mentioned anywhere on the covers and I listened randomly at tapes and did not hear his voice. Is he actually reading it at some point or is this a misprint? I would really like to reorder if he is indeed reading the text; however, I did NOT SEE OR HEAR MENTION OF HIM OTHER THAN THE PRINT IN THE LISTING . PLEASE RESPOND ASAP!CAN YOU TELL ME IF HE IS INDEED GOING TO BE READING BATTLE CREEK OR IS THIS A MISPRINT AS WELL?"
1,This book gave me a migraine!,Who ever led this man to believe he can write! As boorish and contrived a novel as I've ever read.
1,Little red bumps with white heads,I'm truly disappointed that I have to stop using this product as it does seem to help the texture and is very smooth going on and a great moisturizer. The only problem is that I keep getting several little red bumps (pimples) and I'm way past the age of getting pimples and normally don't have this problem. I may give this to someone that might enjoy it and not have this reaction as I've used only a small amount.
2,Gave me pimples...,"This serum worked as it was supposed to. Only thing is I noticed that I was getting pimples. I have been lucky enough not to have had acne; just the occasional pimple every now and again.Once I started using this serum though, I noticed that I was getting several pimples - almost every day. The only thing I had changed in my regimen was the serum so I conducted my own (kinda) control experiment. I stopped using the serum and went back to my regular moisturiser. No pimples. Started using it again, pimples.I've stopped again and decided to give it 2.5 stars because while I was using it, it did make my skin feel great. I just didn't think the ""pimple trade-off"" was worth it.Others may not have the same problem."
3,Some improvement,"Nothing dramatic to report. Been using religiously for 4-5 weeks. I think I look the same, lines, I mean. But it does feel cool going on under makeup."
2,ineffictive,found the product to be ineffective. Im 73 yrs old and my skin in probably aged to much to make a difference. I still use it nightly just to see if there is hope
2,Olay regenerist daily serum,Product had previously been opened. Was under the impression I was purchasing a brand new product that had never been opened.
2,It wan't good for my skin type,"I decided to purchase this facial moisturizer because of the great reviews.Actually, the moisturizer makes my skin soft and smooth instantly but I have extra dry skin. I tried to put extra olay moisturizer every morning and night but a few hours later, my skin always had been getting dry again. Somehow, I finished a whole bottle but I didn't even see any visible improvement in my face.After that, I switched my facial moisturizer to Bliss. Eventually, my face wasn't feeling dry any more. The moisturizer also reduced my visible wrinkles and pigmented spots too.I have some Olay brand at home and most Olay items really work on me. I was expected this moisturizer will solve my dry skin and reduced some winkles. Unfortunately, the moisturizer didn't work for my skin."
4,I'm for it,"I love olay products. This one feels great on the skin, made my face look and feel better...I even like the scent."
4,Olay Regenerist,"My husband, who is 77, is using this product and I think it is helping his skin look more youthful. But it may take a while longer before I see any startling results."
4,Olay,Bought as a gift so I assumed the person liked it. She specifically asked for it so I assumed she had used it before.
3,good,"Definitely seen a difference after a month, I'm 29 didn't have wrinkles but skin was dry and kinda sallow, and regular moisturizers always irritated my skin. This keeps skin looking more hydrated, collagen-ish, and healthy, and has even reduced the dark circles under my eyes. Doesn't feel greasy or oily at all, doesn't make me break out which all other moisturizers have.I would give this a 3.5 but not a 4 bec there is better stuff out there. One can even find recipes at skin care forums, order ingredients from lotioncrafters and mix one's own diy serum for pennies on the dollar.In the meantime l started using a serum from IQ Naturals with hyaluronic acid and matrixyl peptides which costs a bit more but has fewer chemical ingredients and feels even cleaner going on. That is prob the one I will stick with, but if u are on a budget or just starting out with skincare, this olay is prob a good value at the amazon price."
3,Harsh on sensitive skin,"This is the only product from Olay I have ever had difficulty with. I have sensitive, dry skin and I found this product somewhat agitating. I think I will retry it once the weather changes to see if my skin can tolerate it more then."
3,gave me breakouts!,"I've been an Olay user for almost 10 years now, and swear by this brand. In fact, this is the only brand that hydrates my super fussy sensitive/oily skin without making it breakout or leaving it too dry.I used this serum for a week, once a day around my nose area, eyes, laugh lines and frown lines, and put my regular total effects moisturizer over it. It didn't feel greasy, but the areas I put the serum definitely looked greasy, I had to dab extra powder. After a few days, I noticed I was getting breakouts in the areas I put the serum. Too bad, the serum feels good going on, and feels good staying on.So I'm using it just around my eyes for now. If you have oily/acne prone skin, you may want to stay away from this."
2,Didn't like,This product made my skin itch like crazy and I broke out with little fluid blisters..I use the moisturizer daily which doesn't bother me at all though...
2,product arrived in a bad condition,"I've ordered two Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum. Unfortunately both of the boxes were broken, and one of them was open and some of the cream has been spilled all over the box. Those were intended to be given as a gift and I was very disappointed by the condition I've received them. I've contacted MedSource Direct customer service by e-mail, however didn't get any response from them. Hopefully the product itself is OK (it was given as a gift)."
1,Tested on Animals,"Olay is made from Proctor and Gamble, a company that still tests on animals even when it is NOT required by law. They will swear these tests are necessar and a 'last resort', but if that's true then how is it that names like Avon don't test on animals?This product is not worth vanity! Try Avon or Almay instead!!!"
1,"I have been researching cancer cites and finding that MOST of the cosmetics, including Olay products, have carcinogents in them","I have researched many of the cancer sites and find that most of the cosmetics I have been using, including Oil of Olay, and find it quite scary that so many carcinogens are in these products. Where is Ralph Nadar? We need him.ra"
1,Sent me an opened bottle,"I ordered this from Amazon.com recently. When it arrived, I noticed that the product packaging seals were missing and the packaging had already been opened. I unscrewed the top and noticed that the level of lotion in the bottle was lower than what one would expect from a new product.I haven't had this problem with Amazon before, so I am giving them the benefit of doubt, and asking them to send me another one as a replacement. Hope the new one hasn't been used or tampered with."
5,Pleasantly Surprised! (Which is why I need it.),"After reading all of the excellent reviews, I purchased this product for that vertical frown line that appears between your eyebrows--(Too many warning looks to my children!) I have used this product for a week, only once a day before bed, so I can make the small bottle last longer. In just a week, the line is thinning and becoming barely noticeable. I'm always a bit skeptical about these types of things, so I'm thrilled that it's actually working on my aging forehead."
2,Broke Out,"I was so excited to start using this because of the wonderful reviews. I tried it the night I got it and I saw no difference. When I woke up the next morning, my face was sort of itchy. I also had red patches on my face too. I just ignored it because I thought it was something else. I used it again and once again, I saw no difference. One morning I opened my eyes to see my face filled with white heads! I haven't broken out in awhile and it was horrifying. I'm going to return this :( I'm so disappointed. I've never broken out from a product before."
1,Disappointed,"I tried this product based on the great reviews, what a mistake! I don't have ultra sensitive skin, but as soon as I started using this product my skin started breaking out. I used the product for a week straight. My skin was nice and smooth, didn't notice any minimizing of fine lines (only 34 years old). Like another reviewer said soft skin is not worth the acne breakouts. Disappointing."
5,The lightest cream ever,"this feels wonderful when applied. so light u almost don't know it's there, with just the right creaminess. i use this at the very end, after microdermabrasion & peel kit. it's very smoothing & cooling. no oily residue."
4,a good serum,"I've been using Borghese/Kirkland face serum for a few years and love it. I decided to try the Regenerist products and purchased the eye serum, face serum and daily moisturizer. I read all of the positive reviews about the face serum but wasn't expecting it to be any better than the Borghese/Kirkland. I'm pleasantly surprised. It has a similar gel-like consistency but seems to absorb more quickly. For that reason, it feels lighter on my skin. I guess I'm a convert."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this product, but I have to be honest and say that I cannot notice any difference in the way my skin looks in the 2 weeks I have been using it. People tell me I have ""good skin"" to begin with, however I do have lines around my eyes and on my forehead. The only positive difference that I have noticed is that my normally dry skin is less dry. The worst thing is that this product has actually caused me to break out! I can't remember when, if ever, I had pimples on my cheeks. I am going to have to stop using this and continue my search for a good moisturizer. Oh well."
3,great day moisturizer,"I use it every day as it is a best there is for me with allergies. Wish the hint of foundation had continued, but can no longer find it."
5,"Great Serum, No Scent, Perfect for Men","I've been looking for a reasonably-priced antioxidant serum, and this is the best drugstore version I've found. As someone with combination skin, I don't generally use a moisturizer, however this product provides all the moisture I need. It has an incredibly lightweight/silky feel on my skin, and dries to a matte finish. I use it on my entire face, specifically around the eye region.The combination of B vitamins and amino-peptides is great for my skin, and I wear it under my sunscreen daily. As a man, I like that the product is fragrance-free, and just makes my skin just look ""healthy."""
2,"Just did not seem like full strength, almost like it had been diluted with fillers.",I have used Regenerist for years and this did not feel as nice on my face as product purchased in the store. Not happy with this product at all. Wal-mart's knock off is better than this.
3,it was ok!,"I havent used it completely because i had sensitive skin and i observed very mild irritation of my skin after using this..but i this it is fine..it doesnt smell at all.,..its good for those who are sensitive to smell.."
3,Mostly happy,"The product was what I had expected and I am happy with that, especially for the price. But, the pump on the bottle was broken, so I have to open it to use it, which is inconvenient."
2,PalLagunaNiguel,"I was not impressed with this product and gave it to my girlfriend. I prefer to use a primer before applying my makeup and didn't notice any difference in lines, skin texture, etc."
5,Glow,It was odd to me that after my first use a co-worker mentioned that my skin was glowing. It could have been a combination of things but I actually think this product works. I have been using it at night and in the morning for 3 weeks now and have noticed a difference in the tone of my skin. I did not get the tingling effect everyone else posted about nor the flushing. I really like it and will purchase it again.
5,Olay Regenerating Serum,I have always loved using Olay. I have to be careful on what goes on my skin. I have very sensitive skin. I use this product and have for a long time. It is very light on your skin and it doesn't break me out. I would recommend it to anyone that is sensitive to beauty products.
3,Olay,"This serum was fine, but I certainly didn't see any improvement and I bought a second bottle to be sure. For me, and I am old, it wasn't worth the extra money."
4,"So Far, So Good","It's only been about 2 weeks since I started using this and I have to admit, it does appear to be lessening those vertical lines above my eyebrow and the tiny but frustrating lines around my mouth. I'm hoping this trend continues! And it hasn't made me break out or made me too oily. So we'll see..."
5,Really works!,"I started using Regenerist when I was 40. My skin has always looked older than I am, and I received a couple of free samples. You use such a tiny bit that the samples lasted me about 10 days.My skin looked and felt so nice after 10 days that I went ahead and bought some. I thought it was too expensive at the time, but that little tiny bottle lasted a long time!I've been using it for six years now and I can certainly tell when I run out. This helps with the little tiny patchwork of lines that show up on my eye lids, and really makes my skin soft and somehow more alive looking."
4,Great Product,"This product works well. My face/neck is moisturized and smooth. Also, I put it around my eyes without any problem and I have sensitive skin."
5,"TOPS, FOR THE PRICE!","Believe me, this stuff is the best you can get, without a prescription! It is right up there, in the same league as RETIN-A. I know how this works; I am a Biochemist! Regenerist stimulates Collagen growth, both in the upper layers of the epidermis and underneath the skin.Morrey C... <a rel=""dofollow""href=""[...]"
1,WARNING! They test on animals!,"I just found out they test on animals, my money (vote to promote this) is not going to that! I now quickly Google any product, why should they do this if it's ""Natural"" supposedly? We don't live in the stone ages, it is so barbaric and wrong!"
2,NOT fragrance free,"While there may be no added fragrance, this product is definitely NOT fragrance free. It has a very chemically odor that is quite strong. Strong enough that my husband could smell it on me about 5 hours after i had first used it. That being said, it did seem to be of some benefit, although i cannot use it due to the smell."
5,It does renew,This product does renew your skin. I have used it for years and will continue for as long as it is available. I'm a mature female with aging skin so this product is perfect for my skin type.
2,Save your money,"I bought this product because of all the rave reviews on Amazon. The reviews were so good I bought TWO bottles. This cream is nice, I will keep using it because I have very dry skin, and a little bit goes a very long way. As far as all the miracles it is said to perform - I have seen no changes in elasticity, wrinkles, or dark circles and I have been using the product for 6 weeks."
4,Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum,"I use this produce all the time and I am very satisfied with it. It was a good price, and good service."
3,Nothing great!!,"I bought the fragrance free version bC i have sensitive skin after reading the reviews here and was so exited about using this.Its not like it works wonders.The only thing i noticed is that my faCe felt so smooth and velvety to touch but it didn't smooth my facial skin.THE FINE LINES AND WRINKLES I RECENTLY DEVELOPED DIDN'T CHANGE AT ALL,i AM 31 BTW.The greatest disappointment was that my forehead broke out with tiny rashes and had some red spots on my cheeks.I had to stop using it after two and half weeks of use.Now its a waste.I really feel bad!"
4,Like this product,"I like this serum, it feels good and a little goes a long way. I also love the fact that I can buy it on the subscribe and save option. However, I do not have any idea if it has physically made a difference to my skin!"
3,Its ok,"It helps. It seems to make wrinkle lines a little less pronounced, but do not expect miracles. Better than nothing for sure."
2,"doesn't help wrinkles much, but won't irritate eyes like other products","for the longest time i didn't use under eye creams because just about every single one irritated my sensitive eyes.after having issues with more expensive creams like kinerase, i picked olay up at the store figuring with it's inexpensive price and good reviews on here, it wouldn't hurt to try.well, after using the bottle up here's my thoughts:* it helps a teensy weensy bit with under eye wrinkles and crows feet, but not enough that i would consider purchasing it again.* it's best redeeming quality is it does not irritate my very sensitve eyes. i have probably the worst problem with that- i can only use one type of contact lens cleaner!i would only recommend this to someone who has tried every other option out there and all were irritating or didn't work. otherwise, save your money."
5,Works great on fine lines!,"I started noticing small fine lines around my mouth about a year and a half ago. I started applying this product at night and in the morning. I have definitely noticed a difference. Of course, it does not erase the lines, but it does make them much less visible. I also notice a stark contrast between when I use the product and when I don't. This product has worked better than a number of higher priced products I have purchased at the beauty counter."
4,"Non greasy, matt finish","I use this serum and micro sculpting cream everyday. Here is Pro vs. Con: Pro; these conbination create matt finish like makeup primer even at high humidity day, no irritation. The price is great.Con; it is not enough moisturizing for winter. There is no drastically change my skin, I saw very slight change.I used to spend $$$ for anti aging products at department store. Of course, I do not expect same results as over $100 of products. Olay is good budget friendly products, I cannot complain with the price of it."
3,Love it but concern on some of the ingredients,"I used this product and love it. When my cousin told me that some of olay products contains ingredients that are deemed as ""cancer causing in animal"" and organ toxicity etc.... according to skin deep web site. I google those ingredients and found that four ingredients cyclopentasiloxane(first ingredient), Ethyparaben, propylparaben and methylparaben(actually banned in Europe to be used in skin product) are the bad ingredient. I am now totally torned as I love it on my skin and concerned that it might be the causes for my fribromygia. So, I hope Olay will remove these ingredients and produce some product that are green and non-toxic."
4,Light & smooth,"I'm skeptical that any product can actually reverse the signs of aging, but I've been using this for years and nobody believes I'm 50. I think it can and does slow the signs and work in a preventative way. Additionally, the product is light and smooth - works well under foundation."
1,Yuck,"I read the reviews and I gotta say, all this magical tingly feeling some people feel... I didn't feel it. My pores seemed more noticeable and my face was even a little drier, making my fine lines look not so fine. I threw it out and told my mother not to try it."
2,Suitable Only for the Most Advanced Climber (and PhD),"I was very disappointed in Ms. Reynolds-Sagar's volume. If you're not already climbing at very high levels of performance this is not the book for you. That her advice targets a small elite audience is hardly the only short-coming of her work. She is obviously an academic at heart. This is clear from her unnecessarily obscure language and tortured style of communications. So, if you're a PhD in exercise something or other and are pushing to improve from 5.12 to 5.13 snap up this work. Otherwise, save your money."
5,Boxers or Briefs? Is a Keeper,"Great word association game, that promotes hilarious group interaction. If you're not afraid of people picking on you, and if you like to laugh a lot, than you'll enjoy this game. Surprisingly it accomadates quite a large group without sacrificing the overall game experience. It is simple enough for anyone, yet challenging enough to allow for the competitive spirit in you. The game is not for youngsters as there are cards with quite mature themes, as well as many others that imply mature themes."
3,It's ok,"I was so excited to play this game, and we just played it last night with a couple of friends. The game is just ""so-so"" we laugh a couple of times but is not HILARIOUS. It's quite entertaining but I don't see myself or my friends playing this game again. What I didn't like is that the cards have the phrases printed on both sides, and we just didnt know what to do, at the end we ended up playing with both sides to have more phrases to choose from. I would recommend this game for teenagers, my friends and I are all in our mid 20's and it was ok, but a much younger person might enjoy it more than we did. I guess we were expectiong more, but I have to say, the price was perfect, we paid $8 dollars at walmart, I can't imagine a reason why somebody should pay more than that for this specific game."
5,Fun!,"I bought this game after looking at all the reviews here, when I was looking for something other than Cranium because we play it all the time. It was a lot of fun, but kind of repetitive after a while. Not like Cranium where theres more interaction and movement, its just reading cards and sitting in one place. I think its a lot more fun the more people you read. Sometimes its hard to find a good answer with the options they give you on the cards, so its kind of hard to win without a lot of luck. Its sort of like Apples to Apples, but you're talking about a person instead of a subject. Fun though, its cheap enough that I would get it just to try it!"
4,Boxers of Briefs - OK,"This game is awesome, but the condition of the game was a little sub par. It was a little beat up, either prior to shipping or during shipping. It didn't effect the game however, just the box."
2,Definitely NOT P.C.,"Bought this to play with adults at different gatherings, but found some of the questions lacking in courtesy and were definitely not ""politically correct"". While humor is wonderful, some of these questions made me feel very uncomfortable and I felt I needed to remove those cards so no one was insulted."
5,Best game for teenagers,Best game ever for teenagers! They love getting there friends together and playing this game! Hours of fun and laughs! This game gets them interacting and not just sitting in front of the TV playing video games or watching a movie!
5,It's back! Hurrah!,"So glad this game is being made again. We LOVE our copy, but then tried to find it as gifts and it was only available used for a couple hundred dollars. I do love the game, but couldn't afford a $200 board game gift!Thank you thank you Hasbro for listening to your fans and remaking this game!Hurrah!"
3,Good fun,This game is a based on the same idea as Apples to Apples. Some funny phrases on some of the cards but I think you'll find it's more fun if you create your own cards. My friends and I have played a few times and found the homemade cards more amusing.
5,best game ever,"My wife and I absolutely love this game. We have been looking for it in stores for over 2 years now, and I finally got the bright idea to look on Amazon. This game is a little more PG-13 than your typical board/card game, with some suggestive humor and the like. It adds a lot to a couples night or small gathering. Highly recommend this game."
5,Funny and kept the family laughing,I bought this for when my inlaws visited and it was just so much fun to play. I would recommend it to families that enjoy playing games over drinks.
5,Great game,Totally Fun game - mostly for 12+ ages. We had a ton of fun playing this game. We laughed until we cried at some of the matches. Great family or party game.
3,Boxers review,"This is a fun game, but the question cards were not printed correctly so you cannot use all of the and cuts the game in half."
1,I'm sorry but this just isn't very good,"I bought this CD based on all the 5 star reviews here but now I really wish there were music samples for all the CDs on Amazon so that I wouldn't have bought it. Honestly, this music is just so mediocre that I really think every song is filler. I'm not sure why all the great reviews were posted and I really feel sorry for the reviewers as there is so much great music out there that you are probably missing out on."
5,Has made a huge difference in my relationship with Christ,Bill McCartney can only be considered a Christian soldier by anyone's analysis. To learn that a man like him suffers from the same sins and temptations as you is enlightening and empowering. Reading this book has lead me back to the Bible and Christ. Thanks Bill
4,Important Book for Dedicated Christian Men,"Bill McCartney writes of his struggle to balance family with his ferver for God and career. It is a struggle that many Christian men face. McCarney has made me look at my own relationship with God and make some changes. The book is somewhat repetitious on some topics, however, and could get to the point quicker. Overall, the book is worthwhile reading and will help many men search out God on a more personal level and will allow some men to work on their dedication to their wives."
4,Great action figure for a preschooler,"Excellent because there are not a lot of small parts, yet it talks and has a light up ""laser."" Our kids (2 and 4 years) have a lot of fun with it."
1,Poor Design!,"My son LOVES this toy! He is 3 and just can't get enough of it...I, on the other hand want to throw it away and buy the Disney version of it.Here is the probelem with the Hasbro model...The wing span & backpack fall off every 30 seconds of play.So my son is constantly saying...""Look mommy his impressive wingspan fell off again!""so sad.I hope this help:)"
5,To Infinity... and Beyond!~,"My son has four or five Buzz Lightyears from when he was younger. He's now eight. My nephew is three and LOVES Buzz... but there doesn't seem to be as much Buzz stuff available. Anyway, I thought we'd give him one of ours, but my son wouldn't part with them. He's still very much a Buzz fan and loves his Buzz toys. So, we bought this Nighttime Buzz (which my son doesn't have) and they LOVED it! It shoots a plastic missile and has a laser beam too that projects Zurg's image and they were ""shooting him."" I'd be concerned with the small plastic missile if you have a young child... watch them closely, or just put it away for when they're a bit older. Otherwise... this is a GREAT toy and we highly recommend it!~"
5,"All action, all zeppelin!","While Lester Dent's belated fame rests squarely on the broad bronze shoulders of Doc Savage, it should noted that in the pulp era he was one of the most prolific -- and one of the best -- adventure writers of his time. He had the ability to hang a pulse-pounding top-notch fists-flying tale around even the slimmest of ideas. Here collected are some great actioners that involve rigid airships, an idea that was already on the wane (before the nail was pounded into the coffin at Lakehurst, M.J.) in Dent's time. In our time, the zeppelin has become a metaphor for ages lost and better histories that might have been, and Dent's tales supremely capture and feed our cultural longing. Anyone who loves the Doc Savage stories (remember, he had his own airship stored in the New York City waterfront warehouse of the Hildalgo Trading Company)will certainly enjoy these other adventure tales woven on the loom of Dent's imagination."
5,Fantastic Zeppelin Stories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh, WOW!! A superb book reprinting early pulp yarns by Lester Dent. All featuring ZEPPELINS by the creator of DOC SAVAGE!I enjoyed every tale, and what a page turner! It was a hoot to relive life in the late 1920s and early 1930s! OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!Now, when can I expect a volume two??????????????Terry KlasekHazelwood, Missouri"
3,Don't do it,"Amazon has had my order for NINE months and in spite of emails to them, no adequate response, item is available at King Arthurs Flour"
1,this item is no good!,"i received the product and within a week it was already malfunctioning. at this point it is completely useless and almost not worth the postage to return it to the manufacturer. i have never been more disappointed in a purchase and i guess the saying is true,""you get what you pay for""."
3,flax seed eye mask,"My father had his own jar of flax seeds (try finding one in the chain drugstores today) and would apply these using a tie-bundled handkerchief to relax tired and stressed eyes. I ran across my first black (non-silk pillowed) eye mask in Oklahoma City where it helped to de-stress from those 5-mile high thunderstorms and tracking tornadoes overnight. I purchased this mask to replace the original. I'm not a fan of the silk pillow, and will be seeking a way of removing it from its cover case, but I noticed that the main pillow is also silk. I'm also not a fan of its lack of volume--the original mask I referenced was a bulky and ""manly"" pillow whereas this one seems it could fly off with a heavy sigh.It is unscented, however, and the aroma of flaxseed is sufficient to calm the eyes."
3,Nice but cover falls off,"This eye pillow has a lovely silk covering that's very soft and the pillow itself is a nice weight. However, after two months the little pillow case started to stretch out and the inner pillow keeps trying to escape (it succeeds too). That's because the fabric on the open end is just folded over like a sandwich bag. This would be much improved with a zipper at the end like some eye pillows. For a quick fix, I hand stitched the end shut but that means I no longer have a removable cover for washing. A small strip of velcro sewn at the end might be a better solution but that's more bother, and it could be tricky to try to sew velcro strips to this slippery silk. Velcro applied with glue wouldn't be a good choice for silk either."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","It smells great, it feels great, I can't sleep without it. This is my second one. I had the first for about ten years, then the seams started to break down and the flax seeds began to spill out--but it lasted a long time.It's just so cool and comforting...I highly recommend."
5,Wonderful experience,I was very happy to receive my purchase of the Celetial Dreams Sleep eye pillows. They were for gifts. They arrived in good conditions and packed very well.
5,I Love Them All--fighting for what they believed in!,"I remembered enough from my chilhood that made me purchase these videos--I am on the 4th season now. They have not disappointed me! Every character and every story is worth watching. Plus, you get to see some very, very good stars in their younger years. My husband and I have made it an every night event. We sit down at 8 p.m. and watch an episode. Since there is almost nothing on the TV/Cable, it gives us something of value to entertain us for an hour before bedtime. My husband and I have also enjoyed the interviews of cast members and directors/writers. I only wish that they made TV shows like this now."
1,bad print and design quality,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of this book.The pictures are all pale, desaturated and sometimes out of focus!The layout of this book is something to be desired as well. All Michaelangelo frescoes are ""widescreen"", so pretty much every single picture span 2 pages. So how I am supposed to enjoy the picture with the book's fold in between??Creation of Adam, the most famous fresco is never even given in full size.What a pathetic book with such an outrageous price!"
3,Good price but they wear out quick,I bought this sandpaper package for my woodworking projects and have been pretty satisfied. They attach easily to my Ryobi random orbit sander. I use the 80 and 120 grit disks more often and have noticed that these don't last more than a couple of minutes before the edges begin to tear and fray. Sanding an end table would probably go through at least 2 discs per grit.
3,Wear out quickly,"There are a lot of sheets included, but they wear out very quickly. I also bought a few sheets of a different brand at my local home depot, and that sand paper lasts much longer. This pack is much cheaper than those available at the home depot, but I go through them much quicker."
1,Not good on wood.,If you are working with wood do not order these. They are very thin and do not last very long. Should have spent the extra money because it would have saved time and money.
3,Great abrasive - if you can keep it on the sander.,"I received my 50 disk pack with 5 separate grits, just in time for a bookshelf project. I tore my worn national brand disk off of the sanding pad and slapped the new Mirka 120 grit on. It lasted about 5 seconds, til it went flying and hit my daughter in the face. I am really glad she was wearing a full face mask. I reapplied the disk and had the same result. I switched to other grits in the package with the same result. Then I chose a third national brand from my stock and tried it. It stayed on with no problem and I finished the project.Conclusion: I will use these disks only when sanding large panels. Any bump or curve in the work surface is enough to throw the disk. They do work fairly well on the lathe for small projects. I will probably not buy again until the hook and look system improves."
5,They are what they say they are,"Okay, first of all, they are just sanding disks.I've used about 1/3 of them so far, mostly the mid/high grit ones, and I don't see the expensive one at HD doing any better job. I'll probably reorder soon if they are still available."
5,Great sandpaper,"Will never use another sandpaper, cheap price for sandpaper and a good value. Don't hesitate to use."
3,It doesn't live up to...,The store I bought it from was fast in it's delivery. However I find that the sandpaper did not live up to most of the reviews. I could not tell if it lasted any longer then the sandpaper I bought at Lowes. I did find selection and price did beat Lowes or Home depot.
4,Better than expected,"I ordered these sanding disks along with a Dewalt Random Orbital sander. Due to an inventory shortage, the sander was delayed in shipping, causing me to purchase one locally. This sanding disks, though, arrived in just a few days. These disks work better than I might have hoped. They were instrumental in the remodel of a 100 yr old kitchen. I used the disks and the sander to refinish my kitchen cabinets. The disks worked like a charm!"
5,Nice variety pack. Works great on dewalt sander,Nice variety pack. Works great on my dewalt sander. I like having multiple grit sanding disks on hand.....Nice variety pack. Works great on my dewalt sander. I like having multiple grit sanding disks on hand.....
3,Good but not the best,These are good quality. I've used them to sand down epoxy (I'm building a lapstrake glued boat) and the 100 grit paper does a good job. The epoxy gums up the grit pretty quickly. I've tried other name brand varieties and had similar results. These are a good buy but be prepared to use them pretty quickly if you're sanding epoxy.
4,Good sanding disk,"This is the first time I have tried Mirka sanding discs & this is the reason why I went with the assortment rather than bulk of one grit. I have used about 15 of the Mirka discs so far and they are doing good. Excuse me for being kinda blah about them, but have been disappointed with some of the other brands I have used in the past, so it's hard to be too enthusiastic having only have used them a short time. Not only that, but I hate sanding. Amazon price is good for this brand."
2,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with these discs. I expected them to be better but the grit is not very sharp and requires too much pressure to remove a decent amount of material. Not in the same class with Mirka open weave product and not as good as Klingspor, Norton or Sandeze."
2,Goes too quickly,"I tried this on two expensive (new) sanders with the same result. The backing for it wont stick on the sides nearly as long as other brands. For the price though, it almost makes it worth a good buy but be weary of this.Note: For disks that last longer with velcro, they also cost a lot more even on here which doesn't make it a good financial choice."
3,Sandpaper discs not as good for metal/rust removing as I thot,"I don't know if I expected too much, but I thot rust would come off easy with these. It worked to a certain degree. I am an artist and I paint on old sawblades at times. Need to sand the blades first, then rustproof. Then prime, then paint. Maybe I am doing something wrong? I just used the coarsest grit and went over and over it. Should I have used another kind of sanding disc? Or finer grits? I love the ease of on/off on the sander."
5,Good Sand Paper Disks at Good Bulk Purchase Price,"If you are into woodworking, or planning to be, you will go through a lot of these and the bulk variety pack was a great fit for my needs. The sanding disks are about average in quality and longevity...maybe a little above average. Just make sure you need the ""hook and loop"" type and not the adhesive backed disks before you buy."
5,Really Good Deal,"So far I have sanded maple, birch, poplar and pine and have used 80, 150 and 220 grit. I am very pleased with the life and quality of these discs. The 80 really removes wood fast and the 220 gives a nice smooth surface to finish. I wish they came in a 100 pack. Will buy these again for sure."
5,Nice assortment of sanding grits,"I recently bought a random orbit sander from Amazon and decided to get this assortment of 5"" 8 hole sanding discs to go with the sander. I've heard of ""Mirka"" as a supplier of various sanding products and I'm happy with this assortment. I plan to be ordering 50 disc boxes of specific grits in the future after I've use this assortment pack....I should know what grits I want based on my experience with the assortment pack. The price of this product and free shipping make it an attractive purchase from Amazon."
3,"Good choice for softer woods, not hardwoods","These disks are on par wit a Klingspor which for most projects would be great. Unfortunately, I usually work with hardwood. The Mirka are worth a try but be aware if you are too aggressive on hardwoods, these will not last as you may have anticipated. For hardwoods I usually use blue zirconia - these discs will outlast all other types especially hard materials such as hard wood, metal, fiberglass, gel coats, etc. Or a premiium red A.O. resin on heavy ""E"" or ""F"" weight paper. For the price of the Mirka I would recommend them for most applications."
5,A TERRIFIC VALUE!,"Not sure how much more I can say about sanding disks other than the title of my review.I was not familiar with the Mirka name and was very pleasantly surprised at the cost and quality. Been buying Norton abrasives, at the big box stores and Mirka blows Norton away, both in quality and cost per disk.The sanding projects I have used these disks on has mostly been for sanding pine and a little oak. Seems to hold up well in both cases. Did use a 80 grit disk to remove some surface rust from a rusty shovel. Did OK... but I suspect there are better abrasives for that type of job.Try a box of these. You won't be sorry."
5,best all-purpose paper around,"I've used this paper regularly for varied materials... metal prep, hardwoods, soft woods, fiberglass, plastics... Mirka has always been one of the top brands and they've been fairly consistent in quality. Very good clog-resistance for all materials I've tried so far. Plus, a great price for a 50-pk assortment... will definitely be ordering more here as I need them."
3,"Decent value, but they wear out quickly","This is a nice choice for a general set of various sized sanding disks. I use this on my DeWalt D26451K random orbit sander. The hook and loop disks stick to the sander's pad quite nicely. The holes are a little misaligned for that particular sander, but it's good enough to collect some dust. My big disappointment is that the disks don't last all that long. Other reviewers have mentioned that their disks lasted a long time, but I couldn't sand very much board before it became less effective and visibly worn. Maybe I got a bad batch or my surface is too rough? In any case, given the price, you can't really go wrong so I'll be ordering the sizes I use most in larger packages."
5,Jim Davis's excellent book,"A great book if you like Garfield. I like the cat and the dog too. I didn't like how the man put the collar on the dog, it was cruel of him."
1,sophmoric plots,"Why is this even considered as worthy of printing? It is akin to a highschool read plus some naughty words thrown in for shock value.While Iunderstand this is supposed to be erotic romance as opposed to romantic fiction,I found the story line so unbelievable and the rate at which the characters ""fall in love"" (or in lust,more correctly) that it made me want to remind the writer that the true nature of sexual love does not lie in the southern region of our anatomies. A totally amateur work andI strongly suggest you avoid it."
5,Worship Me . . . A Techno-God,"Okay,Superstar DJ Keoki may seem a bit pompous in proclaiming himself a techno-god. All you need to do is listen to one of his many works and you'll be telling your friends the same thing.His mixes are unbelievable, mind blowing, and will tranceport you on a new musical plateau.Enough big words. Buy this disc, it's among his best. One listen and you'll want more"
4,Looking bleak,"In the history of life on earth there have been five great extinction spasms - the best known being the evaporation of the dinosaurs following the calamitous arrival of a large interstellar object. Based on the latest discoveries in evolutionary biology and ecology, paleontologist Leakey believes we humans are creating a sixth such catastrophe in which fully half of the earth's species may die out during the next century. He sees no reason to assume that humans are immune to the debacle. Included is a stinging rebuke of those who defend hunting as part of sound wildlife management. Quite readable, non-technical, scary."
4,The Sixth Book I've Ever Read,"Overall, this book presents an uncompariable insight into the future of mankind, but more importantly all life that is currently on Earth, and will be for years to come. Richard Leakey, the author of The Sixth Extinction, provides the reader with multiple theories and explanations of the evolution of species. We're in the midst of an intellectual revolution of which we as a species have two paths. One path leads to harmony and peace between man and nature, and the other path leads to a mass extinction- the sixth extinction"
5,6th extinction A.P.E.S.,"The Sixth Extinction by Richard Leakey outlined the five past major extinctions in the history of the Earth and the trends toward a sixth extinction of the Homo Sapien species. Leakey emphasized negative effects humans have on species diversity. He also stressed the importance of species diversity in the stability of ecosystems. With 30,000 species going extinct every year, humans are having adverse effects on the life on Earth, and eventually it will effect the human race. The book was intuitive and tied together wonderfully with references to many studies and research by various other scientists and philosophers."
4,Sixth Extinction Review,"This book had a really interesting beginning (about the first 3/4 of the book), and had a lot of information about the past. It described past extinctions (especially the five mass extinctions), the way different species have evolved, and similar topics. There was not only facts and statistics, but Leakey also included little stories that tied into whatever he was describing. The last section of the book wasn't as interesting, and it talked more about how humans are becoming the cause of the sixth big extinction. It makes you realize how bad the situation is becoming, and that we need to do something soon. Highly recommended."
3,Sixth Extinction Group Review,"The book was just average because ofa few flaws. The book seems to be a collection of random thoughts at times, sometimes confusing the reader. The author also focused on some small aspects and made an interesting story boring. A strong part of the book is the depth in which he explains biodiversity. This leaves the reader with information they did not have before they read. We recommend this book only for those interested in the environment."
5,excellent,"A beautifully written alarm call for the world, and yet short enough to be read by all those to whom it concerns which is everybody."
3,the sixth extinction,"The overall opinions of this book are relatively positive . We all have come to the genteral consenses that Leakey's book is very informatibe and detailed. He explained the stages through tome that have come to the amount to the evolution of humans and the vairous results of each stage. However, we as a group did agree that Leakey was rather reprtitve. We believe that with a little less information reiterated again and again. The sixth extinction could be a very interesting and insightful book, offering qhuite a bit of useful knowledge."
2,Overhyped sludge,"Sounds exactly like you would think: Pinback if they were still a garage band of young angry ones or Black Heart Procession without all the waves of beauty. The lo-fi production and scratchy, overbearing vocals do not seem to compliment the sound this band is trying for with this record, but I suppose they work their unique approach well enough to have garnered their minor cult following, closing out the album with their longest and most cohesive track."
4,Good for a mic less than $10,"So far I've used this mic for an audio interview, an amateur band recording session, and internet telephony. If you plan on chatting to friends online, get yourself a headset instead, it's far more comfortable than holding this thing up to your face for a long period of time. If you're passing it back and forth as different people talk, or if you have a stand/somewhere to set it on when recording something, it's good enough considering how cheap it is."
2,Silly,"These cartoon-like books that Venezia puts out are pretty lame. They include more art by him than the artist covered. They look like cartoons or comic books and read like one. They do hold some valuable information, but I prefer the series ""What makes a . . .a . . .?"" by Muhlberger."
3,Zero gravity reading,"I didn't think this was a bad book. It just wasn't very in depth. Captain Schirra lightly hits on the areas that most readers would be most interested in . I would reccommend this book to those interested in the early space programs but only after you read such books as ""Moonshot"" by Alan Sheppard and Deke Slayton, et al. I know that test pilots, fighter pilots, and astronauts have to have a big enough ego to handle all the challenges they face, but sometimes Capt Schirra's ego gets in the way while reading ""Schirra's Space""."
2,A very disappointing book..................,"Not even factually correct in some cases.. as when Wally implies that he got the LLTV training cancelled because it was dangerous. Wrong !!! It was used through Apollo 17. I own over a hundred aviation and space books, but this one I gave to Good Will after I read it."
4,"A cocky, opinionated, American Hero","Wally Shirra doesn't lack for confidence. Then again how would a person, without the self confidence of a test pilot, strap himself to a rocket? A great insider's view of the program. However for all his confidence Shirra goes out of his way to not cast a single stone at the many people he crossed paths with through out his career. A class act. No new real information is uncovered through this book. Just a fun read."
4,An excellent biography from one of space's true pioneers,"Wally Schirra does an excellent job in giving his first hand account of the NASA program, missions, and astronauts. His opinions really open you up to some insightful thoughts about the space program and those who were involved in it. The book is a quick read and feels as if Wally is talking right to you as he bounces forward and backward in history through his numerous stories. And a plus, the book came autographed from Wally himself!"
4,A beginer's trail guide,An excellent work. The wide selection of readings alone would cost quite a bit of money to assemble seperately. Major contributions by each philospher are summarized in a non-technical manner that is accesible by readers from all walks of life. One of the few books that approaches several major themes under one cover and manages to leave the reader with the seeds of interest rather than confusion and massive generalization. I first ran across the work in class and it has remained a springboard for all manner of reading and writing. All in all an excellent grounding for further study.
4,i dont like anime exept this,"i hate all anime , the only exception is cowboy bebop, it is the only one i think has a point to it. and is not repeatative.and unlike others which is like a kids show with cussing bebop is very mature."
5,An Anime for Everyone,"How do I sum up a show like ""Bebop?"" ... From the unique musical score by genius Yoko Kanno to the well-written plotlines to the complex, sympathetic characters, this show ropes you in and refuses to let go. The voice acting, from anime veterans David Lucas, Wendee Lee and Beau Billingslea, among others, is some of the best I have heard in an anime; the voices seem natural and unforced. Also notable is the fact that ""Bebop"" simply oozes style--possibly the most I have seen in any show, animated or not. That does not, however, imply that ""Bebop"" is just another mindless action cartoon (cough, Dragon Ball Z, cough). Wantanabe (the director) has a keen grip on symbolism and metaphor a-la-""Matrix,"" so it felt like a breath of fresh air that I was thinking about the anime's themes long after finishing it. All in all, whether you're a seasoned otaku or a newbie curious about all the hype, this series is definitely a keeper."
5,The Best Damn Anime show out there,I'm not much on Anime but this is just so awesome not to resist. I love the characters and the plot. This is probbably the best price on all six sessions. [...]
5,Anime Rocks,"Cowboy Beboop is a fast paced, shoot them up series. It has humor, good animation, and great characters. This is one series that is better as a video than the books. You have to see the characters in action to appreciate it. Make sure your copy is legitimate and not an imitation. Licensed anime will have 4-5 episodes a disk and not 8-10 on a disk. Anime is Japanese cartoons and Manga is the book form for those who are new to either."
5,The Best and Unbeatable Anime of all Time!,"This set contains all 26 episodes of the best Anime(Japanese Animation) and doesn't quit. I have this set, and Have truly enjoyed it. I think that it is great because of the Action, the story and the villain. The overall story is about Spike Spiegal, Bounty Hunter in the year 2090 something(I believe) and is searching for Bounties, and his lost love Julia. He was part of a syndacite, and he ran away from it, and because of that his life is in danger. The series has breathtaking visuals, a good story excellent Jazz music backgrounds etc. The story is pretty sad if you ask me, but if you have Cartoon Network on your TV, and like Cowboy Bebop, then this is defenitly for you. It is worth the high price and more. The Special Features aren't great... It is also fun to listen to the Japanese dialoge to see what it was like in Japan. I highly recomend this. If you see them once, you're going to see them again."
5,"Cowboy Bebop, pure excellence","You're not really reading this are you? Surely you know Cowboy Bebop is excellent, you don't need me to tell you that...Cowboy Bebop is a true work of art. Complex, and well designed characters who bounce in and out of each others lives as their own needs demand. A fantastic, futuristic universe that's generally worn down and jaded, and seemingly full of criminals. Clever plotlines that are both short lived and for the moment, and long term and character developing at the same time. Incredible production values with a fantastic soundtrack, great art and animation, and a keen eye for composition and design. The english dub is actually pretty good too!Really, if you like anime, animation, sci-fi, or anything along those lines and have not seen this series then you should hang your head in shame. Then go and buy all six discs and enjoy, it's a great ride."
1,THIS 3-DVD SET IS A CRAPPY BOOTLEG,The real Cowboy Bebop Perfect Sessions DVD box set has 6 discs and a bonus cd. The 3-dvd sets floating around have compressed versions of the episodes which look like crap. The REAL box set is sadly out of print and rare and retailed for around $200. If you want the high quality version of Cowboy Bebop get each dvd separately for around $26 each.
5,GREAT ANIME.... GREAT DEAL,"This is an oportunity anime fans and especially Cowboy Bebop fans can't let pass...This series is great: the animation, the story, the carachter design and development and off course the music by Yoko Kanno... hopefully one day Amazon would offer a great deal with this incredible soundtrack..."
1,OUT OF STOCK - DON'T TRY TO ORDER,"Seventeen days after I placed my order for this boxed set, Amazon sent me the following post:""We are sorry to report that we will not be able to obtain the following item from your order: Shinichir( Watanabe (Director), et al 'Cowboy Bebop Complete Sessions Collection (Amazon.com Exclusive).' Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at this time.""Avoid being disappointed as I was. Don't try to order this boxed set."
2,Maybe worth it,"The photo is not of this item. The item here is a bootleg of the series. Its pretty good for the price. It IS a bootleg though, encoded in mpeg. there is occassional video artifacting and the audio is OK. Like i said, its good for the price, but if you can addord the real McCoy, buy it, you'll enjoy it more."
3,Tudor Ireland.,Ellis' book is too complex and extremely difficult to read. It certainly is not a good starting point for reading up on the Tudor History of Ireland. It contains absolutely no pictures or illustrations of any kind re-emphasing its difficulty.
3,Not a bad purchase,"It's described as an end table, but clearly it's a plant stand because of the dimensions. The brass accents are plastic rings that are not the same circumference as the legs, they fit but they stick out. I didn't use them anyway because they're plastic! The 3 legs are actually 6 pieces, 2 pieces make one leg. Two of the leg assemblies were straight enough, but the third leg due to the inaccurate drilling of the screw/hole portion of the leg assembly, is a bit crooked looking. Its pluses: it's all wood except for the base piece, and the top is solid marble, but I should add that it's only about 1/2"" thick, not as thick as it looks in the picture."
4,nice accent piece,"a little wobbly on carpet due to structure - rather tall and top heavy. but a cute little accent piece that goes perfectly in the vacant corner. Other than that, well made and easily assembled. Delivery was fast, but price wise I found it a little cheaper at Walmart!!"
1,Disappointed,"This was the 2nd purchase of this product for me. No problems the first time but this last one was sent to me broken. No way the broken piece occurred during shipping. The process for return of this product was and remains impossible. For the return troubles, I rate this product and its company poor."
4,Excellent!,The item was delivered on time and in the descibed condition. I would definitely shop with them again! Great card!
4,This is the Oasis by Miriam Moss,"""This is the Oasis"" follows in the vein of Miriam Moss's previous book, ""This is the Tree,"" about an African baobab tree. The book begins by looking at an oasis from a distance and detailing some common desert animals and phenomena as we move closer to the oasis itself. Once inside the oasis, author and illustrator show the inhabitants of the oasis, from fauna to humans. Every two page spread contains two concepts detailed in two stanzas and picked up in the illustrations. Each stanza begins with the phrase ""This is the place..."" which becomes wearisome, especially during a read aloud. The illustrations are colorful and appealing, making up for the text's deficiencies. The book serves well as a basic introduction to oasis living, but might inspire more questions than it answers. A short glossary at the end of the book expounds upon common desert names and terms, but still doesn't compensate for the slight, strained text of the bulk of the book."
2,Great design....SHODDY product,"I love(d) this wand. It is a great design, a real pleasure to use but..... I dropped mine into my lawn when the hose got tangled...it fell about 16 inches onto soft turf and broke. I took it back to the store I got it at and they replaced it with another since I didn't have the receipt to get a refund. This one the on/off switch has never worked accept for the time I was trying to figure out why the water stopped.... it turned itself off. The options at the top barely do what they say. I wouldn't keep this one if I didn't have to....If you're brave enough to try one.... KEEP YOUR RECEIPT"
3,"Great, when it works","This is a wonderful concept in a watering wand, with a long stem and a choice of three different watering sprays. It makes watering go faster and with its large head covers a large surface area while it sprays. However, I have had three of these wands fail because the plastic bolts at the neck crack and fall out. So, as I said, they're great when they work, but subject to failure."
2,Only A Few Good Songs,"Maybe he was too was messed up on coke or whatever... who knows. There are only 3 good songs on this album: Common Man, My Whole Life Ended & Walk Away From Love. It seems like after he did ""Walk Away From Love,"" which was produced by Van McCoy best known for ""Do The Hustle,"" he got carried away and did like 10 songs that mimick ""Walk Away From Love."" They are all on this album & none of them are any good, in my opinion. David Ruffin had one of the greatest voices of his generation, but as a soloist, he seemingly made bad creative choices and never had the good material to work with that he had with The Temptations."
4,real soul music,"the first eight tracks on this CD are absolutely great, the rest of it is David Ruffin doing disco, which is pretty weak. I'd buy it for the first few cuts on it, though. It's interesting to contrast this CD with the Eddie Kendrick's Ultimate Hits CD, because they WERE and always will be the two voices of the Temps."
5,IMMORTAL DAVID!!!!,If you want to get a great CD on David Ruffin this is the one.Every song on this album are classics and always will be.My favorite David Ruffin songs are...1.Walk away from love2.My whole world Ended(The moment you left me)3.I've lost everything I've ever loved4.Who I am5.Statue of a fool6.Rode by the place were we use to stay7.World of darknessThey should also play his solo songs more on the radio!!!!I think David is over looked as a solo artist.
2,He need the Group,"He had a wonderful voice but, he is not bigger than the group. This is a true saying. I love the originals Temptations. Had he song those songs with the other guys, it would have been fabulous."
4,Fables Not For Children,"A collection of eight short stories, presented in the guise of fanciful bed-time stories, but definitely not for impressionable kids. These are hard, pointed stories, stories with an edge, and the point each story tries to make is hammered home without much subtlety.One story portrays a future world where dreams are taxed. Another is a fictional account of a night in the life of Martin Luther King. Still another deals with sensitivity to other cultures. The last story, my favorite of the collection, explores the issue of what is true courage.Author Charles Johnson writes in an edgy, hard-bitten manner, sometimes trying just a little too hard. The stories are easy to read, in no sense polished or ""literary."" Each story shocks or disturbs, makes one think. That seems to be their purpose. I'm glad I read this little book. If you like adult fables and allegories, you may like this collection. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."
3,Good covered pot,"Pros: Keeps the micro explosions contained. Cheap price. Just a good micro covered plastic pot. Keeps some of the steam in.Cons: This not a ""pressure cooker"" by any definition of the word. It will boil over and seep out from under the lid if you fill it too much.Recommended for someone that just wants a covered micro pot with a secure lid, especially for dorm cooking where you can not have a real stove.I made beef stew with it and it took an hour and 45 min. My real pressure cooker does it in 50 min."
4,good steamer - handy - boils over sometimes,"This product is good to have but there are limits to usage.This boils over if you have to cook things too long, like rice andtapioca (use 5 minute brands) and if you make large portions with too much liquid. You have to watch it to catch it from boiling over.Works well to semi-steam vegetables with a some water and a lot of vegetables (like peppers and onions). Good size for microwave, stays in great condition, cleans easily and has no plastic taste. Great for reheating and goes from fridge to micro with no problem. Comes in handy and use it frequently."
3,Pressure Cooker in Disguise,"This is NOT a true pressure cooker. It is, however, useful for cooking rice and pasta for a meal. This is more of a steamer and will not tenderize meats like a real pressure cooker. For the money and what it does, it's handy and useful."
4,Time saving rice cooker,"I have been using this for 3 months now to cook our rice and I'll say that so far, this has served its purpose really well. First time I used this, I had to clean my microwave because the water from the steam all pooled into the microwave plate. I remedied this by putting this cooker into a shallow Anchor Hocking glass pie plate so all water collects on the plate, hence, no mess. Now, I can have hot, steaming rice in just a few minutes. My daughter, who's in college, uses it in her dorm. I've bought several for my friends and now they're all using this. I plan to buy several more."
1,need more info,"I would like to use the cooker more, but there was no recipe info or advice with it. I don't trust it enough to just ""wing it!"""
3,missing parts,It was a gift and it had missing part so they had to reoder parts so that was a big dissapointment when you gave a gift and it not all there!!
3,Not the best format for a cookbook,"The charming little format that makes the NYRB Classics series work so well for novels and memoirs actually works against this classic cookbook. The pages are so small and tightly bound that it's practically impossible to open this little paperback book open and cook from it: moreover, the publishers seemed to use a slightly different typeface for every single different preface David wrote for different editions of this book (all collected here) as well as for Wright's new foreword, which creates something of a headache.The book in and of itself is something of a marvel, though. Elizabeth David was one of the first British or American writers to popularize Mediterranean cooking at mid-century, and this, the first of her cookbooks, is a true classic: superbly written, it will leave you hungry to sample the dishes she describes and recommends."
5,Great book!,"I love Elizabeth David; I turn again and again to her books, as every dish I make seems to turn out fantastically!"
2,Arrived broken,"Table was late arriving and poorly packaged, marble top was chipped in 2 places. Too much of a hassel to return."
5,Nice table,"Table is exactly as pictured. Came in the mail undamaged. Easy to put together, didn't take much time at all."
5,Cherry Wood Plant Stand,"Cherry Finish Wood Square Style Plant Stand with Marble Table TopLove this table--it is the second one I have purchased. It is elegant-looking and seems far more expensive than the cost. It does need assembly, and that is quite easy. The marble tops may vary in their finishing, which is to be expected, so they will not be a perfect match. I use them as small individual-sized coffee table for guests and they complete my living room set beautifully."
5,Very nice,This item is very nice and looks pretty expensive. it was really easy to put together and i have gotten a lot of compliments on it. thanks for the on time delivery as well.
2,plantstand,"Adorable table, great price but marble top was split from one corner to the other. Terms for replacement too much for the price I paid."
2,Poor quality,Legs are crooked and 3 of the gold accent rings are cracked. I believe the able looks better in the picture.
2,Buyer Beware -- Looks Good in Photo but...,"Would be rated a one star if not for the sales price at the time.Key issue is quality control for the pre-assembled table. Legs come in two pieces that must be assembled with the pre-installed screws. However, because of the lack of precision in installing the screws by the manufacture, most legs when put together come out crooked. Also, the plastic gold rings are susceptible to breaking during assembly. Though the table looks good at a distance, it naturally is top heavy (stability issue) and upon seeing it closer the crooked legs become quite noticeable. Maybe the poor manufacturing is due to the XMAS holidays and a rush job for sales. Nevertheless, would not purchase this again.The remedy for the poorly manufactured table legs would be to buy one-piece wooden legs with screw assembly. That way, the crooked leg issue becomes a mute point."
4,"Well made, Like it. Smaller than thought","I like the bag, Its made of a sturdy canvas, but two things were not quite as expected. First, the bag has a rectangle footprint but the top simply folds over, IOW there is no sectioning called the top. If you were to look at it from the side it would appear A shaped when buckled closed. Its also way too small for my 10.5"" wide netbook to fit into the sleeve that's built inside the back of the bag. I guess thats for PDAs or cellphones or other gadgets. Doubt an ipad would fit either. But i will keep it and it will come in handy as a gadget holder or computer accessories bag. Guess I'm back on the hunt for a bag as sturdy as this with a slightly larger compartment for a netbook and a top that's the size of the bottom would be nice too."
4,Works Great w/ My PC 333,Never had a problem with the pads staying on. My sander is just under a year old so I suspect that over the years the base pad may wear down if there are problems with the Sandpaper staying attached.
2,Won't stay on my Porter Cable Sander,I also had problems with these staying on my Porter Cable Sander. These are the first I've had come off since I've had the sander(at least three years). I was going to order a new base but I guess I should try another brand first.
4,Lots & Lots!!,"Didn't really need all these, but it was such a ggod deal, I'll just have to find something to sand."
4,Great price for great product,"Seems to be quality paper. Haven't used this for long but so far I'm very happy. Much better than the local, high priced chain store."
5,EVERYTHING YOU NEED,THIS BOX OF SANDING DISCS HAS A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF SANDING GRITS. IT ALLOWS TO SAND TO A VERY FINE FINISH. IT HAS AMPLE AMOUNT OF SANDING DISCS.
5,Only Hours Away from a Fun Filled Latin/Merengue Night,"I bought this book based on the strong recommendation from a previous reviewer who heralded joy and success they had dancing the Merengue. They were absolutely on the money!! It was simple, so very simple, to follow the basic body movements with the accommodating and accompanying foot placements. The book was certainly cheaper than even a group class but more importantly much more convenient. The author, Jeff Allen, correctly states in the book, ""read my book aloud and you have the feeling of having me right in the room with you."" We already owned the all time favorite party song Hot, Hot, Hot, the author suggested to use as our first Merengue and once we caught on the rest of the evening was spent with Merengue and Sangria. Thanks for the instructive review and of course to Jeff Allen's book Quickstart to Social Dancing!"
1,My first book return to Amazon!,"I ordered this book from Amazon based on the raving reviews I had read on the site. What a disappointment! Not only does this book take the reader for a moron, but it is poorly written, poorly illustrated and overall very unprofessionally designed. It gives the impression that a student took notes while Mr. Allen was teaching and thought that was good enough for publication! I have been looking for a good book on social dancing, to no avail so far. I am used to software books that include a CD and such a presentation would seem a natural for a book on dancing. I could envision a book with a CD of clearly ""tempoed"" music, maybe with a few minutes of the teacher counting the beats at the beginning of each track. Is that so hard? Anyboday who wants to comment on this is welcome to e-mail me."
1,Absolutely Useless,"Don't bother to buy this. The instructions are like trying to read a translation from Japanese assembly instructions for some incomprehensible machine. I was totally unable to translate his instructions into any usefull movement. For example he says, ""With both your elbows pointing 45 digrees at the dance floor relax your underarms and push the upper arms up by flexing all the muscles that surround the front, side, and back of your rib cage."" I don't know about you but this instruction is useless for me.I am currently using this book as a hot-pad in my kitchen."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"Although this book is clearly written, it contains no pictures and virtually no diagrams. If you can learn dance steps without pictures and diagrams, more power to you. I found this book to be useless."
1,Non dancers will remain non dancers if they read this book,"This book is a total waste of time for anyone wanting to learn social dancing. Get the complete book on Ballroom dancing if you need instructions that make sense, and it gives you some history also. I rarely write comments on anything, but this book bugged me to no end. Yuck. One of the few books I've ever sent back."
2,Out of step,"I bought this book, the VHS tape ""Bring Back the Romance of Dance"" and have taken introductory ballroom dance classes locally with my wife. The tape instruction and the local instruction matched perfectly. This book, Quickstart to Social Dancing, has a nice introduction then finally begins with foxtrot instruction on page 47. This is where I downgrade the book. The foxtrot half box steps suggested in this book do not even come close to matching the tape foxtrot instructions or the instruction in our local dance classes. One would think that a dance like the foxtrot would have universally recognized steps. I fault the book for not mentioning that their instruction is different.It is my conclusion to learning to dance takes practice, practice, practice. No matter. Learning to dance is fun."
2,Skip this one.,"I'm an avid fan of MZB, but this book just didn't make the cut. It's attempts to link book events to real life and other books are just tedious. And it follows a relatively stable character across decades in which he just doesn't change. Pick up a different MZB book -- you'll be happier."
2,Heartlight,"Marion Zimmer Bradley tells a good story, but is a graceless writer. She (and we) could have benefited greatly from a strong editor.This novel is particularly distracting because it is so filled with avoidable, mundane errors. (What happened to the copy editor?) For instance, the hero is described as age 19 during WWII, ""barely old enough to vote"". Well, readers, the voting age wasn't lowered to 18 for another 30 years. Joe Kennedy Sr. is described as a senator (he wasn't); and Bradley's knowledge of NYC geography is faulty, to be kind. She has Bellevue on the lower east side, near the Brooklyn Bridge; an address in the East 30's as ""just off Sixth Avenue""; and describes 8th Street and Broadway as on the West side. I can only imagine the errors on the subjects that I don't know as well.I urge the publishers to have copy editors, proofers and researchers correct the worst of these mistakes before the next printing."
3,Not what I expected,I picked up this book because it was co-written by a favorite author of mine (even though she isn't given credit on the cover) and was a bit disappointed. I thought the book's style was too much MZB and not enough bes Shahar.
2,This book is majorly confusing!,"The book constantly refers to obscure, out of print books. I felt as if there was more to each section than the plot told."
1,Not worth buying.,[....]Here is a profession book review which I totally agree with. Considering the background of the author you can imagine what kind of value you can get from this book (and the chiral drugs book). You can get more information from a free Aldrich Catalog for sure.
5,great,I keep a stock of these to give as Christmas party house gifts. Would recommend to anyone who does the same
5,happy and sparkly,who wouldnt love a brightly lit bendable little tree? it reminds me of the charlie brown christmas tree. I bought two and flanked my kitchen window with them and enjoyed them every night. worth the money and they are happy and funky
2,Lights,"I purchased two of these trees, one did not wok!!! Disappointing when you gift it to someone and get the message ity did not work!"
2,Complete disappointing live!,"Awful! I have a lot of live material of 92 tour and it's far better. I was expecting only for better sound, and I had only this. No soul, no inspiration, no exhibition. Aerosmith was a really good rock and roll band, but they don't have to play the songs the same way tan in studio: This is live, folks! If you play the same songs the same way, the studio versions are much better. And don't talk about the amount of ballads in a rock and roll live CD... Please, liberate Aerosmith and return to the exhibition of the great voice of Tyler, and the personal solos of Perry. So this is a live CD: demonstrate your power, your soul and your rythm and blues."
4,"Piper shows that faith looks forward, not backward","John Piper sets aside the notion that faith looks back on what God has done in the past. Faith looks toward the future at what God is going to do, not just at what He has done. This dispells fear, anxiety, shame, and all other emotions that pop psychology embraces and shows us where our hope lies. This is a rich, liberating book on how a sovereign God works through His Son, Jesus Christ. It is ""faith in future grace"" that gives us hope."
3,Beautiful,I purchased this for an online music appreciation class & didn't think I'd enjoy it much but I ended up really loving it. It helped me appreciate music more. It was shot really well.
4,An Inspiring Christian Read,Enough friendships and recipes to bring five Christian women together to form an alliance to be there for each other through various tribes and tribulations.
2,Lost Potential,"Being a local author, I was excited about new talent. The basis of the book had potential, but honestly I felt it never quite reached it. The characters were well-drawn but sometimes ran together, I believe because they were not well defined enough in the beginning. Some of the stories were very touching and you could almost feel their pain...almost. I think this author is too young to be compared to Anne Rivers Siddons, she's just not in that ballpark as of yet. However, I will read her next effort because I believe this author will get better in time."
4,Wholesome and Sweet,"A lovely story that is simple and fun. If you would like a short tale that is heart warming and makes you understand the values that you hold throughout life in regards to friendship read this quaint story. Friendship Cake was a nice escape from the not so innocent books that we all read, just a real pleasent book."
4,Friendship Cake: A Novel,I read the book to use for our church bookclub. I enjoyed this short novel more than I thought I would. I would definitely recommend it for a all women bookclub!!
3,"Tasty, But Not Enough Icing","""Friendship Cake"" is a nice Christian fiction book about a group of Methodist women getting together to create a church cookbook. The characterizations are well done with the group evolving into special friends. The book has been compared to the Mitford Series, and I did not find it to be so. Every book taking place in the south and having a church as its background does not a Mitford book make. The book lacks the sparkling characters, dialogue and for the most part deep-down warmth that the Mitford series brings us. However, by book's end I found myself just getting to know the characters and liking them. I would like to see a sequel to ""Friendship Cake"" with the same cast."
4,Transports Me To The Time Of The Ancient Celts,"Jayne Elleson's beautiful voice and Philip Riley's soothing and uplifting music combine in this marvelous effort. Songs like ""Come Silver Moon"" and ""Pictish Girl"" brings to the forefront of the imagination a moonlit night of stunning beauty. Songs like ""Sanctus"" and ""Breton Drum"" stir great energy within, and awakens the Celtic spirit in everyone. For a long time this CD was hard to find, but now it seems to be everywhere. This is your chance to own this great release."
4,Hidden Gem,"I read the reviews here and decided to try this CD. It's 12 melodies sounds similar when first hear. However when I listen repeatly, I can feel the movements of each pieces and they are all brilliant ! Jayne's voice matches the tones perfectly. I like Philip's arrangements and the intellegent in well choose of each instrument. If you enjoyed Enya I am sure you will not disappointed with the blessing tree. Maybe find it more beautiful and richer than any musics of same style you every knew."
