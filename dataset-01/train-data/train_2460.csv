5,Keep Bleeding,"This is an incredible CD...it mixes sounds soo well, with the hard punk sound of the title track and then on into their familiar ""don't call it emo"" style of rock...Buy this CD!"
3,Not that good,"I bought this CD because of the single 'Sweetness'. Since I knew 'Bleed American' and 'The Middle' were OK songs, I went and bought this CD. It wasn't really what I expected, the rest of the CD sounds very pop, and I couldn't find another good song. I only give this CD a 3 star rating because of the song 'Sweetness', which I think it's an awsome song. Don't buy it if you think the rest of the CD will be ad good as it."
4,J.E.W. rocks,Its great JEW(Jimmy Eat World) is finally being recongized you hamay not know they have been around for quite some time their new CD Bleed America (that is what i was called when i bought it) is very different from their previous albums it seems to be lacking that emo sound from the others and is more of a rock pop with a slight dash of emo stuck in it. Thats the only way they could get thier songs on the radio i guess. However i still adore this album. It spoke to me I woudl recommend it for any one who feels like they are an outsider or just wants some good thoughtful tunes instead of the normal love/hate ballads on the radio. It spent about a month in continuous rotatoin in my CD player hopeful it will in yours too!
5,Awesome,Most teens (or adults) would like this CD. I bought it for my teen and find myself borrowing it!
3,decent,"I enjoyed the album ""Clarity"" much more in this album. It might be because they were unknown and now they have a place on MTV (which I despise). Lyrically there are some good things happening in this album but instrumentally this album didn't seem innovative. The music took a step to the poppy side, which is not for me. If you're looking to buy a Jimmy Eat World album I recommend ""Clarity."""
5,JEW... BAND OF YOU DREAMS,WOW! That is all I can say about the CD! Jimmy Eat World kicks some serious [rear] with this CD! They have found a way to blend hard songs like Bleed American with sweet and heart felt songs like Your House! They have totally hooked me! Yum! Thier CD Clarity is also great too! So I recommend this highly! Let JEW rock your [rear] off!! :o)
4,"Emotional, passionate, and hard rockin'...","Over the Christmas holiday, I watched the video for the ""The Middle"" on MTV at my parents' place. Liking what I saw, I went out and bought their CD on a whim. And the verdict is this is a pretty darn good record for four lads from Arizona! The songs are a mixture of power-pop, punk, and ballads. ""The Middle"" and ""If You Don't, Don't"" are good examples of power-pop songs while ""Hear You Me"" and ""My Sundown"" are earnestly powerful ballads. Quite simply, there is not one stinker on this CD. You get 45 minutes of sheer listening pleasure. If you like Weezer or Blink 182, give these guys a try. Honestly speaking, this record is even better than Weezer's Green Album!"
3,It kind of depends...,"This is a pretty good CD for anybody who's not picky about their rock, but it gets kind of tiresome after a while and you lose interest in the novelty of the songs. I bought this last August and absolutely loved it for a while, but I eventually stopped listening and sold it off to a record exchange this afternoon. This certainly isn't a disc for somebody who hates ""pop-y [music],"" but you'll just have to see for yourself."
5,Jimmy Eat World,"This album is fabolous. The music is smooth from start, to finish with the rough quitar licks. Jimmy Eat World is genius, .... This music is so fresh and original, if your looking for a real rock n' roll band, cope this album!!!"
5,!PRIMA!,Jimmy Eat World is sooooo great! Bleed American is an incredebly beautiful cd and i can't stop listening to it. I listen to this cd every night and its on repeat all night. I became so obsessed that it makes me sad when i don't listen to it. They are second only to one (nirvana because its nirvana) although Jimmy Eat World has the most beautiful songs i have ever heard any one who doesn't have this cd is really missing out!
5,"Simply, A Must","I was filled with hesitation upon the purchase of Bleed American. I have spent the past year or so drawn to Clarity. The CD has been on repeat in my changer because of the amazing and truly unique sound this band has. When I heard the new CD was out, I was worried that it would prove to be nothing like Clarity, and that it would shatter my concept of Jimmy. The second I turned on Bleed American, my skin got goosebumps and I cranked it. Jimmy Eat World has done it again. The tracks ""Cautioners"", ""My Sundown"", ""Your House"", and ""Hear you me"" are all emotional masterpieces. Stunning. Perhaps you are in the mood for something faster? Listen to ""Bleed American"", ""Sweetness"", or ""A Praise Chorus"" all of which are perfect for singing along with, and really getting into. I truly cannot say enought about this record. If you like ANY type of music, or have any sort of musical inclination, you will need to get this album. I guarantee you will be satisfied."
5,Please help. I can't get this out of my CD player.,"I am a newcomer to Jimmy Eat World, but seeing as this album was inexpensive and made the lead review of Rolling Stone I thought I'd give it a try. Simply put, this is the best rock album all year, and this has been a really good year. Why buy Weezer's album of 30 minutes at full price when you can buy BLEED AMERICAN which just kicks Weezer all over the room?Standout tracks are ""Praise Chorus,"" ""The Middle,"" ""Hear You Me"" (John Hughes or Cameron Crowe would have killed to put this in one of their movies), and ""Authority Song."" But really, every song on this is great. This CD is sans filler.Imagine. A rock album without poop jokes. Buy this now."
1,Not Even Worth The Price!,"I just feel bad giving out 0 stars for simply the effort to produce an album. Anyway, I agree with the ""Tripe"" review. It was on my cd player for exactly 3/4 of it's length, and is now collecting dust behind my bookshelf where it landed after I winged it across the room."
2,Pretty Bad,"I don't how describe it there are a couple good songs like Bleed American, A Praise Chorus, and The Middle. But they rest is just horrible. besides the first 3 songs there's no trace of punk rock through out the whole CD if you like punk rock dont get this CD."
4,A Praise Chorus for Jimmy Eat World,"Despite the teeny-bop bubble-gum rock tag that has unfairly been placed on the band, Jimmy Eat World's first release is definitely worth a listen. Not far from the original mid-90's Weezer sound, the tracklist bounces around from up-tempo, catchy rock songs (""A Praise Chorus"", ""If You Don't, Don't"") to melodious, darker ones (""Hear You Me"", ""My Sundown""). ""Your House"", an uptempo acoustically-driven track, is one of the highlights, and ""Authority Song"" is a clever and harmonious throw-back to rock songs of yore. Where teenage girls may become frustrated that the album isn't chock full of ""The Middle"" clones, alternative rock fans will be pleasantly surprised by the band's range and depth. Don't let MTV's TRL fool you...Jimmy Eat World isn't out to sell records to the Backstreet crowd, they're out to make good rock music. So far, so good."
5,A Good Comeback,"""Bleed American"" was easily one of the best CD's of 2001 and is still a contender one year later. ""Bleed American,"" ""The Middle,"" and ""Sweetness"" have all received their fair share of radio play. Those who own the CD, however, realize that most all of the tracks could be radio-worthy. A real gem from this CD is ""Cautioners,"" which has a memorable score and a refreshing breath of air. ""Clarity"" was a mediocre CD by J.E.W., but they have really started to pick up popularity since their first album nearly ten years ago."
4,Superb,"""Bleed American"" or rather ""Jimmy Eat World"" was my first album by Jimmy Eat World. I had heard -and loved- ""The Middle"" and ""Bleed American"" on the radio and went out and bought the album.At first, I have to say I was shocked. I was expecting more of a hardcore sound such as in ""Bleed American"", but Bleed American turned out to be the heaviest track on the CD. Nonetheless, I was impressed. Their music is uplifting and cheerful, with a punkish sound... the very definition of Emo. Tracks such as ""Hear You Me"" (sporting lyrics such as ""may angels lead you in"") were relaxing on a stressful day, while ""Bleed American"" and ""The Sweetness"" (which they just released on the radio) keep me pumped.In short words, Jimmy Eat World is pure Emo talent"
5,"Dude, this CD is worth so much more than I paid....","Two of my friends had this CD and I had never really listened to it until the other night when I fell in love with it. Their words really speak out to you. One of the songs, ""Hear You Me,"" is truly beautiful. It almost makes you want to cry, especiually knowing the background of the song. Their other songs are wonderful too. My favorite song to jam to in the car is ""If You Don't Don't."" They are such an awesome band and have A LOT of talent."
4,Jimmy Eat World's best.,"Jimmy Eat World's latest effort ""Bleed American"" is a matured, musical piece from their previous ""Clarity."" Though only the first two tracks ""Bleed American"" (potential hit single) and ""A Praise Chorus"" are fast-paced, punk-rock, the rest of the album is satisfying to its ears, with mid-tempo beats and more polished guitar licks."
4,This is wonderful.,"I am a huge fan of Jimmy Eat Worlds music and needless to say, I was looking forward to this release for a very long time. And I'm proud to say that it lives up to the hype that it's gotten. While, in my opinion, it isn't as beautiful and memorable as Clarity(their classic), I do believe it comes very close. Just listen to the emotion that circulates through songs like ""Hear You Me"" and ""My Sundown"". Amazing. Every song is great and I've got to give them credit for being true to themselves by doing what they want. Get Clarity and then get this! Bye emo friends."
2,Huge step backwards,"Absolutely not as good as Clarity, this album sounds like it was designed to get play on TRL and corporate rock radio. Look at the video for The Middle - teenagers in their underwear. I wonder what market-savy executive decided on that motif! The songs are simplistic, the lyrics are innane, and the only ambition seems to be please the largest possible number of listeners. I regreted buying this album almost immediately. Possibly the biggest dissipointment of 2001 (Weezer's green album being another contender)."
3,It's a good effort,"Sweetness and The middle are definitely the best songs, I don't like any of the other ones though. Maybe after the catchiness of these it's hard to cope with the rest of the album for me. When I first heard Sweetness I thought it was an 80's song, not that that's bad, but it just wasn't too 'new' of a sound, which goes for the rest of the album that doesn't have the catchiness to constitute being listened to repeatedly.I have 'Clarity' too, and it isn't as good as Bleed American imho."
2,These posers take over mtv,"I hate this music industry, and this a long with hoobastank, disturbed, linkin park is taking over the radio adn ruining everyones life"
4,"Bleed American, Bleed Quality","Okay so sadly I had never heard of Jimmy eat world until I saw the video for in the middle. But after picking this cd up I was pleasently surprised at the quality of this group, sweetness, and other tracks on this cdhave their own unique special flavor that is definately worth the 15 bucks.."
5,Awe inspiring CD. I loved it.,"I am not what you would call a music connoisseur, but listen. This is one of the best CDs I have ever heard. Upbeat when it needs to be, slow when you need a break. Well mixed and hard to hate, this is a definate in any rock fans collection. Poetic lyrics and catchy tunes, I love this album. Rock on, Jimmy Eat World, rock on!"
4,Rollicking Summer Fare,"This is delicious, if sometimes vapid listening. That is, a perfect summer time record. Aside from the ballads (which verge on awful at times), this is tuneful proto-rawk at its finest. Harmonized choruses, meaty riffs, rich production. All of the necessary ingredients are there. The tenth track is just about the most instantly hummable song I've heard this summer: Updates Mellencamp with handclaps, clever phrasing and female backup singers who are threaded in expertly to give it just the right punch. Apart from the syrupy, overearnest ballads, this is a solidly fun record that I've been spinning for about two weeks without fatigue."
3,bra,"This bra adds a lot to my bust, however, it doesn't fit as good as I had hoped. I went through the proper fitting methods and it still saggs a bit at the top making a definate line. It is also really quite heavy due to it being filled with water. I think Air would be a better solution. If it fits better for others, then this would be great."
5,I love this bra,I love this bra it is so comfortable that I forget I have it on. It is so hard to find bras that feel good while wearing them & the liguid that is in this one make it feel even more natural so that it moves with you & not against you. I now have 2 of these & plan to get a lot more I am really hopig that they don't ever stop making these. It is made of good sturdy material that I can tell won't wear out with only a few washings (though I don't think I would try to put this one in the dyier). I can say that I will be stocking up on these while I can. Theyare just that good. The straps don't slide either.
2,Historical narrative disguised as a cookbook,"Clearly the author fell in love with Sicily; I do not fault him for that. Secondly, indeed the food of Sicily is marvelous, fresh and a combination of ingredients which reflect its diverse ethnic history over centuries. However, the author's recipes are ponderous because he really wants to give detailed history of the embattled island of Sicily over two thousand years. Either write an historical essay or a cookbook. I don't think this author made up his mind as to which avenue he was pursuing: historical or culinary. There are a couple of simple recipes I am tempted to try; however, most of them are difficult and many ingredients are impossible to find, here in the meatloaf/mashed potatoes Midwest."
1,poor quality,these cartridges are not like the standard type. Don't waste your money. They will not fit the fax and theyleak.
3,Please read before you buy.,"The introduction in the beginning of the bible is amazing. It has a brief guide to each version of the bible which is unbiased. It has charts, a complete breakdown of the scriptures, character studies, dictionary, and even a soulwinners guide. The intoruction to each book is not overglammoured it is brief and helpful. It even gives you a breakdown of the book Part 1 part 2 ect. However, the pictures (art) in this book are rather disgusting and vile (homosexual) I want to take them out without ruining the bible itself. Not only that but it gives a quick bio on each artist that in my opinion is both useless information and somewhat a lie about some of the authors. It is to be a holy book I don't want ot see naked people and I can't let my children look at it is lascivious, lewd, and disgusting which is preached against in the bible. The best picture is the picture of the Pentacost absolutley amazing I want a personal copy of this painting."
2,Nothing New,"I really didnt learn anything new. Was surprized that in the healthy eating info. all items: ie.. brocolli...and soy products were listed as healthy eating. these are only two things in a varied list of food items to Avoid for thyroid patients. In fact all cruciferous vegetables are to be avoided. even cooked goiterous foods, brocolli, califlower, spinash, brussel sprouts are not 100% good for a compromised thyroid and should be eaten sparingly. and ALL soy products are bad. So why list these as healthy foods in a book that people are buying because of thyroid problems. but i liked the idea of combining the natural t3 dessicated porcine or bovine thyroid supplements with the synthetic prescription t4 synthroid. this will supply the t4 that possibly isnt being 100% converted by the t3."
2,So so,Was not exactly what I was looking for. I was hoping for more information on alternatives other then medication. I am currently on synthroid however it has caused bone lose was hoping for other methods to control my under active thyroid
5,This is the thyroid book you'll re-read,"When I was diagnosed with Grave's disease (hyperthyroid), I read several books on thyroid function. This book is by far the most complete reference. The book explains in detail many of the subjects that other books gloss over. It also contains the most complete discussion of T3 that I've seen.Now that I'm taking anti-thyroid medication and I've reached a stable level, I'm still reading the book and finding out things I wasn't told. For example, 50% of people gain weight when they start taking anti-thyroid drugs. This would have been helpful for me to know.For how common thyroid problems are, there seems to be a real problem with correct diagnosis and treatment. In a world of managed care, you need the information in this book."
2,The Thyroid Solution,"Not what I expected - but price was fair -I doanated it to our local library. Iexpected a more natural approach to spotingand dealing with a thyroid imbalance, I didnot expect a 'go to your doctor' book."
5,"Finally, a dr stating that LAB values do NOT make you well!","I have been treated for hypothyroid for over 30 years.For the last SEVERAL years I have been to the doctor over and over, as well as to different doctors, telling them that I feel like I did when I was first diagnosed. They would point at my labs and say I was fine. I had one doctor lower my medicine levels and brag that he had people leave his practice because he would not raise their medication levels!! At last, Dr. Arem validates my belief that there IS more that can be done. This book is particulary valuable if you have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia! The best and healthiest patients are the ones that are armed with knowledge about their condition!! Thank you Dr. Arem."
2,The Thyroid Solution,I was very disappointed in this book. Didn't feel that I learned anything that I didn't already know.
3,The Thyroid Solution,"This book is ok, but the paper and binding are poor. It seems to be printed with the cheapest materials and I was not pleased with that."
5,Finally,I have suffered from a thyroid condition for 15 of my 30 years. Finally there is book that discusses the mental problems that are associated with this problem. The doctors that I have seen for this condition are only interested in the labs results. Now I have the knowledge to help myself as well as help my doctor to help me. This is a must read for anyone that suffers from a thyroid condition.
1,Not as expected,"This book was rated as being ""like new"" but it was not. The dust cover was fine, but inside the pages did not look new, but worse, there were a number of pencil markings on several pages, and on a couple of the questionnaires the numbers had been filled in by a previous reader. I would never have purchased this book if I had known it was like this. Whoever rated it must have just looked at the cover and not on the inside."
5,The BEST Resource on the Topic I have Read,"I have been searching for a good resource on the topic of thyroid for many years. The Thyroid Solution is excellent. I intend to encourage all the people visiting my own web site to get this book. It is a rare blend of good science and down to earth, practical recommendations. Read it, take a copy to your doc and start making sense of how thyroid fits into your own equation."
2,Likes to toot his own horn,"This author promises to provide the solution, but really doesn't present anything new. Likes to talk about how good he is. Does provide some helpful information about diet and exercise, but covered this in one chapter."
5,Thyroid book,I received the book very fast and it was just as I thought it would be. I would order from them again
4,Thyroid Solution,"The whole process went smoothly, which is the norm for my orders with Amazon.com. The book came quicker than posted and was in the condition listed in the posting."
2,not really helpful,"Not really helpful. Unless you can get your doctor to read this book, or at least listen to you."
4,good information,I am changing my original review because I bought two books and reviewed the wrong one. I bought this book after managing Hashimotos disease for 20 years. I was not having success communicating with my doctor to get my body feeling right and I thought I might find some answers here. It has a LOT of information.
2,Thyroid Solution,"I was disappointed in this product because it didn't reveal any information that couldn't be found already published in magazines. I guess if you didn't know anything about thyroid then it would be helpful but I'm pretty informed about this subject thru my daughter, husband and aunt all having it was really hoping I would find more solutions to help them with their thyroid."
2,Limbo,I'm still in limbo on this product... I got the first one and it shocked the horses... I've sent it back and will try another... Maybe this one will work correctly ..
4,No more back breaking!!,I ordered this heater for my mom who is now taking care of my ponies while I am away. I herniated a disc in my lower back 2 winters ago chopping at the frozen ice in the water trough. I don't know why we didn't get this sooner! My mom texted me that she was so thankful to not have to chop ice this morning!! The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that she could not get the water to stop leaking once installed. She used some glue (or something) to get it to stop leaking. The trough is a rubbermaid and should be compatible. Not sure why they leak.
3,Not the Best of the West . . . or of Emmylou,"I'm a big Emmylou fan, but this cd was a disappointment. Her more recent western songs, like ""Ballad of a Runaway Horse"" from _Cowgirl's Prayer_ and ""My Antonia"" from _Red Dirt Girl_, are far superior than any on this cd. The one thing I like about this cd is that I can put it in my cd player with other western cds and put it on random play without breaking the cowpoke mood (except fot the unfortunate pinball machine in Amarillo), which doesn't work with her other cds with their more southern flavor. Still, I might have used the money more wisely elsewhere, on some other Emmylou album or some other western cd."
3,only half the size stated,"Title: Hotpoint Electronic Toy WasherQuantity: 1Sold by: DGG4, Inc.Condition: newReason: Different from website descriptionReturn Details: False Info -ad says dimensions 25""x21""x30""; actual product maybe half that size - more like 15x10x12. I ordered this to go with a kitchen; after looking I went with this one BECAUSE OF THE DIMENAction Requested: RefundFalse Info -ad says dimensions 25""x21""x30""; actual product maybe half that size - more like 15x10x12."
1,Total Washout,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas. When I opened the box and saw that it was half the size of what was advertised, I was disappointed. The real test will be Christmas morning when my daughter sees it. If there are tears it's going back. I ordered it because of the dimensions listed. It was easily half the size, and not worth the cost either."
4,Nice and realistic,"My son loved it. I bought it from an off-line store so we didn't have any size issues that other reviewer experienced. It was great- realistic, work just as similar as real washer with great sound. My son put his socks and turn it on himself from when he become 15 month old.(Now he is 2)Sadly, It broke just 2 monthes after that. I decided to buy another one for his christmas present- We know he'll love it again."
1,Total Scam,This is absolutely a sellers scam. the dimensions listed on the website are completely false. The actual toy is about 1/5 the size advertised and a complete rip off. I returned mine the minute it arrived.
1,So obvious !!!!,"Written by the master minds of the wars in the Balkans namely the Serbian Academy of Science and Art, of course the Noel Malcolm's is not a favorable one... because Noel's book talks the truth and not lies that the Serbian Academy of Science and Art use to feed the world with."
5,Welcome Back Jo,"Let Me Be The One is a wonderful, romantic, very steamy book, the first in a set of 4. Lord Northam is a very strong, virile leading man, and Elizabeth is smart, witty and strong woman. Together they make an unbeatable pair, as Lord and Lady Batteman find out. I can't wait for South, East and West's stories. I hope Lady Sophia, who we have yet to meet, shows up soon."
2,get it from a library don't buy it,"Elizabeth is a modern woman with modern views, the fact that she called herself a whore and still held a trace of innocence is not believable that first kiss tells you all. It is 150 pages too long.If you like steamy sex scenes this book has plenty."
5,Older edition,"This is a very good book of knowledge about bees. A must for anyone that is going to be a beekeeper. Unfortunately I purchased an edition that is around 20 years old. While still a lot of good information, there are a lot of new data and changes to information about bees in 20 years."
1,Huh?,"I find it interesting that more people reviewed this album than some of the RHCP's other albums. Maybe because pretty boy Navarro took his head out of his rear end long enough to play guitar on it...but I digress. 4 words...""No John? No Way."""
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM,"This is the worst chili peppers cd. With Dave Navarro on guitar, the whole band blows."
1,not even worth downloading...,"all the bio info about this album is true, what they leave out is that it's terrible. anthony keidis has always been relatively weak as a participant, and this album forces his lyrics to the front on over charged multi layered guitar driven boredom trips. none of the playfulness, dynamics or spirit from blood sugar is here. if there is any resembling their early music it's that this album sounds really undeveloped. thank goodness john returned for californication, which, while not a return to form of 91 chili peppers (who needs to stay 8 years behind yrself?) is a great step forward. narvarro belongs in hollywood bars playing boring rock music and re-uniting with janes addiction for the 15th time."
3,"This album is pretty good, but not wonderful","I wouldn't recommend this cd to anyone who hates techno, heavy metal and a little rap all mixed together. Dont get me wrong, its a great album, but Dave Navarro really screwed it up. I went to the HFStival on the 29th, the Chili Peppers sucked. It's all the new guitar player's fault. Flea rocked on the bass, i mean his fingers were moving so fast, i could hardly see them!! The band need a good guitarist though."
5,A little bit poppy,RHCP will always rock. This album is more like the one you put because you know every word then because you are in a real music mude. The illastrations are adorable. Give a real listen to Tear Jerker and Falling into Grace. The love songs dominate this album.
3,not their best but still good,"One Hot Minute is a decent album with songs great songs like coffe shop and pea, but doesn't really match the intensity of the red hot chilli peppers like their other albums do. There was a lot of internal striff in the band while the band was making the album whcih probably makes the album sound the way it does. In the end, one hot minute may not be their best album, but it good for those seeking to get the full spectrum of the red hot chilli peppers."
3,Not the best album but some good tracks,"I can't say I was overly impressed when this album came out. Something was missing. The 2 fantastic albums with John showed to me they had found their perfect line up. I think with Dave they went in an interesting step in the wrong direction. Don't get me wrong, I am also a fan of Janes Addiction, but this union did not work for me. However there are some really good tracks on here: Coffeeshop, My Friends and the best of the album, Deep Kick."
3,Not the same band,"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are without a doubt my favorite band, and as such, it is hard to admit that I don't recommend this album to fans. Whether due to the absence of pivotal guitarist John Frusciante, the addition of intermedial replacement Dave Navarro, or just a lack of band chemistry, this record has little unity and even less harmony. The Peppers' sound tends to change with each cd they produce, but in my opinion, this is the only one that is not an improvement. Though numbers like ""Aeroplane,"" ""Shallow Be Thy Game,"" and ""My Friends"" are nice, catchy songs, they are not up to the band's level of play. This album is worth a listen and maybe even a purchase just for the sake of owning it, but for a sample of the real Chili Peppers, I would turn to Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication, By The Way, or Stadium Arcadium, because this record just doesn't show the band in the light they deserve."
3,Cushioned By Better Albums,"While this is an excellent album in its own right, i just don't think Dave Navarro was suited to the Chilis sound which had been cemented with BSSM. It contains some strong material but tends to fade towards the end. If you are new to the Chilis, you would be better off checking out BSSM, undoubtedly one of the albums of the decade or, the recent Californication, which returns to that winning band line-up. That said, you could do a lot worse!"
2,PUH-LEEZE,"Com'on let's be real this CD was luke worm--to alright. The band is just WAY stronger with John back...better songs, compositions, chemistry. With By the Way there is just more beautiful variation. Here they are lost and Navarro does not mesh with the band at all.........dave keeps on repeating himself and is in the end just a heavy metal type guitar slinger..."
4,Play it multiple times for true enjoyment.,"When I first bought this album I would have been on board with those RHCP fans who were disappointed with it. It certainly is a very different album for them, and as discussed in previous reviews, this is because of Dave Navarro's apperence as lead guitarist. This may have been a sort of culture shock to die hards who wanted the standard RHCP sound. However upon repeated listens ( which I'm sure some fans haven't done ) this album is actually VERY GOOD. If you are considering buying it and you own BSSM or Mother's Milk and expect more of the same you too will be disappointed. It still sounds like the Peppers with Anthony K. & Flea, but the funk is less visible and replaced with more rock. This however does not make it a bad album. Unless you feel the bands you like should never expierment and therefore NEVER GROW."
4,Better Than Expected,"Listening to this album for the first time in literally 13 years, I am shocked at how much I enjoy it. I remember liking this early on in High School, but as with a lot of things I enjoyed back then, I imagined it not holding up over the years. Plus, since then, I've stopped enjoying Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their most famous and (at least on Rate Your Music) most highly rated album.This album has little of the funk that ended up boring me with Blood Sugar Sex Magik, just enough to keep the sound interesting. Instead, it has a lot of the fuzzy guitars that were prevalent in mid-90's Alternative music. The songs are quirky, the sound changes from track to track, and the album is almost heavy at times. It has an enjoyable experimental feel to it.I was intending to listen to this album as a trip down memory lane, but I think I'm going to put it on a semi-regular rotation."
2,This was hot for only about a minute,"2 1/2Perhaps not their absolute worst material (there still seems to be more fire involved on the whole then their extremely competent though mostly lobotomized current work) , but probably the disc with the biggest identity crisis. There are many less-then-funky choices going on here which keep this album from even becoming uniformly good, dragging these sessions down into noisy creative conflict instrumentally at odds with each other."
5,Perfect.,"By far my favorite RHCP album and quite possibly my favorite album by any artist of all time.On this CD, the band emerges with a totally creative and unique sound - one that is perfectly balanced between the old-school RHCP funk and the new style of RHCP sophistication.The sound, overall, is amazing. It is obvious that the band has matured; however, with Dave Navarro's contributing funky guitar riffs, the classic funky sound from previous albums definitely isn't ignored.RHCP shines with happy, playful songs such as Aeroplane (arguably the best song on the CD); goofy and bass-dominated songs like Pea; further-pensive and sophisticated songs like My Friends; and even confident, bittersweet, and a bit brash songs like Warped and One Big Mob.The album is the perfect blend and I have enjoyed it since the day I bought it. Absolutely worth buying."
4,Red hot addiction.,"I remember thinking in 93-94 that Dave Navarro would be a perfect replacement on guitar. And in a way he was. I'm sure it was no different than the feeling fans had when BOTH John and Chad were new to the band on ""Mother's Milk"". That was a great record too, just different than before. Isn't it good for an album not to sound like the one before it. Imagine if Beck or U2 made the same album every time. No thanks. ""One hot minute"" is great. It's got a couple rockers like ""Warped"" and ""One big mob"", funk like ""Aeroplane"" and ""Walkabout"", and ballads like ""My friends"" and ""Tearjerker"". Actually my 3 favorite peppers albums each have a different guitarist. This being my 3rd, ""Blood Sugar"" my 2nd, and ""Uplift Mofo"" my 1st. And whether this is your favorite Pepper's album or not, dont forget to check out Jane's Addiction."
4,Something different,"One hot minute is one of the best Red Hot albums. This Cd is so much different from BSSM, but the Red Hot chili Peppers sure made the right choise of hiring Dave Navarro. Dave Navarro brought some variety in the rhcp music, using simple chords so Flea could show his great bass abilities(listen to Coffee Shop! ). This album has some great songs; like Aeroplane, My Friends, Warped(good heavy song), Terjerker and Coffee Shop. Like every other album, this cd has also some bad songs, and this is why I gave the CD four stars instead of two.I'm not saying that this Cd is better than Blood Sugar Sex magic, but is worth buying it just to listen to a different kind of Red Hot chili Peppers."
3,why navarro?!?!?,"this is the RHCP's weakest effort. i don't recommend this is you haven't already bought every-other RHCP cd. navarro killed it, his influences and playin style just ain't what the RHCP is all about."
4,nice album,"RHCP have been really authentic on this album with music. Some songs can be just plain strange like ""Pea"". Overall, it is a good cd if you like this band. REMINDER: YOU WILL NOT HEAR ANYTHING LIKE DUELING BANJOS ON THIS CD EITHER. It's cool and sometimes it's like this band could even perform with Aerosmith."
3,One Hot Minute is lacking in so many ways,"One Hot Minute lacks the imagination that made Blood Sugar Sex Magic a hit. It lacks inspiration and without John Frusciante, the band seems to have lost their style. This CD is missing the soul and love for the music that is felt throughout their other great cds(Blood Sugar, Mother's Milk, etc). Dave Navarro is a great guitar player(Frusciante's replacement), but he isn't the right guitar player for the band. There are, however, a few good songs. For example, Aeroplane is a very good song, but not does not follow the Red Hot Chili Pepper style from Blood Sugar Sex Magic and before. If you like their funk-rock sound, don't buy this, but Mother's Milk or some of their older music."
2,dissapointing,"I am a huge chillipepers fan and this CD was no more than decent. It had a few decent songs but it is truely lacking. The biggest problem was the chemistry (or lack of) with guitarist Dave Navaro. If you really want the full chilli peppers effect check out BSSM, Calafornication, What hits?, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, or Mothers Milk. BSSM (Blod Sugar sex Magik) is a must have."
2,Their low point,"Despite constant member changes the Peppers have proved to be one of the most reliable groups around and they seem to reveal more and more talent in their writing as years go by . Their last couple of albums were simply amazing and "" Blood Sugar ... "" remains one of those great rock albums music lovers never get tired of . If there's a low point in their career then "" One Hot Minute "" must be it . Only the first single "" Friends "" is worthy of your time or money . "" Aeroplane "" is cathcy but forgetable , "" Wrapped "" a noisy mess of some sort , "" Pea "" more of a joke than a song , "" Falling Into Grace "" is rather cool yet they can do so much better . This is a band that has released some of the most rich , high quality modern music albums of the last decade only "" One Hot Minute "" is not one of them ."
5,dowell,"One Hot Minute is one hot album. Don't be fooled by some of the tender melodies, this album gets punky and funky. Listen to this one in the car........a must buy. Also, check out Blink 182's new one, and Green Day's Nimrod."
2,I love the Chili Peppers but this album isn't very good.,"I am a little disappointed with it. A lot of the songs don't flow well. The songs I do like are Pea, Walkabout, & Tearjerker."
5,The Best,So far out of all the Red Hot Chili Peppers cd made this one has to be my favorite. All the songs sound great and My favorite is Deep Kick. Buy this one today
5,The most underrated chilly peppers cd,"this cd is really, really good. more of a hardish rock album on the same lines as califorication.. but without Sir John Frushiante :( still that dude from janes addiction is still a pretty awesome guitarist.. a slightly misdirected and wierdish album but the singles aeroplane and my friends are great! overall this album is still very very good! not as replayable as californication and bssm, but a very refreshing change to those 2 if your a fan."
4,Chili Pepper must-have,"This album has the Pepper's most fun song - ""Aeroplane"". The others range from funky to straight-forward rock. Unfortunately, a couple of tunes sound like the funk was a little forced (Dave Navarro, though excellent, wasn't a perfect fit with the band). The generic-sounding songs make it a 4-star effort."
2,Pretty Lacking,"Warped, Aeroplane and (especially) My Friends are the radio-played singles off this record - and that's pretty much all that's worthwhile from this disc. The music has a pleasant funk edge, but its simplicity quickly makes the CD grow tiresome...As musicians, these guys have a long way to go in both the composing and the performing aspect- guitar solos are repetitive and lack talent and the lead vocals are pretty flat and void of emotion.... Worst of all is the lyrics of most of the song, which pretty much equates to garbage. Often, in the world of alternative rock, muddy unfocused lyrics take on the feeling of dark, dreamlike poetry (Take Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins for instance.) Not so here, the writing is as blunt and dead as a brick...hmm...thats a pretty good analogy. This CD, outside of the radio tracks, is as interesting as a brick....avoid it unless you have a fetish for fireplaces."
4,"Not RHCP's best, but definitely a worthwhile album","This album gets a bad rap because Dave Navarro replaced the amazing John Frusciante and the band didn't seem as complete as on BSSM. Frusciante's beautiful guitar riffs are painfully missing... Navarro isn't bad, but could never replace Frusciante. Clearly this isn't their best, but I enjoyed it. Just skip over 1.Warped (opening too long, song disconnected and slow) and 3.Deep Kick (Kiedis talks in the beginning for what seems like forever - boring). 9.Tearjerker is all right but gets a little repetitive. The rest of the songs are awesome. Listen for 8.Walkabout and 11.Falling Into Grace for some awesome funk sound. 13.Transcending is one of my favorites. 5.Coffee Shop and 7.One Big Mob are fun and crazy.If you are a Chili Peppers fan like myself then this is a must-have!"
2,One Hot Minute? One Crappy CD,"I like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but this is by far one of the worst albums I own, of any band. The only songs that keep me from rating this a 1 are ""Aeroplane"" and ""Walkabout,"" which are pretty good. ""Pea"" is the worst song I've ever heard in my entire life. I can't even listen to the last half of the album. All in all I think I've only listened to it all the way through twice. If you want some good RHCP, don't buy this CD."
4,Underrated album rocks out,"This is a good album. Just bought it after many years and love what Dava Navarro does on guitar. Very inspired work. If you like the Peppers, get this one and enjoy."
4,A Wonderful Ride,"Ecstatic Journey is a very good book for both those just interested in the mystical and for those who have had their own mystical experiences. The author brings her personal experiences into the account in a way that is not off-putting. Some authors talk too much about their personal lives, and you just wish they'd keep it objective. But here, the athor's recounting is a pertinent part of the book. The mystical accounts seem genuine and are fascinating. I'm not afraid to say that reading the accounts caused me to recall some mystical experiences of my own. If you are not too frightened by such matters, I recommend that You read this book. Go on a journey with Sophy Burnham-- you'll never be the same."
2,Didn't keep my 5year-old's attention,My son loves playing on the computer - at preschool they have the educational games that he loves to play - and at home just regular old games. So I thought for sure he would love this. He played it twice and that was it. He really had no interest in it.
3,"Not sure if it's just my computer, or what...","...but his game constantly stops in the middle of an application. we have several other computer games that work very well, but this one just chooses to be fussy. there are no scratches, so i don't know what's up. maybe it's just not being supported my my laptop very well? anyway, fast shipping and no scratches ont he cd, so the buyer's not the problem! the game itself, or my computer is to blame."
1,light unreliable strap,"guitars are not meant to be used indoors only. and the equipment some times you pull and cable , some times guitars are heavy some are light, this strap is not at all a heavey duty one,, after few weeks the threads came out and the lower end of the strap broke the stiches and fell apart. not a good decision to buy this one"

4,So Happy!,"I'm so glad to see that CBS re-released this season. Like other people, I have been avoiding buying this season because of the outrageous price on the other version. Since the price has gone down, I will most likely be buying this version soon.I've enjoyed seasons 2-4 so far. I'm anxiously awaiting season 5 as well."
2,Shop around!,"We love Lucy, but this one gets a few stars deducted because....(1) The studio really cheaped out on this deal. If you have already bought the individual volumes please be aware that you are getting NOTHING EXTRA!(2) If you are going to just repackage old stock, at least go to the trouble of opening the old ones and put them in a new shelf space saving package. This effort can be summed up in.....""Let's make a cardboard slipcase for the volumes #1 through #9 that we haven't moved, and call it 'The Complete First Season'"".(3) Some have pointed out the Amazon overpricing on this item, and I'll echo that. I got mine for $69.97 elsewhere (at a LOCAL retailer)."
5,$100.00,"First off I'm giving ""I Love Lucy"" 5 stars because it's one of my all time favorite TV shows but I have to say it was really messed up that they decided to re-release the first season. I spent over $100.00 on the first box set basically because I had to have it. I would have waited if I knew but I didn't so I got screwed and so did a lot of others. Yes, it's only money but still they should have planned it better. At least give us some sort of a coupon for another season."
1,Lucy Would Roll Over In Her Grave,"I am so disappointed. I am an avid Lucy collector, and I am one of the suckers who started my collection with Columbia House, which has now ceased production. Now I have to switch to these... We somehow need to send a message to these companies that as much as we love Lucy, we're not willing to be bilked out of our hard-earned money to line their pockets!"
5,fast and easy,received the item I purchased in less than half the time I was told. Got in in perfect conditions. Thanks
5,i love lucy season 1,"i have waited a long time to finally get the real thing, as shown on tv.not edited, no commercials, it is fantastic viewing,of real comedy at it's best. i hope they release the full 2,3,4,5,6 full season sets soon.i am looking forward to getting them as well."
5,I Love Lucy...Finally!!!!,"I have been waiting a lifetime it seems for ""I Love Lucy"" to become available in a box set. Although this set only incorporates season one, it is well worth it to any ""Lucy"" fan. Episodes include the lost pilot, ""Lucy's Schedule"", ""Ricky Thinks He's Getting Bald"", ""The Freezer"", and ""Lucy Does A TV Commercial""...(Vitameatavegamin anyone?). In addition, promos are added and the radio show that Lucille Ball did prior to ""I Love Lucy"" called ""My Favorite Husband"". I cannot wait until more seasons become available."
1,Putrid show. It should be given a negative star rating.,"Quite possibly the most overrated sitcom of all time. It gets recognition merely because it aired during the stone age of television. If this show came along at any other time it would barely register as a blip on the television radar. There is no excuse for its production of consistently crummy episodes with annoying lead characters.Lucy was irritating as $%#$@ with her incessant whiny rants. And husband Ricky leads the list as the single worst ""actor"" -- I use that term VERY loosely -- in sitcom history (and a horrifically lousy singer to boot.) The only thing I found comical about I Love Lucy was how astoundingly UNfunny it was.If you want to see a superior sitcom from the same period, watch ""The Honeymooners."" Ralph Kramden & Co. absolutely blew the doors off Desilu's brainless efforts."
1,Get the newer version,WARNING!: THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF I LOVE LUCY SEASON ONE.THIS ONE IS THE ORIGINAL BOX SET WHICH IS TRIPLE THE PRICE!! FOR THE SAME EPISODES. LOOK FOR THE NEWER VERSION.THIS ALSO HAS SEVEN FULL SIZE DVD CONTAINERS. THE NEW HAS 4 DOUBLE CONTAINERS EACH HALF THE WIDTH!!THIS IS A GREAT SHOW BUT GET THE BETTER PRICE AND CONTAINER!!
1,Colossal Ripoff Alert,"I Love Lucy is a classic, but the manner in which this series is being released on DVD calls for a boycott of this product. As an Amazon Associate providing referrals to a variety of television series on DVD, I refuse to list this item, and will no longer list the individual DVD's either. There is no excuse for releasing any half-hour series on DVD with only four episodes per disc. There is also no excuse for bilking fans of a series through high-priced individual volume releases, then following up with a box set. My advice is to teach Paramount Home Video a lesson by staying away from this product."
1,Don't buy this at Amazon,The one star is because Amazon is overpriced! Buy this at Barnesandnoble.com. It only costs $69.98! Still kind of high but if you buy each volume separately it will cost you much more! This is worth having for all you Lucy Lovers!
3,Just what I ordered,I should have known that some of the oldest shows weren't THAT funny. It's a good buy though. Don't think I'd buy it again.
4,Excellent product & service,"I requested these DVD, and the delivery time was super...as promised. The product is great and funny. good thing is that the product is worth the money....very good episodes of I Love Lucy."
1,"If you get this, you're out of your mind!!","This DVD set costs $107.99 and takes up a lot of shelf space. You are crazy if you buy this. There is a re-packaged version of this season which costs less and takes up a lot less shelf space. You'll save yourself $66.75 if you buy the re-packaged set. All the same content is there. So, be smart! Don't buy this. You are only going to rip yourself off. Buy the repackaged version for only $41.24."
3,i love lucy but they are horrible lip synchers,i love lucy very much and after spending the money for the first season as it originally came out i was hesitant on buying this but i like the smaller package so i bought it in the hopes of not seeing lucy ricky fred and ethel lip synching so badly either and it's the same i can hardly watch this set the tapes are better they are so off from the words they are saying....if anyone else notices this let me know maybe paramount will get us a fix
1,informations about I Love Lucy - The Complete First Season,First i have to say sorry for my bad english. But i am living in belgium and here we are also loving Lucy. But we can buy this DVD cause it's zone 1 and in belgium it's zone 2. Do you know if they will make zone 2 of this sitcom. Thank alot to aswer me by email alainfrancois@hotmail.com
2,It gets tiresome really fast,"Why can't I be in the show?"" ""Oh Ricky."" the above two phrases are spoken over and over and over again. While there are few laughs here and there the situations are so lame at times that one wonders what people are suppose to laugh at. I can't see what the hipe is all about but I guess it worked for it's time. It's much too dated and absurd. Unfortunately through one way or another my boyfriend and I managed to acquire all five seasons and I guess we'll have to give them a viewing. I guess if you can relate to Lucy you'll probably like this relic. As for myself, give me the Golden Girls any day."
3,This box set is took big and bulky,"I currently have the first five seasons of I Love Lucy on DVD and they are all lined up neatly on my shelf, except for this big bulky eye sore of the first season. Obviously this is also the more expensive set of the first season, as you can tell."
2,Seems like a rippoff,"9 DVDs for a single season? If the show did 52 episodes in aseason (it didn't), it wouldn't need 9 dvd's. Features are lacking.Lucy's before my time, but I enjoy the reruns, but a show this old and without extras should be on 4 DVDs and cost about 30-40 bucks.I'd rate the show 4* but this set isn't worthy of more than 2"
1,Feeling slapped in the face...and wallet!!,"How long must we put up with this corporate greed?!?!? The studio should release the I Love Lucy seasons as box sets and stop this ridiculous, greedy behavior. We do love Lucy and we are sure that she would agree that this is at best...robbery! I hope the studio will hear our voices and show some integrity."
2,HELP!,I need your help!Does anyone who has bought this collection can tell me if there are any english subtitles in it?PLEASE
5,CLASSIC,Very happy with my purchase in great condition. I am fixing to buy the second season.on DVD.
4,Mostly Good,"This is a very good recording for the first five tracks. ""Prelude"", ""Gymnopedies"", and ""Danse"" are very soulful and tender renditions, even Danse has a sense of TLC that perhaps others miss.When it comes to the Ravel selections, the recordings sound like a completely different orchestra. ""Pavane"" is beautiful, but I notice enough intonation issues in the playing to make it a bit annoying. ""La Valse"" sounds as though it was recorded through a tin can. For those familiar with this work, the tempo appears almost so slow in the beginning that the whole piece nearly falls apart in several places. Perhaps, that was the conductor's intent. Recommended for the DeBussy, Satie, and Saint-Saens. Look elsewhere for better recordings of the Ravel pieces. However, this collection is adequate for those looking for a bargain."
3,Cinco Maestros: Buy it Used,"This anthology contains a collection of short stories by Latin American male writers such as Borges, Rulfo, Donoso, and Cortazar. There are from three to five short stories per author. The editor has included a short biographical entry for each author. Most, if not the majority, of the stories are accessible and easy to read. There is a list of questions at the end of every story to facilitate class discussions.If you are thinking of purchasing this book, consider buying it used, since it is very expensive."
1,TERRIBLE QUALITY,"This really is a terrible flat iron! After reading other reviews, I purchased it against my better judgement, so I suppose I deserve what I got. This pricey flat iron worked wonderfully... the first time. Despite following the directions to a T (excuse the bad pun), it simply stopped working while I was in the middle of using it (for only the second time).Discount jungle has been wonderful, though, and is exchanging it for a new one (THANK YOU!). I would do business with them again, though next time I might pay more attention to the reviews..."
1,Ineffective,"I have used L-Lysine for years to prevent cold sores. I maintain a dose of around 3000mg per day. This has had no ill effects and has prevented any cold sores from developing. I use two other brands of L-Lysine (NOW and Source Naturals), and they both seem to perform equally. I expected Twinlab lysine to be similarly effective, but since I began using it, I have had constant prodromal symptoms (tingling, warmth, redness, small bumps forming)--it is a daily occurrence. Nothing else about my diet has changed, and the prodromes began just a day or two after beginning Twinlab L-Lysine. I've successfully treated the prodromes with Abreva, but this shouldn't even be necessary if I'm taking such a large maintenance dose of L-Lysine. I don't know if the product is inferior, or if this is simply a defective bottle, but in any case, I don't recommend trying your luck."
2,Save your money,"I bought this for my 5 yr old who knows his letters and sounds already. This is titled a reading learning system ages 4-7. It would be more appropriate for 7 and up. I played it and found it difficult to understand, the blending sounds were hard to understand and hard to find on the screen. And the animation is lacking. It literally is a story and each page has a game along with it. (Which aren't very fun) You can't skip to the page you want you have to go thru each page. This game is definately NOT for someone who is just learning to read. It might be ok for someone who has been reading for two years, but even then it lacks in entertainment. This should not be used as a teaching tool but merely for brushing up on already learned skills."
2,too specific,"I felt there were too many specific examples. I was hoping for more theory about HOW to make your code reusable. It seemed he talked as much about writing an efficient algorithm as he did about reusability. I expected a bit more theory on what causes well-intentioned code to end up getting rewritten because it cannot be reused. I also did not really understand his pseudocode notations. I'm not faulting him on that, just making a statement."
2,I returned this item,"Bad code examples and horrible code styles, but good topics. I was hoping to see more on building code modules using structs with function pointers for the interface."
2,Good Contents Horrible Organization and Code Style,"The contents and the theory is really interesting,but IMHO literate programming is Horrible and Confusing and with it you really suffer to follow and understand the code.Also the style is really Horrible,something like that of Microsoft,with all those useless macros used just for being lazy.If you compare the style of the code(the way to present it on the book and the code's style itself) used on this book and that used on the book ""Linux Kernel Development"" by Robert Love,you could find yourself busy deciding where to expose the latter on your own house to multiply the house's value and where to throw the first just to have no nightmares!(I know that they are 2 completely different books,but here I'm talking only about the style,not the contents)"
3,"Not bad, but I didn't use it much.","This book is very specific and has some pretty advanced examples. It was required for a course I took.I enjoyed the course thoroughly, and we used the interfaces from Hanson (the author) extensively.However, most of the information you need is in his source headers and online. The book is a decent supplement, but I don't think I used it more than twice.If you need it for a course using the interfaces, use what he provides online and save the money. If you're interested in reading more on advanced C interfaces or teaching yourself without a class/assignments, then this is a great book."
4,Very Useful for a short period of time,"I tried this a few times when I first started breast feeding, and it worked much better than the boppy. Eventually it just became easier for me to find a recliner with arms on it, and use that. Pretty soon I was breast feeding standing up anyway. This nursing pillow is great in the beginning, but eventually, you put it away for the next child!"
4,Better than the Boppy,"Unfortunately, I have the Boppy instead of the Best Friend. I got to try this pillow at a recent visit with the lactation consultant at our hospital and definitely like it better than the Boppy. What I like most is that it stays very close to the body (the Boppy is rounded so the baby kinda slips down), it can be used with any seat (the Boppy is best with an arm chair and does not work well with seats without arms). I highly recommend using this product!"
5,Wonderful product!,I received this as a shower gift and at first wasn't sure if I would use it. After bringing by son home from the hospital I was surprised how much easier it made breast feeding. Now that my son is a month old I put him on the pillow to feed and I am able to have a hand free so I can read.
5,My favorite baby item,"I used this nonstop until my son was about 6 or 7 months when he got too big for it. I travelled with it and took it in and out of the car with me wherever we went. Although you're not supposed to take your hands off your child when he's on it, I found that it was fine to go hands-free when I was sitting on my low lounge chair for the first couple months. This pillow made my life livable. For the first couple months, he slept on it, nursed on it while I read, ate, or watched TV. I love this pillow and recommend it highly. The only problem is the velcro is very noisy, but if you take it off really really slowly, eventually they get used to the sound."
5,LOVE this nursing pillow,"I bought this pillow after a lactation consultant recommended it, and absolutely LOVE IT!!! I had been using the Boppy, but this pillow is so much better. The baby is at your breast level and stays there since the pillow is tight against your body and does not move. The back support is wonderful since you don't have to use other pillows to prop yourself up. I would recommend this pillow to any nursing mom - it is the best!"
4,nursing pillow,"I have both the boppy and my brest friend. I found my brest friend more practical(especially after having a C-section) than the Boppy. It was difficult to position my baby in Boppy compared with my brestfriend. My brestfriend you can strap on which helps save your back. However, my baby is 7 weeks old and I am still brestfeeding and I don't use either one of the pillows. Eventually you learn to brestfeed without either one of them."
5,Beats the Boppy!!!,"Like most new moms, I bought the ever popular Boppy. One mom had mentioned My Brestfriend but I didn't listen. I tried the boppy and it wasn't working... of course I didn't know that because the whole breastfeeding thing wasn't working. After seeing a lactation specialist she recommended this pillow and it beats the boppy! The boppy is awkward, doesn't feel secure and it too round. The Brestfriend is snug against your body, stays on if you need to stand up and has a flat top where your baby won't feel like she's rolling off. I guess all is not lost, my husband uses the boppy as a sleeping pillow... like one of those inflatable neck pillows you use on the airplane. Skip the boppy and buy this awesome nursing pillow!"
4,It's a great pillow!,"I went to a nursing store and tried several different pillows and this was the only one that was truly comfortable and not awkward to use. My only complaint is that you cannot take it off in the same room in which your baby has fallen asleep... the velcro is LOUD! LOL! Otherwise, I can't imagine bf-ing without this pillow."
3,"it might be a good thing, but....","I ordered this pilow online... Wow! what was my surprise when it finally came on the mail..it is HUGE! And I also wondered where to put it after those short months of breast feeding? I guess even if you consider breast feeding for more then 7 months, this is a item that you can definetely live without. Unless you're thinking of having more children, has someone in the family that could later use it, or lives in a big house with plenty space to store all the baby stuff you used for a short time...I guess that other brand might come handy, although not as functional, you can use it later on to support the baby when it seats...But I do see that this is a great product, with a good idea behind it...just not for moms like me, with limited space, and a common sense of only buying what's necessary. Breast feeding is not that painful that you can't find the best position yourself."
3,Save your money!!,"I requested for and received this pillow at my babyshower. I tried it out for about 2 weeks with much dismay. The pillow only looks nice. It is rather hard and cumbersome to put around you, and it only works for nursing. You can't put baby to sleep on it. I highly recommend ""Le' Cuddler Infant Support Pillow"" instead--my baby loves that one. You can nurse baby on it and put him to sleep in it too. Check out my review for that one."
5,SO much better than my Boppy Luxe ever was,"Had, and used, a Boppy Luxe with my first child. It seemed fine, as I didn't know anything else.Now with my second child, I KNOW there's something better out there - the My Brest Friend! It's firmer, and has more shape (no rolling off the back or into me, like with the rounded and flattened Boppy). It's wider and deeper, so it allows for much better positioning and more options for different holds. It secures, so I can move with it (including standing, if I have to!). It supports my back, so I'm more comfortable as well. And, it even has a handy pocket to hold a burp cloth, water bottle, and/or cordless phone - things I never seemed to have in reach before.By FAR, the best nursing pillow out there!"
3,Pros and Cons,"After having my third c-section baby in three years, I tried this pillow (in a different fabric) - but didn't get it until my infant was three months old. I like the pocket on the side of it - that's great; however, I found overall it was a little too bulky for my taste. Because I work from home, I'm often sitting in an office chair when I nurse and this pillow was much too bulky for that. On the sofa, and in the bed - I think this pillow would be great. When I was at the computer, I used my Boppy (which I've had since my first was a newborn). Had I never tried a Boppy, I think I would've really liked this pillow. I also think this pillow would be wonderful for c-section moms -- anything to keep the baby off that incision!"
4,better than boppy,"I bought a boppy thinking all u shaped nursing pillows are the same. But at the same time, my friend lent me her brest friend. What a difference!! The boppy did not support the baby very well. The stuffing in the boppy isn't very uniform I suppose. He fell into the inside part of the u everytime I nursed him. That caused him to unlatch. I had to constantly re-adjust and reposition and relatch which caused him alot of frustration. Because the brest friend is a firm piece of foam and the same thickness throughout , the baby was well supported. The only drawback is the wake the dead noise of the velcro when you remove it. The sound freaks the baby out too."
3,Nice but not convenient,"With my first child, I used a ""bone shaped"" nursing pillow that I loved. Unfortunately, after 2 years of use, it couldn't be saved for my second child who came a few years after that.As my son is tongue tied, nursing has been difficult for him. The lactation consultant had me try several different pillows in her office to find the one that gave me the most comfort and him the best position. This pillow was it. It works very well for us.My big complaint is that it is not at all convenient to use. I find it cumbersome to put on and to transport. Perhaps I was just spoiled by my first pillow which was very compact with no need for adjusting anything.Another problem I have is the noise of the velcro. It scared the heck out of my newborn. Obviously, velcro makes noise and nothing can be done about that. It's very annoying though to have to ""work"" the velcro closure apart slowly for fear of making my little guy jump."
5,another boppy hater here....,I tried the boppy first for nursing here too....and it sucked! I LOVE this pillow. My family member's referred to it as my daughter's table for the first 6 months of her life! I would not have made it as long as I did nursing without this pillow. I took it everywhere!
5,Beats the Boppy -- no contest!!,"This product was recommended to me in breastfeeding class, after we already had purchased a boppy. I tried the boppy and it was a failure for me. It was not firm or flat enough. This product was perfect and has allowed me to succesfully and comfortably nurse our son for 10 months (so far). One word of caution -- beware of buying the inflatable travel pillow. I had one of those which popped within weeks before I realized that I had not bought the correct pillow."
5,The Best Brest Friend,"I won this nursing pillow at a breast feeding meeting. It is the best thing that could have happened. I was having all sorts of trouble positioning my little one. I used a friend's Boppy, but the Boppy just kept on falling down. This pillow can conform to your body with the strap. It is awesome and well worth having. I've recommended it to everyone I know. They too have been glad to have this instead of the Boppy."
5,Great Purchase!,"I purchased this pillows after reading many reviews and I'am so glad I did. This pillow holds up really well and works great! I had neck and shoulder pain when I first started breastfeeding, and this pillow helped ease the pain. The pillow is easy to slip on, and I love the pocket that allows me to keep anything I need handy. My husband finds the pillow easy to use while bottlefeeding my little girl also. I'am a first time mom and was not sure what I really needed and what was a luxury, and believe me this pillow is a must!"
5,"My best friend, indeed!","My first buy was the very popular Boppy Pillow, but after a session with a lactation consultant who introduced me to the Brest Breast Friend pillow, the Boppy was no match.Oh, my God! What a difference? This pillow provides support to the arms, elbows, and back. What else can I ask for?"
5,The ONE product I could ABSOLUTELY NOT do without!!!!,This product is FANTASTIC!!!! I actually tried using a Boppy first and it frustrated me and my baby so much that I almost gave up breastfeeding because we could not get comfortable. Then a neighbor recommended My brestfriend and I am so glad. I love it so much that I have already bought several as gifts for friends. I absolutely love this product. Don't waste your money on a boppy!****They all come with a clip now so the velco being noisy is no longer an issue.
2,love my boppy instead,"I guess I am one of the few people who don't love this nursing pillow. Perhaps it is b/c I used a boppy three years ago with my first child. I purchased this one thinking it would be helpful to be attached to me while I cared for my three year old and infant. I kept knocking into my three year old with the pillow! My infant couldn't get comfy at all on this pillow while nursing. The one thing I did like about it is the storage compartment (pocket) for different things.I bought this b/c my boppy seemed to be a little saggy and had seen better days. But in the end, I returned this and bought a new cover (which I know it doesn't really matter, but personally I think the covers are much nicer (pattern wise, etc.) for the boppy) for my original boppy and it is working great."
5,A Clear Understanding of the Gospel,"""Trust in Christ and Christ alone"", ""Accept Jesus"", ""Ask Jesus into your heart"", ""Receive Jesus"", ""The 4 Spiritual Laws"", ""The Sinner's Prayer"", ""Make a decision for Christ"", ""Make a commitment to Christ"", etc.Do all these phrases really mean the same thing? -- Or are we evangelicals spreading an unclear gospel?Mr. Hebert makes a compelling case that we have garbled the simple message of Scripture to ""believe in Christ"" and transformed it into something that's usually confusing and sometimes even wrong.Although some of the ideas presented are not altogether mainstream, Mr. Hebert makes a commendable effort to be true to the Scriptures -- much more so than many preachers I hear!An excellent read and very instructive. Highly recommended."
3,A Fast-Paced Read with aTwist at the End...,"Although this novel hit the ground running, I found the story a little ""typical"" and too bland. The author keeps your attention through a plane crash early in the book, but other than that, the first half seems mostly uneventful.After drudging through that part, the author takes a new twist and envelops the character in a chase across the country. With a surprise twist at the end that I never guessed coming, Mr. Thrasher has won me over as a new fan.I would definately recommend this book. The message is heart-warming and the end really throws you for a loop. Don't let the first few chapters get in the way of this great story!"
4,Performs as expected for an infrared filter,"This filter performs excellent in bright light. It is what I would call a fair weather filter. On a recent shoot in the Oregon mountains where there was lots of Mist and rain as well as water splash from the trees, it quickly got water spots on it. The coating of these lenses does not repel water very well and when cleaned with a microfiber cloth alone left streaking. The streaking resolves when using the proper alcohol lens cleaner.That is probably an unfair complaint against the filter. However certain other filters by other manufacturers handle the wet weather conditions a bit better. As far as the infrared performance of the Filter, it performs flawlessly. I am particularly pleased with the construction."
3,Very difficult to work with.,No distortions from the filter but isn't what I expected. Very difficult to work with in reality. Must use a tripod and long exposures to get a viewable image.
4,Tinkerbell Watch,This watch was a perfect birthday gift for the young girl we had in mind and was classier looking than we expected. It came in all the original Disney packaging.
4,The Philadelphia Sound resounds!,"This era of the Philadelphia Orchestra is unique under Muti's artistry. Lush strings, one of the trademarks of this orchestra, burnished brass, and bright woodwinds all are readily apparent and bring this recording to vibrant life."
1,Amusing but not overly accurate,"I am interested in comparative religions and scholarship of religions. This book caught my eye as an amusing and informative read. It is amusing, but it shouldn't be taken as a definitive source without fact-checking. (I'm afraid I am unyielding on the importance of fact-checking, and not by quoting Wikipedia!) I found several mistakes, which I fact-checked to be sure. All-in-all, this is a light read if you don't care over-much for accuracy. Just know what you are getting."
5,Hard to find but worth the wait,"I have long tried to find a decent copy of this book to complete my ""Betsy-Tacy"" set and was so very glad to get it. This is a wonderful story about a time long gone but fun to read about."
3,"Good, but...","Before you buy this, check out La Varenne Pratique by Anne Willan. It is similar, but superior, to Pepin's Complete Techniques. The pictures are larger, clearer and in color, and the information is as comprehensive, if not more so."
4,"Good book for culinary techniques, some not quite so common","I heard about this book in an interview with Tom Colicchio (from the show Top Chef). It's the basic book(s) that he used to teach himself the techniques to build him into the chef that he is today. It has many useful techniques, and a few that are outrageous to try unless you have tons of time and the guts to do it (skinning a hare to cook it?)."
1,Quite Awful,"The quality of the black and white pictures is terrible throughout. You'd do much better to get his videos and companion recipes. You can get much more out of a video for technique than from these pictures, even if the quality of the images was acceptable, which it's not."
5,A must own for any aspiring home chef.,"This book is exactly as titled, a detailed instructional on cooking techniques. Don't expect a recipe book because thats not what Pepin did with this book. If you want to learn the professional techniques of things like knife work, stocks and mise en place then you have come to the right place."
5,Technical manual,"This is not a cookbook, but a manual of cooking techniques. Its well written, well illustrated and well organized."
5,Jacques Pepin's Complete Techniques,"This is one of my very first cookbooks purchased at the start of my culinary career. This book is extremely well written with both useful tips and illustrations that we assist even the beginning cook in recreating the masterpieces listed there in. From creating the basic brown stock to stuffing a flank steak, there is something in here for any cook or chef of any culinary level."
1,"Complete Techniques, a complete misnomer","I'm a pretty good cook and went to culinary school. I'm also eager to learn everything I can. I'm hardly a snob when it comes to food and preparation. I also read a lot of cooking non-fiction.I love Jacques Pepin. I think he's the name man and am currently reading his biography. So, it pains me to give this review, but I gotta be honest, this book sucks. The descriptions are way too brief and half the techniques in here are completely useless with today's cooking. Tremendously disappointing.Want a real complete technique book? Check out La Varenne Pratique by Anne Willan or The Professional Chef from the CIA.Sorry Jacques."
4,"Great book, no colour photos inside though!","Great book, no colour photos inside though!Also, paid extra to speed up delivery - this didn't happen."
4,the one! the only!! the best!!!,"jacques pepin has taught me so much over the years,it would take 10,000 words to give him the respect he deserves. in 3-4 minutes he can debone a whole chicken then make it look whole again!(i've got to find a video on that one). this book details many of his techniques and does a fine job of it.the photos should be color,and there should be more of them! photos make a cookbook easier to work with,especially for the novice.even so, this book is well worth the price, make it part of jacque's contribution to your cooking style. i'm the home cook version of a chef, i don't follow all recipes exactly and i've been known to substitute ingredients(such as mushrooms in place of truffles)but, following the advice of a chef of pepin's experience has sharpened my skills and i'm certain it will do the same for you.detract one star for the photos, but get the book!"
5,A foundationstone for all chefs & cooks,"If you keep this reference book handy, you will have a sound foundation for great technique and delicious food. There is more to this work than recipes and methods: this book is a key to learning the craft of cuisine. The photos are weak, but this is somewhat made up by the clearly written instruction. The recipes are outstanding, but is the instruction that will really reward those who are 'hungry to learn'."
2,It will be part of your hose,"Like someone mentioned earlier, the nozzle will be leaking and will be part of your hose. I bought this one to replace the old one (exactly the same model), but could not take off the old one, even I went to Costco to get a new wrench, still no way to remove it. What a sticky nozzle. Don't suggest to use it if you have a metal connector."
1,Leaky and has weak return spring,"The saying ""You get what you pay for"" applies here. This nozzle *looks* good & beefy, but the appearance has nothing to do with the engineering. It quickly becomes leaky thus lessening the pressure and accuracy of pattern. My biggest problem with it though is that the return spring is too weak. When you squeeze the trigger it stays in the on position. I have to pull it back with my other hand to turn off the water. Many times I've used this thing, sometimes just turning the faucet, and accidentally sprayed myself or hit something I didn't want wet because the trigger handle was stuck in the on position. I hate this thing. Don't waste your money."
2,NOT VERY SATISFIED!,"Of course my daughter loves it! But, it looks and feels very cheap. For spending $50 on it, I don't think it's worth every penny... if any! The attachments look and feel cheap as well. So if you're looking for an expensive plastic toy, this would be one. I think that the $20 vacuums you see in the store are more durable and worth the money you will spend!"
3,not very sturdy,"I have to say I am a bit disapointed. I purchased this for my 30 month old son because he likes to use my dyson when I am trying to vacuum. This toy is not very sturdy, the front piece keeps popping off along with the two front wheels. This literally happened 15 minutes after playing with it. Although he has a blast picking up small pieces of paper with it. For the $40 I spent on this it could've been a bit more sturdy."
4,Kids Dyson vacuum,Smaller then pictured. But 4 yr old nephew loved it. His parents have a real one. No batteries required - that'a plus!
3,Not Worth the Money,"Though my son is 3 years old and has no concept of a toy's quality, this vacuum is definitely not worth it. I purchased it on June 9, 2007 and it's only July 14th...the vacuum has broken twice and I've had to glue it back together. The attachments won't stay in their cubby and the suction on it is terrible. It will pick up stirofoam balls the size of a pen head...nothing else. For $50 I thought it would be of better quality that what it is. I'm extremely dissatisfied."
4,Just as described,Its not as great as sliced bread or anything but I think the product lived up to the ad and meet our expectations.
2,Cheap and junky,"Sorry to be so negative, but this is one of the worst toys I ever bought. It speaks badly for Dyson. I cannot figure out how to even use this vacuum. The screw stripped the first time we put batteries in. The toy gets stuck on any surface. It's too loud to be safe on high. The materials are VERY cheap. It was $[...] so I am upset. For $[...], I'd say it might be OK. This is a waste of money. (I don't even know if there is auto shut-off, but I have a feeling there is not). If I have to change the batteries, it's going to break!It might look good in a museum (it's cute) but as a toy it is worthless.I like the simply Dirt Devil Upright toy much better. I think it's $[...], and it's durable."
1,Waste of money,"We have a real Dyson, so we thought it would be cool for our kids to have one as a toy. But this one is cheaply made. The wheels fall off, the front end falls off, and the wand is nearly impossible for an adult to take off. I would buy another product before this one if I was reading the reviews."
2,Not so great,"My son is addicted to vacuums and I was excited to buy this one because it makes noise and has the cyclone action. But, it isn't made very well. The front peice falls off constantly and the plastic isn't very durable. He still loves it, but it is a hassle for me because he gets frustrated with it."
4,2 year old LOVES it!,"My 2 year old loves it! She has been playing with it all day! It is light enough for her to push around and she loves the detachable parts. Even though the parts don't stay where they are supposed to, what kid is going to keep them there anyway? The wheels do not come off, as some people have said (but she pushes it on tile and an area rug). She actually has fun putting them back in the holes where they go! You will need to buy batteries though because it does not come with them- so until I get them, I cannot comment on the way it picks up the dirt like it says it's supposed to. The color we got was the purple, red and yellow, not by our choice. There is no problem with the color, because once again, what 2 or 3 year old really cares if its all purple or all yellow? For the price, we got what we expected (even from reading the reviews). Its not anything better or worse than you would buy at a big box retailer, I think anyway."
2,not that great..,"My son loves to vacuum. So I thought I would get this vacuum...it is very cheaply made, it doesn't suck up anything! I would not buy this vacuum again. My sister has the kids dirt devil vacuum, that is much better quality!Toy Dyson Upright Vacuum Cleaner"
1,Junk!!!!!!!,Notice how the one person who gave this product such rave reviews has no other reviews on this site...interesting. This is a total piece of junk - I bought it because we bought a Dyson for our home and I thought my 3 year old would get a kick out of having one like Mommy. The pieces fall off constantly and it doesn't work. Buy it and you will regret it!
3,Good heater but don't knock it over..,I've had this heater for a year and a half and haven't had any problems with it tillone day I knocked it over. The thin glass heating element doesn't have any support exceptfor the top and bottom. I knocked it over and the element broke in the center.I would have been good for the manufacture to add a couple supports along the lengthof the element to support it. Buying a new tube is out of the question. Manufacturewants you to ship it to them for repair. It's cheaper to buy a new heater.
2,Not the best heater I've ever bought,"I recently bought this heater for the purpose of warming my study which can get quite drafty in these winter months. I usually get by with just a coat and a glass of wine or two but my wife insisted I try to purchase something to keep me warmer as I am getting older and my breathing has been labored as of late. By the by I decided to purchase this heater based on its price and the virtues extolled by the maker. I must say I was not impressed, it has done little to heat the interiour of my study, this foolish device just sits in the middle of the floor and buzzes. The room has not heated at all and it seems it would get warmer if I would just burn the thing. All is not a complete waste though because it does make an interesting conversation piece when I invite fellows into my study to chat due to its futuristic look and flashy lighting. If only it worked better. Oh well"
1,Junk!!!,"Don't waste your time or money on this poorly designed and manufactured piece of junk. It arrived from the factory with the frame bent due to poor installation of screws. The paint was chipped. It's noisy when oscillating, and has only one radiating element."
1,Poor quality! Worked only for 3 months!,"This heater was excellent... but only for 3 months. We were so happy with this purchase that I even left a positive feedback about it. But soon after that its burning element died. I knew that the heater had a 1 year limited warranty. My husband called the tech support center and explained what the problem was. The answer he got was that their company can probably do the repair, but we have to pay shipping cost to both ways. Since it would be equivalent to the price of the heater itself, we decided to dump it into the garbage and forget forever the name of the company that produced such a junky product."
5,Exceptional book for beginners and experienced traders.,"Recommended reading for those having trouble getting into -- and more importantly -- getting out of a position. Written in Australian so requires some translation, but not really a problem. A MUST read for short term traders at any level."
4,Good circular saw value,I compared the Hitachi C7SB2 to several other saws in its price range and chose the C7SB2 for the following reasons:* Lever locks used for blade height and angle adjustment instead of wing nuts or knobs. My old saw used wing nuts that are difficult to tighten and loosen.* Aluminum saw base makes the saw lighter and feels more solid than pressed steel bases.* Blade lock makes it easy to change saw blades.* Replaceable brushes for easy maintenance.* Carrying case included.* Carbide blade included.* Priced below $100.This saw would have received a 5 with the exception of two issues:1) The blade guard retracting lever is made of plastic (most saw manufacturers use plastic) that could break in time.2) The Hitachi information label is lifting at the edges and will probably come off at some point.
3,Not bad for the price,"I purchased new from Amazon for $69.95 which is a good deal. However if the price is over $100 your better off getting the Dewalt for an additional $15-$20. This saw is lightweight and powerful. It is a great home owner saw for occasional use. For full time construction/carpentry use, it falls short of the Dewalt, Makita, or Portacable. The carry case does not have a place for the wrench and the rip fence, which is not a big deal, but wrapping the power cord and closing the case is a challenge. The base of the saw is very sturdy and easy to adjust, the numbers are easy to read. Overall quality and feel is about a 3 out of 5."
1,powerfull piece of junk,"Plenty of power,but you'll need a hammer to adjust the angle or depth.This is not a professional grade saw."
3,Solid saw but pretty basic,Got this one because it was one of the lightest with decent reviews. upon receiving it I saw many areas the saw could be improved but I got what I paid for so am making the changes the factory should have done myself.
4,Excellent saw,"I built a chicken coop with this and it works really well. The hitachi brand is a solid, durable brand. The saw came quickly and had a good shipping box. Please read the manual before operation due to it can have kickback. Guard works well and blade cuts well."
2,Bad translation undermines value of this book,"Knox's History of the Reformation is important, but this version is in old English and is almost impossible to understand. Quite a chore. I deleted my copy from my Kindle."
4,Recommended to clergy and laity,"Although the author says this book is aimed at laypeople, rather than clergy, I wish every member of the clergy would read it, especially those who think a sermon has to be long and address every possible angle. Using clear language and examples from people's everyday lives, a skillful writer -- like Schmidt -- can convey deep thoughts without beating the issue to death.Schmidt's introduction was, for me, the best part of the book. It really got me thinking and examining my own views.The selection of profiles of influential Anglican thinkers was excellent, although I wished he would have included even more non-white, English men.Because of its structure, the book is perfect to pick up and read when you have a few minutes. It is also suited for use by a discussion group."
5,Best AEP i ever bought,The first thing i noticed about this gun is that it looked so much like the real one. it's not heavy and it's FPS is very good for an AEP it's size. the blowback is awesome. just make sure not to drop it. If you're looking for a cheap AEP go for this one. you won't be dissapointed
2,Good For 5 Hours!,"I bout this gun and I thought cool a new full auto pistol for only $10 so I ordered it, it was delivered around one week later, this gun was pretty cool looking and shot good on semi auto then when I did it on full auto it probually took 15 seconds to empty the full mag, later that day it stopped shooting over all and all that you can here is a clicking motor ine it, so iff you want a good glock replica go with a gas powered glock.IF YOU WANT A GOOD GUN DO NOT BUY THIS GO ELSE WERE AND TRY SOMTHING LIKE THE STINGER P32 WHICH COMES WITH 2 MAGS, LOOKS COOLER, MORE POWERFULL AND OVER ALL WAY BETTERPros-It looked pretty sweetIt was semi auto and full autoCons-By the time you emptied a mag with this you could have emptied 2 mags with a spring powered pistolKind of fragilePretty lightIt broke quickly"
2,Not a bad little gun....,"...unless you plan on using it. It's a fun little gun and would probably be worth the money if it wasn't so chinsey. I dropped it once on accident and it broke beyond repair. If you buy this gun, make sure you take care of it like you would an expensive one. With this in mind, shooting is pretty fun. It didn't seem to shoot much faster than my brother's old 135fps pistol, even when I used .12bbs. It shoots kind of spuratic when on ""full auto"" (more like semi-auto on cruise control. it doesn't shoot any faster than when you pull the trigger at normal speed). Just beware if you buy the gun, don't expect too much out of a $10 gun and take good care of it."
3,It,Item was received in a timely manner and was as advertised. I was pleased to find it was thehe version as I had when I was teenager. I would rate this organization at five stars andrecommend them to anyone.Bill Gundrummsebg@comcast.net
2,"Great band, tedious album","It seems like a lot of people consider ""Junior Citizen"" a career highlight for Poster Children. I tend to think of it as their dullest and least distinguished record. Containing very little of the postpunk angularity of earlier and later albums like ""Tool of the Man"" and ""DDD,"" it's essentially a straight grunge/hard rock album-- not really the P-Kids' strong suit. Heavy opener ""Get a Life"" starts out strongly, but as it fades into the title track's chintzy drum machine beat, the momentum evaporates. From there, the songs steadily grow more generic and less memorable, with the exception of solid closer ""One of Us.""In a decade-spanning body of work brimming with energy and personality, ""Junior Citizen"" is an uncharacteristically dreary effort from the Poster Children."
5,Does just what it should.,"This is a nice and simple way to put a clip on your phone. It's priced low, it provides a better handle for your phone and it doesn't get in the way. I do have to rotate the clip a notch when I use the camera.I have used it for 5 months now and I do believe I would probably have dropped the phone more and unintentionally pressed the side buttons more without it. It might be good to get some stick on screen protectors since this doesn't offer that kind of protection. If it did it probably wouldn't be as easy to use.I have no complaints and I wouldn't change a thing."
1,Not for newer model Pearls,I bought this for a blackbery pearl 8130 from Sprint. When I received it I realized that it does not fit this model. This clip is only for older model pearls.
5,Mmmmmm My favorite shower gel,Love the way this smells. Nars discontinued it a while back and I haven't been able to find it. This smell is very familiar and I love the way it feels.
4,Christmas Gift,I can't really speak about this DVD since it is a gift and I have not viewed it. It did arrive very quickly and was reasonably priced.
3,"retribution, fate or forgiveness?","Mansour murdered his boss, that much is clear, and for his crime he sits on death row in Tehran's Ghasr Prison awaiting execution. What's not clear is why the family of the victim has remained absent on three execution dates. Is this mere coincidence? A form of deliberate torture? An act of forgiveness? In Islamic law the family of the victim must attend the execution of the convicted, and in their hands rests both retribution and pardon. Mansour's father begs for mercy. His pregnant wife gives birth while he's in prison. His fellow prisoners are carted to their own executions while inmates make bets on the outcome. Mansour is haunted by memory, nightmares, and, most of all, the tedium of waiting for his fourth execution date. That's forty long days, the period of mourning the victim's family must observe for a death in their own family. This film was an official selection at the Tribeca and Toronto festivals. In Farsi with English subtitles."
4,Good product,"This is the only mousse that keeps my hair curly all day. Unfortunately the one I got, the top was broken so its a pain to get it out. Still would buy again."
5,Great blues done the Clapton way,"What a treat to have a blues album by Eric Clapton. He was influenced by the blues as everyone knows, but has never had a complete blues album until this one. More of a tribute to his favourite blues artists than anything else, Clapton seems to pull each song right out of his soul. Some reviewers have rated him low, because they say he is not a real blues player...duh! Clapton can play the blues as well as anyone,..just because he didn't grow up in the southern U.S. doesn't mean he can't do it just as well. Just listen to his guitar work. Maybe the only thing he doesn't have is the accent...well he is English!! So sue him!"
2,Not the best tribute...,"Clapton tried to pay tribute to their blues idol, but the result was somewhat misleading... It seems something is missing here, maybe a little emotion, maybe a better song seelction, I don't know. I just know that the final result didn't please me, and I've listened to Clapton for along time now..."
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: MEDIOCRE ELECTRIC BLUES FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE!""","Clapton has not created any electric blues worthy of regard in 20 years. His voice was never anything, of high enough quality, or uniqueness, to make you get chills, or build a memory around. Today, in the 21st century, his voice is even less memorable. Maybe a quarter of a century ago, his guitar playing, could hide, his utterly, ordinary, voice, but he chooses, not to even attempt, the strong, string work, of days, ""way"" gone by. In addition as Shaq, ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", always says: ""You can't get the blues, in 2-4 minutes!"" To save you getting a calculator: There are 16 songs totaling 60 minutes on this CD. 12 OUT OF THE 16 SONGS ARE 4 MINUTES OR UNDER! For anyone who really knows, and understands, the greatness of the electric blues, genre, would know this is a mediocre CD at best!"
3,The Yardbirds Had a More Mature Take on the Blues,"""From the Cradle"" was supposed to be Eric Clapton's authentic tribute to his blues roots. Unfortunately, white musicians tend to have an irrational inferiority complex when it comes to black music, and the extremely talented Eric Clapton is no exception. E.C. tries so hard to sound authentic that he ends up bellowing most of the songs. Instead of showing that he can play the blues, it sounds like he's trying to prove that he actually has the blues. ""Motherless Child"" and ""It Hurts Me Too"" are great tracks, but ""From the Cradle"" is an over-the-top embarrassment."
3,"Good blues, Eric has heart!","I like this album. Eric's voice isn't bad, and his guitar is so perfectly timed on tracks like ""Goin' Away Baby"", and ""Tore Down."" I also though that it was refreshing to hear him play that big Gibson; the tone is so classic. I also love ""Blues Leave Me Alone."" I play the guitar, and I've always thought that Eric's phrasing was all heart. When you reach his level of brilliance, there are always going to be critics saying, ""he still can't touch his heros,""and ""he's not any good,"" but Eric definitely has soul, and his peers, Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, Freddie King, B.B. King, and others know good blues when they hear it and admire Eric a great deal. Maybe the critics just don't know how to ""listen with their heart and not with a scorecard."" There is excellent guitar playing on this album."
5,A guitar fan's album,"Anyone who appreciates the blues, especially from a guitarist's paradigm, will enjoy this recording. Clapton is always a delight. However, on this album you get to enjoy a cornacopia of Slowhand riffs and solos throughout every track.If you do ""air guitar"", you'll want this disc."
4,Back To His Roots,"The blues have always provided the backbone for much of the music that Eric Clapton has made in his career. Despite that fact, he had never released a proper blues album in his solo works until 1994's From The Cradle. The album contains sixteen blues numbers that Mr. Clapton faithfully and reverentially recorded adding his own special touches. ""I'm Tore Down"" is a rollicking number with a quick and biting guitar line, ""Sinner's Prayer"" has a dark sound and ""Driftin'"" has shuffling riff. The album's best song is the inspired ""Motherless Child"" that has a ringing guitar and perfectly captures the Delta essence of blues music. Capitalizing on the success of Unplugged, this decidedly uncommercial album became the first, and so far, only album of his career to debut at number one."
5,Tribute to the great blueslegends,"This is one of my all-time favorite blues albums. There's a real great live vibe to the recording (they actually did record it live in the studio). Kind of like a Chess album, but with better equipment. Clapton's playing is full of passion. And as far as I'm concerned so is his singing. The growling he does on songs like Blues before Sunrise may sound a little contrived at first, but listen to it a few times and you will enjoy it. It's kinda like a greatest hits of the Blues album, with improved sound quality. But it's still Clapton you hear, not some imitation of Muddy Waters or Freddie King. A great tribute."
2,"Great guitar, but what's with that voice?","Clapton displays his guitar virtuosity on this album, but his singing leaves a lot to be desired. All and all, it seems like he's trying too hard, and the growling of his voice seems faked. In fact, any emotion shown on this album seems faked to me. To hear good blues, or good Clapton, or both, there are plenty of better choices."
4,Clapton's finest guitar ever,"This is, hands down, Clapton's best guitar playing. It's all there. The phrasing is immaculate and tasteful. In terms of timing he's playing ahead of the beat, behind it, and everywhere around it. This is a development in his technique. Overall, he just sounds like he's on the blues war path. He had just quit smoking which could explain the burst of energy. Otis Rush claims this is one of the top ten all time blues guitar albums. The only thing holding this album back is that it's all covers. This is a minor criticism to an otherwise masterpiece of guitar work by ""God."""
2,To Its Grave,This album is awful. Sell it at a used CD store-- you'll probably get enough cash for a bargain John Lee Hooker or Robert Johnson tape.
2,Blues Light,"Clapton admirably tries his slowhand on the tunes of the old masters and comes up short. We all know the incredible influence of the Delta blues style on much of Brittain's rock icons (Clapton/Stones/Led Zeppelin) and as a tribute album, this might have been a fine effort.Unfortunately, Clapton now seems to view himself as one of the great blues guitarists of the centruy. One only need to go back and listen to Cream's ""Crossroads"" to realize that his real talent is riffing on blues themes and motiffs. Here, as he tries to play straight blues, one only becomes more aware of how much better and more soulful his influences were."
2,FOR ERIC's FANS ONLY,"If you like/love the blues like I do, it's hard to get enthused about this effort. It is not bad, but is still a long way short of other releases.( DAVID GOGO,COLIN JAMES,MARK MAY,GERRY MOORE,VINCE CONVERSE,JOE BONAMASSA,RORY GALLAGHER,ROBIN TROWER to name a few) White boys can play the blues as long as they don't try to rip of the originals, and add a bit of originality.Originality seems to have left Eric after the CREAM years and his mediocre blues output keeps him fed while he feeds of his legend status. This is a case of legeng status being kept alive by a good PR machine and record companies that are milking a golden cow.(how many best of's can you produce)In the face of so many superior CD's why would you buy this????"
2,What is all the fuss about?,"I expected great things from this album as I am a Clapton fan, but the result to me is rather dull. The tracks are too perfect copies and sterile. Not a single solo he plays stands out, apart from 'I'm torn down' and that is so similar to the original Freddie King version. I found the whole thing to be rather soporific. There is just no comparison with his incandescent playing with the Bluesbreakers back in 1966, or for that matter from 1975 (EC was here) or even 1980 (Just one Night). I would much rather have the originals. If he wanted to do these tracks again, why not put a bit of himself into it? At the moment it sounds just like ""Clapton plays blues greats"" and sounds all the worse for it.I enjoyed his live versions of these songs when he was incredible, but on CD they just sound overproduced and dull. What a hyped recording!"
3,"Good for you, Eric","Eric Clapton's career long dream was to make a ""blues only"" album, and in 1994, at the age of 49(give or take a year) and after 31 years of music, the worlds greatest guitarist(yeah, the greatest, I won't deny that, because he influenced the best, and the best influenced him) did just that. I have to disagree with that other reviewer. Eric shouldn't stay at that style, because otherwise, Layla wouldn't have become the rock(that's right, not just blues, but rock, mostly) classic that it is now.(Before I forget, I gave the album 3 stars because I haven't heard the album yet)."
3,Clapton and the blues,"Not a traditional bluesman? Not bad for an Englishman? Everyone, Eric Clapton became famous for being England's electric blues master. He played some hot stuff on the Bluesbreaker album in the 60s, then went on to Cream and other stuff. As far as I know he only went into that pop-rock stuff much later on. It's not like he has just decided to give it a shot with this album. It's not like blues has been some sideline for him."
5,Mighty!,"I still remember back in 1996 when I bought this album and put it in my cd player: I was really angry... because from track 10 on the CD was damaged and I couldn't play it till the end. It took me some days to get another disc and go on listening to the others tracks of this wonderful album. Oh, and with exception of two of the sixteen tracks, it's a live recording, without overdubs - Great!Clapton plays Dixon, Muddy, Carr, Boyd, Freddy, among others - It's a fine tribute to some who set a way for the blues. As a fan of Clapton and a fan of the blues, that's an essential recording."
5,Worth every penny!,This must be one of Clapton's best albums in years.Live band recordings with only one overdub on the album.The band is great and Clapton proves he's got a ton of passion to bring on board.I think it's his best playing since the 'Beano' years.
1,Disappointing,"Clapton is our undisputed guitar god - but not on this disappointing collection. With this release he was all over the TV questioning (challenging?) whether or not he, in fact, had ""the right"" to play the blues. On this album, he tries, but fails. ""I'm Tore Down"" is ""open mike night"" caliber at best. If it weren't Clapton, it would never have reached our ears. Eric Clapton DOES reach an almost unattainable height of blues guitar on ""The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions"" (Chess/MCA Records [CHD-9297]). Maybe beng in the presence of Howlin' Wolf brought out his best, but you won't hear better BLUES guitar from Clapton than on this exquisite album (which includes Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman, & Charlie Watts). Buy ""...Sessions"" if you want to hear GREAT blues work from our hero Clapton. Otherwise, his best work is in rock n' roll. I think ""From The Cradle"" sets a low standard in blues guitar from any era."
5,Really great for case work with multiple Jet clamps.,"These really make it easy to set Jet clamps at 90 degrees to each other when doing case and other furniture work. Although jet clamps can easily be set in one direction on any work table, placing the second pair at 90 degrees is unworkable without these."
5,great addition,These framing blocks are a great addition to the Jet Parallel clamps. Makes working with the clamps easier. If you get the bench dogs that screw into the clamps be sure to get 2 sets of them.
4,Good value for the money but not for fine conneissures,"From the financial side this cd, at $6.00 - $7.00, is an excellent bargain for its price. Excellent rendition of music for this price range. However, it is defintiely not up to par with, say, Deutsch Grammophone productions which are two to three times this price. Thus a good purchase for the price conscious consumer but definitely not a buy for the fine conneisseur of classical music."
4,Excellent filter.,"Hoya makes filters at various quality levels, or so I read in other reviews. This filter appears to be very good in quality and works flawlessly when used with a lens shade."
4,Performs exactly as expected for an ND8,"The filter performs very well. It is quite neutral. It gives an eight stop production. In wet weather, it does not appear to be very water resistant. It fogs up quite easily and cleaning with a microfiber cloth only results in streaking. You need to use and alcohol cleaning solution to properly clean the lens. I'm uncertain if using alcohol solution on it will cause damage because there's absolutely no information provided with the packaging. Although this may be a unfair complaint against the product, other manufacturers have better coatings that do not fog up and resist water and clean up better with microfiber cloths"
5,Works great with my Canon T3!,"I did take some shots about and hour or so before sunset which could be the reason it worked as great as it did. Whether or not it works just as great when the sun is at it's peak, i'm not quite sure but nonetheless when I did use it the results came out great! Took a 2 minute long exposure shot of the water fountain in my front yard no problem and it looked amazing! it felt as if i took a 2 minute long shot at night as opposed to the daytime. I'd recommend this to someone who wants to experience with ND filters and not spend a fortune at first."
3,This filter has a pink tint.,"After doing tests with this item I find it has a pink tint. Gray sidewalks, for example, appear to have a pinkish tone to them.I'm disappointed with it."
2,An account of an espionage network narrated by its creator.,"The Spy of the Rebellion is an account of Allen Pinkerton's Secret Service in action during the War between the States. It is specifically concerned with the incidents surrounding the eventual capture and executionof his chief operative, Timothy Webster"
3,Not what I was expecting,"I read about this album in Seasons They Change, The Story of Acid and Psychedelic Folk where the author spends four pages describing the band and their music, which is more than she spends on most performers and groups, so I was surprised when I listened to the music, because to me it sounds like a Christian folk service music augmented with percussion from various ethnic sources. The music is very cheerful, and the earnestness grated me. I wanted to like this, but after a couple of listens I can say it isn't my thing. I like depressing British and Appalachian folk music about killing, raping, lying and such (ie Comus, Pentangle, Mr Fox, Shirley Collins, etc...). The Trees Community are about as far apart from that as you can get. I wish I had gone to the Trees Community website and listened to the music prior to ordering. The Trees Community doesn't call their music acid folk, so it isn't like they are misleading people."
3,This CD is misnamed - it's no Lullaby!,"Whoever titled this CD probably didn't listen to it. Being named ""Lullaby,"" one would expect this to be soothing music - a CD by which one could put the children, or oneself, to sleep. The music is good, but it's more of a typical Boston Pops concert. There are disconcertingly loud portions, perhaps designed to keep a concert audience awake. If you like Boston Pops' concerts, this is an adequate CD. As I was looking specifically for ""lullaby"" music, I was very disappointed."
3,Depends on your learning style,"The usefulness of this book will depend a lot on your personal style of learning writing. If you learn best by a case study as an example, this book can be very helpful. (Writing teachers will love this book.)If you're more into just getting the concepts and then seeing how to apply them to your own work, this book is frustrating. (Self-taught or intermediate writer-types will not enjoy this book.)The examples closely follow a few stories presented within the book. Since I'm in the latter category of learner, I found the 'corrections' may or may not be even vaguely applicable to one's own work, so it's hard to tell which suggestions to apply and which to ignore. Personally, for my learning style, I like ""Self-Editing For Fiction Writers,"" ""Fiction First Aid,"" or even ""Revising Fiction"" (David Madden)."
3,not for me,"I did try this after reading about other crafters using it, but for my purposes it's too much trouble. I now order the fabric photo sheets for the postcards I make. They're always ready to go and it saves so much time and trouble. I had a really hard time getting the wrinkles out of my fabric after using the Bubble Jet products."
5,Great product,"This is a little more work than just buying the sheets at the store, but saves lots of money and well worth the time. Recommend this product."
3,JenkinsBubble Jet Rinse,"Haven't used the product as of this time. I hope to use it soon, but have been too busy with the Autumn chores around the gardens. Hunting season is fast approaching and so the quilting season is shoehorned in between."
3,ok,"I ordered the product based on a recommendation from a Facebook site I follow, but have not had a chance to use it yet, so decline the opportunity to review it at this time."
2,I Was Disappointed,"Let's Be Honest Here. This is NOT A Good CD. I'm SOrry. I Like Three 6, Killa Klan, Project Pat, Lil' Wyte, Kingpin Skinny Pimp Gangsta Boo, Frayser Boy, La Chat, T-Rock, Koopsta Knicca, H.C.P., And The Whole Hypnotize Minds Crew, But This Guy Is Not A Talented Rapper. I Bought This CD, And I Still Have It Cuz No Stores Want To Buy It From Me. The Beats Are Alright(Nothing Special) But This Guys Raps Just Suck D***. If U Want A Good CD Then Go Get Mystic Stylez, The End, CHpt. 2 World Dom., Or Ne Thing By T-Rock."
4,INDO G IS TIGHT!,"Indo G is tight, but sometimes his problem is his lyricism. He is the best tongue-twister with a pretty high pitched voice. Some examples of his tightness in his work on this CD are. ""Throw Them Thangs"", ""Ashes to Ashes"" (with Koopsta Knicca), ""Remember Me Ballin"", (with Gangsta Boo, which is also the priemier single of the album), ""Break The Law '98"" (with T-Rock, D.J. Paul, and Juicy J), ""Fall Up Off Me H*"", Prophet Hataz (with Gangsta Boo & K-Roc), and ""Fly Straight"" (with the Prophet Posse). Paul and J lace Indo G with some tight beats that you will be bumpin. If you ain't got this I suggest either finding someway to peep some of the bangers I've listed or cop this mutha..!"
5,phat.,"This cd is timeless, Indo g comin' straight from Memphis, this cd is phat it's the greatest release from hypnotize minds since 3-6's Chpt. 2 world domintion, indo g keep releasing great cd's like angle dust. Hypnotize minds for life!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Brings back memories!,"I was a student in college in 1976 when I first saw Elvin Bishop on one of the campus lawns for free. He was dressed in overalls and just played the hell out of his Gibson ES 335! He also sported a leather necklace with beer can pull tab! If your my age you know what I am talking about, This CD reminds me of that show and I got goosebumps my first time around."
3,elvin bishop raisin hell,"yep, just ok, in fact a little disappointing in spots. i thought it would be better but i am not a real die hard bishop fan."
4,Good Ol' Time,"I've had the good fortune of seeing Elvin Bishop live several times and the man definitely knows how to rock the house. He mixes his own style of Blues with lots of humor. His guitar playing is genuine and influenced by the Chicago Blues style. He has played in great bands like Buffalo Springfield, but he is definitely his own man. I don't care who you are, if you want to feel good, check out Elvin Bishop. His lyrics are funny and he always jokes around with the audience and his band. This live recording demonstrates a lot of that. The only reason I gave this CD a four star is because, as good as it is, I think some of his other CD's like ""Ace in the Hole"" are my personal favorites. Still, you really can't go wrong. Check it out!"
2,Teen chick lit,"I've read some of Tyne O'Connell's Red Dress Ink (adult chick lit) books and they were enjoyable. I thought I'd give this book a try thinking it might be as good or maybe even better.I thought wrong. I didn't enjoy this boko as much as the many other teen books I've read in the past. This was fun, but boring also.My suggestion... pass it up and read a book by another author, such as Sarah Mlynowski's 'Bras & Broomsticks' or any of Meg Cabot's teen reads."
3,God love you Freddie,"Love Queen and always will, but from the moment you put this in you miss Freddie. Buy this for the great Brian May and some great guitar. A really nice show but certainly not on par with Queen back in the day."
2,Where's John Deacon???,"I love the music of Queen. When I bought this DVD I thought that I should see Queen + a new vocalist, but I was wrong. In this concert are only two members of the original band (Bryan May and Roger Taylor) with a vocalist that sing well but don't have the energy that we remember of Freddy Mercury.I agree with other review in this page. It seems like other band playing Queen's songs. I prefer to remember Queen as it was originally.The name of this DVD must be ""QUEEN - John Deacon - Energy - Performance + Paul Rodgers""."
2,"I'M A QUEEN FAN AND THIS IS NOT A ""MUST HAVE"" DVD","I'M SOMEWHAT PERPLEXED AS TO THE REASONS FOR THIS INCARNATION AND TOUR OF QUEEN AND PAUL RODGERS. PAUL IS A GREAT FRONT MAN AND LEAD SINGER IN HIS OWN RIGHT. QUEEN WITHOUT FREDDIE MECURY IS LIKE THE BEATLES WITHOUT JOHN AND PAUL. IT DOSEN'T WORK UNLESS THE FANS OF QUEEN WILL SUPPORT IT.I THINK IT'S SAD THAT THE MILLIONS OF QUEEN FANS WOULD SETTLE FOR THIS. HOW QUICKLY THEY FORGET. ALLOW ME TO REMIND THOSE QUEEN FANS THAT THEY NEED TO REVISIT ""QUEEN LIVE AT WIMBLEY"" AND ""QUEEN ON FIRE AT THE BOWL"" TO REFOCUS THEIR ""QUEEN"" ENERGYS. THIS DVD IS VERY HARD TO WATCH BECAUSE OF THE ""A SCENE A SECOND"" EDITING THAT GOES ON THRU THE ENTIRE DVD. I'M SORRY BUT THIS TOUR AND DVD SMELLS THE SAME AS THE ""CREAM REUNION TOUR AND DVD"".........MONEY, MONEY, AND MORE MONEY. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE REAL QUEEN DVD'S. THEY REALLY PASS THE TEST OF TIME............"
2,Extremely overrated DVD,"This is absolutely NOT a must have dvd. Its completely out of the Queen's league. It looks like some average rock band is giving their show.. and singing Queen's songs. And thats it. There is no magic, no energy, no joy. Connection between the audience and the band is missing as a class. Although those three men in their late 50s were trying hard to connect.. but they didn't succeed."
1,RODGERS?,"THERE WAS ONLY ONE TRUE BAND CALLED ""QUEEN"", AND THAT HAD THE IMMORTAL LATE FREDDY MERCURY ON THE VOCALS. PAUL RODGERS SHOULD HAVE KEPT HIS 'BAD COMPANY/FIRM' THING GOING, AND THE MEMBERS OF QUEEN SHOULD BE THANKFUL & GREATFUL THEY HAD THE GREAT YEARS (AND ALBUMS) THEY HAD WITH MERCURY AND KEPT THE LEGACY AS IS, NOT RUIN IT WITH PAUL RODGERS!"
5,Wow...just watched this on my Hi-Def channel and am buying it!,Just watched this on hi-def and liked it so much I am buying it!Great Queen sung by Paul Rodgers (along with Freddy sometimes - it is almost a tribute to Freddy) along with cool Bad Comapny and Free sngs!I LOVE IT!
1,were is the song under pressure,everyone who has seen the concert says they perform underpressure yet its not on the dvd or the 2 disc cd whats up ... otherwise very strong and very hot dispite not being freddy mercury its like bad company does queen i still give it four stars but underpressure needs to be on both cd and dvd otherwise quit playing it at the concerts
5,This is a Champion!,"Having been to this concert in Chicago in March 06 and a Bad Company concert in the mid 7o's, This one is everything and more. This is a perfect blend of both bands with the major emphasis on Queen. The photography is spectacular. Play it on a large screen with the lights off and the volume turned up and you're there. I know this for a fact. No detracting stars for Freddies absence either!!! He's alive and fabulously represented in this video. If you're a Queen fan you'll absolutely love it. Paul Rodgers makes no pretense to imitate Freddie. It's a whole new style that makes you go away knowing why Brian May and Roger Taylor personally asked him to join them. Fabulous!! Definitely 5 stars! You won't be disappointed. The best money I've ever spent."
4,Queen Still Burns,"I thoroughly enjoyed this concert. I wasn't expecting much from this, but it's very nice and well worth getting - especially if you're a Queen AND Bad Co. fan. The wonders of technology have improved audio vastly and this sounds great. My only minor complaint is that the lights were so bright at this concert that it blinds you, song after song!Brian May and Roger Taylor do look older - but sound as capable as ever. Paul Rodgers looks very healthy and does a capable job of performing Queen's songs. No-one can fill Freddie Mercury's boots, but Paul Rodgers doesn't try to - bringing in his own style, while keeping the spirit of Queen alive.The songs are old but the collaboration is new - and THAT makes this a fresh undertaking. It looks like an interesting partnership ahead...recommended!"
1,Horrible Editing Ruined A Good Concert,"This was an enjoyable concert ruined by poor editing. There is a cut everytwo seconds, with no chance to view the band. The editor must have thought this a music video for 14 year olds instead of for fans of Queen andClassic Rock."
3,What Makes Us Human?,"Humankind: A Brief History is not a world history rather it is Felipe Fernandez-Armesto's reflections on what it is to be human, where do we draw the boundary line between us and non-us?He looks at the boundaries between ourselves and other animals. If we grant rights to apes because they're so like us, do we then have to extend them to monkeys because they're so like apes and so on to Bertrand Russell's ""votes for oysters""? He also looks at our ancestors to discuss where the line could be drawn there. As the work was written in 2003 and published in 2004 it predates the discoveries of Neanderthal and Denisovan admixtures in non-African humans, discoveries that I think would have strengthen his conclusions.Besides the biological he also considers the cultural, how 'wild men', 'wolf-children' and 'noble savages' were viewed by explorers and by intellectuals.Finally he considers post-human futures, how genetic engineering and/or robotics may influence what it means to be human."
5,Good Service - Good product,"The service was very timely. The view master reels I ordered were in good condition, and I have viewed them many times. I was glad to find someone professional that still sells the view master reels. I will be glad to order from them again."
4,"sad story, another Bush related tragedy","This is a sad and poignant video. I remember buying the first edition of the book released by Soft Skull Press, and I was amazed but not surprised by the revelation that Bush was busted for coke.J.H. Hatfield was obviously a troubled person, and the whole story is tragic. This is what happens to those who reveal the truth about powerful people."
5,An Excellent Book,"This is a must have book for any programmer or designer who wants to write practical web apps that meet the latest w3c guidelines. Makiko Itoh's attention to detail and clear explanations about how a particular concept are applied across browser platforms is the best I have seen. This book will have a place right next to Danny Goodman's Javascript Bible in my programming library. If you want to know how to do the cool DHTML things that you've seen on other web sites, then buy this book!"
2,"Good material, Very disturbing format","I bought this book due to the high reviews already here and if I were to rate the book on content alone the rating would be much higher, but...I am having a very hard time reading the book. The layout of the book is very disturbing to me. It seems like an attempt to lay out the pages using a web-style layout. I really want to slam the book shut and toss it out, but I also really want the information contained within. I'm forcing myself to read faster and faster just to get to the end so I'm done."
5,Fisher Price,"This is a wonderful book! I loved the vivid pictures and descriptions of the playsets. If you love and collect Fisher Price, this book is for you!!"
5,We've been waiting patiently!,"It's hard to believe that this book could out-do his previous effort, but this one does that and so much more! Hundreds of great photos, lots of info, and the all-important price guide makes this books a definite MUST-HAVE for anyone interested in Fisher Price toys of any type!"
2,Meh,"I wanted them for a pair of cheap loaner gloves with good wrist support for people with smaller hands, but these are totally unsuitable and I returned them. The product description on Amazon and on the box itself claims they're suitable for sparring, but they're totally unfit for anything except hitting the bag/pads.You can get better boxing gloves for the same or less from Piranha Gear or Combat Sports."
1,An Introduction to Al Hirt,"I could not have been more disappointed. The cardboard sleeve says ""An Introduction to Al Hirt"" just like the ad and just as I had ordered. Within the sleeve was a DIFFERENT Al Hirt CD called ""Hot'N'Spicy in its own plastic case.I can't comment on the product because it wasn't what I ordered."
4,Mental Health traning plus,"If you're a mental health professional, chances are you have adequate training in psychology to be an executive coach, but how about training and experience in OD and in business? these are necessry to be credible and effective in executive coaching. See a complete competency model on the website (...) NEW page."
1,Poor service,"The parcel was left on my doorstep, directly at the side of a busy road, by the delivery service. Someone took, opened and discarded it further up the road. My neighbour found it and kindly returned it to me. An example of a shoddy service and inexcusable."
1,ouch,"This book has a beautiful cover, but the poems inside bored me. I liked Flynn's first book a lot, so I'm sorry to say this. Some Ether took the unfashionable risk of expressing honest personal emotion.The whole hive thing could have been interesting, but the language here is at once too stylized and too flat to describe a world as sensuous as the world of bees. This sort of writing does not lie within Flynn's talent at all, and the world he creates gets unnecessarily complicated with the story of the Huber and Burnens characters. It's hard to keep track of who is speaking. Who is Huber? Who is Burnens? Who is a bee? I finally said who cares and gave up. I hope Flynn goes back to what he's good at (maybe better than anyone else) in his next book."
1,Disappointing,"After reading Nick Flynn's debut collection, I was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it's unreadable and fiddles around with the language too much. If you haven't already, get his wonderful ""Some Ether"" instead."
3,Nothing Earth Shattering,"Good book, lends itself to some useful conversation but all in all nothing new, nothing earth shattering and nothing that is going to really improve our relationship or change the way that I view my position or his in our relationship. Its sort of a classic psychological perspective on how different personalities blend.It is probably useful for some who have not delved into this topic of who am I and how do I fit into this relationship, how do my emotions, behaviors and perspectives effect my role in this relationship, etc. I have done a good deal of working on myself and am always looking to improve and grow and this book didn't really do it for me.Still, can't say anything terribly negative."
5,Great marriage book,This is a great marriage book! I plan to use this in the marriage groups that I lead.
5,It fits 1980Z28 Camaro,"My husband swore this would fit our 1980 Z28 camaro - although when i did the "" does it fit your vehicle "" it said it didnt. They arrived in the blink of an eye and yes, they do fit. They are cheaper if you order them here.So maybe double check on the energy suspension website for part numbers before you discount the fit.great buy - fast shipping. Good deal."
5,Back in the day...,"When I was under age and sneaking into the gay bars of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, I heard ""Young Hearts, Run Free"" and ""Victim"" and fell in love with these songs. I never knew who the artist was until I found Candi Staton here on amazon. I bought this Warner Archives release and only listened to those two songs...over & over! Finally I listened to the rest of the cd. WOW! What a great find. I recommend it. Nice mix of old school funk, disco, and ballads."
4,CANDI,I GOT THIS CLASSIC 4 TWO SONGS AND I LISTEN TO BOTH OF THEN CONSTANTLY!!EVEN BROUGHT ONE FOR MY GOOD FRIEND SO WE CAN ENJOY IT TOGETHER!!
1,Not Happy,"I was really dissapointed when this Harry Potter journal arrived. It was listed as in good condition but when it arrived with a Goodwill sticker stuck to the front (that didn't want to come off) along with a black pen mark on the cover I thought that was bad.... until I opened it up to find the first page ripped out, pen marks on the page and pen marks on the inside cover! My daughter wanted to give it to her sister for her birthday but there was NO WAY I was going to give her like this!! We had to order another one from a different seller and give it to her a day late!"
5,herrlich,"Für Freunde des Genres und des gehobenen schauspielerischen Anspruchs, ein wirklich empfehlenswerter Film."
4,Very Good Reading for Younger People,"Choose Your Own Adventure #1: THE CAVE OF TIME is a good book. I read it about 15 years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. The idea of choosing my own path through time itself intrigued me. ""Travelling"" to the distant past or distant future was very entertaining. As I recall, this and the other books in the series were very popular. Everyone would exchange stories and vote for ""The Best Time To Be In"". My favorite was ""travelling"" back to the Ice Age. I think everyone should ""see"" the Ice Age once in a while. Hahahaha."
4,"This product is great for dry, fuzzy, & out of control hair.","I have course wavy hair, and this product is great. You do have to use a lot of product, but along with a gel, this does wonders for my hair."
4,Now That They Have $1000000,"This gets four stars only because the wackiness that epitomized Gordon is totally gone in this follow-up album. Possibly because they changed Producers (from Wojewoda to Mink) the sound is the same, but the subject matter is quite a bit different. Also new are a couple songs that I could do without. These Apples and A are not (IMHO) the strongest tracks, but I wouldn't skip them consistently. Particular favorites are Jane, Everything Old Is New Again, and Life, In A Nutshell. This album seems more moody than Gordon, probably because while the cleverness in the songwriting is still there, the whimsical subject matter is absent."
5,The Best BNL.....THE BEST!,"I am inclined to vote this BNL the best because they tend to stay in the same mood instead of ""Gordon"" where they are all over the map(but in a good way...I gave Gordon five stars too)I really love ""A,"" ""Jane"" and ""Intermittedly."" I could play those songs over and over again. The best BNL so far, but everything else is a close second."
5,How could you go wrong with any BNL CD?!,"Even though the group has put out several other CDs, all of which I have, this is by far the best one! The CD has that great mixture of humor, witticism, and ballads that you can't possibly go wrong with! If you're going to buy any CD from BNL, get them all, but if you're looking for one that includes every possible emotion and the wittiest lyrics, buy ""Maybe You Should Drive""!"
2,Slow and sad,"Barenaked Ladies are by far my favorite band. That's why I've got to tell you to get any other CD of theirs before this one. ""A"" is about the only song I can listen to over and over. The others drag on. Typical of sophomore efforts this album is full of tired songs that didn't make the cut on the first album or else songs that were written before the band got a chance to get used to their new stardom. Maroon and Gordon are the best ones for sheer number of good songs. There is a reason this album doesn't sell as well."
5,Doesn't get much better than this.,"I also wrote a little something for Stunt, but since this one is my favorite of BNL, I just couldn't keep my mouth shut. The lyrics are breathtakingly clever and you can't possibly sit still while listening to it. If you thought they began their career with One Week, you're missing out. And if you love One Week, check out the song ""A"" on this album. Wrong Man Was Convicted is one of my favorite songs, period (as if the rest of them aren't). It's beautiful and clever. If I started going through the songs I love I'd name the whole album, so I'll stop here. The album is suberbly executed fun. EVERYONE should have this album, and EVERYONE should be a BNL fan."
5,Incredible!,"Don't miss this C.D. If you're already familiar with BNL, you'll love adding this one to your collection and if you've never heard of the Barenaked Ladies before, this is a great place to start. Maybe You Should Drive isn't as fun as Gordon or as wacky as Born on a Pirate Ship, but it's great. Don't miss my favorites Life, In a Nutshell, You Will Be Waiting and A. Maybe You Should Drive has some great ballads and all of the songs have BNL's hillarious sense of humor and even, at times, pathos."
5,the BEST BNL cd to date! (including STUNT),"This cd immediately became my favorite BNL cd. The songs are all unique but ultimately BNL! You'll find yourself singing along before you know it and saying to your passenger, ""hand me that orange cd..."" : )"
1,"inaccurate, dated, and deeply misleading","As Lentricchia's best-known work reaches its twentieth anniversary, its half-truths and caricatures seem more misleading than ever. For a long time this book together with Eagleton's Literary Theory served as basic introductions to undergraduates (and slow graduate students) into what was then current critical debate and the history leading up to it. How many must have been shocked to go on and later actually read the work of the critics Lentricchia caricatures only to find out how much richer and more nuanced their work was than Lentricchia had described it. And, alas, how many never went back to the originals because, so misled, they thought they now didn't need to. The disappointing intellectual life of late 90's criticism can in part be laid at the feet of Lentricchia and polemicists like him who reduced scholarly life and serious intellectual debate to comic book polemics."
2,A terrible introduction,"What ""a reader"" said, and then some. Lentricchia famously renounced Theory and all its devices in a ""Lingua Franca"" essay, but the seeds of that repentance were already evident in ""After the New Criticism,"" a case study in ressentiment.The book is interesting (hence 2 stars not 1), not for what it says about Bloom or de Man, but for the fact of its being so widely received as a vade mecum to lit theory. But for heaven's sake, if you want to know what de Man thought, read ""The Resistance to Theory"" (the essay not the book), or something else BY the man."
5,Sexy!!!!,"This soap is everything I ever wanted. I love the way it moisturizes, lathers, smells, and cleanses. Not to mention the flirtation, edible aroma that I carry with me all day. To seal the scent I follow up with the hazelnut vanilla lotion. This is a romantic sent and should be used with caution. It's likely that someone will try and take a nibble of YOU!!The bar last the longest kept out of moisture when not in use.My little 3 year old cousin said to me, ""You smell like a dessert I want to eat you!"""
4,Oh My!!!,"I am a huge Wet Willie fan-I'll own that at the beginnning of this review. However the studio was not this bands natural environment, the stage is where this band really shone. However, this set provides the song base for the incendiary shows that were to follow. It established Jimmy Hall as one of the greatest white soul shouters and Wet Willlie as a band to be reconed with.The disc is a mix of covers and originals. IMHO the highlight is the cover of Elmore James It Hurts Me Too. The structure is completely reworked to make it a soul classic, and when Jimmy sings ""When things go wrong, Oh SUGAR! It hurts me too"" it just doesn't get any better. Also a great version of Grits Ain't Groceries.If you love southern bands and great rockin' blues music you need this one in the collection. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is something doesn't translate completely from the stage, but it really doesn't matter. Buy it!!"
4,Better than Bud(s),"Takes a day or three to get used to them. Better isolation than buds or on-ear phones. Comfortable to wear for extended periods (4-10 hours). Less sonic quality then closed cans. One can go higher up the price/quality scale, but for iRiver/iPod-like devices and excluding out-and-out audiophiles, these work quite well.I certainly am happy with my purchase! :)Jim Hake"
2,Not worth the price tag,"the sound isolating is NOT as good as people rave about.yes, it does decrease the amount of outside sound you hear, but it doesn't block it entirely as many people seem to rave. If you listen to something with a lot going on, like The White Stripes, and play it a little loud, then yes you cannot hear outside sound. but if you listen to classical, spoken word, alt country, for example, and you do not crank the volume, you will still hear people talking on their cell phones, the sound of the subway, the co-worker on speakerphone 4 cubes away.I wish I hadn't spent $150 on this model and had just gone for the $70 E2 instead. Plus the cord is such a pain. the ""wear it over your ear"" style feels uncomfortable and the cord never stays over my ear and always needs attention and re-arranging."
1,Unauthorized substitution of merchandise,"The retailer substituted another model (SE210) for the E3-c's I ordered. I was not consulted regarding the substitution. I realize the newer model could be considered a technical substitute for the model I ordered, but good business practice would have been to notify me the model I ordered was unavailable, and to ask if I would agree to the substitution. I am not pleased with the seller. I cannot in good conscience recommend them."
2,Terrible fit!,"As many have noted, the sound on these headphones is outstanding when the headphones are well placed in the ear. Very precise, great frequency range, and wonderful realism. However, the key is fitting the headphones in the ear.I have spent quite a bit of time trying to fit these headphones to my ears with little success. They simply do not fit my ear well. Moreover, if you plan to use the headphones while working out, walking, etc... forget it! I need to adjust the fit every minute when in the gym. To be very clear, the sound quality when the fit is just off is very, very mediocre -- you need a perfect fit to hear the full frequency range especially the bass.I strongly recommend that anyone who buys these try them first. I also recommend that anyone who plans on using these in the gym or on the go should reconsider."
2,I would not spend the $$$ again,"The left side stopped working within 3 months. I did not think that the sound quality was all that better than the $30 sound isolating earphones I bought almost a year ago. Oh, and the $30 earphones STILL work."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the Shure E3c but was sent, without notification, the Shure SE210. Perhaps the SE210 is better, but it seems pretty sleazy to send a different item without asking the buyer. It was not Amazon that made the switch; the order came from Electronics Expo."
1,Don't buy this one,"I just have this earphone in a week but I think my sony cost $20 sound much better than this one (THIS COST ME $140), SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE."
4,great sound but not good to workout with....,I love the sound with these but hard to find a comfortable position for them in your ears when you move around. they keep falling out and the wire is heavy so dont buy these if you want to run with them or workout with. but other than that I have never heard bass before in earphones this small! wow!
4,Review,These headphones have better noise cancelling but the sound quality is not as good as the E3c-n series.
4,For motorcycle use,"While these are genuinely better than previous sound-isolating ear phones I have used with a full-face helmet, they still do not register much bass at anything over 40mph. It is crucial to get the correct seal. To do that, it's worthwhile to try all of the ear inserts Shure provides, and be meticulous about getting them properly established before you take off. Once underway it's all to easy to catch the cord, even on the collar of your jacket, and pull one of the ear plugs out. Then your stuck until the next opportunity to take the helmet off. If you're looking at using these on a motorbike, audio books and simple rock work reasonably well. For me, the orchestral and acoustic stuff isn't worth even taking along."
1,Didn't work for me,"Saw great reviews for this product and wanted a noise cancelling in ear headphone solution. However, I could not get a proper seal in my ear with ANY of the inserts. Consequently, there was no base response at all. Returned the first pair, but second pair were the same. Talked with Shure and they said you have to have a good seal in your ear for them to work. Must be my ear shape, but you should be aware that these are sensitive to ear shape."
5,Great for the Gym - Awesome Customer Service,"I use these at my gym and it sounds like I'm working out all alone in a place with 100 people! I can't hear the machines, the house music, or the people talking. All I hear is my music, which sounds much clearer than any other headset I've bought before. The yellow foam plugs provide the most sound deadening but need replacement every so often.My nice e3c headset died after use for about 6 months. I went to Sure's web site and printed out their instructions for repair and sent off my headset. 7 days later I got a box with a brand new retail package! No charge, not even for the shipping! Shure's 2 yr warranty is great! They've built a customer for life."
2,Tip broke off in one year,"The headphones sound great--no arguement there. However, I was removing the plastic tips (which need to be changed every several months) and the headphones broke. The company has only a one-year warranty so I was out-of-luck. Again, I thought the sound was great, but for this price I would expect them to be more durable...I was hardly touching them when they broke off.Also, the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times."
2,Be certain this is the effect you are looking for,I was looking for a star filter and this seemed to fit the bill. But the filter has a very agressive hatch pattern that is actually visible in some of my shots. this may be fine for your needs but wasn't what I expected.
4,Works just as expected,"Hoya filters have consistently been cheap and really good in my experience, and this one is no exception. It works exactly as expected, which there really isn't much more to say. I love the six-point star, I think it looks the best. The filter has a very good build. I had quite a bit of fun playing with this and a bunch of different-colored LEDs :)"
2,Tries to do too much. . . Not a good purchase for rotations.,"This book tries to do way too much for a 'Blueprints' book - I have used 'Blueprints' Pediatrics, Ob/Gyn, Psychiatry, and Neurology (with the first three being the best) and have liked them and found them useful. However, blueprints EM is absurdly laid out with 100+ chapters on everything from Ludwig's angina to intussusception, most of which are about 2 pages. Because of this, there is absolutely no continuity to the book and no overall sense of organization that could possibly impart any long lasting recall onto its reader. I read about a quarter of the book and gave up, finding it incredibly low yield. If you want a quick overview of EM, try 'Emergency Medicine Pearls' instead."
5,An important book,The incidence of asthma and allergy is on the increase. Who knew that all those decorative grasses and lovely pepper trees were contributing to such misery? Tom Ogren has compiled a comprehensive and easy to use reference detailing the allergenicity of individual plants. It is based on sound research. Homeowners and community planners should read this and take note of the possible adverse health effects of landscaping.
2,Don't go by the condition rating of the book by this seller,condition of book is a lot worst than the description on line. I am afraid some pages may fall out
2,Save your money,I bought this book on recommendation from my allergist. He hadn't read the book but someone told him about it. What a joke. This book is good is not for beginners or amateurs. Only buy it if you're running a greenhouse or something. I tried to sell it at a used book store and they didn't even want it cause they had copies. So if you're looking for this book go to used book stores. That way you can thumb through it and see if it's relevant to you or not. I found a much better book by another guy here on Amazon and it's the one my allergist now recommends.
4,Just what I needed,"Last summer I lost my opera glasses and bought these as a replacement. They are perfect for what I use them for - watching football games at the Rose Bowl. They give me a closer look at the action wiothout sacrificing the wide angle needed to see the overall field. The only thing I noticed is that they are sometimes a little fuzzy near the edges, but that might be my glasses, not the binoculars. I like these binoculars also because they are very light in weight, easy to lift up and no neck pain like I get from heavier ones."
4,Good electro-world music,"Open Canvas creates a nice blend of electronic ambience with middle-eastern influences with Nomadic Impressions. The tracks are all good, none of them really jump out at you but you can't skip any of them, either. The violence of Dark Sun contrasts strongly with the near-sleepiness of Muezzin Meditation. When I listen to this CD, I find it is often over before I know it - the tracks fit together so well. Nothing about this CD is amazing or other-worldly, but it's solid."
3,"Great selection, but.....","Great selection of Jose's material--gotta love his cover versions of some great 60's classics. But the sound quality sucks! Lots of snaps and static, about what you'd expect from a budget re-release of an old 70's album. Not the quality you'd expect from a new, remastered collection."
4,The slightly disappointing best album.,"It is collected most of the hits of Jose in this 3CD set.His voice is delicate, and with transparence and guitar technique are splendid, too.However, some sound quality of CDs are not good. It decreases charm of Jose. But they are a little.I went to listen when he held a concert in Japan.I feel disappointed with it because I am his fan from the those days."
2,Not a good book,This book is for the very advanced. It uses all medical terminology and is very basic with details. They assume it is for vet students. There is no glossary and there are highlighted words that they never explain. It is pure awful!!!!
2,"Well researched, but nothing exciting","The authors definitely did a fine work by doing excellent research about Microsoft's product development and marketing. This book would prove to be very helpful to those who are coming from a non-technical perspective. It occasionally offers some valuable insights into Microsoft's strategies but it is quite dry for the most part even for a person who has plenty experiences in software development. The Microsoft 'secrets' are not exactly impressive. It would be impossible to know the true secret in a book, otherwise every software company would become a Microsoft (then again, not every company wants to). The book is a bit dated, but nevertheless offers the curious reader some insights into the development and marketing of Microsoft's past successful (and unsuccessful) moves. This book made Microsoft seems to be more fallible than its invincible image of every day praise."
4,It's a great book about Microsoft's management model.,"Microsoft Secrets takes an in-depth look into the company's management model, it's hierarchical structure, organizational culture and policies for development, HR, and more. May be Microsoft's management model cannot be used in most of industries , but this doesn't make this book less useful, since this book is full of interesting insights about the software company, which remains agile despite its size."
3,DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE,"I will preface my comments by saying I am a follower of the spirit movement in Brazil. I have read The Spirit Book, The Gospel, The Medium Book as well as numerous others relating to spiritism. It is difficult for me to accept the authors STORY as fact. I want to believe but the relationship of the story to a novel makes it impossible to accept."
2,Simplistic,"Although thoughtful, its attempts at reaching the common perspective result in it coming from an overly simplistic place. Forms the basis of some religiousness among some people."
5,Celtic Harp,Patrick Ball takes Celtic Harp music to the next level and then some. Listening to beauty!!
4,Great puzzle for little hands!,"This was my son's first 24 piece puzzle (at age 2)and he absolutely loves it! The picture has lots of different elements for him to pick out and put together - the helicopter, the airplane, etc. The puzzle itself is really well made and durable and able to withstand toddler handling. The box, while cute in the Thomas shape, leaves a bit to be desired since it's not really practical for storage (we've moved our puzzle to a different box). Overall though, this is a great puzzle for a young Thomas fan. It's really improved my son's ability to visualize and put together puzzles. At 2 1/2, he can now do it fairly quickly but is still enjoying it."
2,Suspect,"The very first thing I saw when I opened this book was in the section on moon magic. This book states that the lunar period is 27 and a half days long. This is stated repeatedly. And it is incorrect. The lunar period is 29 days, twelve hours and a few minutes. If this book can't get that simple fact correct (easily verifiable on- and offline), what else does it breezily assert?"
5,Great toy!,I am a parent of a 12 year old. This is a fabulous product. My daughter uses it with her American girl doll and loves it.
1,Piece of Junk!,"What a piece of junk...arrived so much smaller than illustrated photo showed....not happy at all will stick with name brands i.e Fisher Prices etc. for future purchases. Returned it but lost the return postage so, not very happy at this time."
2,Detailed but boring,"Incredibly detailed point-by-point dissection of the crisis in Asia Pacific as well as somewhat current business conditions, but at the same time incredibly boring and repetitive."
2,RCBS Hand Priming tool???,"I have only been using my Lee autoprime for 17 years, it finally broke. I purchased the RCBS Priming tool.... Boy do I wish I had my Lee back. I would trade straight across for my Lee unit (unbroken). The Priming rod falls out! ""Dang, where did that thing go again?"" It just about takes a Chinese contortionist to reconfigure. I have been using RCBS products for years, what a disapointment."
1,RCBS Hand Priming Tool,"I'm rating this item with one star, not for the quality of the product whichbeing RCBS I'm sure is excellent. However, the company from which thisproduct arrived from "" Optics Planet"" really, really sucks.Their communications level is terrible and they had to be threatened byAmazon with cancellation before the item arrived thirty seven daysafter an online purchase.Furthermore, this is only one of several products from Optics Planet thatI have been totally unsatisfied with. I shall henceforth avoid all contact,communications and any dealing with them and shall refrain from anyand all complimentary words for their terrible service.If you ask me again, I'll really tell you how I feel."
4,Ignore the commentary,"Zora Neal Hurston was an iconoclast. In her time her career suffered because she wasn't interested in writing the kind of stuff Langston Hughes and Richard Wright were churning out. The editors of this collection of excerpts of her major works are a lot like her critics. They try mightily to portray Zora as something she was not and are puzzled by Zora's statements that seem pretty straightforward to me. Read Zora's stories, folklore and especially the excerpt from her biography and skip the commentary."
5,Fantastic for Research Purposes,"I am using this text as mainly research for an honors thesis I am writing for my Undergraduate English major. Although it was extremely helpful making connections and describing Hurston the author, it was also extremely enjoyable, holding not only critical essays but exerpts as well. I'd recommend it to any Hurston fan."
1,Bad Product,"Why do you need 15 protectors if you use just one? So you pay for 15 but use one. Then you have bubbles constanly, they never disapper like you are promissed."
3,Informative pamphlet,"This book has good information, but is small. I would actual only consider it a pamphlet. Was expecting a little more but overall it is a good basic review of the Greek Hoplite with a few good illustrations."
1,Turtle mush not turtle food,BAD BAD BAD. I have ten turtles and one will eat it barley. My crayfish loves it. Haha it says two more words required...FOOD SUCKS
3,"Cute, not exactly what i expected.","This was just an extra that i found while shopping. It caught my eye and i decided to grab one.I have a cocker spaniel (Who loved the woofy pop)Anyways, i got it, opened it up, popped it in my microwave, and got ready to treat my pup.I'm not sure exactly what i was expecting, and now it makes sense, but the popcorn (From my own investigation) seems to be regular popcorn just flavored with bacon.Its a cute treat, and its worth the price, but i think i will make my own pupcorn using flavors around my house :)Very cute product, my puppy gives it two paws up!"
3,Whimpy Performance of a Powerful Composition.,"Even if you're willing to overlook the fact that one of the horn solo parts is completely missing in this recording, you'll probably still be disappointed at the dull conducting and whimpy performance of this masterpiece. Not enough thunder and energy in this recording. I really enjoy the digital sound and the famous portrait of Napoleon on the cover though, but that doesn't make up for the mediocre performance. In my humble opinion, Muti just doesn't seem to be the right type of conductor for Beethoven symphonies."
3,what is the diameter?,"it is well made bench dog. I ordered one set but cannot use it at all.Jet does not specify the diameter of this dog, so I assumed it's 3/4"".I think 3/4"" is the typical dog's diameter.My workbench has 3/4"" holes this one is smaller, so cannot use it.I tried to return it but shipping is as much of purchase price."
3,"Does not work for Bob Revolution 16"" 1.75-2.125","This seems like a great tube for a wheel, however, if you're looking to replace your tube on a Bob Revolution stroller that says 16"" - 1.75 - 2.125 it does not fit. It is too big for the wheel. So look elsewhere."
1,Does not fit 16 x 1.75 Instep bike trailer tire,"Very annoyed. I put two of these in bike trailer tire calling for the exact same size innertube (16 x 1.75). One was clearly too big after got it on and tried to ride down the street. This made me late to pick up my kids from school. The other exploded within 12 hours resulting in a green gooey mess, which led to wasted time, mosquito bites, a scratched floor and an unhappy customer."
5,this is good stuff,"Slime in a tube is a great idea.. Were I live we have what we call ""goatheads"". The only chance is Slime or solid tires in my area. Thanks for making me a hero to my wife and grandkids. I would recommend this product to anyone with puncture troubles."
4,works well,walmart tubes always left my garden cart with flat tires...none sinced using these...but they are pricey!!!
1,"Not an original ""Magic School Bus"" book","This book was extremely disappointing. It is not written or illustrated by the creators of the Magic School Bus series and it is obvious from page one. There are none of the informative side bars (papers, etc. ""written"" by the kids in the story) and the information is not as complete. This alone makes the book less appealing than the originals, but to top it off, the children in the book bicker and compete with each other and are not supportive or respectful."
1,Not as good as the others,"I was disappointed in this book. My son and I have truly enjoyed the other books in the Magic School Bus series. They are educational and entertaining. This one, however, goes on and on and on before it eventually gets to a volcano. Poor show."
3,Book in accordance with what was announced,"The book is older than expected (published date), which is a problem for some grammer updates which are not included, but further that it is within the expected purchase parameters."
3,"Good, solid, traditional","I got this book for a class, and it has served its purpose. It is a perfectly good, very traditional introduction to Brazilian Portuguese. It only teaches Brazilian Portuguese. It is a bit dry, and contains relatively little cultural information. Also, with the exception of the preface, which is in 4 languages, the book is in Portuguese only. It is well enough put together that this is not a huge problem, but if you like explanations in English, you won't find them here. Students familiar with another Romance language will have no problems, but those without any background will not be so lucky.There are other, newer books on the market that provide at least a passing introduction to Continental Portuguese, and I would recommend them. This book is fine, and I have learned using it, but I could have done better."
2,Used book,The usedi book I got had too many scribbles on it l thus making it a very expensive bookI am not sure I would buy another used item
1,"First season stinks,","I really like Mad Tv but I can honestly say that season one is when it's at it's worst. I don't recomend buying this set. The show in my opinion starts to get really great when Will Sasso joins the cast along with Alex Borstein, Mo Colllins, Aries Spears, Pat Kilbane, and Michael Mcdonald. Now thats when the show was at the top. So I recommend buying the later seasons instead of the early ones. But then agian the show is on Comedy Central at least twice a day showing reruns, so I don't see why anyone would buy the seasons when there always on TV."
5,this is really good!!!!!!!!!!,i bought this dvd a couple years ago and it is great. the second season should already be here by now. they were slow with making the first season and now they are even slower making the second. if you're gonna start a dvd collection than i recomend buying the complete fist season of mad tv!
1,disappointing,"I have been waiting for some Madtv videos to come out...This season was so early, I hardly recognize anything or characters...it is only slightly funny...What I really would love to see is a Stuart compilation and some other funny stuff from later years."
3,A bit disappointing,"I had only seen the newer seasons when i baught this dvd pack. There are some good laughs in this season, but it is just not as good as the newer ones. I guess some jokes are a bit out-of-date, but still... a bit disapointing."
3,"Ehhh, I'll wait til later seasons.","The first few seasons of MadTV were not really that great to me, but infinitely still worlds better than that boring smegma of a show called SNL!The later seasons are better when get the likes of Alex (Ms. Swann) Borstein, Will (Kenny Rogers) Sasso, Michael (Stuart) McDonald, Mo (Lorraine) Collins and Stephnie Weir."
3,Wish it was UNCENSORED,"I like MadTV but I have to give it 3 stars for being Censored.I look forward to DVD releases of my favorite showsI.E. Dave Chapelle Show, Viva La Bam etc...because they came out on DVD UNCENSORED....I was disappointed to find MadTV was still censored....bummer, I hope they change this in the remaining releases."
4,that swan lady was weird,"that swan lady is weird. so is lorraine played by mo collins. they are funny though. stuart is funny played by michael mcdonald. and that dot girl is creepy, i dont like her. however none of these characters come until the next seasons. i dont really like the first season its boring. that lady does a good job imitating oprah. i know a lady that looks and acts just like lorraine thats why i like her. (...) bye. jessie."
5,Thank God the Other Seasons Haven't Been Released!,"Otherwise I would be forced to spend my hard-earned cash buying them! With the other seasons unreleased I can maintain a healthier savings account. With the economy currently in the doldrums that's important! The rest of the seasons with Will Sasso, Mo Collins, Phil LaMarr, Alex Boorstein, Debra Wilson, Nicole Sullivan are currently unavailable on DVD so Fox needn't worry about any substantial decline in my bank account. I'm certain that's a big concern for them. Also the fact that I might spend inordinate amounts of time re-enjoying Spishak commercials, the Vancome Lady, Ms. Swan, Darlene McBride, Paul Timberman, Lorraine, and the parodies of Whitney Houston, Britney Spears, Prince, Michael Jackson(yes, I know he's gone), and all the rest of the gang. Thanks again, Fox!"
5,It does live Saturday nights better than that other show,"By the late 1990's, SNL had become too overconfident in it's capabilities. Because that show assumed people would tune in regardless, the sketches became mundane.Enter MAD TV.Inspired by the long-running humor magazine of the same name, this show does sketch comedy better than the forerunner. The cast of fresh faces look genuinely happy to be working on the show, resulting in excellent sketches for the studio and home viewing audience.By far and away, Nicole Sullivan delievers awesome performances in her sketches. Her characters are so hillarious you are honestly not sure how much of it was based on real people."
4,"""The best of"" Mad TV?","The first season of Mad TV was definitely the best -- it had more variety (not just the same Rusty, Ms. Swann, old woman who clears her throat, etc. gags over and OVER again), and a clearly higher budget. If I bought any Mad TV discs, it would be the first season, IMO it is nearly unwatchable now. The highlights to my recollection were the very high quality fake movie trailers (ususally one each episode) where they would combine the premise of two current movies into one, e.g. one I recall combined a Van Damm move with a Woody Allen movie of the time, and what they ended up with was Allen running around a all-girls school accidently shooting terrorists as he looks clueless and spouts pseudo-sophisticated meditations on terrorists. My words do it no justice, you have to see it."
4,Worst season for me,"Ok, I'm not saying it is a horrible season, but I find other seasons to be funnier, like the 6th and 7th season, despite what other people say about them. I like Nicole, Mary and Bryan though in this season. I bought the DVD, so I recommend everyone to do so, I just wanted to share my opinion with other poeple."
4,Where are the rest of the seasons on DVD?,"This show took over where SNL left off (SNL was great for the most part up until the late 1990s, it is very bad these days) MAD tv had it's best seasons by far from 1998 to 2005, the seasons before 98 and after 05 are not very good, my question is where are the other complete seasons, they give us season 1 and then leave us hanging, do these dolts not know how many millions of fans there are for this show and how well the complete season sets would sell, some corporate toad needs to learn a little something about consumers and a little less about what they picked up in a text book about marketing and sales. GIVE US OUR MADtv !!!!"
3,Not bad,It's nice to be able to see the beginning of the series but I really think the actors/actresses in seasons 6-9 and the roles they play are much better. I still plan on collecting all the seasons as they become available to purchase though!
1,two steps backwards,"Frame's attempt to make a consistent CHristtian epistomology creates more confusion than anything else. THe principles set forth in this book hinder comunication and any sort of theological or philosophical fine-tuning by reducing meaning to application and providing mulitiple perspectives of looking at everything. Rather than a step in the right direction of greater precision in understanding, it is two steps backwards toward theological confusion in the cloak of philosphical sophistication."
2,Had him as a Professor,His theology is a little off. He also doesnt say a whole lot and I found myself with questions even after taking his classes.
1,Very old information!,"Very disappointed with this. Bought for current information about Puerto Rico and found it to be very much out of date. The quality was extremely poor also, grainy, indistinct.I would not recommend this product for information on Puerto Rico for anyone."
3,Tolerable,"This book has some useful diagrams and illustrations. It's easy to read, but seems a bit too simplified at times. Also, I think the editors were a bit lax on the writing, personally. The CD quizes are helpful for review."
4,Book that finally shows the hidden side of war...,"It's great to read something for my graduate class that shows something different to the Civil War. The hidden participants of the war, North or South, that made a difference to the human toll of the war. Who cares if the woman was a whore or not, like some described Jennie Wade, they still made a sacrifice to the men in need. Great book to show the unsung hero's of many battles besides Gettysburg."
1,Mission Accomplished!!!,"Let's see what he has accomplished: lying us into a war that has killed thousands of innocent Iraqis and American solders, giving away our civil liberties, destroying our reputation around the world, letting thousands of illegal aliens flow through our borders taking away thousand of low end jobs, putting us in the biggest debt ever and to top it off he helped us get into a deepest recession this nation has seen since the depression through deregulation. I hope we can get out of these accomplishments."
1,Hmmm...,"2 guesses why it doesn't talk...""We look forward to hearing your vision, so we can more better do our job. That's what I'm telling you."" -George W. Bush, Gulfport, Miss., Sept. 20, 2005"
3,The Year Without Michael,"Despite the fact that I was disappointed with the ending of a Year Without Michael by Susan Beth Pfeffer, my overall opinion of the book is that it is an enthralling story of a family breaking apart. The problem was identified quickly, and from there the story flowed along with great suspense and anticipation. The plot was well developed and I could almost feel the tension of the characters forming. Overall, I was very much satisfied with the book- I hope there is a sequel to make a final ending! I would recommend this book to kids of a mature age- there is some harsh language and abuse, but it is mostly a good read that shouldn&#65533;t been put aside."
3,Cool album....bad sound,"Here's a very cool ""lost"" album by a psych folk band that should have been mastered a bit better.The sound here could have used a bit of compression,and some equalization also.It's a real chore to keep turning the volume up and down to catch the quiet sounds and then flip it back down when the band comes in again....plus that EQ trouble...man,it's too much.I'd love to see this re-mastered and reissued in a better quality,because there's a very cool little lost gem hiding in all the peculiarities of this CD.Such a shame,....but you can listen ,if you can get past all the troubles."
1,Leslie's worst walking workout,"I own the majority of Leslie's walking workouts, including this one and the Walk Diet video is by far the worst walking workout she has ever come out with. It's absolutely uninspiring (a beginner would fall asleep doing this). I do it once in a blue moon just on days where I want an ultra-easy workout but I'm seriously thinking of just donating it to someone who has never worked out or just donating it to the library. The Walk Away The Pounds & WATP Express series are FAR better for beginners and more experienced exercisers."
3,What's the Big DEAL? I just bought this at WalMart for $5.50?????,"Haven't watched it yet, but I will! Thanks for the input... I bought it at the display at WalMart 2for $11..then I get home and receive this notice from AMAZON that they are offering it exclusively online for $13? Go figure."
5,A must have DVD!,"I highly recommend the Leslie Sansone 1,2,3, Mile Walk Diet because it does help to lost pounds. It is also good for heart. Exercising for the heart does preveht chronic heart disease. I use this DVD because when it is cold or too hot to leave out to go to the gym, I just put in The Walk Diet. The beat of the music is not for dancing. Leslie starts you off walking at the beat in a slow pace. The music increases allowing you to move at a faster pace (your heart rate increases ). The One Mile Walk is for 20 minutes. She then slows your pace down, allowing your heart rate to lower.I have purchase (3) for my friends! They are enjoying it."
2,Leslie Sansone Fan,I love Leslie but this DVD is not for me. It was one of my begining wokouts. It's an ok workout but she has better.
4,For the beginner!!!,"This DVD is for someone just starting out or needs a program that is not too difficult to do...The ones that have written bad reviews, I noticed already had a library of Leslie's other programs...so instead of them thinking that they needed to find a more challenging one, they just wrote a bad review...If you are just starting out and need a starting point the 1 mile on this DVD is very good...you will feel pleased with your self in completing it...I know because I was and already after just a week I feel like I know I can continue down this path to wieght loss and better health. Just know that this is a DVD for someone just starting out! If you need varity or something more challenging, keep looking."
1,"Very disappointing, poor editing, unmotivating, too much focus on the girl with bare hip bones",I have and use almost all of Leslie's videos and this one is very disappointing. There is no chemistry between the group. The editing keeps focus on the girl with the bare hip bones showing. The video is boring. The background is blah.
2,Disappointed,"I am a proud owner of Leslie Sanson's walking videos and continue to build my video library as I use the tapes in my exercise classes at two different churches. This is the most disappointing video Leslie has produced. The music is awful, the background depressing, and there are no new moves. I like the fact that she uses people of different sizes and ages. But when I am exercising, I need good music to keep me motivated. I did notice a glitch in the tape, apparently a mistake that was not edited out. Her best yet is the Express series, and Walk The Walk. I hope her future videos will reflect that same quality. Come on Leslie! I know you can do it!!"
1,"Thanks for the ""heads-up""","I was thinking of purchasing this DVD until I read the reviews; thanks for the ""heads-up"". I own many LS dvds and my personal favorites are the ""Walk Away the Pounds"" series; the ""Walk Away the Pounds Express"" series; and the ""Walk Away the Pounds for ABs"" series. Each of these three series is professionally done; however, you do still have the subtle mistakes that are typical of Leslie. Each of the previously mentioned series have a 1-mile, a 2-mile, and a 3-mile session; the ""Express"" also has a 4-mile session (don't be afraid to try this one...it is not harder, just longer). Happy walking!"
5,double platinum!,"I only know the separate albums, but this double pack sure is value for money! The two best albums by Mink Deville on one CD, packed with some of the best songs DeVille has ever written. Emotion, musicianship, lyricism, it's all here, folks! This is what Mink DeVille stood for: gritty production, soaring saxophone, heart-felt pain... Willy DeVille is the most romantic songwriter this side of the sun, I think. And the pleasure just seeps through every note."
1,Stink Deville,"Dissappointing...simply stunning. I consider myself to be an avrid music listener/buyer/critic, and I am incensed. I bought this stinky album because of the high reviews it recieved on this very netsite. I thought could trust it, but I guess was trajicklly mistaken. Thanks a lot bums."
4,Again in Hawaii,"When I started reading this book, I thought it was quirky. I still do, but it was hilarious.Freddie and Steph act like two teenagers in love rather than two mid-40 woman. The realization of love at first sight is quirky since Freddie is straight and in the process of her second divorce. While Steph is getting over being dumped.Steph's friends Wendy & Deb and Freddie's cousin, Deb & her partner Nicki help to act frivolity to ""just another lesbian meets straight woman"" novel.I'll look forward to more from Berman, even though this may be her first publish American novel."
5,"Typical activities book, teaches while entertaining","This book has lots of fun and educational activities for children. Some are math puzzles, counting, and basic addition, others include drawing, observation puzzles, mazes, and lots more. With lots of well-done colorful illustrations that keep the book interesting without making it overly cluttered Learn and Have Fun Activity & Game Book is recommended for home school or to supplement a traditional school program."
4,Great Read!,A really nice story about friends who are really more than friends...they just need a little time to figure that out. I normally enjoy all of Leigh Michaels' books; this one is one of her best.
4,"Strictly Business... Bad Start, Good Finish","Strictly Business is a book I suggest anyone read. I read this book and I really enjoyed it although the beginning starts off very slowly. There is a lot if information to take in in the first 3 chapters, but it really helps for buetter underdstanding in the conclusion. I recommend anyone who is a skeptic of romance novels read this one because after I forced myself through the first few chapters I could not put it down."
3,a book to discuss,"I'm not one to include a review of the plot: that's what the book review/back cover is for. I found the first 30-some pages unengaging. The next sections of the book seemed to focus mostly on the professor's inner world which I found engaging in a disturbing way. A view into his inner world sets up the plot itself and the big question ""did he or didn't he?"" which remains unanswered in the end. I wouldn't say the book is a page turning high suspense novel as I had hoped. However, it is unique and it did leave me wishing that a friend had read it simultaneously so that we could discuss it. If a book provokes any kind of debate, I find it's a productive read."
5,"mind-bending, brilliant page turner","On my third go-round with The Spinning Man I was once again blown away by this book. I do not usually read a book more than once but each time I find something new in TSM. The writing is brilliant and Mr. Harrar's Wittgenstein references are spot on. Again I thrilled at the verbal duelling between the cop and the prof. And, again I was left with my mind in a whirl as to whether he did it or did not do it! Ever so much more rewarding to not have a pat ending where all walk happily off into the sunset. I cannot wait for Mr. Harrar's next book. Whatever he has currently on the table, someone pick it up and publish it....Please!!!!"
5,The Spinning Man-Riveting Reading Experience,"My book club read The Spinning Man as one of our monthly selections. All of us loved the book for different reasons. It is in some ways a mystery, but not for the reader who wants to know ""who dunnit?"" The reader is allowed to wander through the mind of Evan, a philosopher. While the plot SEEMS to be a search for the murderer of a young girl, it is really something else. I don't want to tell too much because the book is so much fun to read. In addition to being what the publicists like to call a ""page-turner"", The Spinning Man is a really well-written book. I highly recommend this book!"
2,A Letdown,The book just wasn't a thriller in any sense of the word. I was unimpressed and was hoping for a thrill at the end and it just fizzled out.
1,What a disappointment!,"I, like one of the reviewers above, am totally flummoxed as to where the good reviews for this book are coming from. It was SOOO slowly paced for a thriller, and there were NO likable characters in the book. The ending, like the rest of ""The Spinning Man,"" was a supreme letdown."
2,Ben Weasel has forgotten why he makes music,"Boring, uncatchy, forgettable songs. Where are the hummable melodies and catchy choruses? Where are the hooks that sink into the heart and wont let go? I think Ben has finally succeeded in killing SW. I you want to hear a great punk band listen to older SW. If you want to be sad, listen to this trainwreck of a CD."
1,Ben Weasel Jumps on the Band Wagon,"This album is NOT the Screeching Weasel we know and love. Ben Weasel basically formed an entirely new band prior to writing this album, and then rehashed his sound. Don't be fooled, though: This rehash is more vomit than metamorphosis. Like many other ""punk"" bands in the modern era, Ben Weasel attempted to turn his efforts toward softer, gentler, quasi-poetic, quasi-emotional music. The result: An entire mistake. Like ""Bark Like A Dog,"" this album lacks the catchiness. It is sadly devoid of the raw sound that made Screeching Weasel good. Watch out for anything that is self-described as ""Emo,"" especially when it comes from one of the foremost punkers of the old school. Reattach your balls, Ben."
2,A surprisingly average SW release,"This will no doubt go down as big disappointment. After the awesome Television City Dream, this CD is very weak. I've listened to it over and over again, and I just can't get myself to like it. Sure there are a couple of good songs (Acknowledge, Last Night), but the majority of the songs just aren't catchy or melodic. The cover of the Cranberries song ""Linger"" is also pretty weak. Overall, I've heard worse music in my life... but not by this band."
3,You might like this,"This is definitely not what you'd expect from Ben and the gang. If you're used to old weasel and want to hear more of it, don't buy this. If you like emo music or if you want to hear some slower songs and more mature lyrics, maybe you should buy this. I hated this when I first heard this, but I guess it grew on me....a little."
3,SCREECHING WEASEL TRYING A NEW SOUND BUT IT DOESN'T WORK,"KISS THE CATCHY, MELODIC SW GOOD BYE(AT LEAST FOR THIS ALBUM). BEN AND THE GANG SLOW THIS ONE UP A BIT. UNFORTUNATLY IT MAKES THE ALBUM DRAG ON. THE ALBUM WOULD BE BETTER IF THE SONGS WERE SHORTER. THE LYRICS ARE PRETTY COMPLEX BUT DON'T EXPECT A LOT OF RYHMING. TOO MANY OF THESE SONGS ARE BORING AND END UP BECOMING A WASTE OF TIME. BUT SONGS LIKE ACKNOWLEDGE AND STATIC PICK IT UP A BIT.(LOOK FOR MY OTHER SW REVIEWS LOOK FOR THE NAME KOSHER AT THE BOTTOM)KOSHER"
5,top notch punk,"Wow, what a change. Similar to Lagwagons early move from metal riffs to more melodious punk and quality lyrics...this album is not what Screechin Weasel originally set out to do, and probably alienated a bunch of fans in the process...but damn is it a change for the better. They traded catchy choruses and humour for gut and emotion. Punk rock at it's best."
3,A good episode to start an excellant series,"While the episode itself had much room for improvement, it was a wonderful episode that gave us the anticipation of seeing Star Trek brought back as a TV Series."
2,Enormous disappoinment,"I read the glowing reviews and purchased the book - it is a shame that no one mentioned the fact that 75% of the images used to illustrate the book are black and white photos. The book concerns gardens of the 20th century, and was published in the 21st century - someone needs to let the author know that photographic techniques have advanced quite a bit. At the very least it would have been nice to know that the book I was purchasing with over ""200 superb photographs"" were mostly low contrast black and white images. I suppose I should have paid more attention to the ""printed on thick, glossy paper"" part of the review as a warning."
5,A must read for anyone thinking of going into advertising.,"Peter Mayle has a hilarious style all his own. He leads you through the advertising business with his witty anecdotes and quirky analogies. When you reach the last page, you'll wish there were more!"
2,I keep putting it down...,"I'll be honest, I haven't finished it yet. I've read 3 other books in the week since I started it since it is so boring. I would not buy it again, recommend it or even start it if I saw it. I'll probably finish it as a point of honor, but stick to the author's other works."
3,Slightly Misleading?,"OK, first of all, let me make it clear that: 1) The book is well-written, researched, and documented; 2) it paints a vivid picture of an extremely obscure aspect of the Civil War; 3) and it makes an ""ironclad"" --sorry, couldn't resist-- case for the importance of the subject and its impact on US History.But...when all is said and done, the guys were no more than vandals & pirates. There was no real combat, and whenever the Shenandoah faced serious opposition she ran. Navigational derring-do in the Aleutians and blind luck bobbing through a field of icebergs are salty yarns for the yacht club bar, but the wanton burning and looting of civilian ships is simply shameful, whether the perpetrators are Confederate ""gentlemen"" or Somali pirates."
4,Wish my dreams were like this...,"I liked this book so much I read it in one night. Jo is a dispassionate woman that seems to ""go with the flow"" of others in her life (i.e., her parents and soon-to-be-ex-husband) until she meets the enigmatic Alex. She finds her dreams and her reality merging as their relationship develops.This story fits the basic recipe of a good love story, but Denison keeps the reader engaged throughout the story. I can't wait to read her other books..."
5,Great up-to-date nutrition information - fun to read!,"This book really does cover everything about nutrition from A - Z. I especially liked the web links where I could find more information on topics. There were rate-yourself quizzes, easy nutrition tips, and background on scientific studies. This book should be on your shelf and in your kitchen if you're interested in eating right and getting the most from foods and supplements."
3,George Duke - Illisions (CD),Love this session by George Duke. I had it before I loaned it out and I had to have it again. Condition was good.
4,One Of His Best!!!,"George Duke is a very underrated musician...Yet, he can do it all!!! He gets very little airplay anymore and is virtually unknown except to those who can appreciate this type of music. My favorite cuts on this CD are C'est La Vie, Life And Times, and Illusions. This CD stands out as one of his best!!!"
3,Children need heroes,A good basis for being literate for children and adults alike. Just knowing who Ulysses was and what he did is important - besides a good yarn!
3,downloaded for free,This was a free download on the Amazon Kindle. Thought this would be intersting to read. Was oko but wouldn't pay to read it.
3,Good e book to read to your kids,This is a good book to read to your young aspiring mythologists. Being an e book was convenient for reading to kids during unexpected long waits in lines.
2,Give this one a pass...,"Definitely not up to typical Cuisinart standards. While the roaster is a nicely polished stainless which makes for easy cleanup, it's relatively thin. In a 400 degree oven, the pan actually bows.Look elsewhere for your roaster."
3,You get what you pay for,"I didn't go for the high ended roaster and I'd say the description of ""heavy duty"" is a bit over the top. The handles are heavy duty, but the body really isn't. If you are expecting a thick pan, you will be disappointed.That said, I bought it mostly to make Chex snaxs in and it works well for that. It also cleans up easily and can go in the dishwasher. So it works for what I bought it for, but if you want to roast meat in something other than the accompanying rack, make sure you're ok with the pan thickness (or rather lack thereof)."
1,ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF !!!!!! O stars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What a complete waste of money!!!! The actual run time was not 23 minutes as stated but an actual 7 minutes and 47 seconds including 30 seconds of stupid intro by the Travel Video Store !!! The 7 minutes did not show very much either !!! I will not be wasting any more money on anything else under the old title Travelview International series. O stars out of 5 !!!
3,A fairly lightweight glamor-retouching expose',"If you are looking for a definitive instruction book on portrait retouching, this is not the book. Readers will find the process of glamour retouching interesting: chopping inches off hips, transplating locks of hair, whitening teeth, etc. But there is not much hard information provided, only broad approaches. However, the book does provide a window into how the actual world of commercial glamour photography operates - including how art directors interface with photographers and retouchers. Troche-Stapp shows how she found a unique niche in a very competitive business. Worthwhile information for someone considering this venue as a career."
1,Useless book unless you are (or want to be) a commercial photographer,"If you are a portrait photographer (with no intention of moving into commercial photography) this book is a waste of money.There is only one chapter that will be relevant to you and that is the Beauty Retouching chapter, which admittedly is quite a good read. The rest of the book is useless for portrait photographers, who will never have to deal with art directors etc. I suggest you get the sample 'Beauty Retouching' chapter off the internet and save yourself the cash!I bought Katrin Eismann's 'Restoration and Retouching' the same time as this book and found it a good source of information on digital imaging for the portrait photographer, with chapters on Portrait and Glamour retouching."
3,comfortable,Nice feminine feel for the cross-dresser. Not the same pattern as shown in photo but ok. Leg section could be more form-fitting (tighter) but easy to put on and comfortable. Firms buttocks and aids somewhat as a gaff.
1,Worthless product,"Patched my favorite pair of jeans last night. Threw them in a cold/delicate wash this morning to make sure it was a sturdy patch job, and when I opened the washing machine, the patches had come completely off. Followed directions, heated and pressed the patches 3-4 times, and they still didn't hold. One patch was just denim; the adhesive sheet had come off and was gunked into the drainage holes of my washer cylinder.Do not buy this product."
3,good for pants but not jeans,"Only giving these a 2 Star review because I bought them with the goal of patching jeans. They colors nor the fabric match jean material & they are obvioius on Jeans. For Pants I'm sure they'll work ok, since the material is thick & the bonding glue is decent, they are also easy to use. However these are NOT for patching jeans."
1,Does not work,"The sticking glue started to come off even before the first wash. I tried to sew the border in, but i guess at the knees even that did not last long. They are also too small for boys jeans that are sizes 4t"
2,not very good,these patches do not work well. there's better options available like your own sewing skills.
5,Fostoria Tableware1944-86,"Excellant book for identifying Fostoria's patterns. Some patterns shown were not made during this time period and not all patterns are included. All in all, it has been very helpful. Great pictures, very detailed. Good use of the catalog pages. Wish they had one of the very early patterns made."
5,So comfortable!,"These clogs are not only beautiful to look at, the are incredibly comfortable! I can stand and walk for hours without and discomfort."
5,Cute and Comfy,"I love these shoes! The design, quality and craftsmanship is incredible. They are extremely comfortable and sooooooo cute! I first saw these shoes in a shoe boutique selling for $130 and was lucky enough to find them on Amazon for $39.99! I look forward to my next El Naturalista pair and am ready to pay $130 if I can't find them at a lower price."
5,Wow........great price!,I really like these shoes and am thrilled to have purchased them when they were only $34.00 on Amazon.com.They are super comfortable and make a great statement about funky taste.It's a kick to have someone notice them and realize that they are El Naturalista.....fun to be able to share my great deal too!
3,A quality shoe,I returned this pair of shoes. The sizing was not accurate. I chose not to have another pair sent back because I purchased another pair of shoes at the same time. I really loved the other pair.
5,Incredibly comfortable and cute!,I have plantar fasciitis and struggle to find great looking and comfortable shoes. Often clogs are painful on the top of the foot. I normally wear Dansko shoes and have several pair and styles. These El Naturalista clogs are the most instantly comfortable shoes I've ever purchased....and just getting better. I wear 7.5 to 8 medium and purchased this in the EU 38 in Cuero. Perfect fit. They are adorable on. I LOVE these shoes.
5,Thee shoes are great.,The El Naturalista clog felt great right out of the box! Fits just right and very comfy. I enjoy wearing them!!! Look great with pants and could wear with some skirts too. Glad I got them.
3,Very cute - color a bit darker than it shows,"Updating this review after having these a few weeks. I thought they would soften, but haven't. I would prefer that these weren't so stiff...it would make them more comfortable. I downgraded my review from four stars to three because of this.INITIAL REVIEWI have just had these shoes a few days and every time I wear them, I get lots of compliments. They are really cute...love the style. I thought the color would be lighter. I'm wishing I'd ordered a different color, but I do like these. They were tight when I put them on so I pulled out the inserts and they fit perfectly and are still very comfortable."
3,hmm,I love the comfort of these shoes. The only problem is that the color faded really quickly. The top of the shoe is several shades lighter than the sides and I cant find any shoe color to match. I would certainly like to go back in time and buy the shoes in a color that I could touch up.Comfort 5 stars. Color 1 star
3,disappointment,"after reading so many positive reviews about this shoe, i was sadly disappointed when it arrived :(1st, it's not new + unused! even though the soles are clean, the instep + straps were grubby like it had been lightly used.. there are quite a number of scuff marks on top of the toes.. if i had wanted used shoes, eBay has lots available.the size does not run large as many people wrote. i have narrow feet + these fit really snug. being leather, it will eventually stretch. this style does not have half size, so go with the larger size as it will be more comfortable. i love the eggplant (lilac) color, it's comfortable + good for running around.. feels a bit heavy + chunky though.if you want super-duper comfortable shoes, i recommend jambu + j-41.. they're cheaper too :)"
3,These shoes are really tight,"I normally wear a size 8-1/2 medium width. I bought a size 39, which is for size 8-1/2 to 9. Although I love the color, these will go back. They are fine without socks, but that won't do me much good in cold weather. These shoes are really tight. So sad...really wanted these shoes."
3,Split personalities and talents,"This album has more of a bipolar personality than virtually any other cd I have heard. The songs sung and written by the guitarist Johnny Rzeznik are very well done, especially ""Only One"" which has powerful, hard rocking guitars and is an outstanding song. Rzeznik's voice is a good mixture of jagged edginess and melody. By contrast, those songs written and sung by the bass player are at best mediocre. His voice is kind of nasally in a really annoying teen-idol fashion and his song-writing abilities are lacking. I would have given this album five stars if all the songs were comparable to Rzeznik's work."
3,"Half good, half bad","To this day, I don't understand why the Goo Goo Dolls shared lead singing duties. The guy who sings Name, Naked, and Flat Top actually has a decent pop singer voice. The other guy does not. They alternate tracks on this album, and it's rather annoying.This record does have the best Goo Goo Dolls songs on it- the ones I mentioned above, plus Only One and Long Way Down. It's a good mix of straightforward Top 40 pop and punkish power-pop that was truly the band's niche, but on subsequent records they gave up trying to rock at all. I hope they enjoy their money."
5,Dan Huebbe NY Best Album Yet!!!,"Goo Goo Dolls have improved their talent tremendesly since their last album. ""Long Way Down"", ""Name"", and ""Naked"" are their bests. I think they have reduced the grunge and hardness, and added more of a smooth rock sound, which is great. They are one of the greatest bands of the 90's. Rock on Goo Goo Dolls!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Super duper!!!,"I really love this album but not as good as dizziy up the girl.Naked and Long way down are the best songs on the album but i really hate when the basist sings, he has a terrible vocie!Goo goo dolls is a good emocore band!"
4,Refreshing new stuff to replace my lost rock batteries,"I am an adamant sythpop, eurodisco fan who has pooped on alternative rock almost as soon as Nirvana hit the doorstep. In my search for something to lift me out of the mechanical depression that sythpop can emote, Goo Goo Dolls have definitely strck a chord with me. At times flashingly groaning out powerful emotion and with the folsky and talented ""lost-love"" feel of NAME, the Goo Goo Dolls have awakened a lost retro dance-club hybernate to the power and feel of alternative rock once it got over its hangover from the dead-over Led Zeppelin-like grunge era. The only compaint I have is the one or two songs that dreadfully copy the warmed-over nasaly Green Day feel. Skip over those tracks. Nevertheless, I have emerged into the light thanks to the Goos. I also recommend SLIDE, the only rock song I can never tire of."
4,Goo Goo Dolls' Best Yet,"This album knocks the wind out of you from its opening chord and takes you on a musical journey right through to the final notes of the raucous (and hilarious) ""Slave Girl"". I think this album is the culmination of a musical metamorphasis that began on ""Hold Me Up"", really took shape on ""Superstar Car Wash"", peaked on this album, and maybe went a little too far in the pop direction on ""Dizzy Up the Girl"". There are probably a lot of disappointed people out there who bought this album for the Dolls' breakthrough hit, ""Named"", and found that it is the only song on the record with that acoustic feel. There are probably others who are disappointed that this record retains only a shadow of the frenetic energy found on ""Jed"". My only disappointment was that just as the Beatles Rubber Soul and Revolver are practically indistinguishable, so too with ""Superstar Car Wash"" and ""A Boy Named Goo"". All in all, however, an effort that shows maturity and balance by the boys from Buffalo."
4,Their Last GREAT album.,"This is a first-rate CD filled with some choice catchy power-pop nuggets...the band seemed to have found a nice balance between their ramshackle, punky beginnings and the previous attempted-but-failed commercial breakthrough, the under-appreciated ""Superstar Carwash."" The forceful ""Long Way Down"" and the scruffy ""Flat Top"" are a couple of standouts here. And then there's ""Name,"" the acoustic ballad that finally brought them the widespread radio airplay they'd deserved for years. Unfortunately, future releases were patterned after this tune and the band, sadly, forsook the edge and drive that their early fans had come to expect. There was a distressing loss of identity to much of what came after ""A Boy Named Goo."" Therefore, they sounded like every other jangle-pop Gin Blossoms wannabe clogging the airwaves. Perhaps some day, they can return to their roots and reharness that let-it-rip energy that us oldsters enjoyed so much. My fingers are crossed."
3,I wasn't feeling this at first....,"I must say when I first listened to a boy named goo I was disappointed. I really did not like it, and I was surprised because in general I really like the goo goo dolls. I saw them live once and they were pretty awesome. It's hard to explain why I didn't enjoy this cd, but I guess it just didn't have that oomph that makes a song or an album great. I also didn't like how on one song Johnny was the lead singer and on the next Robby was, back and forth throughout the entire cd, it felt and sounded sorta amateur (and not in a good way) and just seemed kinda disconnected. I can't say any song was bad, but I didn't fall in love with any except for the one I already knew. All in all after the second and third listen it has started to grow on me. I find the best songs to be: name, flat top, naked, ain't that unusual and eyes wide open."
2,"Sorry, to burst your bubble...","personally, I bought this album and turned right around the following week and sold it for half of what I paid for it just to get rid of it... this and Candlebox's lucy were two of the most mono-meldey driven albums I've ever heard. don't get me wrong... I love the song Name it was the soul purpose of buying it in the first place but I was so disapointed in the rest of the album I didn't want to keep it... since then they've put out other songs I like but I think I'll wait for the greatest hits album before I buy anything else..."
3,"""Boy Named Goo"" Solid, but only a preview of things to come","The Goo Goo Dolls burst on the scene a few years ago with this CD. Unfortunately, their years of 80s rock showed up on this CD (in Slave Girl, for example). Now in the 1980s, this was a GOOD thing, but in the 90s, it seemed out of date. But there are indications of the greatness to come. ""Long Way Down"", though sounding alittle like the 80s rock I mentioned before, it also showed an edge to it that isn't present in the 80s glam-rock bands of that thankfully dead era. But the song that really put them on the map was the ballad ""Name"". That put them on top of the charts, and helped them sell more of this CD than it probably deserved. However, the Goo Goo Dolls would take that song, and go further with that style in their next album, going farther than even they ever imagined. If you are new to the Goo Goo Dolls (from City of Angels), then this one is worth a look....but maybe not much more."
3,Could have been better...,"I have always been a fan of the Goo Goo Dolls, but they could have done better. Sure they had their good hits like ""Name"", ""Naked"", and ""Long way down"" but in my point of view, they all sounded the same. They could of had a little originality. It is a good CD, but not there best."
5,Lyrical/Muscial Genuises,"A great buy especially considering at most places you can find this cd on the bargain racks. ABNG is a somewhat hard to explain album because in a sense it presents the GGD two very different styles. In one sense you have the most prominent song on the album ""name"" being more of a soft sided heartfelt song. However thats only 10-20% of what the album is. The majority of the songs are actually a little bit harder not to say that its anything like say slipknot or afi but more like ""Dizzy"" off DUTG. Which need i remind anyone was a great song that got a ton of radio airplay as well. A less dramatic album than say DUTG but more so than Gutterflower the GGD's effort here is close to competing with DUTG for their best album and the only way to chose a winner is to decide which style you prefer"
1,Sorry! I think this music is basically boring and everyday,Goo-Goo Dolls aren't all that great. Their music has been done before.There are so many artists who do that type of stuff.Even in the first place I don't think that style is all that great;alot of guitars and instruments all cluttered together plus an off-pitch scratchy voice on top of it.Even though its not really loud I consider it alot of boring noise.BOO!
3,pretty good,"This album is pretty good, though they should be paying royalties to The Replacements on some of these songs."
4,A pretty book with nice recipes,"The photos are lovely, and the recipes are quite straightforward. A nice ""pasta"" cookbook."
5,PASTA,PASTA IS A GREAT COOK FOR HOME COOKS LIKE MYSELF IT KEEPS THE FAMILY WONDERING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WHATS FOR DINNER
2,Too General,"I picked up this book because of Lonely Planet's good name. For general reading it's okay for an overview but for solid trail advice and exact information that a hiker really needs, it misses the mark. I only visited one island and there weren't enough listings to make purchasing this book worthwhile."
2,Assumes you are using public transportation??,"Maybe I haven't looked up enough hikes, but it seems to assume you will be taking the bus to all the hikes, and says nothing about driving directions or where to park. For instance, on p. 79 for the Maunawili Demonstration Trail, it says how you should start walking from town. It says nothing about parking. Then from the end of the trail, it says how to take a bus back to town. Although it would be handy for those who ARE stuck with public transportation, I feel they should include enough info for drivers as well."
3,Bought it for the Nibelle track,"Hard to find a recording of the Nibelle Toccata, even harder to find the sheet music. I know of only one other recording of the Toccata and that CD is out of print now"
5,"Outstanding, Outstanding, Outstanding","Please do yourself a favor and read this book! I strongly recommend reading ""Standing at the Scratch Line"" first. King Tremain is a person I looked up to. I feel as if I know him. I also cried like a baby at the end of the book. Johnson's writing makes you feel as if you are there with the people in the book. To Mr. Johnson: I'm glad a friend gave me ""Standing at the Scratch Line"" to read two years. Now, I'm looking forward to ALL your work in the future."
5,A Must Read!,"Bravo to Mr. Johnson for writing such an engaging story! The characters were written so real, I literally lived in their world for two weeks. My only submission of release of Tremain and all the cast characters, was in knowing that I would encounter them again in Mr. Johnson's next novel...so please don't let your fans down. Give us more please!"
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"After reading ""Standing at the Scratch Line"" I could hardly wait to read the sequel. I had fallen in love with King Tremain and wanted to learn more about the grandson, Jackson, and the relationship between him and his grandmother, Serena. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as the first one. One, it was too long and two, too much time was devoted to telling about other gansters and mob figures instead of sticking with the Tremain storyline. For me, it was not as well written as the first book. The information on the Tremains is excellent but I could have done without all the other digressions."
1,A complete waste of time and money,"I purchased this product 7 months ago and listened to it religiously for 6 months solid and....nothing! I made a point of listening every day at the same time and played all 3 tracks most of the time, but never fewer than 2 tracks. I have derived absolutely no benefit whatever from listening to Insight,despite the inflated claims that have been made about this audio CD. Frankly it is a complete waste of time and money as it DOES NOT deliver on the claims made about it. I hate to see people ripped off and that is exactly what you will be if you make the big mistake of purchasing this product. The only reason I have given a rating of one star is because there was no zero option available."
2,Value as a commodity is not,"CD was scratched. Value as a commodity is not. Was disappointed.Do not buy used again.If you were here, has returned USA. Gave up so foreign."
2,DON'T BUY IT...,"I brought this product two days back and I really was disappointed when I played the CD.The CD has three tracks:Track 1: Journey 24:04 minTrack 1: Exploration 24:04 minTrack 3: Insight 24:04 minThe entire above tracks has almost the same rainfall sound, for me I haven't found it helpful nor achieve any of the below points.1) Achieve profound states of deep meditation and relaxation; 2) Significantly reduce stress and anxiety; 3) Improve your sleep and increase energy and vitality; 4) Awaken your potential for long-term personal growth; 5) Dramatically increase your self-awareness; 6) Take your inspiration and motivation to new levels; 7) Experience expanded states of consciousness; 8) Develop your intuition and expand your personal insight; 9) Reach deep into your subconscious mind for life solutions.!!!!!!!!??"
5,Virtuoso scholarship that renders a public service.,"THE SHAMBHALA GUIDE to SUFISM is a virtuoso performance in academic scholarship. The complex difficulties of the subject can be readily appreciated form the fact that the first 30 pages are devoted to an effort to define the meaning of the words sufi and sufism. It is a global misfortune that in our commonly received historical accounts political and religious forces have been conflated, leading Islam and Christendom to regard each other as enemy. Into these dark clouds of mutual misunderstandings Prof Ernst brings his brilliant light. His book needs to be widely read, for the benefit of both East and West; pace Kiplng, in Ernst the twain have met. He has rendered a public service. Star rating: 5X2."
4,Solid Glove,"Even though this is glove is advertised as a softball glove, it's more of a baseball glove. If you want a bigger pocket, I'd go with a 13"" glove (I have average female hands). Aside from that, the glove is solid and a good value for the price. It's taking a little longer than I'd like to break in but when it's broken in, this glove will be a keeper."
3,"Indifferent to the book : not terrible, not great either.","After finishing this book I felt sadly indifferent towards it. I didn't feel like I lost my time or money with this book but I didn't feel like I added any great activities to my personal activity database either. Would I recommend it? I guess not. If no activity sticks out in my mind after a fresh reading, I guess it means I won't refer back to it very often and neither will you possibly."
4,Sweet & Simple,"Tiny little book, broken up into birth to 3 months, 3-6 mo, 6-9 mo & 9-12 mo (95 pages) Quick and easy ideas for having fun with your little one.. this would make a nice gift for a baby sitter too! Sweet little book."
2,Disappointed...,"I was happy to find this book since I've read most of Florence King's other works. Unfortunately, it didn't hold my interest as much as her other volumes. I'm glad I bought it because many of her works are out of print, but that's the only reason."
4,It happened to me,"I actually met a man of an older generation who tested me by speaking of scatological subjects so that he could rate my openness to sexual approach. Just as Florence notes in the book. As always, she is spot on.Not her best book, but close."
3,"If taking Genetics, a MUST","I HIGHLY recommend buying this manual in conjunction with the book- it explains enough for you to figure out whatever problems/concept you need to get down before a test.The book doesn't explain jack when it comes to problems; it's like it expects you to know how to do complicated problems at the end of each chapter. However, this manual solves all your problems.Update: Now that I am finished with my Honors Genetics Course and have done/memorized every problem in this manual painstakingly bit by bit, I think a lot of the answers are not very clear. There are typos everywhere as well, and this manual seems like it was made the week before it was due to the publishers, if you know what I mean. Drawings are kind of lazy and many questions don't have an answer, or a clear one at that."
3,need of an editor,This solutions manual has some sort of typo in every chapter and this results in wrong answers. this was a bit frustrating..
5,Incredible book,"This book comes with an excellent set of questions and solutions. The writing is very easy to follow and understand. It's not very dense at all, but it has a lot of good information."
1,Never arrived!!!,"I'm so disappointed. I never received this product, now I have to contact the company and spend time to figure out what it happened!!!"
5,Prompt service,"I requested for the seller to send the package ASAP because I started classes the following week. When I contacted the seller, their response was prompt and friendly. I received my package even earlier than I expected. Thank you!"
3,"Binders are medium-grade, but good value for the price","They bend easily, like if you stack them with some heavy books on a shelf, there will be a crease in the cover, but honestly, for the price, they are a really good deal. I would buy them again. I have a whole bunch and I use them for personal filing. If I were going to make a business presentation, however, I would probably opt for a stronger grade of binder."
5,Good deal.,These were a great deal. I needed simple binders for my students and these fit the bill. Good value and so far they've worked great.
2,offspring punk instead of bozo spazcore,Had to throw my two cents in here.Ohh Crickey ... was a landmark metal/thrash/humor debut from a handful of wackjobs from overseas covering everything from Kim Wilde to Motorhead plus 20 originals in between of complete madness and playing precision.Return of ... was on okay sophmore release for the band releasing some more of the same.Then came BILLY. This should not have even come out under the name LD and must have been nothing more than a contractual obligation. LD completely changed their sound where they became OFFSPRING clones and created poppy punk. This album sounds absolutely nothing like the LD from the first two albums. This one should have a warning sticker on the cover about the change in musical direction for a metal label to put this out.
4,The Ramones would have liked Lawnmower Deth,"Fast, Ramonish type songs, but they slow down for ""I need to be your MAIN squeeze"", I could almost hear Joey Ramone singing this one... then they start to sound a bit like sham69 on ""Buddy Holly Never wrote a song called we're to punk"" They cover Squeeze with ""Up the Junction"" fast! guess I like this song no matter who sings it so long as it's fast... This band covers well. Funny short dr. demento type cover of purple haze ends the album just before you eject it..."
1,oh crickey...this album sux,I purchased this album when it came out and I was extremely disappointed; now that I'm older I'm revisiting a lot of music to give it another chance...this is one of those that still sucks! Earlier stuff was great.
3,Fun to do,This is a fun way to exercise but due to an ankle problem I can't do it as much as I'd like.
5,Love it!,I really like this dance DVD. It was perfect for me. Definitely would buy it again if I didn't have it!
3,Dance Off the Inches: Country Line Dance Party,"Not at all what I was looking for. I thought it was actually going to be line dancing but it's an exercise video. One of the routines is called ""Brand New Girlfriend"" but doesn't even use that song to dance to. If you are looking for an easy exercise routine then maybe this is for you."
1,Goofy!,"The video is goofy, the setting is pathetic, the music is terrible, and they hardly work your arms at all. The front girl can't dance for anything, and the two in the back are too busy trying to look cutesie! This is the stupidest video I have ever seen!"
3,"Good workout, but really difficult to get into the music.","The workout is called ""country Line Dance Party,"" so I guess I expected music that I could party to. However, this music is really generic with no lyrics, really hard to stay interested in.The workout itself had my heart rate up and you definitely get moving, but I was looking for a real country dance party with actual country dance tunes and that is just not the case."
3,Less workout and less fun than instructor's other line dance party,"I LOVE this instructor's other country line dance party DVD, which I purchased first, but I was a little disappointed with this one. It's less of a workout and a bit more cheesy than the other. It's still a decent product if you enjoy line dancing, but I thought the intensity level was a let down."
1,This sucks...,"The lead singer of this band goes to my college and has been hyping this band forever. They're generic, nothing about them is good. The lyrics are trite, the music isn't technical. This band is nothing more than just another crappy Long Island metalcore band with minimal talent."
4,Solid Reference,"I am using this book in a seminary course, and I find the content to be very useful in placing the prophetic books into context. I will be keeping this book on my shelf as a reference and turning to it to locate the prophetic books in history etc. I am very happy with this book!"
3,Works as expected...,This unit did as to be expected for the price. It was hard to hear with open helments. Radio was good. There are better units on the market for more money that seem to function a little better. Basic communication was there as you would expect and so I didn't give it lower score...wouldn't purchase again though.
3,Good for the price,"I shopped alot of different websites and products, most ranged from $250 to $1200, so when I saw the price on this one I was suspect but tried it, it works really good at speeds under 60mph, over that there is a lot of feedback from the wind, but it still works and you can't beat the price, just FYI we were both wearing full face helmets"
3,Does the Job,"I bought this to use for the intercom function. It works well at speeds below 70mph on a non-touring bike. With a big windscreen and a quiet helmet you would be golden. It is a cheap made unit and I would never get it wet. Switch gear is sticky/problematic at times, but a couple flips and it always takes off. The included headsets are not comfy long term; some modification or upgrade would be in order for heavy saddle time."
1,intercom radio for motorcycles,"The only good thing about the Nady PMC-3X was the velcro to attach the speakers to the helmet. The rest stinks! Poor sound, poor FM radio, cheap connections and no communication above 40 mph. But at least I know what not to buy again."
2,Not too bad,"Bought this unit for use while driving my M35A2. I modified a couple pairs of Peltor ear muffs to fit the speaker and mic portion. Good fit.True, this device is poor quality (crap quality), one has to be patient with it since it will not tolerate ANY abuse.Either way, it works for my intended use and it's a lot cheaper than the alternative $800 intercom system from Peltor.You be the judge; $65 vrs $800. If you have lots of extra money, don't waste your time. If you don't, then put up with a delicate piece of junk. Its working for me.Additionally, if you intend to use the metal belt clip on the back, buy some super glue before using it."
1,"Returned, replaced, returned 2nd one",Great concept. Poor quality. The first unit the volume control did not work. Amazon overnighted a replacement. Second unit worked for one day and the tuner quit working. Returned for refund. Wish it would have worked but I'm not willing to try a third time.
1,bad product,"ordered this product prior to a 2000 mile motorcycle trip. arrive day of departure. no time to install. installed next morning.an unadertrated piece of junk. the fm radio very weak signal... the volumne to the ear piece was inadequate and filled with static, the vox feature was inoperative. return to Amazon. DO NOT BUY this item get the chatterbox...."
4,porsche driver,like many other driver ed instructors i need a good way to talk to my students with helmets on in loud racing cars . the last 2 way intercom i had was 3 times the price of this one and the mic in the head set broke on that one in no time . i have used this one three time now and though it as cheap in price and quality it does work just fine for my needed . so my thinking is if i need to buy a new one ever year it's no big deal at all . my old one only lasted 2 1/2 years and i went thru 4 head sets . i use rechargeable batterys with these intercoms because you do go thru batterys quight fast if you don't . as for the FM radio part of this system well all i have to say about that is any radio of this type is nothing but a joke . it is not better or worse than my walkman of the old days . i can't say how it would do on a motorcycle but for my needs and 60 bucks it's a sore dick deal . you just can't beat it !
1,Motorcylce communications,The idea was terrific but when we put them in our helments they wouldn't stay secure and the microphones were pushed away by the wind. On the highway you could not hear or understand the other person. If you turned up the volume all heard was static and wind noise. It was not as good as it claimed. We returned the item. When we contacted the manufacturer they did not offer any explantion or information.
2,nady pcm-3x motorcycle intercom,"radio doesn't work, intercom is alright, wouldn't buy again, product support sucks."
2,Noisy!,"This thing seems to work best if you're going slow, like under 50mph. Much more than that and the wind interferes with the sound, even with the mic under the face shield."
2,Historically correct,"I have no doubt that this book was well researched however it lacks feeling. It may be the nature of the book that causes this, as there is no real tale to tell unless there are survivors. Most of these disasters had no one left to spin the yarn of what occurred."
2,Anyone got the wrong Manga attached?,"I have an order placed in 2009-Dec and the package received was attaching Manga vol 5 instead of the correct vol 2..Anyone experienced the same problem ?The problem re-occur even Amazon arranged a replacement, so guess it is manufacturer's packing problem..Of course, the DVD itself should be good.. (I already watched the TV version on local TV before)"
1,"Flimsy, cheep","Flimsy, cheep, thin but still not compliant and leaks light. Overpriced at $4.65. Comes in a small envelope with a lot of tape on it. I damaged it when opened the envelope with scissors."
3,"Tom Brown Jr's ""as told to"" authors","Tom Brown Jr. has led a fascinating life due to his tracking skills. Tracker and Search were written with two different authors, and that made all the difference. Tracker is not just an account of an interesting lifestyle, it is a work of literature. The Tracker author told Tom's story with sensitivity, intelligence and depth. I read and reread whole paragraphs because of the beautiful use of language. It was a spiritual/philosophical work and I hated to finish reading it; the images created were so moving. Clearly, Brown knows a whole lot more about tracking than he does writing, which explains the downgrading of the writing and depth of Search."
4,searching for fulfillment,I wasn't sure of what to expect from the book. I love reading Tom Brown's books and about his philosphy. I didn't know anything about this book but simply picked it up and read. It is about his adult early years the travels that would lead him to become the man he is today and set his path for the future. I will read this book again and enjoy it as surely as I did for the first time.
4,important message for kids to know,"Everyone has a story that is made up of lots of things like when they were born, what race they are, who their parents are and lots more. This book is all about race. It teaches us that we are really all the same deep down. Everyone is a person that deserves to be treated with respect no matter what color their skin is.The book is full of colorful images. The book is not too long to read all at once and it has a great message.We would recommend this to teachers and anyone who works with children. The book is a great way to open discussions on racism, and treating others with respect and kindness regardless of who they are, where they live, the color of their skin, or what clothes they wear."
5,Refreshing Teaching Tool,"There is nothing like a thoughtful picture book to inspire rich discussion. LET'S TALK ABOUT RACE, by Julius Lester, is a perfect example. This compelling picture book is a simple, yet elegant, exploration of personal identity. It is easily read in one sitting, and yet the layered illustrations encourage the reader to linger on each page. Julius Lester's well-chosen words, combined with Karen Barbour's extraordinary drawings make this a must-have for schools and libraries."
2,Let's talk about it a little later....,"I think the age for the intended audience is way off. I'm not sure if the publishing company, the author, or Amazon specifies the age range but this book seems suited for older children or children that have already had to deal with racism. I'm glad I read this book before reading it to my kids, ages 5 and 7.Also, the author throwing in unrelated facts, like ""I had a brother who was nine years older than me but he is dead"" seems odd to me and would likely initiate more questions and such.I would urge parents to read the book first to see that it's appropriate for your child(ren)."
4,Let's Talk About Race,"This text is a perfect book to use with third and fourth graders. Students begin to see ""differences"" at this age and Lester teaches his readers that we are all essentially the same, but with our own unique stories. This is a fantastic text to use as a model for creating character maps, personal story maps and creating podcasts for student book talks."
3,THE BEST SOUL COUGHING CD,"Nice try. These guys were trying to mix hip hop, performance poetry, and alt rock.I would say they succeeded at interesting alternative rock performance poetry.But they didn't quite get the hip hop right. the beats are ALL weak versions of that funky drummer beat. and the lead dude might be a poet but he ain't got flows. and the production/mix don't blend the samples with the live performances that good.i would say this ones the best cus the poetry's more on point. later cds his style doesn't progress and he sounds played out. that guys voice is so nasal. he should star in cold medicin commercials.but the beats and the production lock... with no brain."
5,It is a real nice change of pace,I bought Irrestistable Bliss (Soul Coughing's 96 release) and was very impressed with the groups original mix of beats and vocals. I enjoy this CD(Ruby Vroom) even better. It has great songs on it. I can't wait for they're next release.
3,good i guess,Great album by Soul Coughin. The only flaws were that the cd case was not attached to each other. And 1 of the tracks was scratched.
5,It is 5am..and you are listening .to Los Angeles!,"This CD is an absolute MUST for those of you who have ecclectic tastes in music, i.e. an open-mind.These guys put forth the most amazing array of jazz/soul/electronica/rap/spoken word you can imagine. This being the first CD in there catalouge is the roughest, which is good.very very good!Every song is pleasing, big bass, incredible lyrics that paint fantastic pictures and a bit of bizzarre casio-tones thrown in for good measure..just to keep you on your toes.I so wish they hadn't parted ways as the are even more phenomenal live!"
5,Vroom-Vroom,"This is certainly my favorite release by this band. Soul Coughing has become one of my favorite bands--long after it has ceased to be. This CD is immediately enjoyable, and, if not, it will grow on anyone with an open mind for interesting, intelligent music. Their songs may not sound particularly subtle at first, but with repeated listening, the depth and humor embedded in the lyrics and musicianship will be revealed. Nevertheless, I have to say that I take this potent stuff in measured doses. If you are new to these guys, you must hear this CD (or maybe ""Lust in Phaze: The Best of Soul Coughing""). You may or may not regret it, but you will most certainly hear a bit of music to be found nowhere else. Also give a listen to lead singer Mike Doughty's newer solo work: ""Haughty Melodic"" and ""Golden Delicious."""
3,?review?,The first time I heard this album I thought it was little weird. It is a like jazz fuzion with singing. I think they would be cool to see live.
1,Doesn't Run Under OS X,"The title says it all. Despite what Amazon says, the product does not run under Mac OS X. Unless you have a system that can run Classic (OS 9 or lower) do NOT buy this product. Sure it's only seven bucks, but it's seven bucks flushed."
5,Blast from the Past,"Sneakin' Out by Stacy Lattisaw is precisely how I remembered it! The only difference is that when I listened to it back then, I was listening on a vinyl record. Great CD!!!!"
1,Filth,"There's rubbish, and then there's filth. Common rubbish comes from simple ignorance or lack of thought; this is filth that tries purposefully to distort and mislead, made all the more disgusting by the magnitude of the deception and severity of the subject. I read this book out of curiosity and by the end (and it was a struggle to finish), I felt like I'd just taken a bath in sewage. Let me ask this simple question: if you were prosecuting a mass murder case, would you rely on the testimony of the murderer's buddies? I hope not.Take another example of deception. Look at the reviewer ""Gaelle Biernaski""'s comments. It (She? he?) pretends to be quite objective about the subject matter. Yet look at its sole other review where it attacks Iris's Chang work on the Nanking massacre. It is clearly written by a Japanese person with a egocentric and distorted perception of reality. Don't be fooled!"
1,FESS UP JAPAN!,"MIWA, HIROMI AND KENT - GET REAL! JAPAN DID WHAT IT DID AND NO, THIS BOOK IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT IN THE EYES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD! THE NANKING MASSACRE HAPPENED JUST AS HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI HAPPENED AND THE GERMAN DEATH CAMPS AND MANY OTHER HORRIBLE THINGS ""HAPPENED."" THE TRUTH HURTS BUT ACCEPTANCE OF IT, CHANGES THE WAY PEOPLE THINK. DENIAL DOES NOT!"
1,denial,"i really can't believe someone has the nerve to try to deny history. but i can't force a group of people from stepping up and apologize. in fact i do not want cowards to apologize. but first,... they should answer one question. why do every asian in asia, except japanese (well, i don't think they want to consider themselves asian anyways), has so much animosity towards the government of japan and some of its people due mainly to the event of WWII? i wish they stop asking sympathy from the worldover for those two atomic bomb incidences. it is not nice... you simply look like a hippo and an ugly coward."
1,Shameful,"Japan's culture of denial is based on code of shame. Not honor. With too many descendants of war criminals in today's position of power, Japan is dead set on hiding their horrific past. And the growth of ultra-nationalism in Japan is the sign that they didn't learn from history, because they erased that part of history from their academic textbook. It reminds me of George Orwell's 1984."
1,what it means to face facts,"Japan went into China uninvited. When I say ""uninvited"", I have the general masses of China in mind. It is therefore undeniable that Japan be held accountable for any deaths that occurred in the process whether they were accidental or not. It goes without saying that every possible effort should be made to correct any exaggerations (or understatements, perhaps); however, that does not make Japan any less responsible for what happened. All this seems almost axiomatic to me when I put myself in their shoes. I have sneaking suspicions that all these ""revisionist historians"" such as the writers of this book may not like their own country as much as they think they do."
4,I don't think that all are true.,"However, it is persuasive to the insistence.It wonders that all of the review of Amazon of this book are emotionally negative.I feel reviews have some propaganda malice.Reviews have been written with extraordinary enthusiasm.It is very funny."
1,"Whoever betrays the history, he is going to be punished.","If Amazon had negative ratings, I do select them. If a book goes far away from the truth, whether it still worths reading?! Whoever betrays the history, he is going to be punished."
1,Do not read this book of lies,It is pathetic that anyone would deny what the Japanese did in Nanking. But this is typical of the Japanese government and people who refuse to admit how vicious and brutal a people they can be. They look even more pathetic when they try to deny what everyone else in the world knows is true. This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. Do not waste one penny on it.
1,The Last Straw,"This is it. Because of the lies in this book, I plan to sell all my Japanese products and never buy them again."
1,"I do not want to give any star, stupid amazon",I can not believe amazon is selling this book. It is cocain to Japanese.
2,Too contraversal,There are so much contraversal issues surrounding the Nanking incident.The book is well explained but many areas are still puzzling to readers
1,Bastards,"After i read the book, i was wondering why the asian population should ever forgive japan. Even in the principals of christianity, repentance comes before forgiveness. Think about the little children boiled alive, think about the human experiments, think of the millions of lost souls. It's been over half a century, and those bastards still haven't the guts to say ""we did it""."
2,Livro de Exercicios,"I previously purchased Portugus Básico Para Estrangeiros, which is okay but I was disappointed in that the exercises in the book did not have any answers at the back of the book. So, I ordered the Livro De Exercícios, hoping that this book might at least have answers to the exercises in it. Sadly, it does not have any answers. I appear to have wasted my money buying this skimpy 109-page book which is a compilation of more exercises but with no answers. This may be okay for an instructor who likes to keep the answers secret but is very unnerving for someone who wants to study ahead on his own and is unsure if he or she has answered the exercises correctly."
5,Absolutely beautiful!! Are there more CDs available?,"My daughter was at a local bookstore with her Dad and this CD happened to be playing in the background. He was so taken by it that he asked at the front desk if they had a copy for sale. I had a hard time giving it back after he loaned it to me! ;-) This is the kind of CD that even though you may not think you're a fan of piano music, this will definitely change your mind. Some of these songs actually moved me to tears (I know, sappy, same thing with Irish/Celtic music!).This would make wonderful night-time music for kids... very mellow and flowing. Excellent background music."
5,An unforgettable delight.,"I read this book in 1986, having borrowed a copy from the Public Library in Bristol, UK. I was immediately and totally enraptured by the world portrayed below Plum Lake. I felt then and now that this is how the world ought to have been! I can't explain it but I just can't get this book out of my head and have been desperately searching for a copy for about 3 years now, as I feel something approaching an urgent need to re read it. I was stunned to see a copy listed on the Amazon web site but so disappointed that it is out of print. I am also amazed to see that I am not the only one on whose imagination this book has made such an astounding impact.If anyone can get hold of a copy PLEASE let me know!"
4,Great read for middle schoolers,The book is best read slowly and savored like a perfect favorite piece of chocolate or favorite recipe. The colors and watery images are ideal for an art project.
2,one of the worst and most horribly inaccurate Alamo movies..,"EVER!!! first of all, Crockett didn't wear a cowboy hat. he wore a conskin hat and fought till the end with his rifle. in this movie, Crockett has a knife. 2nd of all, they use the same battle scenes over and over. they aren't even original. they took the charge scene from the 1959 Alamo movie, The Last Command! and if you look closely at Travis, he kills the guy the same way about 3 times. this movie is just plain horrible! i only give it 2 stars because it's about the alamo. but don't waste your time on this movie. it's horrible! you want a good Alamo movie, watch John Wayne's ""The Alamo"" or go to the IMAX theatre and watch, Alamo: The Price of Freedom."
2,Not worth the money,Not a good representation of the history of the Alamo. It had the feel of a made-for-tv movie with a soapy predictable plot.
2,"""Alamo""? , or Just a funny western spoof.","This movie had little thought of anything but to make a buck. A movie is a way to pass the time, and this one sure delievers. Which is not a bad think, but for a young kid or of those lacking, it posses a real threat to understanding and correlating historical events. In the making of this movie the producers even trashed the film by using the Hildago flag which was way back around 1800 and nothing to do with Alamo ,but confuse things a bit more. The REAL FLAG of the ALAMO for 176 years remains in MEXICO CITY on display for all the world to see in THE NATIONAL MUSEUM of MEXICO. It's a shamefull thing to not only hide HISTORY but to CHANGE history for a purpose of personnal gain... well that's just a crime. In fact TEXAS has been trying for 60 YEARS to get the ""TRUE"" Alamo flag back . Even two PRESIDENTS of the UNITED STATES have tried...""WHAT PRESIDENT"" you say? Take your pick... they're both named BUSH."
2,Made for Texas' 150th Birthday,"This movie was a made for TV film to help celebrate the 150th anniversity of Texas' Independence. It is more factual than the other Alamo movies but it is too drawn out at times and still failed to get all of the facts straight. For its length, the characters are not developed too well. Another problem is that the Hispanic soldiers at the Alamo are not represented well. There were many Tejano soldiers at the battle yet Juan Seguin and Gregorio Esparza are the only two with much screen time. The final battle sequence was not too bad but if you look close enough, there are too many single shot guns being fired more than once without them being reloaded. The movie could have been better considering some of the talent found in the film."
2,"A low budget, made-for-TV film.","It was filmed on the same set as John Wayne's ""The Alamo,"" it uses stock footage from ""The Last Command,"" and it reshows the same action scenes over and over again to flesh out the rather weak looking battle. There was not much of a budget for this movie.Yes, this movie is more historically accurate than virtually all the other cinematic Alamo versions. (Is that really saying much?) But artistically it is at the bottom of the barrel. Acting wise, the only real bright spot of the movie is young Alec Baldwin's Travis.Watch for Ethan Wayne, the Duke's youngest son, in a bit role as an Alamo defender. (He is wearing a coonskin cap that is identical to the one his father wore in his Alamo movie.) Also James Arness, who plays Bowie, was the Duke's first choice to play that same role in ""The Alamo."" Arness had to pass due to prior commitments."
4,"not as epic as john wayne's ""the alamo"" this is a very good more personal version and it's a nice change of pace","james arness is jim bowie,brian keith is davy crockett,alec baldwin is will travis,and in a move that most films about the alamo never do the late raul julia is santa anna.much smaller in scale than the movies,and useing footage from the film ""the lost command"",this is more about the effect of the seige than just the battle. it is a little slow ,but as the title says it lasted 13 days,and really i found it quite good. one draw back and the reason for only 4 instead of 5 stars is the over use of stock footage and the reuseing of some of the same footage over and over again,travis kills the same soldier at least 3 times and it is clear that it's just the same shot used again.with just that one little problem i have to say that this is a fine film and i do recommend it."
2,cliched,"I found this to be an overall disappointing movie despite some added historical accuracy towards the subject than earlier efforts (eg, the attack began before dark, etc) and also more from the Mexican point of view. The stream of on screen deaths were Hollywoodish to say the least at the end. It's a bit saddening to me that in ended this way. It was a good cast (for a TV movie) but the climax was weak. I was surprised that through all the casualties the Mexicans took, you saw very few actually fall!"
1,Didn't work for me,"This sounded promising, but did not work for my tinnitus. Still searching for a legitimate product.Product tastes like sugar."
5,Nice Tool,This embosser is a great scrapbooking and cardmaking tool. It eliminates the need for an expensive light box. It also is very easy to use and nicely secures the paper for a great result every time.
5,BILL GAITHER PRESENTS ERNIE HAASE AND SIGNATURE SOUND,I LOVED THE VIDEO. THE GROUP IS SO FULL OF ENERGY AND SING GREAT. NOT YOUR EVERY DAY QUARTET. I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT.
5,Really saweet,"This thing is so kewl. I am new to the Jeep Wrangler bit. Just purchased my first one and I am now hooked. Never even heard of this little tool, but now that I own some I would highly recommend them. So easy to use just hope they can live up to the resistance. Only time will tell."
3,great addition to tow/rescue strap,great addition to tow/rescue strap to make a simple variable solution for unique tug and tows.Comes with a sample photo card to demonstrate options depending on strap location needs.
5,Well made,Nice and light. When offloading always looking to save weight when I can. Product is a great little tool and weighs next to nothing
2,Boring,"Unlike others, I cannot be excited about this CD. It is a wallpaper music CD indeed with pieces that are WAY too familiar. The flute is sometimes so high that it makes you want to turn down the volume, or even stop the CD player. I played it once, and won't play it again I am afraid. I give it a 2 stars because the musician is probably an accomplished flutist."
4,One of the few female engines,"And Molly is not portrayed stereotypically. She is as capable physically as the boys. She's a good choice, for a second or third tier engine."
3,nice color,"I got this toy for my two boys and they like it, the price is cheaper than Toysrus and the free shipping makes it a good buy."
4,Great Holiday Gift Brought Back Many Memories.,Thank you this purchase was made just in time for the holidays and the great price was perfect for my budget my friend loved it. It brought back many memories for her thanks Amazon.
2,It was a piece of crap. PIECE OF CRAP!,"I'm a huge Neil Young fan and when I read some of the bad reviews I didn't believe them. I thought Neil Young could never make such a bad album, but he did. Two good or decent songs on the album. Would I recommend this cd? No. Should you buy it if your a huge Neil Young fan? Yes. Don't let people tell you if somethings bad, find out yourself. The whole album is muffled and your forced to blast it. If you want a good Neil Young album buy Mirror Ball."
3,Worthy 90's Neil.,"This is an album I got pretty much right when it came out, and still play it fairly often. Now it seems to have become one of his forgotten discs, but there is some good stuff on here. ""Prime Of Life"" follows the simple opener ""My Heart"" nicely. ""Western Hero"" might be my favorite track, and actually does sound like a western song. Then there's ""Change Your Mind"", which I think was the single, but this version is nearly 15 minutes long. We also get ""Train Of Love"", which is roughly the same song as ""Western Hero"", but with different lyrics. One other thing to mention, is that despite being backed by Crazy Horse on this album, the only real rocker is ""Piece Of Crap"". The rest of the album is fairly dark and mellow, though good. Overall I hesitate to call ""Sleeps With Angels"" essential, but it is a must for fans of this era."
5,neil young's best album ever,"I own all of Neil Young's CDs and I think this is by far the best album made. Prime of Life, as well as his tribute to Kurt Cobain's death, Sleeps with Angels, are outstanding. I am going to his concert in the Gorge on Sept 9 and can only hope he plays songs off this wonderful album!!"
4,Not for the new fans...,"It has taken a few years to really respect this album. Neil can take you to a deeper level once you are ready. If you have listened to Harvest and Harvest Moon one million times and want to take a new trip, plug this one in."
2,Neil at his most boring...,"I love most of Neil's albums but this particular one never get's off the ground. The first three songs (my heart, Prime of Life and Driveby) give great promises...but unfortunately the rest of the album just let's you down. A prime example is Western Hero - has Neil ever written a song this banal? Well sure he has, but he has probably never put this many banalities on one album before. The entire second half of this CD is not only annoying - it'll put you right to sleep...!"
1,A big dissapointment,"Ironically, the best song on this album is titled ""Piece of Crap"". Ironic, because the rest of the album is basically that. I've listened to it several times figuring it might grow on me. Nothing grew at all. Some songs move as slow as a glacier. A tribute to Kurt Cobain it may be, but a dull tribute it is, indeed."
5,Excellant!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author provides theories from different points of view to explain how the magic works and lots and lots of practical exercises. He details what he has done and how it has turned out, but encourages the reader to take what he has done and build on it. He provided ideas that I would not have thought of; practices that can easily be added to anyone's daily routine. And he can write! I have purchased a few books from other authors in this genre and not all can."
4,Fantastic,"Whilst I've been underwhelmed by some of Taylor's other work, this book is tour de force. Worth it for the elements on art alone. Fantastic"
2,Get this out of my CD player!,"Okay, I'll admit I bought my first REM CD because I liked the song ""Losing My Religion,"" so I guess you wouldn't call me a fan. ""Out of Time"" turned out to be quite good. So, being a big concert goer, I bought tickets to their 1995 concert just after the release of ""Monster."" I figured that since I was going to the show, I ought to buy the CD so I could sing along. It was all right the first time through... interesting, coffee-shop type music. Then I listened to it again. About two songs into it, I ripped my headphones off and pulled the CD out of the player when I realized just how annoying it was. I haven't heard it since. Luckily, I found someone who would buy my tickets and I went to the KMFDM show instead. I agree with another critic of this CD in that it is the worst REM I have ever heard..."
3,It barely made it.,"My product was a CD sent by mail and was supposed to be sent in bubble-wrap. If it had been in wrap there would have been little or no problems. However the casing was cracked and the internal brace was broken to pieces. I was horrified and only give this a good review because technically the CD was in perfect shape. You can guess the problem, no bubble wrap. None, not even a little. I just can't store it. Anyway, I won't buy from them again. The whole thing is there are answers people, they are called bubble-envelopes, if you are in the business, use them."
2,...,"I really liked Automatic for the People, but monster is nothing like AFTP. I think it is a well made album, but this album is heavier the the others, I was disappointed, not their best"
1,They should be ashamed,The star has fallen. This album is terrible. Particularly considering their musical history and their past potential for creativity and great song writing. Do NOT buy this album.
3,wasted potential,"this album had the potential to be the best rock n roll album of the nineties - noisy, sparsely produced and and a big 'up yours' to their own bosses at warner. however, it was rushed. the only reason it didnt come out as it might. the best song from the monster sessions didnt make the album (revolution), though there are some decent efforts like kenneth, strange currencies, tongue, i took your name, let me in, star 69. had the band waited another year, taken their time and done it right, i wouldnt be just as negative. look at it this way - take the best guitar rock songs from monster (the ones i mention above), add them to the likes of departure, low desert, binky the doormat and so fast so numb from new adventures in hi-fi, and you would have without a doubt an amazing rock album. saving grace? the artwork from the album which i absolutely love!"
4,Sexy hard-edged REM,"Ignore the negative reviews, this is a great album. You'll be humming ""Kenneth..."", ""Crush With Eyeliner"" and ""Bang and Blame"" over and over after listening to this wonderful CD. A must-own for any REM fan, and any fan of edgy alternative rock."
4,Monster,"Monster being Rem's 9th studio album and 1994 release and the sound is alternative rock and is very good release. This is not simple radio friendly music but a bit more demanding. Rolling Stone gave the album 4.5/5 and Allmusic 2.5/5. I am in between a give it a 4. The best tracks on this release are ""What's The Frequency, Kenneth"" and ""Crush With Eyeliner"". 4/5."
2,I think they regret this one,"Clearly the worst R.E.M. album, ""Monster"" probably deserves 2.5 stars or even three, but it's been overpraised here, so there you go. I don't mind a band trying new things -- in fact, I encourage it -- but they also must play to their strengths at least a little, and this album does anything but. Most of the songs, drenched in a fuzzy crunch of sound, just sit there, absolutely grooveless. The first three songs --""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"", ""Crush With Eyeliner"" and ""King of Comedy"" felt like a bad dream when I first heard them. The album gets better, and familiar R.E.M. attributes do crop up. ""I Don't Sleep, I Dream"" is nice, the countryish lilt of ""Strange Currencies"" work surprisingly well, ""Bang and Blame"" is flat-out great, and ""Let Me In"" is subtly harrowing. I do like the pummeling ""Circus Envy"" too -- one of the few fuzzed-up bashers here that works. All in all, disappointing, but there are flashes of brilliance here and there."
2,"Lots of Distortion, Not Much Music","I bought everything they did from Murmur up to AFTP. When I heard Monster, I liked WTFK, but then there was nothing tuneful after that. If you liked grunge, this is great, but if you like good tunes, then you want the earlier REM albums."
4,underrated,"Now, many people disliked this album. I think that monster just was a departure from rem's previous work, like automatic for the people, green and out of time. I really think that if more people just listened to this album through they really wound less to dislike about it. The album does flow from one song to another song really. Songs like strange currencies and I don't sleep I dream are really well written."
4,Very underrated,"I'll keep this short but I have to say this is my favorite REM album and I have all of the 80's ones up to this one. Peter Buck really really shines here with some wonderful fuzzy, distorted guitar and Stipe contributes great lyrics and vocals as usual. The 1st two tracks are my favorites but its all high quality music to me. So I agree with the reviewer that says give this album a chance and listen with an open mind. I highly recommend it!"
1,The beginning of the end,"This is probably the most worthless album REM ever put out. The songs are badly written, mostly constructed around punk and grunge cliches. Most of the songs have no real melody, and the ones that do have melodies sound exactly like previous REM songs. REM, in spite of their protests to the contrary, were never a punk band, and this album proves it. This was the beginning of a long downturn for REM from which they have not yet recovered; in this reviewer's opinion, they should have broken up after ""Automatic For The People."""
3,2 1/2 stars,"I appreciate that REM went 180 degrees from AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE (still their best album) by lashing out with a sonic assault and some of the stuff on here is good songwriting. FREQUENCY, STAR 69 and STRANGE CURRENCIES are standouts, but the same reverb on every song? Come on, guys. I know you're pals with Thurston Moore, but jeez.....There's been a lot of talk about STRANGE CURRENCIES being another version of EVERYBODY HURTS but not as many people mention that BANG AND BLAME is a reverb-attacked LOSING MY RELIGION with different lyrics. Unlistenable.Ultimately, the follow-up album NEW ADVENTURES IN HI-FI is the bridge between MONSTER and AUTOMATIC. HI-FI also marks what I consider to be the end of REM, sadly.MONSTER is great for completists or if you want some raucus over-loud 70's throwback music for party background, but it's far from REM's best."
2,REM's worst album,"If there are a glut of these CDs on the used market, it's because it's just not a good album. I'm an REM fan, and I own nearly all of their CDs and this one is far and away my least favorite. There are a couple of decent tracks on here. I actually think ""What's Your Frequency, Kenneth?"" is a bit OVERrated, but it's not bad. ""Bang and Blame"" is pretty good, but it's not worth suffering through the rest of the album to get there. Repetitive lyrics, repetitive songs, and entirely too much distortion make this one to pass."
1,Horrendous,"OK. I love R.E.M....but they just don't know how to play hard, driving rock. They shouldn't try. This attempt sounds hollow and contrived; it lacks the force of other bands (Nirvana, etc.) who really know how to handle this stuff. This sort of rock requires something more than a lot of noisy guitars...it sounds more like a stodgy adult's version of hard rock than a real version."
1,Utter Crap,"Oh brother. R.E.M. does grunge. As if grunge needed another contributor to its sorry genre. If you want to hear R.E.M. rock hard, get Dead Letter Office and hear their version of Toys In The Attic. Or better yet, get Lifes Rich Pageant and hear Begin The Begin or I Believe. This album sucks. Hard. Really hard. I bought it, listened to it once, and it has not come out of its jewel case since. And this is coming from someone who was a big, big fan of R.E.M. during the I.R.S. years."
1,Weak,"This album is weak, REM has always been a bastion for collegiate faux-intellectuals. Until after this album, when they were picked up by post-collegiate faux-intellectuals. Mmmm, sounds good in the old SUV with those fading memories of talking bad about Reagan at those keg parties in '88. This album is a sad cash-in on grunge... REM cranks up the gain on the old amps and some mistake that for power. Please. Their earlier albums are of course better, but not much. If you want intellectual stimulation, go read a book. If you want rock music, look elsewhere."
5,Absolutely Wonderful Album,"Yes, this album is quite different from their previous albums, but it is still a great album."
3,A Good Effort With A Few Standouts,"This is an interesting album although I don't think it is particularly consistent in quality. The best song on the CD (for once) was the big hit: ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"" is both lyrically and musically strong. Other strengths include ""Crush With Eyeliner,"" and the strange glam-grunge blend tribute to Kurt Cobain featuring an odd but fitting musical dyspepsia, ""Let Me In."" I also find ""Tongue"" intriguing, although I can't understand all of the lyrics, and the delicate texture of the song seems out of place on this album.This is neither the best nor the worst from R.E.M., but seems perhaps the most controversial due to the inconsistent quality of some of the songs. I think that ""Monster"" is certainly worth a listen, but R.E.M. fans will likely not find it to be their favorite, and non-R.E.M. fans will likely not be converted."
4,Monster is a monster :P,"Wow, I have just started listening to REM maybe a few weeks ago. I know I missed the main stream times when they were extremely popular but who cares. I started off listening to songs off of their greatest hits cd and I was blown away by some of them like Pop Song 89 and The Great Beyond. So I started digging deeper to find better material and then I found Monster. I haven't heard everything from REM yet, but so far Monster is by far my favorite cd from them with songs like Crush with Eyeliner, King of Comedy and Circus Envy. This is truly a unique band."
4,A good effort,"In this album release, REM distanced themselves from the pop/jangle sounds and concentrated on a more rock feel and sound. The experimentation was successful and REM re-emerged as a serious rock band in this CD.I for one, enjoyed this style of REM over previous albums because I am more of a rock band. Some great songs, not hits, but well worth spinning this CD in the player."
3,"Well, it closes on the right note","This CD contains perhaps R.E.M.'s finest single track, and yet I can only give the album 3 stars--which goes to show how disappointing the album truly is.The great song in question? Well, it's none other than the closing track, a song called ""You."" Now if you've never heard this album, then you probably haven't heard the song since it got absolutely no radio play. So let me tell you a bit about this tune. It is simply the most psychadelic-sounding song to come around since XTC became The Dukes Of Stratosphear in the mid-80's. Picture an industrial-sounding ""Time Has Come Today"" (by the Chambers Brothers) and you get some idea. If you're familiar with ""Lotus"" off R.E.M.'s Up album, then you might have some idea of what I'm talking about, although that tune doesn't quite hit the mark as well as this one.As for the rest of Monster, mediocre R.E.M. at best."
2,my worthless two cents,"the most popular bargain bin album of all time!why? well, simply, it's just not a very good album. in fact, it's the same record that made me hate the band for a few years before i started listening to their earlier stuff (well, that, and the fact that i grew up in macon georgia, and REM was everywhere you turned). but it was 5 bucks as well, and there are at least 4 quality tracks on here, so i picked it up."
3,An enjoyable sidetrip,"This is not R.E.M.'s best album, lets get that out of the way. It is however, a solid album. The band was ready to get back to the business of being a rock band after two excellent acoustic/mid tempo albums (Out of Time and Automatic For The People). Standouts on the album include ""What's The Frequency, Kenneth?"", ""Crush With Eyeliner"", ""I Don't Sleep, I Dream"", ""Tongue"" and ""Let Me In"". However ""Circus Envy"" and ""I Took Your Name"" are possibly the two weakest songs R.E.M. have ever included on an album, the latter is OK live but doesn't make the grade on the record. This album provides a nice detour every once in a while if you are a fan of the band."
3,Disappointing . . .,"After releasing Auotmatic for the People, Monster is a let-down. Yes, it was going to be very hard to achieve as much with this release as the previous, but the new direction that the band has taken here is disappointing. They have cast aside all that made the previous three albums special to take on a bold new approach and it was a failure. Although there are winners like ""What's the frequency, Kenneth?"", ""Strange Currencies"" and the moving tribute to Kurt Cobain ""Let me in"", these tracks are diamonds in the deep rough."
1,Disappointing,"REM's ""Monster"" was very disappointing. When I got to know REM, thru ""Automatic for the People"" (magnificent) and ""Out of Time"" (very good), I then wanted to own everything they'd recorded. My journey so far:Murmur (uninteresting) ... Life's Rich Pageant (worthwhile) ... Dead Letter Office (worthwhile, fun) ... Document (better, including the great ""It's the End of the World as We Know It"") ... Green (I only liked ""Stand"" and ""Orange Crush"")REM has produced some magnificent songs (""Everybody Hurts"" ... ""Losing My Religion"" ... ""Man on the Moon"" ... ""The Great Beyond"" ... and maybe ""Nightswimming"").I'll likely give ""Monster"" another listen, maybe twice more, then probably I'll give it to charity. Maybe it's because I'm old (44) and REM's audience is young - I don't know. ""Murmur"" was voted one of the best rock albums of all time, and I didn't like it at all. Similarly, I am a big fan of Van Morrison, but his famous ""Astral Weeks"" album I found unappealing. Go figure."
4,More Growl Than Roar With Monster,"REM turns the amps to 11,chuck the mandolins,and sing about sex,fame,& power(""Ziggy Stipedust""?).Monster may be the REM CD that fills most used CD sections,but it's a brave piece of work that continue to amaze,yet puzzle some.Those who jumped on the Losing My Religion-bandwagon,will jump right off(I must admit I'm one of those,but it made me check out their earlier albums,and I've been a devoted fan ever since).What's The Frequency,Kenneth kicks it into high gear,while Crush With Eyeliner take the Aladdin Sane-esque route.Bang & Blame,King of Comedy,Let Me In and You makes this album a worthwhile collection.Although with all the overdrive in the guitars,the rhythm section sounds kind of flabby in the middle,especially compared to Pearl Jam & Nirvana.But you know its REM ,always doing it their way."
1,Still haven't received it one month later!,"I'd love to review it, but I am still waiting to receive it an entire month later. When I bought it, it was supposedly in stock."
4,Pictures not words,"This book is an insightful look at Lee Freidlander's images of Lee Freidlander, I cannot review this book without bias, as I have always been a big fan of Mr Freidlanders work. GREAT BOOK!"
4,Live & Be Well,This book was recommended by my Rabbi for our discussion group.It has proven very interesting and has been an interesting tool.The book arrived speedily and in excellent condition.
4,My 16 yr Old loves it,I purchased this comic book for my 16 yr old son. He loves these types of books and cant seem to get enough of them. He is loves all Japanese animation be it cartoons on tv or books.
4,Jandd Touring Handle Pack 2,"I have purchased Jandd products in the past and this is one of their best. It has plenty of room for gear and it will keep it off your back (pack,messenger bag).I ride with a Jandd Rear Rack Pack also. Its not as large as a full touring set-up , but great for the city commuter. This model has a great quick release system to keep it out in front and away from your brake lines. I attach my Cat-Eye headlight to my fork so there is no problem. HAPPY SAFE RIDING! ~ K"
1,);,They show an elegant cover yet i got a cover that though nice is NOT the same as the rest of the series I bought for my sister. It was sent on time and in pretty good conditioning so kudos for that. Hopefully returning it though.
2,My least favorite in the series,My Review:This book is my least favorite so far in the Betsy-Tacy series. I just could not get into it. Betsy has grown in to such a silly girl. Her sister goes off to school and is pledging a sorority and she decides to start her own. This is when all her troubles start. She starts acting out in school and makes silly remarks. Some of the dialogue could not possibly be one of a 16 yr old girl. I guess times have changed since the writing of this book. Betsy was Junior just bored me a little. It took me the whole week to read it. I am moving on to Betsy and the Great World since I do not have Betsy and Joe in my possession. I also could not possibly take any more of her high school years.
3,some reservations,"I purchased this book for a 12 year old child. The subject matter is great, the writing stylish. However, there is a graphic description of a ""spanking"" in the first few pages that is quite disturbing and should have been left out."
5,Should Have Bought This First,I started out with the Nancy Calthorpe book but later bought this one because I was left with too many unanswered questions. I would choose this as a first purchase if you are interested in teaching yourself to play the harp. There are some good tunes in this book as well.
4,Excellent for starters,"I started with Betty Paret's first harp book which was excellent for a couple of weeks. I needed Etudes to practice hard fingering postitions which for a starter were very challenging, and couln't produce nice sounding music without being trained on them. Laurie's book was excellent for that purpose, provided exercises for practice without the frustration of ""cannot do the fingering"" ... I wouldn't give it 5 stars because I needed CD to demonstrate the music parts. Still need them."
3,Assumes you know a lot,"I already can read music from playing piano, and I still find this book a bit more than ""beginner"". The very first piece has you playing both hands together, which is very difficult for a beginner to figure out how to balance the harp this way, and hold your hands properly etc. However, I will definitely use this book as an ""advanced beginner"" book!"
2,Begineer's harp - ughh!,"Riley rates quite poorly in writing a ""beginner's"" harp book. She uses an archaic method dating from the days of caste systems, when harpists were often blind people, playing by ear and touch. Most beginner's would give it up after a few lessons from this type of method and teacher. I myself, learned a harp technique from a Russian method, and I can tap an Irish reel out, while Riley would probably be fumbling around in the dark."
4,"Emma, Smith, My Story",The volume was recorded too low. I had to turn the volume up all the way just to barely hear it. It took away from the movie because of this.The story is very interesting but hard to hear.
4,Good movie!,"It's a good movie, sweet. I watched it with my fiancee, and she got a bit teary in the first few minutes. =) I did not expect the portrayal format of the movie (I.E. vignettes) and that was all I didn't really like about it. But it is still wonderful."
2,Emma Smith My Story,"Production values are good (I believe this shares some scenes with ""Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Revelation), but the narrative is painfully slow and the message heavy-handed. This is unlikely to appeal to many but the most devout mormons. Others looking for a movie about mormon history would be better off withThe Work and the Gloryand its sequels."
5,Exceptionally Done,This is a beautiful masterpiece of Emma Smith's life. She was one amazing women and this DVD is a tribute to her wonderful life of service and love. It is very professionally done.
5,I've Got to Have It!,Oh...mah gosh! I've got to have this cd! Sheezh! Why I gotta be live'n in the EASTCOAST! But....imma get this cd! :):):):)
3,Smooth R & B,Very smooth track from Drew & Co. Can anyone tell me where I can find the house mix? It's not the one on the CD.
3,Fantastic Slow Jam Classic,"Smooth R&B ballad, kinda reminds me of Earth Wind and Fire's classic, ""After the Love is Gone"" in terms of both music and lyrical subject matter. It's been a while since I've heard something this good in this particular genre.Could use a true dance mix for the clubs in place of the ones featured on this single, however. They just don't hit hard enough to dance to."
1,Okay camera but blurry pics,"Received the camera but had to return. The photo quality was poor, blurry, and not even as good as my cell phone. Maybe it is because of 3.1 pixel. Anyhow returned and ordered a Canon 7.1 which is great. Still used Amazon because of their wonderful customer service."
4,Entertaing as hell but is all science fiction.,"The idea of gods or alliens beings roaming the planet is not new at all. Books from Zecharia Sitchin, Arthur Vonshtain and so on talk about gods/aliens for a long time now. The question is do you think like Erich Von Daniken that aliens are your friends, or do you think of aliens like Zecharia Sitchin that they manipulated our DNA to create a worker? or maybe you are like me and think like Arthur Vonshtain who repitedly states that alliens are the dark side and people are the light. One day we will face the dark side and we will prevail- and light will rule for all eternity!Addition on 12/27/11I wanted to point out on disc 3, geese are being said to be a flying UFO. It all happens in Iceland in April.. the shape is also true to geese and other birds going south :]"
3,Interesting Concepts!,"Although Morgan Freeman wouldn't have been my first choice, he does pose some interesting questions and concepts. This first in the series is not the most fascinating though."
1,Humans: too dumb and inept to do anything without alien help!,"This series has the dubious honor of being the single stupidest thing I've ever seen on television. It leaps from one unspeakably absurd idea (the great pyramid was a nuclear power plant!) to another (the moon is a Star Wars-like death star!) with gleeful insanity. By the time they got to the part about the Ark of the Covenant being hidden in the Oak Island Money Pit, I had to conclude that the writers of this show were actually mocking their credulous audience.Essentially, if you are the kind of person who regularly writes rambling letters to your newspaper about fluoridation and your neighbor's cat's mind control rays, this is the documentary for you."
5,"Assistance in the Darker Days, Ancient Aliens-Amazon","This DVD appears to be a more modern version of ""Chariots Of The Gods"" by Erich von Daniken. This just convinces me all the more that our development as human's was seeded by what we call aliens. I'd like to think they come from our deepest ocean trenches and that the first aliens may have been called Atlanteans. This DVD just gets me to thinking of possibilities of what may have transpired in the past."
5,chariots of the gods /ancient aliens/ancient aliens season 2,"out of this world, if you still have any doubts that we are not alone in the universe, and that there was no outside influence to help ancient civilization (man kid) construct these great cities,temples/monoliths/religious sites etc, some examples being:- stone hinge, the pyramids and so forth, then you are living with your heads buried deep in the ground.Look up and see the wonders,vastness of our universe,and at the same time look around you and see the unexplained wonders hear on planet earth. don't go to your graves thinking well may be? there could be life out there,We are products of star dust!God descended from the heavens,and the one thing that we can all be curtain of is death! God willing we will all return to the heavens."
4,My favorite series on TV,Love this show and its great to have a piece of word from the late Philip Coppens. I really enjoy this product.
2,I returned them,"I decided to return these gloves. They were really small even for my short fingers. I also found out that I prefer the 12 oz weight. Nothing terrible about them, but I've like other glvoes from Top Contender better."
1,Completely Wrong,This book is completely overpriced. My brother this is the deen of Peace. We are here to assist mankind not rob them. What makes your book so expensive. Contact me @ jwebster54@gmail.com. As salaam u laikum.
3,This isn't Vol 2!!!!!!!!!!!,"I own Ghetto Brawls and I must say this isn't the follow up to the 1st Ghetto Brawls!!!! I bought this item last week thinking it was the second edition and when I finally recieved it, I was SOOOOOO Dam MAD!!!! It's the same disc I already own. I don't know why this IDIOT puts Vol. 2 on the title when it's not Volume 2. I think this person is doing this so he can sell the 1st series. If you don't own the first Ghetto Brawls yet then save your money. Most of the fights on here are so weak. There are only 2 good fights on here and they happen to be between girls. Sorry to disappoint."
4,Love Sanborn and his sound,"If your just getting into jazz then you must try Sanborn..He's the cream of most crops. If you've like jazz for awhile but hadn't experienced Sanborn then this is a great cd to add to your collection. I only give it four stars because I didnt, as usual, absolutely love every piece. However Sanborn's talent and the recording quality are always five stars."
3,PRETTY DISAPPOINTED,"I love musicians who talk through their instruments. On KENNY LOGGINS' VOX HUMANA-Album there was that heart-touching SAX-Solo which is still, after all the years, giving me goose-pimples. It was the first time I recognized DAVID SANBORN. Since I was looking for something else than GROOVER WASHINGTON Jr. or SPYRO GYRA (there is not much of market for that kind of music here) I bought this BEST OF... and could find only a little bit of that soul in LESLEY ANN and CARLY'S SONG. The rest is average. Maybe there is more to find in his other albums - I will find out."
1,"For all Michael Bolton fans, you deserve this!","This is just another compilation of mediocrity. Maybe he played with more soul than Kenny G, but what turns me off is the simplicity of his music, generally repeating few of his most effective riffs which sounded really boring and irritable. Let's not talk about spirituality, there's not even an ounce of lyricism and maturity in his music. I understand he could play louder or sharper than any musician in the Jazz scene, but that's not the point, it will only make some cats and dogs begging for the noise to stop. It doesn't really matter if anybody wants to call this Jazz or not, but this is simply garbage. Save the money and get ""Blue Train"" instead, this is a waste of time and money."
1,Another piece of junk from a bad sax player.,"Ok, actually Sanborn is less bad than some in the Smooth jazz world, take for instance the man with a 5 note soprano arsenal: KG. If you really want to hear someone play alto sax, listen to someone like Charlie Parker, or Cannonball Adderley, or Jackie McLean."
2,Third Ear Band - 'Brain Waves' (Materiali Sonori) 2 1/2 stars,"An okay, later day 1993 effort by the always 'experimental' Third Ear Band. Obviously,not as good as their eariler works like their self-titled lp or 'MacBeth' (see my reviews of both). But for the asking price, 'Brain Waves' would be worth checking out for yourself. Most semi-impressive tracks here are ""Dance With Dolphins"", the very English folk-sounding ten-minute ""Water Into Wine"" and the tribal ""Psychedelic Trance Dance"". Line-up: (seems that a few of these members play OTHER instruments on other TEB discs) Mick Carter-guitar, Glen Sweeney-percussion, Neil Black-violin and Lyn Dobson-synthesizer,flute&vocal. Some interesting sounds, no doubt."
3,NICE LITTLE TALE BUT A DISAPPOINTING FINISH,"Interesting tale with good characterization, nicely plotted, excellent feel of time and place but does not deliver an ending worthy of the trip. This is the first Barnard book that has been a let down, and I have read most of his novels.If you are looking for a GREAT Barnard read, I suggest you try ""Fatal Attachments"". It is an older book but worth your time and trouble."
3,Didn't care who dun it,"This book dealt more with the narrators state of mind than with the actual mystery. I realize the hero gets involved in uncovering the truth because of where the ""body"" was found, but I was very bored by his thought process. The main character was boring, and lacked any sense of humor. I didn't get a warm feeling from his interaction with other characters in the book, and that made his search for the truth unbelievable to me. And I hate unmentioned characters who show up at the end! This is not a plot twist, it's just the authors way of ""stumping"" the reader.This isn't a bad book. I just wouldn't classify this as a mystery."
3,There are much better out there,"I bought this set after losing my first ""rush"" stamp somehow at the office. The first one we used for months with no problems (different company) but THIS one runs out of ink pretty quickly. It doesn't re-ink well between uses, either... from one sheet to another it will look fine and then a lot of the ink will be missing the second page and it gets worse the more you use it.I'm not talking thousands of uses- I've only had it about two weeks and probably only use the stamp 5x a day."
1,Defective battery,"Windows showed the battery charged 89%, but disconnection of AC shut down the notebook.Checked by HP instruction and after 30 min of battery charging the notebook did not turn on.Very disappointed with this product and by Amazon.com, selling it to loyal customers."
5,What makes conspiracy theorists tick?,"Them takes us on tour of the world's extreme conspiracy theorists, to see what they have in common.As an armchair conspiracy theorist myself (who wishes the REALLY crazy ones would stop ruining the credibility of real conspiracies), I found this a fun look at some really wacky people.The author takes us to David Icke, who believes the world is being run by giant green lizards. We go to the Jewish Anti-Defamation League, who thinks David Icke is anti-semitic (giant lizard is code for Jew). We go to a branch of the KKK who sees itself as the kinder, gentler KKK. We follow the author as (himself Jewish) almost gets killed in an Aryan camp. We follow him as he sneaks into the world-dominating Builderberg Groups secret camp and video tapes a ritual.This book neither contributed nor detracted from my belief that conspiracies may exist. It did give me a better understanding of conspiracy theories and the kooks behind them. It was also very fun to read."
3,Sarcasm clothed as humor,"Except for the parts on Ruby Ridge, I found this book highly disappointing. The author's personal bias just doesn't creep in, but charges in like a bull in a china shop. Ronson has presented a very biased anecdotal case, using carefully-selected characters and carefully-disguised sarcasm sprinkled throughout the book. The only part worth reading was the part on Ruby Ridge.If you agree with Ronson's apparent mission to dismiss conspiracy theorists as crazies without presenting any substantial evidence, he has succeeded. But if you want an objective look at the Bilderberg Group, then this is the wrong book."
1,Is this for real??,"As one who has done a lot of research on extremists and has met and investigated many of them, I find this a very shallow book. I can't believe he had not heard of the Bilderbergers before he started the book. It just fell flat with me. I find it hard to believe."
1,Ignorance is Bliss,"Jon Ronson makes an attempt to get you ""sympethetic"" about so-called extremists, that they're just trapped in their own minds, when he really has no evidence that they're wrong in their theories. He tries to get us to see the ridiculosness of David Ickes lizard theory when in reality, David Icke has the most comprehensive and on the mark evidence of the world leader's to date. Jon Ronson like's to make himself look good and make himself look like the most intelligent in each situation, when he really is the ignorant one."
1,"Stupid, stupid stupid!","Too much garbage clouds the facts, if there are any. Obviously a very amateur writer who calls himself a journalist. An 'Imternational Bestseller?' I don't thimk so!"
2,"I didn't appreciate the study of group paranoia, although its there","I didn't appreciate the study of group paranoia, although it's there. The government gives ample cause for individuals to feel they have to bear arms to protect themselves."
3,"Interesting, but could be more","""Them"" is pretty well written, and moves at a good pace, but too often just skims along the surface of the interesting groups that the author discovers.I give Ronson a lot of credit for his work -- spending time seeking out, then ""shadowing"" these groups is no easy effort. He's obviously a personable and persuasive guy in order to accomplish these objectives.But this book feels like a series of magazine articles stitched together. Not enough depth, too much ""I wonder if they trust me, the jew, the journalist, the white guy"". He either didn't have as much access as he'd like us to believe, and is thus reduced to platitudes, or he's holding back on the ""in depth"" material for another volume.All in all, a good read. But like fast food, you don't come away totally pleased and full. If you'd looking for the perspective of a social scientist, don't bother. But if you like the 20/20 and Dateline NBC style of coverage you'll love ""Them""."
3,... the author is really smart,"...All examples show how dumb the extremists are and how witty the author is. This book was interesting enough to finish reading, but not good enough for me to recommend to others. It does have some interesting insights, but considering they are quite one-sided, their validity is hard to believe in. Its definitely not as funny as I hoped it would be."
3,Overhyped and Oversold,"After I read the book, I re-read the cover and was surprised at how overstated it seemed. Maybe that's part of the joke on the reader.Much of the book can be found on YouTube... word for word if you search for David Icke and Jon Ronson. If you want to read the transcripts of the video, and more like it, then this book is for you!"
1,Faux naif not always good idea,"It is interesting that Jon Ronson comes out on top in all of these encounters. This is the problem with the faux naif style. The book is full of episodes where Ronson says things lilke: 'But Omar, I thought we were becoming friends?' Why is it necessary that he become friends with these people? It begs the question of does he like them really in the first place? I think he was being a little dishonest about his motives in this book. He claims to be genuinely interested in understanding their point of view but ends up giving them enough rope to hang themselves. This is what he does in all his work."
5,Essential Petty album,"It's hard to believe this album was released in 1994! It doesn't sound dated whatsoever. If anything Rick Rubin's spare production of this album gives it an almost timeless quality. This album could've been released last week. As for songs? They're all fantastic. From classic rock, acoustic folk, and beautiful Rickenbacker jangle pop - it's all here. Lyrically, this is one of TP's most reflective album's ever. I always felt the overall mood of the album's theme was 'make the most of this life' and 'don't be afraid to move on when you know you must move on'. It's a great feel good album, and if you're a Petty fan or new to his music this is the one to get. You'll love it."
5,Nothing better,"This album takes me away from my life and puts me in a place where I can just be. One of his best, Wildflowers contains the core of relationship emotion and carries the listener from the brink of self satisfaction to the dangerous precipice of relationship death and back again to solid ground. The swirling emotional lyrics are pure Petty at his finest.I cannot explain the intense physical and emotional reaction I have to most of the songs on this album, but it makes me want more. Wildflowers moves me. ... It just moves me."
5,How about a NEW RELEASE of this album,"I read that tom petty said he left off some song's for this album ( California, Hope you never, Hung-up and overdue etc. ). Why not add them to this album and any other's left -off......AS A SPECIAL RELEASE. A collectors album for the fans. Heck, we know some of those song's are on ""SHE'S THE ONE"" cd, but they where for this album in the first place.........AND WOULD SOUND BETTER WITH "" WILDFLOWERS "" cd. It's worth a try by the record label. Tom petty needs more collectors albums any-way."
4,Comeback Album,"Tom Petty really used this album as a comeback album and was well received, as it should have been. Filled with classic Petty tracks, this album delievers with every song. Released near Petty's Greatest Hits CD, this was part of a streak in which Petty found great success in the mid-90s with these two albums and the ""She's The One"" Soundtrack. An excellent CD and must own for any fan of great rock music."
4,"Like 83 others have said, his best album.","""Full Moon Fever"" may have been more popular, but I think this is at least as good. Actually this has a few hits of it's own. ""It's Good To Be King"" and ""You Don't Know How It Feels"" were both singles. Other strong songs are ""You Wreck Me"", ""Cabin Down Below"", ""A Higher Place"", and the title song. In fact, every track here is very good, or excellent. ""Wildflowers"" is even more essential to own when you consider that neither of the ""Greatest Hits"" collections include any of these songs (different label). I'd say if the casual fan gets one album after a ""Hits"" disc, it's got to be this one. I might even get this first it's so good."
5,Tom Petty rocks,This is an album that takes me back to some good times back in high school. I don't know why I didn't get this sooner.
5,Late Bloomer,"I've been a big Tom Petty fan since the very first album. The first 3 albums by Petty and the Heartbreakers still stand as one of the greatest, most breathtaking musical trilogies in the rock era. Really, they are that wonderful. But I somehow got ""away"" from Petty in the 90s, no doubt stuck in some sort of ""alternative rock"" phase, and so I missed out on ""Wallflowers"" the first time around. Finally bought a copy last month and I'm hooked. Great songs, that Petty twang, and another ace band. Not much to quibble with here; this is just great, classic, American rock."
3,"A good, but not great, CD","I do like this CD, it's just that the second half of it has a lot of mediocre songs. TP and his chromies put out good music, but I think that putting this a 5 stars is inflating. 4.5 Stars: To Find a Friend."
5,An excellent addition to any CD collection.,"I can't remember the first time I heard Tom Petty's 'Wildflowers'. I can't remember if I even liked it..(Considering I was but a lad at the time..) What with hard hitting bands like The Deftones, The Offspring, and Korn achieving their peak of popularity during my high school years; one would not consider 'Wildflowers' to be amongst my favorite albums. But this impressive mix of music and emotion was always able to creep into my top 10.Tom Petty is definately at his finest in this collection of tunes, which I believe to be one of his most overlooked and underrated albums.A high recommendation from me."
5,WILDFLOWERS CD,I love this CD. I had it but it got all scratched and skipped so i just had to get another one to replace it.
4,Geoffrey Himes is a moron...,"I'll bet Goeffrey Himes, the Amazon reviewer of this album, doesn't even know how to play a guitar, much less know anything about real music. I didn't know if I should get angry or just laugh at this poor sucker. This album rocks! One of my favorite Tom Petty albums. Buy it. You'll love it. And never mind what little ""Goeffrey"" has to say."
5,Mr. Petty in full swing,"Okay, yeah, there are great artists with great songs out there. This though, is a great artist with a great album. Like U2's ""Joshua Tree"" or, even more appropriate, ""Actung Baby"", ""Wildflowers"" is pure greatness from the first note to the last. I bought this album knowing Tom Petty was doing some different things. Nothing too different, but different. This album is a mature and insightful Tom Petty that has been longing. His early work is remakable, this is stupendous. Each and every song has it's own feeling, but not one too far from the other. It's almost like every song deserves it's own spin-off album. This is the start of the Tom Petty that is still incredible today and has not stopped. Start here and keep going. ""Echo"" is a great place to end. But then there will be more greatness. Seriously, get in the car, drive on a great stretch of road and let yourself get lost in ""Wildflowers"". It's perfect."
4,One of the better Tom Petty albums! Great Music!,"Classic Tom Petty sound. It's not quite the pinnacle of Tom Petty like Full Moon Fever or Highway Companion, but it's close."
5,One of his best,What makes this album great from the start is that they didn't use any synthesizers and each song plays exactly how it was recorded. The band literally sat down in the studio and played each song. The result is a more natural and full sound.The song writing is great and it covers a wide range of styles. Wildflowers sounds a lot like a Tom Petty album from the 70's.
4,Looking into yourself for answers,"Reginald Davis provides us with his results of a 20 year study on one persons search for truth, knowledge and understanding. He shares his opinions and the opinions of many including Carl Jung, Plato, The Bible and more to express his ideas on values and beliefs. Intersting read that will open your mind to other views on how people beleive in themselves and how they live."
5,The debut of a contemporary jazz master,"With ""Trust"" the world was introduced to the best contemporary jazz saxophonist of our time. There is no beginners jitters here, only solid, smooth and sexy sax playing. Boney perfected his talent by playing with the likes of The Isley Brothers, Teena Marie, Vesta, Cherrelle and Ray Parker Jr. and all that talent comes through on every track here. My favorite is the song dedicated to his wife, ""Lily"". The emotion for his wife is brilliantly projected through his sax and would make any woman melt. The rest of the album defines what Smooth Jazz is all about. No collection would be complete without ""Trust""."
5,Soulfully sumptuous,I've been waiting to collect all of Boney's soulful sax compilations. This is one of my favorites. Boney can keep telling 'his story' via his melodic mood setting music. Boney rocks the sexy(saxy)soul sound.
4,Trust,This is just great listening. Wonderful artistry by great sax! This album needs a little more variety! I loved it!
3,Trust,"I prefer Body Lanquage, Seduction, and Send One Your Love. They are so soft and smooth. I'm 66 & retired & I like the soft & smooth things in life."
3,Russia in Search of Itself,"A book that seems too small to contain the material that it covers. The reader is left with the feeling that Billington started with at least 10,000 pages of good material and was forced to squeeze a Reader's Digest version of it into 234 pages. This results in a rather choppy text that seems to bubble over with non sequitors. If you like puzzles and opportunities to pursue loose ends thru other books and resources, this might be a really neat book to read. If you cherish a smooth read, you will not be happy until the last two chapters. In fact, the last chapter (Conclusion) is quite good and might be worth the price of the book all by itself. Billington makes some interesting and potentially useful points about Russia and the Russian psyche in the conclusion."
2,Too dry and academic,For the most part this is a tedious scholarly work. While it is only 160 pages it reads like 400. The most interesting part is the discussion about the European/Asian schitzophrenia of Russia. Would probably be better if I went into it thinking of it as an academic book rather than something that would be a fun read.
4,Kistemaker's Work on 1st Corinthians Good,"Kistemaker assumed the responsibility of finishing the NEW TESTAMENT COMMENTARY series after the death of William Hendriksen. The author continues the Reformed emphasis in the series. Kistemaker gives an adequate introduction to the epistle, followed by an outline which he faithfully follows throughout. Most sections conclude with a discussion of ""Greek Words, Phrases, and Constructions"" (Greek font is used). Kistemaker continues the tradition of Hendriksen by including a summary of each chapter of 1 Corinthians at the end of the comments on each chapter in the epistle. The scripture text used in the commentary is Kistemaker's own translation. I recommend it as good volume for the pastor and scholar to purchase for their own personal library."
3,Beeswax,"Quite pricey, imho. However, it is a nice product. Just not something I care to spend this much money on."
4,First of its Kind for Wide-Body Airbus Aircraft,"I've read Mr. Shaw's books now for many years, and he rarely puts out a stinker. This is actually published by Osprey Aviation and is part of their Civil Aircraft Series.Quality of the book, writing and photos is very high. Each chapter covers a different Airbus widebody and begins with text desribing the design and customers that bought it.The book is full of high quality photos of aircraft during production and flying the line. If you're interested in airliners in general, or Airbus widebodies specifically, this one is for you!"
3,The Old Philosopher,"I used to LOVE this guy on the old Steve Allen show and would LOVE to find some of his other material...you know the general stuff like - ""My wife went out for a corned beef sandwich a week ago. the sandwich came back but she didnt.Is that whats bothering you, bunkie?""....""keep your head up and never give up that ship"" kind of routine rather than the one on musicians. Anyone have any of this older stuff?"
5,Old Jazzy,I first heard Eddies The Old Philopher routine on a Dr Demento album and I was on the floor laughing. He is pretty funny. I have since gotten Christmas Party with Eddie G for among other things his Christmas version of that same sketch and this. So I have a small bone to pick with that reviewer who wants and likes only his old stuff. Who cares if he updates this routine? This album is excellent too and I give it five stars. He does seven of his old philopher routines four of which are on music. Theres The Jazzy Old Philopher Cool Philopher Longhair Philopher and The Very Jazzy Old Philopher.Thers also one about acting Showbiz Philopher one about spending money Inflated philopher and one about going on vacation Tourist Philopher. Theres also three about people you want to stay away from if you want to stay sane. Stay Away Stay WayAway and Stay Far Away. Theres also two intromentals and a eight minute sketch about a play called Little Ciggerette Girl. like I said Id give it five stars.
1,"Johnny Edsall, I HATE this CD.","No offense Johnny, but I and everyone else at work HATES this cd. The only exception of course would be Bob Ryan. He says he can't get enough of him and he wants you to play it more often. Never give up, never give up!"
4,nice lights,hope durability is not an issue as gravel and rocks could likely hit housing on country travel roadsvery bright easy to mountseems to be a good value
3,backup lights,"They dont light up as well as I expected for 50 watts, but easily twice as brite as my stock lights. One has some moisture in it already that came in through the heat escape vent. Hoping it dries out"
4,Kept Me Laughing!,"I highly recommend this film. I especially loved the relationship between the lead and his agent. I watched it with my three best friends, who just happen to be gay, and...as their ""hag"", I can say we laughed all the way through it. It's funny, tender AND it makes you wonder...what would it be like to have to live an untrue life? To have to hurt someone to conform to other people's sense of normal? This movie will make you laugh and, hopefully,....think."
2,PABULUM FARE,"THIS IS A GOSSAMER-VEILED STORY, SEEMINGLY BASED ON THE LIFEOF ROCK HUDSON. INSIPID, SIMPLISTIC, AND ROSILY-COLORED. NEITHER A COMEDY NOR A DRAMA, VIEWING WAS A WASTE OF TIME. RUN LIKE HELL- THIS IS A TURKEY!"
2,Thinly veiled Rock Hudson story served up as farce,"Straight-Jacket would have us believe that it is a clever wink wink at Hollywood in the 1950's, delivered as a ficticious tale about the very real Hollywood closet life homosexuals lived. Maybe...but only a bit.The acting is good enough. And Veronica Cartright is always fun to watch, especially here as she chews up the scenery. But it's still not enough to save this film from itself.The plot of the film roughly follows the life of Rock Hudson. He was known to be gay by the ""in the know"" people in Hollywood, but when fear of it getting out was on the horizon, the studio married him off to a secretary.I don't know what the point of the film really is, but as an innocent farce, it's fine, but it's not much deeper than that."
2,Not as much fun as I'd hoped for,"""Straight Jacket"" is an adaptation of a stage play but unfortunately too much of it has been left stagebound. The overacting, exaggerated gestures, cutesy dialogue may work on stage but it all seems rather clunky and forced as a movie. The writers and director should have streamlined it a bit more for film. One of the worst, cringe-inducing parts comes early when the main character hops around chanting, ""I'm gonna be Ben Hur...""; talk about awkwardly placed. The entire movie suffers from similar supposed-to-be-funny-but-not-really antics.There are two stand-outs in the cast: Jack Plotnick is as funny as ever, and I enjoy seeing Veronica Cartwright in anything.Not as much fun as ""Girls will be Girls."""
1,I have not recieved this item,"I never recieved this item, which was supposed to arrive on August 31st (it is now October 9th.) And I have not recieved a refund. I have tried to contact the seller and they have not responded."
3,Its a Calculus book.,"The book was Dirt cheap, but other than that, you have to remember that it's full of calculus: the most evil of all maths. I'd have to say that unless you're really mathematically minded, you may not fully understand topics in the book just by trying to read/learn them. Some concepts that are complicated are broken down into other complicated terms that I found weren't simple enough for someone to read them and have his/her memory refreshed from class. If my instructor teaches me something, and i go to study, and the book is difficult to decipher, then it leaves my recollection of my lecture fuzzy."
2,Calculus: Early Transcendental Functions,This book tries so hard to teach the material that it fails. It is not helpful and does not explain concepts very well.
4,Good quality,"The book is in great shape but shipping took a little bit longer than expected. Overall very happy with what I got for the price I got it at. Luckily my class is demoing a new book free of charge, or I would have been out of a book for the first two weeks of class."
2,Without phonemic transcription,"Students need to know how to pronounce English words, this dictionary doesn't have phonemic transcription. You have no information about pronunciation."
5,GREAT School dictonary at the right price,"This is a perfect dictionary for the student just getting into the language. I bought it for my 4th, 6th and 8th graders, and each of them found them easy to use and useful in both the classroom as well as for homework. Don't let the price fool you, you geat alot of value in this book. Buy one for the house and one for school."
3,They'll do,"I got these dictionaries for my students in Bolivia and while they did serve their purpose for the price, the only thing I wish it had were phonetic pronunciations. This I felt was the only thing missing. Otherwise, it was a good dictionary for my students in beginners English."
2,Space Requirements around USB port,Don't get this if you don't have an inch 3/4 in clearance on both sides of the USB port and at least 1/4 in clearance top to bottom you are planning to use it in. It won't fit when your UBS ports are stacked horizontally or vertically and you already have other devices plugged in. I had to use a UBS extension cable just to plug mine in.
3,This adapter did not last long before it broke.,"My son bought this adapter for me about 3 months ago and it broke about 2 weeks ago. It just stop working and the light did not come on. I mailed it back to Belkin In Compton, CA and as of today (03-16-09) I am waiting for the replacement. It has a lifetime gaurantee so no money was exchanged. I just had to pay for postage to send it back. In the mean time I cannot use my laptop to get on the internet. I have to use the desktop. But it did work well while it was working."
4,Good Adapter for the Price,"It works well. The only problems I had is that occasionally it loses it's connection. Out of no where, too. Suddenly a message will appear from the taskbar that says it is trying to regain the connection. It doesn't take long to do, but it does it often.It is versatile too. I have it installed on two different computers, since they aren't networked, i can simply unplug the adapter from one, move it to the other and within a minute or so I have a connection. But it, too, loses the connection.Overall, if you need an adapter, fast, or if your just tight on money, this adapter will do."
4,"adorable watch, no instructions",Would have been a perfect transaction if instruction booklet came with watch.
2,Disppointed by Sony,"I bought this Sony Notebook on Amazon.com after lot of online study of different makes and models. The specifications for Sony VGN-SZ430 N/B appeared great on paper / online. Amazon delivered it on time. But I am totally disappointed by ony after using it for about a month. Following are main drawbacks:1. The laptop becomes hot very quickly and you can not keep it in your lap for long.2. It is very slow though it boasts a Dual Core 2 Intel processor T7200. I think it is due to lots of pre-installed programs on trial basis (for 60 days)3. The Windows Vista Business, pre-installed on the laptop crashes often. I would say it is an unstable operating system.4. The battery life is just about 1.5 hours.5. The built-in-camera picture quality is poor.6. The cooling fan is very noisy. I have owned other laptops with practicaly no noise.7. The customer support is poor. It takes about 40 minutes of waiting to reach a level 2 support"
1,"Noisy, Noisy and Noisy!","This laptop could be #1. However, its fan is very noisy. I don't know if new versions have the same problem but don't ever think about this one unless you don't want to work with a noisy laptop."
1,Useless product,"I dont know how the above reviewers had such a 'nice' experience with this 'Fantastic' product. First of all, when I ordered it for the first time from IGGFactory, it never mentioned that silver color is out of stock and later advised me to take a Black colored one rather than the silver which I had ordered. Then when I cancelled my order and placed a new order few days later, for a silver one, I received a faulty product. It transmits for 1.5 to 2 minutes and then stops transmitting. You again have to press M button to make it start transmitting again. I would love to hear from others how they rated is as an excellent product. If you move it a little away from the radio, you can hear lot of static and disturbance. And this transmitter sucks battery real quick.....how can it be a good product"
1,"""complete""-ly misleading","An exhaustive, definitive Beastie Boys documentary this is not. The title is intentionally misleading. What you get instead in the package are 2 items:1) ""Horseplay"", a 2004 documentary DVD about 63 minutes long featuring interviews with DJ Hurricane, a Spin magazine editor, some members of the proto-Beastie Boys hardcore bands, and a few others. Absolutely no Beastie Boys interviews or music on this one. A lot of panning and zooming in and out on stock photography though.2) A 1999 audio CD called ""Maximum Beastie Boys"". You can get this used for $2 on amazon.Yes, I feel a little ripped off."
5,Throw Away your Plastic!,"I will never buy plastic again...this primarily rectangular set is perfect! I store everything from cookies, to leftovers in these containers...and can rest assured that we will be safely microwave re-heating in glass, not plastic. The rectangular shape is great in the frige...no wasted space. I bought 3 sets and it is perfect for my family of 9."
3,needs better design,"Purchased this for my husband because he needs a pump for his weekly guys pick-up basketball games and for our bicycles. The storage compartment doesn't hold everything once it's unraveled so that is annoying. Also, one of the plastic pieces wasn't designed well and snapped off inside the basketball and there wasn't a way to re-attach it. I don't know much about it, but my husband has been frustrated with it."
4,Great asset!,"A friend had one of these and I liked it so much, I had to have one. It is compact & easy to use and I leave it in the trunk of my car, so it is always available. We ride our bikes a lot and this makes life so much easier!"
3,SLOW!,This is one SLOW pump. But it does work. You just have to be VERY patient. You get what you paid for.
2,Not Terribly Realistic,"I would give the pictures in this book five stars but the text is very unrealistic. I've found that the working mothers I know just don't have a lot of time to spend with their children after working all day, coming home and cooking and cleaning and doing the things that need to be done.Plus it perpetuates the myth of ""quality"" time which I think is a very dangerous concept."
5,When Mama Comes Home,We have been using this book in our Child Development Center for years. I love this book and bought one for my 6 month old Granddaughter (who is red headed like her mom) that lives in Haiti. (Missionaries)The illustrations are as pretty as the writing.
4,I can relate to the message in this story.,When Mamma Comes Home Tonight was the first book I bought my infant daughter for Christmas. The book focuses on the activities that mom and baby will enjoy now that the work day is over. The total focus is on the baby and enjoying that wonderful time. The illustrations are very well done and will be enjoyed for years. The story is simple and straightforward. I highly recommend it for us working moms who work hard through the day and delight in their time with baby.
3,Mis guessed it.,"Nice book. It was a bit late on the age of the child in mind. I still have it, did not give as gift. I love the sayings."
3,Received,"The book arrived in a timely fashion and was very inexpensive. I do not like the book as well as I hoped I would, due to what I consider to be a cheesy and outdated content, however Amazon did a great job getting it to me."
5,Love this book,This is a very sweet story for young children of working mothers. My son loved to hear it being read to him.
3,Warning! Repackage of The Complete Season One!,Please be aware that this set is the first and second disks of The Universe: The Complete Season One. Disc 3 of The Complete Season One (not included in this set) also contains one episode on the outer planets.
4,OK but very small,Item arrived exactly as described. I am very pleased with this purchase; item perfect for intended use. Really nice buy!
4,good for self-evaluation,"Given today's business climate and the ongoing recession, this is a good book to read. The book is hardly groundbreaking, but it does reiterate everything we know but were waiting for someone to put on paper. Mainly, the book states that innovators make mistakes, and one's past performance is not an ultimate indicator of how one will do in the future. It is a bit of a pep talk, since it goes into how supposed success is relative and that we need to redefine what success means, but there is nothing wrong with that. The book is also a cautionary tale for big companies that may insist on doing the same things because it was successful in the past, but I doubt that anyone in large companies would heed these lessons, since they are typically full of ""sheeple"" who just want to stay under the radar and survive."
3,OK,"This is an interesting book, but it's not really incisive nor deep. It's quite bland, but with some worthy commentary and examples throughout."
1,Vi vse mozheti sasaty moy bal-shoy hui!!,vi vse russkiyi suki....... kotseluyti mayu belayoo jopu. peees out neeega!!!
4,Good Read,I thought the book was a great way to think of different approaches to common work situations. Anything that sparks creativity and conversation is always a good thing in my book!
4,The Law album,"I love Paul Rogers voice from his Bad Company days. I recently heard a track from this album on the radio, instantly recognizing Paul as the singer. Found the album immediately on Amazon and downloaded. Great!"
1,Glowsticks,Yeah if only picture were reality. Nice try but these glowsticks are good for about everything except glowing. Keep your money and find better glowsticks. Don't waste time or money on these.
2,Would not purchase again.,"The necklaces arrived with defective connectors. The Green Group responded to my email complaint and did send new connectors immediately. So glad I opened the necklaces before our event! But, the necklaces weren't very bright at all and we ended up throwing most of the pink ones away because they didn't glow. Very disappointed in this product."
1,Just plain junk,"Not sure if these were ever a good product, but this seller obviously has no problem selling old junk that is worthless. Not only did the majority and I mean major majority, barely even glow, the ones that actually did glow(green and blue) lasted a couple minutes.These people should be ashamed because they know that the odds are this purchase would be for children to enjoy, and they don't hesitate to cruelly disappoint them.Trust me, stay away from these guys."
1,AWFUL - Straight to the trash,"Don't buy these. NO FUN for the kids.. They will be and thus you will be VERY disappointed. 8 out of 50 worked and of those 8, they hardly glowed! It took about two minutes for them to even start a hint of illumination. AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thank god I bought finger flashlights too..Now those are a hit!"
4,Excellent older music,"He is obviously one of the best of his time and puts to shame some of the newer singers. You get alot for your money on this CD too. I highly recommend it for a Sunday morning to enjoy your coffee, newspaper, and scones :}"
3,Redcoats - 'Meet The Redcoats:Finally' (Bacchus Archives),"The Redcoats were a short-lived band made up of three musicians that cut a collection of twelve tracks that apparently never got to see the light of day,for these songs were recording in 1967.So,some 35 years later,this CD is the first time anyone outside the group ever had the chance to check them out for themselves.Actually,'Meet The Redcoats' isn't bad at all.A couple of the tunes I enjoyed hearing was the could've been a hit(in my opinion)""You Had No Right"",""When Tomorrow Comes"",the Merseybeat-ish ""Back To His Door"" and ""Baby Don't Go"".Notice the band has had one major influence,THE BEATLES!Hey,these guys are alright.Should appeal to fans of the Fab Four,Dave Clark Five,Searchers and the Easybeats.Some decent music that you've never heard."
3,Good to see on CD!,"This release has its ups & downs. First, it includes rare & unreleased material of this GREAT group, thumbs up for someone even attempting to release this.The thumbs down is that even though much of the material is off vinyl, it is poorly restored with a poor EQ job & audible clicks & pops in it.The liner notes fail to mention who the band later became, in which they recorded a full LP for RCA as ""The Sidekicks"". Though this compilation puts it down, I think their Sidekicks material is great, and that is why I bought THIS CD. I honestly think The Sidekicks LP is stronger material, though a few standout tracks here are definitely worth putting this CD in your collection.Overall, good release, good group - better sound restoration would have made it a more desirable product."
3,goes too fast,"teach yourself dutchGrammar and readings are exhaustive, you will get a comprehensive knowledge of the language. However in order to build on a basic vocabulary you will need to practice with some other manuals. Drills and exercises are few and to learn a language you need repetition."
4,not too bad,I got this a couple weeks ago and I'm finding it's a rather good into. to dutch. It's easy to follow and I'm sure anyone will quickly understand the short conversations.
1,Onmogelijk! This has *got* to be a practical joke.,"Having grown up and matriculated through elementary and high schools as well as college in The Netherlands, I know what a difficult language it is. It has oftentimes been compared that, for a non-Dutch speaking person, it is akin to learn Mandarin.Not quite impossible, but very, very difficult.A book and CD set cannot possibly cover all of that for the Dutch language, and the dearth of sets like these for Mandarin proves my point."
1,not really a good starter book,if you don't know a thing about the dutch language this is certainly not a good starter book. I've read better books and better explaination. being dutch myself I know what I'm talking about.
3,it was ok but not great,"I found 'teach yourself Dutch' to be very difficult. This is not for beginners. I was hoping to spend more time on pronuciation. It was too fast and went too soon into conversation. Also, there were sectons in the book that the narrater skipted. The book seemed to be a good study guide but it was hard to tell because of the speed and parts skipted on the CD's"
2,I agree with Daryl Buitenlander...,"For a person beginning to learn dutch, I found this book to be extremly frustrating at times. Ive learned a forgien language before and I know this is not the way to learn a language. Learning a language is not about memorizing phrases and then repeating them by hearing them by some silly dialogue. The excercises seemed like the authors were really lazy and wanted you to make up your own excercises instead of practicing sentence syntax and structure. I would suggest the colloquail series too. (although ive only done the second series so far..and not thefirst) I did this series twice (because i didnt really know where to go to find an inexpensive dutch beginners book) and i cant say it vastly improved my dutch skills. If youre looking for a book to help you speak conversationally on a trip to the netherlands, this might be a book for you. If youre serious about actually learning dutch, get something with more substance!"
5,a unique practical book causing ministers every to- THINK!,"Brian gives us a book that actually tackles the postmodern subject without losing the reader with philosophical jargon. I found that his approach is so practical because he is living it out. He writes out of experience and gives us a framework to enter this bold new world with a sense of optimism rather than fear, excitement rather than dread.His writings on leadership and missions are a must read for every church practitioner."
5,Understanding the needs of the neXt generation,"This book is a ""must read"" for every church leader and Bible College student. If you are struggling with how to understand and communicate with those steeped in Postmodern thought this book has many answers. Its not just another mega-church ""how to"" book. Reinventing Your Church goes much farther. This book is a refreshing and practical look at what it will take to communicate Jesus to the world in the next generation. The chapter on missions is especially insightful."
5,Will challenge you to rethink the church from scratch.,"Provides the real challenges for real change in today's culture and our love for past formula's, our disdain for a world we disagree with.This book is not filled with a statistics that tells the church what it already knows - ""things are bad and the church is losing effectiveness.""McLaren digs into our thinking habits and compares that to the culture around us. He provides a bridge that helps us maintain our spiritual integrity but reaches out to a world that has fully embrassed the postmodern philosophy."
4,Best reference on seed starting,"This is a great reference book for gardeners who are interested in starting plants from seed rather than buying the same old stuff from their local garden centers each year. This best thing about this book is that it rates each plant on its degree of difficulty when it comes to growing that plant from seed. Unlike the seed catalogs which imply that all plants are easy to grow from seed, this book breaks it down into detailed instructions as to how to get the seeds to germinate and what conditions they require once germination takes place. It is a great reference when browsing through the seed catalogs as to which plants are worth trying to start from seed and those whose needs may be way too much time, money or environmentally demanding to even bother with."
3,Not what is pictured or described,"While the device pictured is the larger volume system (5 gal vs 1400 ml), the tubing included and the tubing described in the instructions for the 1400 ml set-up are not the same. The critical difference in the included tubing and the instructions has to do with the drip counter and adapter. The drip counter and adapter is not included in the included tubing even though the instructions show it."
1,Garage product,Do not buy this line it is garage. The size is off about two sizes too small. I wanted to return but I was stationed overseas and I didn't have the time so I gave it away when I returned home. The material is not great ...its just not a good product don't waste your money on it.
1,shouldn't cost more than $10,"Garbage , I didn't want to go out and buy another brand name like Nike or Adidas so I bought these, what a waste of money."
1,An embarrassment for Reformed theology.,Even a pre-University chap could debunk that book. It is right in what it defends but wrong in the way it does it. Flawed methodolgy is Frame's Aquiles heel.
5,Well worth the wait!,"The Doctrine of God may very well be the best book ever written on the doctrine of God. John Frame expounds God's covenant lordship in a way that causes one to worship God in spirit and truth. His biblically-grounded methodology yields many fresh insights into the control, authority, and presence of our covenant Lord in the context of his acts, descriptions, and Trinitiarian presence. I highly commend this deeply profound and persuasive book. I am confident that it will be worth the investment of time, money, and labor to digest its contents.--Justin TaylorDirector of Theological Resources & EducationDesiring God Ministries"
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"I found this book to be incredible. I sincerely appreciated Frame's balanced and kind-hearted approach to theology. He handled issues that have many people up in arms with love and respect. I have yet to see such a readable, comprehensive, and profound book that so easily defends the Reformed faith. I particularly enjoyed the portion on the immutability of God. Frame handles this masterfully! This section alone is worth the price of the book. John Frame is to be commended for his achievment in this book. I am anxiously anticipating the future books in this series. This book needs to be in every serious believer's library."
5,Moravec's Romantic Vision Of Mozart,"Without a doubt, Moravec is one of our finest pianists. Having heard him play a great recital program last year at Carnegie Hall which featured music by Debussy, Mozart and Janacek, I was eagerly looking forward to hearing this CD. Moravec gives a vibrant, Romantic interpretation of Mozart's 20th piano concerto that is the most stirring I've heard; it's certainly a far cry from Brendel's austere approach. As for the 23rd Piano Concerto, Moravec's playing conveys more of a Classical interpretation than Romantic, but it is still marked by much vibrant warmth. I don't have to emphasize Sir Neville Marriner's excellence as a fine interpreter of Mozart; both he and the Academy are in splendid form as accompanists. Hopefully this is part of an ongoing Mozart piano concerto cycle which Moravec will complete. The sound quality is splendid."
3,The old concelebration booklet,"This, in its time' was a user friendly booklet. It has been replaced by the new Roman Missel so I don't think this review would be of use to anyone"
4,Nice to read,"This is a great book for kids: boys and girls alike.Very creatively illustrated and a nice story to read, Lauren Child does an amazing job with this children's book.In this volume, you'll get to know who is Clarice Bean and her family (which is presented in a most imaginative way). I still have to read the other Clarice Bean books, but this one I don't regret I bought it."
5,Christmas Tradition for Baking,"Each holiday season I purchase Wilton's Snowflake Sprinkle Mix -- it has become a family tradition. When I am particularly hurried the sprinkle adds a festive touch to plain bake goods like cupcakes, sheet cakes and of course, cookies. I like the mix because it is a bit different than the usual plain colored sugars and multi-colored sprinkles yet the design is clear and easy to identify. Other specialty sprinkles are sometimes too complex to create in such a small size and the result is muddled -- what are those little brown things -- gingerbread men?In past seasons I have included the Snowflake Sprinkle Mix in my Thanksgiving gifts to friends and family who bake to mark the approach of Christmas."
5,The best in the West,"What an excellent perspective, an up closer and personal look at these majestic animals ....a site to behold, a must have for all ages."
5,Christmas Gift,This was a Christmas Gift for my Honey last year. He asked for this item so I am giving it a love it
3,def leppard video's,"It is what it is a collection of video's, if your a def leppard fan you will like it alot, if your a live performace fan like me it is just ok"
4,"Decent collection, Felt it missed a few videos, but still decent. Best US version","I Picked this up when it first came out, and was happy to have the heart of def leppard's videos on DVD. It contains their biggest hits and best videos. I know they couldn't fit every video on the disc, and I have their other two US DVDs of their older VHS tapes that cover some of the older material. This does contain ""No Matter What"" rehersal footage and video, which is cool and available only on this DVD. Saying this, I must say that I did buy the European Def Leppard Best Of DVD, which has 29 videos total on it, plus 3 hidden alternative videos. I paid more for that version, but I felt it was a better one stop shop for def leppard videos. But, I recommend this Rock Of Ages collection for most Leppard fans, it covers the biggest and best, and is more affordable/better value for a casual fan."
3,In Search of Shareholder Value: Managing the drivers of perf,"If you are a beginner in the area, or you want to start a financial analyst job in PWC, this book is the one. The book explains thoroughly everything about whats-on-what of values according to 'finance'. However if you want something more advance, try another book."
5,The Best Book on Shareholder Value Management,"In Search of Shareholder Value: Managing the Drivers of Performance is the PricewaterhouseCoopers book on shareholder value. This is the only shareholder value book which explicitly recognizes the necessity of using industry-specific models and using real option modeling techniques. If you read one book on shareholder value management, this is the book to read."
3,"Maybe, someday, on sale","First of all, let me say that STARGATE is probably my favorite show. I happily own seasons one through six. But, season seven was so incredibly disappointing, so dull, uneven, and relatively uneventful (compared to what the show is usually like), that I cannot imagine myself buying it any time soon, not even for the extras.I have to agree with the gist of Gategrrl's review, and admit that I think of Seven the way Wagner's music has been described: something on the order of ""glorious minutes, and boring half hours."" The only thing I really appreciated was the way the writers finally dumped the ""shippy"" fantasy. Thank the lord. Season Seven will stay on vhs tapes for me, and gather a lot of dust.IF you like it, I'm happy for you, but I feel that no Stargate is better than season seven's Wrightless and RDAless mediocre Stargate,and that is how I think of Seven. Buy Season One through Six and wait for Eight (the jury is still out, but so far, okay)."
1,Struggling to make any sense of the last 5 episodes,"Acting, what little there was is ok, but writing and directing comes up as a zero..... Something has changed, and it's not a good change. Hope next season comes back to life..."
3,Defective Batch,"The DVD collection itself is awesome! However, the first set I received was defective on disk 5. Amazon was more than accomodating and arranged for a replacement. To my dismay, the exact same defect appeared in the second set. I will not put Amazon through the hassle of another exchange, but I urge you to check into the batch or storage practices of the DVDs. The exact same defect on two separate orders is more than coincidence. This experience may effect my returning to Amazon for future purchases."
5,LOVE STARGATE!,"I love the Stargate saga. My only complaint would be the HD video quality on one Samsung tv and buffering on the LG tv. The LG tv quality is great, but buffers ususally two or three times while watching."
2,Didn't really like this episode,"I got this episode because the my dvd was damaged and the Lost City: Part 1 & 2 were not viewable. I wanted to see if I should replace the seventh season of Stargate SG-1. I found out that these two episodes are probably my least favorite of all of the episodes of all of the seasons. I guess there is no reason to replace the set. I was very dissappointed that General Hammond was replaced and I really, really don't like the character Vice President Kinsey. No offence to anyone, but he is a lot like scum."
5,Love the Series,Welcome back Dr. Jackson. I missed him in season 6 and enjoyed when he guest starred on a few of the shows. I laugh frequently at the commentary of Martin Wood and Peter Delouise. I watch the show without the commentary then again with the commentary. The show Amanda Tapping directed is a bit different and kept me attending to the details as the show unfolded.
3,faulty disc,Have gotten two copies of this set and both disc fives had flaws that made most of the disc unreadable for my DVD player. Contacted Sony for replacement.
4,DO NOT BUY THIS SET RIGHT NOW!,"MGM is having major quality control issues...My 5th disc is bad and only plays corrupted, pixelated garbage. I returned this set for another and it had the same issue. An electronics store employee I know said he has seen this a lot lately. Apparently, a bad batch is out there....I'd wait until this has been cleared up to purchase this otherwise great DVD set."
1,"Incredibly stupid, too much doobie ?????","The last two episodes were total losers, I think the writers and director must have been smoking some really good stuff, because none of it made any sense, unless maybe you were stoned out of your mind......"
1,"Yeah, right : Major loser....","This episode is completely ridiculous. Hard to believe the director went with this, must have been PMS.... Stupid..... Don't waste your time on this one....."
4,its a great dvd!!!,the good stuffi was recived very qiuckits an amazing dvdgood pricebad thingsit's the secound dvd there is somthing wrong with the dvd packwhat i mean is that whene u open it the thing that hold the dvd inside is broken...so the dvd falls to the floor.
3,presentatiom good- disk bad,"i now own all 7 of the stargate shows. 5 disks each. i like em, however the last purchase had a flaw in the disk (#5). i returned it and was promptly supplied with a free replacement. thank you. it has the same flaw. i will be returning it shortly."
3,"Rating the quality of the production, not the show","I'm a huge huge stargate fan so i'm not going to review the show here. but the quality of the DVD's. The packaging and disks seemed like something that you would buy from a high class pirate. Perhaps something from new york with printed labels to go on the DVD's. I suspect that is why so many people had disk issues. (Cheap quality DVD's)However the quality of the audio/video is up to par with normal DVD play back, and considering HD was not possible the quality of episodes are as good as they will get. Personally I would recommend ripping them for playback to avoid any sort of disk read issues."
2,Not the best of the series,"Well, the show is creaking along for its 7th season.Bringing back Shanks really seems like a step back.And Anubis as a villain....ugh, I really preferred the more ""human"" Goa'uld villains.Finally - no subtitles? Really, for a modern show?If you like SG-1 and can buy it during one of the frequent sales, give it a shot. Otherwise, pass for now.Poor Dr. Frazier....."
1,Bate and switch!,"I ordered Season 7. I received the box for season 7, but all the disks inside the box were from season 5! I was very disappointed, I expected more from a name like Amazon!"
3,Just wondering if only my Set was missing Lost City Pt 2,"Finally ordered it and popped it in tonight and was SHOCKED that Lost City Part 2 was not included, even after verifying it was part of season 7. Did I get a fluke set? Yes; the glue for the Atlantis promo thing did rip off part of my box...but heck; to not include the season finale on the seasons series. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
3,Worst season yet (except for 8).,"Season 7 is definitely the worst season of the series. I would only recommend this for diehard fans. I am a diehard so I will probably get it. I think there were some good episodes (Birthright, Evolution part 1, Fallout, & Lost City 1 & 2), but not enough. I thought 7 would be the worst of the series, but so far season 8 seems to be proving me wrong. Not one single good show yet. Hopefully they are just making it boring to make Atlantis look good, and it will get better later on in the season."
1,Bad disc 5,"Like a previous reviewer stated, I too had gone through 3 sets of a bad disc #5. Finally they refunded my money and I am without the set. I also noticed they were all missing episode 22 as well. Was this left out on purpose? I will just wait until they get everything fixed before I repurchase this set."
2,Phoned it home .......,"Unfortunately, Season 7 was the worst of all Stargate seasons. Richard Dean Anderson did not wish to participate for the most part, and the episodes that he did show up, he looked bored and phoned his performance home. Don Davis was sent packing, and most of the episodes were characters studies on the team's lives, very little on the off-world action we have come to expect. On balance a very disappointing season. PS... somone must have figured this out because Season 8, which just finished, was stellar!"
3,A Season Lacking,"... it was a very good account of a disappointing Season 7 of Stargate SG-1. I own the DVDs for Seasons 1-6 and, though I'm a big fan of the series, I have no intention of watching Season 7 again. The two or three episodes from S7 I DID enjoy simply do not justify my spending the money on the complete set."
5,season 7 - the best yet,"the return of dr jackson marked the return to more interesting stories. season six was just marking time. seven is the stargate that fans have come to love.the anubis theme allowed for some really interesting shows, and gave the season a sense of continuity, rather than being just a series of random, unrelated episodes. people may criticize the show as being tame but it is some of the best original television on , and thankfully, it's not a ""reality"" series. one of the few things i look forward to watching."
2,DVD Glitches,"Partway through the first episode on the last disc, the DVD freezes. Fastforwarding only reveals distorted sound bytes and occasional partial frame changes. Using scene selections for chapter 5 of this episode has the same result as fastforwarding. And the entire last episode of Season 7 is a mix of distorted sound bytes and partial frame changes. I haven't had a problem with any other discs in this season."
5,One of the series' strongest episodes,"Stargate is a franchise that is mainly given to self-parody and sci-fi action, but this episode made a very nice foray into drama. I really liked how the writers gave the cast a chance to showcase another dimension of their acting skills. The supporting characters were all quite good, and the writing was pretty decent as well. Episodes like this are one of the many reasons that this delightful show ran for ten enjoyable seasons. I'd have liked to see Adam Baldwin appear in a more permanent role in the show, or maybe in Atlantis. All in all, a good war movie-esque story, with complex and multidimensional characters. A must-see for gate travelers."
5,get it!,i highly recommend all the sg-1 episodes!i have them all on disc and am slowly getting them loaded onto my kindle so i can enjoy them all anytime.
5,Love These series,Anyone that like science fiction will like this series. Amazed at how they come up with a new idea each time!
1,Defective,This set contained a completely unreadable disk #1 straight out of the box. Also noted similar rpoblem in other season sets.
2,If you have nothing else to do...,"I wouldn't recommend this video. The plot goes on slowly, and the amount of stuff you'd want to skip over is fairly large. The acting isn't very convincing on most parts, and I felt like falling asleep on some parts."
3,Alexander the what?,If the real life Alexander saw how he was betrayed in this flick he would roll over. Why fim makers insist on having British actors with their heavy accent portray people of a different language and culture is beyond me.
1,Useless,This DVD is only readable by the American DVD reader system which I didn't know before buying it. Since I live in France it was useless to me
2,Alexander the Great,"Richard Burton, hair dyed blond, wandering around in a miniskirt. A movie only Liz Taylor could love. Drags"
4,Great Film,"THE BEST, NATURAL, REAL AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, THE TRUTH, THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT THE LIFE OF ALEXANDER OF MACEDON, WHO MANY PEOPLE CALL: ALEXANDER THE GREAT."
3,Alexander The Great,"Richard Burton(The Robe,An Excellent film way Better than This) makes an impressive yet at times over dramatic(They are the Greeks Though?) performance,the movie is okay. The Battle scenes are not ""Battle Scenes"" as they should be or perhaps Historically Accurate,Alexander while a Great Military Conqueror and Strategist was not so great after all,While we can(according to ""History"" and ""Historians"") Credit the Greeks with Democracy(In Athens at Least)they ultimately failed(Besides Aristotle)and like most civilizations disappeared.The movie is worth watching But I prefer the Biblical Epics of the same Era."
5,"Terriffying more then Blair Witch Project, Simply Marvouis",Excellect movie best i ve seen in my life. It kept me on the edge until the end.
2,"Might be accurate, but almost unwatchable","The fact that I am writing this while I am actually watching the movie should tell you something. The first hour is very boring, and watching Richard Burton in a blonde wig (yeah, Greeks are well know for their lovely blonde hair) is painful. Accurate? Hardly. So we're just starting the second hour which is suppose to have some good fight scenes, but I doubt it. In any case, it's barely worth renting for $1.00 at redbox, much less buying it."
4,Surprised how good this film was. Sharp writing.,"There is an excellent scene in this film: after Philip is assassinated by a young man, who is inspired to kill by Philip's wife, Alexander brutally kills the assassin (a good friend), then they CUT TO Alexander descending a stone stairway, he stops halfway, and tosses the bloody dagger at the feet of his Mother, the Queen. It's very well done.I had honestly never heard of this film until a picked up a dvd copy at my local library. I expected very little, but got a lot more. Burton is terrific as Alexander, but I think the real star is the writing. Nicely done."
3,It's OK,"This movie is so-so. It's not great, it's not bad, it's not awesome, it's not crappy. I didn't really like Richard Burton as Alexander. He over acted some parts too much and some parts not enough. I liked watching the guy who plays Philip much more. He seemed to really get into his character and made him work for the time that he was in the film.The battle scenes are anemic compared to what we're used to today and even for that time I think left a bit to be desired in that realm. The dialogue could be a bit silly in places and odd in some other parts.I would say, and this had it going for it, it's no worse than the modern version of Alexander with Colin Farrell. To me it seems like Stone watched this movie and only updated it instead of revamping it."
5,Fabulous!,The only alternative to Joan Sutherland. An equally gorgeous and fabulous voice. A true diva that puts me to tears. Sensational recital of so many gems.
1,"Mac owners beware! Runs only on Mac OS X Classic, 8.6-9.2","The product description is very misleading. This only runs on Mac OS X Classic, 8.6-9.2. The product itself might be great, but I wouldn't know, because I wasn't able to run it on my Mac OS X system. Very disappointing for my child and myself."
2,Not at all enough,This product runs slow the music and words run about 20 seconds slower then the graphics. Also the amount of activies was just pathetic compared to other product I purchased. Liked reader rabbit about a million times better. Also like starfall.com better and ABC mouse(if you really wanted to put some money down for a good educational tool)
3,"it's ok, but there are better programs","The program is decent, but I would be hard pressed to say it's exceptional. It isn't all that intuitive, especially for a preschooler and might require some parental involvement to navigate. Personally, I think the Reader Rabbit programs are better."
3,didn't work for windows 7,plain and simple I must not have read the system requirements because it worked for a day then gave error messages.
1,will not work with MAC PRO LION,I bought this software for my grandson. Will not work with new MAC PRO operating system LION. Now I am stuck with it because its been opened.You would think newest software would run any of the old stuff. PC with newer operating systems always run software from older windows versions. Sad.
5,Great learning game,This keeps my 4 year old daughter engaged in learning but in a fun way. This is a better idea than letting her sit in front of a tv.
2,marginal,"The program is old, Windows Vista and Windows 7 don't like it. The 3 and 5 year old enjoyed it for a few hours total (over several days). It has some educational value, but I was hoping for more and better. I am perplexed that there aren't better programs for sale for early education (this is one of the best I could find, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)."
5,Holding Knowledge for Ransom,"The five stars is for the theory itself, not the commodity produced out of the theory . As usual, the fine folks at Springer, like other ""academic"" and ""academic journal"" publishers have managed to snare the copyright to an important book and basically hold it for ransom, making it all but unaffordable to the reading public or small libraries, even in Kindle form. Their entire purpose is to set up as many toll gates as they can at every point of access to knowledge. Too bad for von Foerster's very interesting legacy, fallen into the clutches of capitalistic vultures."
4,A very humorous little book that men should read in order to know what women are really thinking.,"Yes, it is true that this book is very funny, and some may even claim this little book insults men. However, if you read it with a tongue firmly in your cheek, you will laugh along with the ladies. For example, who has never heard of the famous quote by the beautiful Mae West. ""It's not the men in my life that count, it's the life in my men."" How about this one from Nan Tucket? ""What's the thinnest book in the world? What men know about womem."" In conclusion, this is a book men and women will enjoy reading because it will make you smile and laugh.Rating: 4 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Never Trust a Politician)."
3,Poor insight and got sidetracked,"It started off great with an excellent history of how Karl Rove got mad from losing, a great motivator, and how he never gave up which is the true lesson from this book. I agree there were potshots at the republicans about what I'd expect from a talk show.The discussion on the 2000 election fiasco was disappointing. The authors prefaced the chapter with stating that karen and karl just stood by during the recount. That's gotta be ... C'mon, his point man on being presidential simply took a vacation? Please. That was a silent admission as to the authors inability to fill-in the gaps.I got Karl's motivations and experiences but after that the book simply dragged-on reporting what I got from glances at the news. Should have made it 50 pages smaller and $... cheaper.I've started reading Bush's Brain, hopefully it will be better."
2,Great product... horrible flavor!,"The lactaid product is wonderful for anyone that is lactose intolerant. The lactase supplement helps greatly. But go with the tablets. I bought a box of the chewables, and they are terrible. I take them now just because I paid for a box and want to get my money's worth. And once I finish this box, I will always go with the tabs. Granted, ther are more convenient in a place without water... but at the same time, when would you be eating without any liquid to take it down with? Stick to the tabs, you'll be happier."
3,Prefer the tablets,"My wife bought these by accident instead of the caplets. Lactaid, as a product, has helped me in a lot of situations. Like most things, there have been some exceptions - I expect that.I found that these chewables do not work as good as the caplets, in my case. However, my biggest complaint is that I cannot stand the flavor and consistency. I don't want an additional flavor added to whatever it is I am about to eat.I will stick to the pills."
1,Defeats the Purpose,"Lactaid Chewable Tablets are heavily sweetened with mannitol, an alcohol sugar that I find problematic. When I told my GI doctor that I don't seem to tolerate mannitol, he said, ""you and the rest of humanity."" For me, at least, mannitol causes the same symptoms as lactose. In addition to the mannitol, these tablets have a strong, artificial vanilla flavor that doesn't go well with foods containing garlic, for example."
3,Need more than one at a time,"This is a lot easier to take than the pills you have to swallow. The taste is not too bad, in fact it tastes like powdered milk, so I guess it compliments what you're about to eat or drink with it. The problem for me is that one is never enough, I always have to take at least 2 or 3 of these for it to be effective, otherwise I'm just wasting it. I guess if you know that going into it and factor in the cost appropriately then it's OK."
2,Tried it,"Since I always drink Lactaid Milk, I thought I would try their TABS. I have been using a different product before, and unfortunately the Lactaid Brand of TABS does not do the job as well as the other brand, so I will not be purchasing these again."
4,"Effective, but...",These pills are effective for me. My lactose intolerance is HIGH! I have never tried the chewable and I never will again. I just don't like the taste. And it requires extra maintenance. Chew chew chew... Pick extra pill out of your teeth with your tongue... Chew some more... Then add the food (and god forbid it's cheese or something)....The taste is almost like vomit when food is mixed it. I'll still with the regular fast act pills next time.
4,Good Product,"I have used this product regularly for several weeks now, and have found that it does provide relief from the symptoms that go along with lactose intolerance. My personal preference is for the tablet, however the taste of this chewable is relatively pleasant."
1,"Not the Lactaid, but the additives","I am very consistent with my diet, actually have always eaten very healthy all my life. I rarely have Dairy products and when I had yogurt Ice cream which contains Milk obviously it finally caught up with me in, along with not having that tolerance. So, after seeing the Doctors and taking many tests, they concluded with Lactose intolerance. Well, when I decided to have dairy again with the Lactaid Pill, at first (hour or two) everything was fine, then I would later in the night and next several days have a worst reaction then the Dairy itself every gave me in the past. So, I figured it was maybe I needed a second pill to compensate, sure enough I went without dairy for weeks, tried something added a 2nd pill per instructions and the worst i ever felt, nautious, stomach cramps, sweating... So, based on research, there have been no known problems with the Lactase itself, but the additives to some people like myself"
1,Price gouging. Shame!!!!!,"I can't believe you are allowing price gouging on your site. The regular price is $15.00. Yes, there is a shortage, and yes, people are desperate and will probably pay, but I won't."
5,Lactaid,"Lactaid tablets in this box are chewable, and I like them much better than the hard rectangular tablets.This allows me to digest milk, ice cream, yogurt, etc."
2,Disappointing,"Considering the high marks this book got I was very disapointed when I received the book. The rhyming is forced and wordy. Although the story line is a cute idea, and picture are pretty it doesnt quite deliver. The tree wants nothing but to be a Christmas tree but has grown too big to be one. He is very sad. The birds and animals get together to decorate him to make him feel better, and let him know how important he is. The simple story line just takes too long to tell with the rhyming text. My kids are 5 and 8 and we have a big collection of Christmas stories. This didnt hold their attention or crack our top ten favorites!"
5,good lesson to learn,I bought this to read to my grandchildren and really like thelesson learned as the story unfolds. Great illustrations also.
4,"Cute story, beautiful pictures",Great story with beautiful pictures. The only downside is that I bought it for my 18 month old and the storyline is a bit complicated for her. Otherwise she love looking at the animals.
3,"Long drawn out story, pretty pictures","I bought this story for my 2 year old, but it is really for older kids. The story is long, and a lot to read through. The pictures are pretty, but my toddler won't sit through the whole story so I abbreviate it when we ""read"" the book. Maybe when she is older, she'll like it more. I was dissapointed that the description didn't mention the age level. Being a board book I thought it would be appropriate for toddlers."
5,WHAT A WONDERFUL STORY!!!!,"This book has become a favorite Christmas tradition for me and my family! The story and the illustrations are beautiful!! Sometimes we even read it in the summer for a ""Christmas in July"" celebration!!! The Monroe's are wonderfully spiritual people and it shows on every page!! An absolute must read!!"
5,Perfect for Christmas!,I bought this for my 2 year old and was a little worried it had too many words for him to sit still through. He was completely captivated and loved the story and images. The story is very sweet and has a fantastic message. I would highly recommend!! The singsong rhyming is a nice touch as well.
5,A beautiful story with a moral!,"This is my favorite christmas story yet. The illustrations are beautiful and even has a great moral which kids can learn from, esp for the holidays."
5,Great Book,"This is the sweetest book, my grandson aged 3 wants to read it all day long. The pictures are so precious and sweet also. It is hard to find a book with such a message as this one as well. Thanks, Granny"
5,A Wish to be A Christmas Tree,Such a sweet story and beautiful pictures! My Pre K class loved this book so much they asked me to read it a second time in the same day!
4,This was a very enjoyable read,I grew up in the area where the book was written. I was at the housing area where they had the swimming pool shaped like a space capsule. It brought back a lot of great memories. Anyone who is a space enthusiast will enjoy adding this book to their space library.
5,Terrific! Wonderous! Made me feel like a kid again.,"Bryan Ethier has created a masterpiece. This book brought all of those childhood memories back that I thought I had forever forgotten. It brought me back to a time in America when things seemed so exciting and nothing could stand in our way of exploring the stars. It rekindled the feelings I had as a child when I watched the Apollo missions launch into space and wondered if I'd get a chance someday to touch a distant planet or star. Nothing seemed impossible then. There was nothing that we couldn't accomplish. With this book, Bryan Ethier made me realize that we still have that same spirit living in all of us and that the dreams of our youth should never be forgotten. Just a wonderful, wonderful book that I hope will one day be treated as an American treasure."
2,Lack of depth and irrelevant subjects - a waste of money,"I was very disappointed with this book. I expected to read about being a young boy whose imagination was captured by the beginnings of the American manned-space program; how the courageous efforts of those involved in the Mercury program brought about a wave of pride in America; and that it was the dream of many boys and girls to travel into space and maybe go to the Moon!What I got was a book that talked a lot about the Space Shuttle program and child birth?!Having grown up with the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs (and being old enough to remember them!) I was eager to share in the memories of a kindred spirit, but found the author's recollections lacking. It seemed the author struggled to have enough subject matter to give the book sufficient length."
5,a most important book for Florida,"This is really one of the most important contributions to Florida history in recent years. Some may think that black people just disappeared during the Jim Crow era, but this book will disabuse them of that notion. It has it all, from stories to recipes to photographs, covering a part of history that is still almost studiously ignored hereabouts. I hope this will encourage others to do the kind of digging Marsha Phelts has done, because Florida's black beaches from the age of segregation are an endangered species. They should all be studied, documented, and placed on the National Register of Historic Places to preserve what remains from the endless bulldozers of developers. Cheers to the author for telling this story so well!"
1,Boring,"All the TV shows he mentioned were from around 1990, so I didn't have a clue what's he's talking about. If you wanna read a good nature book, then read Walden by Thoreau."
1,pretentious diatribe,"What kind of an experiment was this cable watching thing supposed to be? The guy goes on a hike and imagines he comes back full of some eternal ""wisdom"" and then sits down and watches TV for 1700 hours straight, and comes to the conclusion that the 1700 hours of TV watching were not particularly rewarding...! give me a break! well duh-of course watching tv for a month straight isnt rewarding!Its amazing that people sit down and write big books making these sorts of obvious points. In the end mcKibben succeeds in shining a damning light on our culture - not through his ""experiment"" but by publishing the book. A culture, where people can pretend to be clever intellectuals by making the kind of social experiments and delvering the kind of half baked ""insights"" as McKibben does, is in serious, serious trouble."
4,"Intriguing, If Not Topical...","This is a very interesting work, a long essay really, in which the author raises some important ideas. He also has a knack for turning a phrase. Unfortunately, he did not really grasp the significance of the nexus between TV and the Internet, and the book was written before social networking really got going, so the chapter on technology now feels a little stale. Still, I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for ammunition against television, not to mention everyone trying to figure out their own relationship with television."
4,Nature vs. Television,"McKibben questions the term ""information age"" and sets out to discover whether he can learn more from a day of television (24 hours of programing from each of 93 channels) or from a day of hiking in the mountains. Though the results are arbitrary, it is, nevertheless, an interesting read that poses thought-provoking questions about important issues for our society. Most striking is the quick-cut writing style that parodies an erratic channel clicker."
2,Foggy responses,"With due respect to another reviewer, Gaillardetz's book is the last place an RCIA candidate or confirmandi should go for guidance on how to understand an appropriate response by the faithful to Church teaching. Gaillardetz believes that only a very rigid form of heresy that involves the explicit rejection of a dogma impairs one's status with the Catholic Church. He even goes so far as to say that the rejection of morally-binding social doctrines (he cites Church teaching on cohabitation) ""does not in any way separate"" a person from communion with the Church. This is pure conjecture. Doctrines exist in order to establish boundaries around what is morally licit behavior. In other words, to go beyond those boundaries is to sin, and sinning does indeed impair one's communion with Christ and His Church. At any rate, on too many questions Gaillardetz provides foggy responses instead of clear answers."
2,Providing cover......,"Dr. Gaillardetz is a brilliant man and posesses a knowledge of the Church far greater than most can claim. However, having skimmed this book and having had the pleasure of hearing the author lecture, I find myself feeling that he's on a mission to legitimize a more relativistic form of Catholic Christianity which can proclaim itself at once orthodox and faithful to Christ and the intent of the Fathers while at the same time providing cover and legitimacy for those who seek the Church's accomodation and approval of a tepid 21st century interpretation of the Faith. How to do this? Imply that all those bulls and encyclicals aren't binding. I fear in Gaillardetz's perfect model of Catholic Christianity, the role of the Pope would be reduced to that of the preachy, doting father that the teenage child has no problem ignoring when convinient. Perhaps I am wrong and if so, I deeply apologize to Dr. Gaillardetz. But that is certainly the impression I get."
4,"Sit back, relax, and enjoy","I've heard of the poets Verlaine and Rimbaud and know a little about their poetry since I took French, but it was interesting to learn about their furious love affair while young adults. I'd heard about the ""Sacred Heart of Jesus"" but didn't have any idea where it started. I'd heard about the Castrati but it was interesting to learn details. This book is made up of interesting anecdotes, it's easy to read, and instructive. It's a relaxing read. A good book but not a great book."
1,Jumpstart Spelling Bee waste of $,"I have bought other Jumpstart products, but this is the absolutel worst one. The graphics are out-dated, the games are complex for a 1st grader to understand, let alone learn spelling. You are better off to buy an online teachers service to make cross-word and word-find puzzles - than to buy this cd."
1,Empty box,"The box I come near empty, and go away of this direction of sending on Wednesday, the 7th go to be until Sunday, the 11th in 4040 Galt Ocean Drive, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33308, please send my sunglases. Thank you."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I ORDERED A SPANISH VERSION OF PLAY. I GOT AN ANNOTATED THESAURUS INSTEAD. IT WAS TOTALLY USELESS AND INAPPROPRIATE.ALTHOUGH MY MONEY WAS REFUNDED, NO EFFORT WAS MADE ON YOUR PART TO SECURE MY DESIRED BOOK.I AM DISAPPOINTED. IF THERE WERE A NEGATIVE RATING, IT WOULD BE APPLICABLE.ALAN L MENKES. MD, MBA"
2,A book for experienced people only.,"This book certainly has a lot of information in it, but it is not lucid at all. This book is a hard read. The presentation is not done very well, and a lot of details get put off to the literature. I would actually recommend the FEM book by Braess instead. Only use this book as a reference."
4,Rick Springfield Rocks!!!,"This was a great tv movie. It made me remember how cute Rick is. The story revolves around twin girls, who switch places so that one can get over her problem with alcohol. She is a model, while the didter who takes her place is an art history major. She has to learn to be a model, and many funny and swwet things happen. It was very well done for a romance. I give it a thumbs up!!"
3,Was a good story,"I liked the movie. It wasn't the best for Rick Springfield, but I still enjoyed watching it."
1,Not what pictured,"I chose this item because of the picture. When it arrived it was an incredibly cheap camera that looked nothing like the pucture. The dome that was shipped is listed for $4 on other sites. If the store actually has the pictured item, I would be interested in purchasing it."
5,Safety,These are great and easy to install. Mixed with the real thing you can not tell which is which.
2,"Fun, but disappointing quality","While both of my boys enjoyed this, the plastic frame around the top and the top itself fractured and cracked very quickly in several places rendering it impossible for the boys to play with it unaided. It was not dropped or roughly treated - simple open and close use. While they enjoy it, it's alot of work holding the top on 'just so' so that the 'jack' can pop back up again. Would not recommend or buy again. Surely there are more sturdy options available - definitely for the money."
2,"Adequate, but that's all","Like so many of Chartrande's books in the Opsrey/Elite series, this tome is adequate, but that's all. The topic of what the troops of Santa Anna wore from the 1830's to the 1840's is difficult to research at best, and most of what is presented here is a re-hash of old hash. The author does offer a few illustrations that have seldom seen the light of day, but they tell us very little. (The sentry in Yucatan from 1827 wearing cotton civilian shirt and trousers with black belts for example) Chartrande ignores the special campaign uniforms worn by some of the dragoons for the Texas campaign. Also ignored are the rifle companies of the 1840 period which DID exist. Younghusband's plates are quite good, but his soldados look a little too well fed. You didn't get fat in the army to say the least! Lacking are plates showing the fatigue wear, the overcoat, the packs and accounterments. Maybe another author will tackle the subject, and I'll patiently wait until then."
4,Great buy,Received this as a Xmas gift and put it to immediate use. Just the right portion (15 wings) and convenience for getting rid of the bones. Eliminates much of the mess with the sauce. Excellent value.
3,3 OR 4 STARS AND WORTH THE LISTEN,"This CD is actually a combination of two different T. Lavitz projects. The Bad Habitz and also Players. The original Players band consisted of some fusion heavyweights whose credintials would blow you away. This CD is partly the reformed unit of that band and partly the Bad Habitz band. Both units play great. The players unit on this disc includes Dave Samuels, Rod Morgenstein, and Danny Gottlieb. The music is recorded well, although there are not many really high points. The track listing given above is incomplete by several songs. For interested drummers, Rod and Danny have an excellent drum duet (appropriately titled RAD) with Rod on acoustic drums and percussion and Danny on Electric."
2,Big Fan But Disappointed,"I love T's music and had never heard this CD, grabbed it for a few bucks so what's to loose right...? Popped it in on a 3 hr road trip. It's obviously a late 80's early 90's sounding ""contemporary jazz"" sounding piece of work. Honestly I probably wonn't listen to it again as nothing really grabbed me. I'm a drummer and the playing is un-inspiring frankly especially compared to the other material I've heard from Mr Lavitz. Coming back on road trip it ended up on the floor board for some reason...I think it's still there! Not worth picking up in my opinion.His best work is with the Dixie Dreggs and Jazz is Dead and 2 other solo albums I just can't remember the names of at the moment. Obviously I'm no professional reviewer! No dis-respect intended. I just bought it for the price...think it was $2.98."
2,NOT a grammar book,"this book is NOT a grammar book in the traditional sense. if one wants to learn a more proper form of english, one would do well to begin somewhere else. after one has attained a base level of grammatical knowledge, one might then return to this tome for further elucidation. at such a time, her treatise would probably enhance one's analytical expertise in the syntactic and/or symantic arenas of endeavor. one might say that one intends to do so at a later point in time, since one prefers to improve oneself, don't one?"
2,incorrectly advertised,"Please note that the product is incorrectly labelled. They combined the name of two different products. This is a Pro1D Filter with DMC, not a Super HMC."
1,"No variety, all songs and guitar solo are similar .",Armik guitar's techniques are not professional. He plays the same melody over and over such as his other albums.
2,Don't fall for it,It's strictly a novelty item; its sounds exactly like a harmonica so don't get exited if you think you got some French horns all of the sudden.
3,Title is misleading,"I was slightly disappointed after reading this book. The title gives an impression of military strategy on the battlefield level. This book offered very little of that. Most concepts, strategies, and thoughts were from the thirty thousand feet level. I was hoping for a book which outlined campaigns with battlefield maps, and greater descriptions of the eb and flow of the combat. Most battles were described in a paragraph or a two. That was very disappointing. The book did give good background information on why things happened, and the history of the conflict. But with a title of ""Decisive Encounters"" I was expecting more ""decisive encounters""."
4,Hard,"I enjoyed this one. The floor exercises at the end are awful, as in holy crap they will push you. I've gotten better, but I can barely keep up with them. Abs o' steel."
3,"OKay, but not what I expected","I bought this DVD because I badly needed to work on my abs. While I'm sweating and out of breath within the first 15-20 minutes, I feel nothing in my abs. No matter how hard I try to focus on my abs, it just doesn't happen. I found this to be a better cardio workout than and abs workout."
5,Billy Banks Rocks,This DVD is really good. You will be seriously feeling your abs by the time you finish. He starts off with standing ab work and then ends with on the floor work which I have yet to conquer. I think even Shelly was crying at the end. It's worth the pain though and I can already see a difference after using for a couple of weeks.
4,Nice workout,It was a good work out seemed really balanced and though out for maximum results. I have other tapes they too are the right amount of intense without being ridiculous.
4,Good ab workout,Been using about 3 weeks. Definitely feel my abs getting tighter. I alternate with other Tae Bo workouts. Would recomment to friends.
4,Ab Killer,This DVD was the best purchase that I have made in a long time. I am a mother of three getting in shape for the summer and I am so happy that I discovered this DVD. Billy Blanks works the abdominal area and gives you exactly what the title of the DVD entails. I have been doing this DVD for at least three weeks now and the results are substantial.
4,LOVE IT!!!,"I'm looking to lose weight just like everyone else and thought this DVD would be great! And for the most part, it is! I love Billy though and have loved Tae-Bo since it first came out and I know I'd love this DVD. I just wish Shelly would SHUT UP! I can understand the excitement and enthusiasm, but she is TOO annoying and distracting. Other than that, another fabulous production. Billy seems to be a very caring person and his talk at the end directed at the audience seems to be very genuine and heartfelt. I'm a mother, but not a new mother by any means and I still felt like he was talking to me.One more thing... I don't know WHAT the participants are saying, but I like to say Hot Sauce! Get the DVD and you'll know what I mean."
3,not as insane as i expected...,"This is pretty good, i'm not amazed...i feel it more in my back than in my abs. I'm giving it 3 stars though because I think it will have more affect once i'm a little better at doing the exercises straight through."
2,Not a fan,"I really wanted to get a connection with Billy Blanks work outs but for some reason I just didn't feel that connection his work out to me is just not my style, so I based my 2 stars on that reason. It might work out for you, It just didn't work out for me. Oh one other thing his back up crew in this video the blonde that's near the front..she was so irritating I wanted her to shut up I felt like she was on some kind of hype drug."
3,It's okay.,"Sometimes, I think this workout is more for the legs than the abs. I have been doing ab work for years and years, and I always push myself. I really didn't feel like this worked the abs as much as it worked the legs. You are in a wide squat position for a very long time, and it really kills. The lying down portion of the ab workout was really good. I wish they had more of that."
5,Christmas Almanack Presents Christmas Around the World,"The Christmas Almanack presents an amazingly thorough picture of Christmas around the world throughout history. It contains something for everyone who enjoys the Christmas season: stories, legends, words to holiday songs, recipes, and more. The Christmas season wouldn't be complete in our home without a copy of this book to browse and savor and share with guests. We discovered this book in 1979 and enjoy it every year."
5,A good companion for the Experience...,"""Turn On, Tune In, Droup Out"" happens to be one great CD. I have read most of Dr. Leary's books, and even got some CDs, but listening to this CD really gave me some kind of flash back. For those who are interested in knowing what it was like to attend Dr. Leary's Psychedelic Experiences, I would suggest that you give it a try. Just by closing your eyes and listening to Dr. Leary's voice you can find yourself projected in some totally unknow corner of your mind."
4,Interesting,"This audio is interesting to hear if you are curious about the personality and message of Dr. Leary. This audio was recorded with a soft spoken voice directed to young people in particular living in societies dominated by men and women over 30 who assert their orthodox values in an attempt to foster acceptable behavior in the mind of growing individuals. It's a fine message, with a bit of narrative as well."
3,beyond lifes better,this c.d is where a lot of diologue on beyond life with timothy leary is culled from.this album has not aged well with its very primitive sounds(a simple repetitive gong represents conciousness moving to inner-space)but i guess thats part of the appeal.its funny how at the time this would have blown(probably already blown!) minds!!still interesting for leary 'fans'or people interested in counter-culture relics.buy beyond life.
3,More difficult to use,"I bought this polarizer for my Canon IS 17-85 mm lens and think the picture quality is good. The reason I chose this thin polarizer was to reduce the possibility of vignetting (and I haven't experienced any).But the slim design also gives some troubles when it comes to turning the filter to get the desired effect, simply because it is hard to get a ok grip on the turning ring without touching the glass itself. I never had this kind of trouble with the polarizer I use with my 58mm diameter lens.Also I experienced that the original lens cap won't fit when the filter is attached."
4,Am happy with JumpStart Typing for my 9 year old daughter.,"My daugher has happily substituted the games in JumpStart Typing for the Neopets arcade games she was playing before. The program does a good job at enforcing acquiring new material by having a ""team strength bar"" that dimishes to zero as you make mistakes while playing; to play more, you have to do some lesson work until it is back up to 100%. It also steadily makes the games harder as you learn more letters and get better. The result is overall quite a bit more work than just playing regular games, but the net is still positive. However, some parental encouragment is needed;our rule is that JumpStart Typing time is unlimited, after homework and other duties have been met, while all other computer use is limited to 90 minutes a week. The other typing programs I looked at woudl all have required a little more parental help and encouragement. A good value."
3,SpongeBob Typing is more Fun,"My 7 and 9 year old boys could benefit from learning touch typing. I bought this program and they used it over Christmas vacation, but then never went back. I also bought SpongeBob typing and found it was more engaging. They still don't know how to touch type, but at least this is a first step."
2,Jumpstart Typing (PC and MAC),"This product will not work on Mac. The plastic wrapper states that it will work for Mac or PC. When I opened the product, I found out that it was only for PC. Can't return it because I opened it. Not happy with this purchase at all."
1,Wrong product shipped,"Was very disappointed to have the person I gave this to come back to me with the news that it does not work on the Mac. Even thought the description above has ""(PC & Mac)"" in it. Not worth returning."
5,Jumpstart Typing,"Great beginning typing program for kids. Good graphics, entertaining ""storyline"", small goals along the way and ""prizes"" to be won. The progression of key introduction is slow and doable, as opposed to other programs out there."
5,Priceless skill on a fun platform,"I love this software and recommend it to anyone who will listen! I bought this software for my daughter eight years ago, when she was 5. She played it for several years, at first with my assistance, and mastered the PRICELESS skill of touch typing! To this day, she is the only one in her private school class who can type -- and at around 80 wpm -- without glancing at her keyboard! Writing and submitting homework is done by typing at a speed only limited by the pace of her thoughts. I entirely attribute this must-have skill to ""Jump Start Typing."" She learned the home positions, took speed typing tests, and played fun sports games all in an effort to free the coach! The result has made writing for homework and pleasure on the computer a breeze!!"
4,A Review - By Rocky A. - A Grade 3 Student,"My favourite character is Tashamio because he is brave and clever. I wonder who is the Mysterious Wonder? Moskane is my second favourite character because he is smart. This is my second favourite book of the year. I can't wait to read the next book, ""The Under River Case."" I wish the author luck to publish over 1,000,000 copies of the next book. Is Tashamio and Moskane going to be in your next book?Is the number doctor a good job? in your book, two kids tried to figure out who the Mysterios Wonder is. In fact, I'm trying to figutre out who the Mysterios Wonder is too. My favourite chapter is #23 because they get to play video games with Mr. Okuuno.The book wasn't to easy for me to read. It took me three weks to finish. The story was long but I enjoyed reading it.Sincerely,Rocky A."
3,Mellow romance...,"It wasn't an exciting movie; sort of guessed there was more to it (won't say what in case someone is keen to buy the DVD).The romance could have started sooner, but did enjoy the mellowness of it all.Never seen the actress in a movie, but enjoyed her character in this one. Would have enjoyed a bit more wit from the detective.Loved the elderly neighbour - she was a hoot.Looking for a light, romantic, touch of comedy at times, then get this DVD."
2,"Ahhh, Ms. Huffman wasn't enough","This is supposed to be a romance, I think--or maybe a mystery--or a thriller--or a comedy. Kim Huffman decorates an otherwise dreary mish-mosh, but it is beyond her acting ability and girl-next-door appearance. The detective tries to be so serious and tough. The other assorted players are one dimensional: the sister with marital problems, her straying husband, the neighbors, the female prosecutor, the villain, etc.Granted, there's not much in the script to work with, and the ending is blushingly silly silly silly. The director didn't put up much of a fight to make this watchable. It was made for TV movie, a genre famous for its shallowness. Only Kim Huffman seemed to give this a genuine effort. She's not exactly beautiful, nor does she have a great figure, but she has an appeal as a young woman you might meet anywhere."
4,What Makes this Movie Good Is,"the undeniable chemistry these two actors have, it wouldn't worked otherwise. The storyline was pleasant, I've seen worse. I was very pleased with this movie."
4,damn good,"A damn good record although a little different than their first. In ""This Darkened Heart"" the metal definitely outweighs the core in ""metalcore"". Great guitar work with some Gothenburg inspired riffs. Phil's vocal range has expanded ranging from his low militaristic style to a new higher-pitched scream with even some clean vocals mixed in. Reminds me of Jesse Leach, the former vocalist for KSE. Top-notch production as well. This and the new God Forbid are two of the best albums I have picked up so far this year. Highly recommended."
4,What the hell happened?,"I dont get it. I just dont get it. This album should have been the one to break All That Remains out from the underground, but it doesnt. They still remained one of the metalcore scene's lesser known bands, and Phil Labonte's old band, Shadows Fall, outsold them, 10 to 1.Whoever slept on this album has no idea what they missed. The Riffs are heavy, the vocals pissed and nasty, the lyrics angry and sorrrowfull at the same time, every thing that has come to characterize the metalcore scene, but still, this band went unnoticed. OPEN YOUR EARS PEOPLE!!! Stop listening to second rate bands, and pick up this album, and Their new one, ""The Fall Of IDEALs"" and be prepared to be blown away!"
4,Great!,"Immediately when I heard this album, I thought of Killswitch Engage, but as I began listening to it more in dept I realized that they have their own unique style. The rythm guitars are absolutely amazing with tempo changes and downright brutal heaviness. The solos are precise and are no doubt classically influenced (classic metal that is--Malmsteen, etc.). The drums and bass make the transition from verse to bridge to chorus, smooth and precise. The vocals are KSE'ish, but are forgivable due to the pure emotion behind them. If these guys would take out the signature Killswitch Engage pick slides, this would've received a five from me. This album is definitely worth owning. Buy the cd, download, or whatever. But turn the volume up!!"
5,Wow.,"Guitars that drive like being slapped with a tire iron. Amazing vocals, metal is alive and well in this band. A breath of fresh air from the cliche nu-metal crapola. Great to hear a band that has talent and actually uses it. 5 stars easily."
4,"This is metal, no question about it","I have to make something clear. Breakdowns do not mean metalcore. They are an essential part of metalcore, but metal bands do them too. With that said, This Darkened Heart is a full fledged metal album. From the acoustic bit that opens the album, to the thrashy title track at the end, it contains buzzsaw riffs, tight drumming, and well-crafted soloing. A big reason this band is passed off as metalcore is because of the vocals. They do resemble that metalcore style, but the music speaks for itself. If you like straight-up metal, do yourself a favor and buy this record."
5,Amazing,"I was getting really sick of cliched metalcore, like Hatebreed, Killswitch, Shadows Fall etc... and then I was introduced to All that Remains. I'm a guy who usually listens to black metal/death metal and isn't into the hardcore/metal scene, but this album is amazing. Sure it has it's hardcore, but there's so much more. It has it's melodic death (which KsE fails in their new album) and it's thrash (reminds me of Exodus, Testament etc...). It's also an album that I can listen to the whole way through (unlike borecore bands such as As I Lay Dying and Bleeding Through). If your'e planning to get The War Within or Ashes of the Wake, get this instead. You'll be glad you did. 10/10"
1,I've heard better.,"Hmm, vocals like in-flames and sounds like shadowsfall? You'll think thats good but the guys from all that remains, didn't do a good job whats so ever. Not even a bit impressive and insted of trying to rip other bands off to came fof like you should be praise like those bands? Why dont you, actullie, write and play your own music? Is that to much to ask ? Do not bother."
5,one of the best bands,"when phil left shadows fall, i was anxious to see what he would come up with. All That Remains first cd was nothing special but when This Darkened Heart came out, the world stopped. this cd is amazing. the solos are great, 2 stepping parts, breakdowns galore, and he can actually sing good! go get this if you havent already. its been out for a while"
3,Disappointed,"The book was ok, but it did not come in on time and I therefore did not get a chance to really use it. I needed it before I left the country, but it did not come in until almost 2 weeks after I left."
5,Tamagotchi Butterflies,"Just what she wanted. My daughter has a lot of fun with this. She has two, and also has the Nintendo DS game that they interact with. FUN!!"
4,Happy,"Bigger than I expected, which was good. The only problem is my toddler seems to disconnect the top extended part, but it is easily fixed by snapping it back into place. Other than that, he loves Cranky."
4,"My son was super excited, so I was too!!","It was a bit larger than I expected, but my son could not have been happier than when he opened the box!"
4,Just what my 4 yr old wanted.,Cranky the Crane came just as described. It shipped quickly and arrived when expected. My son played with it right out of the box with his other Thomas and friends toys.
3,My Son Loves This Toy,My son absolutely loves this toy. The only problem is the front arm comes off very easily. We have already gone through two of these.
3,Dream come true!,"This toy was a hit for my 4 year old Thomas fan! It has brought hours of fun for my son and his friends. With the magnet, my son learns about magnetism and also weight."
3,Not Necessarily the Last Giant of Beringia,"A good read for someone who is a beginner or just beginning to be interest in Beringia.I was disappointed that it did not contain data from the explosion of research that has occurred in the last 10 - 15 years in Beringia, from sea bed core drillings to off-shore cave exploration. Along with a multitude of core drilling from glaciers that can now more accurately be analyzed. I had hoped for more scientific date especially since there has been so much work done up there recently.The biography of the major pioneer in the field was interesting as a passing by-line to the overall picture.The book was well written, interesting, held my attention, not too long and generally a good read - just light on the science.Overall a book for beginners."
4,Burning Plain,"It was a bit confusing at first because the movie travels back and forth in time. I thought the acting was good, the plot captivating."
2,"Good Cast, Slow Plot",Story line is interesting but the plot bounces around a lot. We've all seen lots of movies that pivot between the present and the past but in this movie the pivoting doesn't flow quite as well as it should have. Interesting theme though. About 2/3 through the movie you realize the underlying plot.
2,Tedious,Movie lasts less than 2 hours. Seemed like 3 hours. Characters and script generally not believable. This is directorial debut of a screenwriter. Lack of directorial experience shows. Excellent cast wasted.
2,This movie needs to come with a guidebook...,"Great cast - great acting, but ?????? Maybe after watching it another time it will make more sense and all the jumping around won't bug me as much the first time?"
2,Drama for the sake of drama,"I agree with most other reviewers that the story was not clear at the beginning going back and forth in time (not too talk that the younger version of the main character and her did not look alike at all except for the blonde hair). The whole story line did not make any sense. So she kills her mother and her lover and AFTER THIS she starts dating the son of her mother's lover??? Don't you go to prison if you do this? How quilty was she actually feeling? OK, we get it that she suffering years afterwards and then all of a sudden everything is fine after she gets her daughter's forgiveness (which seemed a little quick) although I agree that the action seems to be moving so slowly. The only reason I am giving two starts is because of the high quality of picture and the acting of the two main characters. If you love drama for the sake of drama (without much meaning and depth inside), this might be a good movie."
3,Burning Plain,I thought it was hard to follow the plot in this movie. I don't kow if I would buy it or not?
2,hum,not my favorite type of movie. I watched because of the cast members.I was just not excited about the story line.
4,great cast but story jumps back and forward,Interesting story but quite believable. Plenty of nudity but no violence. Need to concentrate because storyline jumps back and forth
1,very depressing and graphic,"started watching this and just didn't feel like finishing. What could have been an interesting storyline was very disjointed, jumping back and forth in time, pretty graphic sex scences that don't add anything to the story..."
1,Disappointing...,"With such a strong cast, I was unpleasantly surprised. Stopped watching after 15min because the acting seemed flat, and the movie unappealing."
2,not very good,film was poorly made. Not worth renting or buying. Films offered by Amazon should be of better quality and should be reviewed before release
1,"Horrible, don't waste your time.","The action goes back and forth between the present and the past which makes the movie difficult to understand; are they in the present or the past? Is that blonde woman the mother or the daughter? Is that man the father or the son? Maybe I was drowsy because of the antihistamine I took? Or, maybe Burning Plain made me drowsy!?"
3,Almost Too Perfect,"Here is a movie that seems clearly indebted to John Sayles' ""Lone Star"". It shares the same kind of elliptical story line, and generation-spanning themes of forbidden love, racial and sexual taboos, tragedy, guilt and redemption . It even has a musical score featuring heavily reverbed alt-country guitar.It's such a beautifully shot and constructed film that it is hard to isolate the things that undermine it. Maybe it comes down to this: too many motifs weaving in and out, too many empty symbols. It's like a symphony by a composer who hits all the right notes, but doesn't succeed in creating a living work that truly breathes.I still recommend watching it... if for nothing more in that it's one of Charlize Theron's best ""turns"" as an actress, and for the wonderful cinematography."
3,Takes awhile to rev up,"At first, the time-shifting and dual story line are a little confusing. What's going on here? Seems to be about two unrelated women whoo are finding love in the wrong places. Eventually, it all comes together, but not until the end. I didn't quite see it coming, either. I had to pause this a few times because I got bored and went off to do something else. It's not a very compelling story, despite the big-name cast. I did like the indie soundtrack which fit the lonely images of Mexico, southern California and Washington state very well."
2,not the greatest,"just wasn't a well done movie,Jennifer Lawrence was good as usual, I've was disappointed with Charlese Theron she is a great actress and this did not do her talents justis"
2,Kind of slutty for such quality actresses,This film starred 3 excellent actresses and I can't understand why any of them agreed to take on the roles in this movie.
3,Didn't watch it all,"I haven't actually watched it all the way through. I might finish it when I get the time, I'd rather not have rated it til then."
4,Complex story Line,Weaves a story of how simple trangressions early in life turn into life-long consequences. The movie jumps back and forth from the character's current adult life and back to their early days without much anouncement. Need to pay attention inorder to put the complex pieces together into a very intriguing story!
3,Burning Plain,Interesting subject. Powerful acting. Chalize shows great sensitivity in the portraying the role. WIll look forward to more workd from the director.
2,Another old movie,Doing this review for my mom who couldn't finish the movie. It was another older movie that just did not keep her interest.
1,skip it dnt watch it,this movie is a load of crap not worth watching please don't waste your time the story line is horrible.
1,Movie was lousy.,"movie was lousy, slow moving, no plot, most scenes were dark, volume control was lousy, ending was blah. I do not rate this item."
1,Waste of time,"Awful movie, no point to it at all. It amazes me what Hollywood puts out as 'art'. Dont waste your time, just a big downer."
4,FASCINATING,Very intriguing story. The jump between the past and present was a bit disconcerting and it took me forever to figure out who the young girl was supposed to be; but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Two great actresses made it even more interesting and the girl who played the young Charlise Theron was excellent.
5,The Essential Lecuona,"While some of these songs are known, most are not, and all lovers of Lecuona and Cuban music will be thrilled to experience this collection. It is stylishly sung, with some ravishing pianissimi, and a lot of atmosphere. I felt I was back in Havana! A must-have!"
4,Good for beginners,"Its a great beginners canning book. Has lots of basic recepies, easy to read.The only thing I had an issue was determining the jelling point. According to this book you can use a thermometer or a ""spoon test"", the spoon test did not work for me, so I way over cooked my first 2 jellies, by using the thermometer I didn't have any issues."
3,I want to give this book 5 stars...,"But can't. I am relatively new to canning, but have had some experience in the past. The Ball Blue Book is an excellent place to start for anyone wanting to get their ""feet wet"". Many of the recipes are clear and concise; there are many easy to follow charts and basics. With that said, just as many recipes seem to be ""off"". Too much or too little of this or that. Too much sugar, too much vinegar, too little cooking time.Overall, the Ball Blue Book is a great place for the beginning canner to start, but you will quickly out grow this book if you are doing more than making jam."
5,"THE bible of canning & freezing fruit, vegetables, jams, etc","A must-have book if you want to can, freeze, make jam, applesauce, pickles, etc., whether you have an expensive pressure canner or a simple large pot. My grandmother had a copy of this book when I was a child. The recipes are simple and tested by generations. The instructions are clear and use standard kitchen supplies. There is also a nice section that explains how water bath canning works and how to do it right. With this book and a nearby pick-your-own farm (I find them at www.pickyourown.org) you can get the fruit inexpensively then make your own jam, preserves, applesauce, etc without chemicals or preservatives."
3,"Very handy, but...","Has some very useful--no, essential-- information in it, but I was a little disappointed because this is *not* what I would call a soft-cover book. It's more like a magazine. The paper is relatively thin, and slick (glossy coated like a magazine). For something I want to keep for years, I worry about it getting torn or spilled and splattered on. The recipes are very brief, and a little less detailed than I would've liked, but are perfectly adequate for an experienced canner. There are minimal photographs, and the information is organized thoughtfully, making finding the recipes easy. There is a four-page index at the back (along with a glossary of terms) that makes finding any recipe in the book quick and easy.On the whole, I'm glad to own this book and will be making good use of it. For the price, it's an excellent addition to my library. I just wish it was a little sturdier."
4,"four stars, beware....","My mother and I have canned for years, she is from the depression era. This is a good basic book, but beware, cooking times for chutneys is about 4 hours short. the stuff willtaste like vinegar.The other ball book is much more complete. The sugar in these rescipes is very high!!! The other ball book has a better intro to explain when you can change sugar ratio. Sugar and vinegar ratios are not, NOT, random numbers. Nor is cooking time!!!! several kinds of food posioning occur when directions are not understood. Several results in death,,, check the pioneer journals. good luck, with caution."
4,best book on food preservation,"This book keeps getting better and better with each new addition. I believe my aunt used it in Vermont in the 40's. The addition of new technology for methods such as dehydration, is most welcome The recipes show us why we want to preserve all this food. I would have given the higheat rating but I am always expecting something new to come along and give us new incentives."
1,Thought it was a standard??,"Pickle recipe is horrid... Get your info from the web... This book is about half of what you can research yourself.. First year pickling, did pickles by the book, nasty... Green beans off Internet recipe, AMAZING!"
3,a little to involved,"Nice book, but I found it to be a bit involved. I found easier recipies on line."
4,Useful,I bought this book because I have gotten into canning and needed a book for a guide. I look forward to other books on canning more than just relishes and such.
5,Helps keep the fresh-from-the-garden feeling through the winter!,"Although every time I drag out the canning kettle, the jars, the lids, I wonder...is it worth it? The answer is yes! To have delicious food, from your garden, in February when the snow is on the ground and the cold wind is blowing is wonderful. The Ball Blue Book has great recipes and easy to follow directions. It is the only book to have!"
5,Wonderful book,"I was so surprised to recive my purchase in less time than promised, and I was so happy to get the 100th Anniversary edition. I like to make jams and jellies and this book has wonderful ideas. It is very easy to read and it has a lot of information. I'm now considering buying a pressure canner to can veggies. It has very good information about other types of food preservation, which I think will save my money. It's a very helpful book for begginers, like me."
5,best book on preserving food!,"this has got to be the best! i've always heard that it was referred as the canners bible, and people sure weren't kidding! there are recipes for grape jam/jelly that you can make out of grape juice! so much information!"
5,Great and informative book!,I am a first time canner this book really helped me become a great canner. The insturctions were easy. I am happy that I purchased this book.
4,save yr money,"If you think you may like this book, and it is a nice book by the way,save your money and postage. You can buy the idenitical book at Walmart for $5.95. Wish I had gone there first!"
2,Don't like the way it's organized and recipe quantities are suspect.,"Only used this book for two recipes so far, fig jam and peach jam. The peach jam recipe calls for 1 quart of diced peaches, but that gives about 10 tiny pieces of peach per half pint jar, the rest of the jar being liquid/jelly. If I wanted jelly I'd have used a jelly recipe. Also the book's organization is difficult. You have to flip back and forth between the recipes and the directions for the canner method, or freezer tips, etc. And lord knows, they could put more warnings about not doubling recipes in prominent places so I don't have to search around for this info. This might be the Bible of canning, but I think it has some more editing and rearranging to do."
4,Very good guide,This book has all you need to know in order to get started in canning. I'm sure we'll use it a lot.
5,Rober Gordon the lost voice of rock n roll!,Robert Gordon has one of those rare voices like Elvis and Johnny Cash andOrbison! He's one of those guys that just came out at the wrong time butshould be considered one of the greats! singing great rockabilly rock n rolland country like nobody else. if you never heard him you will love this guy!
4,Hilarious Hijinks,"A movie that was almost banned in Boston, This movie is one of the funniest screwball comedies of the 40's. Eddie Bracken's rubber legs would make the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz envious.Betty Hutton is A delight and the supporting cast is excellent, especially the smart mouthed little sister. Highly recommended."
5,The funniest movie,I've watched this dozens of times and know the ending and all the jokes but I still laugh my brains out every time I see it. Hutton and Bracken (and everyone else in it) are hilarious. The writing is superb. I love all Sturges' films but this is my favorite.
5,"As usual, Sturges creates memorable, hysterical characters","If you've never seen a Preston Sturges film before, what delights you've been missing! MIRACLE AT MORGAN'S CREEK was daring in its day, dealing with unwed pregnancy, social ostracism and political hypocrisy. Think that mix can be funny? More than funny. It is both hysterically funny and quite poignant. Eddie Bracken has never been better, and the whole crew of Sturges regulars is brilliant."
4,"Nifty, hilarious war-time comedy!","One of the best of the zany comedies of the 1940s. Betty Hutton and Eddie Bracken sparkle together in a raucously, good-natured, topical comedy of its day. The strong supporting cast delightfully adds to the frantic, ""beat the stork"" nonsense. Hutton's full-throttle personality is tempered by Bracken's puppy love for her, and director Preston Sturges' sure hand keeps the hilarity rollicking all the way from start to wacky labor room finale."
5,One of the funniest films of All Time!,"This is arguably Preston Sturges best film, 'The Lady Eve' and 'Sullivans Travels' are his other masterpieces. This film is pure delight, a lot of fun and very daring for its times. Eddie Bracken is hilarious as the innocent Norval, and so are Betty Hutton and Diana Lynn. Great war-time comedy that is pure fun. Highly recommended, a guaranteed good time and great fun. If you're looking for a very funny comedy, look no further. Preston Sturges shows us he has the 'magic' touch. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 9!"
5,A Christmas Miracle,"That Preston Sturges managed to get this perversion of the Christmas story past the censors is a miracle all on its own. Betty Hutton's and Eddie Bracken's peculiar talents are a perfect fit for this story about greatness thrust upon an unlikely recipient.Sturges's crazy combination of really smart banter, simple-minded slapstick and a perfect sense of comic timing works miracles with a great supporting cast: Diana Lynn, William Demarest, Julius Tannen and Porter Hall."
3,Solid tale of Romans in Germany,"This is a well-written historical novel about the adventures of two brothers serving with the Roman legions in Germany, a hundred years or so after Julius Caesar. For a better sample of this author's work, try The Legions of the Mist, which she wrote under her real name. She clearly loves that period in history, and has done her research."
1,Do Not Buy This Book!!,"As the author of this particular Justice House book, I ask that you not support this publisher with the purchase of this book. They have stolen my property and are publishing, selling and printing this edition without my consent and or a legal contract signed by me.Please purchase a new edition published by Black Car Publishing SO DEAD, MY LOVE. That is the only legal, authorized edition of this novel that I approve of.Patty G. HendersonSo Dead, My Love"
3,Unexpected problem,"I have owned lexar media in the past and it has been reliable and functional. Recently, however, I ran into an issue that came as an unpleasant surprise. I purchased an Olympus evolt e-500 camera. It is a great camera and works fabulously. but when I tried to use the lexmar media 4x in the camera, it caused a ""card error"" that corrupted the camera for any form of memory card. The result was either a costly repair or an exchange of a brand new camera. Just exercise caution with this unreported flaw."
4,A great Michigan book,"A great book about all the things that make Michigan memorable. I got this book for my 3 year old and found the text a little too involved for a toddler, but great for my elementary age nephews. My sister lives in Florida and she loves to see all the Michigan things she misses while reading a book to her kids."
2,"Only 4 months, the BT-GPS went dead","I've got the WP205 with a Bluetooth GPS. The GPS couldn't communicate with the PDA after used only for 4 months. During use, the PDA got freezed frequently. Sometimes, even the SD card couldn't be read. It only support an SD card up to 1G. Also be reminded that you got only 90 days warranties, not one year."
2,Poor,"Was very dissapointed in this product, re-finished a wood swim deck on my inboard/outboard. Over one winter the finish is peeling"
4,"Very Enjoyable, Even If Not Groundbreaking","A real enjoyable collection of tracks, many of which make you wonder about those acts which have been chosen for the entire unplugged CD routine. Neil Young, Eric Clapton, 10000 Maniacs, Bob Dylan, Tony Bennett, and Nirvana were all deserving. But Babyface? Mariah Carey? Maxwell???? Thankfully, at least they don't appear on this collection. Few of those appearing here don't belong. (I have to wonder why Dylan, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Bennett were not included though!) A note to MTV....time for a second ""Collection"" as well as full unplugged CD's by Tori Amos and Stevie Ray Vaughn!!!!"
3,How can you know how much your buying if the measurements aren't exact.,The roll is obviously longer than 12 inches but the measurements are not right. How can I know what I'm buying or how much to buy if I don't know the length of the fense???? Please put the right measurement on this product so that I can evaluate if I want to pay that much or not.
2,The cover picture is definitely the most creative part of the album,"This was pretty big when it came out, but as we've unfortunately learned again and again over the course of the last decade, a much-hyped album is not always a great one. This album, which is barely 30 minutes long, pretty much gets weighed down by the fact that these girls can barely sing, and their producer(s) don't exactly work their you-know-whats off trying to come up with fresh and exciting sounds to compliment the stale singing. That cover art is cute, though."
1,The book is rubbish,"I am not sure why the other reviewers are glorifying a book that throws down equations without explaining any of their terms. Essentially, the authors try to cover a lot of material, but none are covered in great detail. I would stay clear of this and stick to another to learn more on OFDM and MCM."
5,Happy purchase!,This book arrived as promised and in excellent condidion. I ordered it as an addition to a collection of English notables and history
3,Nothing special here,"A great bargain. Most of these are familiar, basic recipes, but the price is right, so I would recommend it as a good starter."
3,Micheal Jackson- The King,Very nice I enjoyed any thing about Michael Jackson.He is truly the King of Pop forever.
5,A great choice!,"This video does an excellent job demonstrating helpful exercises that will build muscle and increase flexibility. The importantance of a strong and limber body are emphasized as that is a key factor in being a good tumbler. Technical aspects are clearly broken down to ensure that the viewer learns and masters the skills. As the coach of a competitive gymnastics team, I find this video a fantastic way to teach my beginning gymnasts. It can also be easily used at home. Anyone interested in learning gymnastics should consider purchasing this video!"
5,funny and true,"Wenzel will have a long career if he keeps writing with as many sharp and hilarious edges as he does in his second New York comedy (after Lit Life, which was also fantastic.) Highly recommended."
4,"Good, But Too Long","This was a very good and well written book. However, I thought it was too long. I thought the author could have told the same story by making this book 1/4 shorter. Definitely read this book though. It is worth it."
4,Good Knickers,"I like these a lot, but the one thing i would say is that i wasnt quite prepared for the length. if you have slightly larger than normal thighs, these are going to ride up and bunch up in your crotch. which can get annoying. other than that, i like."
4,Thinking Smarter Not Harder,"In today's hectic, technology numbed business world, we fail to remember the human component in business. Abraham's book weaves the necessary creative personal elements into the practical application of successful business strategies. Everyone from entrepreneurs to CEO's should have their own flight plan for success supported by specific action steps to guarantee their success. This book was an easy read and I especially enjoyed how Abraham recognized that many of the complex problems in business can sometimes be solved with simple solutions."
2,Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got,"I purchased this book based primarily on the strong endorsements found here via these reviews. I must admit, that I am disappointed with the content and scope of this book. The topics are broad-brushed and extremely basic-- and I find Jay's insights both uninspired and less than insightful. Another reviewer indicated that this has all been done before and I have to agree...It has been done before and done better. I am a marketing and product management professional- with 20+ years of experience. I had hoped for some bits of information that would add new tools to my professional arsenal- no such luck"
5,Getting Everything You Can Out of All You'Ve Got,"Best darn book on marketing and optimizing your business and your life I've every read. You'll be cheating yourself if you don't read this book. Frank Candy, Founder and President, American Speakers Bureau and Internet Marketing E-commerce Guild"
2,A little too simple,"Abraham's book was quite a disapointment. His suggestions are so trite and obvious. I'm sure the author knows his stuff, but I saw nothing suggestive of either his 5K an hour worth, nor the price of the book."
3,Not What I Expected or Wanted.,Material is good but i expected this audio tape to deal with individual motivational and sales issues. this tape would likely be great for a small to medium size buiness looking for creative ways to market or advertise themselves. don't buy if you are looking for ways to make yourself better in a sales job. you won't find any.
5,A road map for creative thought and limitless performance,"Jay's new work is a trailblazing and illuminating path for those seeking a way out of the jungle of tech talk buzzwords and the virtual dumping of endless business related methodology that we have to swim through daily. His ideas and messages are clear, concise, simple to capture and put into use in whatever endeavor you are involved in. Jay's genius is in conveying the ""truly important stuff"" in easy-to-execute information and ideas, not always an easy task for a generalist book. Whatever you do in your world of work, this new work by Jay Abraham delivers. It is a must read for anyone serious about their future!"
4,A lot of useful tips,"Even though I'm about three fourth's of the way through the book, I've found a lot of useful marketing tips and advice that I'm starting to implement in my business - well worth the price!!!"
2,"For vinyl, plastics, carpet, and velour","COLOR COAT is formulated to match, restore or change color on most vinyl surfaces, flexible and rigid plastics, carpet and velour. COLOR COAT is fade resistant, flexible and is a permanent coating.Currently (as of May 28, 2010) available in over 50 colors including 3 blacks, 3 clears and a selection of OEM automotive, bus and marine colors."
4,Works as promised,"Bump Patrol works very well as described. In fact it's the only method for me to prevent the ugly razor bumps.My only frustration is that the size is not stated in the listing, hence the 4-star rating. It's half an ounce for those who wonder.Price looks attractive at first but keep in mind that the 4 oz bottle is way better value."
4,Excellent short history,"This is an excellent short history of Ukraine's early 20th Century armies. Sometimes (most times) the side that they were on was not always the ""right"" side. But in the face of Tsarist and then Soviet occupation Ukrainians had difficult choices to make. As an American of Ukrainian ancestry I am proud of every Ukrainian soldier no matter what uniform they wore. In their own way they were fighting to liberate their or their parental homeland. This book gives a good overview of how the struggle began in earnest; it is well written, historically accurate and wonderfully illustrated. Nice job to all the contributors."
4,A Subject Requring More Scholarly Work,Thanks to Osprey for taking on Ukrainian military history which is extremely rich but seldom examined. I greatly appreciated their balanced approach to the ambiguity that has impacted Ukrainian forces from the Russian Revolution and including World War 2. What is incredibily fascinating is the post second world war accounts of the anti-Soviet action taken by Ukrainian irregulars. Hard to imagine battalion size battles up to 1955 which no one heard about at the time. We need a definitive account on that subject.
5,Have Mercy Reverend Billy!,"I am 50 yers old and been playing electric blues/rock most of my life. I know the real thing from the counterfeit, and Billy Gibbons is the ""real thang!"" When ZZ Top first started becoming popular I was playing in the Memphis tennessee club circuit and the word was getting around about this little blues band from Texas that had been gigging in the area which featured a really hot lead guitarist. When i saw them at the Memphis Coliseum I found out what people were talking about. That's the reputation that they had at the time........hot and funky texas blues. I'm glad this CD was released because it is a good picture of where the band seemed to be heading in the early days. The CD is worth the price paid just for the first three songs alone. Billy Gibbons can play the blues! Nuff said!"
1,'80s remixes - NOT the originals!,"This is a compilation of tracks from ZZ Top's first 7 albums. BEWARE! These are the REMIXED versions with added reverb, etc. that first appeared in the '80s. They are NOT the ""Original LP Versions"" as claimed in the track list. Listen to the track samples to confirm this."
4,Comfy and sturdy,"I have had these for a month now and love them. I inserted an arch support and also an absorber too and had plenty of room, with or without these additions. I work from home and so wear them all the time and they are comfortable and sturdy."
4,If the shoe fits,"Couldn't find these locally. Had several pairs but my daughter's dog managed to chew them up. When he chews these up, I will order another pair."
5,Wonderful Read,"I purchased this book for the beautiful ones that are not yet born.... This fable is so unique and the book is a keepsake. I fell in love with Toussaint's excellent storytelling ability and the simplicity of a childhood lessons learned. Mom always said ""don't tease other children"". If you didn't believe her, you'll be convinced once you read this book. I can't wait for the series."
2,ordinary,This is not the type of diabetic cook book I was looking for. This book is a bunch of recipes from someone who may or may not have started eating healthy due to diabetes. I am not even sure they are healthy recipes. Certainly not what I was looking for
2,Better than nothing,"I eat a lot of from scratch food, usually on a vegetarian tilt. I bought this book for myself and my recently diagnosed daughter. To be honest, most of the recipes aren't something I see myself eating. It isn't what I eat, (salads, lean meats) but the quantities that I eat that cause me problems.For someone who has little idea of how or what to cook, this would be helpful. For someone who has cooked healthy for years, it is redundant and ugly."
3,high-carb/low-fat,"There seems to be two camps developing in the type 2comunity, those who follow the traditional ADA high-carband low-fat way-of-life and those who follow thelow-carb, higher protein/fat way. This book is in thehigh-carb group. Since I'm keeping my BG's 2hrs postmeal near the pre-meal targets (<120), the meals heredid not help me. Your milage may vary."
5,Easy Recipes!,Two of my best friends are diabetics! We often eat our meals together and I was having a tough time trying to find a good recipe that I could use and yet have the food taste good! I love this book....it is so easy to use. Anyone that does not want to fuss....should buy this book! I think it is wonderful!
5,For non-diabetics too,"These no-fuss recipes are great for ANYONE! You don't have to have diabetes to try these great tasting recipes. And it was such a pleasure to have easy to prepare recipes with amounts to serve one or two people-what a great way to try out a recipe! It is much simpler to double up or increase the serving size of recipes than to divide or reduce a recipe. I think this book should be re-titled to ""No-fuss Recipes for One or Two"""
3,Difficult on Kindle,Recipes look good but are hard to return to using the Kindle version. I will purchase the printed edition. Sorry I didn't in the first place.
5,"Don't Start This Late At Night, You'll Never Put It Down","This book is one of the best. A real page turner. Impossible to put down. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I don't usually read P.I. mysteries. Plot driver, centered in Orange County, California, it is superb! Don't miss this one!"
2,"Great concept, poor execution","Based on the description I really, really wanted to like this movie. But as hard as I tried, I just couldn't. Too much of the one-on-one female conversation was even more shallow than what I would expect from coed BYU freshmen.In addition to shallow characters, the script was just unbelievable at times and the direction was sorely acting.In a few scenes each of the three central characters really shine, but the interaction between the two primary characters just defies belief at times. By the end of the movie I was doubting those characters could convincingly order a fast food meal.Thankfully I rented the movie through a subscription service. Had I paid for this movie, I would have regretted the waste of money."
5,Cigar Funk Killer,"It is very concentrated. It does a wonderful job of killing the 'morning after cigar funk'. With average use a bottle will last for several months, so don't let the price scare you. You will spend more over time using one of the other 'swill in a big plastic jug' brands of mouthwash."
4,sweet,"This sweet story has lots going for it. Ms. Hill creates a wonderful setting for a romance that is lighthearted and fun to read. Pat was a really vivid character who made me smile and the other characters were also well done. I'm not crazy about romances where these minor players tell the main characters what to think, and that happens maybe a bit too often in this story. The love scenes were pleasant but if you're looking for a more erotic kind of story this may not be for you. It's real pleasure is in the gentle tease of the romance."
4,Liked it a lot.,"I read this book last week and once I started it, I didn't put it down till it was finished. I loved the characters and the way they interacted with each other. The author did a very nice job making their relationship 3 dimensional... What was also nice was both characters knew they were gay, this wasn't a ""coming out"" story. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking for a good story that's easy to follow."
4,Funny and not too predictable,"Once I started, I couldn't put it down.The romance between the two kind of evolves, rather than hopping into bed by chapter three. I like that."
4,Good CP,This filter is a more subtle and somewhat more difficult to use filter. The filter will produce good results after you get used to it.
4,Good Poster Children Sampler,"This has some great songs, and because it's an EP it doesn't drag itself into the normal Poster Children trap of being monotonous as the record goes along. If you are interested in hearing them, pick this up."
4,My girls like these!,"This is fun for my 4.5 and 6.5 year old girls. They are excited because they really want to learn how to sew and this is as close as they're going to get for a while with me as their mom.They are half-way done and their interest is lessening, but I'd still recommend for other kids who are interested in learning needlepoint or sewing. I recommend getting rid of the box because it probably won't turn out as perfect as the box picture. (I think it is cute when it's a little less neat and it is clearly done by a child, but they have compared and are disappointed theirs isn't flawless.)"
4,Great item,"The item is recommended for 6+, and I gave this to an 8yo and 11yo. They both were able to work on it by themselves, and enjoyed it immensely. I would probably not give it to any younger kids, unless they have had experience with this sort of thing. Definitely recommend it. Gives them something to DO, not just watch."
3,Too hard for my 4 year old,"My daughter is not skilled enough for this sewing game. Basically the kit contains yarn and 1 board to ""sew"" but its not for a 4 year old. Maybe better for a 6 year old is my guess."
4,cute toy,"looks cute. got this for a christmas gift for my niece. She wanted sewing crafts, so I think she will really like it."
4,great for beginners,purchased this as a gift for my 5 year old and she was able to catch on pretty quickly; overall this is a great beginner piece and I am sure we will be purchasing more like it soon. On a side note make sure to keep it away from the cat as ours got hold and unraveled it all.
2,Age 5+? Not with these inaccurate & useless instructions.,"Got this for my intelligent 6.5-year-old. If she had simply followed the instructions she would have run out of yarn long before she finished the project. The instructions say to go straight across each row, changing colors as needed to follow the pattern. This method requires much more yarn because so much gets wasted in an endless succession of knots on the back. Unless you know how to do needlepoint and can guide your child in this project, don't buy this."
3,Typical Pooh Book,"The lift-the-flap aspect of the book nicely keeps toddlers involved in reading. The rhyming text flows nicely as well. The book does start a bit oddly and jerks you into the story, but that's more of an adult complaint: the kids don't seem to mind."
1,"nice looking, but wrong...","While I admire the effort and thought this book took to put together, I wish that the authors had sought actual, impartial microbiology porfessionals to review it. The authors have got some things backwards, most notably what pH means, and they misrepresent what actually happens in soil when various chemicals and additives are incorporated. If you would be ""green,"" in print, it would be in everyone's best interest if you were green without adding to the pile of misinformation that so many spout without doing any research.I cannot recommend this book if you want to know what really goes on under your garden, if you want to trust statements and ""facts"" without having to corroborate them elsewhere."
1,Does not work,"device light comes up for at most 3 seconds and then dies. Documentation minimal. Website troubleshooting info practically non existent. Only recourse is to email the company and pray that they email you back with an answer at their convenience. There is a live chat available on their website, but only for other zoom products. I should have paid more and gone with a brand name."
1,Cheap Appearance & Poor Customer Service,"The ring is much cheaper than it appears in the photograph. One of the small diamonds was missing from the ring, so I returned it. Eves Addiction refunded the purchase price and the return postage. I requested refund of the initial shipping postage, but they haven't responded in over a week. The ring is cheap, the customer service is poor. Buy something else from another seller."
5,Wonderful Book!!!,"This is a book that Christians of all walks of life need. I am not a Christian counselor (yet), but I have used this book on several occasions. It provides a concise list of Scripture on a variety of subjects. I highly recommend it to anyone who believes the Word of God is applicable to life as we are living it today!"
5,Super,"Handy, superb quick reference to the super passages, Ideal for any counselor. Even excellent for those just to study deeper into the Bible"
4,Very handy to have around.,"I had to buy this book as a student at Word of Life for the summer camp program. Since then, I've used it numerous times, counselling students with suicide & other family/personal problems."
4,love the book,"I loved this book how it's quick, and easy to find the chapter and verse to that question you have been thinking about. I have a couple of different books from this author. this isn't my favorite book because in the other books he wrote down what the verse actually said, not just the bible reference. which is good because it's faster than finding it in the book, then taking 5 minutes more to find it in the bible. that's why i didn't give a 5 stars. because it's slower to find the verse your looking for."
1,Avoid!,"The eight Herman & Henry cartoons are amusing, but of poor video quality, which is bad enough. The rest of the disk is padded with wretched ""Mr. Piper"" fairy tales, with the worst sort of animation (either the eyes move, or the mouth moves, or the legs move... but not all at once). Don't bother."
4,eSATA,"connected an 8 TB raid-0s to this controller for streaming videos on my network. worked great out of the box, even in UBUNTU."
1,Work some time,"I bought this card for my computer because I have FreeAgent Pro 500GB. It works sometime, and sometime it does not. I have to disconnect and reconnect the cable for the computer to see the drive. The FreeAgent Pro software does not see the serial number, and the software does not wants to function.I ended up buy the Norco PCI-X card. The Norco card works as I expected."
5,Scientifically intriguing,"I read this book looking for escapism sci-fi, and instead found a book grounded in science FACT and having a great plot to boot.I consulted with several geoscientists and seismic experts, and they consider the book to be useful in teaching seismic theory, even though the actual prediction concepts may not be provable.Overall, an excellent read - I would like to find more books as good as this."
2,Arthur C. who??,"At least Mr Clarke is honest enough to admit thatthis book is (the late) Mike McQuay's work basedon an 850-word movie outline penned by A.C.C., towhich it bears only a passing resemblance.Mr McQuay apparently forgot that GOOD sciencefiction should still be plausible. Earthquakespredicted to the hour and minute? I don't thinkso Mike! Asian candidate for the US Presidencywith a very hard to hide secret? Nope again.Plus we get a collection of stereo-typically crazyIslamics to 'spice' this patchy plot up and some1960's style nuclear fallout 'drama' as well.And that ending - sheesh!!A dissapointing mish-mash that really shouldn'thave Clarke's name on it at all - and certainlynot in big letters above the title.Rated 3 (add 1 or 2 if you're undemanding)"
1,Completely trivial,"It seemed like a chore to finish this book. I cared about none of the characters or the situations they were in (the racial stereotypes were especially bothersome), and the earthquakes themselves (and the damage they created) were pretty ridiculous. Sorry folks, one earthquake will not send an entire state into the ocean. And being able to predict exactly how a building will collapse, and exactly what damage will happen where (let alone being able to predict earthquakes to that degree of accuracy) is impossible not only currently, but probably forever.Save your money!"
2,Not one of Clarke's best,"This book was based on an 850 page outline by Arthur C. Clarke. He farmed it out to another writer becuase of his limited knowlege and experience on California. Well, Clarke should have had a few lunches with Cal-Tech seismologists . He would have learned all he needed to know about California seismology and did a much better job himself. While writer Mike McQuay does have some interesting ideas on future socio/economic/techological developments, his ignorance of California seismology damages the quality of this work."
1,Awful,"sometimes i don't know why i even try to read arthur clarke. His books are boring, boring, boring. This one is no exception. He tends to write in vaguest terms possible and offers no excitement whatsoever. Avoid at all costs."
1,Abolutely one of the worst ever,"I only wish there were a negative symbol on the rating scale for this book. It strays from infantile political ravings (the world turns Islamic and the deep South becomes an Islamic state), psuedo-futuristic events that seem totally implausible and absolutely outlandish and unbelievable characters. Once again, the authors are at their worst when at their most intimate. Characters (who are they?) seem to appear, disappear without any rhyme or reason and the political events are so unreal as to be laughable. American keeping all minorities in ghetto by law by 2005? In 2030, white American will be 30% of the population? Chinese will take over and we will know and accept it calmly voting for ""Yo-Yu"" (I kid you not) or Li Chiang corporation/ticket. It seems even the authors were embarassed and tried to retrack some of their earlier statements towards the end.This is the worst piece of trash I have ever read"
2,hated it,"I was encouraged by the source (author) of the book but was very unhappy with the result. It terrorized the reader and dragged him through trials and tragedy throughout the book. Not in the slightest bit uplifting, in fact frequently angering. I'm afraid I would not recomend this book to anyone and in fact would discourage it."
3,Why are some of you reading Si-Fi???,"I have read A.C.C. novel and must agree that it is mediocre. However I don't understand why some of you are reading si-fi. To say that the idea of predicting earthquakes is ""implausible"" is ridiculous regarding si-fi. Traveling to other galaxies is not possible, and I have yet to see a dinosaur at the local zoo. Yet we still read and watch movies about it. Coming up with new ideas and thories about our world is the whole point of science fiction, so come on get over it!"
1,"Barely Clarke, Just a Touch of Science","If you're looking for Arthur C. Clarke's work, DON'T read this one! He apparently wrote the preface and closing notes, and germinated the original idea, but the rest is someone else. As for the ""science"" which he lauds in both preface and notes, I've seen more accurate renditions of seismology and planetary physics in The National Enquirer! Predicting not just an earthquake, but the place, date, and time of EVERY major earthquake on Earth years ahead of time is truly a fairy-tale."
3,Science With a Bit of Fiction,"When reading this book, the only time I put it down for more than a moment or two was to sleep. When I woke up I could not stay away from it. I wish that my science books would have been as fun a read. Give me a little fiction with my science, and I would be a genius. I regret not reading Clarke sooner.I read the book at a weird time. The dustcover mentions Chinese dominance in the world technology market. The day I started reading the book, a Chinese company just bought IBM out of its computer division. The goose bumps went down my arms. How does Clarke do it, or was it McQuay that looked into the crystal ball? It was spooky reading it.Some of the characters seem to be Clarke staples, and their relationships are almost predictable to the Clarke fan. The few surprises are worth it however.Over all an enjoyable read."
4,"Not Clarke, but not bad, either","Clarke fans may be upset to learn that he did not write this book, but come on -- the man is about 500 years old and still cranking out good ideas for stories. If you like ""mad scientist"" stories, then this is definitely one to add to your collection. Although it deals with an area of science that doesn't captivate me (seismology) I enjoyed the fast pace and the strangeness of McQuay's near-future America."
2,Don't be fooled,"I thought this was going to be another excellent piece of RATM concert footage, but it's flat out, an interview with people like you and me who like the band. Don't be fooled, this video has no LIVE FOOTAGE what so ever."
1,Do you like Rage Against the Machine?,"It's only a documentary, people talking about them and nothing else, there's no music. Son think before do anything in only you like the music."
3,Somewhat Informative,"Unauthorized documentary has fans and friends of the band explaining RATM's history and message. A rather tepid film, with NO RATM music (instead they just play some insidously generic guitar riffs in the background) and (this is the biggie) NO RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE (save a few still photos and one brief interview with Tom Morrello). However, fans will want to check it out for the insight on Zack and Tom's pre-RATM days (even though they dont spend much time talking about it)."
1,Save Your Money,Dude as an avid Rage fan I thought this would be a good addition to my collection.. i was surely mistaken. NO music. No Band Members.Its people talking about the music and not even cool people. Save your money please do it for the kids
3,"Lovesexy or The Black Album? The Black Album, hands down","LOVESEXY, Prince's actual 1987 Warner Bros. release. THE BLACK ALBUM Prince's 1987 bootleg release. If you want the rock of PURPLE RAIN with a trip, LOVESEXY's your bet. If you like it somewhat funky, THE BLACK ALBUM is your bet.Both albums feature ""When 2 R In Love"" but THE BLACK ALBUM has got PRINCE more stranger than ever. Not only funky but dance tracks. ""Le Grind"" and ""Cindy C."" kick off this party. ""Rock Hard In A Funky Place"" ends the party on a good note. It's a short party but well worth it. I don't want to give away the other 4 tracks.The vinyl of THE BLACK ALBUM came out in 1987 while the Warner Bros. official release came in 1994 on CD (now out of print) while Prince was trying any way he could to exhaust ties with Warners, or else this once hidden gem would still be hiding."
4,LoveSexy pt 1,"After some masterpiece like Sign O The Times no artist can make no record good enough. Ok. I guess this is what leads to some inner question: new or repetition? Prince answer is Lovesexy. But meanwhile the doubt Black Album was worn.Not a great album in fact but have 3 great songs every Prince's fan should hear: ""Le Grind"", ""Bob George"" and the best track: ""Cindy C""."
2,Not his best but acceptable...,"The Black Album by Prince was somewaha of a dub because obviously you can tell that most of the outtakes are WIP's[work in progress].There's also the story wher ehe had a ""trip"" on ecstasy 7 days before the album was due to hit, but instead he came back with Lovesexy.Now this album in itself it kind of odd to listen to because the voice changes and sped up voices are obviously Prince, Cat, and Sheila.Throughout the album you notice each and everyone.So in conclusion, it was right for Prince to keep this album locked in his vaults because it would literally be a waste of vinyl to listen to this.Bob George is quite disturbing but it isn't as bad as everyone claims it is.Most of the album is uptempo, Cindy C is a standout track..."
3,Legendary but underwhelming bootleg,"The history of this album is well-documented, but in a nutshell (for those not in the know), Prince wrote and recorded it for Sheila E.'s birthday one night, and eventually decided not to release it due to religious reasons. The acetate got out, however, and the rest is history. This version is the Warner Brothers 1994 re-issue, and it contains no liner notes. The songs are merely listed on the disc itself.It's unfortunate that the hype machine got ahold of this album before it could be properly reviewed. It contains exactly HALF an album worth of good material, and the rest is experimental at best.The gems? ""2 Nigs United For West Compton""; a funk/fusion classic that probably belonged in a live set somewhere. ""Rock Hard In A Funky Place"", a low-key funkfest that's similar to ""Housequake"", but way more minimalistic. ""Superfunkicalifragisexy"", a rave-up that surely belonged on ""Parade""."
2,Average&Highly Overrated,"I remember back in late 1987 when this Album was mentioned as being Prince's Strong Return To his Funk Roots&it was gonna be uncut&raw.well after getting my copy at that time I thought it was Jamming.but as years passed by this Album felt more like a Cool Myth as to being a Important Album.aside from ""Superfunkycalifragisexy"" I don't care much for the rest of this Album.it's cool Loose Playing Jammning but as far as a Album it doesn't do much for me.but it did wonders for Prince as a Prolific Artist&opened up a whole new area of His Productivity.but ..."
4,Amazon selling Bootlegs? Pricne is gonna be mad!,"The item in the photo ""erotic city records"" IS a bootleg. It is not from over seas or a limited pressing that was leaked it is a fair at best quality illegal bootleg copy. I am not sure if that is all that is being sold but if so shame shame shame. it is a fonky album but you will be happier with the REAL one that was released in 1994. track that down."
3,For completists only,"The reason he put it out was because it was leaked out when he was at his commercial peak, and wanted to put an end to the low grade bootlegs people were spending a lot of money on. The original copy (if you can find them) is still a highly valued collectors item. It was also towards the end of his contract with Warners and figured he might as well put this out. He did no promotion for it, although he had done a couple of the songs live.It's a fun, loose jam session that ties in to ""Sign O' The Times"" and ""Lovesexy"" (""When 2 R in Love"" was the only one that wound up being released from here). It is good, but not great, and if you're going to buy it because you're either getting into his music, or have everything else he's put out, this would be one of the last to get.""Crystal Ball"" also has a lot of material from this era."
2,I see why he held onto this one,"I gotta say I love MOST of Prince's music. When the Black album was circulating ""underground"" it was a MUST-HAVE for any die-hard fan. When I obtained a tape of it (remember TAPES?) I was enraptured when i heard it. When he released the recording years later, I bought a legitimate copy and to tell you the truth, it wasn't that great. 3 songs are good, ""Cindy C"", ""LeGrind"", and ""When 2 are in Love"" which, of course showed up later on the hastily put together ""Lovesexy"" album.Do yourself a favor, borrow a copy from a friend and burn the only 2 good songs on it that you can't get anywhere else."
4,An interesting recording in Prince's catalog.!,"The mystique surrounding this album is, at least in my opinion, somewhat elevated. That being said, I cannot stress enough that this album contains some very, very unique songs. ""Bob George"" comes to mind, specifically for the voice Prince utilizes throughout the song. Yet, ""Superfunkycalifragisexy"" ""When 2 R In Love"" ""Cindy C."" and ""Dead On It"" are fantastic songs as well, meriting this album its four stars. It would be ideal to purchase the album Lovesexy as well, in order to contrast the different sounds and tone of these interconnected albums."
3,feedback,Suddenly this album was possible to order from Amazon. I lokkes forward listen to it. But i had to admit this is not the kind of <Prince> i like
4,"I had a good time with this story,","I love stories like THORN by Frederick A. Babb. I was given this book by a friend for Christmas and I was happy about that because I am such a romance freak, anyway, I like this writer and I loved his story. I will order his first book and hope the story will be as good as THORN was...I'm sure it will be."
2,One Man's Fantasy,"This book seems a little too fantastical for me. But maybe it's the author's fantasy being fulfilled via print. Hopefully, with growth, Mr. Babb will become the author the limited number of fans here think he is. Sorry, but that's my opinion."
3,"Fair for a second book,",Thorn is the second book by this writer I have read. I think this writer has a way to go before he can be taken seriously as a bestselling author however. I've noticed how he enjoys tooting his own horn on some of the stupid gossip boards on other sites. If nothing else Mr. Babbs is humorous !!
5,I enjoyed this one,I like looking for new authors because the established one seem to get into a predicable rut as they start to churn out story after story. One of my friends recommended this author so I bought the book. I am glad that I did because I really did enjoy this breath of fresh air in the romance novels (which are my favorite anyway). The book was well told and the story line something new for me. I recommend anyone looking for new voices in romance to check this one out.
1,A real waste of time,"I enjoy reading about the old west and the C.War period. I thought I might enjoy this film. I was wrong.I think my main beef is that this film tries to tell a modern story and spice it up by telling it in historic context. The problem is that our modern stories are hard to imagine having taken place back then. Our world and theirs are completely different.Aside from this issue, I thought the film was just dumb, poorly acted, and un-entertaining."
4,If only it followed the originals ending.,"I've never seen the original but I've read about it. Dan Evans survives in the end. I would have loved to see this ending in the movie but alas, he doesn't."
2,Wrong region,"Would be great if we could play on our DVD player, comes up as wrong region, beware purchasing US DVD's from Aus."
5,3:10 to Yuma,"A rancher struggles to support his ranch and family during a long drought. Desperately needing money to build a well, he takes an assignment to transport a notorious felon, in the hands of authorities, to Yuma for imprisonment. But, once the two meet, the criminal tries to tempt him with--in exchange for allowing him to escape--an offer of much more money than the rancher ever expected, the result of a hidden loot. A sturdy and enjoyable remake that was extremely well-acted and well-directed."
1,"Wanted to love it ,but had to leave it....","I purchased the DVD with great expectation. After ""Unforgiven"", ""Open Range"" and even ""The Missing"", I was excited for another great ""new age"" western. Well, it's not.When you have this much acting talent in a film and the cohesiveness of the story, let alone obvious, stupid blunders, that pretty much insult your intelligence, continue to make your mind twist with the actors'(and directors') EGOS, I finally did what Crowe did to Fonda in this film. I threw if off a cliff! If viewing a film was torture, this would be ""water boarding""!Oh, by the way. Standing at the bottom of the cliff I threw the film from was my friend, who just LOVED ""Heavens Gate""."
1,Waste of a couple of hours...,"Plenty of action, admirable story line, but in the end, lots of what everyone did in the movie didn't make any sense...unsatisfying ending to say the least. Wasted a couple of hours watching this useless movie."
3,Ben Foster as Charlie Prince,"I'd rate the Blu-Ray DVD 3 stars, 1 for Cinematography, 1 for great Blu-Ray transfer, (both picture and Audio) and 1 star for Ben Foster as Charlie Prince (best actor in the film), Russell Crowe's bad sidekick.The film falls apart with most unbelievable climax, who wrote this bad script?Of recent westerns two stand out, ""The Proposition"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford""."
3,Hard to say...,"On the one hand, I know what I like and I liked this movie. On the other hand, it's pretty deeply flawed. The characterizations of the two leading men were so lopsided that it kind of got to me. Russell Crowe's character is too much like Superman and Bale's is too much like Clark Kent to like their interaction. I kept waiting and waiting for Bale's character to shine and even his final moment of glory is robbed of its luster because of this odd misplacement of charisma.Oh well, at the end of the day, I generally like it, so I can give it a recommendation, but maybe just as a rental."
2,Mindless entertainment,"The plot is contrived, weak and unbelievable. Many scenes where the actors lower their voices and mumble. Acting is ok, but not great. There are some good supporting actors doing a fine job of creating bad guy characters."
2,3:10 to Failure,Thank God they can't erase the original movie from my mind with this one.A very poor attempt to duplicate a TRUE WESTERN CLASSIC ! They butchered the original story line and added way too much garb. This will make you want to see the original with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin and appreciate it even more.I had HIGH HOPES for this movie when I heard it was coming out. Too much HOLLYWOOD BS ruined this classic for the remake. The original classical music was missing as well. I will not be adding this to my western collection.
3,"Great Blu Ray title, but not a western classic.","I too was lured in by the comparison to Unforgiven. While you have two fine actors here I was not impressed with the way the characters were developed over the course of the film. In retrospect, I do not feel I ever really had the desire to connect with the outlaw Ben Wade(Russell Crowe) at all, and would have been more than satisfied with his ultimate demise. You were not given any hint of the ranchers true painful history until the end of the film, and then he dies. The saving grace for me was the chance to put my Christmas theater system to the test with a 1080p resolution and 7.1 surround. That experience alone was worth the purchase. Sweet!!!!!!!"
4,Great Movie,Two of my favorite actors in a not-so-favorite genre and I loved it. Now I just need to see the original.
4,3:10 To Yuma,"All in all a pretty good Movie. A hell of a lot of shootem up stuff but thats what oaters are supposed to have. Some of the happenings sort of stretch the imagination. I do think the earlier one with Glen Ford, 1957 release was a better film."
2,WTF?,"WTF? That's what you're going to say at the end of what could of been a 4 or maybe even a 5 star movie. The ending absolutely ruins it. I didn't see the original so I don't know if the ending is the same, but I was very disappointed."
1,"great acting, horrible plot, story and sequencing, very boring, no Tombstone!","movie never gets going. even the last shoot out, which I was hoping would redeem the horrible story was very poorly directed. SPOILER: How long does christian bale stand with his back to the gun fight before getting shot? Ridiculous, who would do that? Crowe and Bale put on great performances, movie was just horrible though."
