1,Not much there.,"I'm not sure whether the author's purpose in writing this text book was to create a text on time series analysis or a manual for R users, but whichever it was, he didn't succeed. This is a very slim text (especially considering how much it costs), only 139 pages in total, and not surprisingly, there's just not that much in it. Pfaff covers a reasonably large range of topics, including stationary ARMA processes, cointegration, unit root tests, etc, but only a few pages are devoted to each topic and no worked examples are provided to assist the reader's understanding (exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, but no solutions are given). As the title suggests, some R code is given to implement various techniques that are described throughout this book, but this is never annotated and you would be better off looking at one of the various R tutorials that can be obtained for free on the internet."
3,"Beautiful, BUT....","I bought this set about a year ago. Within a week or so I had a chip on a plate and I do not have any idea how it got there. I am very careful with my dishes and wash by hand, no kids.... I also noticed scratchmarks on the plates right away from the knives. While I do love the looks of this set, I would not buy it again nor would I really recommend it to anyone else."
1,Pfaltzgraff Evening Sun,Pfatzgraff dishes have suffered a decline in quality since moving production to China. These dishes began chipping & breaking right out of the box. My husband recently heated a plate of food in the microwave & the dish split right down the middle. We then decided to check other dishes in the cabinet & found another dish cracked down the middle & it split right in his hand. I had contacted Customer Service when these dishes were less than 6 months old & they told me I was past the return period & there was nothing they could do. I emailed the president & complained of their now inferior product & got the same form letter . They are not willing to stand behind their product.I have had Pfaltzgraff dishes in the past when they were USA made & did not have this problem. These are the worst dishes I have ever had & will not buy Pfaltzgraff products again.
1,Really Disappointed,"These dishes were absolutely beautiful yet disappointing. The edges began to chip soon after I bought them. I have thrown out most of the mugs. There are currently two adults in my household who use these dishes daily. I have had several sets of dishes in the 36 years I have been married. Those dishes were used by two children and guests. The other sets held up for years; Mikasa, Johnson Brothers, Fiestasware. I did not write my review immediately because I seldom write reviews. Since I could not afford to right away, I am now trying to replace this set with Fiestaware. This prompted me to write the review. I bought these Pfaltzgraff dishes because they are beautiful and I respected the brand name."
5,Brilliant!! Way ahead of it's time.,"This is a great concept album. I had no idea that Vangelis was the composer of this work before I purchased it. The track ""The Four Horsemen"" is one of my favorite songs ever. The whole CD is played with so much feeling. A true masterpeice. The fact that it was released in 1971 baffles me from the sound quality to the ambient tracks and the techno rock guitar riffs.Truly you could play some of these tracks to someone not familiar with Aphrodite's Child and tell them it was from the 1990's and they would believe you. 666 is a two disc set. I like disc one better than two, probably because of the track ""infinity"" on disc two actually labeled with the infinity symbol. I could do without it, it goes on forever on purpose I'm sure. I get it. I just don't like the track at all. Other than that it is a brilliant start to finish."
1,Beware of CD buying on Amazon,"Apparently purchasing CDs from Amazon lines you up for memberships (at cost !) for Simply Audiobooks and Emusic. I got smacked with over $70 in charges and traced it back to my purchase of this CD. Nothing wrong with the CD or the delivery, etc. WATCH OUT FOR WACKY CHARGES ON YOUR CREDIT CARD WHEN PURCHASING CDs (and anything else from Amazon. What a RIP OFF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,greek rock trio? group doin concept lp w/ 4 HORSEMEN..,"haven't heard the entire lp like just the ""beast"" titled tracs and some short intros but THE BEST 'SONGS' I KNOW R: THE 4HORSEMEN, DO IT, BABYLON, AEGIAN SEA, BREAK, (then) the lamb, the 7th seal, loud...,here & now."
2,"Bloat, Bloat onnnnn...","Many people over the years have said that prog-rock is a bloated, overwrought thing. One good piece of ammo in support of that argument is this very album by Vangelis, Demis Roussos, et al from around 1970 or so. A pompous, windbag of a record that takes a lot of its (mis)cues from the Book of Revelations, this demonstrates how a lot of prog bands could easily confuse deep meaning and mysticism for incoherence and druggy confuse-ology. There's only a few things I can say in defense of this work: 1) it's Aphrodite's Child's last album. 2) Demis Roussos actually went on to do disco music that was even worse than this. And 3), it's so overwrought and bad that it's funny, sort of like an Ed Wood movie. Ergo, 2 stars instead of a mere one because of these barely-redeeming elements. But I will say that if you're not neck-deep into prog-rock, this probably is something you'll find tremendously off-putting. I know I did."
1,let the negativity begin,"For prog-rock-philes only. Save your money.A bad attempt at ""concept record"".Do you want my copy? I wouldn't knock it if I didn't actually have it.I don't think a ""mint copy"" of this record would command a big price.I know a mint copy of the cd won't.Ever."
1,Not Progress,"The last track, ""Break"", had potential, butI don't recommend buying this expensive CD for that one tune.I wouldn't call this album ""progressive rock"", because by 1971, rock had already progressed much further than this.Here's my recipe for progressive rock :Step one - write legitimate songs on the level of The Beatles, either vocal tunes or instrumentals.Step two - construct elaborate arrangements for those tunes utilizing highly advanced classical and jazz technology.If you can't do step one, don't bother with step two."
4,Works well as long as you use their software,"On my Win XP SP2 Dell Inspiron 2650 USB 1.1, I found that I could not use the XP ""Writeable Directory"" built-in ability. But I installed and used the Oak Technology SimpliCD utility that came on the CD rom with the drive, and it works fine with that utility. So if you are buying this in the aftermarket, make sure they send you the CD that came with the prouct originally."
3,loader,this thing doesnt have tbswitch basicly means the loader is constantly spining and its loud as hell. it works well and gets the job done on my vs1 but i would definitly get a halo or eggy
4,great study reference,"This dvd is a great study reference of the wooden dummy. It is not, however, taught in the same manner as the school which I attend. With all that said, These dvds never let me down and I strongly recommend them as a strict study reference."
5,Worth a trip to the Unknown Island,"Jose Saramago's wisdom wrapped in a small book reveals far more than a simple tale. His writing in The Tale of the Unknown Island, like in his bold Blindness, is a paradox addressing issues that confront us all. In this short story are provocative truths filling the pages and surrounding the unknown until the isand becomes familiar...or at least worth visiting. It's a quick read, but an unforgetable story."
3,Disappointed,"To tell you the truth, I didn't like the book! I don't know if its me or the book. But the book at the end suddenly changes its course to a very different angle. At the end, you will be lost. Why am I saying at the end? The book is only 64 pages!There's something appealing in this story, which attracted me (don't know what it is!)... But I was disappointed to the way the writer ended his book."
3,A Tiny Fable,"A tiny book; 51 tiny pages with illustrations. A fable to be read at one sitting. Boy meets girl. Boy chases girl. Pursue your dreams despite obstacles. I wonder if this Nobel Laureate author wrote this work to compete with his linguistic countryman, Paulo Coelho, who is a megaseller of simple allegorical tales. (Saramago is Portuguese; Coelho is Brazilian.) The search for the unknown island has particular resonance for a Portuguese author whose ancestors were responsible for the European discovery of half of the world. ""Are there any unknown islands left?"" is a theme of the book."
2,Meanders before completely petering out,"A short fable by Portuguese writer Jose Saramango (it could hardly be called a novel at a scant 51 pages... with illustrations) that starts strongly, but meanders, becomes less interesting, and then finally peters out before the big ""revelation"" of The Unknown Island. I like the tone, the flavor of this harkens-back-to-olden-times-of-storytelling piece, but the author's run-on sentences and paragraphs, his dialogue that is smooshed into the narrative action, just becomes tiring and not as effective a stylistic device as I think he intended. The drawings by Peter Sis are not nearly as inspired or as evocative as the ones he did for Dominguez's ""The House of Paper,"" which adds to the disappointment I had with this book. Short, but definitely not sweet."
5,don't miss the point!,"To understand this perfect gem one must remember that J.S is a life lone Marxist/Anti-Capitalist. In light of the failiar of the masses to prosue a just society, what alternatives are there for the rare individual prosuer? The unknown island is the Just Society at first at last a Just Love. Both would be beautiful. J.S. represents the losers and his beauty is revenge against the uglyness of the winners. I would love emails with any other interpetation."
3,to remember old times.,"I liked the box, it's not too thick, and every disc has an envelope.So mostly it's ok, but as it doesn't have captions or subtitles I don't get all the dialogue."
4,Renegade Finds Its Way -- combining action and adventure,"Renegade overcomes the obvious limitations of Branscombe Richmond by featuring Lorenzo Lamas as eye candy with an ability to engage in nearly continuous action scenes, enduring beatings etc without a scar or a permanent injury from situations where most people would not even survive. Excellent pacing helps, and his relationships with the other major and minor characters all ring true, especial with Kathleen Kinmont."
5,Memories,This set brings back fond memories of when this series ran on TV. It is amazing how short the episodes are when you take out the advertisements. A one hour show is approx. 35 to 40 minutes long. It is a great series and being well enjoyed.
5,Satisfaction,I've ordered for Amazon numerous times now and service has always been great. I'm very happy with this product. I'll enjoy watching it.
5,Great Series!,"This was a great series, great martial arts scene, etc...it's probably the deal out there, for this price it includes the entire five years that the series ran vs. purchasing one year at a time...glad i bought this!"
4,Renegade: Great Show/Bad Packaging,"I have been a fan of this show since it first started airing in 93/94. I'm so happy to finally have the entire series on DVD. The quality isn't that great (especially on a big screen tv/blu ray player), but it's not so bad that you can't watch/enjoy it. My problem is with the packaging. It's like a huge VCR tape box and all 20 DVDs are in single sleeves. 1 disc to a sleeve, then they are put all together in the tape box. It's a really cheap way to package an entire series. But that's my only complaint. If you really liked Renegade when it was on, I highly recommend this set. And at $33 and free shipping, it's well worth it!"
4,Renegade: Complete Series,"Long awaited complete series on DVD. Good entertainment, especially if you are a Harley fan and also enjoy watching Lorenzo. I also enjoyed seeing all the famous stars taking part in `Cameo Parts` through out the seasons. Shame it was discontinued in `97. Bike still looks good even after all the years."
4,Very cute - my son loves it,I got this when my son was 7 months old. He really loved it right off of the bat. He gives him kisses and everything. Lots of smiles. I recommend it
4,Every child loves puppets...and parents,This puppet was a great addition to his toy box. It is well made and little kid loves it when they see it...FYI don't pull it out of your diaper bag and try playing with it because a little girl may think it's hers and take it from you at a restaurant. The only down side of this puppet is that it's not really made for big handed people like Dads.
3,"Capable, BUT","Used this for my Chrysler 2.7 motor. None of the discs cutters fit the upper rings. Had to take it to work and have a friend machine it down. Thought that if it had two cutting wheels, that ONE of them would fit a metric motor."
4,Good resource,Very good resource book for any student who is working on their dissertation or thesis now or in the future.
3,Useful guide,"There may not be much of any new information you will find in this book, but it does have some useful reminders. I cannot say it is a must have. It serves its purpose as an additional lighter resource for the writing process."
4,Thesis or Dissertation,I found the book to be an easy read and insightful. The book covers many aspects that one might over look when planning for and completing a thesis or dissertation. Great book it is the bible for writing a thesis or dissertation that can be incorporated into the department requirements.
4,Dissertation Book,This is an excellent book that was in very good condition. It is like new. I love it.
4,Engaging and Exiting!,"Having never read anything about Arthurian legend, I was hesitant to pick my first introduction to it. I feel that I chose wisely in Mary Stewart's trilogy. Her writing will draw you into the story, and each book assumes you have little to no knowledge from the previous books (which was great for me, it helped to hear some of it again). I just found myself wishing afterwards there could have been a little more romance! However, I guess these books were more about Merlin, not Arthur or Guinevere. Another confusing aspect is that some of the more familiar names have been changed, and some are repeated. Having no base knowlege of the legend this was slightly confusing for me. Anyway, these books are highly enjoyable and I would definitely recomend them."
4,Rebecca Shaw Turnham Malpas Series,I have enjoyed reading the entire Turnham Malpas series in sequence. I have also read Ms. Shaw's other books. All are a delightful not too strenuous read and provide a look at a different place and life in a small English village. I compare these books to Jan Karon's books about a very small town in North Carolina which are also favorites of mine.
1,Worst Music Ever!!!,"This looks like it should be cute and wonderful,but the episodes are way too short and disjointed. The worst part though is the soundtrack the intro song is so horrible that I can't stand to watch this dvd ever again!!! not too mention the fact that you have to hear it again every few minutes due to the short length of the episodes. Very Bad series!!!!"
2,"Pretty Pictures, Poor Projects","The historical information and pictures of classic furniture are useful and can serve as some inspiration when putting together your own 50s look. The projects in the book, however, seem like a lot of work for not a lot result, time consuming, perhaps more expensive than an equivalent purchase, and in one instance (a wall hanging from a CD sleeve) downright tacky. There are way better books on this subject (see, Pad)."
2,A dated little book,"Giving a house today a 1950's look is a dated idea. The cool thing now is creating your own look. What isn't cool or very creative is just sort of buying a lot of 1950's things and attempting to create that look instead of mixing things up. What we and our friends are doing is mixing all styles. I mean, like, we're not the Jetsons. This is 2002. Almost 2003."
2,Hairpin loom,"I was very excited to finally locate and be able to purchase a hairpin lace loom and try out one of the patterns in Kristin Omdahl's book. Unfortunately my hairpin loom arrived bent. It was shipped in a bubblemail envelope with no protection and I have not figured out how to straighten it out.I did contact the seller and my money was refunded but I still have a bent hairpin loom and no confidence in ordering another as it will likely be shipped the same way, in an envelope instead of a box."
4,Hairpin lace loom,"These are not as easy to find, but worth having . The afghans are very pretty and easy to make with this tool."
2,Only accurate within 1/2 pound,"Initially when I bought this scale, I saw that the weight on the package was 135.5 pounds, and I thought, ""Great! It measures in tenths of a pound."" When I got it home to test it out, I discovered by the next day that it was only measuring in increments of 1/2 pound. That may be fine for most people, but I am losing weight at the rate of 1/4 pound per day, and a scale that measures only 1/2 pound does not help me keep track of my weight. Nowhere on the package does it say that it only measures in increments of 1/2 pound (I bought this scale at Costco from a large display.) Amazon, to its credit, does say this in the description, in fact they are the only ones to mention it. Bravo for Amazon! I will be taking the scale back to Costco which is a shame, since I bought it there for less than $20 and it seemed like a good deal at the time."
1,This is NOT for Nokia 2600,I ordered it thinking it was a charger for my nokia 2600. But they sent me a charger for Nokia 6681 :-/ :-/
3,"Works, but not great.","I bought this for my Nokia candy-bar phone. The contact inside the phone receptacle wiggles a lot, sometimes not charging the phone if it's at the wrong angle."
5,Very god,"I've just had it for a week, but I've already become quite excited with it! I highly recommend it. I've been studying greek for 1.5 year, with medium grades, and this is just at the right level for me.Pär Lidén"
2,Mixed Blessing,"While the editors have greatly added to the ease of picking up more vocabulary than is learned in Mounce's course, there are two major drawbacks to this Greek New Testatment. First, is the use of a somewhat italic Greek font that results in some characters differing considerably from other Greek fonts. In particular are the characters for rho (which looks like an omicron with some form of subscript) and the kappa which looks like a lower case English ""x""). The second, and more critical drawback, is that this is a reverse engineered text based on the selections made by the NIV translation committee (per the editors description in the introduction).At least the latter of these should be made clear in the book's description and the editors should certainly consider a more standard font in future editions.It's not that I will pitch this volume out, it is that I wish it could have been better than it is."
3,"Great idea, but terrible font.","The font really is bad. Not so bad that you can't overcome it after spending some quality time reading it, but it is certainly bad. Why did the publisher insist on a barely-readable font for a reader's edition of the Greek New Testament? We may never know. I still use it every day due to it's portability and the extremely useful footnotes containing simple definitions of words occurring 30x or less. I would say skip this edition and go straight for the 2nd edition of the Reader's GNT, but the font in the 2nd edition may actually be worse! I would recommend going with the UBS Reader's Edition instead of either of these choices."
3,Good concept; terrible font,"I read the greek text for pleasure. I wanted to stretch myself and stop cheating with my interlinear, so I got this.Since I'm not doing serious scholarship, I wasn't bothered by the sub-optimal manuscript choices. But I WAS bothered by the italicized font. I ended up going back to my interlinear because the font somehow sucked the pleasure out of my reading.I think the concept is great; the footnotes are very helpful to keep you gliding along without flipping to a reference book all the time. I wish someone would make a similar volume with a graceful font and layout that would be a pleasure to read."
2,Grandmothers memories,I was very dissappointed as I got the impression that the book was going to be for ME to write in for my grandchildren!!!!! I did read it and was not impressed.
5,ABSURD!!! EXCELLENT!!!,"Well, it's OVERKILL!!! One of the best thrashing metal bands!! As I expected, a great show!!!"
4,Fascinating,"These DVD's are full interesting subjects, which includes excellent photos of our universe that most people have never seen. All four DVD's are interesting, but the first one is ""over the edge"", with Louie's excellent presentation. The second one includes fascinating information about the human body. The last two include trusting God, even during the hardest times of our lives. I think this is a great set."
5,Fantastic set,"Lou is an awesome speaker, taking that which is tanagable and relating it to our wonderous creator. Utilizing real life stories to share the love our saviour has for us. I'm glad I purchased all 4 DVD's together. I was truely blessed.I will pass this on to my church for small group studies, for more to be blessed."
5,Fabulous ability to communicate,"I became aware of Louis Giglio through the first two DVDs in this series ~~ Indescribable and How Great is our God! Gave them as presents to many people because of their great impact! Just saw the whole series and the last two, When Life Hurst the Most and FruitCake & Ice Cream, bring the truth in a most powerful way.Louie is one-of-a-kind!!!! Thank you God for him."
5,The Heart of Passion,"This Passion set includes Indescribible, How Great Is Our God, Hope: When Life Hurts Most, and Fruitcake & Icecream.I have only viewed the first two and look forward to seeing the other two. I love Louie's passion and was awe-struck at the picture of ""laminin."" Louie's presentation in both the DVD's that I viewed are indescrible and I would recommend this 4 DVD set for everyone, but especially for youth as he gives a thought-provoking presentation to counter the teaching of evolution."
5,Much more than I expected,"So far, I've watched ""Indescribable"" and ""How Great Is Our God"". Powerful. Life changing. God's fingerprints are everywhere and so is His great love for us. Worth viewing regularly to keep perspective in this nutty world."
4,Serves its purpose,I am type of person who enjoys sound quality but not inclined to spend more for high end audio components. This subwoofer provides the deep bass required for my 5 speaker system. The sound provided when watching movies is similar to the movie theatre experience.My computer audio library is linked to the entertainment sound system and I am less than enthused by the bass for this purpose. I enjoy rock music and feel as if the bass is more inclined to serve hip hop music. The tight clear sound from bass guitar is lost in deep reverberating bass.
4,shannon does it again..,"the erotic queen of her genre which is soft porn like movies, does it again in this. although its not a movie with big budget special effects, knock out powerful performances & thought provoking themes, it is another great performance by ms. tweed and she does her usual performance in this film, sexy & provoking. a great feast of eye candy for any shannon tweed fan."
2,not quite what i wanted,"honestly, i was looking for a book on how to do restorations on vintage barbie dolls, and this is just not the book for it! there is one small section in the very end of the book that tells how to do some hair makeovers, but that's it. it's more a book on ""famous"" artists that have done fashion doll makeovers and their stories. if you're looking for a tutorial on doll restoration, look online. you'll find more information there."
5,Hot Wheels are Hot....still !,As always Hot Wheels are still a crowd pleaser.....my sons loved them 30 years ago and now my grandsons are enjoying them...the toy spans generations and never goes out of style.
3,"I enjoyed it while I was reading, but. . . .","Several thousand years ago, after 'The Troubles', humanity reached another plateau and decided that war was not acceptable. As time passed, the only government 'forces' became a very small group of trained personnel and ships that were used for intervention against an occasional pirate. Into this empire came the Wyzhnyny, Seventh Swarm, invasion fleet. A race whose racial history demonstrated that their only chance of survival required the total destruction of any other race they came into contact with. Surrender is not an option, and if Humanity cannot embrace the idea of war or produce the millions of soldiers necessary, the Terran Commonwealth wouldn't even be a note in Wyzhnyny history. - Exciting future combat that keeps you turning the pages. The time sequencing is rather disorienting though, with months passing during space 'flights' while in a form of suspended animation, combined with 'instantaneous' communication."
3,An interesting voice in Military Sci-Fi,"Unlike many military sci-fi authors, Dalmas focuses not on the expierences of an individual soldier or the whys and wherefores of strategy and tactics but on the social pressures and changes that war causes. In this novel, we are introduced to many different characters from many different social strata and we see how the war and their responses to it changes their lives forever.Although this is certainly a fascinating way to deal with the subject of futuristic warfare, the multiple characters, storylines and climaxes led to a lack of focus that prevented me from getting really involved in the story. The plot developments defintely ring true but unfortunately this book does not rate as one of the best books in the military sci-fi genre."
4,Nice quality - beware dimensions are not accurate,"I purchased 2 of these for a narrow drawer. They are very nice beech wood, but they are 4"" wide, not 3 1/2"" as stated on Amazon. As a result, I could one use one of them and had to return one. I like the quality, I am just disappointed I can't fit 2 in a drawer. Actual dimensions are 17""l x 4""w x 1 13/16""h."
5,Beautiful design and nice quality,"Solid knife holder, fits perfectly in the kitchen drawer. I have a varied assortment of knives and was looking for a way to store them other than using the traditional on the counter wood block. This drawer block was the perfect answer."
5,Looking for cost cutting,"My son had to have this book for his class at college. the price at the bookstore was about 6X higher. Very happy with book, speed of mailing and savings..."
5,Only text book available in English!,"After a long and arduous search for a text book to teach philosophy (in the realist tradition) to high school teenagers, this is the best thing in English I have found. I strongly recommend it to teachers of Christian philosophy - who are bereft of suitable materials in the English language given the predominance of the analytical-positivistic tradition in these countries!!."
4,Coming of age of a Conservative movement,"A fascinating, full of facts William F. Buckley's ""Getting It Right"" is a must read for every young conservative. This story of a Republican Party's quest for its ideals is told as seen through the eyes of two young activists, who witnessed the foundation of and participated in two significant movements in American politics, the John Burch Society and Nathaniel Branden Institute. The book is filled with priceless facts of post-WWII America's political spectrum, masterfully delivered by Buckley from a fresh angle. Two-hundred-and-six-page-long, this novel covers a ten year period from 1955 to early 1965 and is informative as much as entertaining.A much recommended page-turner."
3,good but big!,"Seems like a pretty accurate scale, but when it arrived it was much larger than I'd expected -- difficult to fit in the space I had allotted for it. It would be helpful if the website listed dimensions!"
2,Guess your weight,"Looks good and all . . . but the accuracy is off by 5-8 lbs. I keep it in the corner of a hallway and every person that stands on it says ""NO WAY!"" I have not personally weighed myself at the docor's office then come home and jumped on it, but a friend did. I plan on selling it at my next garage sale and I'll look for something more accurate."
4,"Hefty, accurate bathroom scale",This scale is heavy and holds its position on the floor. It's attractive and the dial is easy to read and the scale appears to be extremely accurate. I recommend it to anyone who has the room for it and wants accuracy.
4,Simplicity,"This scale is pretty good for a mechanical scale. It is bordering on humongous in size, so it's comfortable to stand on and the dial is easy to read. It is extremely accurate, which was the reason for this purchase in the first place. I've not had good luck with digital scales lately.The only complaint is that it sometimes takes more than one adjustment for it to be centered on zero."
5,Truth Machine,Not the prettiest scale but deadly accurate. It's a delightful scale for anyone that might need to put their glasses on to see their weight in the morning. This scale is B I G! Much bigger than it looks online. It's easy to keep clean and most important of all it needs no battery. My parents Health-o-Meter is over 30 years old and it's just as accurate today as it was in 1976. That is THE reason I selected this product. I'm happy to say they still build a quality scale that will reward you when you exercise!
3,"Too heavy, poor balance",Metal scale was tooheavy amd poorly balanced. Flipped over while climbing off and hurt my foot. Internal parts broke prematurely and scale had to be scrapped. Buy something else.
1,Inaccurate,I have CHF and must weigh myself every morning. I need a scale that is very accurate. This one is not. Plus it goes by 2 pound increments. The numbers I thought would be large enough for me to be able to tell if I had lost a pound or gained one. With this scale I can only go by 2 pounds. I'm very unhappy with it.
2,what!?!?!? i lost how much weight,when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs. but after reading other review i realize the scale is off up to 9 lbs. also this is a big scale. too big to store in the bathroom
2,Mr. T,"Nice scale, but way to large for a standard home. Will not stay set at O.Could be used better in a packing plant somewhere."
3,soso,Have to keep adjusting the scale to zero. This can become a pain in the neck at times. But it does the correct weight.
1,We could not read this scale...,"We could not read the scale with any accuracy because the lines are so close together. So whether it was accurate or not is anyone's guess. What makes it a ""professional dial"" is hard to figure. We were very disappointed and returned it."
1,INACURATE READINGS,I USED THIS FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS BEFORE I FOUND OUT THAT IS VERY INACURATE AS MUCH AS 5 LBS.
1,Don't buy this scale,"I bought this Health-O-Meter large dial scale and it wasn't worth a dime. It did not weigh correctly. It couldn't be set to zero like it should have, and it was very unstable. I almost fell off of it because it tipped over. Don't buy this scale."
2,Not Recommended for accuracy,"This is a decent scale. You get what you pay for. This scale must be on a completely leveled floor in order to get an accurate number. I have used this scale for a while, and many times after you get on the first time, you have to fix the adjuster dial, and get on again to make sure what you saw the first time was right. Cheap and pretty precise. You better have plenty of room in you bathroom though, because this item is BULKY. Much happier with the digital scale I had prior to this."
3,Didn't seem too durable to me,"I don't know how long a scale is supposed to last, but after about 18 months of light use, this scale is very difficult to read, because the needle is all over the place. As I stand on it and try to read my weight, the reading varies as much as 7 pounds.It was good for a while, then got kind of flaky."
4,Its Big,Its big and sturdy enough to weigh just about anything. Ever tried to weigh a big dog at home? Pick up the dog and stand on the scale read the weight. Get off the scale put the dog down get back on the scale read the weight. Subtract the second weight from the first to get the weight of the dog... Simple eh ;0) I was very surprised about the quality of this scale I'd have expected to have paid 4 or more times the price for this unit. Seriously you can't beat it.
4,Heavy weight scale for a heavy weight person,"Most commercially available scales will weigh only up to 250 pounds or so, which is fine for the petite sized person who is agonizing over gaining an additional ounce but it is useless for the heavyweight person who is trying to shed twenty or more pounds. The expanded range on this scale of up to 400 pounds makes it ideal for the heavyweight person (such as myself)."
2,Doesn't Hold Up!!,I've been using this scale regularly for about four months. Lately it's all over the place-as much as a 5 pound variance after resetting. I'm replacing it.
5,Great analog scale,"This scale is accurate, consistent, and easy to read. The tick marks are small but are not hard to make out. The adjuster works pretty well and seems flawless after two or three cycles of adjustment and testing. After the initial calibration, I didn't have to fool with the adjustment knob at all. I would buy this scale all over again and recommend it to a friend."
2,"strong, durable? yes ... accurate? not even close","This thing seemed to be fairly accurate for the first 1-3 months of use, but after time it seems to get completely off when it comes to accuracy. Sure, it's a very sturdy scale (and BIG) but I'm going to be ordering another model this weekend. At first I would notice changes of as much as 5 pounds, I figured maybe they had to do with little things such as eating or whatever, but most recently, the thing changed by 15 pounds within a few hours of eachother ... which is IMPOSSIBLE. It's so inaccurate that I no longer can even use it."
4,Does the Job!,"The Health o Meter is a large footprint scale, which is exactly what I needed as a 6'1"" guy who weighes too much. My feet actually fit on this one! Seems to be accurate. Recommend for the guys and gals with big feet."
2,Don't be fooled,"This analog scale looks like a high-end/high-quality version, but don't be fooled by its sturdy looks.The scale reading will vary 1-8 pounds while you are standing on it! Even with slight movements the reading will vary. Its difficult to tell what you really weigh unless you stand in the same position every time.I wouldn't buy this unit again and would return it if I hadn't thrown out the box."
2,"Works for a couple week, and then wigs out! 9 lbs difference!","Yes, this scale worked great for the first few weeks, and then on a whim it just decided to add nearly 10 lbs OVER NIGHT!! Now,knowing that it is damn near impossible for something like this to happen, I still wondered if maybe, just maybe.... my diet took a turn... even though I never cheated on it. :( So I asked my wife (Who is also on the same diet) to check and see if she too, was a crAzy person. She was. Soooo, I recommend not buying ANY of their scales. This is the second one... and I had the same results the first time."
2,Inaccurate readings are easy to see.,"About the only positive thing I can say is that the display is easy to see. It is necessary to bend down, reach under the scale and reset the beginning to zero each time you step on the scale. Step on and off 5 times and you will get 5 different weight readings.I plan to donate mine to the new hospice opening down the street. Just too much bother to return it."
5,Great product except for the audio from the Blackberry,"Great product except for the audio from the Blackberry.I haven't figured out how to get the audio to my Bluetooth headset, and the audio from my Blackberry 8700c is terrible. Tech support was no help. Otherwise, the functionality works great."
4,a great review,"I have to contradict the one star review. I have had stats classes but keep forgetting how to use stats. This book provides a quick, simple refresher. Yes, there are mathematical formulas, but I don't think you can explain stats without them and the book explains each formula in words. I think I'm getting more usable info out of this book than out of my classes."
1,Nothing Simple About It,"If you were looking for a text based definition of the concepts behind basic statistical methods, this book will sorely disappoint you. Although less dense than a stats textbook, and composed of sections that address just the methods you missed the first time around, if it's the overwhelming presence of numbers and formulas that confused you in class, this book will be little help.If you are already familiar with statistical methods, and want more suggestions on how to conduct a study, or practice on particular problems, this may be an appropriate book for you. I'm still looking for an intelligent discussion of concepts that isn't contained in a book with Dummies or Idiots plastered across the cover."
4,Somewhat Difficult,I saw this movie and then read the book as a young teen. I wanted my teen to read it as well as reread it myself. I found it difficult. There was something about the language that didn't flow. Nonetheless a good book.
2,Not worth it,"This product makes the PSP too bulky. Its looses its apeal as a small light portable divice.For that uch money my advice is to buy a couple of 2GB memory sticks. Same ammount of space, more portable, more convenient, faster loading and don't change the overall shape of you PSP.I have the logitech portecting case and if I want to use it, I have to remove the hard drive which defeats its whole purpose."
1,Obsolete Technology,"This big clunky old hard drive is useless and overpriced now that SanDisk has a 4GB Memory Stick Pro Duo for $113. It is smaller and makes more sense to buy. Also it is rumored that an 8GB Memory Stick Pro Duo may be out by years end. Do yourself a favor and get the new smaller, cheaper, and more reliable Memory Stick Pro Duo."
1,Useless!,"They are selling this outdated technology for two hundred dollars? Gimme a break! It is so bulky, but you look at the Ipods with their 30-80 Gig hard drives and see how sleek and small they are. Also, I bought a 4 Gig duo memory card at Best Buy for eighty dollars. It has just as much storage space, it's cheaper, faster access time, smaller, and oh yeah, CHEAPER without any moving parts. They should sell this for 20 bucks to be viable in the marketplace, otherwise, just get a 4 Gig mem card."
4,not bad at all,"I was really surprised by the quality of sound on these when I first brought them home. I originally purchased them as a replacement headset headphones for VOIP, but music is not bad at all on these. If you are on a budget and thinking of getting a headset that will not only surpass some more expensive ocounterparts in sound quality, but is also great for VOIP, check these out."
5,gRRRRREAAT,i WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT THE QUALITY OF THE HEADPHONES BUT ESPECIALLY THE MIKE. GRRRREAT.
4,Pretty wacky,"Amusing novel, with vivid everything - vivid characters, vividly comic mishaps (accidental or otherwise), vivid style. Mick Stranahan is a hero you cheer for; all the women are intelligent and beautiful; and Chemo, he of the onion skin complexion, is a very memorable hitman. I found the satire on our looks-obsessed society particularly fun and gratifying. Quite long, but with lots of minor support characters and intricate plotting. Enjoyable, even if you don't usually read crime/mystery novels."
3,Abridged Too Far,"I had previously listened to the unabridged version from the library. It was hilarious. A year or so later when I wanted to hear it again, the library no longer had it so I bought this abridged version. There is so much wackiness in this book that you can't follow it in the abridged version, it just sounds silly."
2,Carl has jumped the shark,"This book has the usual whacky characters, the greed, the bluntly comic disasters, deaths and oddball dismemberments yada yada. Ultimately, it feels like Carl has begun to ""mail it in"". His books are now so formulaic....it's like a college kid wrote a derivative Hiaasen novel...hell, I think I could write one by now. It just isn't well or thoughtfully written, and this from someone who has loved Hiaasen's work in the past. There are a few chuckles, but it all seems forced. It's like he peaked with Nature Girl and has lost his edge.I wouldn't recommend this book....I was bored."
5,A re-read,"One of his best, I think I read it in paperback a few years ago and it was better this time!"
4,Even Mediocre Hiaasen is Better Than Most,"I have read several Hiaasen books and this one is not quite as good as the others. However, it is still pretty good. There is the usual cast of crazy characters in crazy situations that will make you laugh. Some of the situations just went a little over the top for me (why would one of the characters use a weed-whacker as a prosthesis for a missing hand?). I also felt that he told us a little too much up front instead of letting us discover it as the book went along."
4,More whackiness from Hiaasen,"Carl Hiaasen creates the craziest characters. I would expect no other author to create an ex-Amish hit man with a horrible facial disfigurement and a weed whacker for a hand replacement, and make him believable. Unlike some of Hiaasen's other novels, the situation here isn't completely outrageous... just the cast (including Reynaldo Flemm, who is so obviously patterned after Geraldo Rivera in his early days of being attacked by white supremacists). Someone is trying to kill Mick Stranahan, and once he discovers that it's related to the disappearance of a young woman four years ago, he figures the best way for his life to return to its peaceful normality is for him to solve that mystery. It becomes a game of kill or be killed for Mick, and along the way he may just have met his 6th wife. I enjoyed this much more than the last Hiaasen I read, Sick Puppy."
5,"Funny, daring thriller","Hiaasen peoples his novels with the oddest, most interesting characters imaginable. Then he throws them into almost-ridiculous situations. The result is a wild ride of laughs and raised eyebrows and unforeseeable turns. If you like your thrillers tongue-in-cheek, but yet believable and in-your-face, this one's a great choice. I read it in one evening and I wish I hadn't already read his other novels, because I'm wanting more."
2,It Tries Too Hard & Yet Still Not Hard Enough,"Some good friends recommended this book to me--friends for whom I have a great deal of respect. But I don't get it. The jokes seemed familiar, like ones I'd heard before. The characters were just too lame to endure. It's not that I demand sympathetic characters, it's just that I'd like a reason to care what happens to them. Maybe a more compelling mystery would've kept my interest. Maybe not. Wacky just wasn't enough."
4,Skin tight,Funny Cinderella story. Great Hiassen characters that live fast-paced lives. A quick and fun read.
3,This book is scary,"I did not like this book. Too complex to be fun. Unexpectedly bloody. Could have been sexier just to lighten things up. It is not as smooth as Hiaaen's more recent novels. The book itself is an excess. Too many characters that hang around too long, some should never have been introduced as they served no real purpose and got dropped later, like Al the Cuban detective. And there were too many strange and mysterious deaths of people who were guilty but did not, in my opinion, deserve to be killed like George. Mick may not be a killer, but he was certainly an accessory as things got more and more out of control. I thought that whole story line with the rezoning for the apartment building was unnecessary. Skin Tight would have benefited by focusing more attention on the clinic and its patients and doctors. Oh well. Not great, but still good."
5,Skin tight by Carl hiaasen,"I read my first book by carl Hiaasen titled 'Skinny Dip"" and i am hooked...Great funny laugh out laugh read...a must for summer reading...I have purchased 6 more of his books...all I just LOVE!!!!Plus on the back of the jacket...he is a good piece of eye candy.............."
2,What a Disappointment!,"I ordered this book after reading the superlative online reviews it recceived here. Perhaps Hiassen is an acquired taste, but this book left me cold. The characters were not well developed, the plot was not compelling, and the writing was not crisp. It was an effort to get through to the end. The moral of the story is: If you want Elmore Leonard, but Elmore Leonard."
2,skin tight,"This book was said to be in good condition, but I disagree. The pages are very yellowed and the binding is not intact. I was disappointed with the condition of this book."
1,a waste of time to read,"Clearly one of the worst pieces of junk I've ever had the misfortune to read. I can't believe it got into print. Too bad, as Hiassen is an excellent columnist and certainly has the intellect and familiarity with Miami to produce something better"
4,First. Time reader of Carl Hiaasen,This a very interesting and fast moving book. You will not be disappointed if you read this book. Now I hope I can find more books by Carl Hiaasen!
5,One of his best,"The debut of Chemo, one of Hiaasen's most colorful characters (and that's saying a lot!) Mick Stranahan at his very best."
4,Amusing Chaos,"This is the 4th Hiaasen book that I have read.I wish it was the first, because I believe I would have been able to enjoy Hiaasens dry humor and crazy characters more. But since this was the 4th time round I knew what to expect.This story is about a plastic surgeon who accidently murders a patient and covers it up. The characters that are good, bad, and so bad they are good are out of this world vein and a better trainwreck than Lindsay Lohan.I read this book in a week and very much enjoyed the story.Carl Hiaasen must have a thing against selfish , vein and money hungry people, because he ruins their lives in this book more than I or anyone could imagine!Great Beach Read."
5,one of Christmas best,"Saw this years ago,am thrilled its out on dvd!One of the best Christmas movies!"
5,Snow,"If you like Christmas movies like me you go to love Snow. It has a clear, fun sentimental storie and the best of all this year ABC Family Movies make the second part Snow 2: Brain Freeze."
4,Cute Funny Movie,I love Christmas Movies so this one caught my eye. It is a movie you can watch with the whole family. Its a cute funny movie to watch with your popcorn and M&Ms.
3,DVD Snow,I was so depressed that this story did not have close captionedso we gave to other friends and I didnt have a chance to ask if they have seen it
4,Go: The Very Best of Moby,"Go: The Very Best of Moby~ Moby is a great anthology of Mobys hits. If one had simply gone by the sheer excellence of the music then it would have easily gotten 5 stars. However, Moby commits a cardinal sin in my book. This being that mixes music and politics. I am not a fan of music and politics mixing and the essay that he writes borders on eccentric insanity. The production value is astounding and Moby has much better vocal ability then expected. He writes interesting and thought worthy lyrics and is one accomplished artist. I feel that he does himself a great disservice by including his over the top politics since as a creative artist he is one of the best in the business. It gets 4 stars but should have received more if he toned down his political thoughts."
1,2 broken bits during first use,"Got these on Friday, had to install 18 doors today. Broke 2 of these bits before I had 3 doors drilled. It is nice that I can replace the bits but still annoying that I have to get new bits now."
4,self centering bits,I found that these self-centering bits do work but some care is required to ensure that the hole is actually centered. Applying some reasonable pressure is required and you do need to worry about keeping the drill bit as near vertical as you can.
1,cheap,"piss poor, the drill broke the first time I used it and they are made very cheap I would not recommend this product"
2,Not what I was expected,"I actually bought this item because I really wanted to improve and speed up my cabinet making work.Well, it obviously didn't meet my expectation. The holes are way of the center, and I am doing much better work without them.In my opinion - waste of money.Thanks for reading, Gingko."
5,Read It Over and Over,"I have not only highlighted the daylights out of this book, I'm starting on my fourth time reading it. It has helped me deeply realize that anger in me is like acid in a styrofoam cup - it destroys the container. Thubten Chodron has a gift for translating the Buddhist teachings and philosophies into plain language that anyone can understand and apply.This is the kind of book that I keep 2 or 3 copies on hand to give to friends, relatives and co-workers. It's a wonderful way to help people in conflict without being preachy.I hope I get to meet Thubten Chodron one day so I can thank her for blessing us with this book."
3,Complete Vol1,This has excellent piano transcriptions for a lot of Billy Joel songs. If you are a big Billy Joel fan and can play the piano I would definetly recommend this book. Also a good book to look at after volume 1 would be volume 2 or 3 or if you dont want to buy all of the books seperately you can buy Billy Joel Complete 1&2 which is one book but incudes all of the songs from those books. Either way this would be a great book to buy.
4,Easy Play is easy,A great grade 1 or 2 easy piano book. A little easier than I expected but that works well for my level.
5,Exactly what dad wanted,"My Dad has been wanting this book for months, and I found it for a good price. And the item delivered quickly."
3,Billy Joel Complete review,"If youre looking for something just to give you an idea of how to play a lot of Billy Joel songs, this book can be helpful. It has just about every song in it up until the river of dreams. Songs like Prelude/Angry Young Man, and Shes Got a Way are nicely done in this book. But others only give you the piano parts to play the melody, so if you want to play the music instrumentally only, this is a good book. However, if youre like I am and you want to start playing the music and singing along with it(playing in a band), then you should look at the Billy Joel Keyboard book which has 14 or so songs which have the original transcripts, what you actually here him playing on the piano on the album. This is by far my favorite piano book that I own. It is however for the experienced piano players, because of its detail."
4,Almost right on,Pretty much the same as Volume 2I play Guitar and Keyboards. The only book better is Billy Joel Keyboard Book.If you are a Billy Joel fan these 2 volumes are great.
2,another just kinda there album from GB,"George Benson has always done albums in this Vein of trying to Be Hip&also keep a little something,something for His Loyal base. but this album like so many He has put out over the past Decade&Half just is missing that Knock Out song.He has put out some cool Jams&Covers but He is Missing that one song.I applaud any Artist willing to up-date themselves but if you are willing to do it then go all the way.if He wanted R.kelly based tracks then he should have gone directly to the Source as to getting left-overs from the cutting room floor versions.GB is still One of the tightest Guitar Players&overall Artists but Projects like this seem just kinda there."
2,Disappointing...,"As a long time George Benson fan, I waited with great anticipation for this new album. Afer each song, I waited for George's powerful voice, talents and emotion to emerge...didn't happen, sorry to say. It never hurts to experiment with blending styles of music...in this case, blending hip hop and smooth jazz just didn't work. The music just isn't memorable. I agree with another reviewer -- some lyrics didn't sound comfortable for George to sing. He is truly a class act with great talents to offer. If you like Benson at his best, stick with his past efforts."
3,"Easy does it, but not really","George Benson is having a hard time keeping up the quality of his records. After the surprising Absolute Benson, he seemed to have found a style of music which combined his jazzy sound and his need to give it a bit R&B-flavour. This album nevertheless is a little bit too much of R&B. Therefore this album gets a little slick. His brilliant guitar playing is overflown by beats and R&B-voices, and that's a pitty. The sound is ok, but is doesn't sparkle. And that's what we may expect from a guy with his talents."
1,Bad attempt at making a contemporary album...,"Was this album really necessary? George Benson is something short of an icon when it comes to Jazz - and if you want to remember him that way I can only advise you to stay clear of this album.It's a bad attempt to make a 'modern-sounding' album - at the cost of being original. It's like all the popular music you can hear on the radio today, the Ushers', the Justin Timberlakes' or even the Britney Spears'...I had the chance to see him at North Sea Jazz a couple of years ago and wondered why he so desperately wanted to be on stage as a singer. Listening to this album I ask my self the same question. Sorry to say, but this must definately the worst album he ever made."
1,GRP's worst...,"As a fan of both R&B;/Jazz, this album comes as schock! I never knew jazz/r&b; could clash like this.Everything is so bizarre with this production, I don't know where to start?!1. The lyrics sound like Craig David...LIGHT!, the ""contemporary"" (infantile) lyrics sound ""funny"" & laughable in George's mouth, kind of a Monthy Python kinda way...2. The production is boring & lame, no variations in arrangement/tempos whatsoever...I have a postive note: the chorus of the 1st track, that's about it. Sorry..."
1,irreplaceable should be replaced!!!,"No no no this can't be happening to all us devoted GB fans.I've waited for several years for this New George Benson CD to come out and hit the stands. When I heard that it was an import I said hang the cost! Let me at it!Wow what a horrible let down. No guitar work except for this guy that is playing a sick acoustic guitar.It like his third or forth release for WB when the guitarist that played Flash Dance, only worse!I didn't want to resort to buying bootleg recording of GB but whats left? Wait another 4 years for this type of S___???!!!"
1,The Title Says It All,Easily the most Non-Benson George Benson CD. If You're a GB devotee (like myself) This is one to pass up.If you're a rap/hip hopper buff who's curious about Jazz then this one is for you!It has trace elements of Jazz while maintaining a hip-hop theme. What was George thinking when he did this one? It was a great ideal (to someone) but POOR execution. Avoid this CD
1,I'v been duped!,"Did you know that a CD can have the same title and picture on it and have entirely different songs?That's what happened to me. I bought George Benson's latest, ""Irreplaceable"", expecting to find the most popular cut, ""Softly As In A Morning Sunrise"" BUT IT ISN'T ON THERE!And neither are a few others. How else can the public be duped? This CD was bought through CDGIVEAWAYS. DON'T USE THEM!"
1,Mutton dressed as lamb,"The greatest jazz guitarist of modern history has forgotten how to play the guitar.The few licks he does play are basic and boring.The vocals are quite honestly an embarassment.Mr Benson simply does not have the force of voice or vocal dynamics to sing this type of R&B.;The songs themselves are not even average.This is an album to bore and put you to sleep.The worst album recorded by George Benson for over 25 years. George,go back to what you do best - Play the guitar and scatt - get together with some great musicians as on Absolute Benson and play jazzy funky tunes.Hopefully this was a stomach ache you needed to get out of your system - that passed I hope the next album finds you well!!Having read some other reviews I thought I may have been unfair so I listened again. Absolutely terrible - I could barely give my copy away.By the way I produce Smooth Jazz albums."
2,Horrible!!!!,"George Benson can be one of the best guitar players, make some of the best recordings, and sound so good, if he wanted to. If you think George Benson is any kind of jazz, you'd be right. He even started out playing straight ahead jazz. But by no means, is this a jazz album.Many of the songs on here are horrible R&B; with vocals, by Benson. That's ok if that's what you like, but I curtainly dont. We already got enough R&B; vocalists. Benson is a talented man! Why does he have to lower himself to play this garbage.The only good song on this CD is Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise; and that's questionable. No, George Benson did not pull it off with his latest effort. Benson, you gotta play some jazz.Any thing else, but this. Lay off the R&B; vocals and show the world what a talented jazz guitarist you are!"
1,George Benson hits Rock Bottom - A painful listen!!!,"Who the hell is this, R. Kelly? and why was is garbage in the Jazz section? Frankly the song material sounds like an R&B Viagra Meltdown as Mr. Benson trys to let the world know he's as current as Usher; what a joke!!I feel sorry for anyone who purchaces this CD, and would put it with William Hungs album Inspiration any day.PS- How long has it been since George let us know he can play?- Decades. cheers jb."
2,What a waste of talent,"I have been buying his albums for years and never regretted a single purchase, until NOW!!!But Hey George you more than make up for it in 'Absolutely Benson', so Ill forgive for this."
5,Finally!!!!! A great R&B cd was released,"i'm a spanish fan of soul music of the 90's.these days is almost impossible to find a good soul/r&b; cd to purchase.In the 90's i had to buy about 2 or 3 cds per week. Now, with all the rap & hip hop topping the charts,what kind of music could i purchase? LUTHER, ANITA, LALAH, SMOOTH JAZZ & maybe, some Joe's cd. AND OF COURSE, THIS TERRIFIC CD BY mr.BENSON.If you're a fan of good r&b; music and you hate the hip hop music, buy this cd NOW!!!! You won't regret!!"
1,By George What has happened???,"If there is ever a musician/singer with the ability to keep his sound relevant to today it is George Benson...Sadly this C.D misses the boat terribly. All the soul of his vocals have been sucked out by obviously doing take after take so that the songs on the C.D could be patched together later. George certainly became aware of this by insisting the album be changed and new songs added after it's initial 2003 release. Alas, while l still think GB to be the most naturally gifted and versatile guitarist/singer that ever lived this C.D doesn't breath life in the way l know a Great Benson disc should."
2,Very Disappointing.,"George Benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time. I bought this CD with the hope of hearing George Benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about. George Benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks, ""Softly, As In a Mountain Sunrise"" and ""Arizona Sunrise."" These are the only two tracks produce by Paul Brown. The other instrumental, ""Take You Out"" is a tribute to Luther Vandross and is on the ""Forever, For Always, For Luther"" CD. George Benson does showcase some of his talent, but he kept the song true to Luthers' rendition ""Take You Out."" The bottom line is: if you think George Benson is a great vocalist, you will love this CD, and in my opinion, he is just tolerable. Three instrumental tracks, seven vocal tracks, this CD is not ""Irreplaceable."""
1,The s**t hits the fan! Big time!,"This is GRP's worst album ever! Well, it can only go up for GB & GRP from here. How this CD came about is the million dollar question.The hrm ""producer"" is the higly incompetent Joshua Thompson, one of the worst R&B; producers....ever! The whole album is totally infantile, & I haven't even mentioned the lyrics!? Now, I don't want to blame the producer for this mess, I believe the exec's would have had a say in this also...& GB himself of course.On a positive note there are a couple of 2nds in ""Sixplay""'s chorus that are OK, other than that???For those thinking this is good R&B;, well you've got some reading up 2 do. Who could've produced this kind of project a 100 times better?: Well, George Duke, Jamey Jaz, Neptunes, Rodney Jerkins, Lee Ritenour...a couple of 100 people more including myself. Promise ;)If you're looking for Jazz or R&B;, almost any album out there is better than this one. Really!"
4,The Evolution of Benson,"This CD is a very worthwhile effort from George. Although some will say it's not classic Benson, I beg to differ. The CD is very well organized. It starts off with the fast paced ""Irreplacable"" then slows you down just a little with ""Cell Phone"". All the Luther fans will love Benson's rendition of ""Take You Out"". The album picks back up with ""Missing You"". Although Benson's lyrics aren't the best they are better than average. This is solid offering from Benson, which shows that even a old-head like Benson can evolve and appeal to todays generation."
3,Costly evolution?,"George Benson is an automatic purchase for me no matter what the content is; My opinion however of this CD is that it's unfortunate that great artists of the past have to evolve to stay popular with current audiences to get airplay as well as sell CD's. This CD does not deliver the reminder of how truly great and talented George Benson really is. The feeling (particularly on the vocal tracks) is that someone decided these were good songs to sing, as opposed to songs that were written specifically for George Benson to sing (see Luther Vandross/Richard Marx - ""Dance with my father""). Perhaps the older stuff doesn't pay the bills anymore, its just unfortunate that the cost evolving musically comes at the expense of all around quality."
3,Good album,"I want to love this cd. Their previous effort As The World is in my Top 10 Albums of all time. As such, I was really excited about this release. However, it doesn't quite live up to my expectations. The songs are fairly complex, with vocal intertwinings and some nice classical musical influences. As The World took me many listens before I could fully appreciate it and hear everything it had to offer. I gave this album the same treatment, yet after repeated listenings, it still doesn't grab me as much. It's still a great album, and if you're an echolyn fan, it's a must-have. It's good to see the boys back."
5,Many listens bring this to the top,"When this was first released I was quite disappointed. No, it wasn't bad, but it sure didn't send me like As The World did. Since then I've gotten to listen to it many more time, and had a chance to integrate the lyrics a bit. I also saw Echolyn live in Lowell, MA. They performed many of these tunes as well as the entire Mei. All of this together has made me appreciate this as a work of genius: intricate but not show-off musicianship and truly intelligent lyrics that say something about America.With the triad of As The World, Cowboy Poems Free, and the capstone, Mei, Echolyn proves that they are among the finest bands out there."
5,My Review,I have very flat feet and no arch in my feet (shoe store lady told me she never seen such flat feet in her entire life) She recommended the Gel Kayno Shoes and they have been really Great! So good in Fact that I decided to only wear Gel Kayno shoes...My first pair cost me $139.00 and a year and some months later I decided I like them so much that I brought the exact same pair for $79.00. (i wear these shoes with arch support insules from finish line and really i have not found a better more comfortable shoe)
1,The best of ruben blades,"The two CDs were scratched at different songs, only reason why I did not return it is to avoid the hassle. Will not purchase music from this vendor again. Ruben is my favorite but not this distributor."
2,"A useful book, but other works cover the subject better.","Generally the book contains some useful advice, but I found the style intensely irritating and I have read other books that deal with the same basic material in a far less annoying manner. If gratuitous pictures and diagrams, a load of go-getting over-the top positive spin and plenty about God are your scene, buy this book. If you're an educated adult agnostic, try something else."
2,A CRASH COURSE!,"This workbook literally is a very fast trip through the textbook of the same name - like going through the fast lane check-out in your local supermarket! While there are certain elements of the workbook many individuals will find helpful, for maximum benefit I would strongly recommend the textbook over the workbook. At least in my country, where the price of the book in Canadian dollars, is the US price plus half the price again, I was disappointed with the workbook. For my money, I certainly did not feel the workbook, based on what little information it contained and the relatively few pages, was a wise or prudent investment."
1,Out of date,This book is out of date. Also it has many religious comments throughout. Why someone would put religious comments in a job search book is beyond me. I threw this book away.
1,"Sounds good in theory, but ridiculous in practice","This book is absolute garbage. My only regret with this review is that I can't give it less than one star. Bolles' advice is impractical and seriously misleads a job hunter. The ""old way"" of getting jobs, which Bolles disparages, is still the only realistic way of landing a job. Sure, its a tough process, but its the only thing out there.If Bolles really had the answer, his book would outsell McDonalds. And it hasnt. Save your money , and your time. Avoid this book like the plague."
2,What Color Is Your Parachute Workbook,The book is mostly limitless propaganda. I had to order it for a career building course.
3,Satisfied,I had to order this book for a class and I have yet to read it through but others have told me its a great tool to have when exploring your career options.
2,Too fluffy,"This book has some interesting material, but is spaced out so much. It is too chatty, too religious. It should be brief and concise, then people would have a realistic chance of reading it all."
2,Too much religion,"This book should carry a warning label ""Prepare to be bombarded with Christianity!"" I bought this book in hopes that it would live up to its reputation unfortunately I'm not sure I'm going to be able to gain any benefit from it because of wading through all of the religion the author forced into the book."
2,Required Reading for me,"As a student taking an internship, this book is required reading as part of my program. I am on the last chapter right now and have found this book to offer little insight on any kind of career choices, and the tips for interviews are either common sense, or far-fetched. This book may offer some insight only if the reader knows their general direction and may need motivation, but to a college student I would suggest getting some other information elsewhere, say a career development center. This book should be a last resort if you really have problems getting hired."
4,Worth the cost,"Not essential to own, but a good working companion to the `What color is your parachute?' book.As you will be creating a plan or map of yourself and your career objectives, having a workbook that you fill-in, will refer to, and keep for life...then the small amount of its cost is worth it."
3,Easy to use and understand,"The small workbook summarizes everything from the large textbook into a easy to use format.I got much more, quicker, from the workbook than I did from the textbook."
1,All fluff and no meat,"After all the hype about this book, I found it to be an extreme disappointment. Very religious,and points people to try things most people cannot do. It's a book that impresses many, but I would think, in the long run helps very few."
3,Common sense for anyone that has been to an interview,"This book is nice for someone who has never been to an interview and is completely intimidated and at a loss for what to say and what to do. Otherwise, this book is pretty useless. Especially this ""life changing"" job hunt stuff. Let's get real... unless you have education somewhat pertaining to the field you want, the chances are pretty slim to none that you will get the job you are trying for. There are better resources out there..."
1,"For a complete career change, consider a different book","This book was not helpful for finding the right career, in a complete career change. I lothed the career I was in. This was the first career book I bought because of the recomendation of several people including a couple of career counselers. I believe people recommend this book because of its popularity and not its content. Finding the right career is not a quick and easy 1,2,3 process, it takes time and consideration. I believe this book makes it a bit more difficult than it has to be. I found this book wordy and lengthy; and it seems to have lots of useless information. The excersizes, while interesting, leave alot to be desired and they are a bit time comsuming. After getting fustrated with this book I bought a much more useful book called ""I Don't Know What I Want, but I Know It's Not This""."
3,"not bad, not great","Well, if you have the book itself. There is not much new information. This is a good idea for a class, but I would not recommend it if you are buying it on you own. On the other hand, there some cool stuff in it, but I don't think it is worth the price."
3,Do not give it to students graduating from college.,"This book is useful if you are middle aged and unemployed, but not for a graduating college student looking for an entry level job into a specific career."
4,Many answers to different questions,"Got the answer to some of my questions but I was hoping for an easier solution because I was depressed. But when you are depressed, there is no easy solutions. Just solutions. And when the fog lifts, you can give some credit to the info that helped. Which in this case was this book."
2,Too Complicated,"I lost my job and the economy is really killing my career. So I decided it was time for a career change. I bought this workbook because it had great reviews. I think it has a good concept but, the graphs are so extensive."
4,practical guide; others also recommended,"What Color is Your Parachute 2002 is a practical guide to finding your career calling, what interests you, and what skills you can leverage. I would recommend the book as an adjunct to any job search or career change. For job search information or career change, I would also highly recommend the guides published by Vault.com, including the Vault Guide to Resumes and Cover Letters, the Vault Guide to Schmoozing, and the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews."
2,Not so excellent as it is hyped about...,"I purchased this book recently. Given the amount of praise Amazon's customers have given it, I expected it to help me resolve my indecision. (I have three major fields to choose from) Nope, it does not. It's a good book, but it doesnot come anywhere close to ""The Pathfinder"" (which in my opinion, is the BEST). Barbara and Paul Tieger's ""Do what you are"" is second. My view is that once you can target what you want, getting it is a lot easy. You will not then need any special techniques or tricks because your heart will show the way. Get ""The Pathfinder"" first and do all the exercises there. Maybe you won't need this one then."
3,"If you've got the regular text, you don't need this...","I though this would provide more info than the book (""What Color Is Your Parachute?"") but what's inside are the same exercises... so if you have the book or are getting it, then you don't need this. On the other hand, if you don't want to read all of the insightful text of Bolles's original book, then this is a nice book of exercises! :) [I'd just recommend the original text, though.]"
1,a stolen library cd collection - really disappointed,"I had just recently ordered a book on audio cds of ""What Color is Your Parachute"", after having taken it out of my local public library. I decided I wanted to own this book for future reference. Sadly, what I received in the mail was the same audio cd copy of this book, also taken from a public library somewhere in the US. This seller seems to have sold me something they essentially stole from a library. None of this was indicated in the description of the product, otherwise, I would never have purchased this. Very disappointed.A"
5,This is one book I don't lend out without a deposit.,"While Mr.Bolles has been publishing this job-seekers bible for 25 years, unfortunately I have only collected the last five issues.A MUST HAVE for anyone considering a change in employment, and for career counselling practitioners"
1,Not Very Useful...,"For years people have been telling me about this book. I put aside my resistance and went out to buy the book. I now know that I should listen to my instincts more often! I learned a lesson by making this purchase: listen to your gut. This is also the way I will be finding my career path, because I found the author to be not so helpful with his advice. Although going door-to-door may work well for people in large metropolitain areas, it is not so useful for people in a smaller rural area. Save your money and buy stamps for your resumes!"
3,A New Book On the Block,"What Color Is Your Parachute is the classic job-hunting tool - good exercises that make you think and hold you accountable. But they are also a bit blah and boring, and the religious commentary is a bit unnerving. There's a new player in the market that's getting a lot of buzz - Women for Hire: The Ultimate Guide to Getting a Job! I picked this up after hearing Regis and Kelly plug the book on their show. It's great! The tone is dynamic and motivating and the exercises focus on clear actions that you can take now. The authors do a great job of lifting your spirits. The anecdotes and feedback from recruiters and other human resource professionals helped me understand what goes on on the other side of the desk, once my resume is received. I incorporated a number of the tips and tricks detailed and am now interviewing for my dream job! I highly recommend this book!"
2,Boring,Poorly written. The characters were uninteresting. The conversations were stiff. The plot was stupid. I skipped and skimmed to get through it.
1,I hated this book!,"This is the worst book since The Warrior, also a stinker. Ms Jordan has gone from bad to worse, with a few very sexy, well written novels in between. I pre-ordered this formulaic tripe. Ms Jordan has either stopped trying to write well or has shot her wad and burned out. She seemed to have run out of ideas. This book was so awful that I skimmed through it and took it to the library to donate the very next morning. I couldn't stand to have it polluting my house. Ugh!!!!"
5,Fantastic purchase,This is an excellent historic romance novel that leaves you wanting more! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves erotic historical romances!
1,I'd rate this less if I could !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The book was somewhat decent, if you don't mind a horrible love scene. It was anything but romantic. I had to force myself to finish the book. Romance novels tend to (not always) have happy endings and are filled with passion and don't leave you feeling like you bought a flat screen tv in some alley only to open the box and find bricks instead of the tv !I hated their actual encounter. I found it incredibly disappointing and wonder how He could've handled it worse. I found an answer. HE COULDN'T. This was the worst ""first time"" (between main characters) I've ever read in a romance novel. From there on the novel ended in a downward spiral with no hope of ever making it back."
2,tedious,"I love Nicole Jordan's past novels but this one was not very engaging. I kept hoping it would turn out better, but it proved repetitive and predictable. Not worth the read."
3,Not the best Jordan but good anyways,I love Nicole Jordan she is a wonderful writer and because I read her so avidly I have to admit I was disapointed in this book. It's not spectacular but its not bad either. The plot itself is a bit worn out and the heroine is a bit too flakey. The hero a bit too nice no true spunk to him. All and All it was ok and if your bored enough an ok read.
3,A little disappointing,"The author writes well, but I found that he had simplified Vedanta too much. Often it seemed like he was elaborating and writing his own philosophy rather than sticking to the Vedantic writings. I have no doubt he is very knowledgeable - this just didn't turn out to be the book I was hoping for - which was one I could recommend to others who are interested in learning about Vedanta."
4,Stetina at his best!,"Troy Stetina is well known for his wide range of rock guitar dvd and book methods which I have tried and had much success with over the past couple of years. When I heard he also has an instrumental cd out I had to hear him flex his amazing electric guitar skills without the confines of his usual lesson style instrumentals. I was greatly impressed and inspired by many of the awesome tracks on this CD like ""Firewalker"" and ""Exottica."" If you wanna hear a great electric guitar album with plenty of amazing riffs and awesome shredding, do yourself a favor and get this cd!"
3,Don't believe all the hype,"I purchased this out of curiousity (as if I had extra ""curiosity "" money!). Well, it's okay, nothing so incredible. Yes , Troy can play guitar, very well as a matter of fact. But while I was listening and when it was over I didn't ever once say ""wow"" or feel the need to play it over again right away. I tend to compare all guitar players to Randy Rhoads and his awesome riffs and licks that stay in your head and demand to be played over again many times. Even make me want to reach for my guitar. I'll keep this disc and listen to it on my disc changer occasionally. But Troy, in the future, blow me away. This was just good guitar playing, nothing super duper memorable. I wish someone would make an instrumental CD that had Randy Rhoads, King Diamond and Iron Maiden riffage with awesome solos that would leave me with goose bumps."
3,Uncle Sam,Uncle Sam is a waste of time unless you're into low grade B-movie horror schlock. Only reason I gave it 3 stars was for the killing scenes.
1,Whoever thought this was a good movie has no taste!!!!!!!!!!,"The only reason i gave this movie 1 star because,it was funny as hell.The special F/X was one of the reasons it was funny,like the part where you can see the string when uncle sam gets blown away.Another was the horrible acting.And the funniest part is the bagrace."
1,Ha! Ha! Oh wait it was suppose to be scary!,"While watching this I couldn't help but laugh my head off.To think that anyone would put this in the horror section.The terrible acting, cheesy stunts, and boring plot all make it so funny.I really wish I hadn't wasted my dollar at the video store to rent this.Please do yourself a favor and don't rent this unless you want a good laugh."
5,UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU...to buy the dvd!,"OH MY GOD...UNCLE SAM I WANT YOU DEAD IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!! A MUST SEE! SCARY, SUSPENSFUL, AND VERY FUNNY! HOLLA"
4,Great movie....definitely worth seeing!,"After seeing a lot of mixed reviews on this movie, I decided to buy it. I was always interested in the story line as no horror flick has utilized ""Uncle Sam"" and Independence Day in a plot.Contrary to some reviews, the acting is quite good (especially for a straight to video movie). This movie also has several sub-plots which is a rarity for horror.The movie starts off a bit slow but quickly picks up the pace. There are some entertaining and creative ways Uncle Sam kills his victims. I won't spoil the movie and tell you, but you won't be disappointed.All in all an excellent flick and I would definitely recommend it for your DVD collection.I purchased a used copy on DVD and the movie looked and ran like it was brand new.Get some popcorn and turn out the lights.....this movie will definitely become a classic in due time."
2,disappointing,"Although I didn't expect much from this movie when I rented it, I was still disappointed. This is a could have been movie. There is a good story, but the filmmakers didn't put enough into the making of this film.The first half sets up the story. It makes it out to be a drama because the first killing doesn't happen until over half way through the movie. That is when the story stops. Because of the first half of this film, I kind of wished that they skipped the killings and developed the story and characters.This movie is strictly rental material unless you are, like me, a collector of horror films.Don't expect too much from it and it could be enjoyable."
2,"really wanted to like it, but just couldnt","Ive heard of this movie a while back and really wanted to see it. I bought the dvd immediately, never seeing it before and it not being available on netflix. Boy was i disappointed, this has all the ingredients to be a fun, campy and gory flick but it was all put the wrong way. its very boring and TOO serious. Uncle sam's voice is annoying and the kills are lame. Its hard to believe this was made by the same guy who directed MANIAC with joe spinell...see MANIAC instead, this movie blows."
1,"""So bad, it's good.""","Anyone who likes to pick out the flaws in low-budget b-grade movies for kicks will love Uncle Sam. The premise itself is laughable:Gulf war veteran Sam Harper's charred corpse comes back to life to wreak havoc on draft dodgers, flag burners, and those who are generally unpatriotic.Some great moments to watch for:- The race: first time I've ever seen a potato sack race where the sacks go all the way up to a person's neck! Of course, this allows for an easy but very lame decapitation scene.- The *blind* kid telling Isaac Hayes' character where to fire the cannon- The mysterious change of Sam's face: the first half of the movie has him looking like Freddy Kruger. Later on he bears a striking resemblance Swamp Thing.- The cannon scene: the ropes suspending Sam are in plain view- and plenty more!"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],Awesomely cheesy! This is how B-Movie's should be done. There is a small simple story that has just enough so that you can follow along and laugh at the stupidity and the cheesy special effects.
5,Well celebrated,"I received this CD as a gift in 2002 along with two other revels CDs. This one has remained an enduring favorite among everyone in my family, including my new Irish in-laws. The stories are well told, the music is lively while also inspiring, and while it is necessarily spiritual in nature, it doesn't come off like you've gone to church. A well executed collection!"
5,A Top-Notch Treatise for any Page Layout Program,"Even though I currently use Pagemaker 6.5 - this book remains at my side. It is quite simply the best reference on the subject of Page Layout. Even if you use another program, Ms Williams tips on good design are worth the price. Though Pagemakers interface has changed, nearly everything in this book pertains to the current version. Its also without doubt the most readable and beautifully designed computer book I've read to date. BUY IT! before its discontinued, You won't regret it."
4,10 pack switch,"I bought this pack before I shopped around. At Homedepot, you can get the same switch for a couple bucks cheaper. Plus, the switches at home depot have a glossy finish which appears much nicer, whereas this switch is the equivalent to a brass finish on metals (I think this prevents fingerprints appearing on the switches). All in all, this product is good."
4,Works,Works as expected. But I find it a little bulky although that is understandable given what it does.
5,"Best sequal to the best book, BUY THEM BOTH!","This is one of my favorite Authors, if you are Irish, or of that line, buy all of her books right now and save yourself from having to come back over and over like I did. If your not, go find yourself someone Irish to love, your kids will thank you for it. Loved them all so much I bought new copies just to have them. A little bit of history, with a novel built around them. Her style is hard to find anywhere. By the luck of the Irish we got her!"
5,Two thumbs wayyyyyyy up!,I have one word for this book: EXCELLENT! I thought that the descriptions of the battles were wonderfully vivid. It took my breath away! I could actually visualize the events taking place. I was there with them while they were fighting. . .I was there with them while they were . . . It was that real.
4,Great followup to the Lion of Ireland,"Morgan Llywelyn does it again.Another great book in her collection of historical fiction.We follow the happening of the sons of Brian Boru and all the other luminaries that created the political scene in the age of the viking, irelands awakening and the rethinking of kings and kingdoms.Though it does have some conjecture and uses items that have very little basis in history or have been proven it is still a great book. Enjoyable reading with a lot of reality and lifelikeness.Buy this together with Lion of Ireland and have a great time following the story of The O'brain clan."
4,Superbly written historical fiction,"Morgan Llywelyn's writing continues to be outstanding. She has transformed another piece of Irish history into a very entertaining read. The descriptions are well done without being too wordy. The action is paced nicely and is exciting. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because, while interesting, the history being related to us is simply not as fascinating as the rise to power and reign of Brian Boru (told of in Llywelyn's Lion of Ireland). Note: this book has nothing whatsoever to do with the Kennedys or bizarre witchcraft conspiracy theories."
4,How can you....?,"write a crappy review about an expansion that hasn't even been released or even announced by Mythic yet? You're probably both some 13 year old kids that think you know everything. Yes, ToA was a stupid expansion that they probably should have spent more time testing, but don't discount something before it comes out if you didn't like ToA. I'm an avid player of Daoc and have been for over 2 years now (soon I will be beta testing the next expansion for it), I've been frustrated at times, but I still get enjoyment out of the game. I'm not saying all this because I'm a fan boi, but rather because I think you should actually play the game before you give it a crappy review. I hate ToA."
4,What EQ dreams of being someday...,"Having been a long time player of EQ, and having become completely fed up with the way that game is run. I came to Dark Age of Camelot and had to pinch myself a few times to ensure I was indeed not dreaming.This game has eliminated all the worst elements of Everquest, and centered itself about the one portion of code no programmer at Sony can seem to comprehend... Player versus Player combat. In a way that makes sense and doesn't feel like the mindless butchery of Sullon Zek or Quake.Not only are the classes and realms balanced, but the game play itself is much more optimized and exciting. No mindless button pushing on endless computer generated critters. Instead you need strategy and a good comprehension of HOW to play your character.Overall the best Fantasy MMORPG I have seen, enjoyable even when you reach the highest levels, and it doesn't take months of play to get there."
1,Never trust Mythic...ever,"Look at the review of their horribly-done Trials of Atlantis. You'll know whether to purchase this or not. Oh, and if you're a new player, forget about DAOC. It will be 2 years before you'll have a character that can compete."
5,This game Rocks!!!,"I have been playing DAOC for over 2 years now. I have characters in all 3 realms and on many different servers. I will admit that Mythic has messed up at times, but they seem to always redeem them selves. TOA is ok. (Dont like the combat under water) But the graphic's upgrade was awesome. New frontiers is a blast. Especially if your a Caster or a Stalker. I am looking forward to Catacombs. From what I have seen its a huge improvement on an already GREAT game."
2,Not a very good product,"I had a different brand of this item that was very good but of course, they stopped making them. I found these online. They are sturdy, but do not stay closed. The loop comes loose & everything falls out. Not happy with this product. I would not buy these again."
5,Peter Pan Soundtrack,"This is an amazing soundtrack! I loved the movie, and I love the music. It's an ingenious mix of Trans-Siberian Orchestra-esque type music with the brilliance of James Newton Howard's creative mind. I give it 6 stars out of five."
4,Fabulous but brief and not chronological,"After seeing this fabulous movie I knew I HAD to have this score! The music is delightful and full of fantasy and beauty. My main bones to pick are that the tracks are aranged haphazardly, and that many fabulous pieces are missing! I have my fingers crossed for another album ""MORE music from Peter Pan"" but sadly I doubt this will be a reality.Favorite pieces are definitly ""Fairy Dance"", ""Set Them Free"", ""I Do Believe in Fairies"", and ""Peter Returns"".James Newton Howard is also the composer of Atlantis:The Lost Empire by Walt Disney Studios, and as with all noted composers, traces of his previous work appear in his current (this is not a bad thing!)"
2,Peter Pan CD,"The service,Product, and follow up facilities ie. tracking of order were excellent.Ten out of ten to you People. Regards Samantha."
5,Soaring score,"I saw this movie when it came out. Immediately afterward, I went to the store to get it--had to wait three weeks for it to come in, but it was totally worth it. I listened to nothing but this and the Wicked soundtrack for months. The music is so beautiful and moving--I still listen to it all the time because it's both soothing and uplifting. And it has definitely appeared on the recent Disney commercials! I was so excited when I heard it. :)"
3,Peter Pan soundtrack,"The soundtrack from Peter Pan is exactly that - a soundtrack. The music is wonderful and reminds us of the fantasy and action of the movie. What may surprise is that no effort seems to have been made to present the soundtrack as a music CD - the tracks are exactly what was used in the movie. The effect can be disorienting as we move rapidly from one scene to another with no apparent link or explanation in the music.As a reminder of the enjoyable movie, this CD is great. As music it is a little hard to follow."
5,The Absolute Best!,"I love this whole cd! My favourite has to be either Fairy Dance, I do Believe in Fairies, or Flying. I actually want to start chanting I do believe in fairies, I do! I do! Or I close my eyes and see Jeremy standing there waiting for me to dance with him. Even better yet, I look out my window and for a few quick moments see myself flying around outside with Jeremy! An Absolute astonishing production! Buy it if you want to feel the magic of the movie again and again!"
3,Beautiful!!,"This soundtrack is absolutly perfect!!All the songs are great, but my favourite is '' Fairy dance''. When I listen to it with my eyes closed, something magic happens. I fly away and dance in the sky with all the fairies around me.It's like if you were a child again, flying and having fun!!"
3,IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER,"SOUNDTRACK-CLASSICAL MUSIC COLLECTORMy disappointment with the soundtrack is not with the lyrical-mystical musical content (""fairy dance"" being the best track), but with it's short, chopped up, out of sequence 42 minutes. Nine of the tracks are under 2 minutes (4 closer to 1 minute) and 4 more are under 3 minutes. That is 13 tracks out of 19 which are so short as to hinder any proper engagement with the music score or in recalling the movie scenes. The movie's end title should have been included, but instead you are left with only a 1:42 minute track. This is not nearly enought for closure. This is a sad commentary on the show of indifference by the composer/album producer himself. He did not throw us enough crumbs to make a meal of his soundtrack, but he could have."
3,Good instruments sound affect.,"Me and my daughter enjoy the cd, but the only thing was wrong i assume the cd was going to sing word instead of instrument maybe the cd will be available soon. I'm preparing the song through out the peterpan movie."
5,The Best of the Best,"I usually don't buy instrumental CDs, but I really enjoyed the movie and needed calming music to study to. Well, I really didn't expect what I bought. The music is, to me, anything but calming. It's completely wonderful. Although hard to study to, it keeps me listening the whole time, even my mom tries to take it from me. Fat chance! This CD is all mine. The combinations of instruments create a mystical blend. You can hear each instrument carry out their part in the song and even hear each different part of the movie clearly.This is definitely not a waste of your time and hard earned money. I highly suggest it."
4,GOOD LISTENING,I bought this soundtrack for my 14 year old daughter. She had enjoyed the movie and always takes note of the music in the background. We enjoy listening to this together.Kathleen
2,It's a squeal,"pretty disappointing, the humor is here but it is rampantly misogynistic and the plot is thin and not that exciting. feel free to skip this book, the first one is much much better/"
4,Fun and Unique Magical Tale,"This was the first Xanth novel I read, back in 1980. I received it as a gift from my sister-in-law who was school librarian and getting rid of some titles in favor of newer versions.This novel combines a healthy dose of adventure, danger, and tragedy. It is one of the most unique of the Xanth novels and perhaps a but more serious than most.The scenes are magical and perhaps even could be considered psychedelic at times. It is the journey to the source of magic itself that gives readers a great understanding of how Xanth works and the dangers that lurk in its myriad corners and wide open spaces.I still recommend this novel to young adults, especially boys. It is a great and fun adventure story with a healthy dose of magic. (Reversal mo above comment intentional)."
4,Just enjoy it for what it is!,"I enjoyed this book. Served as a great book to read while on vacation by the pool sipping a drink! Ok, so I am easily entertained, but so what! I read some of the reviews and there was a lot of griping about how women were put down but I find it interesting that the women who say that don't bring up the fact that there was equal time for men!!! I mean admit it, men so weak they can't resist the call of a siren? Get kinda tired of women crying oh woe is me! Now if any of those characters were not heterosexual men, there would have been no trouble getting past the siren! The siren would have been totally ignored by any gay man unless of course if she had a fabulous gown and matching tiara! Come on people, get a life, this is entertainment and should be appreciated for the entertainment and creativity it is! Just sit back and enjoy the ride!"
3,Bink continues,"Another magical pun filled book. Bink is back, with even more adventure. Bink quest: To find the source of magic. This is not as good as the first book, but you still have dragons and Murphy. Book ends with Dor starting a quest."
5,The greatest adventure in all of Xanth.,"I LOVED this book. It is perhaps the greatest book I've ever read, most certainly the best Xanth book I've read (i've read all of them). I highly reccomend this book for Xanth fans, and for those of you who haven't read Xanth, read A Spell for Chameleon first!"
5,Why can't you give this 6 stars??,"Source of Magic: Best Xanth book ever!!! Take that back, erase ""Xanth""! This book gets better and better..I would most definitely getting this."
3,Not his best,"Eh, it was okay. I thought he has written other books that are much better, but this one was alright."
3,"Xanth, rereadible","I won'ted a book i could let my grandchildren read too, and would be rereadible, this fits. Xanth is good for all age's"
3,"Not at entertaining as chameleon, but a fine read.","This book is entertaining although it is dry at times, like the first half of the book. thequest took too much time to get into but when they finally did it was very interesting. i would definitely reccomend this book, but dont expect as much as A Spell for Chameleon gave."
1,Parents beware,"The second installment of the Xanth series has Bink searching for the source of the magical land's magic. (A quest he is sent on primarily to give him a break from his 7-8 month pregnant wife, inconveniently in her ""ugly/smart"" phase.)This story continues with the sexual themes (though not as blantant as in later books, if I remember correctly) that are geared to entice the adolescent boys who are the target audience.**Spoiler**On a further note, if you are someone concerned about the controversies sometimes found around the Harry Potter stories, be warned that the source of magic is, literally in this story, demonic in nature (as in coming from a demon)."
5,Anthony scores again,This book is so good it doesn't even need words to describe it. So I'll keep it short. The second book in Piers Anthony's Xanth series is a wonderful addition to the wonderful world of Xanth. Together again with such awesome characters as Chester Centaur and soldier Crombie Bink takes a journey to the heart of Xanth to get to the core of were Xanths magic comes from. Joined by a few new characters Bink's second adventure is just as exciting as his first.
4,Good read,"An extremely readable book. Good lighthearted atmosphere. If you want to spend some time reading a nice lighthearted story, this is the book for you.Bink is a magician, one of the most powerful beings in the world of Xanth, but his power is devious. If the range of a power is known, then someone might find ways to circumvent it. So it conceals itself from discovery and manifests only when Bink is in danger. Bink goes on a quest to discover the source of magic and enemies try to prevent him. The scrapes Bink gets into and the ways in which his power helps him without revealing itself is hilarious. Accidents happens. The accidents always favour Bink. Nice book. If you are in search for some light entertainment read this."
2,Magic's Burnout,"This second book in the Xanth saga does not deliver like its predecessor, A Spell for Chameleon. In The Source of Magic, we join Bink and company once again for a journey to find out waht makes the land of Xanth so magical. The quest itself is very boring, drawn out, and redundant. However, the answer to Bink's quest is quite interesting, and worth the read in and of itself."
3,Standard Deviants vs Shakespeare Collection,"I am trying to check out the Standard Deviants dvd/video series on Shakespeare (a study tool, I understand) but I think that the review below applies to another product (the Shakespeare Collection which is a series of performances of the plays - not a study of them)."
1,Don't waste your time with these people,For the second time I order CR 1550 and they send me CR1450 - it won't fit in your pitcher. THis just wastes everyone's time. Don't waste your time here.
2,Don't buy it: Save yourself some confusion,"I bought the EA1 edition through Foyles bookstore. Unfortunately the EA1 edition is massively out of sync with the current FCS version of the software, and the Cd didn't contain the examples (or at least not where the book said they were).So I ended up downloading the examples. The build.xml files in the download are laughably different from the book, and several steps need to be taken which the book mentions nothing of.It's a major shame since the book looked very good. But I completely wasted my 38 and have wound up using the (confusing) online tutorial.Apparently a FCS version of the book is coming out in several months. Wait for it. Assuming that they haven't changed version yet again it should be a good book. Right now it is a waste of money."
3,Terse,"This book is basically a packaging of Java XML EAE packages of what you can download from the Sun's JavaSoft site.After skimping thru it briefly, it appears to be very terse and I'm not sure if it can be said as a helpful ""tutorial"" as such for any beginning/intermediate Java Web Service learner other than showing what EAE(Early Access Edition) is all about.This book in my opinion needs to be evolved into 3 volumes:1) Basic XML parsing(SAX, JDOM)2) XML Schema & Java mappings3) Java Web Services implementation framework(HTTP, Servlet,RMI,etc).My verdict is this book is not worth its weight and price at the moment."
2,Why not just read these pages on line,"I feel sorry for sun: they have to give away so much for java to succeed, and their direct java revenue must come from J2ee licensees, JCP membership fees and books. This book is a dead-tree of the online JWSDP tutorial, with the benefit that you can read it while off line, the disadvantage that you pay for the privilege. Either way, I dont think it is that good a tutorial; it covers the Sun way of thinking, but doesnt get into the details of interop problems, maybe because SUNW dont seem to be participating in the SoapBuilders interop fests. Interoperability is the bane of and key to the success of web services, and if all you are doing is taking existing EJB beans and turning them into web services, you arent building a real web service. If you are using the Axis framework, there are better books, like the SAMS press one. No doubt something great will come along for the Sun product, but this is not, yet, it."
3,good for taller kids,We purchased this bike for our 2 year old. It was only until his 3rd birthday that he was able to touch his feet to the ground. Great indoor bike. Only sad thing was that the wood cracked on the tire area days after receiving it. Not sure why.
2,"Great For Balance, But Won't Last Long","We purchased the Skuut after reading reviews and closely examining the competition (primarily the Likeabike). First, the good: bike assembles easily, looks cute, and rides fast and true. The bad: it started falling apart within weeks, to the point of becoming completely unsafe. Our child is on the small side, just turned three, is 36 inches tall and weighs under 30 pounds. I can't imagine how a heavier child could ride one of these. As much as our child loved it, it just wasn't safe. We were able to send it back even after the 30 day period (way to go, Amazon!) and replaced the Skuut with the Kettler Sprint. Even though it doesn't look as cool, the Kettler is so much sturdier. The resale value will be higher too, since Kettler is such a well known quality kid's bike builder."
1,Junk - cheapest materials- no customer service,"The idea of a glider bike for kids learning balance is brilliant. I bought this Scuut bike. It is made out of the cheapest materials. The tires and tubes were defective. There was NO response from the Scuut customer service number which I called many times. You buy this product and you are on your own. Next I bought a Strider. There is no comparison. For effectively the same price you get a bike that is metal and made to last and has all the range of movement of a larger bike (with infinite seat and handlebar adjustments). The Skuut is just bad design and over priced for what you get (limited adjustments, cheap materials, bad design) with no support to boot."
3,Not like a REAL bike,"We bought this for my 2 1/2 year old and put it together - was quite easy to assemble. But my son keeps looking for the pedals and is disappointed that there aren't any so he keeps putting his feet all the way up and falling off balance. I would have rather purchased a normal bike with pedals and training wheels so he could feel like the other ""big kids"" around the neighborhood with their bikes. it may teach balance, but it doesnt teach to ""ride a bike"" with pedals the way normal bikes do."
2,Fun but give kids the wrong idea,My kids love to play with this bike my oldest daughter's first bike was a tricycle my sons first bike was this well my daughter knows how to peddle a bike this taut my son that you use your feet to make a bike go so now were trying to reteach him to ride a bike i wouldnt buy this unless you plan on teaching your kid to peddle a bike also
2,"""where are the pedals""","I read that this was one of the best bikes you can buy but when it arrived and I assembled it my kid was just plain confused. She wanted to know where the pedals were. I knew there were none and attempted to explain to her how it worked but she still felt the need to pedal. It just led me to believe if you get the kids started off with a trike of some sort, you don't really need a ""glider""- no matter how young."
5,Facinating First Bike,"This bike is made to last. It has a heavy laquer finish with real tires. The handle bars have a rubber bumper on each end to protect the bike when it's thrown to the ground. Also, it doesn't turn too much to the sides which is great for safety. The seat height is adjustable. I really love the tires because they don't have any pinch points like spoked wheels. My 3 1/2 year old walks it around the house. It's so cute we leave it out when company comes over.Assembly wasn't bad but the seat was tough to squeeze in to the frame."
1,Shoddy Skuut ruins Christmas,"My wife and I are attempting to assemble the Skuut Balance Bike for our 3 year old daughter and discover that it is UNSAFE. The screws holding down the handlebars don't attach to anything. They go thru the handlebars and into the forks but don't bite into the plywood at all. This item is going back. It's too bad because it is a very cute bike, and easy to assemble. Our daughter will be getting a Likeabike for her birthday instead, which fortunately is in only a week."
2,"Sadly, shoddy","Our 2 1/2 year old loves it. In a few rides he was coasting short distances and having much fun. So how do you explain to him that tomorrow his new favorite toy is disappearing and going back to the manufacturer? I'm generally pretty forgiving about minor product imperfections. These aren't minor. The Skuut arrived stinking of mothballs (the seat still smells strongly). Within less than a week, the wood bushings on the rear wheel assembly had become separated making the back wheel dangerously wobbly and unstable. Not helpful to a kid trying to learn to balance, and, I think, unsafe as the bike speeds up. Doesn't matter how fun, educational, etc. a toy is, it's useless if a kid can't play with it."
1,Tire blew---birthday not too happy!,"The front tire of this bike blew after my daughter was on it for about 20 seconds---on her third birthday! What a great way to ruin a birthday, Skuut. I've seen other reviews complaining about the tires, perhaps it's time you listen to consumers and do something about the quality of your material. I know things happen, but seriously, couldn't be more disappointed with this product. I was so excited for my daughter to ride, and now we're sitting here figuring out how to return it. Won't be recommending your company to any of my friends looking for a balance bike for their children! And can I say one more time--What a way to ruin a birthday!"
1,Too Heavey Too Cumbersome.,"I bought this when my son was 18 months old. It was so heavy that he could not balance it well at all. Also it is simply too tall for him that his feet could not touch the ground even when we lowered the seat to the bottom at 18 months old even though my son is 95% on weight and height of his age and he was quite strong. I immediately sold it and bought the ""Chicco Red Bullet"". What a difference. My son immediately got it without any couching. He was able to manipulate the Chico Red Bullet"" without any problem. He is now 3 year and 3 months old and still going strong with his little ""Red Bullet"". The price of the ""Red Bullet"" is also $30 cheaper than the Skuut. My son now is 42 lb. and 44 inches 95% of a 3-year old. The ""Chico Red Bullet"" definately was the best toy I've purchased for him. He has had so many good times in the skate board park with his little bullet, almost every weekend when the weather permits. Oh, save your money don't buy that over priced Strider."
5,"5 star product, 5 star service","My daughter loves her Skuut. She has ridden it from when she was 2 to now (She just turned 4). The rubber on the back tire started peeling away after awhile. We e-mailed the company's customer service, and within a week they sent us a replacement tire and inner tube. Kudos to Skuut for great customer service and a great product."
2,Wood cracking after one year,"We have had this bike for just over a year. It's been used by one child and stored indoors or in the garage. The wood is cracking in two places, one of which is the handlebars. With such poor durability, I just can't recommend this bike. The seat also could not be lowered enough to fit our two year old."
2,Affordable but quality mixed,"We purchased the Skuut balance bike for our 3 year old who wasn't really confident on a 'real' bike with pedals. After only about 3 weeks of use, mostly in the house, the vinyl on the seat started to wear away at the front, leaving a white patch which seemed to get larger by the week. We returned the bike for a replacement, but then the replacement arrived with a cracked wooden piece on the wheel. We returned that one as well and will now look at a more sturdy bike for our son, as this one unfortunely didn't stand up to regular 3-year old usage. He loved riding it though, and it was lots of fun, so I think it's a good concept, you might just want to buy a slightly more expensive and better built brand."
4,Great idea,The Skuut was a gift for my 2 year old granddaughter. She had an instant fassination for it and is enjoying it. I was easy to assemble. and appears to be well constructed. I like the concept of having a younger child be able to gain balance before they are able to peddle.
2,Fun but unsafe,"We got one of these for our 3 year old at Christmas last year. There is no doubt that our daughter loved it, had great fun riding it, and found it easy to move on to a regular bicycle by the end of the summer. The problem is that the material is incredily shoddy. One day while she was riding it, the entire front handlebar/wheel assembly popped completely off, sending our daughter head-first onto the pavement. Fortunately she was wearing a good helmet (which was split completely in 2) or else the outcome could have been catastropic.This is a great idea, and there may be better-quality balance bikes out there. But this particular model is just too hazardous to let your kid ride on it."
2,Broken after one month,My three year old son has had this bike a little over a month now. He's probably ridden it about ten times. The handlebars have completely ripped off from the bike. The screw holes are completely stripped so reassembling it will be a problem. I'm going to try and rig it up but this bike is just shoddy. Not durable enough for my three year old.
2,lots of fun for a short time,"My 2 year old loved his skuut until it broke - few weeks after the purchase.Since then I've been on a quest for spare parts. The costumer service at skuut has been very poor - no responding to emails, no phone number on the official website.Balance bikes are great, but next time i'd opt for a metal one."
3,A well made bike but need to be tall enough to ride it,"I bought this when my daughter was almost 2 after seeing a neighborhood boy riding it. We have her tried when she was 2, then 4 months later, but she didn't show that much interest in learning to balance in it. She was 36"" when she last tried, but her feet can barely touch the ground at the lowest possible setting for the seat. As a result, the bike tipped over easily. I'm guessing she will like it more in a few more months when she is taller and can hold up the bike well. I would recommend it to toddlers 3 and above or over 39"" tall."
4,Great for 3 year old,"A balance bike is the best toy for a three year old, bar none. My son was 2 and a half when he got it (arrived with a flat tire, got a replacement tire the day after Christmas...) and could not use it, but his 5 year old sister could and did for a few months. She transitioned to a pedal bike with no coaching/ assistance from us! My dad couldn't believe I didn't have to go through the running behind with a hand on the seat ritual of bike training. By 3 my son was big enough to use the Skuut and rides it non-stop. The front axle backed out once and certain parts of the bike are pretty scuffed up, but there have been a lot of hours logged on this bike over the last year. I'm not sure if it will survive until my youngest is old enough to use it, but if not I'll find another balance bike from Skuut or some other brand."
2,Loved it until it fell apart,We got my son this bike for his 2nd bday in February. He was a little small for it at first but started riding it about 3 months ago. He's crashed it the way that a normal 2 year would. First the wood around the handle grips started splitting. My husband duct-taped which worked fine. But the handlebars completely popped off and the wood split from the screws making it completely un-fixable after a normal fall on the sidewalk. Pretty bummed because now I'll be out another $100 replacing it with a more durable metal version.
3,Okay bungee,"These work okay, not as much stretch as I wanted but they look good and still work to keep stuff in place."
4,My husband loves these knives!,"My husband loves these Kershaw knives. He has no complaints. This one was smaller than the others he's had, but still loves it. We got this for a little more that $14 on sale!!!!"
3,Works with a little help,The phone fit is just fair. The case seems to slip when the phone is opened. Required a little jury-rigging to make it work properly.
5,Asthmatics Rejoice,"This product is perfect for people who suffer multiple chemical sensitivities as I do, and it doesn't bother my asthma in the least. I have no problem with it causing any skin irritation as I do with other fragrance free products and it doesn't bother my eyes either. When used in conjunction with Magick's fragrance free conditioner you'll get beautifully soft and manageble hair with plenty of body and shine.Warning: Magick's fragrance free conditioner has been known to cause dandruff in some skin types but I'm not sure why. I think they changed some of the ingredients because it didn't affect me that way when I first started using it 8 years ago."
5,The Perfect Shampoo,"I think this is the perfect shampoo. I began using it over 10 years ago because I am very allergic to fragrances. Not only is this shampoo completely odorless, it never causes my hair to tangle or be too soft. I have thin hair and live in a large city with hard water. There is no shampoo like this in the stores."
3,"Teacher, teacher!","On p14 he calls words 'the stuff and credence of life' (what CAN he mean?) while on the very next page 'expostulate' is misused (I just checked) - so a 'verbivore' may ingest words but doesn't always regurgitate them successfully. Same goes for derivations - one feels Lederer wouldn't know a folk etymology (linguistic 'urban legend') if it nested in his short and curlies, and anyway the internet does these things so much better nowadays (I just looked up 'spitting image'(p34) on Phrase Finder). Lederer's enthusiasm, though, is irresistible. A voice from a gentler era"
1,Lacks in quality,"These towels are not thick. They unravel and appear to be very poorly made.I just washed them and was hoping they would become more plush, but they just are not good towels. I will use them for the gym and hopefully someone will steal them."
4,Nice towels,"I'm not sure what other people were expecting. These towels are quite nice- yes they shed the first couple of time in the dryer. But they feel much softer out of the dyer than some heavier towels, are very absorbant, and pretty. I've been using them for more than a month- they seem fine, but don't know how long they will last."
3,"If you have to own one, consider a used one","This is a typical arcade game, if you want to own one for personal use I suggest you go to a leasing company who will sell you a game that has come off lease for about 1/2 its list price. Alternatively look for an arcade that is privately owned and talk with the manager about buying one or more of their least productive machines."
3,Personally...,"I'd rather just buy an actual Ford with the money it would take to purchase this. Although, it does look pretty cool :)"
5,"Little Known, But Great","A profound film about consciousness and reality. Bruno Ganz is at his best delivering a subtle and complex performance. One of the best examples of modern German cinema I know, yet hardly anyone has seen or heard of it!"
3,Could be done better,"I passed the exam 70-221 on the first try by using this book among others, it gives a fairly good preparation it covers all the topics of the exam, but I found the exam very difficult and need a lot of experience and of course this book is not enough to pass, I frequently buy exam cram for my preparation for certification exams but I found this book below average, not enough in depth in some areas, have errors and I didn't like the wording of the questions (not enough details to make a choice between 2 right answers) . I gave 3 stars for the material but this book could be done better."
2,Could be done much better,"I normally swear by the Exam Cram series. I used the CCNP series (all four books) and passed all four tests the first time. So when I went to order a book for my next test - Network Design, I got the Exam Cram one. Errors abound, half the questions don't make sense, some of the explanations are flat out wrong - The author states that a test-taking guideline is to not include anything not specified as a requirement in the case studies, then proceeds to break it in the answer to the next test case study with no explanation. This was going to be a key study, because with the Microsoft tests you have to learn the Microsoft way of viewing the topic. How MS designs networks is alien to any other network design, so what they believe is the key to passing their tests. This book failed to be clear on what MS wants their network design to be. The book covers all the topics, but it needs more explanations as to which design rules MS follows and less errors and inane questions."
4,Turn Your Shine On!,"Tonya Marie Evans' talent is a bright, steady light. Her Shine! Inspirational Poetry with Companion CD was my first introduction to the Spoken Word genre and I believe our ""acquaintance"" was meant to be. Not only did her expressive and melodic voice captivate me, but the messages in poems such as ""I Will Tell Myself,"" ""Angry Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" and ""Find Your Own Shine"" inspired me to ""begin again."" The CD was so awesome that it got my creative juices flowing and I've returned to writing poetry. Tonya Marie Evans's words will affirm, encourage, and help you to turn your shine all the way on!"
5,"Absolutely gorgeous, but fragile.","Received these as a gift, and I'd like to have the cocktail glasses that go with them - they're that gorgeous. Really beautiful to display, but the glass at the top is so thin that they have to be very carefully hand-washed - and even then we cracked one. Truly a steal at the price - style on a budget, especially if you like mid-century modern and/or Scandinavian."
1,pretty wack,hard to believe this is the same cat from 10 years back?a decade ago Snoop Dogg seemed destined for something truly Great with His Musical Career but one decade later nothing ahs changed.He seems content on living on a pop pass.this song like most of the others on His Album has that been there done that&nothing new is coming any time soon vibe&feel.
5,New Oldies,"As an older listener, I enjoyed the synthesis of cool '70s music a la Cat Stephens with upusual instrumental sounds that seem very modern. This is the kind of music you can sit and listen to or file in the background as comfortable ""tunes""; each song has an innovative flair, not hard rocking nor old fashioned droning but all very satisfying. There's a classical edge that appeals as being mucically mature, the kind of music that should stand the test of time."
3,Mediocre acid rock,"This is German band Out of Focus' second album from 1971.They were to evolve into a jazzy prog-rock band but here have a more basic psych-prog approach.At times they sound quite a bit like old Pink Floyd but jazzier with lots of sax and flute.There is heavy use of organ and most of the songs are well-written with nothing too outstanding to report.Some of the songs are quite sedate,but the first one has quite a bit of energy to it.My favorite Out of Focus Cds are:Rat Roads and Not Too Late which were never released on album and were from 1972 and 1974.On those they are much more jazz-rock oriented.Most of the music on the Out of Focus album I frankly find uninspiring to be honest.If you want to discover some German Cosmic rock gems from the early 70's check out both Eiliff albums and both Brainstorm albums.You will not be disappointed."
4,"Historical, partly-fictional, story of Haymarket Riot.","Frank Harris gives a wonderful account of the Haymarket Square Riots with one of the greatest, most idealistic love stories as a subplot. Throughout this book I felt truly inclined to believe just how incredible the hero of the novel is. It introduced me to the ideas of socialism and put thoughts in my mind that perhaps the bombing was justified. Either way, this is a fascinating book that should be given the time and chance to be read."
5,No Perfect Christmas,This is an excellent Christmas movie and different than other ones. The closest I can get when you consider that the family is disfuntional is Holiday in Handcuffs but the family in that movie wasnt this bad. The main characters favorite holiday is Christmas. Its mine too but nevermind. Anyway she dreams of the perfect Christmas and this snowglobe she recieves litterly takes her there. Later she has to choose between her true love who is her neighbor and a guy from her Christmas fantasy.And she has to learn that sometimes Christmas isnt perfect. Thats a lesson Im still trying to learn.
4,"Christmas, Comedy and Romance","""Snowglobe"" is the story of a young woman, Angela, played by Christina Milian, searching for the perfect Christmas. Trapped in her contentious family she follows her dreams into the Christmas village in her Snowglobe. Finding the Snowglobe village full of attractive but one dimensional characters she comes to view her own world differently. When the Snowglobe people follow her into her city the comedy really takes off. Ultimately they all find, like Dorothy, ""There is no place like home."""
5,snowglobe,"It doesn't hurt to have a little fantasy in life, especially as presented in a sweet, family styled movie that also displays the real life hassles that prompts the fantasy. Christina Milian is a gifted, charming young actress with real life similarites to the character she portrays in the movie. We consider it a Christmas classic."
5,I love this movie,"It is one of my favorite movies, I've been watching it since it aired a few years ago on ABC Family. It was worth the money and I didn't have to wait very long to receive it."
1,PAINFUL TO WATCH,"This movie had a nice idea but either the writer didn't carry the plot all the way through or the director held everyone back. Ever watch someone try to dance and you just know they're counting out their footsteps? Well, that's what this movie felt like. The characters never really clicked and the plot just fell apart. Anyone over the age of 6 will probably not want to see it."
5,snowglob,this is a very nice christmas movie to watch at christmas time it has very nice story to it i enjoy this movie very mutch ill ad this to my movie colletion.
2,Too cheeky for me!,I bought this movie after reading the other reviews here. I am always searching for decent Christmas movies to buy. This one was on the unbelievable side. Main subject of movie gets transformed into the antique snow globe to find a perfect world where the inhabitants live perfect lives. I guess I lean more to the Christmas feel good movies that are more beleivable.
3,Comfortable but lace-ups defeat purpose of mules,"I have had 2 pairs of skechers mules in the past and have loved them because you just slide them on and go. They were always comfortable and durable.I ordered these thinking they would be the same. In terms of fit and comfort, they are just like my others.However, the lace-up nature of the shoe defeats the purpose of the mules --- just being able to slide them on and go. If you try to just slide them on, then the tongue slips down and bunches up -- making an uncomfortable lump on the front of your foot. I wind up untying and tying them every time I go to put them up to make sure the tongue is positioned properly. Unfortunately, that means it takes about as much time to put these shoes on as it does for an ordinary ""full pair"" of shoes.Overall, I'm satisfied -- particularly since the price was excellent. However, I'll have to buy another pair in a different style to just slip on and go."
5,Skechers Mules,"Very comfortable, but I read some other reviews about sizing before I ordered mine that said that Skechers runs 1/2 size small. I ordered 1/2 size larger than usual and they are, no surprise, 1/2 size too big. But with heavy socks in the cold mid-Atlantic winter, they'll be perfect."
4,Skecher Athletic Mules,"Bought these for work. I HATE Crocs, they are so ugly! I wanted some cute work shoes to wear with my scrubs that I could just slip on and off. These shoes are extremely cute and comfortable."
5,luv these shoes,Its too bad these are discontinued because they are the best slip on shoes. You must size up though at least one full size because they are narrow. I did and even though I have a wide foot I have no problem now with the larger size.
4,"Great shoes, fast shipping- the laces are not good, however","These are nice shoes, but the tie up laces are a pain. The tongue bunches up and you can't slip them on easily without untying, defeating the purpose of a slip on shoe. Suggestion: Make the laces decorative only and make the tongue stationary, part of the shoe."
3,The shoe itself is just fine.,"The shoe is fine. I personally would like something without such a clunky sole, but that is difficult to find and not pay a fortune."
4,nice shoe,I was having a hard time finding a mule style work shoe and this fits the bill. They are fairly comfortable and look nice.
3,comfy Skechers,"I had been looking for a slip on sneaker for a while. Knew that I like the Skechers but refused to pay more than $50.00 for sneakers!I like this shoe. However, you do have to adjust the tongue each and every time you slide your foot in. The tongue is not stationary. Other than that...good stuff."
2,Duh!,"There is absolutely nothing new here for anyone who has been doing this work for a year or more. All I ask when I buy a business book is ONE GOOD IDEA. I can't say I got even that with this book, despite the provocative title."
1,I have nothing to Say because this Book has nothing to Tell,this is the worst book i've ever read. wasted my money and time. the author has no ORIGINAL thoughts and stole all the ideas and comments. TERRIBLE BOOK.
3,Good Book,"I would recommend this book to anyone that will ever do any type of marketing. There were a few things that bored me but overall the book was a good book, and at times I found myself thinking why didn't I think of that. I think the author had a ton of great points but I also think that he is wrong when he says that your marketing sucks unless it is making money. From your marketing you will still get brand awareness and people will think to buy your brand."
4,Make your markting department accountable,"It's a simple premise, but one which can't be emphasized enough - don't spend money unless you can quantify the results. As someone who has worked in both large and small operations, I can vouch for the author when he says most businesses are spending marketing money because they have to - if only to keep their budgets up for the next quarter - rather than because the marketing is increasing their business. That kind of sloppy planning is exactly what is wrong with most marketing today - from superbowl campaigns to the ubiquitous calendars you get at the dry cleaners. This book has a few tired phrases (extreme marketing? - can we stop being extreme please) but it is a valuable blueprint for holding your marketing department accountable for sales."
1,do NOT SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT,"This man just went on national televison and referred to a bunch of hard working American women as ""terrorist"" His product is a bunch of garbage with out a single original idea. As a New Yorker who lived through two actual terrorist attack I find him very offensive and clueless. Do not waste your money on this book."
1,A complete waste,"I bought this book over the weekend out of curiousity despite the bad reviews on amazon.com. After the first two chapters, I stopped. I returned it to the bookstore and got my money back. I should have paid attention when the titled screamed, ""I need attention, buy me!""The only purpose of this book to generate sales with its title (smart? maybe). Bottomline is that it offers no real value (Stupid? definitely). Save your money and go with your gut instinct. Any business person with worth, will know that marketing starts with examining what the ROI will be."
2,Much better marketing books out there,"Ross Perot is a billionaire Biz man. Success doesn't mean he would be a good prez. There are a few good ideas and suggestions in the book. Not much is new or innovative. I am a mulit-millionaire as I suppose Mark Stevens is also. In my business I would only find about 3% of this book useful. If it is about Coke, Pepsi, Tide or IBM it's all same rhetoric. If your trying to establish yourself selling Bridles, Trowels, Carpet Cleaning,Frame Shop, Gas Station, Tile Adhesive, RV camp ground or branding a name in an niche industry you would be hard pressed to view this as a helpful book."
1,"I was ""suck""-ered","My biggest problem with this book is that it tells you nothing you can't already figure out if you have any kind of common sense and the ability to step back from your marketing plan and give it an objective once-over. Maybe it deserves some credit for that, but for all the hype that the first couple of chapters generate (in some cases ad nauseum), there's absolutely no way that anything that follows could possibly deliver on the promise. This in itself may be a good lesson on Mark Stevens. I picked up this book because I saw a lot of local press on it and the title was intriguing, but that's all it did. I think Stevens is teaching us suckers who bought the book that it really is all about style rather than substance.I'd suggest forming a 12-step program for others who were similarly conned but I think we all know better. Someday we'll wise up and realize that no one who writes a book like this really knows anything except how to promote themselves."
3,Your marketing might suck. This book doesn't.,"Come on, folks. The title alone is a lesson in marketing. And for the small businessman especially (though not exclusively), it should be a wake-up call. Because 9 times out of 10, small business marketing does suck. I know, because I'm often called upon to fix it. Is the book basic? Does it offer a lot of ""review material?"" Sure. So what? If you've never studied the basics, it's not review. It's a long-overdue look at some fundamentals. And Mark Stevens offers some entertaining war stories combined with some really solid examples of marketing that quite simply doesn't suck."
1,No worth your time,"I thought perhaps this book would offer some insight as to best marketing practices. What I discovered was a book targeted to individuals who know nothing about marketing.If you are not a marketing expert, I highly suggest that you read other marketing books as well. Especially one with real case stuies. How can you recommend marketing tactics without actually having some experience?"
2,Simple,"I bought this book during my summer holiday, and as a student with some marketing experience I found it quite funny at first, as there were some nice 'examples' of how not to do it. But after a while the author was just repeating himself.You could summarize this entire book in one breath: ""Do not engage in any marketing activities that do not have a positive NPV."" Something that someone with the slightest bit of common sense could conclude.The cover however was brilliant as it did exactly what it was supposed to do, draw my attention."
4,It makes you think!,"Stevens book doesn't provide a lot of answers and it is a bit general, but in this day and age there are no easy answers or road maps. What the book does is make you think. The point is to get you to examine what you're doing, how you're doing it and what your expectations are and should be. Stevens doesn't ask all the right questions, but if this book doesn't make you want to examine your marketing strategy you probably need to find another line of work!"
1,"Central theme is ""His Thinking Sucks""","Woo hoo... if Mark thinks people will fall for that comment from ""Tampa"" where they supposedly ""saved"" $250,000, he is really insulting readers intelligence. No ""real"" reader would make that comment- pure ""Markster speak."" Nor would a real company know the results by now.Then the thank you notes to himself. Thank YOU, Mr. Stevens, get real!!Grow up Mark. Your book is speaking loudly and clearly, your marketing sucks. Palid attempts to buttress up your rating here with phony positive reviews is really pushing it.Instead, post some positive ROI case studies, some testimonials from a client that you have kept for more than six months."
1,Your Marketing Sucks - Mark Stevens,Your Marketing Sucks. Catchy title. Here is my review. The Book Sucks as well. Sorry. Don't waste your time on this one.
1,Your Marketing Sucks And So Does Your Writing,"This book is nothing more than the ravings and rantings of a lunatic with a massive ego and no original ideas. Starting with the title, this book continues to show examples of why people waste millions of dollars marketing every year, except the author does not show an example of how he has really succeeded where others failed. Maybe this is due to the fact that delusional behavior is easier to write about then reality. Save your money for a good book."
4,A guide of what not to do.,This book gives great examples of how many companies forget the basic laws of differentiation. Instead they try to look alike and follow each other like sheep in the wrong direction.Big corporate thinking can affect businesses of all sizes where the true targets of sales growth and profits are overshadowed by ego and complacency. The focuses on sales growth and profits will encourage you to synergize / leverage your marketing plan to get a stronger whole that the sum of its parts.Entertaining read that will stimulate you to keep focused on marketing that has impact to set you apart from your competition.
1,Learned Nothing - Simple as that!,"This book is nothing but endless ranting by an individual who has no real experience in marketing. He bases marketing plans off of crazy ideas and can not prove any ROI to justify them.Would you trust this person and his company to market your business? I think not!The book is all hype, just to make money. Sad. he has no appreciation for the marketing world at all. Don't waste your money or time on this book."
3,Routine Western,"There is nothing exceptional about this western. The writing style is above average, but the plot has the usual western elements with few surprises. Giles A. Lutz has done better."
3,Bummer!,"I was hoping the sound quality would be better but it's simply a reissue, NOT a remaster.If you have the original, save your money.It does come with the lyrics though, which is something the original didn't have."
5,"Yes it's true, another 5 star review","Yes, if you like Yes you'll like this disc. This album is a very unique portrait painted by two very talented musicians who were at the top of their craft during this time. Jon has never sounded better and the combination with Vangelis is magical on this disc. Get a copy of this music immediately unless of course...you're allergic to good music."
5,Great CD - Great Cause - Great Value,This is the second compilation done to support the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Awsome set of tunes! Don't miss it!!
5,Cat Soup turned my brain to soup,"Wow, that was all I could say after watching this! Possibly the best film to ever be imported, you can't even tell if the strange animations are you severely hallucinating or just the movie. The twists and turns and morphing creatures of this film are absolutely bazaar. I can't even explain how neccesary it is that any person who is a fan of film- anime or not- see this work. Spectacular!"
4,Wonderfully entertaining nonsense.,"This is one of those movies where ""you'll never guess what happens next"".The animation is nothing amazing, but flows smoothly and is still amazing in what this movie shows you. The symbolism is everywhere and quite beautiful.The box says its ""hello kitty on acid"" and its right. Mushrooms aren't that intense or random and salvia doesn't last as long as this movie does. It is a trip. A movie that I have seen none other like it. Even the credits at the end are designed to mess with your head.The movie is not fast paced but the scenery changes fast enough after the 1st 10 minutes that if you get bored, watch it for another minute and things will change. No dialoge. towards the end, they lay the symbolism on you pretty thick, but it's still beautiful."
2,Except......,"The fact that Picasso was an ANARCHIST, and a pacifist is completely missed.Considering Picasso claimed Barcelona (an anarchist stronghold) as his home town, and he was the founding editor of a strongly outspoken anarchist and separatist journal when he was barely out of his teens, this is a pretty big miss.For a good resource that does cover Picasso's obvious Kropotkinesque anarchism, tryRe-Ordering the Universe: Picasso and Anarchism, 1897-1914"
5,Keeps the sun's rays off,"I live in Arizona where the sun is out most of the time and is quite intense. I use this product while running daily and while hiking. It goes on well with a good coverage and keeps my skin from exposure to harmful rays. I've been using Total Block for a few years and have noticed that despite my skin's exposure to the sun, I have not gotten any brown spots or sun damage (as I did when I was younger). Good product, good price."
5,"Fallene Total Sun Block SPF 60 Tinted, 2 fluid ounces","I appreciate that the product came right on time and was exactly what I had ordered.For a number of years I have used this product on my face at the advice of my dermatologist as a way to block the sun and so to slow down dramatically the aging process on my skin. I love the fact that it tints my skin so that the color on my face is evened out.I hope that they make this product forever. It is a great product. I think that more women would use it if they knew how great it is. I have used it for at least 8 years, I started in my early sixties and other women will ask me how I keep my skin so wrinkle free. I tell them that I believe that it is from the Fallene Sun Block at least, in part.Thank you!Carol K."
5,Relyable and Believable.,"I have been using Total Block since this product appeared on the market. My dermatologist recommended to me at that time. I have eczema and aging spots. Shake it well. Drop it on your palm and rub your both palms together. And then the both palms on your cheeks to put it on your face. By using your all surface of the hands ( from figures to palms ), it doesn't get heavy feeling or make your face whiter in color. I usually wait 60~120 second before applying my foundation. I have never had any skin problem by this sun protection."
2,"Total Block and rosacae , not a good mix","Unfortunately Total Block did not work well with my rosacea sensitive skin. It caused my skin to become very red and irritated by the end of the day. I don't doubt this is an excellent sunblock, just not for my rosacea sensitive skin. I use it now on my arms with no problems.I do feel it is very expensive for so little product so will not repurchase ."
3,Not for me,"I really like Fallene's other products but this one is a bit chalky for me becasue I have to lighten it so much. I will continue to use the other full spectrum tinted product, however. I prefer the tubes! Bring the tubes back!"
2,White face paint?,"I bought this sunscreen at the insistance of my mother who was just diagnosed with skin cancer on her face. I am naturally quite tan and she is not. So after applying it I looked like I had a significant chalky hue to my face and my face was much whiter than my neck and arms. It did not ""sink in"" no matter how much I tried to rub it in. It did not apply well on my kids faces either. So I gave that to my mom. I switched to Neutrogena Ultra Sheer dry touch SPF 70. It works very well with all of us and was recommended by my dermatologist. I did also buy Fallene Cotz SPF 58 (a slight deal if you buy it together with Total Block) and it also does not rub in but I will use it on my kids until it runs out since it doesn't burn their eyes."
5,great defense against damaging rays of sun,It comes with colors so you can customize the tint to match your skin tone. It provides much needed protection at our mile above sea levelelevation.
2,Does'nt feel good on the face,"This product feels like grain on the face, I don't care for that feel. They should improve that. Other wise I suppose it does the job."
4,good coverage with tint,"Once you master the mixture of color and blend in with moisturizer, this product blends in well and is like having a foundation on.Just a dab goes along way. Too much and you get a pasty look."
2,Sun Block that does not block.,We used this product today and found that we still received sun burns and that the product has a foul odor. I would not recommend it.
5,Works great!,"My doctor highly recommended this product and I think it works great.Fallene Total Block UVA/UVB Complete Full Spectrum Sun Protection, SPF 65 Clear, 2 fl oz (59 ml)"
2,not clear,"My face burns very badly, I have tried just about every sunblock out there and still burn just different degrees of it. I bought SPF 65 Total Block because it had good reviews here and thought I had finally found my answer. It did keep me from burning better than other products but it did not go on clear as stated I am fair skinned and when applied it went on with a white tint and this isnt acceptable to me as I deal with the public in my profession. I wont purchase this product again."
1,INEFFECTIVE They've changed the formula!,"I've been using Fallene Total Block UVA/UVB clear SPF 65 sunblock for a few years. I was so happy to have discovered this product since I was allergic to most other sunscreens. I recently ordered a bottle again and I used it once. I GOT SUNBURNED! I couldn't believe it, because it used to be totally effective. I compared the ingredients to my old bottle and the active ingredients have changed. Very disappointing. I have switched to Blue Lizard for sensitive skin and I like it but it's only SPF 35 not 65."
4,Great!!!,"Bought this for my wife and she loves it, she was able to match it perfectly to her skin tone. The product comes with 2 additional bottles so you can make clearer or darker and get just the right tone. My wife always complained of other products been too oily or just melting away under the sun. With this one here skin is absolutely dry. Will definately be getting more."
4,Good Sunblock,Found this highest rated on Consumer Reports so ordered it. Was not too thrilled with it. Regular ones are OK too.
2,Too Dry,"I purchased this as I do most Amazon products--based on the reviews. Unfortunately this product was too thick to spread on my face, even when I moisturized first, mixed moisturizer with the product, applied to a wet face,added water, nothing would evenly distribute the ""cream"" on my face, rendering it useless."
3,Strangely compelling but depressing,"I had heard a lot about this writer and this was my first foray into his work. I was immediately struck by the 'Australianness' of Winton's voice -that peculiar empty and isolated feeling, which brought to mind images and memories of my childhood in a very vivid way. The story-telling was compelling and masterful but the overall feeling was one of a complete and engulfing depression - so much so that it became a struggle to finish and when I did I was disinclined to seek out any more of his writing."
3,Down Under Down Under,"It's oddly nice to know North America is not the only country with teenagers doing bad things, husbands beating their wives, and that white trash is not just a phenomenon here in the States. Nevertheless, how much of that can you enjoy while reading? Winton is a solid, good writer; clearly a wonderful observer and recorder of modern west Australia. There is little beauty in the worlds he creates, but that may be what some readers are looking for: the uncovering of truths, the guts and grime of a specific type of everyman/woman."
5,A Very Thoughtful Collection,"Some of the stories are only four star, and that says a lot about the standard to which I hold Tim Winton. ""Only four star."" I've been writing for years and publish three-star work sometimes. This collection, meanwhile, is five stars overall.This is a collection of thought-provoking stories which are loosely linked, always excellent, always natural, never showy or forced, always observant, and a pure pleasure to read. He's such a gifted author that you're actually not always aware of how gifted he is."
3,Prophecies of Doom,"Trejan Farmer is a man with a past, a dangerous and deadly past that haunts his every waking moment. Attur is a young village boy destined to become a legend and he will clash with King Sevak who is doomed by prophecy. All three struggle with the fates that have been laid before them, prophesied long ago to shape the world created in Forrest Taylor's new novel. A challenging read with an a cast of interesting characters and places."
3,Thought provoking,"I have used the film for my class on gender roles. The college students did not find in riveting, but it sparked a lot of good discussion. Would also be good for a upper level high school class."
4,"Would have given it five stars, but...","Tilda: brilliant. Sol Rubinek: brilliant. The kid: believable, touching. Cautionary portrait of a low-bottom drunk: brilliant. Minus one star? It went on way too long. I'm almost afraid to go to sleep tonight after watching this endless nightmare. Talk about nasty, skanky, insane. Yep, it's a groaner. Still, the acting is tour de force and you don't want to miss it. Just beware: you WILL be appalled. Remember ""Deep Crimson""? It was beyond vile, but you couldn't look away. (Actually, this one isn't QUITE that bad, but it's up there.)"
3,Sorta long,I am a big fan of Tilda Swinton and she is excellent in this but the storyline gets a bit convoluted. I give the star three stars.
4,Tilda Swinton- enough said...,"Tilda plays Julia, an alcoholic who manages to scrape by day-to-day. When she encounters her neighbor at a AA meeting, a plan is hatched between them to kidnap her neighbor's son, who lives with his rich grandfather for ransom. However, Julia has plans of her own and double-crosses her neighbor for more money. As you might expect, things don't go as Julia planned, and she gets deeper and deeper in legal trouble.Tilda accurately depicts the life of an alcoholic and the self-destruction and chaos that goes with that lifestyle. Swinton is one of this generation's best actors, and it is a lot of fun to watch her become rabid in this role. In this role she is at times extremely selfish, other times very tender in her interaction with her kidnapped victim.She is also great in ""Young Adam""."
1,"SORRY, I DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.","I stuck it out and watched the entire movie. I did not like anything about it at all. I was waiting for it to get better and it just got worse. Then, I thought, maybe the ending will be great. No,l that sucked too."
3,good actress,This was not the best movie I've seen. Tilda is a great actess - that is why I bought this DVD.
2,Julia,"Tilda Swinton was great.For me,this thing went on far too long.Obviously inspired by Cassavete's Gloria. By the end I wasn't quite sure what it wanted to be,But I was falling asleep.Didn't care about any of these characters."
5,Fools Gold,"This book is about Vanessa who moves from Pau Pau New Guinie. She is staying the summer with her cousin Hannah and her uncle. She gets a job working for her uncle, and she finds herself in debt. She pays it off and tries to be like all the other California kids. she gets into drinking and forgets about God,but then after alll the tempation she finds God again! I would recomend this book to all my friends."
3,Living the Life of Luxury,"This story is about a girl whose parents are missionaries, and she goes and stays with her rich family. She realizes how money is not something you would want to deal with financially. Her rich cousin and her aunt take her shopping and get her new stuff. It turns her into a completely different person. She goes to some parties with her cousin and then her parents come back. Before they do she has turned back to her normal self. They end up moving to where she was staying that summer.My favorite part was when she finally decided that money was not fun to deal with. People who have issues with ""always wanting more"" should read this book because there are lessons to be learned from it. I did have questions like, ""How is she going to pay off the debt that she owes to the store?"" I found out she got a job and paid them all off."
1,Dissapointed,"I was rather dissapointed with this purchase. Although it was delivered in a timely manner, the book was filthy and not only smelled like mold, but looked like the pages had mold on them. I ended up throwing it away and will purchase a new one for my daughter."
5,great,"The way to make sure your conections are good. Great! I am glad they had it ,I have an older vehicle ."
4,Great Educational Tool,This 60 page book provides aspiring latin scholars with the chance to understand and translate an important part of history. With it's glossary and included grammar helps a student with three years of latin should find this an interesting and exciting piece of authentic literature.
1,"No thanks, Hate Mom","I have read a few excerpts of this book online. From what I can tell, it is filled with inconsistencies, errors in geography and history and relies on bogus conspiracy theories to justify the war.However, the biggest reason I won't read or ever own this book is because of the title. Cindy Sheehan has been quoted as saying she'd like to go back in time to murder the president, which I guess in her deluded mind, would ensure her son would survive. Does that sound like a 'Peace Mom'? Not to me. Anyone who says such an immature and treasonous statement does not need to be taken seriously by anyone. I personally have no use for this 'Hateriot'."
1,I Dont get it?,"What happened to her and the thousands of people affected by this is terrible, But im still not sure why she isnt protesting against the people who beheaded her son?...umm...even if you dont agree we should be in war. there are hundreds of organizations out there trying to end this hatred but she chooses to use her testimony to turn people against the U.S.! Way to make peace Cindy!"
1,a mentally ILL Woman!,"it's one thing to mourn the loss of your son...it's another to act like a complete nut case and align yourself with the most disgusting people on the face of this earth (Hugo Chavez). I have to agree she is a puppet for the communist left (Hugo Chavez). I guess some of the soldiers in her son's unit have stated ""Cindy's son would be totally ashamed of his mom."" If I had to guess, I would say she is a 60's hippie protester burn-out!In short, support the war or NOT --SAVE YOUR MONEY on this one!"
1,Mom makes a buck,Just another example of this woman attempting to make a buck from her sons death. Reminds me of some of the widows from 9/11. It's a shame she is so controlled by other people.Don't purchase this it will be a waste of time.I am so over this crazy woman.
5,Beautiful display of Latin music !!,"Having never heard of Chetes before,one of my fellow workers downloaded his copy of this album onto my computer, and a few minutes into the first few songs; I was totally blown away by the beautiful catchy melodies and lyrics to his music,so I ended up ordering it immediately.It was just a no brainer..Take a dash of The Beatles and Oasis and of course..that unique latin flavor,then blend them all with his beautiful pitched voice and what you get is a wonderful album full of hooky choruses and melancholic tunes that are just a joy to anyone's ears.You may also want to check ""Anoche"" by Babasonicos,""vida de perros"" by The Bunkers and ""Memo Rex Commander.."" by Zoe.They're all also excellent Latin Rock albums.Bottom line : Make sure not to pass up on this wonderful and must-album by Chetes.It'll be a wonderful addition to your Rock collection..."
3,Interesting Blend,"in Spanish of Beatles ( ELO , World Party ) , Mott the Hoople , Oasis , and spanish Icons as Enanitos Verdes and Café Tacuba ... Interesting , but as Juanes ( full of Crowded House ) not 2 Original ..."
4,Book Project Review,"This book is an excellent source for information on new biotechnology. It offers creative and comprehensive diagrams, details and models of innovative and improved research accomplished not only in the United States but also across the world. Additionally, it provides findings on gene therapy, bioelectronics and protein engineering. Even presenting great insights of the usage of biotechnology in the past, present and future.The author writes in a clear, understanding, step- by- step manner that allows the reader to focus on the topic being discussed and take pleasure in it as well. By reading this book you are discovering a world of science and enabling yourself to further comprehension of biotechnology."
4,Very Good Read,"I was pleseantly surprised when reading this book. These days, books are so carelessly put together with no thoughts of keeping the reader engaged. ""Things In Between"" kept me engaged. I routed for Cameron and felt his pain...and the ending....you will not be disappointed. Good book, Nathanial!"
4,Things In Between,I loved this book... It highlighted the struggles of a young man... It was very intruiging and captivating... The main character is very relatable and the reader becomes lost in the story.
4,frogs and toads,I think this book is easy to use.There are many frogs in this book.Also there are are about 200 pages in this book. this book tells you about tadpoles.Also tells you about their tongue.this book is for all age groups.
5,Great Gift,Ordered this as a GIFT for my new husband. He was pleased that I was able to locate this publication.
5,High Sierra Route II,I have the original copy of SHR in the Sierra Club tote book series. I enjoyed this update with photographs though I prefer the smaller format of the original. Great read and better guide book.
1,26.99 for a 17.00 retail product?,I can buy this product for cheaper on Mac website or in store. Why would one want to pay nearly $10 more?!
2,melted,"I give this item 2 stars because I like MAC. But this item from this seller was shipped USPS and by the time I got home and took it out if the mailbox it was completely melted and had leaked out if its container. I did not use the concealer, I threw it away."
3,Meh...,"This does not conceal anything. When used under the eyes it tends to emphasize the wrinkles. It is great for editing your artificially constructed eyebrows and highlighting facial features. The product blends away very nicely. If I purchase this again, this will be all that I use it for."
5,LOVE this concealer!,"This is a must have concealer for me. It's not heavy or ""cakey"" compared to some of the other concealers I have tried in the past. The shipping was ultra fast and price was right for the product. I do have to admit I wish it concealed zits a little bit better, but in overall, a very excellent product. I will buy again in this packaging vs, the stick version."
4,Good book to learn from,"It is a good book for a beginner learning traditional chinese. The use of sentence patters and drills really helps to develope grammer. You really need a teacher for this book to make sure you are saying the correct pronounciation. It is an old book, but great to learn off of. Like most chinese books there are always discrepencies in a few characters."
5,Great series!,Such a strange twist and just love the series!!! Had to share with my sister in another state. We both love the series!!
4,A Vietnamese Kitchen: Treasured Family Recipes,"This is a great book for a Native born Vietnamese who has been in the US for 30 years like me. I don't know how to cook Vietnamese food but love to eat Vietnamese food and this book helps my meal preparing task a lot easier. I love how the author puts in lots of research and insights on the Vietnamese cultures. It is fascinating, even for a Vietnamese like me. Great job, Mrs. Ha Roda!!!!"
5,Service review,The book arrived on time and in excellent condition as advertised. What more could you want?
2,"Entre Hierba, Polvo y Plomo",its wack lame i thought it would be better ...i want my money bak lol just playing but yeah didnt like it dat much
4,GOOD MAN IN A STORM,BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND LYRICS. KEITH HAS INCORPORATED JAZZ AND BLUES WITH CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN LYRICS THAT WILL INSPIRE TODAY'S YOUTH AND REJUVINATE THOSE OF US OVER THE HILL!
1,Don't waste your money,"The remote didn't work as I had hoped it would. It's just not a reliable remote for even the simplest setup.For example, I programed the remote to work with my DVR. When trying to fast forward through the commercials, I was often unable to get the touch screen to react fast enough to stop at the desired point. This caused a lot of unnecessary frustration.The remote seems like it isn't quite production ready. I would consider the Logitec Harmony instead."
3,Almost...,"I am on an eternal quest for the perfect family oriented universal remote. I bought the RC9800i hoping it would be that. Not quite. I works perfectly, does exactly what it is made to do, but still a little confusing for my wife and a little too odd shaped for me. And, there is no place for the stylus on the remote...who the heck engineered that??"
1,The RC9800I will not even control its own products,"I got the remote on Dec 7th and it ships back to where I bought it on December 11th.It will not control their own DVD player (DVD 5140)it will not turn off devices after they are used when you switch to something else.I have had most of the remotes costing over 500.00 and am a pro installer and remote programmer.I promise you, you will not like this remote. I have no clue how and why Philips thought they could bring this remote to market as they have.What a waste.Remember also that you have to use 2 hands to operate this remote, not like the 700, 900 960 from universal. may sound strange but 2 handed operation is cumbersome, but must be expected with a touch screen.disclamer: use at your own risk. this is fair warning"
4,Works as it says it will,"This product works very well within its limits of customization. I have a projector and it requires you to press the power button twice to turn off, and the all off command for this unit only presses it once. So make sure you are aware of this limitation if you have a device with a similar configuration. Other than that it works great. I am able to access pictures and mp3's from the remote through the wi-fi. It is not a one hand operation though, but most remotes of this nature are made to be that. Battery life is a little lacking, but as long as you put it back on its charging station each night you should be fine."
2,Skip it. Buy RealHula,"1. The cameraman is in too close and consistantly cuts off her feet and sometimes her hands...and you are supposed to be learning by watching? Post production they must have realized the mistake and occssionally insert a little box showing her feet in the lower corner of the picture...now you have to watch two things...the box for feet and the main screen for arm movements.2. There is absolutely no mention of how to hold your hands...you are supposed to learn by watching.3. I've taken one hula lesson on Kauai and the Kumu (teacher)stressed that you need to understand the words of the song and the way they are expressed with the hands. Telling a story is the whole point of hula. This is barely touched upon in this DVD.4. This is a very superficial program. Buy the RealHula DVDs.The instruction as given is clear, the scenery beautiful, the dancer beautiful and talented..."
5,Excellent! - An elevator brings them to another world!,This book was a great book. Its about these two kids who find out there is a thirteenth floor on an old building. When they enter they find themselves fighting pirates and the boy finds himself trying his best to help his sister who has been accused of being a witch! This book always pushed me to turn the page. It is an easy reader but fun to read.
4,The Days of Pirates and Witches,"The 13th Floor is not so much a ghost story as it is a story of time-travelling adventure. Twelve-year-old Buddy and his sister Liz (a grown-up lawyer) lost their parents to a plane crash and are about to lose their house in order to pay off their father's debts when Buddy, acting on an old family legend, calls on one of their ancestors, the fierce pirate Captain Crackstone. A ghostly voice on their answering machine directs Liz and Buddy to the 13th floor of an office building. Once they each find their way there, they tumble through time to the year 1692. It will take all of their cleverness to get themselves back home again. A fantastic historical adventure, even if the book's present time feels a little dated now."
3,The 13th Floor,The book The 13th Floor written by Sid Flieshman was good. The story was a mystery. Also it was good because it was a ghost story. I didn't like the story because it was very predictable. Over all the book was ok. I wouldn't recommend this book to a frien
4,Qaint Read,"Washington Square by Henry James is a good story which I bought for an English College class. I didn't particularly like how most of the story was concentrated on the home setting of the ""Washington Square"" part of town, but hey that's what the book is called right? For those wanting a slow but interesting classic read I recommend it."
3,Sad Story,This was a sad story of a women torn between the two men that she loved. Her controlling father did not like the man that she wished to marry. He felt that he was only after her money and tried to keep them apart. The poor women suffered dearly trying to do the right thing. It was very disheartening.
3,Review of Washington square,"I think this story is relatively good. It has a good point about a good wish of parents that we should obey them. The story has interesting written style and makes me want to foolow till the end. However,it has a weak point that the end is predictable."
4,Quite Complex for a Novella,"This book by Henry James is as different as can be from his longer works, but it has its own charm. The charactization is quite complex for a novella. It's just unfortunate that Catherine is so unredeemably staid. I realize that quite a few women chose to live a life alone in those days, but she seemed quite plodding to me. She does develop into a spinster that seems to enjoy that state. And Morris is quite the cad, but we the readers are never in any doubt as to that. The doctor father is another story, He's so right-minded that it's difficult to imagine anyone could be that stubborn. And the widowed aunt is a treasure - silly, manipulative and oh so romantic. This novella is written like a play since there are only four main characters, and most of the action takes place in the house on Washington Square. I really think this book looks deceptively simple, but it is not as simple as it appears. I enjoyed the story."
3,A Disowned (by the author) Early Novella from Henry James,"""She confessed that she was not particularly fond of literature. Morris Townsend agreed with her that books were tiresome things; only, as he said, you had to read a good many before you found it out. He had been to places that people had written books about, and they were not a bit like the descriptions.""I had no idea that Henry James was so snarky. This book was pretty insufferable, but I have to give it props for standing the test of time, even if in effect all that means is that its four annoying main characters are just as annoying now as they were 130 years ago.This book does offer some choice bits about how Manhattan gentrified from Dutch farm country to a sophisticated urban environment during the 1800s. Did you know, for instance, that people used to say ""the Fifth Avenue"" and ""the Second Avenue""??"
4,A good read,"Although this could not be described as a 'riveting' book, it presents an interesting picture of life in New York at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. Characterisations are good, although few of the characters are very sympathetic."
4,Book different from movie,"I saw the 1949 movie and bought the book after, so was a little disappointed that the movie and the book had a slightly different ending. Very readable novel, beautiful writing..captures the era very well."
4,Old Faves All in One Volume!,"This is a lovely Christmas collection including popular carols and selections by Dickens, Hans Christian Andersen, L.Frank Baum, Kenneth Graham, Lucretia P. Hale, Clement C. Moore, and Luke, among others. Nowhere have I seen a book with so many of my favorites all together, although, as with most collections there are a few I could live without. While the editor assembled some reputable illustrators of the time (1986,) I would love to see a reprinting with the blander illustrations updated to reflect the multicultural nature of this holiday and our country. Still, on the whole, a good basic compilation of old Christmas standbys."
3,Blood and Fire,"This is classic space opera. The crew of the Star Wold are faced with fighting a war from a ship that seems cursed. Through no fault of their own, they find themselves in deep trouble, and having to fight their way clear. Through courage and ingenuity, they manage. This is a book easy to read. Pure entertainment."
4,A more realistic Star Trek,"A rescue mission for a crippled medical research starship in orbit around a red giant and in the path of a stream of plasma being torn from the red giant by its orbiting blue dwarf, provides the dramatic physical backdrop for this exciting novel. However even more interesting human ethical questions soon dominate the plot. What research was the crippled starship working on that was so dangerous that the starship was placed in such a dramatic ""self-destruct"" orbit, should it ever be needed? What went wrong and can the Star Wolf crew find out while locating and rescuing any survivors in the limited time available?Given the multiple revisions this story has been through (the introduction and afterword explain why), this novel should be an enjoyable read and it doesn't disappoint."
5,Must Read for all UFO fans!!!!,"I was simply astounded by the theories put forth in this book. The origins of Man and the greatest wonders on this planet is explained in a clear and detailed manner. Not a book for the religious however, one must read this book with an open mind.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it has helped me gained a better insight of how vulnerable we are."
5,Additional information about this CD (includes DVD),"I can't ""review"" of this project because I am involved in its creation, but I'd like to offer a clarification: This is not just an ""audio CD"" as indicated here on Amazon.com. There are, in fact, two disks in the package -- a CD with 14 songs PLUS a DVD with two films -- one is an 80-minute documentary about James Reams & The Barnstormers (including lots of concert footage) and the other is a 20-minute preview of a documentary James Reams and Dave Fasano are working on called ""Pioneers of Bluegrass Music"" in which they interview some of the first-generation of bluegrass musicians, including Jimmy Martin, J.D. Crow, Curly Seckler and many more. The full-length ""Pioneers"" documentary is still being filmed and will be released in 2007 or 2008."
5,A book well worth the read,"This is the beginning of a series that I just can't get enough of. And I read a lot. Well worth the time to read it, and the rest of them also."
5,read this,"this is full of magic and wonderful characters. i think the characters were the great thing about this book. the characters were interesting, they were not all perfect, but each were flawed in some way, and overcoming the flaws was the lesson of the story. great book. it's a must read."
4,....well...,I didnt think the book was too bad. It was a little boring at points but it was also gripping and I found myself reading into the night. The sound fx were annoying at first (wheeee eeee especially) but I got used to them and actually enjoyed the book. I recommend it because its a fresh new look to the science of magic. Its a keeper.
2,Issues to consider...,"Boy I hate to be the only bad review! There were several aspects of this book that halted the ""story living in my imagination"" and made me realize I was reading words on a page. One - sounds are not described anywhere in the book. Passages that contain ""whack...ching....thump"" do not tell you what action is taking place, nor what the sounds were attributed to. You are forced to guess what is happening until the next paragraph, where more often than not the action isn't explained. Two - there is a timeflow problem. One minute a character is laying on the ground in an unknown state, and one sentence later is staggering towards the door. When did they get up? How? Slowly, weakly, spasmodically, what? These books will be great reads for some. Myself, I guess I'm just used to a different authorship style."
1,the worst fantasy book i have ever read,"This has to be the worst fantasy book i have ever read. The first 100 pages of the book are so boring! Plus you've got all the stupid sentences that have sounds written out like a door going cree......creek.....cree or other stuff like that, things like that get annoying very fast. This book to me was just very boring nothing happened.The characters are incredibly boring too. I would never recomend this book to anyone its horrible."
1,Stay away from this one.....,"I'd heard some good things about this series so I decided to read the first book. I couldn't have been more disappointed. It was so boring that I barely finished it. Come on now! There's only so much of this femenist stuff I can handle. I can't remember reading a book where women were any more superior and stronger than the men. Yes, women are strong and equal, but to make them so invincible and anti-man is very unbelievable and gave the entire book a sour taste. I like books that portray strong women but not superwomen. Come on now! Also, the magic system got boring after the first couple chapters. The only interesting characters that were slightly realistic were Lerris and his horse. At least they provided some entertainment. I give this book a lonely one star."
1,The magic of Recluce,"GRRRRRRR, Dam....schisch....schisch bang....klirrrr bang...The sounds I recall when I propelled the book with all my might through an innocent window pane. And I made it to page 150. The only interesting facts I gathered were that so many different types of Oak were in existence.Shame on Thor fantasy to sell such junk!!!!!!"
1,repetive,"He must have loved the word boring, it was repeated so many time I was bored... the narrative was anything but exciting. I had to put it down after about four chapters."
3,A bevy of original ideas balked by a halting storyline.,"There was much about this book that I liked: A unique world unlike any other in fantasy fiction; an original approach to magic and its presence. However, at times I found his characterizations one dimensional, some of the same appeared and disappeared with disconcerting precipitance, and the plot line could shift just as abruptly. And, overall, there was a dissatisfying lack of closure and discontinuity to much of the story. I won't say this is the last book I will read of the ""Recluse"" series - the book did have moments of genuine interest - but I will wait until nothing of greater interest is on the reading horizon."
2,Very disruptive writing style,"I found this novel to have a fairly interesting plot line, even if the start was a hair slow. My biggest problem with this work was Modesitt's writing style. I often felt myself taken away from the flow of the story by the author's *very* frequent usage of nonsense letters to represent a sound or an action. Maybe it's a nitpicky complaint, but after reading this work, rather than remembering the depth of the characters, or the pull of the plotline, I came away remembering that I had to decifer what seemed like pages of ""Wheee...eee..."" and ""Thrummmmm.....Thrummmm...."" and ""Splattttt...."" I may check the next book of the series out from the library, but it was definitely too much of a disappointment for me to spend money on it."
4,"Slow start, marvelous finish","First off, let me just say that it took me 3 tries to finish this book all because of the really slow beginning. The first 100 pages or so is a lot of background info on the setting and main characters of the novel. But once you get through this part and understand how the world of Recluce revolves around black and white magic, the action begins and the book turns into a very interesting read. Lots of action and suspense. It kind of reminds me of how you feel when you're playing a really good rpg game. Overall a good adventure for those who are patient with the slow beginning."
5,Facinating...,"The Magic of Recluce is a fascinatingly interesting novel primarily because it does not follow any fantasy cliches. Many people think this tale is boring primarily due to the lack of its cliches, however it is a refreshing and quick paced novel. Lerris is an unforgettable and incredibly entertaining character. His coming of age journey is easy to identify with. This book should be read by any lover of fantasy novels."
3,Everything you've ever wondered about woodworking...,"...but were afraid to ask? While I did enjoy portions of this book, and intend to read the later volumes in the series, several things held the book back. First, Lerris' constant complaints in the first half of the book grate on you--you find the character almost as annoying as the other characters did. Second--too much woodworking. Yes, I realize that the author is trying to make a point about the nature of magic and Lerris' effect on the world, but it could have been trimmed. The book bogs down in the middle before picking up and finishing at a lightning pace in the last hundred pages. Likewise, the first hundred pages are slow to start. It is no coincidence that these two sections have the most woodworking.That said, I enjoyed a fresh ""scientific"" take on magic, and the lack of any stereotypical characters. The villians could have been fleshed out a bit more--their motivations, desires, etc. Still an enjoyable experience, however."
1,"Full of promise, no delivery","Very well written enticement on the back to buy the book. That's about the only well-written thing about it. All clothes appear to be 'faded' in the book, which is one example of a shallow, un-entertaining, and stretched write up on many pages."
1,Boring!,"I couldn't get past the first 70 pages of this book. It was incredibly boring. There are certain words that Modesitt used over and over and over again until I wanted to pull my hair out! Personally, I wouldn't waist my time on a book that offers nothing in the first 70 pages."
4,An killer novel with an (apparently) great magic system.,"I've read this book three times, and liked it every time. It's worth the money and the time it takes to read.This is the first novel (but not the first in the timeline) of a whole line of Recluce books. Don't bother with the rest of them because after this one the author completely hacks up the magic system to the point where it's obvious that anyone who uses it is an irresponsible moron who is literally endangering the safety of the world. This is because magic is divided into light and dark, and any use of either one causes the other to become stronger. Therefore over-using the good (dark/order) side of magic causes a huge buildup of the bad (light/chaos) side of magic, in turn causing wicked backlashes that can disrupt the tectonic strata of the world; followed by a massive long-term decline in the presence of magic (so much that people who depend on it for life extension up and die for its lack). Gee, like using this stuff is smart. Not!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A dour bunch, these Recluce types. If you don't fit in with their particular philosophy, off you get sent, youngster or no.A young man is sent out into the world to make his way, which involves training, wandering around, and meeting a woman.By the end, he realises that those sneaky old folks knew a hell of a lot more about what was going on than he thought. Sneaky manipulative adult do-gooders that they are."
3,"A pleasing, uneven fantasy.","There is much to like about ""The Magic of Recluce"", and much to frustrate the reader. It begins slowly, plodding along through all the details of our hero's early training, but becomes more driven and interesting once it transports him to Candor. If you enjoy thoughtful fantasies that are more character focused rather than run-of-the-mill action/adventure stories, then you will enjoy this one. There are some nice pay-offs at the end, and some interesting twists along the way. Recommended, but not one of the best of the genre."
3,Bizarrely Engrossing,"The Magic of Recluce is a very odd book. By all rights, I shouldn't have liked it. The distracting ellipses, the weird onomatopoeias every other paragraph, and the extremely dry plot (a large portion of the book revolves around building furniture in exquisite--some might say excruciating--detail) are all things that would normally make me drop a novel in an instant. But there's just something about the matter-of-fact, down-to-earth daily life of an artisan that Modesitt manages to make engrossing. While reading page upon page of Lerris making boxes and chairs, I kept thinking ""I should be bored out of my mind"", but I found that I was compelled to read on. The magic elements of the story are almost inconsequential until very late in the story, but the in-depth look at the life of a medieval craftsman is a unique take on the genre that I find myself recommending, if reservedly."
4,Very entertaining overall,"This was the first book I've read by LE Modesitt, I keep coming back to it as being one of the better ones, but like all of his books, you have to put effort into reading them.I love the overall story of Lerris finding his way and finding himself. I love the magical system, especially the ironic black being good, white being evil. But I hate that I have to read and re-read bits because it suddenly gets interesting 1/2 way through the book and I've just glazed over the first part and missed important bits.I think for die-hard fantasy readers, this is an awesome series, if you like lord of the rings and other heavy-ish books, this is the series for you. If you like light, quick reads, pick something else. :)"
1,Dull. Total waste of time.,"I really have no idea to whom this book might appeal. I can only assume that the people who think it is good have never read anything that is actually well-written. If they had, they would realize what a piece of garbage this is. I am 2/3 through it and I am just going to throw it out. I kept waiting for the plot to become clear, for the characters to develop, and for the main thrust of the book to present itself.My favorite character in the book is a horse who doesn't say anything.This book was a waste of my time. If you are widely-read, I would say don't bother. For younger, more inexperienced readers, go right ahead."
2,Ellipses!!!!!!,"Why ... are ... there ... so ... many ... ellipses ... in ... this ... book????The concept could have been good and the magic system is novel, but it is very poorly written and does little to make you like the characters or want to read more about them. Also, the author has an annoying habit of not only using...too...many...ellipses, but also using archaic words and then using them way too much. There are a solid several pages in the beginning of the book where the word 'cubit' was used 5-10 times per page, and then he doesn't use it again for many many pages, even though he gives the measure of several things. It was annoying to use the word so much, and then...what? did he get hit on the head and forget it?Overall, I'm sure that this is for someone but I am not that person."
3,The philosophy is fascinating the writing not so captivating,"I've been reading all of the books in the series, and I'd have to say no matter which book you read first, it will probably be the best one. After the first you will quickly learn that much of the writing is burdened with redundant and trivial detail. The philosophy behind the story is fascinating; the writing, not so captivating. Yet the story continues to evolve with fresh ideas, angles, and principals that you may find worth the read."
3,M.o.R. was a solid read.,"This book had a very promising beginning with a unique idea of a magical world. However, after starting with interesting characters, descriptions, and pacing, the end of the book and the resolution of the plot is too (here's a paradox) quick, yet labored. Also, the author has an annoying habit of sprinkling the background noise as words all through the text."
5,Loved for 2 generations....,I fell in love with this book and continued to read the rest of the saga decades ago. I just introduced it to my 10 year old boy and he just loves it. He cannot put it down and I had to coerce him into putting it down to go to bed. Highly recommended for all fantasy genre lovers...
3,It does the job,"It does the job, but wish it was a little heavier. It occasionally lifts because it's not heavy enough."
4,Quite a useful device,"The drive includes both firewire and usb cables. The power brick may be considered clumsy for some, but I suppose the usb port does not supply enough power to drive the device. The included backup software is excellent (Dantz backup express). There is a 200mb version of the 5000DV (not to be confused with the 250mb 5000XT which is a 5400rpm drive instead of 7200rpm in the 5000DVs) but the price on the 120mb 5000DV seems to be more attractive than the larger drives. If both types of connections are available on your PC, I recommend using the Firewire because I feel (after some research and tests) that it is marginally faster than USB 2 in real world applications. This is a real useful device for backup and multimedia files."
5,"Pricier, but exactly what I was looking for","This is a really nice stand-alone unit that we have in our bedroom. Installation is plug-in, and will leave one outlet open on a standard two-outlet recepticle. As far as I know it works. We have other (different brand) CO detectors throughout the house that are interconnected and hard-wired, and none of them register any CO."
4,A peak at their life,"The series has it's flaws in that it doesn't seem to go in time order so you end up seeing some of the skits twice, but over all it is good comedy with not a lot of glitches in the picture (at least not as many as I was expecting). It isn't as good as their movies but they have a lot of fun especially with their mistakes (which can get repetitive too), but the one neat thing that I found in the episodes is that you get to see what you don't in the movies and get to understand a little more about who they are and how they worked together."
5,Love it,"Great collection, I would definally recomend it to anyone who loves his music and his acting, the prize is great ;)"
3,Martin/Lewis Colgate DVD review,"The quality was good and it was entertaining, their usual style, energy and ""funny factor."""
3,So-so,"Not a bad design, and pretty high-quality, but definately not one size fits all. I have an average-sized head and this was way too tight for my liking. I could hardly get it down to my ears. The price is kinda high too, but most beanies are like that."
1,Not for me,I purchased this for a trek on Kilimanjaro. I found the taste to be repulsive. I was disappointed in the product. I don't believe it delivered on what it claimed it could do.
3,Caribbean Influence,Just bought this CD whilst on holiday in Grand Cayman and am now buying their earlier CD's through Amazon. This is an interesting if undemanding CD. It has a definate caribbean influence to the rather folky bluesy music and is excellent background music. Different from the normal pop music - give it a go!
2,Not Bellow at his best,"If you want to see this writer in full bloom, you will need go to his earlier works. This novel got respectful if unenthusiastic reviews in the press, and I would concur. The novel often seems more about the narrator than Ravelstein, and reads like thinly disguised memoir (and not particularly compelling memoir at that). Not an exciting read but if you are a Bellow fan (and I am), then something is better than none at all."
2,YIN exploits YANG,"Imagine for a moment a world populated by Saul Bellow(Chick) clones with think alike wonderful brains. Now...Take a deep breath... We would all be motionless observers and super refined ""Yin"" type critics of anything and everything that moves, or tries to produce any amount of ""Yang"" energy. Unfortunately, how can we all make a living writing about nervous little barbed TV artists, powerful bald heads destroyed by excessive sex, overzealous, restless, overdevoted wives ...if they're all now inexistant !"
3,"Not a favorite, but worth reading","Ravelstein was not even close to works like Humboldt's Gift, The Adventures of Augie March, and Herzog. It is based on Bellow's friendship with the scholar Allan Bloom, who was famous for his book The Closing of the American Mind. The Bloom figure in the book, Ravelstein, is dying of AIDS.The book is surrounded by sadness, naturally. Ravelstein comes across as a man who either loves or hates, depending on whether one was in his favored inner circle. Clearly Bellow, portrayed here as ""Chick,"" was one of the beloved.I appreciated the character development, but the book seemed a bit unfocused and lacked the charm and insight that are found in his other works. Much of the philosophizing is superficial stuff.Even so, Bellow is a master craftsman and, compared to a lot of the other writers out there, whatever he produced should be read."
4,luminous,"It's unfortunate that the content and true theme of this novel has been subsumed by unseemly literary gossip. This a luminous, beautiful, utterly devastating literary photograph of everything that matters: friendship, love, philosophy, food, sex, marriage, literature, work, basketball, and more. I think Saul Bellow must have loved his friend, very much, to write such a thing.Saul Bellow's ability to plumb the depths through his flawless evocation of the surface is unparalleled. I looked at the faces of those around me in a new light for weeks after finishing this book: to what extent is character revealed by appearance? The plot does 'unravel' at the end, as does our narrator. As we all do, I suspect. I think it's a mistake to assume anything Bellow does is unintentional - including the repetitions and the eventual disintegration of the plot. This is a wonderful, moving, thought-provoking book."
2,Ravelstein or Revelations?,"This an excruciatingly short review:If you rearrange the letters in RAVELSTEIN and add an O, you will have REVELATIONS. Does this encoded word refer to the treatment of Bloom? Or does it reflect the author's feeling that his work is somehow God-given?"
1,Dissapointing Introduction to Bellow (ignore rating),"I had heard Bellow was a fine author; Ravelstein is not my idea of a fine novel. I can't give it a rating because I didn't feel like finishing it - I left at around page 100, at which point it is the author's fault for not keeping me involved. My main dislike is the incessant name-dropping. Can we read a page without hearing about a quick one liner about Plato or Machiavelli? Congratulations narrator/author, you've read these books. I prefer authors who've read them and use them, not that talk about reading them. I never really cared for any of the characters, including the rich professor."
3,what is the big deal?,"This is somehow the first Saul Bellow book that I have read. It would seem that I should read the earlier ones first and then come back to this one. That way I might know how the author's style has developed, which would make the stilted nature of this book more interesting. This is a fictionalized account of a writer's inability to write a memoir about a good friend. The reader has the feeling that Bellow has been asked to describe what ""the color orange"" means and is a bit non-plussed. His inability to commemorate Ravelstein is probably the point and I'm sorry that I didn't find it to be a particularly compelling one. Perhaps I would have understood this book better if I had lost close friends."
3,A Memoir Not A Novel,"If you approach Ravelstein as a memoir rather than as a novel you will not be disappointed by the minimal nature of plot and the rambling nature of the narrative. Allan Bloom apparently was a fascinating individual and as Bellow has done in previous works for other memorable individuals such as Delmore Schwartz in Humboldt's Gift, he creates the work around the larger than life personality of one of his friends while he himself acts as narrator and sidekick. The most valuable effect that reading this book had on me was that it led me to read Bloom's Closing of the American Mind, a monumental work of erudition and opinionated impassioned analysis. For that reason alone, it is worth reading Ravelstein."
2,Disappointment,"A real disappointment. I loved Humboldt's Gift and the subject matter here intrigued me. But it felt like such an undisciplined meander. Frequent repetitions, very many surface descriptions. I never felt like I got to know Ravelstein/Bloom in any real depth. Or maybe his love of expensive things was what he was all about. But without a serious examination of his learning and beliefs (because after all, isn't that what this man was really about) he remains a 2 dimensional popinjay.Disappointed in Bellow's writing. At the end he goes in to that long passage about almost dying but never once relates it to what Ravelstein/Bloom must have been going through as he died. I thought there was such rich ground here for parallels/depth about dying and the human condition. But instead it all read very much like a ""Dear Diary"" rendition of his life. And I thought the book was supposed to be about so much more."
3,look before you leap,"as someone who will read just about anything by saul bellow, and about bellow, i look forward to this new work of fiction. but i can't separate the man from the myth, so last week, i read a memoir by his former agent of several decades, harriet wasserman. her book, oddly shallow but fast-paced, gives us a myopic view of bellow the man, the author, the deeply flawed genius with too many wives to keep track of. she talks about bloom--she helped agent his book due to bellow's insistence. bellow is our great national literary treasure, yet we can not excuse his callousness towards his fellow man and woman. what are we to make of this bloom roman a clef? i dunno. i guess it's our job as readers to enjoy the fictional ride. finally, bellow once commented that he felt that there are about 7,000 readers in the u.s who really understand and appreciate his novels. as a privileged minority we must take our gods as they are, despite their clay feet."
4,There is much better Bellow than this,This is Bellow's most recent and probably last novel. It is the final work of one of the great American literary adventures of this century. It is very far indeed from his greatest works ' Herzog ' and 'Seize the Day'. It at times reads as a kind of exercise built around an idea. It is clearly undisguisedly modeled on Bellow's friendship with Allan Bloom. However much of the ' larger - than-life ' posturing of the Bloom- Ravelstein character give him an unappealing quality that his great best friend perhaps misses. I so much wanted to enjoy this last Bellow as I have some of the others. But this one does not make it for me on that level. I would certainly however recommend it for all Bellow fans. And I would say also that even mediocre Bellow contains many lines and passages of stunning literary brilliance and value.
4,An unexpected present,"Some people did not expected Bellow to produce yet another book at his age. But he gave us this compact, universal and solid book that reflects a brilliant mind providing views on all essential matters of one's existence. To a certain extent a more Continental-European than American discourse, this last present from Bellow is a must to be read now and take notes, and to be read once again in old age and compare notes."
3,"good in parts, but disappointing overall","I've always liked Bellow's books. I did enjoy the first half or so of Ravelstein who appears bigger than life. I think the best scene in the book is right after he buys his Lanvin jacket for $4500 in Paris and immediately spills expresso all over it. Rather than being horrified, he finds it kind of funny, much to the narrator's chagrin. The characterization of Ravelstein is excellent and quite funny in parts, but once they leave Paris and return to the midwest, things drag a bit. The book is not heavy on plot to begin with, but the second half is mostly the recounting of various illnesses. There are too many random academic tirades, too many inserted scenes and too many unconnected events to make this is a great novel. Still, Bellow is very ""on"" in parts and nails his recreation of Harold Bloom on the head. Worth reading, but ultimately, not one of Bellow's very best."
2,A Tedious Work of Ideas,"This is a solid novel of ideas, but is not one of Bellow's best books. In parts, one wonders why one should even care so much about Abe Ravelstein beyond what some would describe as his exacting intellect. Bellow's later work has not aged very well and this is a prime example of why it has not."
4,"First half delicious,second half so-so","Saul Bellow promised Alan Bloom that he would write a memoir of him after his death .Ravelstein is a thinly disguised fictional account of his friend as he was dying of AIDS. Bellow plays Bozwell to the T as he paints a vivid picture of the colorful professor with his love of Cuban cigars, Hermes ties , shirts from Jermyn street & Plato .As long as Bellow sticks to his purported theme he makes for quite an enjoyable read as he recounts the quirks,eccentricities,wit and brilliance of Alan Bloom .However the second half of this novel is no more than morbid navel-gazing on the part of Bellow as he broods over his own mortality and brush with death . I don't particularly like Bellow's prose ,though he does compensate for the stylistic deficiency with his somewhat unique wit and idiosyncratic observation ."
3,A No Man's Land Between Novel and Memoir,"""Ravelstein"" is a noble project in intention more than achievement. Bellow, charged with telling the story of a pretty wonderful person, has decided to exclude any treatment of ""ideas"" from an account of a person who lived for ""ideas."" As an intellectual memoir, the work does not exist. As a novel, the work is without what any propagandized Aristotelian from the University of Chicago would call an imitation of an action. In other words, as a novel, it is without a significant plot. Allan Bloom was a man of genius, wit, and charm. Saul Bellow tells us that on nearly every page, but for whatever reason he fails to recreate this person. Bellow doesn't do for his Socrates what Plato did for his own."
3,Good Subject Poorly Treated.,"I read both The Closing of the American Mind and Allan Bloom's lesser known book, Love and Friendship. I enjoyed both of them and wanted to know more about Bloom, so I got Ravelstein as soon as it came out. I was not as happy with it as I thought I'd be. Without going much into the plot, other reviews have done that, I will say that the book left me wondering about Saul Bellow's reputation as a great writer. There is undoubted insight into Bellow's literary biography of Allan Bloom, but the book itself is either poorly written or poorly edited. Bellow repeats himself word for word several times on different subjects. He also makes several mistakes in references. The ""Nuts"" response to a German surrender demand in WW2 was at Bastogne, not Remagen; and the Rose Bowl, not the Orange Bowl is played in Pasadena. These are little mistakes, but there are enough of them to become annoying."
2,Ravelstein,"While I appreciated the chance to spend time again with the unique voice and viewpoint that Saul Bellow brings to each of his works, I am sorry to say that I found the book to be a disappointment. Surprisingly for a Bellow novel, the portrayal of Ravelstein seemed very one-dimensional, and I felt that the decision to devote the last third of this very short book to the narrator's medical problems rather than to a final orchestration of Ravelstein's life and personality was misguided."
2,Review,"I was very disappointed in this book, the only novel of Bellow which I've read. Some of it, such as the characterization of the life-loving, awkward Ravelstein/Bloom is quite good, but Bellow lets off too easy the male companion, who is nothing more than an expensive prostitute, by describing him as an ""Asian prince"". The waterfall of red orchids is an interesting image, but Bellow keeps needlessly repeating it. Likewise, it's not exactly a profundity to observe with wonder how the human heart beats on ceaselessly etc. - this has been said many times before and with greater elegance. Also, we keep hearing how very beautiful and intelligent the narrator's wife is etc.- enough already. It is readable and workmanlike, but hardly the novel one might expect from a Nobel prize winner."
2,Unnecessary,"A book that covers everything about Bloom, except for what made him interesting: his ideas."
3,Not as much fun as it could be,"Like many of the reviews have said, the puppet is difficult to control. Way back in the day, I had a better version of the puppet as a small kid. The arms were controlled by strings on the outside that you could pull down and they would spring back up when you let go. Best of all, the mouth was wider and had a hole. I spent hours making the puppet eat things just like he did on TV. This is maybe sturdier than my old puppet, but way less fun too."
3,Hard to Manuever,"The puppet is of moderate to high quality and is cute, but is somewhat difficult for a large adult hand to manuever, the opening to move the mouth is very small."
3,Hard to maneuver,"Just as another reviewer said, ""The mouth is hard plastic on the inside and a little stiff to open and close the mouth, so it is almost impossible to work the hands and mouth at the same time."" That is exactly the problem. This toy is cute and my babies love it, but it's uncomfortable to use."
2,"Nice looking, but not functional puppet","We bought this as a Christmas gift for my 10 month old son. The fur is soft and bright and he likes to look at the puppet, but nether I nor my husband can use this puppet as intended. It is very poorly designed and doesn't work for either large or small hands. There is no way to comfortably have fingers move (or even be inside) his mouth and arms at the same time. You have to pick which one you want to move and then switch your fingers around if you want to move the other. Plus, the mouth is so rigid, it is impossible to make him talk for more than 10 seconds without getting a hand cramp. Cute, but useless as a puppet. He is now just a an (un)stuffed animal laying limply around the house; VERY disappointing..."
4,GREAT PUPPET,We bought this for our daughter and she loves when we act like cookie monster. The puppet is small but you can wiggle your hand into it.
1,Mouth Does Not Open Easily & Smaller Than Anticipated.,"I am not very satisfied with this brand of puppets. My daughter has another brand of puppet that we love to play with. The other brand is very easy to use, and we have a ton of fun with it. This brand - the mouth is very difficult to open and not much fun for her because the lack of motion takes away from the animation.I am not very satisfied at all."
3,Well made but stiff,"We bought this as a joke for our 12 year old as we recently watched an episode of Cake Boss with the Sesame Street anniversary being featured. We wanted to surprise him with Cookie coming up behind him with his mouth wide open. Well, good luck with opening Cookie's mouth - you'll end up with severe muscle strain. We monkeyed with Cookie's head, opening the mouth from the outside time and again, to no avail.This is a well made stuffed animal toy but going beyond putting your hand in it to move it back and forth is next to impossible."
5,Puppets,Great item for adults who want to entice young children with a story or for those individuals who are mentally handicap. Durability appears to be great and takes a lot of abuse.
4,A textbook can then really be useful:-),"A useful, inspiring textbook, and with for a computer book good font choices, so that one really likes to open it. It has a lot of typoos which is bothering, but it is good enough to let the author still pass. The reference at the end of the book is particularly useful, because modules and their methods are presented in an order, so that one finds them, when one needs them. I think the book starts entry level and guides quite high up. Still it's not all encompassing: For instance one needs extra material for XML programming and so on. But there are further books, like ""XML Processing with Python"", ""Python Programming on Win32"" or the best Python reference ever: ""Python essential Reference"" published by New Rider, all to get on amazon dot com, of course. When I have to recommend a Python book to a newcommer, and I also want, that he will become good fast, then he'll get this quick Python book. (And I have proof, that it works:-)."
4,Be sure to read the errata!,"I just got this book, so I can't offer a full review yet, but I have one comment, & I'm not really sure if it's good or bad. The book is full of errors, many of which are fairly obvious. That's VERY bad. On the other hand, it's errata sheet (available on the publisher's web site) is quite hefty, so presumably they've gone through & corrected most of them. That's good, but decent pre-publication proofing would have caught most of the errors. If nothing else, this makes me very suspicious of future Manning titles, whose authors might not make the same effort to correct their errors.As far as the content goes, it does seem like an excellent book so far. Very code heavy, with just quick commentary necessary to explain the concepts. The layout is a bit busy for my tastes, but I suspect that I'll get used to that as I read more."
3,Nice idea,"My cat likes the bubbles, but the bubble gun just isn't very practical. It holds a very small amount of bubble juice, and there's nothing to keep it in there so you have to keep it steady and straight or the liquid will drip out. How fun is that? I thought it would be like a water gun, where you put the soap inside the gun, but it's actually a small reservoir on the tip that has a small wand-like circle that lifts when you pull the trigger, which sends air through and makes bubbles.It would be a lot more fun and easy to get the kitty bubbles with a typical wand that you blow on. This was just messy and a pain."
1,Terrible,"This product was useless. Once I filled the chamber, level or not, it leaked. When I hit the trigger nothing happened. The little wand in the gun moved but never blew any bubbles just dripped all over the floor. Tried to use the bubbles without the gun and just used a regular bubble wand and that still didn't work. Terrible product. Waist of money. Would never recommend this to anyone!!!!"
2,let down,"This movie left quite a bit to be desired. The plot had potential, however, for me, it never seemed to get off the ground and get moving. The fight scenes were well done and fast, moving along very well. I enjoyed the fight scenes much more than the rest of the movies, these scenes stood out as well done. Chow Yun Fat stole the show with his easy going mood and quick reactions when attacked. I glimpse of what was to come in his future movie making.Overall, I was disappointed with the movie and feel I must rank it below average."
5,Hopkins 43355 Simply Wiring Kit,"This product was installed on a Toyota Tacoma 2006 in about 20 min. The word, ""SIMPLE"", is the key descriptive word about this product. All you need are a few more ties to follow your original wiring to keep the slack out."
4,Hopkins Plug In,"This kit plugged in with only one slight problem, the wires going to the lights on each side of the truck were slightly too short."
1,oops,i ordered this on accident it wasn't the one for my truck i forgot to look at what year it was for
2,nondescript,"Characters not very believable except for Cody who seems to be a carbon copy of the hero in the movie ""The Client"". Very scanty explanations and far fetched plot. When did Claire have a child and by whom? How come Claire becomes so sensible towards the end and can serve breakfast to strangers who are guarding her. From post traumatic stress symptoms to alert chick. Don't see the merits of this author."
2,Re-inventing the Wheel,"While this book has some excellent information, much of it is a rehash of many other excellent dog raising and training books. The authors keep tossing up a squeaky-tog boogieman -- dog training by harsh methods -- methods that haven't been current in over twenty years. However, I would have rated the book at 3 stars if it weren't for the fact that the authors state that ""there are many pet stores that guarantee the dogs they sell and are extremely responsible in choosing where their dogs come from."" This is on page 65, where they actually imply that a pet store is ""responsible"" if it gets its puppies from a USDA licensed dealer. This is appallingly bad advice. It is NEVER a good idea to buy a dog from a pet store, unless you don't mind supporting puppy mills."
3,Elmo Hand Puppet,"My grandson loved a book that had a little E attached to it. It was too small for my hand and hard to manipulate (y'know,being attached to a book and all).This Elmo is a better size but almost impossible to work hands and mouth at same time. He likes it, but I wish I could animate it more. Maybe I just need longer stronger fingers?"
3,EHH,My son loves when we play with this (he is 1) but the mouth is really stiff and it doesn't open and close well. Other then that its really cute.
3,Difficult to handle,"He looks and feels great but find me a person (an average person, male or female) who can make his arms move without him looking like he has dislocated his wrists! The arms are way too long and don't have stiffeners in the bottom section so it's impossible to have him 'hold' things with his hands or even move his hands really. Plus the mouth is really tough to move too. I was disappointed and expected more from Gund."
3,Nice puppet,"Nice puppet sleeve to short and mouth is very stiff and hard to operate. To difficult for child especially, really does not work to well at all"
3,difficult to move mouth,It is very difficult for an adult to move the mouth on this puppet let alone a child. It is still soft like Elmo should be though.
1,could be better,The mouth is of stiff plastic and it is hard to make the puppets mouth move like a puppet with a cloth mouth does. I am not happy with this.
2,Too small for adult hands,"I have a 1 year old daughter who loves it when I make puppets talk to her. I have really had a hard time finding puppet in the local stores, so I decided to turn to the internet. I used to have some Sesame Street puppets when I was a kid and thought that they were great. So I figured this would be a perfect puppet to use with my daughter.Here's the thing. The opening into the head of this puppet is too small to get a grown ups hand into and still be able to operate the puppet with any ease. This puppet is easier to operate than the Ernie puppet, (which I also bought) but still pretty difficult.The overall look of the puppet is good, but it isn't very user friendly. Needless to say, I am pretty disappointed in this product and wish that I wouldn't have bought it.If you are looking for a puppet to entertain your infant, try checking out Toys R Us. From time to time, I have been able to find some animal puppets that make noise when you use them. My daughter just loves those."
3,Fun but difficult,"I'm not particulary please with how this hand puppet handles. This is due in large part because the stuffing for the head on the inside constricts your hand, and the arms.... forget about using them they're worthless and pointless. However, this is Elmo we're talking about not Oscar the Grouch. Everyone loves Elmo, just like he loves you!!!!"
4,Every childs favorite puppet,This puppet was a great addition to his toy box. It is well made and little kids love it when they see it...FYI don't pull it out of your diaper bag and try playing with it because a little girl may think it's hers and take it from you at a restaurant. The only down side of this puppet is that it's not really made for big handed people like Dads.
3,Cute but difficult to use,"This Elmo puppet is a hit with the kids, but it is really difficult to manipulate with small hands. An adult almost always has to use it to really make it animated."
3,Fun toy but fur falls out,I have the Elmo and Cookie Monster puppets. My son (8 months) loves this toy. He laughs when we use them. Two downsides are it seems impossible to use the mouth and the arms at the same time and the fur falls out! We find blue and red fuzz everywhere. Overall it has been a fun toy for the price.
3,Not such a dream! Lots of common hard to spell words simply not here,"I bought this book based on all the glowing reviews here...and ya know what? You can't believe everything you read. This book is great WHEN it has what you need. But there are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many omissions on common words that one needs a reminder in spelling. Case in point: the word ""erythromycin"", a common enough generic name for an antibiotic, was not listed here. How ridiculous. Frustrating.I am coping with the omissions here by writing directly on the pages words that should be included but aren't, as I encounter them in my studies. Of course nothing is perfect. But this book needs some major, rudimentary updating."
3,Disappointed,Balls grips are worn. Do not buy If you plan to use it to play polo because it's not going to have enough grip for regular play.
3,mediocre condition,"the ball was a bit scuffed up and the box was ripped when received. Ordered ball new and was not sure why it looked a bit used or worn. ball still satisfied purposes ( can you really break something like that?). besides that fast delivery, I guess."
5,Greatest Ball Ever,Mikasa is still the best game ever. Grip is great and the colors make such an attractive ball to the game.
4,"Honest, confusing realism","The characters in this novel are both fascinatingly ""other"" while at the same time easy to indentify with. The book captures how it feels to be young and in love, to be young and misunderstood, to be experienced and bitter, to feel torn between two selves. The novel shows us both hard and loveable sides of each of three main characters--constantly challenging our desire to judge and fix each character's nature in one place. The book ends ambiguously as if we really had encountered these people in life and then suddenly lost touch. The two seductions of a 16-year-old boy--first by a 30-year-old woman and secondly by a 15-year-old girl--are presented without any vulgarity but in a way that makes clear the sordid nature of the sex which is close to rape. The connection between sex, desire, power, and competition is richly treated."
3,"Not my favorite Colette, but an interesting novel","Set in summer in Brittanny, Vinca and Phillipe are childhood friends who are awakening to sexuality.Phillipe has an affair with an older woman, a theme taken from Colette's own life. The affair has a lasting effect on the teenage lovers. This book is provocative, as only Colette could be on the subject of sex."
1,Gives gays a bad name,"The first one had a camp value and there seemed to be some kind of redeemable quality about it, this was just trash from the word go. A thin premise that allowed them to show a lot of bare skin and enough simulated sex to almost qualify it as porn. Every stereotype and preconception of the gay lifestyle that's used by the right wing to attack us is thrown up onto the screen and sets us back another twenty years. Celebrity guest stars? I don't consider porn stars celebrities, and the few real celebrities there were, barely qualify. I was sad to see RuPaul lend her talents to this trainwreck. I don't know how they pay to make these things, but it's a sad world where this crap gets made and more deserving scripts are sitting somewhere collecting dust. I'll know NOT to even bother should the sevent seal be broken and they make a third installment."
1,You'll want a time machine to un-see this movie,"Perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not much else to say. Terrible plot, terrible jokes (to the point that they even ruin the raunchy humor and render it un-funny). And to add a fat annoying turd on top of an incredibally nasty sundae would be Perez Hilton is littered throughout the movie. What more is there to say? DON'T SEE IT!!! It's not even one of those really bad movies that people talk about where you want to see just how bad it is (the kind of bad that it's almost funny). This is just bad."
2,too much,"Well, for USA standards (afraid to see a boob on TV) this ""unrated"" doesnt't make any sense.For European standards a too over exagerated too campy film."
1,Quality Sucked,This movie would have been great if the quality didnt suck. It was pausing every two second so I couldn't even understand what they were talking about. Bullshit.
1,Beyond Bad and that's not good,"It's no wonder almost none of the original cast reappeared for this sequel. To say that this movie was bad, would be an understatement. The writing was bad, the chemistry between the actors was bad, the film was bad. I understand how they thought this may be funny doing a parody of every sorry scene from all kinds of films but it just didn't work. It came off cheap, gross and worst of all, boring!! So do not waste your time or money. Skip this one because it contains none of the fun of the first film ""Another Gay Movie""."
1,Terrible movie,"As funny as the first movie was, this one was just awful. About 15 minutes in, I realized just how bad it was going to be and it never got better. The sad part is I was so excited for this movie to come out!The dialogue is awful. The eye candy is there, but it's just too silly. Another review says ""it is what it is"" and I completely agree. Thumbs way down."
1,A total waste of TIME & Money!!!!!,"Save yourself the grief, rent it, if you absolutely must, but dont buy it. NOTHING at all like the first one. Bad sets, bad acting and almost a whole new cast. It lost the charm & the humor, and they substituted it with a very ill looking RuPaul in he/she drag, and the obnoxious, overated, hard to look at Perez Hilton. The only good thing about this movie is the return of Jonah Bleckman, who cant even save the movie, because it is just not funny! Just skip over this one, your not missing anything at all."
1,WE asked for it and did we get it!,"""Hollywood"", wherever that may be today, which is anywhere..amazes even me, a movie freak. Producers giving money to a film that's NOT funny, not even CLOSE!...the ONLY thing good about THIS movie and it lasts about 1-2 minutes..is the scene when Brent Corrigan(porn actor with an ass of GOLD!)..plays the merman and comes out of the water, he was great ...otherwise this is one of the worse movies I've ever seen.I loved the first one and they didn't have to do the same exact script...but there was NO script, it was all about slapstick which was horribly done..do not buy it..go to the LIBRARY,if they have it, and borrow it for FREE..don't waste another penny on this bomb...[...]OK ENUF!!Tony(nyc)"
2,not as good as the first,"Loved the first movie and really wanted to like the sequel. a couple laughs does not make a comedy. the throw up scene was a rip off of the ""team america"" puppet movie. been there seen that.having poop on the guys lips was not funny. it was just plain bad humor. it fell flat.the movie just had a lot of down time between the FEW funny moments.come on guys...we have the talent out there.you can do better."
3,Funny movie,I liked this movie. Of course it wasn't as good as the first one and it would have been nice if they had kept all of the original cast members from the first one but it was good. Perez Hilton's cameo was pretty funny.
3,Another Fort Lauderdale Story,Boys ofAnother Gay Moviecame to Fort Lauderdale to relax and enjoy their young bodies as family affairs hunted them inSpring Break-style vice versa!It is truly a stupid funny comedy to laugh at.
3,A Little Dissapointing...........,"for those of you expecting an amazingly funny rehash of the original, GO AWAY NOW! ""Sequel"" picks up sort of where the last one left off, WITH A COMPLETLY DIFFERENT CAST OF MISSFITS ( OK, ONE GUY IS THE SAME), and they are terrible compared to the orriginal actors. Guest apperences by Rupal, Laby Bunny, and Michael Lucus (yum), make the movie better. all in all its worth getting ur hands on, just dont expect gay comedy perfection."
2,A really bad sequel,"""Another Gay Movie"" was campy and fun. The sequel was a complete waste of time. Only one of the actors from the first movie made it into the sequel; the rest were recast with inferior actors. The campiness and color were both there, but the fun was missing. Watch if you really want to, but be forewarned that this doesn't hold a candle to the first."
4,"Ok, it's not Oscar material.....","But it's alot of fun. Silly, ridiculous, even touching at times. This movie doesn't take itself seriously, or anything else, for that matter. It makes the most of being outrageous and wild, and it succeeds very nicely in that. It isn't trying to be a politically correct straight movie; in fact, it is just the opposite, and that is its charm.I know, I know, I should be offended by this movie and its portrayal of gay stereotypes, but I'm just not. We gay people are widely varied, so why not celebrate how special we are, from screaming queens to butch bears, etc. I for one am proud to be part of such a great community!!"
1,worst movie ever,"This movie is one of worst movies ever made. When only one main actor returns for a sequel you know it has to be bad. Plus, Rupaul must have been very desperate for money to lower herself to be in such a stinker. Even the eye candy isn't worth the pain caused by watching this movie. Don't waist a penny on this trash."
1,very disappointing!,"Gosh. I saw the first one, which had cute actors and a very good and funny plot, however, this sequel... what was that? money maker? Completely trash. It seemed a parody (very bad one) on the first movie. The story (was there one?) was bad. The actors, only the one who has the gay father is gorgeous. What a body! I did regret having bought it. Even having seen it. But, if you enjoy trash parodies..."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this movie. It was not as good as the first movie. The comedy was very stupid and I think this really makes gay people look bad.
2,Another Gay Sequel,"With gay men steeped in depression, these nellie hystrionics are worth it for the escapist value. Watch it & chuckle with a friend."
1,Skip this sequal and buy the 1st movie.,"ok, this isn't really a sequal, just more of the same jokes from the 1st movie, ""Another gay movie."" This sequal is not funny, suffers from really bad editing and plot lines and is a near-total waste of time. The scary part is that there is going to be another sequal called, ""Gays is Space."""
2,Not quality product,"I ordered one of these from this M.V company and two from The Wok Shop...the ones from the Wok Shop are way better looking, and better quality. i wont order from this company, unless i get my money back....Bless"
1,Disappointing Ex-small Clay Pot,"I ordered an Extra Small Chinese clay pot (1 qt). What I received was a (1 qt) clay tea pot. If you are going to sell these items, please Make surethat all items come from the same vendor. I would liked to have known that I was purchasing a TEA POT and not a cooking pot."
4,Works Well,"I have used it for almost a week and it works as advertised. My only complaint is that the battery contacts are wire, which seems cheap. However, it does charge the NB-1LH batteries for my camera, which is what my primary concern was. One other note, it takes well over an hour to charge these batteries."
1,It doesn't work,"This battery charger does not charge the battery. Battery slides in and green light stays on implying that the battery is charged, which it's not. Pressing on the battery to improve contact causes the orange light to come on implying that the battery is being charged, but orange light turns green when I stop pressing. So, I put rubber bands around the battery and charger to hold the pressure and the orange light stayed on for a little while, but then turned green and battery did not charge after eight hours. It's a piece of junk!!"
1,Bad Quality,This unit is the same size as the original canon and comes with a car adapter. I plugged it in and put a battery and it started charging and the LED changed to orange. Next I tried another battery and the green light stayed on. I touched the battery and the LED turned orange and started charging. Touched again and it went back to green. With this I cannot rely on it that it would charge my batteries. I might think that the batteries are charged and they wont be. This is totally useless thing. I am returning and buying another brand.
1,It's not that easy...,"I bought this to help me plan a simple model railroad plan for the basement. The amount of work that it takes just to figure out all of the nodes of this software makes it impractical at best, and a waste of money at worst. In the time that it takes to build this digitally, you could do better to do the planning manually and actually learn more.It is not a game. It is supposed to be a model railroad build software tool of which it is a poor one."
4,Principles Of Patent Law (Hornbook Series),"More in depth than David Pressman's ""Patent It Yourself"". It's written for law students, and may be too detailed for some, and lack info for others."
1,This is not a good textbook.,This book could benefit from a rigorous peer review. Complex theory is over-simplified and misleading inferences are made on seemingly every other page. The typographical errors were fustrating.
1,Absolutely poor textbook,"This book lacks any new science. The author's ""tangents"" into other aspects of geology are often inacurate and misleading to students of any level. The author's claims of science and discovery are eccentric and very odd to read. This book needed a more detailed peer review process."
1,Absolutely poor text.,This book should have never made it through a peer review process. It is hard to believe that the author was allowed to display so much opinion and mis-information. Refrences to geology in this text are inacurate and pose a matter of debate of the author's credibility.
4,Good Quality,The liner was very nice but much thicker than I expected.Very rubbery so it grips well.
2,Disappointed - too corny,"It's definitely thinking sideways, but really reaching for that answer. Just too corny, even for gradeschoolers. Like the first one - woman had a goldfish that was unwell. brought it to vet and miraculaously healthy again. he replaced it with a new one! See, reaching for it too much. Check out Stories with Holes, Nathan Levy. very interesting, a few are too corny but most are great. With a few word changes are great even for 2nd graders."
2,Does not work with GBA Micro,"This does not work with the GBA Micro. It works well going from a GBA SP -> an SP or a DS. There really isn't a reason to have a cable between two DS systems as they have wireless. Really, its a SP->SP cable with an SP/DS adapter on one end.For what the cable really is, it works well. Sadly, it isn't really what is listed. The item I purchased was from a 'used' vendor, so your mileage will definitely vary depending on who/when you purchase."
2,Disapointed,"I have the Golden Dawn Manual, so to speak . It's a great book. This book "" Ritual Magic of the Golden Dawn"" was not well written or edited.However, I was able to retrieve a few nuggets of knowledge sporadically."
2,Only a nice cover...,"I expected this book to be much better than it really is. Its a collection of lectures on various esoteric subjects but they are definetely not well written. I expected to find rituals and practical magick, as the title implied ""Ritual Magic of the Golden Dawn"", but all I found were various chaotic teachings and magickal tips. The part on astral projection as those on clairvoyance, are confusing and dont include any systematical information. It became very difficult to read this book and I often wondered if the authors had any spiritual experiences or not... Much of the information presented in the book is a part of the indian tantric tradition, but its presented here in a very limited way, often having changed the original occult terms. What is the Golden Dawn? Which are its organized esoteric teachings? This book failed to answer these questions."
5,Cool T-Shirt at Reasonable Price,"The T-Shirt is made by 'Rapid Dominance' company, who created it with high quality material. As advertised, it is made with 100% cotton. It is not like other cheap quality T-shirts which you can almost see through. The logos are made with fabric, so you must take good care while washing it. The thick cloth is of real good quality. There is nothing to complain about it. It's a very nice T-shirt to wear."
3,Could be a great account.,"As an avid ex-sailor and amateur historian the Bowdoin has been well known . What is lacking in the book are several ommissions that should be added in the next edition .Ex. An index would be useful in chasing down facets of information that one might wish to pursue . E.g. ""Etah"" is mentioned . As I know it is a base in Greenland it is not easy to extract data on this area. {One wonders if the word is a slap at humor-{Backwards it spells ""Hate""} Also missing are maps of each major voyage and the time frame that it covered , If the author would get in touch with me I have an historical card and picture of the Bowdoin mailed in 1925 from Canada showing the bowdoin at the three radio operators that manned the Zenith short wave radio as well as the Bowdoin . . The card relates that it was at Etah which is 78 degrees north latitude"
5,Nice portrait of traditional boat & its people,"An engaging and readable account of a famous and much-loved traditional sailing vessel, much of it through the accounts of the people directly involved in sailing the Bowdoin, or restoring her later in her long life. The author is particularly good at presenting the people involved and letting their interests and quirks show through, without becoming intrusive (reminiscent of John McPhee). The writing exceeds the usual standard for enthusiast books about boats."
5,there last Great Album,"I dig Earth,Wind&Fire but it's been years since they blew me away.this was there last great Album in a Run from 74-79 where they were on point on the Music&overall Production.Props to the Genius of Maurice White.""Diana"" is cool cut.""Can't let go"",Let your feelin's Show"" are still slammin&the Horns are even better sounding now with the Re-mastering.still I know there has to be more vault material that hasn't been un-earthed especially during the Charles Stephney Era where he co-Produced with Maurice White.A Toast to the Elements."
5,Their Best Album Now In Good Sound Quality and Packaging!,"Great as Earth, Wind and Fire is, they have never really been known as anything other than a singles band but if you are looking for their best non-compilation album, this one has to be it. Even the filler tracks here are good and with ""In the Stone"", they have what is probably one of the best ever tracks to have ever opened any album. Other all-time great EW&F tracks are here such as ""After the Love is Gone"", ""Boogie Wonderland"" and ""Star"". In this version, we also get a very well designed and executed mini-lp replica sleeve which very faithfully resembles the original album cover as well as an insert with all the lyrics in English and Japanese. The biggest plus of this version is the remastered sound quality which is very good. For all fans of EW&F and of great soul/acid jazz/r&b music, this version of this album comes highly recommended."
5,EWF at it's greatest,"This is one of my favorite CD's of all time. It has some of the finest that EWF ever recorded including the all-time smash, After the Love is Gone. If you want to hear them at their best this is the CD to add to your collection"
5,the last must have Album from the Elements,"this album that came out back in 1979 was the last Great Whole Album from the Elements. ""In the Stone"",Can't let Go, Wait were all my jams. but the classic Slow Jam""After the Love is Gone"" is the cut that is best remembered from this Album. Boogie Wonderland with the Emotions was the Elements way of acknowledging Disco. the Horns and in the Pocket Rhythms Associated with Earth,Wind&Fire are all felt here. Phillip Bailey showcases his Falsetto on ""Star"". the arrangements&Grooves are all on point from start to finish here."
5,The BEST!!!!,"Although they're not the great I AM, this album is a tour de force from one of the most under-rated groups to come on the public scene. I happen to believe they were a phenomenal group who were never really given the credit they deserved, and after you hear their style and arrangements which are on this recording, you'll have to agree.Songs like ""Boogie Wonderland,"" ""In the Stone,"" ""After the Love is Gone,"" ""Star,"" ""You and I,"" and others are simply delicious to listen to, and you'll find yourself going back for more, and possibly seeking out their other recordings.Listen and love it. Highly recommended!!!"
4,Boogie Wonderland with The Emotions,"I don't like ""Boogie Wonderland,"" but I did enjoy the not eminent songs from I Am such as the groovey ""Can't Let Go,"" the shine of ""Let Your Feelings Show"" with its guitar work and nice vocals, and the instrumental ""Rock That!"" ""After the Love is Gone"" was a hit. ""Wait"" is a slow jam that you must check out. ""Diana,"" which was previously unreleased, is another hidden gem."
3,Nott the best thing I've ever watched.,"I really love the Pixies music and have watched as much live footage of the band as I could. I was pretty disappointed with the quality in this film. With an entire tour to take footage from,the majority came from just a few dates played. If this was the best footage they had to choose from their camera and sound people must have been very poor at their jobs indeed. This was a missed opportunity to get a high quality concert film of the Pixies. Buy it if you are a big Pixies fan and can get it cheap,but don't pay retail."
2,BAD BAD BAD,Either I bought a bad copy or the sound on this is terrible. The camera work is excellent so it is a shame that it sounds so bad. I was really looking forward to this release and it sounds so bad that I turned it off halfway through.dmh
1,very week,i had av724-20 for about a WEEK IT FELLOVER THE HANDLE BROKE MILWAUKEE WOULD NOT REPLACE IT. EVEN THOUGH THEY ADMITTED THE HANDLE TO BE WEEK....
2,Milwaukee 28v Hammer Drill,"I purchased the ""bare tool"" because I have some v28 batteries, I like them because they stay charged on the shelf (within reason). This drill broke in Consumer Reports testing of hammer drills. Also, it is made in China. Performed very well in drilling concrete block for anchors. The side handle is the best yet of Bosch, DeWalt, Makita that I own. It is easily adjustable and stays put. UPDATE: 11/09 Recently had a conversation with a sales person at H.D. orange store. He said that they (H.D) are no longer pushing the 28v Millwaukee stuff due to the many failures in this line of tools. Basically because Millwaukee is using 28 volts on 18 volts guts."
1,No battery,"The drill itself feels terrific. Heavy construction, tight tolerances, everything you could want. But what the Amazon page doesn't tell you is that it doesn't include a battery. Suddenly that great savings is not so great. Fully outfitted this will cost you closer to $400."
4,Keeps getting better!,"Not only does the artist, Don Johnson, keep getting better, but this CD keeps getting better the more I listen to it! It's easy to hit ""repeat"" when the variety of musical styles and the depth of the lyrics delivers something fresh & new with each play.The production and the band's performance is fantastic! The producer seems to have struck just the right balance of showing off the obvious talent in the band, making the music interesting in and of itself, and supporting/enhancing the lyrics.Finally, I really admire the courage in the songwriting. Clearly, Don is sharing with his audience some of his own personal path, and when I listen to his music, I feel like he allows me to join him on that for a little while..."
4,Song Review,"I don't who this don johnson guy is, but I like what he is doing...poetic lyrics, powerful imagery and great songwriting.I heard a few tunes on his website...""Goodbye"" a slow blues tune, with haunting lyrics, moaning harmonicas, banjo back in the mix..sounds like the Doors on the someone's back porch.The other song on the website, is an uptempo ska tune..that just rocks...great rhythm section, great vocals and guitar work...I listen to alot of music and something tells me this guy can write good songs. Nice to hear some new singer songwriter music that isn't just acoustic guitars...this guy has a full band with him and they seem to perform different styles..."
5,Taking website projects to the next level,"Loosely Coupled: The Missing Pieces Of Web Services by Doug Kaye (CEO of RDS Strategies, LLC) is a 352-page instructional guide for advanced website developers and programmers to learning more about topics such as transactions, security, reliable asynchronous messaging, and more. While Loosely Coupled does not cover the basics of web services, such as creating source code or XML fragments; it is a first-rate resource for extending the capabilities of a website designer to taking their website projects to the next level."
5,He's got it right!,"As a number of reviewers have indicated, this is not a recipe book for implementing Web Services/SOAs. Rather, Kaye provides a terrific overview of the proper way to approach Web Services/SOAs. He correctly eschews the use of object-to-object invocations through Web Services and instead evangelizes a true *service* model where services with well-defined interfaces are accessed - not object methods invoked.Once he's made that important point, he identifies shortcomings or ""missing pieces"" in the current offerings (e.g. security, workflow) and offers insightful solutions or potential solutions.A ""must-read"" for technology leaders and business leaders interested in SOAs implemented through Web Services."
2,Lovely to look at; horrible to follow...,"I've been exercising and dancing religiously for years and years, and am familiar with most dance moves. However, this workout requires you to be able to incorporate multiple, relatively complex combinations in a very short time. People who buy a workout tape are using it to get exercise, not learn how to dazzle their friends, so it shouldn't be so hard, you can't do it. I've tried this at least 4 times with the same response; after the first 10 minutes, I get frustrated and switch it with another one. Significant turning is a really bad idea when you're learning a routine, because then you can't see the TV, and he's got these turns right in the beginning. Forget it."
3,"good book, but not for self-teaching","I learned first-year German with Kontakte and was generally pleased with it. There is a good amount of cultural context, and the design is lively enough to maintain visual interest.Do not buy Kontakte a self-teaching text or if you want a structural approach to language acquisition. For Kontakte to work at all, you absolutely must have a German speaker to lead you through speaking and conversation."
1,I made mistake buying this one .....,"For this amount of money I expected much better book. Unfortunately I think that this is one of the worst books of this type. You can buy much better book for just a fraction of the price. The subjects are confusing and as they say ""information-gap activities"" are definitely not fun. You better know some German if you are planning to use this one. It is made of a quality material so I give it one star. This opinion is for the Fifth Edition."
1,review of workbook received,I am disatisfied with this item and have requested to return it. It was totally outdated for the class that I am taking. I had ordered a copy of the text and was sent a WORKBOOK instead. It did not match the text being used. I have the return label. What else do I need?Judith Brandenburg
2,Smells weird and doesn't clean very well,"We're a Molton Brown household but this is a bad product. It smells weird enough that when I first used it, I went searching to find out what smelled bad in the bathroom to find out it was my hair!!"
2,Misleading & Incorrect Image,"When you do a search on Amazon for ""David and the Giant Little Golden Book,"" this book is the first thing that pops up. The image looks just like a Little Golden book, but this book is not even by the same publisher. The image is incorrect since the actual book does not have the golden binder that is displayed in the image. The book is actually a very small board book. Although the item is misrepresented, it is a good book if you have a toddler to enjoy it."
2,Buy new!,"This product arrived at my door pretty beat up. Since we bought it used, I didnt feel comfortable sending it back for some cosmetic damage. It was still readable, but some of the flaps were missing, and the cover was pretty beat-up."
4,Young children enjoy this book,"While this book did not thrill me, my daughter loves it! She has chosen this book over many others time and again to have read to her. It has been over a year since she first saw it, and she still loves it. I run a childcare in my home and the children enjoy it too. The pull up parts on the pages engages children to participate in the story. Even though an adult may not like a story or the illustrations, children are the ultimate judge. The copy I have is a chunky board book which fits well in small hands."
3,Unusual World Coins too often Unusefull,"I knew the second edition and hoped this 4th edition would be much more than that first attempts to cover this endless territory of unofficial coins. The reality I found disappointing. There seems no clear line in choices which ""coins"" are in the book and which were not included. 80 year old issues that should be in this catalogue are missing; recent purely commercial issues that could be ignored are included.Prices of the more modern issues are often only the issue price. That doesn't help to find a real market price.All together I would say in some cases this book can be really helpful, but often you will find nothing about the coin/medal you're looking for."
3,A first approach for ECU listings,The book has many pictures and the coin price evaluations seem to be up-to-date. I bought this book because of its ECU coin listings.Some countries are well covered like the Netherlands and Spain but on other countries most Ecu coins are missing.What is really bad is that there are no Pre-Euro coins in this book. Therefore i give only 3 stars.
3,Sibelius: Symphony No. 5,Bought this book for a class. If you are into 20th Century Analysis or Sibelius or like 20th Century Music then this book is for you. Otherwise you will not enjoy reading this. The book clearly states the emotions of Hepokoski's take on Sibelius's composition as well as a breakdown in the score.
4,The First Humans,"I thought that this book was an excellent resource for people researching the roots of humankind. The only problem with it that I had was that it tended to give different facts in different parts of the book. For example, in one part it said that it was proven that Neanderthals buried their dead with ibex horns, or cave bear skulls and therefore had a religion and believed in an afterlife, but in other parts it stated that the ibex horns were just thrown in the general area of the burial and that the cave bear skulls were the result of several generations of cave bears living in the cave and dying out before the Neanderthals moved in. I thought it was a good read, but in some places controversial and confusing. If you're into prehistory and evolution, I wouldn't be without this volume. I would actually give it 4 1/2 stars."
5,2 COPIES ARE NOT ENOUGH!!!,"I have 2 copies of this wonderful performance.Both have different editing and camera angles.If your an INXS fan then you will love this, Michael Hutchence's stage presence is mesmerising and few others can compete.The band has a quality that few appreciate and this live performance really showcases their musical talents.It's a shame that this won't be brought out on DVD as it's too easy to wear out the VHS!"
5,INXS Live,"I forgot just how awesome this group from Australia was. This DVD is over the top hot. The energy of the crowd at Wembley Stadium is so high, well it just made the whole viewing experience surreal,like one was there at the taping."
5,A Riveting Concert DVD!,"I am so glad that this wonderful concert was taped and preserved for all INXS fans to enjoy over and over again!I have watched it several times, and find the performances to be absolutely riveting.Every song sounds fantastic, as the band performs before an adoring British audience at Wembley Stadium. The only song missing is ""Don't Change"", and I can forgive them that, since the others are outstanding.If you are a fan of INXS, you will love this DVD!"
4,"Classic band, classic DVD","The consummate live band, these guys could put on a show, and the DVD proves it."
5,This is the Pinnacle! If you headline Wimbley!,"What can you say there is nothing better for a rock group to attain than to play for 100,000 people and have the place singing all your songs! You don't reach any higher highs than this as a band! Awards are B.S. playing live is what it is all about! INXS played before 100,000 people crowds many times around the world as well as festivals. YOU MUST HAVE THIS VIDEO IF YOU ARE A FAN. It is your duty to Michael and the gang to buy it and damn those corporate folks who have not dubbed this to DVD yet,, I am sorry to say not available on DVD! Michael lives for every! don't forget it,, BTW music stinks today!"
2,calendula spray,I used it on a burn on my leg and it made the area sting and hurt worse. Maybe on a more minor burn it would work better.
2,Introduction to Bokken & kobudo review,"This dvd says ""introduction"" to Bokken & Kobudo, but sadly it is not for the beginner. The sword movements are to over complicated and none of the basic footwork or wrist movements etc is properly explained. Not for the beginner, would suit someone with years of iaido practice behind them though."
4,Family Favorite,"Mrs. Piggle Wiggle was 'The Nanny'/'Dr.Phil' of her time. These stories offer parents and children interesting ways to deal with daily chores and struggles that can sometimes seem overwhelming. I enjoyed reading this book as a child and couldn't resist purchasing it for my girls 4 and 2 to enjoy. We have been working our way through various childrens' novels as part of our bedtime ritual. Books like this are good for holding the attention of children at various levels of reading and reading comprehension. These stories have also served as a springboard for discussion in our family about finding creative new ways to accomplish the many tasks that need to be done to keep the household running. Some of the material may seem dated, but it's definetely a classic."
3,Very very silly!,Mrs. Piggle Wiggle is a book that I think 8 year olds would enjoy the most. I did love the fact that her house was upsidedown. I think it should have been given an award.
3,Newer cover artwork,"If you are at all reminicent of the old artwork from this book you will unfortuately be dissapointed. The book I received came with the new artwork, unlike the image shown on the book's page (although for some reason the main display image is of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Farm, not this book).It is also different to read this book now as an adult. I now recognize plenty of gender stereotypes and countless things that would not be considered PC. I wish they'd re-write it to be more empowering and less offensive. As of now I would not feel comfortable reading this to my children."
5,Still enjoyable,I remember Mrs Piggle-Wiggle when I was a kid. I was pleased when my daughter asked me to buy this for her. Mrs Piggle-Wiggle is still as much fun as I remember. My daughter enjoys the stories and thinks Mrs Piggle-Wiggle's cures are funny.
2,"Inappropriate, Not Updated for Modern Times","This was one of my favorite books from childhood, however, my memory did not serve me well. I bought this book for my 7YO son and was dismayed at the improper phrases to describe the mothers, fathers and children in the book (e.g., wife crying to get her way with her husband, describing a child as ""fat girl""). The contents of this book should be modernized and re-edited. There also are several $3-words used, which are not appropriate for a young audience. Simple is best. Impudent? Really? Why not just use the word ""rude?""In addition to those flaws, I did not enjoy reading the stories again as an adult. They didn't live up the magical, humorous memories that I had. Instead, the ""cures"" are quite boring and uninventive. Why I thought they were so clever as a girl... I do not know!"
1,Not for my family..,"While I'm sure I'll get rude comments for not liking the book, it wasn't for my family.I purchased the audio off of ****** and sat down with my 2 girls, 4 and 6 to listen to a new book. Within 5 minutes, I turned it off and dumped it.I didn't like that Mr. Piggle Wiggle died after he buried his treasure. I didn't like the little girl that visits Mrs. Piggle Wiggle doesn't think her mother is her real mother. She wants to know why a real mother would want her to do the dishes. She also wants to run away, because she hates doing the dishes.Didn't make it past anything else. I'd heard enough after my 4 year old sat on the floor and told me she was running away..."
2,Values of our Childhood Now Outdated,"Reading these Mrs. Piggle Wiggle stories to my own kids was a kind of Proustian experience. Not having thought of them for 35 years, I remembered every word, every name (""Yes Hearthrug dear...)"" only now perhaps I understand Betty McDonald's wonderfully ironic sense of humor. ...In the 50s, perhaps these books worked on levels available to both children and their parents; today, unfortunately, they only stand as a kind of sad reminder to parents who have actually GROWN OUT of the ""normal"" violence of a thankfully past age. Publishers reprint famous books that sold well in the past; here, they're banking on our memory of the titles to keep these books profitable for them. They don't care, obviously, about their message. Reading them as adults, however, we should realize it's time to retire Betty McDonald's assumed value system. ""Ramona"" is flat-out annoying, but at least she teaches kids better expectations for relationships between men and women."
3,The Original Love and Logic,"I believe it was my third grade teacher that began reading these to me, and instantly I was hooked. Betty MacDonald is an authoress who can write to both adults and children with fine hilarity, and her character Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle makes Mary Poppins look like a moron. I find her the progeny to the Love and Logic system. The book is filled with multiple stories about kids with various, common behavior problems. Concerned parents call up Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle who then doles out a hilarious but effective cure. It's fairly scripted, but the stories are cute and funny just the same."
5,I remember these books as a child...,"I remember reading these books as a child, and I will read these stories to mine. Although a little dated, they are still as delightfully funny as I remember.The normal things that kids don't want to do are given a new light, and a new way to get them to do it. No matter what the problem is, Mrs. Pigglewiggle always seems to have the cure. And as silly, or strange her cure may seem, it always works!My favorite story was always ""The Selfishness Cure."" About a kid who was being selfish, and would share nothing! So Mrs. Pigglewiggle advised his mother to label EVERYTHING he owned. It was an adorable story!I highly recommend these books. It would be fun for the whole family to get together one night each week, and read one story in this book. That's what I plan to do with my daighter (when she gets a little older, that is.)"
5,You Can't Beat Mrs. Piggle Wiggle,"If you want good ol' fashioned stories that have upstanding morals, self discipline, and wisdom at their core, then these are the books for you. My grade school teachers read these to us and now I read them to my kids. These are truly timeless stories that should never go out of style. They are great for bedtime as most of them or pretty short."
4,mrs.piggle wiggle,I think this book is a very good book . Its anout an old lady shes a widow .She moves to this town and all the childern start to like her the childern star to act up so she has a cure for everything . I think shes wierd really shes an alright lady
5,Great Books - Box Set,"This is a set of four books: Mrs Piggle Wiggle, Mrs Piggle Wiggle's Farm, Mrs Piggle Wiggle's Magic, and Hello, Mrs Piggle Wiggle. Good way to get the set."
3,"Okay tent, not as nice as my old Coleman cabin","Tent sets up okay. Could use more stakes in the front and back to keep it taught. I didn't silicon it on my first use and that was regretable. I ended up with quite a large puddle inside the tent after a heavy rain storm. Make sure you take the time to water proof it. The head room wasn't bad, but not as good as my old Coleman cabin. You need to be in the center of the tent if your tall (I'm 6'3""). The shoe pocket is a nice idea, but it would be better placed on the other side of the door, closest to the zipper. There doesn't seem to be much available in the way of cabin tents in this size range, which is how I ended up getting this one. Once it's properly water proofed, I'm sure it will meet my needs."
2,Not so complete,Overall I found the book much too general and the advice about late night meditaion [to solve problems] bogus.there are some good things in the book but the ' complete' in title I dont accept.If you have read other natural health books this one might be good for you.Its selling for 5$ used here!
5,8-year experience,"I really like this TV. The sound is great, from its built in speakers. I used it a few years before I got the HD cable box, even better after that. In 8 years, one repair. Like someone else reviewed, the only drawback is the joystick button of the remote control; after 8 years this just went out (surprised it lasted that long), still toggles in 4 positions, but CANNOT push down to ""enter"" anymore. Luckily, one can access the Input Selections from the front of the TV as well, not in the instructions. No part number on the remote or in the manual, tough to even find correct replacement. Luckily, I have a Samsung DVD recorder, and later found that I can set that to ""TV"" and then use its Input Select buttons, better design (it is a few years newer, doesn't have the joystick). I have not tried a ""universal"" remote yet to see if I can access the Input, don't need to; actually the DVD remote pretty much erases need now to use the TV remote for daily use."
3,Really So Rare?,"Is this movie really so rare? I can't believe that one of my favorite early Sunday morning ""creature feature"" classics is now so hard to find! Haven't found a copy to evaluate, hence only ""3"" stars, but would like to. For those who may not remember, a great circa 1950's Sci-Fi flick, with space-travelers stranded on a space station that becomes host to an invasive species. Kind of like ""Alien,"" only this alien is an infectious moss brought on board by a traveler who succumbs, then the entire space station crew must fight for survival as the moss grows and grows . . . For special effects and horrific scenes, this one certainly rates higher than many of the B-grade dogs (like the original ""Thing,"" or ""It"" for instance) that have been re-released. Would love to see a nice re-issue come out someday."
5,Who in the world has this movie?! Please HELP!,"William Leslie (the star) is my Grandfather. Since he just passed away in December, I am trying to gather together as many of his old movies as I can. This one has been impossible to find. If anyone could help me out I would really appreciate it. Also, I am looking for a movie called,""The Couch"" and another called, ""The Night the World Exploded"". PLEASE HELP!"
2,Sonically: Just a CD not DSD,"For someone looking for an audiophile version of this recording, this SACD release is a misrepresentation. As the liner notes state, the source is a 44.1 KHz 24 bit digital recording made in 1998. So, the sampling rate here cannot capture the timbre of the violin nor the spatial staging. You do get 5+1 channels, which is nice. DGG has put out a lot of SACDs whose sources are at most 96KHz and not DSD, which is a shame since that's all that was in the original. It would be more truthful if some kind of labeling warned the buyer that this is not a DSD recording and won't have the fidelity of DSD."
2,Underwhelming,"Although I am still glad I bought the book, I was pretty disappointed in a few ways. The book is at least as much a corporate history of Stinson Aircraft as it is about the airplanes themselves. There was decent coverage of the early aircraft types, but the later Stinson Reliant and Voyager types were glossed over. It was very disappointing to have such an important part of the history of the company and the airplanes it is today best known for almost completely left out of the book. I don't think that two pages for the entire series of Gullwing Stinson Reliants was anywhere close to adequate. The book is worth it if for no other reason than it is the only book on Stinson Aircraft on the market, but if there were any other options I would not recommend buying it."
3,Reads like a script,"The plot is interesting, but the writing is more scriptlike than good literature. I wish that I had just waited to see the movie rather than taken the time to read this book."
3,Intresting but...,"I wanted to know more about this scandel but this book didn't go into the details I would have wanted. It's a movie book, and those as a rule are boring."
4,nice clean read,"this was a nice read. i had read the authors previous work ""the rosary"" and decided to read this one as well. i liked the fact that it was a romance without the sex."
4,The Mistress of Shenstone,"Florence Barclay has once again succeeded in bringing the era of earlier times to our reading pleasure.Although the story-line was slightly dragged out a little, it was a truly remarkable tale of tragedies we often endure but that he 'silver lining' is often there when we least expect it but we also have to be aware of it when it happens. As humans, we often muddle things up.Florence write in a lot the same manner as Jane Austen and does it well."
2,disappointing,"There are a couple of segments in this video that I have not seen before. The TV segment is interesting but very poor quality. There is also a studio segment in which the quality is a bit better. The live performances (in Japan) are excerpts from another video with Carlos Santana, Steve Lukather, Buddy Miles, and others. Since that I already own that video, there was little new for me on this one. I gave this a 2 star rating because of the poor quality of the British TV segment and the fact that most of the performances are duplicative of the other DVD. I have been a JB fan since he did that bridge raking of the strings on ""I'm a Man"" with the Yardbirds, but I would have passed on this one had I known its content.Bill"
3,For rockhounds.,"I got it from a rock and mineral show.60 pages. 8.5 X 5.5 X 0.25 inch.Published in 1965.Original price back then was (as printed on it) $1.25.Starts with simple introduction about the science then starting from page 37 up to 59 the Fluorescent minerals (Blue: Amber, Benitoite, Calcite .... Orange, Yellow, Gold: Anglesite, Barite, Calcite, ...) short information about each one.I don't know how many stars to give it because I was not really in the field, so I gave it 3 stars."
2,Great book but kindle edition riddled with typos,"I read the paperback edition years ago and loved it. I leant that to a friend and never saw it again, so when I decided to re-read the series I figured I'd give the kindle edition a go. I was very disappointed to find that it (and the previous book in the series) are chock full of typos.Judging by all the errors I'd say the process for creating the kindle edition is to scan the paperback edition and run those images through a third rate piece of OCR software. Here are but a few examples from the kindle edition: ""hp"" instead of ""lip"", ""stem"" instead of ""stern"", ""Utter"" instead of ""Litter"".It really is a shame because as I said, the book is great and an enjoyable read, but all the mistakes in the kindle edition really detract from it.Skip the kindle edition and buy the paperback"
4,Great book--,"I loved this book. I think that Arithon is much more interesting than Lysaer, who has become a pompous arse. Arithon's struggle to accommodate his loss of Mage sight is courageous, along with his determine to follow the MasterBard's wishes to go to his family and tell his story.The Fellowship of Seven, although sneaky, are a lot of fun to read about. The way they are written about makes me able to see them while I read.This is a great series--and although it did take me a while to get started--it is truly worth the effort, because the majority of the book moves very quickly."
5,a fantastic toy.,"My 3-year-old and I have a great time building castles with this set. In fact, I think I enjoy it more that he does! As with all Duplo bricks, we can augment this set with other bricks to make bigger (and sometimes more colorful) castles.While this is a great set for the money, my son wants to make a castle that HOLDS the included Dragon (a la Shrek), and we'll need to buy the larger set to accommodate him. You may decide to buy the larger castle and the dragon separately if you want to give your dragon a castle home with the appropriate elbow room. =)"
1,dont waste your money,This isn't my first dome so operator error is not the issue. First time setting this up the screening on the upper left side just opened up like a zipper. Its not true no seeum netting its some fish net looking weave and the material is weak. Thanks to a roll of duct tape we didn't get any large bugs in but we had some tiny ones that were able to get by weave of the netting. The configuration of the shoe ports are a total waste. The space it wastes could have been put to better use by just leaving the square design alone and the threshold door mat is nothing more than a gimmick. Waste of time and money. I've been camping for well over 30 years and most of that is from a back pack so this isn't from a week end warrior car camper.
3,Great for the once a year camper!,"The product was delivered quickly. Very Spacious, and alot of room for the price! Had a couple eye holes come off no big deal. tent looked a little confusing to put together, but a simple scan of the directions and it was up in no time."
3,Doesn't like persperation nor showers.,"Does what it is supposed to do regarding the nicotine. I used Nicoderm (6 weeks)for step one. Never had but one fall off and it was on over 24 hours. I run and cycle and sometimes have to shower with a patch on (I would put a little cloth first aid tape around the edges). I used Rite Aid patches for step two and have had to tape a couple of them on to complete the 24 hour period. I am now in the last week of step three and am using Nicoderm patches for this step. Rite Aid Nicotine Transdermal System patches did work for the purpose they were purchased and cost a little less. But, for active people, I recommend Nicoderm CQ."
4,Great Sound,"This speaker has a great sound, with a compact footprint. I love it, as it also matches my existing Infinity and JBL surround sound speakers....."
1,Bad Amplifier,First amplifier burned up in the middle of the night after 1 year. filled the house with burning smell. sent it in for repair. second anplifier burned up the same in the middle of the night. started making loud noise and scared the begevers out of me. very bad amp design.
2,SOUNDS GOOD SHORT LIFE,Great sound for the short life it has. Turned up not even half way had my house shaking for off and on for about 20hrs of use then just clicking. Opened it up to see what was going on and a lot of heat and nowhere for it to go!!! (VERY POOR COMPONETS)!!!
5,Clean Sub,"Excellent sub. Tried several others ad this by far is the cleanest. Solid low end to my polk surround sattelites. Sub that came with the Polk system was unacceptable. Great deal from J&R Music World, $159 with free ship or Amazon for $167 free ship. Best Buy sells for $279-get a grip."
3,"Sounds great, until the amplifier burns out","I've owned the JBL sub 10 venue series subwoofer for about one year. Absolutely love it, and great value for the price. BUT today listening at a very low volume, the amplifier burned out. This part is $212 to replace, as the whole amplifier unit is sold together, not JUST the digital amplifier part, which is what burned out. Word of advice: keep your receipt!"
2,Loud and sloppy - you get what you pay for,"I think this is a worth while sub for the price. It has lots of power and the bass *will* make your windows vibrate. I characterize it as loud and sloppy - which is similar to other subs in this price range.I would have given this device three stars, except I have had a few issues with the two I have owned. The speaker ripped or came apart on the first model I purchased from Bestbuy. The replacement lasted for a year or so before it's electronics actually fried and smoked, filling my apartment with the acrid smell of burning electronics. This happened while it was in sleep mode and not in use...?If you are looking for an inexpensive and loud sub, I still would not pass this one up. However the 8"" Polk Audio sub I now use seems to have a much tighter, less flabby sound, with all the power."
4,Smooth Bass,"This is a 300W Sub not a 250W Sub. It doesn't shake the windows in the room but provides good sounding bass for films, music and games without requiring any adjusting for listening to the various sources. It also comes with the Sub cable which is at least a $15 savings. It also matches very well with the other JBL speakers that I've used to make my system. Again this sub is great as long as you don't want to hear every bolt rattling in your home."
1,Failed after 1 hr,"I was happy after listening my new sub, however, after 1 hr of usage it suddenlly began to produce a punching sound like a constant hit. Dissapointed by JBL. My old and low level Onkyo continues serving me pretty well....."
2,you get what you paid for...,"The USB vehicle charger stopped working after a week of mild use. However, the USB home wall charger works well. Overall, not worth your money."
3,Not so bad,This book is full of very good advice and I'm sure that it will work if properly applied. He asks his readers to find some pretty hard to find ingredients - at least in this area. And finding a doctor to perform some of the tests he recommends is equally difficult. I just don't know if this is a plan that can be used by someone of moderate income.
2,"Not much new, hard to cook this way for families","There is a lot of useful information in this book, but I agree that this is a rehash of the ""Neanderthin"" plan. Everything was going along well until I got to the recipes and eating plans. Gimme a break! Not practical at all unless you're single or the whole family gets on board, because there's some strange stuff here. If you're prepared to double your grocery bill at health and specialty food stores, go for it. My traditional family would be willing to make a few concessions, but hitting the ground running with this book would get me banned from the kitchen..."
5,About Health not just Weight Loss,"I think the subtitle of this book takes our attention away from what it's really about. What's it really about? Paying attention to your body: what you put into it, what you get out of it, and the messages it is sending you about how it is functioning and what it needs. If you are overweight, and you learn the lessons of this book, you will lose weight (I've lost 20 pounds, thus far), but that will probably be only one of the results you'll notice. You'll feel better physically, mentally, and emotionally because you will be treating your body with respect and it will be treating you well in return.If you are looking for a quick and easy way to lose weight, this book will probably disappoint you. If you are looking to make real changes to better your overall health and help you live a longer, happier life, then this book is exactly what you need.By the way, Dr. Hyman's work is based on the latest and best scientific/medical research. It's not some wacky fad."
5,Ultrametabolism - excellent information,This books is easy to read and makes so much sense! I do not need to lose weight but want to eat healthier. Great information.Why are so many people so fat? Mark Hyman makes a great case for why.I took his advice and feel so much better.
5,It now makes so much sense!,"This books answered a lot of questions about why I feel they way I do (sluggish) and why my body looks the way it does (bloated). About 2 weeks after starting Phase I of the diet I noticed a difference in my midsection. I had become leaner. And I noticed an increase in my energy level too. A well-written learning tool, that's for sure!"
3,A New Presentation of Centuries Old Principles That Work,"I like the fact that newcomers to the healthy lifestyle will have this book as an option in their search for guidance.Nothing new except for the title and style. These principles have been presented before, many times & they will continue to be written about - and that's ok because the need for this info will ALWAYS exist. These strategies do work - plain and simple.Those that follow them usually find success.Joey Atlas - The Wizard of Fitnesswww.AbsOfStoneCoreOfSteel.comwww.ButtHipAndThighMakeover.com"
3,Yet another diet book,"The hype is all for eating sensibly and this book is more of the same in different words. It's a lot to read to distill the information that eating a balanced diet (vegetables, grains, fish, poultry and meat) in smaller portions will create weight loss, also taking in less calories than you espend will help your weight loss. The metabolic explanation is very unclear to me but I could ask an endocrinologist."
2,Purely Theoretical,"This book is highly theoretical. I presume the author believes that humans can no longer evolve. We have certainly evolved to eat everything Dr. Hyman says to eat...many years ago. But how about now? What's to say our bodies can't accept new types of food? If you want results, exercise is still a quick way to receive them. It's also healthy for you in many areas of your physiology. I did get some good pointers for supplements. But I think that's it. Again, purely theoretical writing on Dr. Hyman's part."
4,Its a little too complicated.,I love the whole premise and I am following it and feel better but it needs better guidelines for amounts I ate too many nuts at firstIt was a bit too complicated and I never read it cover to cover but appreciate that you can lose weight this way. I shared it with a half a doz friends all of which are trying the diet too. My neighbor and I are taking turns cooking from it and then sharing the meals with each other. That way we don't have to cook every night of the week. This is really nice for us retirees who don't cook all that much anymore anyway. My husband has lost the most weight and continues to lose. The hardest part for him is to give up alcohol.
2,Ultra waste of money,"The CD version of the book is not very informative and is very repetitive. After listening to it, I only had a vague idea of what to do to follow the author's dietary guidelines. The only thing I took away from it was to avoid high fructose corn sweetener and trans fats--duh. Save your money and your time. Pass on this one.Dr. Robins"
5,Outlines good diet and exercise,A lifestyle plan that doesn't promise any magic bullets but outlines good diet and exercise in a straightforward fashion.
1,saw this guy on Martha - sugar doesn't cause ADHD,"saw this guy on Martha - sugar doesn't cause ADHDhe's not a good scientist. so many of the claims he makes are overblown to give heft to his arguments. too much extrapolation - takes a simple point or statement about one group and applies to everyone when not appropriate...finally, he presents NOTHING NEW in this book"
3,Ultrametabolism Review,The book is very informative. I wish all doctors would share Mark Hyman's philosophies. We would be much healthier and become a drug free society!!
1,doesn't get to the point,"I borrowed the book from the library. Most of the book is fluff, simply filling out space to sell a book. The writer just doesn't state the point in a simple comprehensive easy to follow plan. I can not sift through the stories and I don't care to. I want a manual not a story book."
2,Gift,Gift for a friend. Refereed to this book as a good book for loosing weight and balancing the metabolism and heart health
5,I've acheived UltraMetabolism,"As a Ph.D. myself, I appreciated Dr. Mark Hyman's approach to better health. I've been following the progam for 2-1/2 months now and have lost approximately 20 lbs. and 3 in. around my waist. The program is not difficult to understand or follow, nor is it excessively expensive. I feel better and look better just because Dr. Hyman guided me through what to eat, how to eat, and when to eat. I highly recommend this book and the UltraMetabolism life."
3,Inconsistant,"This book is very informative, backed up by scientific evidence and personal experience. But, it says basically the same thing as ""Neanderthin"" did years ago, i.e. that foods of ""technology"" are bad. Also, Dr. Hyman points out (correctly) that many people have soy allergies, yet his example of the Phase I diet is loaded with soy products! To sum up, eat slowly, eat early, if man created it don't eat it, get some exercise, plenty of sleep and give up the common vices. Surprise, surprise."
5,I highly recommend his book,"I am an RD and a CDN. I first listened to Dr. Hyman's speech when he had a special promotion on PBS. I was inspired by his knowledge and since then I read Dr. Hyman's books. I learned some important medical information which related to nutrition, and that helped me when I do nutrition consulting to my patients. However; Dr Hyman does not totally agree with the guideline of American Dietetic Association. Therefore, the nutritionists have to use his statement carefully."
5,Best Diet Book,"There is a new scientific discovery that genes are not ""set"" but are interactive based on certain environmental conditions- including diet. Hence, this book reveal, one can activate one's own genes to lose weight or to store fat and gain weight. This book, of course, demonstrates how to make the genes activate such that the body loses weight."
2,its ok but did not change my life,I read the book and it was ok. The problem I find with alot of these booksis the fact that it is hard to apply them to daily life. The food requiredis not ordinary food but difficult to obtain and my other family membersdon't like it. I would like a book that is easy to apply to my life now.If it is too exotic I don't have time to learn or to apply it and no onein my family is interested either.
3,"Useful, but boring","Ok, so it says it is not a ""diet"" book. Then it better be useful, and it better be interesting. The book fails on part two: it's full of useful information but is not as entertaining and easy to read as the YOU books by Dr. Oz. Ultrametabolism is ultra bo-ring."
4,"The more you know, the better",I bought this book for all the women in my family. We all have dealt with weight problems throughtout our lives and I had seen this Author on the View. I was impressed with what he had to say in that short amount of time and wanted to know more.
4,A health plan that could work if followed,"Recommend it to all looking for a plan to better their health situation, if followed."
3,Pretty good read,A very informative book. Lots of interesting statistics. A good reminder of what type of diet is good for weight loss and overall wellbeing. I found lots of useful information in the book. It is an easy read. I finished the book in 2 days. The doctor is a wonderful author and writes in a manner that is easily understood. I began his program and dropped 12 pounds in 2 weeks.
5,Ultra Metabolism Review,"Ultra Metabolism is easy to read and understand. It not only talks about losing weight but the obstacles (and their solutions) people face when losing weight. It gives meal plans and recipes as well as personal experiences. As one of those people who 'just can't lose weight' I have already lost 4-5 pounds. More than just losing weight, with the change in diet my migraines have also become almost non existent! I highly recommend Ultra Metabolism."
5,Nutrition knowledge is golden,"Even if you don't want or need to to lose weight, please read this book. Dr. Hyman explains how food works with our bodies. Everyone should know."
4,"Not much new, but helpful info overall","Good advice ~ some of it very standard: stick with organic when you can; eat whole, real foods, not processed ones; etc. Great info on inflammation, sugar intake, and supplements. Best if used in conjunction with appropriate tests for blood sugar, blood pressure, etc. to see results. Very accessible for anyone new to this kind of information - could be a nice intro for a family member or friend, if you're already familiar with this kind of eating/living."
3,Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss (Purchased on 05/07/2011) by Mark Hyman M.D.,"This book had some good information and recipes but overall it was impractical for me. The plan involved buying exotic ingredients (expensive) and throwing out a lot of stuff. It also involves a lot of time spent cooking, which I don't have."
5,Dramatic lowering of cholesterol,"This book is the real deal. I've tried many other health diet books' approaches to lowering cholesterol; this one is the only one that has delivered on its claims. Following the menus in this book (almost religiously), I lowered my cholesterol from 411 to 220 in 2 months time! My alternative medicine doctor doesn't necessarily agree w/ Dr. Hyman's exhortation to avoid stevia and xylitol (ok to use in moderation), and I'm not sure about his negative comments regarding flour (especially since some of the recipes call for soy flour; I like to grind my own), but aside from these minor quibbles, I highly recommend this book. If you are interested in good health and don't mind making a little (not a lot!) of effort and exercising a bit of discipline in how you eat, this book is a must read."
4,ultrametabolism,"comprehensive and concise, one of those books that you wish you had read first. Easy to follow in laymens terms. Author tends to hammer his point in, which i found annoying after a while yet for anyone who isn't familiar with the material, i am sure it would shorten the learning curve. Conservative though cutting edge, not in the least sensationalized. The tools that accompany the book online are excellent as well."
3,OK,"I have read a lot of diet books, this one has some different perspectives on different diets and recommends a lot of unprocessed foods, but it lacks realism as it bans artificial sweeteners and also sugar so I guess you are never supposed to eat anything sweet again. Also the book tends to drag and is hard to finish."
2,Platitudes and anecdotes,"The secret of dieting is provided by the author on pages 159 and 160 -1. ""There is one thing that ... significantly extends our life span, and causes us to lose weight. What is it? Calorie restriction!""2. ""Besides eating breakfast, exercise is the only thing that has been correlated with long-term, sustained weight loss.""Those are not the words of a cynical reviewer. Those are direct quotes from the author. If you have never read a diet book and have no clue what comprises a healthy diet, then this book may be of some help. Otherwise, there is nothing new and some dubious suggestions backed by zero scientific research. Rather, they are presented as, ""comprehensive medical and clinical perspectives"". I also reserve a healthy dose of scepticism for any book presenting a note from the author that impies there is a vast medical, government and food industry conspiracy to keep us ignorant while only the author is prepared to reveal this ""hidden knowledge""."
2,Confusing detox instructions,"I bought both this book and ""The Detox Box."" I was psyching myself up to do at least one week of the detox program but have found that the instructions in ""Ultrametabolism"" are at odds with those that come on the cards in ""The Detox Box.""The cards list foods to be avoided in the detox stage. Among these are protein (except fish), citrus fruits (except lemons) and soy.However, the book has a list of foods to enjoy in Phase I (detox) which includes oranges, lamb, chicken, turkey and soy nuts (see pp.243-247). The book also has some suggested recipes for Phase I which include all of above as ingredients (see pp.252-272).This seems to me to be a major error on the part of the publisher or author."
3,I guess it's ok,"I was under the impression that it would be more everyday food informative. there are so many references to wierd hard to find foods, that only a person with a lot of time on their hands can make a good use out of this book. Also many ""facts"" are author personal opinions, which seem just as dubious as myths he is trying to destroy."
2,Yet Another 8 Week Plan!,"It wasn't surprising to see another diet book with an 8 week plan to ""finally"" get you on the right track. Well, I've followed the plan since April, and the results? Not much of a difference. I lost 4 pounds, but other diets have done that for me, and I feel good, but ensuring I get regular exercise does the same. If you're like me and have tried a dozen others, you might as well try it. No magic bullet here, but there is some practical advice."
2,Ultrametabolism,This book could have been written in about 10 pages as it continually refers to the website so that you can find more in-depth information about just about anything he refers to. Seems to be more of an advertisement for his website than about healthy living and some of his suggestions - buy only organic for instance would be ideal in a perfect world but guess what we don't live in a perfect world. Not as much substance as I was hoping for and I was disappointed in the content.
4,it explains why,"to be honest i bought this book 2 years ago.. i think. i never followed the plan (it had to do with bad relationship with food) and anyway i didn't need to considering my weight. So I cannot tell if it works. The reason why i write this review is because, it is one of the few books that explain why we need to eat healthy. For example, it explains why taking some supplements and what do we achieve by protecting our mitochondria. i have to say i was impressed. It was not only about diet advice and what to do or what not to do. It is about nutrition. Most diet books would say do this and do that while they say general stuff. they will mention metabolism but not exactly what is going on on a micro level. So this book gives a glimpse of what is going on with our body and why some people are obese.Very informative and i just happen to love learning."
4,A Simple Plan,"The advantages of this diet are many- it seems to work, the food is very healthful and delicious , you can serve the same meals to yourself and the entire family , and you do not feel hungry or deprived. In fact you feel happy and satisfied and as if you have taken conrol of your life in a positive way."
3,diet,It is a way of living that one must be ready to committ to or it will fall by the wayside since it takes committment to follow it.
3,Great if you've got the money.,"My issues with this are the same as Suzanne Sommers' books. They're great with great info if you can afford to shop at Whole Foods and have a gold-plated government health policy that pays for all kinds of tests. If you're the rest of us in the real world that have to live on a budget - outta luck.For the rest of us that aren't TV stars, CEO's or doctors the only useful info we can live with is eat more veggies, good fats and interval train an hour a day, five days a week. Actually, anyone that follows that advice will lose weight - and that's the big kicker. While he criticizes doctors for saying 'eat less, exercise more,' the real truth is that he advocates just that, with the only difference of 'eat better, eat less, exercise more.'"
3,Worth the listen,This audio is packed with good information but the plan is too extreme for most anybody to follow. Yes! you will lose weight if you eat like a caveman ... I think most people figured that out on their own. Its hard to take advice from someone who has never been overweight. It does however give detailed information how the body uses different foods and what to avoid in your diet. Worth it if you want to loose weight or just want to eat healthier. I used bit and pieces of this info with my own exercise plan to loose my last 25 lbs. and at age 50 I feel great at my desired weight!
3,Ultrametabolism & Never ending promotions,"I found this book hard to read due to the constant references to otherbooks, programs and Media supporting the doctors who have researchedthis subject. The substance was hard to find and required alot of mentalfiltering but it is there. I wish there were more testimonials frompatients or doctors that had real biological changes to report. Maybethere will be a rivised edition...who knows."
5,Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss,This book was published prior to the Ultra Simple Diet and goes into more detail about causes of obesity and toxicity. It is pretty much the same program as the other but the book includes (besides some very good information)some very good recipes!I was very successful in improving my health by following Dr. Hyman's guidelines.
5,"Ultra Metabolism, Dr. Mark Hyman","This book was amazing!! I don't have a specific health problem nor do I have a significant amount of weight to lose. I purchased the book after seeing Dr. Hyman on tv and had been looking for a different way of eating to be healthy and drop 5 lbs. Well it worked! I lost 5 lbs in the first 2 weeks and feel fantastic! I love the fact that I'm never hungry and have tons more energy. Even my horrific PMS symptoms have gone away. I realized after reading & starting to eat the way Dr. Hyman recommends, I was eating way too many carbs, sugar and ""empty"" foods. I now either eat no carbs or very little depending on the day. I read all labels when I grocery shop looking only for natural ingredients. I've added good fats and got rid of all the ""low"" ""no"" fat foods in my house. I cannot say enough great things about this book. I recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their weight down or just wants to start feeling good."
2,"Blah, Blah, again!","This book reads as bad as the Ultra-simple Diet by same auther. I found it frustrated me more than anything. Way to wordy, I just want to be told what needs to be done to achieve my weight loss goals, to speed up my metabolism. It eventually gets to it, but by that time you don't care."
1,DO NOT buy the digital download version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,You cannot print this out so that you can...say read it before bed or in teh tub. You are STUCK reading it on your computer screen. BS!! This is not stated anywhere when you make the purchase.
1,This was a HUGE was of my time,I thought this book would provide information about the glycemic index and portion size. Boy was I wrong. Let's see...only eat veggies and the occasional fish and you'll lose weight. WHAT A SURPRISE!!! So if I don't eat bread or fat or sugar or the most evil of evils (according to this guy) high fructose corn syrup I'll lose weight. REALLY?! This is basically a book on how to be a vegetarian but you apparently can eat cold water fish and somehow that doesn't count as meat. Don't waste your time.
5,Masterpiece of minimalism,"Le Samourai is a masterpiece of minimalism and existential cool with wonderful images and a cool jazz sound score and Jean-Pierre Melville's always excellent aesthetic sense. Alain Delon is absolutely perfect as the death-driven lone wolf Jeff Costello. He is silent for most of the film, but his eyes and iconic, precise acting style convey such a lot. His performance is very well contrasted by the much more loquacious Inspector on the hunt played by Francois Perier. The isolation and doom-laden claustrophobia of Costello's life are counterpointed by great moments of suspense and intrigue - such as the chase on the Paris Metro! As ever, the Criterion collection shows great taste in selecting such works and the DVD offers good context with interviews and further comment. An absolute must for fans of Jean-Pierre Melville!"
5,"The best ""action"" film of all time!","Melville's cool direction and Delon's cool acting come together perfectly in this truly groundbreaking movie. Melville's sense of detail rivals that of Robert Bresson, every shot is finely crafted. Delon's acting is brilliant, although the character does not say much - we get a sense of what he is thinking and who he is through his actions. This hired killer is, surprisingly, the most likeable person in the film. Like most great films, the ending is an open parable. We would like to think Jef's gun was left empty on purpose and that his gesture was a sort of ritualistic suicide (the samurai theme) - but we cannot know this for certain."
2,Only for Delon fans,"As I stated in my title, this dvd is ONLY FOR DELON FANS. That being said,I found the film extremely slow, with a lot of ""repetitive"" parts, like the sequence on the subway. Also, I couldn't get, why, did Delon used gloves to hide his fingerprints, and at the same time kills his victim, at a Club filled with guests, where anybody could see him. His suits and shoes, are of an extreme fashion design, but at the same time, he lives in a horrible (dump), apartment. This is a film, with a very unsatisfying ending, where one finishes the story with a lot of why this or why that....I agree with one of the reviewers above, the best acting came from...yes you guessed it...the bird in the cage. SKIP IT."
2,Le Boring,"I think there was packaging or a sticker that compared this film to Pulp Fiction. As if. Beyond minor superficial similarities - I dont see it.Le Samurai is one of the most boring films Ive watched recently without turning it off. In retrospect I wish I had turned it off or never wasted my time since the ending is so dull.Imagine if breathless had a slightly more complicated plot, but the main character had no charisma. Or if Alphaville (the film not the treatment) was more 100 times more boring. Le Samurai makes Tokyo Drifter seem like a thrill ride. I was not impressed by this film on any level.If you are into being bored. Or if your so freaking smart you can watch paint drying and fill it with significance, this is the film for you."
5,Le Samourai,"Seminal gangster movie homage combines elements of Kurosawa and American film noir to create a spare film strikingly short on dialogue. Delon is ideal for the role of Jef, as his surface male beauty amplifies the character's underlying moral and emotional vacuum. Behind those icy, classic features, you glimpse nothing but oblivion. (Note: Delon's wife Nathalie plays Jane, who furnishes Jef's alibi)."
5,Does It Get Any better Then This,No film has had more of an impact on my sense of what works in cinema then this gem. The editing is genius.
5,psychological thriller,"This is the movie that made Delon a legend in Europe, it is also one the most perfect films ever made, in my humble opinion. I can remember one or two other movies where at the end, I felt entirely thrilled at the full circle of the story. Absolutely brilliant, and hugely influential."
5,A gangster-film landmark,"Alain Delon sets the standard for ""cool killer"" characters in film. His performance marks the beginning of gangster as fashion icon, paving the way for Beatty & Dunaway in ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".Melville directs with fantastic visual flair and provides a great twist ending, too."
4,Ice leads to fire.,"Perhaps had I seen ""Le Samourai"" before the film it inspired, John Woo's ""The Killer"", I would have been more impressed. Alain Delon's Jeff Costello is cold, an automaton, and it is left as an exercise to the viewer to imagine the depths of suffering which might have caused a man to turn to ice. By contrast, Chow Yun-Fat's John Chow is warm, human in his joy and suffering and, in my opinion, a more well-rounded and interesting character.If you are interested in the history of film this is definitely one to watch; its impact on later films is undeniable. As a matter of sheer film euphoria though, ""The Killer"" (especially the uncut version) is much more satisfying in its depth and beauty."
5,A great film but a slightly disappointing DVD from Criterion,"Le Samourai, Jean-Pierre Melville's riff on This Gun For Hire, is another of Criterion's slightly disappointing recent discs. The film is superb and the extras are okay but not outstanding (Melville trying a little too hard not to blame rival studios for the fire that destroyed his own studio during filming is the highlight) but the transfer, while acceptable, is nowhere near the standard of the deleted French DVD, or even the Russian one for that matter, both of which are much sharper. It's still a great exercise in pure filmmaking, but I'm glad I didn't trade in the French PAL disc, which boasts superior picture quality, before seeing this transfer."
4,They just don't make them like this anymore,"There is actually little mystery and it's not exactly a thriller;however, it is a fantastic movie experience that has style. I am not sure how the director pulled it off - there is always a feeling of something is about to happen and it might or it might not - you just don't know and that is a great idea in this movie. Sometimes it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Sometimes it just slowly simmers and leaves you with questions about a particular character, but all in all - I am happy to have this cool movie in my collection."
2,Very average,"Vulture St is far from a must-have album. It is an uninspired and boring listen. There are a couple of OK songs (Sunsets, Roll Right By You), but as a previous reviewer has mentioned, it all blends into each other, nothing reaches out and grabs you like most of Internationlist did. How Far Have We Really Come is a laughable attempt at a John Lennon styled political song. Stumblin sounds like a substandard ACDC song that didnt make the cut.Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,"Powdering, the 'stadium rock' band","Seems these days every man and his dog wants to 'rock out'. You don't get street cred being a ballad singer do ya? But Bernard Fanning's vocals aren't really suited stadium-rock, at least, the band shouldn't rest their laurels on it.Maybe everyone can be a rock-legend. Imagine Bob Dylan or Michael Buble putting rings in their nose, getting on stage in leather pants and trying to deliver Metallica influenced metal?But anyway, it works fairly well here because the band's songwriting and musicianship were excellent. They're not going to really knock you out too often, because this hard rock is not their strongest point, though excellent anthems like 'Sunsets', 'Baby I've got you on my mind', 'Love your way' and 'A song called everything' stand as some of their best ever. Rating **3/4, or 2.75"
4,No Vultures circling these lads.,"When this album dropped through my door on its release date, I spun it with great anticipation, and was disapointed, I suppose I was expecting another Odyssey #5 and that this aint, however, 2 or 3 plays later and it was cemented as one of the years favourites for me, an obvious return to classic Aussie Pub-rock but brilliantly done with exceptionally strong songs. There isnt a dud on the whole album and I love the art work as well. Too many standout tracks to list. These lads play a mean live set as well, and I hope for many more albums from them of this quality."
1,Crap.,"An album so unoriginal, uninspired and just downright bad that your ears will saw themselves off your head, a la 'Reservoir Dogs', just so they can crawl away and throw themselves into the garbage disposal.Assorted Powderfinger yokels, I'm ashamed to have been born in the same state as you. You're playing music that was old even in the seventies. And Bernard Fanning: for the love of God, grab yourself a thesaurus and try and write a different song."
1,Flea factory - what a DOG!,"As a lifelong lover of sci-fi cinema and literature, when I first saw the trailers the summer before it's release, I was extremely motivated to go see this movie ... I should've quit while I was ahead. With Sam Neil, Laurence Fishburne and Kathleen Quinlan on the cast list, plus a viually apparent huge special effects budget, you are suckered into believing that a film like this couldn't possible take a wrong turn. But it takes so MANY wrong turns, it runs itself over, again and again and again: this is a sure-fire DOA. Please, save yourself not only the money, but the time! Remember time is your only true non-renewable resource - once spent, you NEVER get it back. So please don't waste yours on this one, the biggest dog in space."
1,THIS MOVIE WAS VERY DISAPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I rented this because I have seen every good movie I wanted to see, and from there where do you go? Down! It was a while till I resorted to watching this atrosity of a movie. I didn't stop watching it because I can't stand walking out on any movie, but I should have in this case! It had no good point, was nasty, and an unsettling ending. I would not recomend seeing it, let alone buying it."
5,Awesome Sci-Fi classic from my youth!,"My friends and I used to love this movie. Was awesome to add it to the collection! ""Do you SEEEEEE??!?!?!"" haha, sam neill. Classic role."
2,not as scary or compelling as it thinks it is.,"Not a bad story, but I felt the ending wasn't as strong as it could have been. I mean, it's a tall order when you're told (and I'm paraphrasing) ""I'm going to show you hell"", so at that point, I was curious how the film was going to show me. And I thought, ""ooh, they're trying real hard to scare me"" rather than ""wow, I'm actually scared""! Nice try, though."
4,Event Horizon,When I first saw previews for this movie I didn't think I was going to like it. So I didn't even bother attemting to see it. I was taking to one of my friends about movies and since she knows what kind of movies I like to watch she told me about this movie. I honestly jumped out of my seat on a couple parts of the movie. The special effects are great & they casted great people for the leads. I'm really glad that I watched this movies. It's now one of my top favorite movies to watch.
3,Event Horizon:Scary Type of Space,"This film came out two weeks after Spawn,but I remember seeing posters for it maybe 3 weeks before the august 15th release date in 1997. when me and father went to go see it(I think I was 13)the theater was packed.Long story short,Event Horizon has an ominous beginning with the musical score and title credits.Still,it had the classic set-up of a ghost ship story(though this ship in set in space).I did not really jump out of my seat like the other audiences,but indeed found myself disturbed at the gory scenes(one particularly eerie scene is when Sam Neill's Weir is in an air condition like duct and the lights keep flashing on and off,till he sees an image of his dead wife).True, it dosen't let you know what really happened to E.H. until halfway through,and the cast is somewhat on point(given the material).If you don't like scary jolters,best stay away from Event Horizon."
4,A Good Follow-up For Event Horizon Fans,"This is a well-made sci-fi horror film standing out in a genre where so few of them make much of an impact beside great ones like Alien. The cast is strong, portraying well scripted characters. The horror is constant and genuinely creepy throughout. I can't think of too many other sci-fi horror films that do a better job.As far as the Special Edition is concerned, fans of the movie such as myself, will be pleased at the amount of attention spent on a movie over ten years old. Film documentary watchers will have plenty to watch and the deleted scenes are interesting to see without the special effects placed in. A good amount of content for film enthusiasts."
4,"Perfect Plot, Horrible Ending","I liked this movie a lot. In fact I liked it more that critically acclaimed horror movies like The Ring, Exorcist or Titanic. The Event Horizon, a high-tech spaceship has been found after it disappeared inexplicably years ago. A team led by Laurence Fishbrune is sent to investigate it. Once abroad the team is haunted by all sorts of spooky stuff and some of them go nuts. The brilliant premise for it was that the spaceship had turned into a kind of living entity which evolved a of self defence mechanism (kind of like in Sphere) which capitalised on the fears of the crew. However, the whole movie is spoiled by some sh*t about it being an incarnation of hell (oooh!!!). On the spook/scare value I found this movie to be much better that Alien (which is very much overrated). So don't give a forget about what stupid critics have to say about the character development and stuff like prolonged silences and go watch this immensely enjoyable horror movie."
2,DOWNHILL ...,"This must be one of those scripts that the actors read it, then say ""THis is bulshi..."", but accept the job, because they have their bills to pay! The movie starts very well, concentrating the audience's attention, then is all the way downhill, getting worser and worser. Sam Neill is laughable as the villain."
4,Super Idea And Great Production But Only Good Execution,"I thought seeing this on DVD after already seeing it in the theater might be a bit of an anti-climax. Actually it hits just as hard and is just as scary. Overall a really great idea and clean mix of horror and sci-fi (not AT ALL campy or plastic). A very serious film. Unfortunately the plot and editing seem to work against each other and some stuff gets lost in the shuffle. For those who haven't seen this, I'll try not to ruin things but when a lead character starts to go Jack Nicholson on the audience there doesn't appear to be any clear reason or any hint of why this is happening. A side shot at this reasoning would have been a great plot addition. So expect a few holes but overall a solid set of performances, script execution and awesome effects. Watch this one at night with the speakers up! It's also a definite see and see again."
2,Interesting premise but bad film.,"Someone told me the premise of the film (without revealing too much - after watching the movie I discovered that the movie doesn't reveal much). I thought the premise was pretty original, but the screenplay was horrible. I don't know what the talented actors in this film were thinking. I mean the screenplay was down right hideous. And the special effects looked like they were computer generated. What bothered me the most was that there was to explanation at the end. I'm a big fan of ambiguity in films when it's appropriate (I hate films that tell you too much and end up insulting your intelligence), but trust me it doesn't work for this film. I don't recommend it."
4,Could have been Great...,"This is one of my favorite movies in the horror/sci-fi genre. Event Horizon is a real good movie that could have been a great one if it weren't for the last quarter of the movie. The whole movie proceeds with the viewer wondering, 'what is happening?', 'What's causing all these strange occurrences?', 'Who will they encounter?' I sat there watching and waiting for the eventual meeting with the unknown. What did I get?? A video log of some kind of blood and gore-groupy-get-together and Sam Neil trying to play Hellraiser on a ship. Up until then I was chomping on my nails and on the edge of my seat. After that, well, Mr. Anderson, a fisherman could sum it up best: ""I let a good one get away."""
2,Very poor,"""How can we update the old haunted house/demonic possession/gory death/gotta get out of here storyline and convince people to buy tickets?"" ""I know - let's make the house a spaceship and the usual paranormal whacko ripe for possession is the guy that built the spaceship"" ""Cool - let's do it and if we title it Event Horizon, we can label it science fiction""Very poor reworking of the standard horror movie involving haunting/possession with a near criminal mis-labeling as science fiction. The only saving grace is the special effects..."
2,We didn't need this stinker on Blu-ray,"The first half of this movie is very good hard sci-fi. At midpoint though it takes an inexplicable turn. The 2nd half of the script/plot seems to be completely unfamiliar with the 1st half, as if they switched writers and revised the storyboard mid-stream. The 2nd half is worthy of the Cinematic Titanic treatment if they ever run out of material. I like sci-fi. I didn't like Event Horizon."
2,Still Yawning After This One...,I was not impressed with this movie at all. There were a few parts that had you somewhat on the edge of your seat but only a few. It started out like it would be a good movie. I give them credit for being somewhat original with the plot but I still found it to be a boring and strange movie. I would expect more from a space movie than a machine on a spaceship controlling minds and killing people. It seemed like they couldn't make up their mind if they wanted this to be a horror movie or a mystery suspense movie. In the end it just turned out to be a bad movie.
1,Open the black hole and throw this movie in it...,"A worthless piece of drek that had a intertesting premis or two that were totally wasted. When I stumble across movies like this I always wonder how hungry the pinciple players were and how the producers ever managed to get funding. It's a terrible combo/[imitaton] of ""Alien"" and ""Hellraisers"". Don't waste your time, electricity or wear and tear on your VCR or DVD player."
2,I Can't Believe I Paid for This,"After viewing this movie, I had a heated argument with my friend who said this movie was worth paying the rental fee. The plot was seriously lacking in structure and follow through- almost like throwing lots of little scenes together and hoping they make a high dollar movie. It reminded me of ""The Shining"" transported into space with less actual mind-bending horror and more unnecessary gore. The goriness of it gives it its redeeming qualities, as it is the only part of the movie that is REALLY scary besides that on scene that had suspense. If the film doesn't make you physically ill, it will make you ill temepered when you realized you PAID to see this."
1,not playable,Very disappointed in that the sound quality of this item is effectively non-existent. No amount of adjustment of my software and hardware would let me hear the audio. The data side of the disk had been circularly polished which casts doubt on the genuine-ness of the product. Caveat emptor.
4,A Sci-Fi Horror Favorite For All,"Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill star in this 1997 Sci-Fi horror film. It is some time in the not so distant future. A missing experimental ship known as the Event Horizon has appeared somewhere in the solar system near Pluto after years of mysteriously disappearing years ago. Dr. Weir (Sam Neill) had overseen the ships design and craft, yet has no explanation for the ship's unexplainable disappearance or re-appearance. All heck breaks lose when the ship comes alive and begins killing people. This movie is so scary you'll never forget it. Directed by Paul Anderson."
2,Not for Children,"This film is not for children! The images are so violent I think it should have been rated NC-17. It starts off as good science fiction. In fact, the modern physics I studied in school came in handy trying to understand how a ship could travel beyond what looked like the speed of light by bending space. However the film just falls apart as they seem to go beyond the universe. This is not even made clear. Sam Neill pulls out his eye balls and tells Laurence Fishburne something to the effect that where they are going is beyond hell and you don't need your eyes there. This is more horror than science fiction. This is NOT for CHILDREN!"
1,"Confusing, Disturbing, and Blood-Filled. Don't Watch It.","I really was hoping that I would like this movie, but I really didn't. When I rented Face/Off, which is a lot better, I got my hopes up when the preview came on. But the whole movie is a waste of time, and the stars' talent. And if you ask me, it really made Alien (a classic) look bad."
4,Excellent,I found that this film moved quickly and really kept me interested unlike many other sci-fi/horror films that tend to become slow from time to time. Cooper is extremely funny and Sam Neill plays his role very well. I own this movie and reccomend it to others.
4,in my top ten sci/fi thriller list,"this movie was amazing!!!the first time i saw it i was scared stiff afterwards, i couldn't sleep!!"

4,Excellent beyond expectations,"This is one of my favorite films of recent time. Along with PitchBlack, there are elements here which easily apply to the fundementals of fear and horror. While well equipped with its share of blood and distressed flesh, the primary element of horror is that it is largely unseen, or rather too large to be seen. The control is no longer in the characters hands, and quickly gathers momentum towards that abyss where fear and damnation is all consuming and enveloping.For those that like some thought in their movies and stories, this is for you...!!"
2,Disappointing. Things happened for no reason. No depth.,"I was disappointed in this movie. It could have been so much more. A guy goes through a black hole, we guess. He returns catatonic. So, what did he experience? We never find out. The ship is evilly alive(???). No explanation other than *it* went to the other side and returned that way. The alternate Universe is pure chaotic evil? Pure chaotic evil couldn't last. It makes no sense. What happened to the old crew? Only scattered fragments of illogically inane horror tell that story. Most of the crew dies, and I don't really care about anyone anyway. I end up rooting for the evil guy just because I like the actor."
2,from the director of Mortal Kobat,"this one is ok with some intense horror scenes but please..it runs out of steam way to early and we dont get that edge we need....Sam Neill at the end, I mean come on but Laurence Fishburne is great. not much fun on a planetary scale"
2,Event Horizon,"The plot is an amalgam of so many others such as Hellraiser, Alien, and Solaris. The acting is marginal at best, and the score is pretty cliched. However, I still enjoyed this movie for what it is: a pulp horror story. On that level, it works. Just don't expect anything deep or even clever."
3,Great space thriller,"It's OK of its kind: mysterious haunted ship, buckets of blood, and the hubristic scientist messing around with what ought not be messed with. The pieces add up one at a time as crew members are subtracted, also one at a time, and there's always another shock waiting.Effects are pretty good and the gorefest makeup is very good. Characters tend toward the one-dimensional, and lots of little things don't make lots of sense - that inexplicable but dramatically convenient pool of water around The Thingie being the least of it. But hey, it's just a spooky space movie. It's a pretty good spooky space movie. If that's the kind of thing you like, you'll like it.//wiredweird"
1,Money In / Junk Out,"Sam Neill, father figure of Dinsey proportions, is cast of the manifestation of evilness and is goes downhill from there. Even the gore takes a dive at the end, when Sam Neill's close ups reveal a very shoddy make up job and eyes that were previously gouged out (and albeit scary 3D pits) come back and add to the camp. If Hollywood is going to do camp, it should use a camp budget and it will have a camp feel- others on my Money In / Junk Out list include: Waterworld (Mad Max on high budget low return), Titanic (you don't need 200 mill to do a love story), Godzilla (was there a story?), Armageddon / Deep Impact (the bane of capitalism is to have two studio pay big bucks to make the same movie at the same time and still not get one iota of inventiveness ) Money In / Junk Out 1999 Oceanic Multimedia"
1,Pathetic,"Stupid piece of sci-fantasy drivel in which a bunch of perfectly likable, competent people get bloodily killed by what turns out to be a rubbery man who appears to have been involved in an explosion in a razorblade factory.I had wished that I could've given it no stars, but then I realised that hardworking actors and techies want to be able to have pension plans and be able to pay their kids' college fees."
1,DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! IT IS A DISASTER!,THIS FILM ISN'T WORTHY ON A HALF OF A STAR I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE THIS WEBPAGE FORCED ME TO.DON'T BE FOOLED INTO SEEING THIS MOVIE IT'S THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE! DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE NAMES SAM NEILL AND LAURENCE FISHBURNE! THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE! FORGET ABOUT THIS MOVIE AND SEE THE MATRIX AND YOU WILL BE ASTOUNDED BY LAURENCE FISHBURNE'S PREFORMANCE! IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GREAT SAM NEILL MOVIE SEE MERLIN!
2,Gruesome and upsetting,"A research vessel presumed lost for several years reappears, and a small crew of rescuers, along with the vessel's designer, are dispatched to investigate. Sci-fi setting but a horror plot, by the end of which it becomes very gory, including a few very disturbing images. If that's your thing, go for it, you might enjoy it, even though the story development doesn't make a lot of sense. I found it to be disturbing, not in a good way, and I regretted getting it. Video quality on the Blu-ray is very good, a noticeable step up from standard def."
5,Release Year: 1905,Wow. Great flick. Did not realize that they made colorized talkies back that far. 1905 is not even a good typo.
3,"decent, but confusing and often ridiculous","EVENT HORIZON tries to make itself seem like a sci-fi film but only comes across as a thinly disguised horror flick. The basic story is great, but the script is lacking in quality. Many questions are left unanswered and viewers may be shocked and/or confused by some of the events that take place. Would have been better had they not gone for so much of a horror take and had gone for a real sci-fi 2001/2010 type of story. But, it does leave you with an adrenaline rush when it's all over."
5,Extremely disappointed...this movie needs to be released as a true director's cut!,"After waiting all these years in the hopes that a director's cut of this movie would come out, this is what I get. This is one of my all time favorite horror movies and I would LOVE to see the movie in it's entirety, or with at least some of the deleted scenes intact in the movie...not separately on another disc. *sigh* I guess I'll still hold out a glimmer of hope that an actual director's cut will be released someday."
2,"Very, VERY scary!","When I rented this movie a few years ago, I *thought* I was getting a good sci-fi adventure. What I got was sci-fi horror (and I am *not* a horror fan by any stretch of the imagination)! I didn't sleep much that night...."
3,It's Ok,"I hate that Amazon bugs me for a review, then demands that I write something in addition to giving it stars. It was an ok movie. They don't flesh out a lot. Basically, weird stuff happens, and common sense falls out the window, like in every horror movie. It was ok. I rented it for a day, and don't feel like I wasted my money."
3,notes on quality,"Quick points: (1) the Blu-ray version does NOT have DTS, unfortunately, but a Dolby HD track. (2) The image quality is excellent, sharp and well-lit (given the milieu). This is a stunning improvement over the regular DVD which is non-anamorphic widescreen (and an excellent demo disc if someone wants to know why anamorphic is necessary), and one of the worst-looking DVDs ever struck from a quality movie. And here's a big yousuck for all the executives at Fox (in particular) who stopped putting anamorphic (or 16:9) on their DVD releases, opting instead for ""widescreen"", an ambiguous term that confuses watchable and non-watchable DVDs.Of course, a clearer copy doesn't make the film any more plausible; I can't watch it without imagining the pitch, ""first half Alien, second half Hellraiser"". 5 stars for the imaginative SF, and 1 for the Hellraiser outtakes."
2,Cure for Insomnia,"I carefully avoided all the gossip about this film so that when I went to see it at the cinema I would be watching it untainted. What I saw was a dull, predictable film with little to comment it. Some of the scenes were good but the whole thing was boring. A few months later when I had the chance to rent it I watched it twice more to see if perhaps I had missed something, but no - it was still boring.I have heard rumours that nearly half an hour of footage was cut from the film and I expected the DVD to feature this extra footage, just to see if this changed the feel of the movie. No such luck. Until then, this must rank alongside films such as the Critters series and Titan Find as plain dull."
3,Distrubing Movie!,"This movie gave me nightmares. I know that sounds silly, but it really is true. That should tell you all you need to know about this movie. It is meant to be scary as hell, and it is. I can't really say that it is good as a Sci-Fi movie, but if you put it in the horror section, it really leads the pack. The movie is beautiful and really well done. Casting is perfect, and the story is engaging and well written. The way that the ship is posessed and drives people to do horrible things to themselves and each other is really the key to the horror component of the movie. The science part is good background, but is not too overpowering. This really is just a horror movie that takes place on a spaceship, but when the end is near, you will find yourself really hoping that the characters can get the hell off of that ship!"
5,IT WAS AN ASSET FOR THE PEOPLES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT GOD BROUGHT THE EAGLES NEST DOWN FROM THE STARS! OBADIAH 1,IT SHOWS THE SPACE PROGRAMS AND THE EAGLES NEST IN THE STARS WAS NOT OF GOD AND CHRIST. I LOVED THIS DOCUMENTARY OF OBADIAH 1:1-4 AND AMOS CHAPTER 9:1-6GOD BROUGHT IT ALL DOWN AND DESTROYED IT. THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST US.
2,Not My KInd of Sci-Fi,"Alternate realities aside, I don't consider vampires and horror stories the same thing as science fiction. This movie has a space ship that was lost but came back and it now has ""Evil"" in it. It's a horror story that takes place on a space ship."
3,Good scary horror sci f i movie in that order.,"Although at first the characters in the crew may turn you off, you realize of course that they're all just going to be meat for the 'whatever it is'. It combines good horror and fright elements into a nice scifi package. I liked it. The effects were quite good as well."
4,Creepy....,Few sci-fi/horror movies from the 90s have the ability to be creepy. Even fewer horror movies have minorities as lead protagonists. This movie just works; FTW.
4,Scared the Bejezus Outta Me...,"Whoa! Holy moley! This is a frightening one. I'm not usually impressed with horror movies, and even less frightened by them, but ""Event Horizon"" breaks the mold.This film gave me nightmares for quite a while. The imagery and themes are very disturbing. I really never gave the concept of ""Hell"" much thought, but now I see it as a place to be avoided at all costs.But seriously, I really was blown away by this movie. Call it ""The Shining"" in space, but even more frightening. It has the perfect combination of horror, suspense, special effects, and cast. The horror elements are successful on the obvious AND subtle levels (psychologically) and THAT is what makes this movie kick.Only complaint: We needed a bit more of an explanation at the end to satisfy the huge build-up. I don't know. Watch it with someone else, though."
3,Disappointing but effective,"As has been noted here and elsewhere, there is not much new going on in ""Event Horizon"". Still, unoriginality is not the greatest sin a movie can make. In my opinion dullness would be a greater crime. ""Event Horizon"" drew me in from the beginning and created a sense of suspense that did not dissipate despite various flaws in the script and direction. These flaws include potentially interesting characters with not enough meat on their bones, and a typical ""explosive"" Hollywood climax.""Event Horizon"" is beautiful to look at - the sets and effects are wonderfully realized, creating a sense of gothic foreboding - and the cast, working within the previously mentioned restraints of the script, are solid. There is some extreme gore in the film (most of it shown in rapid, nearly subliminal, shots)but I did not find it gratuitous despite its extremity.""Event Horizon"" is a flawed (I still feel cheated by the trite resolution)but none the less effective science fiction/horror film."
4,The Shining Meets Alien.,"Well well well. One of the better science fiction/horror movies. I'm impressed -understatement-. Excellent cast; drop dead special effects, and, more importantly, a storyline which has the uncanny ability to suck the viewer into its intensely horrific world. Not a film for the faint hearted, Event Horizon crosses an advanced Alien look with Kubric's horror masterpiece The Shining to stupendous effect. This is a genuinly distrubing film which, though heavy on gory special effects will scare hell out of you when you watch it. One of the very few genuinly fightening films around."
4,Mind-Boggling Horror,"This is an excellent science fiction horror flick. A party of specialist returns to the lost spacecraft that can travel through the use of black holes/worm holes, hence the name ""Event Horizon"". Oddly, the bad guy is not the ship, nor is it Sam Neill; the being to detest in this movie is the universally foreign inhabitant of the ""Event Horizon"""
2,To many effects and not enough plot,This movie started off okay but then it just got stupid and then eventually got to the point where I almost turned it off. The gore in it was far more the was needed. I mean there where guys puking up their guts and getting eaten by what looked like magits. The only reason I give this movie 2 stars instead of one is because the effects were pretty good at the begining. If any of you have seen the movie Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer and thought those were gorey enough DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE.
3,"Stunning F/X, hokey story!","My reason for giving this movie a lower rating is a simple matter of personal preference, and others may completely disagree with me. I wanted this movie to be pure science. The unknown can be horrifying enough. However, the plot takes us into this ""hell"" were evil lurks, bringing up deep theological questions. I've never cared for the blending of sci-fi and theology. In my eyes, that's what brings this movie down."
4,Scary stuff on the horizon,"Sam Neill (Dr. Weir) and Lawrence Fishburne (Captain Miller) are sent into deep space near neptune when the space ship Event Horizon mysteriously re-appears after vanishing for seven years. What the crew find is that the Event Horizon harbours a terrible secret of unimaginable terror and soon the crew are battling to stay alive. Event Horizon is like a modern day Alien, scary as hell combined with great sci-fi effects. The film is well casted with Fishburne and Neill both pulling off good convincing performances. I think the thing i liked most about the film was the originality of the plot and the fact that it was really quite scary. In this day and age its difficult to find a decent scary movie but this one fits the bill and the sci-fi look apon the future helps to extend this fear. If your looking for a great sci-fi horror look no further than Even Horizon."
3,sci-fi Amityville,"This movie is like, the sci-fi version of the movie The Amityville Horror, & its ok, m'kay"
3,Interesting concept poorly developed,"I enjoyed the idea of the film but wish the director/screenwriters had developed the spiritual side of the film, offering some means of combatting the evil with good, perhaps even with Christianity. Instead, I felt the lack of true combat was a letdown. Instead, the characters use what technical means were available to flee from evil rather than confront it and win. Entertaining special effects, decent acting, and a somewhat confused storyline add up to a good midnight flick but not a great film. Still, worthwhile viewing and deserved a wider audience than it received."
4,"Very scary...""The Shining"" in space...","I will start off by saying that this is the only horror movie I have ever seen (including Blair Witch) which has resulted in recurring nightmares for me. THAT's what you want from a great horror movie! I thought it was great!It is a little too gory, but it is the psychological aspects that cause the true terror. The special effects are also top-notch.The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that it is a bit too gory and I would have liked the ending to be a bit lest ambiguous."
2,Good story overidden by needless gore,"There's nothing wrong with taking the concepts from ""Alien"" and building on them in a different direction, after all if we really liked ""Alien"" we'd welcome more stuff like it, right? This movie had the potential to do that... but instead chose the low road of excessive blood and gore. The idea of coming up with a way to defeat the laws of physics and where it might get you is intriguing- but people being dissected alive and blowing up from a bad case of the bends (decompression) is overdone and boring... rent but don't buy this one."
2,A good evening ruiner.,"I saw this film a year ago, and I STILL have trouble sleeping at night. This is the bleakest, darkest, most terrifying film I have ever seen. The Paramount logo at the beginning is basically the only positive moment in the movie. I still can't get past some of the images in the film, and I can't believe they didn't make additional edits to get an R rating. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed movies like ALIEN, Hellraiser and the Shining. But this film really hits you like a mental bullet to your psyche. After about the first hour, it stops becoming entertainment. Good cast, good concept, but a lack of emotional balance (i.e. little humor, too much gore) make the execution not so good. On the other hand, good soundtrack by Michael Kamen and Orbital, as well as cinematography by Adrian Biddle (who worked on ALIENS). Watch this moving on a hot summer day, then go sit in wide open field and tell yourself everything's going to be allright!"
1,two hours of my life that i want back,"most movies this awful are at least funny for that reason. event horizon? not even once.""come to papa bear""? WTF?i swore i'd never see another lawrence fishburne movie [sam neill's not credible enough an actor to hold accountable for anything; at least fishburne could have afforded to turn down the part]; then he did Matrix."
3,Liberate Tutame (save yourself),"Well, I can see from the other reviews that a lot of people loved this move, and many didn't. I fall in between. I'll admit that I was expecting this to be more of a sci-fi flick, and not so much a horror film. This movie leans more towards horror, which just doesn't do much for me. I can't fault the cast or special effects for me not being thrilled by the movie. It's just a genre I don't enjoy...If you're a fan or horror this film will probably suit you just fine."
5,Spectacular,"This movie is a horror masterpiece. The Hell scenes are legendary, and any gorehound should watch them frame by frame in order to enjoy them. Sam Neil's performance as Doctor Weir is spectacular.Anyone who likes horror or science fiction should buy this movie."
1,If two hours of entrails is really your cup of tea...,"....then by all means buy this movie. I think a trip to an abbatoir would be cheaper and more effective, though. What started out with an intriguing, suspenseful premise degenerated into nothing but eye-gouging and gore. I felt really cheated by the cop-out explanation: the ship had been to hell. And, I'm afraid that with that sentence I've spoiled the entire of what constitutes a plot in this movie. I wanted suspense. I wanted people going crazy in the vacuum of space, with who-knows-what hiding just around the corner. Instead, I got screaming and splatter. Sure, I was horrified, so I guess in that sense it succeeded, but really if I'm going to be holding in vomit, I at least want a plot, something that's going to make me think or engage me with some realistic characters."
1,Who's afraid of the big black hole?,"The Flying Dutchman flies again. What the Ancient Mariner forgot to tell us. Monty Python crew the Ship of Hell. What happened in this movie? Who can tell? Suddenly they were in their space suits, and suddenly they weren't. Suddenly they were ice lollies, suddenly they defroze. The geography of this ship was not easy to get a fix on. The black hole making machine was quite something. Well, now we know that hell is chaos, a place where nothing makes sense. I wasn't frightened, but I could tell that there was something funny going on. Perhaps that's why half the customer reviews are so hilarious. It's difficult not to give this flick five stars."
1,I expected way more when I saw that Sam Neil and Lawrence Fishborne were in this,I bought this because it was recommended and it has two actors I really like. Big mistake. I thought this movie was cheesy and even dumb in parts. I like science fiction but this is just a slasher movie set in space.
2,Same Story,"A poor story with a lot of physics and astronomical mistakes, the usual rescue mission of a previous lost spaceship that headed for an incredible assignment to a black hole and ended in a very terrestrial looking situation."
1,In a word... PATHETIC,"Event Horizon is what happens when people with little or no writing/directing talent attempt to write/direct a cinematic replica of a truly great film, in this case the original Alien. Watching this drek, this sad fact quickly becomes painfully obvious. From the non-sensical plot to the atrocious dialogue to the strained special effects to the obligatory crew member rendered comatose by some unseen outer space force, Event Horizon is as close to unwatchable as any film you're likely to encounter in your life. And no, I'm not exaggerating."
3,"Fun watch, Sam Neil salvaged the film","liked the concept that this film introduced, and I enjoyed the mix of science fiction horror. However, the film is flawed (Not surprising since it's directed by Paul Anderson of Alien Vs Predator) The only charachter that is very compelling is Dr. Weir played by Sam Neil (Jurassic Park) Who eventually loses his mind.The rest of the charachters were dull and not interesting.There are plot holes that are never explained (Justin falling into ""the darkness"" with no explanation from then on)and there is an obvious reference to The Shining. Still, despite the lack of plot, Sam Neil manages to salvage the film and it was truly suspenseful. I reccomend it at least once....but it's safe to say that Paul Anderson is the WORST director ever."
4,Good horror/space movie,"No spoilers in this review. This movie has it all, good acting, good effects, and gore. If you love horror buy this. Its not the end all be all of horror movies but it will kill two hours."
4,I Enjoyed It,"Terrific premise, good plot development, and excellent acting performances all around.Some may find the level of gore extreme, but I think that was more the case back when the movie came out and Mortal Kombat amounts of blood was still controversial. Today I doubt any adults will have a problem with this film in particular over any other horror movie.I have never been able to say I *enjoyed* a horror movie before. But this one, I did. It could be that I've gotten all the shock I ever will from murder porn, 2 girls one cup, pain olympics, and the slew of horror movies like Saw that are out there today that give you f****d up s*** just for the sake of itself, but this was an enjoyable amount of suspense and fright."
4,Worth the double dipping,"I consider this the best sci-fi horror since Aliens. Upgraded to the blu-ray from my non-anamorphic dvd yesterday. Totally worth it. I've seen it several times over the years and its just as spooky after all these years. The special effects, especially towards the end, really shows the age and perhaps the budget, but the script, sets, design and performances are still top notch.On the downside...they could have taken a little more effort by redesigning the blu-ray menus; and the behind the scenes are just too uninspired."
1,Vacuum cleaners aren't the only things that suck!,"I love movies. I'm patient, with them. The most thrilling and wonderful part of this movie was when it blacked out and said ""THE END"". The movie SUCKED! IT WAS SO LAME. Boring, and was more of a comedy than horror. Given, it was a tad disturbing, but it was predictable. AND, may i add the ending (last 10 seconds) were way too confusing. Will it happen again, or is it over? If God forbid, there was a sequel, it will come out along with Karate Kid 17. The movie was boring as the Hell they show you."
4,I Loved the Story Line,"An excellant movie that truly gives scares. The story line of a ship that was lost and then come back seven years later only to be haunted by the crew aboard her was amazing. Who ever thought of that was a genious. I love Horror movies, not these slasher movies like Scream 2 (Scream was actually good)and I know What You Did Last Summer, but the ones that work on a pshycological level. Eg: The Changling, Poltergeist, The Exorcist, Black Christmas, The Omen and this one plus many more. The Special effects are great and they got top notch actors but still some scenes seem to faulter. There was alot of blood and that didn't bother me but bothered others they maybe should backed off a little on the gore. When it came time for the scares this one delivered. There are only two movies that I can't watch by myself and they are The Exorcist and Event Horizon. I know that Event Horizon isn't the scariest but... If your in the mood for a Horror you can't go wrong with this movie."
2,"""Scarier than Seven?"" Someone was pulling my leg.","Even taking into account the big-screen-to-small-screen thing, I can't see why this was being bandied about as being ""more scary than Se7en."" Good acting, some awesome sets, and a boatload of special effects, but it still seems like a more malevolent Farscape without the hand of the House of Henson involved. And can someone please stop Michael Kamen from attempting to score films? Sheesh. Even In the Mouth of Madness was a better Sam Neill vehicle than this, and one wonders what Fishburne was thinking when he took the role."
1,Does not deserve to be called sci-fi,It started out with a good premise but then it went downhill from there. The ending is simply too grotesque to even dignify with a description.
2,"Wham, Bang","Starts Ok but then degenerates to shock scene treatment that does not stimulate the mind. It's like a cheap copy ofSolaris (George Clooney, Viola Davis et al) idea."
4,"Great film, especially for this genre.......","The greatest thing about this film, is the real possibility this technology may actually be developed someday, hopefully with better consequences. The overall message of this movie is the closer one plays being God, the more tragic the possible outcomes....all the while playing on deep seeded Judeo-Christian fears, etc....A must see, and future classic......IMO."
2,Event Horizon...a critical overview,"Event Horizon has all the components to make a great film.stunning cast, amazing special EFX, Directing is.....well, its good from the start.and thats where it ends.you have a good watch until the last part of the movie.that part thats supposed to tie up all the loose ends...and that is when you want your money back.it just doesn't have the close.I will not disclose any spoilers, but the end has a look that seems to be as if, they had a new writer for the last 20-30 minutes of the movie,or maybe a new director,who took over,and didnt have a good idea what went on before.it would be worth waiting until you can pickup this in the bargain bin.at 19.99,its not there yet."
4,Great freaky movie!,"I hadnt seen this movie in years, got an itch to watch it, and none of the stores in my area had it, so off to Amazon!Great deal here folks, 2 disc, $10! If ya remember this movie and like it, buy it... if you've never seen it and enjoy sci-fi movies, action movies, or horror movies, then get it! Very creepy/scary/great!"
3,BLU RAY Review,Love the movie but no wow effects on the video quality. Id say that the upconversion on the standard dvd would be of same detail that of this blu ray edition.
1,the worst film ever made,"I think that ""Event Horizon"" could very well be the worst movie ever to be made in the history of film. I'd give it zero starts if possible. Now, I certainly haven't seen every movie ever made, but of the films I have seen, this is easily the movie that I hate the most. It starts off promisingly, and then just rapidly takes a nosedive into the sewage that it came from. I think the reason it is so bad is because it has the potential to be good. Scenes are set up tensely, and then just end up ......... Kathleen Quinlan's part with that dude in that air tent thing? It starts to get creepy, and then it ...... The ending? ....... An affront to movie watchers everywhere. I try to be forgiving, but this one sins far too much."
2,Super Massive Dissapointment,"I am giving this two stars because it started out very good, but around midway through the movie swiftly hurtled off the tracks and tumbled to a grinding, fore-head slapping halt. I'll keep this short. I love sci-fi. So that is not why I didn't like it. It started out with an interesting premise, but little by little you can see that the screen writer had no idea where he was going. I got the feeling that they were throwing in ""scary parts"" without connecting them in any viable way to any sort of plot. Just tacked on. The acting is decent so that's not the problem. It's mainly just that the story starts out good but then doesn't follow through. I didn't even care about the gore. It didn't scare me at all. Go watch ALIEN. Much better and more consistent throughout."
1,horrible,some of these reviewers must be completely stoned. this movie really sucks. i often refer to it as the worst movie ever made. and i even saw something amusing in 'blood beach'. i've recently suggested that this movie receive a biohazard rating from the barbaras of theyrecoming.com - i'm still waiting for their judgement.please do yourself a favor and take your life rather than watching this movie.
2,Grab-bag of 'supernatural' horrors in space,"EVENT HORIZON(USA/UK - 1997)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTSIn 2047, an interstellar rescue team boards a spacecraft in orbit around Neptune which has been missing since disappearing through a black hole, and they're stalked by an alien presence which uses their worst fears against them.Paul Anderson's overblown space shocker has a great cast (including Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson and Kathleen Quinlan) and some eye-popping space vistas, but the storyline doesn't amount to very much, and the set-pieces are variable in quality and effectiveness. Fantastic visual effects, gruesome HELLRAISER-style imagery in places. Well made, and certainly watchable, but equally missable."
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","One of the worst Sci Fi movies ever made. How anyone could stuff something up this badly when they have such a decent cast and budget is beyond me. It starts well and up until about the halfway point is still relatively engaging, but after that it all falls in a screaming heap. I'm not sure what happened, perhaps they ran out of time or the original writer quit and they had to finish it quickly or something. Whatever the reason it changes for being a competent film with an intriguing if generic storyline and decent sets into a lame gorefest that is as predictable as most from that overpopulated genre. Even the gore is badly done, so if your into that then you'll be disappointed as well. I sadly went to see this at the cinema when it was first released and nearly walked out but thought that surely something would happen to tie it all together, alas I was wrong. Don't waste 90 mins of your life on this turkey."
1,One of the 90's worst,"The only reason I give it one star is for the great special effects. The movie itself is awful. Does someone have to explode every time a movie takes place in outer space? It's just gore to have gore. The story makes no sense, the characters are cardboard, and sadly, Sam Neill's character makes no sense. Paul Anderson may have done wonders with the special effects of Mortal Kombat, but he has no clue on what a story is. Put it this way, he followed this debacle up with Soldier... Stay away from Event Horizon -- it's the kind of piece that ruins a genre."
1,"Is it hot in here, or is this movie just dumb?","If you liked ""She-Devil"". If you liked ""Wing Commander"". You'll LOVE ""Event Horizon"". I, on the other hand, hated both of those movies.This movie is an hour and a half long identity crisis. Is it a sci-fi movie? Is it a horror movie? Or is it a poorly executed, twisted combination of both?The only thing horrific about this movie is the premise - Let's put the guy from ""Bicentennial Man"", Cowboy Curtis from ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"", and the school teacher that ran over the creepy kid on the bike from, ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"", on a space ship careening through the solar system. What happens next is anyone's guess.Did the spaceship take a wrong turn and end up in Hell? Or is the spaceship actually Hell, controlled by a crew of the Devil's ambassadors? Is Laurence Fishburne hurting for cash? These are just a few questions that ""Event Horizon"" does a good job of not answering.This movie is pure evil."
1,A Bloody Mess,"I do not get grossed out easily, but I concur with one review I read about this movie, calling it ""a bloody mess."" For a while after we saw this movie, we called it ""Eyeless Sockets"" because of its strange propensity toward showing people with their eyes gouged out, just walking around, acting as if nothing had happened. To me, the movie Sphere was everything I hoped this movie would be, and wasn't. If you want something sci-fi, suspenseful, and mysterious, see Sphere instead.Event Horizon has great special effects, but the premise is bad, the story is bad, and the whole film is just kind of nauseating, disturbing, and somehow, tedious at the end."
3,event horizon,"this movie had a great idea and did a good job about fifty percent of the movie but there to much gore and special gore scenes , i mean like its about science and they make it gore for dumb asses."
4,Not as bad as I thought it would be,"I guess I am getting old. I used to love movies with gore! I would go see anything that was scary. Now days, I avoid them. But, I was brave, and I picked up Event Horizon. I am a big Sci-Fi fan. Even Horizon pulled me in. I found the story to be very interesting and the gore didn't bothe me as much as the idea that this ship might have gone to hell and back. It was scary and I enjoyed it. The ending scenes were a bit of a let down, kind of like Sphere, but I enjoyed the final scene. Not as bad as some people say, but then again, I loved LOST IN SPACE and I felt Batman and Robin wasn't that bad. Go figure!"
4,"Hey, if it scared ME, then it has to be good!!!!!","I saw Event Horizon in the theater, and it scared the s**t out of me. I don't scare very easily; I saw Alien when I was in 6th grade and the only thing that upset me was my fear that the alien would eat the cat. I was a little annoyed at the open-endedness of the plot, but the more times I watched it, the more I appreciated it. It leaves much room for speculation about where exactly the ship went, or how it killed the crew, of where that guy who intones the infamous words, ""Liberate tuteme ex inferis,"" came from (actually how he got onto the ship), and I could go on! I loved the gore, I wish it had been a bit more explicit so I could see and understand better, but what the hell? It was a great movie!"
4,"Superb Cast, Good Storyline loses it somewhere","One of reasons I was drawn to this movie was because Laurence Fishburne was in it. The cast led by Fishburne and the other seasoned actor Sam Neil guides carries this film a couple of notches above all the teen based horror movie. The concept of haunted ship works for th most part. Sam Neil playing the troubled scientist who slowly becomes demented with Fishburne playing the charasmatic and commanding Captain is just riveting. The supporting cast for the most part is equally good. There are hardly any ghouls or ghosts seen here but the tension builds itself solidly from the first time you see the Event Horizon hovering in between the clouds. The dialogue is not too corny either. The ship itself is the epitome of fear, gourgeously designed knee deep in a gothic nightmare and dark future. The SFX are brilliant. This movie is good horror fest, destined to be a cult movie if it is'nt already."
1,"It's really, really bad.","This film is one of the most idiotic attempts at sci-fi that I've ever endured. Frankly, if I wasn't basically a rather squeamish person, I'd have gnawed off my own leg, right there in the middle of the cinema. I now understand why the proprietors liberally scattered beartraps throughout the gallery.Why don't I like it?It's pretentious, factually incorrect (you don't orbit a world *inside* its atmosphere), and ultimately very predictable. It also dredges up one of the oldest saws in the bad sci-fi toolchest, to wit ""Mess not with things ye do not understand, lest ye limbs turneth blue and falleth to the ground"". If everyone thought like this, the world would contain nothing but superstitious troglodytes sacrificing sundry animals and other troglodytes in an ongoing attempt to appease various rocks.This is a movie for lop-sided mouth-breathers."
3,Event Horizon,Neat concept but it never quite engages the viewer. I think a lot of the back story wound up on the cutting room floor. There isn't enough there to make you care about the characters.
4,"Well, THIS certainly scared the **** out of me.","After watching this several times back in the late 90's, I've been scared ****less for many days. I was still a kid back then. Now, in 2008, I go back to it, and although I've gotten used to the fright scenes, it still gives me the frights. I surprisingly didn't find ""Exorcist"" scary, but this one took me to a darkest wonderland I ever saw.Sam Neill, Lawrence Fishburne, and the supporting cast give very good performances, and the special effects look only a tad unrealistic. The silence (and the ""jumpy"" music) that make up the creepiest scenes are quite effective. The storyline (and the astronomy that's central to the plot) might be a bit confusing to some viewers.Overall, it's one hell of a horror/sci-fi flick."
2,Not So Hot,"It's an ok card program if you're not really serious about making nice cards. Might be good for teachers who don't mind a lot of cartoony clip art. Photos and other art work are pretty spare and lacking. If you want to be able to make really nice, attractive cards, I don't recommend this program."
1,This is the Worst Ever!!!!,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. In about 1/4 of the shots you get wonderful views of the boom mic. Some shots are very shakey too, but just depends on whether that kind of stuff bothers you."
2,Vampire Flick,Lame vampire flick about a woman who has recurring dreams of her lover 100 years ago. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Disappointed. This movie really sucks.,"I love Subspeices and I thought this would be reminiscent of it since D.D. is in it. I was wrong. It is like something you could make up in your head and say, na, that would suck. You could make a better one on your camcorder."
3,It has a nice twist,"I didn't go with any expectations while watching this movie and it surprised me. Miss Duff stars and produced this movie and I think she did a good job. Miss Duff was once a full moon actress and she starred in the subspecies movies. But, this movie was one of her ideas and I think it was interesting. While yes, it wasn't the greatest, it still was good to watch..."
3,Good idea bad budgeting,"I thought this movie had a great idea behind it and everyone involved tried their best in what they were given in the budget. However, because of the budget of this movie it cost the director from casting and hiring decent filmmakers to make this movie into a good film."
5,Essential snapshots of every nation in the world,"If you need quick, hard, reliable, up-to-date data on any nation in the world then this is the resource for you. You get political, historical, economic, sociological, religious, racial, military, educational, and geographic information in a concise, well-organised format. Even the maps are uncluttered and contain only the priciple cities and geographic features. You can quickly flip between entries for fast comparisons.This publication has been updated yearly and made available to the public since 1975. The sections on internal political groups, conflicts with other states, internal conflicts, drug production and consumption, reported AIDS cases, and internal distribution of income are especially useful and usually resonably current.The entry on the United States itself is an especially candid thumbnail on how the country views itself at any given point of time."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I have seen mixed reviews of this film with a lot more leaning toward negative than positive so I wasn't expecting much. I think that mindset helped me really enjoy this film. This is one of those films that may very well garner a cult following especially if it enters into a heavy cable rotation. It can be a bit confusing at times and the effects do betray the budget limitations here and there but all in all I really did enjoy the movie. Pop in this one and the viking/spaceman/alien monster flick Outlander for some good quality, low budget, sci-fi escapist fun."
2,"No Sparkle, A Mere Retirement Sweetener","Kotler has always been a very lucid author on issues pertaining to marketing. With marketing moving into a new era, namely relationship, one-to-one he has become somewhat stale. This book contains rehashed old issues, and is merely a compilation of past theories. I get the distinct feeling this book was written to capitalise on his name, and to feather his nest before retirement. His earlier books are better."
3,"Good reminder material, but hardly revolutionary","This is some good reminder material, but that is about it. He hardly mentions measuring the ROI of many of his ""solutions"", leading one to assume that adding an Intranet, Extranet, and CRM system are vital at all costs. Clearly, that is not the case.My big problem with this and many other marketing books is that there is such a HUGE difference between Industrial (B2B) and Consumer (B2C) marketing that Phil should have written two books like this one - one for each. It would have been much more useful to most of the reviewers, I am sure.I have used the consulting firm he credits in his acknowledgements (Hamilton Consultants) and find them very, very good.Overall, this is a quick read, a nice reminder of things we still forget to do, but hardly an earth shattering best seller. I agree with others that I expected a little more from Phil Kotler."
2,A Very Commonsensical Book From A So Called Guru,"Write new Stuff, Mr. Kotler!There is a tendency for him to reharsh old materials and package them as new ones to sell.Buyers and readers be aware!Nothing new or exciting about the book. It is too bad for Kotler to model after the writing and book presentation styles of Al Ries and Jack Trout, authors of Positioning and the Immutable Laws of Marketing (or Branding) series.While the book is easy to read and digest, it lacks both depth and substance.As an Academic Scholar, Kotler should impress readers with new ideas on his own, not just doing books summaries or trends reports."
3,this book is applied to only big corporations,"Easy to read. No big adjectives. Flow is smooth. This is how this book is laid out.However, all examples are about Fortune 500 big corporations. Small- or medium-sized corporations can not act on this book. Only the big corporations can carry out an in-depth interview, a focus group, and etc.The mentioning in this book is not practical for all of us."
4,MEZUNLARA PAZARLAMA HATIRLATMASI,"ArkadaslarKitabin ingilizcesi Super lise okuyan birinin anliyacagi saflikta, kitabi sikilmadan 1 gunde bitire bilirisiniz. Kitapta soylenen yeni hic bir sey yok. Bildiginiz ama unuttugunuz pazarlama terimlerini hatirlamaniza yardimci olur. Gercek yasam vakalari ile sizi biraz sasirta bilir ama daha fazlasini beklemeyin.Kotler abimiz bir anlamda not defterini almis basmis okadar. Easy and Simple.Iyi calismalar."
4,2 Years now,"TV is good. Have had mine for 2 years now. One problem as with all these types of TV's, I would put on gray bars to put it to 4:3 size when watching regular TV and the bars started burning into the screen. You must always view in widescreen to avoid this, also, have the service plan if you can and have someone come out a align the projections every year. Makes a difference. Picture is great as a whole and DVD movies are really nice via componet video with progressive scan. Getting a deal on it, then I would grab it."
1,too old,"I agree 100% with the reviewer that rated this product badly, in my case the perfume is way too old as well. It was poor judgement on my part since I remember the date was advertised, I ordered it anyway since this particular perfume isn't made anymore for women, it is either for men or Eau de Adrien for women. When I used it 8 years ago, it was a heavenly fragrance, everybody asked me: What are you wearing? I love it!. This old bottle has lost all the citrus fresh tones, because of old age I am pretty sure, and all that is left are the heavy base notes, very spicy and kind of rancid. I am thinking about using it as closet deodorizer, since hurts me to through it away."
1,2005 edition is misleading-not updated since 2000!!!,"Although this is the 2005 edition, the info for many countries has not been updated since 2000. In fact, there is no information at all included on any coin issued after 2000 for many countries. The information that is included is incomplete, especially for smaller countries. But there are huge omissions(many items missing) for the even the most populated countries in the world, especially China (PRC). I felt cheated as I expected this to be a professional, complete reference work. Instead it was sloppy, disorganized and incomplete."
1,No price changes....,"Here we go again...You might think that with the rise in the price of metals this year we would expect to see overall price re-evaluations in this latest edition of World Coins (The answer is NO, Krause Publishing figures that a re-designed cover qualifies as a 'new' addition). Save yourself some coin and purchase a used 32nd edition, which is basically identical except that with the 2006 ed. you also get coin listings of 2001 and up! You will now have to purchase another catalog for 'updated' 2001 and up coin pricing...Lazy and a rip."
5,I recommend you the last edition of World Coins,"An excellent book as allways, recommended for people who collect, and/or sells/buy World Coins, A lot of improved images and list of prices. I would say this book is the STATE OF THE ART in World Coins catalog.Of course a book you MUST HAVE!!!For the ones that want to have the details of World coins from 2001 to nowadays will need to wait a few weeks before the new catalog will be available. I have pre-ordered them to be sure of get them as far as they are release to the market.Good look and enjoy collecting.Guillermo Jose Silva Magno, Buenos Aires, Argentina"
1,"If i can give less than 1 star, I would","Please check ur database before sending me this email. The purchase was not completed!!The shipping was terrible, even when i chose the express shipping. DHL fail to get the correct address, and despite me calling up to assure them that is the right address, they choose not to deliver to my building.BAD and i will never purchase the product from Amazon."
4,World Coin Values,"Book is fine though large(thick), with rathar thin paper pages. Some coins don't show the value of coins in different grades ba fairly good guide as to the value. Also since there are so many countries listed ""tabs"" would help a lot,even if a set of blank tabs came with the book."
5,Excellent guide to coins,Very good book for reference. Has all the coins in it with actual sizes of the coins for easy reference.
2,Lot's of information in Black&White,"Like all the books in the series, lot's of information in black and white pictures, in this case also low quality paper.I would divide this book to two different books.Publisher should offer hardback book with full coloured pictures."
4,Wrong book was shipped to me,"There must be some mistake in the Amazon stock regarding this book.I have ordered this book, 2006 Standard Catalog of World Coins, 1901-Present by Chester L. Krause, Clifford Mishler, Colin R., II Bruce (Editor), but instead I have received 2006 Standard Catalog of World Coins, Colin Bruce and Thomas Michael, Based on the original work of Chester L. Krause, Clifford Mishler, by kp publication.You can see the book I have received here: http://www.telesphere.com/books/worldcoins.htmlI have been treated extraordinary nice by Amazon, returning me the full cost of the book + shipping.I just hope the above mistake will be fixed and other customers will receive the right book.Thank youGabriel"
5,Great Running Shoe,"This shoe is very good for a runner with shin splints. I run 20-25 miles a weeks, and this shoe has helped my shin splints. I do not have them. It is very light, and holds up really well. Well worth the money."
5,Requien is Incredible and you cant go wrong with Herbert von KArajan,"I love this piece and Herbert von Karajan always does a good job. YOu cant go wrong buying this. Extra plus... its in surround, which I havent heard yet. Ill try to remeber to reviw it again when i do listen to the surround version"
4,"Funny, the Penguin Guide gives it a Rosette!","Not the best recording perhaps, but still a fine disc. The performance is excellent."
3,Build tough but lets look to the future,"This knife is made solid and can take a beating. This was my very first Kershaw knife and I carried it for about a year, until I replaced it with other Kershaw models. The belt clip is solid and it sits fairly deep into your pocket. The blade has some milling and drilling designs to reduce the weight but still at 4.5 oz and it's still heavy for me. It has good `jimping' and thumb stud, so you'll get good grip on holding and opening it. Because Kershaw materials and design have improved so much over the past year, I would look at other blades from them. You'll get more value for your money."
5,incandescence in the wilderness,"The artfull instrumental minimalism of this outfit is weaved together to a delightfully complex effect. The lyrics are presented like a post-modern incantation of a kind. The ringing guitars, sinister riffs and ominous drums combine with these quasi-arcane proclamations to create something unique. Something that touches our sublime undercurrents of loss, fear and wide-eyed wonder between our monuments and ruins. Something that is ardently emotional and intense in the face of our new century uncertainties. It is art for our time and it is truly remarkable."
4,hmmm.,"I heard this album after searching through someone's computer, and immeditely got hooked on track three, ""It's all the same"". It just has a nice, upbeat feeling to it. I also enjoyed ""Arkless"". One thing I can say about this band is that they play extremely tight. Unlike the music, it took a while for the singer to grow on me.... but he did. I would recommend this album to anyone. and remember, listen to it a couple times before you hate on it! peace out-"
2,90% filler,"Over 90% of this book is boring filler. So instead of wasting your time, just read the plot summary on Wikipedia. I recommend the plot summary instead of completely skipping the book, because there is one interesting idea in the book about the origin and propagation of the messages.If you want a book with lots of original ideas about a message from the stars readHis Master's Voice. Lem's book predates this one by 4 years..."
2,Could be better as a short story,"The core story - scientists on earth intercept an alien message, send a reply and get a surprising reply back from the aliens - is intriguing. However, around this story is wrapped layers and layers of needless (and repetitive) fluff. All the ""human interest"" elements just drag along, frustrating the reader and making him yearn for the plot to move forward. Even the human interest side stories are repetitive - each one involves somebody or something threatening the scientists' project, then in the final few pages, everything is resolved and the project plods along. The first message is received only halfway in the book, and lots of needless drama takes place before message contents are revealed. However, I must give credit to a very surprising ending, so try to skim over all the fluff and get to the end."
5,50 Cent & Destiny's Child a perfect match!!,"I just loooove the song Thug Love ! I heard it a couple of times on the radio and it is sooo awesome. I like the ""ah"" in the back and I like Destiny's Child a lot. I was looking for it for a long time and now I finally found it. You have to believe me when I say that this is one of the most original songs I have ever heard. The lyrics are very ""thug"" and I hope everyone else will like it as much as I do!!"
5,Old 50 Is The Best 50!,"If you want to find out what 50 sounds like as a hungry crack dealer check this out. It seems to me that rappers always fall off after they get rich which certainly is the case with 50. He is hungry with no money and was literally 3 days from becoming a star back in 2000 because he was about ready to shoot the video for Thug Love ft. Beyonce which would have skyrocketed him to stardom but was shot 9 times. It would really be interesting to see what would have happened if 50 got big in 2000 instead of 2003 The whole G-Unit as we know it may not even exist. Best Songs: As The World Turns Ft. Bun B of UGK, Your Life's on the Line, Ghetto Qu'ran, How To Rob Ft. The Madd Rapper and Gun Runner. Overall great CD Don't need to hit the skip button once!"
5,Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"50 puts noting out , but classic cop every 50 Mixtape u can get ur hands on.Fav track(Good Die Young)"

1,Rip-off,"REALLY GREAT ALBUM, REALLY GREAT SONGS BUT ITS AN OVERPRICED COPY. I PUT MY TRUST INTO AMAZON AND WHAT DID THEY GIVE ME??? A DAMN FAKE!"
1,mainly for fans of the West Wing,"The idea of a new Battlestar series was a good one. It's too bad that what we got was more West Wing than the ""reinvention"" of the genre that we were promised. Real tragedy like September 11 mixed in with robots and soap opera makes for a mish-mash that just doesn't work for me. It gets worse as the series goes. Stick with Firefly."
2,THE PACE IS VERY SLOW!!!!,"The PACE of this series is VERY SLOW. As a result, it could get boring at times and fails to hold your attention into watching the next episodes.Unless you are a Battlestar Galactica fan, I wouldn't recommend buying these DVD set."
3,Great,"Thank you very much.Only complaint i have is with the Post Office, i did not receive notification that this was available. When i asked they said that it had been there for about a week."
3,okay series,"I watched this for a few episodes and then stopped. I don't care for this series, but it has some decent performers like Olmos. The reviewers who are saying it's a substitute for C.N.N. and Fox News are extremely misguided."
2,way too much like West Wing,"I prefer Sci Fi that explores various alien cultures and worlds. Battlestar is so much like West Wing that it sacrifices any hope of such exploration. Olmos even said he'd quit if they added aliens. I like this slightly more than West Wing, but only slightly."
1,"great show, very bad hd-dvd","this series is super. However this HD-DVD is a joke. Two discs wouldn't play (already sent it back). The picture quality of the mini-series is very bad and takes me back to the early VHS-days. This needs to be remasterd! The picture quality for season 1 is better but not near reference quality for HD (but better than the dvd, I must admit)."
4,Battlestar Galactica season 1 HD,Love the show and the HD is a little better than average. But come on people the packaging is silly. I mean at least box it up.
1,Utter trash,"The people giving this box set 5 stars either reviewed it before it came out (check the review dates), are extremely naive, or are studio plants. This box set is worthless. If these reviews were supposed to be based solely on the merit of the show, then I would give this box set a solid 5 stars, but the point is to review the whole product and that's what I'm doing. The negatives far outweigh the positives and if you're smart, you'll avoid this set like the plague."
3,A very good show,"This is indeed a very good show: great production values, top-notch acting, well-written scripts. The only thing that bothers me a little bit is the following: it must be really hard to command Galactica... WHy?Simple: because Galactica is a military installation where almost EVERYBODY, from the lowest soldier or corporal, to the highest ranking officers, disobey orders at will, point guns at their superiors, argue with them in front of lower ranking personnel. all that when they simply think there is a better option to the order they received. This is amazing! What sloppy training these guys must have received from the Colonial military establishment!"
3,huh?,What's up with these 'fans'? They aren't happy that many people have noticed that the series is influenced by 9/11 and the War on Terror. They say it isn't true. Why is that? They say that people who notice the influence of real events on the series are 'sad' and 'idiots'. Why are such fans bent on hiding the social commentary of the series? I suspect it's because that's the weakest part of the series. Denying the references doesn't help. Moore says he wants references to Iraq and 9/11 in the series. The series does contain social commentary. Moore points those things out in his podcasts and articles. So now Moore is sad and an idiot? With fans like that who needs enemies?
3,Won't buy it if I know what a HD before DVD would mean to me,I got no way to play the disk unless i put down another hundred buck or two for a HD DVD player which is highly unlikely. Am looking for a way around it.
1,HD?,"The package is junk, the disk have scratches, some episodes wont play and parts look worse than VHS. Save your money until they can fix this great show!"
3,Does NOT include the miniseries!!!,I believed that the Season 1 download included the mini-series but it does not. It does not include the miniseries even though the Season 1 DVD does include the miniseries. Having to buy both separately really doesn't save you anything and you are better off just buying the DVD.
1,dont buy,The Season 1 box set INCLUDES the Mini-series. Do not select Amazon's 'Great Buy' option to get them both or you'll end up with two copies of the mini-series.There was a UK release of Season 1 without the Miniseries (also sold in North America by Best Buy only) which is why a separate mini-series only disk exists. You do not need to buy it though with the North American Season 1 Box set.Save youself and dont buy it.
2,Smorgasbord of stolen ideas that is interesting,"The character development is weak in this series. I watched it based on a recommendation from a few people and it was a real letdown after all the hype.It is an interesting blend of Blade Runner, the Japanimation Bubblegum Crisis (boomers), and nice random silly lifts off of comic books like Lobo (frakkin!). BUT it doesn't come close to being as amazing as those stories because the characters are weak and development is weak. One of the only reasons I like certain characters are their costumes not the content of their character."
5,And the winner is.. HD-DVD,That's it for me. Battlestar is coming to HD-DVD so there's no question of BlueRay vs. HD anymore.TREAT YOURSELF TO SOME GREAT STORYTELLING WITH THE BEST SHOW EVERRR!!!!
1,What is this rehashed program its nothing like Battlestar Galactica,"This show is awful and that is being kind. I tried to watch but could not get past more than a few episodes and that was forcing myself with the notion that this should get better, it cannot get worse, but sadly it does. They should have called this something else ie. Caprica, as it had only the names and a slight concept of the original Battlestar Galactica story line. If I had no idea of the original and knew nothing of that series, I could give this more than a single star maybe two for a couple of episodes but for the most part a single star would cover the whole show. I am just so surprised this show was kept on the air for more than a single season. The original story from the late 70's worked great why destroy it."
1,More like Battlestar 90210,"I will start with I AM a BIG fan of the original 1970s series.There was almost no continuity with the original. Turning Starbuck and Boomer in to Women!!!! What the Hell. If you wanted to use Female lead roles fine...but at least give them different names.The stories are nothing but lame drama very little action and almost no space action. The stores more resemble a soap opera than a sci fi show. It was like watching ""As Galactica Turns"".And once they had one of the actors fall in love with a cylon I quit watching.The sets are lame, very low budget.The cyclons do not even look like some alien race no kind of armor, fine they did not have to make them look shiny...but making them look like humans ... Huh! Bad guys should look like bad guys not some mentaly twisted version of humans.I can't believe Glen Larson could do something like this. If they were going to change this so much from the original they should of called it something else."
1,Not a good production!,"The show is great. But I don`t recommend the HD-DVD set at all. Video quality is bad, especially concerning the mini series. Also the packing is terrible, wrapped in plastic with cut corners. Doesn`t fit in nicely in my shelf at all."
1,Another scratched disk victim,"I purchased the season 1 boxset and it arrived in good condition with no obvious dammage. However, all 6 disks have concentric scratches. Just called Amazon customer support, they are going to send another copy, but I am afraid it will have the same problem, as the scratches look like a manufacturing problem, not a package or shipping problem. Amazon support says if replacement set has problem, they will refund money."
4,A brief comment,"Overall, this is a very strong first season, with great characterization, a strong story plot, and nice special effects. If anything, the state of humanity's last remnants is even more precarious and desperate than in the miniseries, and the appealing story line of the last of humankind, desperately looking for their lost homeworld, never fails to hold one's interest. The only reason for four stars is that the series gets off to a somewhat slow start, and I'd really give it four and a half stars if I could. But other than that, it's a great series and well worth your time."
5,Superb Re-imagining! Drama not just for sci-fi fans!,"I was skeptical when I heard that the Sci-Fi channel was working on a ""new"" Battlestar Galactica. I had been a fan of the original as a kid and even though that one was cheesy it still had a special place in my memory. I should not have worried. The new Battlestar takes everything that I loved about the original, removes the cheese, and makes it darker and more realistic. I love this show. This show is actually what I had hoped for with Star Trek Voyager, but of course never got. A ragtag fleet, on its own, trying to survive against a superior enemy. I love the way the mythology is developing and I know this will be a classic for years to come. The stories on the show are so well done that they are accessible for everyone, even those who do not like traditional sci-fi. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
5,"Movie quality series, edge of seat...fulid storyline","I had never seen this show until recently. Even if you are not a SyFy geek, you will love it. It's like a movie that never fails to leave you on the edge of your seat. It is visually beautiful. It shocks you when you least expect it. I never watched the original, so I'm not like so many others that compare and contrast. But if you love a good plot the production ,writing, acting...etc get a 10 out of 10 for this show at least for the first season...that is where I'm at. I have to make myself go to bed, and can't wait to get home and watch another. I appreciate the work placed into this series. I actually do not have once single bad thing to say about this show...and I'm a nasty critic."
5,Good Stuff,"Great show! Really great! You may be surprised how a low budget sci fi show can be better than the recent Star Wars movies. Yes, it really is. Even the special effects are on par with the latest Hollywood big budget movies."
5,must have,"If you have not been watching the new Battlestar Galactica, you should start at the beginning and catch up. It is a wonderfully complex tale that builds episode by episode and so should be watched sequentially to maximize enjoyment. if you have been watching, you will want to be able to see it all again! I bought it in order to introduce my brother to this wonderful world."
2,This is grown up?,"BSG has ""grown up"". The FUN and JOY of the original series has been replaced by PRETENSE and MISERY. It's like revisiting a childhood friend and discovering they've become a depressed drunk who insists they are more sophisticated. Many people will join that club, but I'd rather be a happy kid at heart. FUN and JOY are good things."
2,not that exciting or interesting,I have been trying to get into Battlestar Galactica and not having much luck. By the middle of the first season I'd grown weary of hearing about GOD GOD GOD GOD while the series crawled along at the pace of a snail. Some have compared Battlestar Galactica to Firefly. I recently learned that Sci Fi Channel was showing Firefly and gave it a try. It's good! Firefly is far better than Battlestar IMHO. I plan to buy Firefly on DVD through Amazon.
3,not Space 1999,"It's hard to keep watching Galactica without popping Space 1999 into the DVD player instead. Space 1999 was largely free of the pointless repetitive angst of twenty-something characters and it wasn't just plain dreary over and over. Battlestar is just too repetitive and limited in it's scope. Space 1999 was a far more diverse series that could be light, dark, gripping, outlandish, claustophobic, incredibly expansive, and imaginative. On Space 1999 there were endless explorations of new worlds, cultures, universes, and beings. Anything could happen. SPACE 1999 HAD IT ALL. The same can't be said of Battlestar. It's far more restricted and hits the same notes over and over. Give Space 1999 a try instead."
2,not my show,I'll likely get slammed for not liking this but I agree with those who dislike the pace of galactica. I do not agree with those that say all naysayers are bitter fans of the original. Hardly. I tried to like it and I keep an eye on it. It's fine for some. Not what I like. I'd prefer something more upbeat that moves along.I'm not 'searching for a reason' to dislike this. I know exactly why it's not for me. I also don't watch 'lost' and don't just follow the critics. I keep an eye on glactica but it doesn't hold my attention. It doesn't make me want to tune in each week.I recently caught some of sg-1 for the first time. I like it a lot. It's more my type of quality program IMHO. I'd purchase those DVDs sometime.But Helo is hot!:)
4,Starbuck is the reason this series exist,I'm so glad that Battlestar Galactica has been brave enough to castrate the ancient masculine stereotype that has plagued us all for far too long. Gone is the tough guy b.s. that went out with the 80's. It deserves to be dead and buried and Katee has killed it off. Women kicks ass harder than the boys ever can and REAL Starbuck proves it. Katee is the TRUE Starbuck and the only reason this series has lasted so far. She could kick the *** of the entire cast. They need to drop number 6 and give us more Starbuck.
1,Just revewing the commentary,"The show is fantastic, no need to re-review it. The only bother that I have with the entire season is the lack of bonus features. The podcast from Ron Moore is good and all, it is just that there is no other commentary. It his Ron sitting at home with his wife doing a pd cast. You hear her eating cereal next to him, the cats meowing, random background noises like phones ringing. Which is fine and all, but that is all that is offered. I just wish there were actor commentaries as well. Gag reels, behind the scenes stuff etc etc.I don't want to wait 10 years for an anniversary edition."
3,Not bad for a SiFi,Not a bad series. I don't like the amazon deliver of the video. But the show is good.
3,Poor product handling,"My only complaint is every box set I purchase through Amazon.com arrives with the storage box for the DVD's looking as if it had been used to play soccer with before being shrink-wrapped in the shipping container. 5-stars for price, shipping speed, 1/2-star for Amazon's handling/storage."
3,Amazing show - HORRIBLE PACKAGING,"I love BSG - what an amazing sci-fiction/drama epic. No complaints about the show, or their presentation on HD-DVD - they look wonderful.But the packaging is ABYSMAL. Cheap cardboard flaps, little rubber nubs, and 6 very scratched discs is what I found when I opened my Amazon package. Thinking it was just a fluke, I went online to see other people's experiences. Nope, the forums are ablaze with complaints of scratched discs. Good job Universal!Cutesy packaging is fine, but it needs to protect the discs first and foremost. These increasingly cheap boxsets with damaged discs are really getting old (I'm looking at you too Star Trek season 1 HD DVD....)."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL,INCREDIBLE SERIES. SEASON ONE HAS SET THE TONE. CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SEASON 2. EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.
5,Outstanding,"This series got me back into Science Fiction. I didn't really feel much from the miniseries, but starting with episode one, I was hooked. This is a wonderfully written show, with a top notch cast. This is a space opera with plots and subplots woven together to make a very rivoting story that is intelligent, but does not confuse. It is a darker more modern storytelling, so fans of the old series may be put off. I personally can't recommend this enough."
5,Compelling,"More than entertaining, this series and its characters provide the basis for true attachment."
1,Unmitigated Garbage,"This show isn't geared for serious Sci-Fi fans so much as perverts and teen boys looking to get their rocks off with all the sexual action. You get the mental image of these geeks locked in their room with the show on, and a box of kleenex at their side, while Momma screams ""dinner is ready! come on down NOW!"" as they freeze frame scenes with the femme fatale Cylon (is that a big joke or what).P.T. Barnum said a hundred years ago that a sucker is born every minute, and that he never went broke underestimating the intelligence of people. A hundred years later, he is proven right ... again. Exhibit ""A"":Battlestar Galactica - Season One (2004)p.s. If you want to see a Sci-Fi epic, get the original. If you're looking for a cheap thrill, take a trip down to Pee Wee Herman's movie theater and save yourself some money."
1,It stinks,"I would like to ask Ron Moore,what was he thinking?The three hour episodes that aired on NBC,now I see why the ratings are low.I have the DVD to the original Galactica feature film and I get more sense out of it than what is in the new version.Sex,the space battles are not good like in the original,changing the Cylons including not hearing them talk,trash talikng and disrepecting in the Colonial warriors ranks,what's next?As I had mentioned in previous reviews,I am working on my own space war epic and I would like to give Mr Moore a big piece of advice,listen to the fans of the original version of Galactica."
2,A break from what was cool about BSG,"I love sci-fi and really enjoyed BSG when I was a kid. I was really dissapointed with this series though. Especially when the only decent TV sci-fi series right now is Stargate. I found the CG Cylons looked terrible and their ships looked even worse; I couldn't believe the moving red eye was in their ships, it looked terible! The main bad character is a female human Cylon (trying to save money by using humans). I am not into phony tough female characters. In my opinion that formula never works for the overall finish except supplying some eye candy. The female Starbuck Character is another version of this. The Captain of the Galactica seems to fill his role well but that's where it ends."
1,A contrived mix of other people's SF cliches and snail's pace plotting,"One would think that the advances in technology and hindsight would improve any retelling of the classic Battlestar Galactica 1978-79, but Ronald D. Moore's characters are as cookie-cuuter as those on General Hospital leading the viewer to take more interest in the plot. Unfortunately, the plot moves likes molasses leaving one to spot what SF movie/TV show the writers have ripped off this week.It is no wonder that Spongebob Squarepants gets more viewers than this turgid melodrama."
3,Awesome Show; Poor HD-DVD Transfer,"The show is stellar, but the packaging is quirky and oddly difficult to navigate (you have to screw and unscrew the HD-DVDs from rubber stoppers). Audio is good, but as previously stated, the transfer overly enhances the sharpness of the source material so much that it looks super grainy; like 300-caliber grainy. Releases like Heroes Season 1 in HD destroy the picture quality of this release, and it's sad because the show is awesome. Still worth owning, but don't expect to be blown away."
3,"good, not great","Well, this show could be so much better. In a whole season, not alot happens with the plot. Alot of the show focuses on characters. There needs to be a better balance between story and characters. Plus, the whole "" People are flawed"" is forced and overdone. The first season is good, but nothing to write home about."
5,Great Series,Didn't see it when it aired. My son told me about it and I can't stop watching it. Excellent acting and camera work. We'll see if the excellence continues with the other seasons. Surely hope so.
4,Fun to watch,Didn't watch the original and are having fun watching this series starting with Season one. We are enjoying it now
4,Ignore Americans like R Page....,"...who want you to think there are parallels to 9/11 and their country in this fine international series. It's nice that Page gave it a good rating, but it doesn't parallel 9/11 or America at all."
2,Manufacturing problems,"As reported by others, all of my disks arrived scratched. This does not seem to be the fault of Amazon as my set was securely packaged. In addition to the scratches, the Dolby TrueHD audio track on disk 2 is very noticeably out of sync with the picture. Since the problem only appears on that disk, it probably has something to do with the encoding. Hold off buying these and see if Universal corrects these problems. My set is going back for a refund."
1,Disc scratches,"I am a big fan of Battlestar Galactica, but not this HD-DVD set of season 1. I purchased the set and found that a couple of the discs had scratches on them, concentric to the disc. I returned to where purchased and they proceeded to open up a series of 4 sets, all with scratches on some discs. Clearly there is some manufacturing problem. Proceed with caution if you are purchasing this set and check your discs before it's too late to return. Just ended up getting my money back. Will wait until Universal cleans up their act with these discs..."
3,Bad Discs-lousy pacjaging,Wow. The shows great but... What's with he discs. 4 out of five were scratched and I bought SEALED in the box. I think I figured it out. The packaging is so bad with these little rubbery plasicky (knobs) that your supposed to stick the discs to are the culprit. I believe that whoever was the poor sap that got hired to make the discs stick to the packaging probably pushed and twisted and pushed like He!! to get them to work hence scratchng them. Too bad - I had to order another set/replacement. I sure hope those are ok..-Terry
5,"Kevin Smith was right, the new BSG rocks!","I can't add much to the priors but I finally broke down and started renting season 1. This is pretty awesome stuff. With the exception of the one episode where they reintroduced the XO's wife this was perfection. This sets the bar quite high for Sci Fi.I always liked the Babylon 5 series for gritty realism but this tears that off the wall of fame and tosses it in the ditch.I still cannot believe that someone could remake that dorky 1970's BSG and turn it into something so cool.I am so going to dig getting season 2 & 3 off netflix or wherever until I catch up.Many thanks to the many pitches on Ebert & Robert, especially Kevin Smiths pitch during a guest host spot where he pushed season 2.5 really hard. Thanks Kevin, I am so glad I listened.Ed."
4,The New Show Doesn't Dissapoint,"I waited for a while to get into this series, having been a big fan of the original series when I was a kid. I shouldn't have waited, this show is really good. The tone has changed with the times, but the miniseries pilot has several nice nods to the original series.Yes, Starbuck is a women this time, and while no one will ever replace Dirk Benedick; Katee Sackhoff makes the role her own and if you give her a chance, you'll really like her. All the actors do a fine job, Edward James Olmos and Mary McDowell always deliver, but a great standout in a smaller role is Aaron Douglas as Chief Tyrol.A Warning for parents, there is a pretty high level of sexuality and violence, which pretty much goes with the territory with Sci-Fi these days. Also this box set includes the mini-series pilot on the first disk, which is also sold separatly. I wound up accidentally buying them both.All in all it's a great show that I've enjoyed watching tremendously."
4,I have scratches too,"I have scratches too on my disks (4 of them). So far no problem in playback, but I have not watched through them all yet...As for quality the Mini Series does look bad. It looks like a composite blow up of the SD original. The episodes look good, A great deal better that crappy Cable!!!!! and better than SD-DVD. The HD sound is great!!, and yes goes out of sync on Disk 2. There is a shot with SB is in her viper that is not even close, but then comes right back into Sync aboard the Galactica. So this is a production problem, i am surprised they did not QC this better!I hope I do not have any playback problems, and they should deliver in better packaging.I hope they fix this before Season 2 comes out and Where is RAZOR in HD?"
5,Great drama in a sci-fi setting,"Bottom line - this is great drama. Riveting storyline and great acting combine to make this a can't miss. The sci-fi setting is the icing on the cake. It casts our world in a different setting, allowing the viewer to see current issues in a different perspective. The relationships among the characters are well-written and complex. Rolling Stone and MSNBC are right - this is one of the best shows on TV."
5,Top Notch,"I'm old enough to have watched the original series which I always thought campy and too cute. I ignored this series on the SCIFI channel (apparently). I'm not a follower of serialized television, totally skipped the XFILES and other weekly shows.So on a total whim I picked this up. I have just finished the last episode of season one. I ordered Season 2.0 once I was halfway through disc 2.This is not your parents ""Galactica"". The acting (across the board) is top notch, the characters have depth, the stories and plot lines are great, the effects are fabulous. This is top of the line drama (and science fiction).I can't wait till the new episodes begin in January. I'm a convert."
4,"4 points for DVD, 5 points for the show.","Must say that I am dissapointed with this DVD set. I had already seen all the 8 behind-the-scenes features(...)Missing from DVD are1) Writing A Dark, Sexy, Political SciFi Show2) Women In Pivotal Roles3) Like Father, Like Son4) Director's CutI had also seen the series lowdown on tv once.Also, the separate Mini-Series release has a 45 minute longMini-series lowdown and about 20 minutes of deleted scenes.The complete 1st season DVD set doesn't have these mini-series features. So now I must get the Mini-Series seperate disc aswell."
2,What the hell,"You have a war going on with blue ray and you relise this ? i ordered it from this site and came like everyones all scrached up, i ordered another set and another , with 3 in my hands i picked and choose and got one that is mint, discs and box, I""m hurt. An now that WB is leaving HD dvd and Paramount might fallow with dreamworks, i'm not sure if season 2,3 and rest will ever make it, I have season 1 and 2 on regular dvd was about to sale it off, and now i'm questioning it and am frustrated as rest of people here."
2,"Yup, disk scratches, recall please","Due to the cautions on disk scratches in the previous customer reviews I bought the set locally at a premium to ease the burden of return in the event the scratches were there. I'm sad to say the set had the very ""concentric scratches"" another reviewer has cited, and the scratches also commenced with disk 3 with varying degree of severity across 4, 5, and 6. A major drag having waited so long for the HD release and given the seemingly well documented problem on web blogs and reviews (not just Amazon) a major drag that major retailers are continuing to offer the faulty goods in collusion with the manufacturer. Corporations showing their true colors. Anyhow, after previewing the 2 good disks it looks like even though the disk is putting out 1080P it was only ever shot in something like 480P."
5,Great series,"Great series, great DVD. I watch it every Friday when a new episode comes out, and since season 2 just ended (or it's mid season I guess) I felt the need to get this DVD. Plus I just ordered a new laptop and felt the need to have watchable material for it's WSXGA screen when I get it! :D But a side from that this is a great series and I don't really reccomend buying the DVD unless you travel a lot or missed it. (and don't feel like looking up the sci-fi scheldule to see when it's on again) Plus you could just download them all like I did (it least with season 2 to save them), but there's barely anyone who still seeds the first season, which is why I bought it, plus for the above reasons, supporting the series, and of course high-definition dvd goodness.AWESOME SERIES!"
3,blu ray? rather dvd quality from 10 years+ ago,"For a blu ray it has bad quality. Well, it is not blu ray quality, but only a dvd which was produced more than 10 years ago.I just started to watch this show. I cannot tell anything about the show, but wanted to share my opinion on the quality. My oldest dvds have the same quality as this so called blu ray :-(Let's hope this TV Show is good as I bought the whole series due to great reviews. The show does not include really well know actors or even good looking ones. ""Normal"" looking actors. This is also a good thing as a show does not always need fancy ones :-)"
2,Decent show but not what it is hyped up to be,"Weak characters and its bad when my mom is watching something and says ""can we watch something else? Something more fun?""Steals from Japanimation Bubblegum Crisis, Bladerunner, and comic books liek Lobo ""Frag/Frak this and that"" pretty lame overall."
2,Just does'nt have it!,"I don't know if I just can't let go of the original or what,but I cannot get into this version.I have tried and tried to like it but I can't.The old Apollo and Starbuck interaction isn't there.It is too dark (all the time)It just doesn't have that something that a good series needs.Give me the Original (pre landing on earth when the series went to He!!)Please.---Update I have really gotten into this series,I do like it very much,so had to update this,very well written,still do not like a women for Starbuck.Shot my mouth off too fast"
2,WHAT A JOKE indeed,"As the ""war"" rages between old and new fans (what a joke!) it remains obvious that Universal DVDs are often defective, burned copies often look better, there are promised extras that aren't on the DVDs, and half season sets at almost full season prices are a rip-off. There are plenty of valid reasons to be less than pleased."
4,very good,You should get this!Note: if you get this you allso get the min series so unless you want the wide screen format don't bother gettng this and the (2003) Miniseries)
4,Great series!,"Characters who seem like real people, consequences and repurcussions, realistic emotions. I haven't seen more realistic science fiction anywhere! This series pulls you in, makes you care about what's going on, about what happens to the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this series!"
5,I,I enjoy Battlestar Galactica sooo much that I am trying to order all of the seasons. Jesus I love you for this.
4,Awesome show...You'll be hooked!!!,"Great story, writing and production. What the frak more could you wish for? Definitely some of the best written television in a while, science fiction or otherwise."
5,Thank the Gods for this Great Frakking Show!,"Hands down, this is the best show ever produced for television. It far surpasses the sci-fi genre. I was at first skeptical about the ""reimagined"" show, but once I started watching, I couldn't stop. I love that Starbuck and Boomer are now women and add so many levels to the show. It also helps that there are a lot - a lot - of hot guys in tight t-shirts on this show: Marry me Jamie Bamber!The storylines ask tough questions. The creators don't pull any punches. One day you like a character, the next day the character could be dead. It doesn't make for shiny, happy TV, it makes for entertaining frakking TV.I might also point out that I am not normally a fan of science fiction, but this show has me hooked."
2,"""The look and sound of perfect""... yeah, right","I'm extraordinarily disappointed in the quality of this HD DVD set. Not only were half of my discs scratched due to the ridiculously cheap packaging, but the audio on disc 2 (the second part of the mini-series) was massively out-of-sync and therefore unwatchable. This is perhaps my favorite show on tv, and to see a transfer that looked worse than my SDTV broadcast in some scenes along with the sync issues and scratching (and subsequent video skipping) is beyond inexcusable. If you love BG, then you'll want to wait until Universal actually releases a quality Season 1 set instead of this tripe."
3,HD-DVD not worth the extra cost,"Well I purchased this for my self thinking it would be a great addition to my HD collection. I was wrong, the video is grainy, it looks just as good if not WORSE then the DVD version Upconverted! I am very diappointed by this release. Save your self 25 dollars and get the DVD version."
4,Series keeps getting better,"This smart Sci-Fi series continues to get better. The only reason I didn't give this segment 5-stars is that the producers of the DVD did a good thing - they INCLUDED the ""Mini-series"" as part of Season I. Unfortunately, they didn't make it clear that it was included in the advertising so I purchased both which is akin to throwing my money down a rat-hole (Worm-hole?). Otherwise, this series lives up to all the hype, and then some...bg"
5,More than I expected,"I have been a Star Trek TNG/DS9/Voyager fan for many years. I've tried to watch other sci-fi shows, but just couldn't quite get into them like I did with Star Trek. Someone suggested I watch Battlestar Galactica. I reluctantly watched the miniseries, but what I found was that I couldn't turn it off. The next day I purchased the first season of this show and it has yet to disappoint. Each episode is amazing and I find myself wanting to watch a new one every night. My only gripe about this show is that apparently it only ran for four seasons, but I'm excited to watch the rest of the show. Season one was amazing."
5,Fracking amazing !,"I really fracking got into this fracking good series. It was fracking amazing. But seriously, great show (the characters use the word ""frack"" as a swearword constantly in the series).Fires on all cylinders. Great casting, great acting, great plot. The ""space combat"" scenes are really good. I like the fact that the ships don't look computer-generated. They look like real, three-dimensional objects with weight and mass. It is like watching the Matrix and Star Wars at the same time. It is amazing. There are tons of sub-plots and things that come back around, so to speak. Tricia Helfer (Nr. 6) is worth the price of admission alone. I would pay to watch her read the phone book for an hour. But she also can act. There is ""just enough"" humor in the series to keep it from being too somber, too. The ""religious"" stuff gets on my nerves a bit, but hey, this is fantasy, so what the heck.I put this up there with the ""Wire"" as the two best shows ever on TV (cable).Now go fracking watch it !!"
5,Great Start to a Great Show,"Just rewatched the full season, and I have to say, it's an absolutely astounding ride. There is so much complexity here, but the best part is that it ages so well. There isn't a lot of space fighting - it's a complicated political drama about a group of people trying to do what's right to keep themselves going. I love this show! You'll probably enjoy it if you have some interest in science fiction, and it will be better if you are familiar with Biblical and/or Greek philosophy, and I think that if you liked West Wing, you will feel very at home in this universe, surprising as that may sound."
3,Best Frakking Show ever!,Possibly one of the best space operas of our time. A great re-imagination of a classic. This episode is gripping and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat wondering whether mankind is doomed.
3,So so,The quality is not up to par with other blu rays and the packaging is really cheap. The one positive that stands out is the sound quality is very good but the picture is very grainy and doesn't look nearly as good as I had expected.
5,Quality entertainment,"Wonderfull show ! In the '70s I was too small and too far away to see the original series, so it's a fresh start for me and I think the new BG is awesome. I love the scripts, the cast, the music, the way it is fimed, the no-nonsense feeling of the entire show. I can't wait for the next season. This is definitley well worth buying."
5,Finally!! Battlestar Galactica on Amazon Prime!,"Finally they have this series available on Amazon Prime! Great series, great characters, twists and turns in the plot, and now you have the entire series available at your finger tips. Give this show a try if you've never had the opportunity to get into it, a really good series.P.S. If you like scifi stuff check out the Firefly series which is also available free through Amazon Prime now. Wonderful series, can't say enough good stuff about it!"
1,Whole DVD Set Damaged,"The quality of this HD DVD set is offensive. This is not just a problem with the packaging. Some of my discs were scratched, yes, but even the ones that were not have audio sync problems and general playback issues (such as causing my HD DVD player to freeze, etc).If these don't get recalled I doubt I will be buying any Universal HD DVDs soon."
2,Poor quality HD,"Poor quality HD, barely better than DVD version and in some scenes is it worse. A lot of noise and grain. Don't bother, get DVD version, any upconverting player will do a better job. Not worth the money."
3,Not enough Sci-fi,"The first season was hard to watch- too much sex and politics- also unbelievable warp concept of God. I ended up fast forwarding past allot of it. When I watch sci-fi, I want sci-fi, which they had some but not as much I would have liked."
5,Nerd Soap opera,This show sucked me in and I spent many a late night watching until I had finished the entire season. Anyone will enjoy this show if they give it half a chance not just the sci-fi oriented. Please watch.
5,One of the greatest shows to come out of left field!,"Lets face it this show had everything going against it. 1st it is on the SCi Fi channel. 2nd it was made after a cheezy tv show that failed after the 1st season (sorry to the hardcore fans!) 3rd it came at a time when Star Trek had reached it's saturation point. But face it if it is a well writen and acted show they will come. The best part with this season is you get the miniseries with it. This is the part I like best, everything does not get all wrapped up at the end of every eppisode. Unlike most tv shows the problem is presented then 10 minutes later there is a neatly comprised ending that makes us feel all warm and fuzzy. By the way if you like that type of show, this may not be for you. This show works much the opposite, just when you think it can not get any worse boom it does. All I can stress is give the show a chance and you will be hooked. Oh and for the visual people out there this show rivales most effects from any motion picture."
5,"Great series, HD-DVD is a great value","First, the first season of Battlestar Galactica lived up to our expectations. 'BG' is a pretty entertaining sci-fi show, and we watched the first season over the course of a few days.That being said, the second-market HD-DVD discs are a great value. The Blu-Ray discs have been slow to come out (other than an expensive series set), so our options at the time were regular dvds or the HD-DVDs. True, HD-DVD is a dead format, but if you still have a player, picking up a few cheap discs might be worth it. For us, it certainly was- the high-def HD-DVDs were cheaper than the DVD set! Of course we also enjoyed the higher resolution.Thoroughly happy with our purchase."
5,Dynamic Show!,"I was hesitant to watch BG, but with my husbands encouragement I started and was quickly hooked! Before the first season was over I felt like I knew the characters and was constantly surprised with story lines. It is an unpredictable, fast-paced, and entertaining show! I would recommend it to men and women alike. I wanted to start season 2 as soon as I finished watching the first!Battlestar Galactica - Season One"
5,Excellent sci-fi drama,"The miniseries on disc 1 of Battlestar Galactica Season 1 would, as a standalone movie, compete with some of my favorite films. Taken with the rest of Season 1, this is some of the most entertaining television I've ever watched and is a must-see for science fiction fans. Though it's not without the occasional silly trope or unbelievable twist, Season 1 of Galactica stands as evidence of exactly how far the show tumbled in its third and fourth seasons."
4,A good implementation of a Sci-Fi program,"Battlestar Galactica is a good show. It brings up really fascinating concepts, but doesn't always deliver in the end. It doesn't transcend to great, but it is very much worth watching. If you like science fiction, you should pick up season one to see if it vibrates on your frequency."
5,A gift from the lords of Cobol,This is the one we've been waiting for. Season 1 plus the miniseries. All of it. One set. One purhase. One chunk of shelf space. 'nuff said.
4,Galactica IS sci fi,Mark Serrahn says this is not sci fi. Ignore him. This series IS sci fi. Nice try Mark. Better luck next time.
5,SciFi for everyone to watch,"I will skip the epsiode by episode reviews and just say this- 1. this is one of the deepest, most thought out, and compelling action\dramas ever put on TV. 2- Pretty much perfect casting and performances. 3- Winner of the Peabody award (for general excellence in television) which is not a sci-fi genre award, but one that has been given to the likes of 60 minutes, ER, and Hill Street Blues. If you have not seen this show do your self a favor and get this set, you will get your money's worth."
4,Great Series,Our grown sons recommended Battlestar Galactica and recommended getting Season one with the mini-series that showed origins of show. My wife and I have enjoyed it.
5,The best show on TV,"I highly recommend this show. It's a very intriguing, thrilling tale of human survival. It has terrific continuity and the characters and plot develop in very interesting ways. Time Magazine named it one of the six best dramas on TV and Newsday named it ""the best show on TV.""I recommend this show even if you're, like me, not a fan of sci-fi. Battlestar Galactica is very different from other sci-fi shows. There is minimal techno-babble and no lessons in alien culture (in fact there are NO aliens on this show). It is first and foremost a human drama and the writing is very intelligent."
5,Excellent and Entertaining,"I really enjoyed the original Battlestar Galactica series and was not sure I'd like the remake. My son convinced me to watch the new series. It's great--not the same, but very well done."
5,Sci Fi and Drama at its Best,"Don't miss out on one of the best sci-fi series to come down the pike in recent memory. This is drama at its best. A very human drama that gives us characters with flaws and stubborn nobility played against the backdrop of the near apocalytpic destruction of the human race at the hands of their creations - the Cylons.Even the Cylons don't escape the very human flaws that plague our characters with such emotions as jealousy and anger.This is an amazing show and you shouldn't pass it up if you get the chance. You will be snagged from the opening moments of ""33"" to the amazing season finale."
4,"""Greatest TV Sow on TV""","Love this version, does include the mini series and the 14 episodes of Season 1, plus extras. Can't wait for a complete Season 2.0/2.5 DVD to come out."
4,Take It For What It Is.,"The new BSG series is a dark and serious show with little of the swashbuckling laughs of the old 1970's version. Never-the-less, it's well-made and has an intriguing take on the same events as the old show. My one problem is that, like any remake, the directors and producers seem bent on remaking everything. There are some things I'd have rather seen unchanged, but these directors have to be original (odd when they are ""remaking"" a show). Also, read into it what you will, but it's simply a TV show; parallels between it and today's world (9/11, etc) I believe are just a cinematic technique for drawing in the viewer. Nothing more significant than that!"
1,This Show Makes Me Feel Icky,"I can't explain why that is. I only want to make it known that I cannot get into this show or seemingly any of the others on. I know a lot of people are into it. I tried. It didn't happen. I'm not sure if I felt manipulated or that the show lacked a sophisticated realism. Maybe not. Something is just not right. There seemed to be a lack of emotional depth. A superficiality. A lack of...of...I'm at a loss. An ambitious, hollow, vapid endeavor, like Lost or Heroes or Stargate Atlantis or Firefly. Since X-Files and ST:TNG ended, I'm not sure there's been any sci-fi series that has touched me. I need something that will challenge me, perhaps, and none of this stuff is doing that. They all just seem, I don't know, dumbed down, or something. No offense. Maybe it's an overly fashionable, trendy, commercialized quality they all have. Icky vibes."
2,dreary,I started watching this and lost interest as season one went on. That's too bad because the production values are there for this to have been much better. It should have been much more captivating. Instead I just felt like I was being strung along as the writers made it all up as it went down hill.
2,we need the new Doctor Who,"It's been said that it's unfair to expect too much fun or humor from this series, but the reason fun and humor was expected is because it's called ""Battlestar Galactica"". You can't blame people for being put off by the major changes. Sadly one shouldn't expect anything close the the tone of the original. It's too bad the new Doctor Who isn't available in the U.S. instead. It's new yet faithful. That's the way you do it."
2,Could have been better,"The shortcuts for emotes is about the best thing this keyset offers, next to toggling on/off UI for 'clean screens', all the other shortcut keys on the right hand side could have been better served as shortcuts to either a) skill use or b)party member targeting. With this you are left with the top row of numbers (1-8) to use skills and the mouse for party member targeting, so you might as well use a normal keyboard instead of reprogramming some keys. The right handed movement keys could have been left out as many players opt for the wasd keys and replaced with the 2 aforementioned shortcuts.So all in all only get this if you are a major fan of guild wars and want a pretty keyset."
4,Daimler-Benz conspired with the Nazis during the war.,"The basic premise of this book is that Daimler-Benz, the maker of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, placed profit before principle and committed criminal acts during World War II. The evidence is displayed as if presented by a prosecutor in court. There is little room for doubt or deception. The book is not always easy to read and the story line is at times hard to follow. There are too many abbreviations that require frequent clarification. Maps should have been included that would have assisted the reader in following the location of the many Daimler-Benz plants. The ""story"" is important and represents an original contribution, however, the book could have been more ""user friendly""."
5,Great way to save space,"I didn't think this item would make a big impression, but it has proven to be a really great way to save space in our freezer. I exclusively breastfeed but I have been pumping a few ounces each day since our son was about three weeks old. I use Medela and Gerber bags and both fit in the container. I freeze 1-3 ounces in each bag. I love the way the container squeezes the bags so that they freeze flat. I have about 20 Medela and 10 Gerber bags in the container and I still have about 1/3 of space left. The Gerber bags are slightly taller but still fit in the container with the lid on. If you are considering buying this item, but aren't sure, I would say go for it. I didn't think it would make a big difference, but it has because it isn't just a storage container, it is also a great way to initially freeze the bags flat."
2,"Very large, takes up a lot of space","We have a large, new 2012 Samsung French door refrigerator with a large pull out drawer freezer and this did not work for us. It is very bulky and large. The photo is decieving because the bottom and sides are very thick and hollow which makes this more bulky than it appears. The idea is great and although it can store around 20 flat frozen bags upright, it won't help you once it's full and I doubt many freezers can hold more than 1 of these organizers inside. I suggest that you lay your single milk bags down flat to freeze and then simply move it to gallon sized zip lock bags."
4,great way to keep a neat freezer,"I would have given this 5 stars had it not been for the cover that doesn't stay closed properly. Its not an issue though since eventually I'll probably be using the lid to keep the bags that have already been frozen. Simple and practical product, it flattens the milk bags while the milk freezes so you end up with flat frozen milk bags rendering for more bags to fit in freezer.."
5,Saves Room in the Freezer! Keeps Milk Date Organized!,"We love this item because it very simply compresses milk bags so they freeze flat. This maximizes space in the freezer. The container is also excellent in that it keeps milk date-organized ~ My husband has no problem grabbing the front bag...the latest date while leaving the most recent in the back. :) Makes milk freezing and storage simple, quick and easy. We have found it holds 10 frozen bags with 5oz of milk per bag. The lid can be used to organize additional frozen bags (holds an additional 11-12 frozen 5oz bags) or it snaps on as a lid."
3,Useful product,"I like this product for upright storage, but after using it for a few months I realize that it may have not been worth the money. I end up freezing my milk laying flat in the freezer, and then putting it into the organizer afterward. When I freezed the milk standing up in the organizer, it was always in weird shapes and sometimes had leaking problems. The tension was nice keeping the milk upright by date as it was used, but I have so much frozen at this point that I just use bread loaf pans instead."
3,"Organizer is ok, but it occurs more space","I am a 4 months baby's mum. I collect my breast milk with breast milk bag into the fridge without organized at first. When the more and more breast milk were put into fridge, I found that there was no space to put other food in my fridge...So I tried to organize them to save my crowed fridge. I brought two The First Years Breastflow Milk Storage Organizers in Christmas Day, and received them 4 days later. When I first looked at the organizers, I was so surprised. I can organize my breast milk easily and still save the space. But the cover of the organizer is too high for me. I think it's necessary to match a cover witch have the same height with it's 'body'. I just put it to the lowest part of my fridge which has a big space. So if you have a big fridge, the organizer is quite nice for you."
5,Works great!,"Fits perfectly in the freezer. Not a big fan of the bags that come with the unit, I think the Lanisoh bags work and fit better. Great for organization though."
5,Helps you get organized!,"I like how this product helps me stay organized! I used to just throw the milk bags in the freezer and they were all odd shaped, harder to defrost, and you had to hunt around for the oldest ones. Highly recommend this for organization and ease of use!"
5,Great product.,"This organizer is much larger than I thought, I'm glad we have a large fridge because it takes up quite a bit of room! But I love it. It fits lots of bags of milk! I use the lanisoh bags instead of the first years ones. I haven't tried the first years bags, but the lanisoh ones fit perfectly!"
5,Great for chest freezer,I like this product I just wish it was cheepier. I bought 4 of them and use both the lid and the case. It hold a lot of bags espeically if you lay them flat while they freeze. I bought a deep freezer and I have filled up all of them. If you plan on having a lot of milk I recommend this as a storage tool.
4,It does what it is supposed to do.,"I had read a review that said this works well with the lansinoh storage bags, it does for the most part if they are not already frozen. I had been previously laying my bags flat in the freezer and purchased this so that I didn't have to keep a neat corner in my freezer and my milk bags would be safe from breakage. The container is nice, but I receive the samples of the first year bags, and I do not like them, the lansinoh bags are so much nicer. I would be concerned that the first year bags would break easier. Now that I am just adding my bags at the back of it, it is not too bad, the lansinoh bags are just a little wider than this storage container."
2,Doesn't work as intended,"I was disapointed in this product. It claims to ""Maximizes space by freezing milk flat."". In my experience, putting the milk behind the spring loaded plate makes all the milk push to the top therefore freezing the bag in a very awkward way that takes more space. I prefer to lay the bag flat in the freezer then place it in the storage once it's frozen flat. It also claims ""Works with most brands of milk storage bags."". When frozen flat the Lansinoh bags are too wide for the white base storage; however they do fit in the clear cover when turned upside down and used as additional storage."
3,Ok if you buy it @ BabiesRUs,"The item is OK as an organizer. I used it with Medela bags, it fits about 10 of those if the bags are nicely flattened), so it's good if you need only few stashed. However at BabiesRUs it costs $16.99, whereas at the time of a review Amazon offers it for $23.75 on sale(!). Considering additional shipping cost, the difference definitely is not worth the convenience of a front door delivery..Also, if you are building a bigger stash, this organizer makes no sense, it takes too much room in the freezer, easier to use 1g freezer bags. Not as neat, but more practical.Not suitable for Lansinoh bags."
1,Tears Lansinoh Bags,"This container is not quite wide enough to store Lansinoh bags. If you use it with Lansinoh bags (the best bags in my opinion) then you may tear the seams of your bags and lose the milk to freezer burn and/or leaking upon thawing. Other than that, this is a great product, just be sure that your bags will fit. I love the idea of this, but just be sure it's compatible with the bags you use."
2,Bulky and does not fit Ameda or Lansinoh bags well,"I really liked this concept but find it to not be all that practical. I've actually sent the item back. The container is rather bulky and is tall with the lid on. I tried using this with both Ameda and Lansinoh bags. The Ameda bags do not fit well because of the pour spout on the side. I froze my Lansinoh bags flat outside of this container as it gets them flatter. Otherwise the container would only flatten the milk into the bottom portion of the bag. By freezing the Lansinoh bag separately, it is very thin but is marginally too wide to fit in the storage container. I ended up just batching frozen milk in gallon size Ziploc bags for extra protection at the recommendation of a friend. That seems to work better for me than the limited storage capacity of the container."
4,Okay,Difficult to push button down to extend tray but the divider is a handy addition. I like the divider overall.
4,wish it was bigger,but I do like the spring action. It really helps for fitting a lot of bags in the container. But I guess its the size it is so it can fit in most freezers.
3,"Good system, but hard to open and use inside the freezer","I like the way the system works - it freezes your milk flat, and keeps it vertical so that it's easy to read the labels and pick out the bag you want. The oldest milk is in front, which makes it easy to find and use first. I use it with the Medela bags, and it works just fine.However, I do have a hard time working the sliding compressing mechanism while the box is inside the freezer. It takes two hands to slide the panel back (which isn't practical while holding a bag of milk), and even so it is awkward enough that I find it easier to just take the box out of the freezer and do it on the countertop. So minus two stars for the difficulty of adding new bags of milk."
2,They could be better!!,I liked how light the shoe was. But the third time I wore them they ripped. They have a BIG hole them. They could have been made a lot better!So I only wore them three times and then they saw there way to the trash.
3,"Great knife, but...","Great knife to be so inexpensive, but this is the foreign/Chinese version of this knife. The quality is not up to the American version of the Kershaw brand. Blade does not hold a great edge, but I use it for a box opener, so no biggie. Easily slides on and off my pocket, and can open with one hand. If you are looking for the higher quality version, be prepared to spend at least twice the money, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for..."
5,best book in the world,My dad bought this book for me a few years ago and I didn't think i would like it but i tried it out anyway. it was the best book ever. i lent it out to so many people that i never got it back but everyone who read it loved it.
2,"Cut the movie, leave the extras.","Typical with these ""B"" movies, it all looks very cheap and the story line stinks to say the least. Enough said about the movie.On the other hand, the Extras make it all worth it if you are a big Julie Strain fan. All of the cut out nudity is included as well as a shower and bath segment that had nothing to do with the movie. Skip the movie and just watch the extras."
4,"Silly Sorority, Fun Film, Great Extras","Julie Strain heads the most successful sorority on campus (yet it only has four members). These women are true man-eaters. But when it comes to actually dispatching the young men, it is Strain who does all of the dirty work.The sorority makes mucho dinero by selling meat pies on campus. They are very popular. Of course we know what they are really made of.The movie concerns Strain's move for greater power during a 20th anniversary and how the whole scheme might be coming undone.Veteran Brinke Stevens is excellent as a founding member bent on revenge. Her pouncing scenes have to be seen to be believed.The disk comes packed with DVD extras including home movies of Julie Strain and her sister acting rowdy, out takes, deleted scenes, extended scenes and more.A great B-Film with some classic B-Girls. Although it is had to believe that the ""young"" Strain in the flashbacks could ever have matured into the Strain we know and love is rather far fetched."
4,Terribly funny,"This movie is low quality (the DVD arrived quickly and in excellent shape), but is a hilarious couple of hours of entertainment. I don't know if they intended for it to be taken seriously or not, but I find this movie to be an awesome find for silly movie nights with friends."
4,Damages DVD Review,"Damages 2nd season is okay for entertainment. I bought this used and the dvd itself was not damaged, but the plastic case it came in was shattered."
3,Where is the damn bluray?,"""Damages"" is one of the most intelligent and twisty legal thrillers ever to grace television with first-rate performances by Glenn Close and Rose Byrne. Terrific show, but where is the bluray version? The first season looked aamazing in hi-def, so I'm not sure why the same treatment was not afforded. Give us the blu...the show gets five stars...this sloppy presentation is a two star effort..."
1,damages season 2,ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TELEVISION. WHERE IS THE BLURAY EDITION? PURCHASED SEASON ONE ON BLU. WANT SEASON 2 ON BLU. UNBELIEVABLE!
5,As good as Season 1!,"My husband and I started watching ""Damages"" on the recommendation of a friend just before the start of season 3. We had watched season 1 on DVD and loved it and knew we'd need to see S2 before the new season began. None of our local stores had it in stock, so we purchased it from Amazon (at a great price) and received it promptly. We began ""power watching"" the episodes one after another, and were so happy that S2 was as good as S1! William Hurt played an amazing role, and it was great to see Ellen's character developing. Plus, the appearance of a ""bad guy"" from S1 made it fun. We are officially hooked!"
5,Damages series,"Love the series!, got it for my husband. However there were a few times that we experienced some glitches, and break ups of flow! Otherwise fun to get involved."
5,Love this show!,"""Damages"" is one of the most creative and captivating shows on television. The acting is outstanding, the plotting is complex and imaginative, and the characters practically leap off the screen. Season Two is every bit as good as Season One, and the continuing appearances by William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, and Timothy Oliphant enhance the outstanding performances of the series regulars. In a medium dominated by reality show junk and cable series, FX has hit a home run."
4,The Wood DVD,I bought this dvd as a gift for my daughter. This is one of her favorite movies. We are both fans ofTaye Diggs and Omar Epps. The DVD is of excellent viewing quality.
4,Good Film,Three friends think back over the history of their friendship on the day one of them is to wed. It's very funny and romantic.
3,Pretty Good Could Have Been a New Classic,I Really thought this Film was Cool.but it went on too Long in spots.I feel the this film had more Plot&Interest than the Best Man.but the pacing of this film was too Slow at times.if Writting Better&Trimmed in Spots with Better Editing this would have Been a New Classic.cuz The Acting was Solid.The Actors&Actress Gave a Good Solid Performance.I Wish they had done More with the COP Scene.it was Left Empty.A Pretty Good Film though.
5,Its a winner,"This is a great movie. It totally takes you back in the day, and its a great movie to see with anyone, your girlfriends, or your man. Its funny, romantic and never had a dull moment. I'd recommend this movie to everyone...especially those who grew up in the eighties, like myself. Talk about a winner....all three actors were the bomb...."
5,All that!,"To be real, I enjoyed this more than The Best Man. This movie made me look at Luther's ""If this world were mine"" in a totally different light. I will always consider this a personal favorite."
1,Beware of DVDs Formatted for other Countries at low prices,"I bought three DVDs(The Wood was one of them)and the DVDs were in European codes which means they won't play in the United States unless you own a ""special"" DVD player. I'm very unhappy with my purchase. My recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country. This is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices."
5,The Best Movie In The World,This is my favorite movie of all time. I was still in highschool when I seen it the first time and feel in love with it. It show's that as males we shouldn't be afraid to show or feelings on matters of the heart. The acting was brilliant (coming from a inspiring actor/screenwriter). I my for this movie is so strong. when it first came out on dvd I watched it at least 4 times a day for like three times a Months. It's a great film and if you are into really goog black cinema this movie on friendship and love is for you. Trust Me.
3,"Likeable, but bland.","Likeable but somewhat dull coming-of-age tale concerning 3 buddies who grow up in Southern California. Taye Diggs and Omar Epps star, but the real winners are the actors who play the younger version of their characters. LisaRaye also makes a nice appearance as the fiancee. Unfortunately, this gets a 3-star rating mainly because there are virtually no extras on this package. All we get is a trailer. No documentary. No interview. If you're looking to pass 2 hours of your time on a Sunday afternoon, you could do worse than this."
3,"The First ""Big Chill"" Flick for the 80s Kids","This movie was about nostalgia -- remembering what it was like to be young and black in the 80s. My favorite cousins lived in Inglewood when we were kids so I vividly remember listening to that music and doing all the growing up stuff in Inglewood. (The Randy's donut is an Inglewood landmark -- that brought a smile to my face).My feelings about this movie are mixed: It doesn't disappoint in evoking strong nostalgic feelings, however the overall plot was weak and the flashbacks made the movie seem disjointed.It was worth watching once, but I wouldn't watch it again."
4,good,trying to get in a chick pantz put this on with a bag of popcorn and you have her at the end just hold her throught the whole moive i promise you this
3,Hello 80's,If VH1 did a show about life in the typical middle class African American home in the 80's and its impact on music this movie would gain cult status. I love all of the actors in this one-especially Richard T Jones (Judging Amy & Soul Plane) this movie reminded me of my life growing up and I grew up in a big city! A must see for anyone who graduated in the late 80's!
3,The Wood,"My order was placed only after Amazon contacted the store. Now that I have the movie, I can only watch it on my laptop because I live in the US and the Region is European. I'm just happy to have the movie."
5,Great movie for those with close childhood friends,The Wood is a great movie for those who have childhood friends that you have been through a lot with. These guys have experienced the good and bad and 10 years later they are still good friends. I highly recommend this film.
5,Review,"I received this movie waay before I thought I would, but this is Amazon, so I should have known I would receive it shortly. Anyway, I am pleased with the movie, as I knew I would be. It's one of my favorites with all the flashbacks to the wonderful wonderful 80s. :)"
5,Great Book,Great information we've used it a number of times. We're new into biking and I like finding new places to ride.
4,Satisfied my curiosity,"Unlike most of these reviewers I could not really get into Lady Susan. Maybe at a later date. The Watsons was like an introduction to some published works but short and unfinished. However there is a note at the end describing by JA herself how it would end. the best version of Sanditon is found in the book, Sanditon by Jane Austen and another Lady.Sanditon By Jane Austen and Another Lady (New American Library)It is finished charmingly!"
3,Abandoned Works,I just can't get into the satire of some of Austen's works. Obviously Austen wasn't able to complete these. Not my favorite.
4,"Jane Austen, always good",This is a great audiobook for the car. Jane Austen's stories never get old. This audiobook is read well. It's also a good value for the money.
1,way too much money for too little story,"This audio book contains 3 incomplete stories by Jane Austin - this I knew before purchasing the package. However, the stories are woefully incomplete and therefore the $60+ price tag is too high."
2,not what I was hoping for,"when i ordered this cd i hoped that the music was different. i already had bought the dvd art of living, wich i love by the way but this cd is not what i expected. the music is soimetimes very loud and a bit wicked. one song you here a woman sing but it's a bit spooky. i give ayurvedic massage and had hoped that this music would be great as background music but unfortunately it's not the cause."
3,Not what you're looking for.,"As the first biography in English of Saigo Takamori and the first work to use original source material to examine his near-mythic status in Japanese history, this book does have value. However, it is not for the general reader. Though prodigious research was obviously behind this work, little accommodation is made to narrative thrust. The book appears to have been expanded from the author's masters thesis with passages which vary, often jarringly, in tone from the academic material. For those seeking a complete and more readable but still reputable history of the real man behind the character in ""The Last Samurai"" a better choice by far is the book by that name written by Mark Ravina."
3,Worth Reading,"This is a worthwhile read, mainly because it is the only book in English on a fascinating subject: the life of Saigo Takamori. Much credit is to be given to Yates for exposing the true Saigo, which is quite different from the Saigo myth that has grown up in Japan over the last 130 years. Many pages are devoted to what Saigo's true motivations and skills were. My biggest disappointment was the lack of any detail about the military operations that Saigo conducted. The worst example of this is that the entire 7-month Seinan War is covered in about 2 pages."
4,Good resource for beginning students,"These plays are short and sweet, with a bit of humor or twist. The vocabulary is simple enough for first-year high school students, and when acted can be followed even by non-Latin speakers. Each play is a few pages long, about 5 minutes performed; each clearly outlines the cast and prop requirements. With the exception of ""Pyramus and Thisbe"", the other stories are created from situations which might occur in the first century BCE or CE. The collection is really very versatile. They fill a challenging niche by offering engaging material which can still appeal to students early in their Latin studies. They have made good supplemental material in my junior high and senior high Latin classes."
2,You should be able to open it,"My husband mentioned that he needed a box to keep pencils in that he can carry in one of his bass cases. He writes music and makes notations at lessons, etc. and doesn't want loose pencils rolling around next to his instrument. I saw this case and thought it looked nice. It does look nice in the hand but my husband could not get it open. He had to struggle with it for about 1/2 an hour and he didn't want to force anything. When he finally got it open, he waxed the edges of the sliding lid to make sure he can open it in the future. We thought we were home free until he went to put some pencils in it. It is too short to hold a standardized wood graphite pencil that has only been sharpened once. I know we should have checked the measurements but when you see an item labelled ""pencil box"" , you sort of expect that a pencil will fit in it."
5,I Couldn't Be Happier !,"I bought this box in April and it has become my faithful companion ever since. As a result I am doing 1000% more life drawings than I ever had before. All I need ever bring is the medium. It is very sturdy and yet quite attractive in its simplicity. I can take it out in public places w/o attracting undue attention. I like the idea of the rounded end. I can drop it into a jacket, vest or pants pocket w/o sharp corners doing any harm or poking me. It slides readily into a side pouch on a back pack or camera bag and can take a real beating wherever you toss it. I would not do any of that with a pouch ! ""Too small"" ? That one perplexes me. I carry a 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" WhiteStroke eraser, a 2"" KUM eraser stick, an Faber-Castell fine point erasr pencil, a metal pencil sharpener, a full sized wooded HB & a 4B, a full sized woodless 6B & an 8B and oh yeah, a #4 stumpy. Too small ? I think not. This is perfect for drawing on the go."
4,Smaller internally than I realized,"Can't complain too much, the dimensions are just what is promised. The case will protect pencils well, but is smaller than I had realized, and yet, pretty big on the outside. Probably wouldn't get it again if something happens to it, but I have no complaints about the product itself."
2,too small,"Such a nice case, looks-wise. Organic, wooden, with a nice logo burned in. But! I need not only an assortment of pencils in my box, I also like to bring along an eraser, a sharpener, a couple of stumps, etc. The box is a little too short and a little too shallow to be really practical, even for a brief sketching trip. I'd love to have one like this but both longer and deeper."
1,Broken DVD,I paid for a brand new DVD and I received it cracked (damaged). My daughter is crying as I am typing this review. What a disappintment.Update: the return process online is so easy and painless and the replacement shipment was executed immedietely and I printed the free UPS return label instantly from their return page online. I was shocked for Amazon's prompt and high quality service. I will continue shopping Amazon.com. I am not that disappointed knowing my purchase with Amazon.com is secure. They are really professional and I shop amazon.com comfortably.
1,cant watch this,"The dvds are ntsc!!! we ordered from australia expecting the dvds to be suitable for our region, there was no mention of them being ntsc on the product information page!!"
1,Please ban this show before my head explodes!,"Caillou is terrible, even for a baby show. The visuals are VERY OUTDATED, and the background has a terrible white border. Caillou is boring and dosen't really have the right topics for it's target audience. 2 year olds won't understand what a Zamboni does! At one point Caillou spent an entire episode learning his street address, what fun. Now here is what made my head almost explode: my sister was watching one of the older episodes with the puppets (had to fast forward through that), and caillou's voice started to get an awful quality. His voice was really high pitched, missed syllables, and almost sounded British! They might have fixed that in this DVD, but I wouldn't take any chances.Overall, I would even recommend Little Bill over this, at least that show had a jazzy feel to it. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
2,"Ok, but not great","This is not quite like the original Caillou from Dish Network's Sprout channel. I don't know what the difference is for sure, but my grandson does not like to watch it so much."
5,Great family entertainment,"This is a wonderful, wholesome DVD. I love the fact that the family is complete (both Mom AND Dad), and they even have the grandparents too. This video has the traditional values that's so missing in some videos recently. I found nothing objectionable in this video and there were no scary scenes at all---something I'm happy about. Nothing horribly dramatic for them to have to ""work through."" Just common fun everyday things. So far this is definitely one of our very favorite Caillou DVD's. I even enjoy watching it!"
5,Quick shipment and good condition.,Received my product quickly and in good order. It was perfect timing for a trip with my child.
2,Calliou,"I was expecting some more content in the video.Nevertheless, my 2 year old loves it and I am glad he is learning from it."
4,Good entertainment,Bought as a Christmas present for my Granddaughter. Keeps her entertained and I don't mind watching with her. Cute movie
5,good,nice little books-have many in the series-teache good lessons to the little one. Easily accepted from their favorite cartoon character
1,So mad!,Dvd region says its for region 1 which is Canada and USA however my DVD will play the commercials and the first 2 minutes of an episode and then will stop because I'm supposedly not in the right region! Very dissatisfied.
5,caillou the savior,great buy!! My son loves it. It's long enough and keeps him entertained. He is only 18months. It came in handy for our 3 hr plane ride. It's a great investment if you have toddlers..
4,Good little speakers,"I got these to run with a pair of JBL e60s. They are pretty good. Good price. I can't complain. Obviously they are nothing special if you have money to spend, but if you are strapped for cash, they are fantastic. Good sound, nice size, great look."
4,Great speakers for the price,"The best feature of these speakers is the price. For $100, I'm very satisfied. They look good on the wall as surround speakers as well. They definitely wouldn't be able to handle being the anchor or front speakers of a system, but they're perfect for surround or back speakers on a 7.1 system."
5,Great speakers for the price,not the best speakers out there but for the money they are a great pair of speakers for side and rear surround crisp clear you can hear every high and low sounds with no distortion at all i have seen these speakers being sold in other stores for more for one then what amazon is selling the pair for great speaker for the price if you dont have a fat wallet
2,Disappointed Based on Reviews Read,"Bought them to replace a 15 year old pair of wall mounted Hitachi speakers. After a side-by-side comparison prior to wall mounting the new ones, I was somewhat startled and disappointed to find the older Hitachi speakers had better all-around sound and volume. I would not recomment these speakers to anyone who wants volume and clarity."
2,Civil War Generals of the Confederacy (History Makers),"A good book for someone just getting into civil war history. For those who have read more than a book or two about the war, it's deffinately not worth your time or money."
4,"Good size map, easy to read, light weight.","This map is a good size and easy to read. However, when it was hung by push pins, just straightening out the bottom ends caused the upper corners to tear past the pins. We really weren't tugging much to do the straightening and had to be careful hanging and smoothing it out the second time around. The laminate could have been just a bit thicker to improve quality."
5,Road Trip,"Over the years we have traveled much of the United States, parts of Canada, and Mexico in our motorhome. We bought this large map to outline our travels -- part of the adventure of travel is to see where you have been.This map has given us an opportunity to outline our travels in perfect scale. Our travels show up nicely once we use a Sharpie pen to cover the routes we have traveled.We had the map mounted onto a poster board and it hangs on our ""travel"" wall perfectly."
5,Rodney:,The movie set works perfect... What else can I say if you ever seen the Rodney TV series you know it is a great show.
5,Rodney is Awesome!,I LOVE THIS SHOW. I was so disappointed when it was cancelled. It was one of the funniest shows ever on tv. WORTH THIS PRICE!!!! I've been waiting on it to come out since it went off the air. Buy it!
5,Great B-Sides!,"How can someone say they do not like Work and Non-Work!? That is a great album! Okay, now getting back to Furure Crayon! This has some good 60's Psychedelics on this album as well as Electronic Melodies! I am buying the vinly this weekend! Get this album if you enjoy their other work!"
5,Great performance!,"I am enjoying this performance tremendously, its a great companion to my older, standard, Kubelik recording. Sound quality is a big plus. Overall an enjoyable and great buy."
3,China up to World War II,"This book was originally published under the title ""The Four Hundred Million"" a short but comprehensive history of China and its people.In the old style of history writing the rulers are still looked at the most and you will read about all the dynasties both Chinese and foreign that ruled this ancient country. From the mythical start up to China in the Second World War because that is where this book ends. Mao is only mentioned once as the chairman of the communist party in China.As it says in the dustjacket, it's not a dry collection of facts but a biography of a nation which already shows some signs of what was to come in the decade after this book."
5,A Haunting Tale,I read this book years ago and found it unspeakably sad and haunting. I remember it as if I read it yesterday. An uncommon and insightful view of a white boy and the last of a group of native people that is treated with beautiful sensitivity. Recommended hightly.
5,Cool Beanie!,"The beanie has a really cool black subdued skull and fits really well and the material quality is excellent! I highly recommend it for bikers, or biker wannabees like me!"
3,Cant see the skull.,I have a lot of Willie G skull items. So I had to get this beanie. For the price its not really worth it. You know the skull is there but noone else will notice it unless their a foot away.
5,so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These dolls look so awesome! I don't have a Madison and my poor nolee(club birthday, the best one)is losing her hair. I can't wait to get these dolls!"
2,not worth it.,"Just got this item recently to split my vga output on my comp. This particular item is not worth the price. The cables are not shielded, and you will get ghosting. Even tried buying some ferrite cores to no effect. Do youself a favor and don't be cheap. For a couple extra dollars you can get a splitter that's shielded."
1,Terrible!!!!,"Do not waste your money on this book! I was very shocked when I opening the book and discovered there was very littleillustration. Also, the text was very hard to read. It literally is just a bunch of small text thrown together with no thought to organizing it in a readable manner. Incredibly sad for the price I paid for it!!! Very disappointed. I should have just looked up the information and printed it out from the web and crammed it in a binder. The publisher evidently didn't want to put any thought whatsoever into this publication!!"
5,wonderfully explainitory for the average person,"Ed Welch is so talented in writing so that all readers, whether expert or novice, can relate and understand what he's talking about. I read so that I could better understand the struggles of a loved one going through depression and it greatly deepened my understanding and ignited my compassion. Highly recommended for anyone suffering from depression or loving someone who does."
2,A little preachy,"I sincerely thought I would get a lot out of this book. As someone who has suffered from depression for the past 4 years, the initial chapter allowed me to feel understood, and I was anxious to read the rest of the book. What I did find helpful was the advice to attend church in a liturgical way, that is, to read prayers rather than trying to pray your own. In the chapters that follow, though, Welch starts calling depressed patients out on their sin: their anger, their disappointments. I had to discontinue reading around 2/3 of the way through because I honestly felt beat up by those chapters and like I was being blamed for my depression. It seems ""the church"" is always blaming victims for what they are suffering from and this book ended up being no different."
2,Threw It Away,The author did not connect with the truly depressed person who needs medical help. Didn't enjoy book at all. Threw it away.
1,Despite the presence of Rob Zander (and Enuff Znuff!) this is the worst of the three tribute LPs 2 best band in America(1987-76),"Surprisingly bad, especailly theworst song Cheap Trick ever did,Girlfiends! Just awful, actuallyI shouldn't exagerrate. It's notthat good. But it's still betterthan Tom Petersson and AnotherLanguage!"
3,Very Cut,I understand that these dvds are the short version of these telenovela but....they cut out alot of the great scenes from this telenovela. I watched this novela from begining to end on TV and when I saw this DVD I was disappointed with the results. So please keep in mind that when you order this DVD it is a very cut version.
1,i hate it,i was very disappointed with this product. it does not state that this is an edited version of the tele-novela. it's only about 14 hours long so they rush it a lot to get to the point. you miss out on a lot of moments that aren't worth missing.
3,So much is missing!!,"I love this novela. The packaging and everything is good, but they cut out so many scenes! If you have a favorite scene from this novela then chances are they aren't in the DVD! All of Milagros musical numbers are cut out! There's not one scene where she's singing or performing! All the musical numbers are gone. I think this product is good but it was disappointing to see so many things missing."
5,THE BEST NOVELA I'VE SEEN!,"If you want to get true intertainment, then get this. By far its one of the best telenovelas out there, and is DEFINETLY not borring. Awsome, just is."
3,Why mess with a good thing?!,I bought this DVD set for my little sister who feel in love with this novela. When we got it she poped it right it in. But right of the bat we realized that a lot of scenes were missing. I've watched this novela in full so I could tell that some important scenes had been cut. So viewing it is kinda hard because you go from one scenes to a completly different one with no clue what happend in the last one and no clue why your now in the middle of a completly diferrent conversation. Why cut those scenes out? To make it shorter? I have no clue why they messed with it. I rather pay more for one extra disc then for it to be choppy! But this novel all in all is great! Full of laughs and good times with a great plot! Just wished they would have kept it the same.
4,Comentario Sobre la Edicion en Dvd de Al Diablo Con Los Guapos,"Me Gusto Mucho la Historia Original de esta Novela, Muñeca Brava que años atras fue Protagonisada por Natalia Oreiro y Facundo Arana y aunque no he visto mucho de este Remake me dare la oportunidad de Comprar el Dvd para ver que tal esta.Me Gusta Mucho Allisson Lozz y Eugenio Siller, hacen una Bonita Pareja y actuan muy bien, creo que tienen mucha quimica. Por otra parte me tienta muchisimo la Idea de ver a Ariadne Diaz como Antagonista, a Tania Vazquez y a Michelle Vieth, creo que son Buenas Actrizes y por los Avances que estube mirando me gusto mucho y fue que me decidi a Comprarla.Espero no me desepcione, parece estar Muy Buena la Telenovela.Cuando tenga el Dvd y lo vea les cuento que tal me ha ido con la Experiencia...9/8/2011: Exelente Telenovela, Muy Bien Adaptada, Me Atrapo y esta Muy Bien Resumida, Contiene Las Mejores Escenas, Lo Mas Importante. Muy Recomendable el Dvd!!!"
3,okay,I love this novela so much this novela was one of the reasons i started to watch novelas. so i liked it so much that i had to buy it on DVD but it sucked on DVD...unlike how it was when it was showing on TV....they cut so many scenes and if you were to watch it for the first time u could be pretty lost
2,Disk 3 ???,I know this Telenovela and is super. But I am very sad because the 3 Disk is missing in the dvd Box.I hope that amazon.com sends mi the 3 Disk !?
4,Pretty Good!,It was pretty good. Was not butchered at all. The only thing that there were parts on the full version that Iwished to see on this. But you can't have it all.
2,Not what I expected,"From the looks of the photo I was expected a nice, well-formed/stuffed hand puppet. When it arrived though, the face was unfixably squished, which I think was an error in sewing, and it turned out the mouth is held together with a plastic frame that's just way too big for Bert's small head. And because of this frame it also makes it incredibly hard for an adult hand to use the puppet, let alone fit inside, and I imagine it would feel too bulky for a small child to use. Who exactly were they expecting to use this thing?"
4,Very nice puppet,"Looks really nice (resembles the original) and extremely durable.The only problem is it is a bit too stiff to operate (make it talk), mainly for a toddler."
3,Mixed Feelings,"It is hard to review anything by Nevada Barr, because her works contain, on one hand, passages of great beauty, as she describes various parts of our country. And then, there's the other hand:she tends to overdue many scenes of violence and pain. I find myself skipping over too many passages, because they sicken me."
4,4+ Stars for Anna Pidgeon and Murder,"Anna is trying to sort out her feeling for the local sheriff but Murder seems to keep getting in the way of her doing this.First there is the body that is found in the Old Plantation/National Park Site bedroom. This is not a run of the mill tourist it is a well known man of a local family, and trussed up to look like he did more than just die.Then there is the deer stand that Anna and her Deputy are trying to catch in use. Well Anna catches more than she barging for with this one.After a few harrowing disasters and learning a lot about the history of the area I just couldn't stop listening and was disappointed that it ended."
2,not up to par,"Of all the Anna Pigion books I have read, this is the worst. The charecters are shallow and stiff, the dialog stillted and meaningless, and the park is not well described and in no way seems like a place one would like to visit. This mystery seems to be a big ""so what"". Not nearly up to Ms Barr's best efforts."
3,Barr's Old Cars,"I really enjoy Nevada Barr's mystery novels, but after reading ""Hunting Season,"" I think it's time for the author to uproot her plucky ranger from the Natchez Trace. Anna seems to be vegetating there. Time for her to climb into her (33-year old+?) ""Rambler American"" (p. 146) and head for a National Park other than the Natchez Trace or, heaven forbid, bear-infested Glacier National Park. Maybe the loathsome Randy Thigpen can follow her off the Trace in ""a late model truck, possibly mid- to late-seventies"" (p. 189), accompanied by a fellow undesirable who works ""the night shift at Packard"" (p. 236). Is this book Ms. Barr's unpublished first novel revivified or what? If not, what's with all the antique cars? ""Crown Vic""s have been around forever, but her other ""Detroit irons"" are relics of an earlier era. What gives? as they used to say."
4,"REVIEW OF NEVADA BARR ""HUNTING SEASON""",IT WAS AN INTERESTING BOOK BUT A LITTLE SLOWER GETTING STARTED THAN SOME OF HER BOOKS. VERY GOOD AUTHOR. ENJOY HER BOOKS VERY MUCH.
4,Good_but not the best.,I enjoyed this book but it did not have the holding power of her latest book_The Rope. As usual a great escape from reality.
4,Good book!,I really enjoyed how Barr brings characters within the book to life. She really allows you to experience the culture as well.
4,Good entry in Anna Pigeon series,"I've read all the Anna Pigeon books and this is one of the best. As always, the author's knowledge of natural settings and creatures adds greatly to the enjoyment. The mystery is a good one, exploring more aspects of Anna's character, especially her vulnerability because of her small size and the fact that she is the ""boss"" and uneasy in her new position. The descriptions of the different reactions of other characters (co-workers, other law enforcers, townspeople and suspects) are excellent, exploring Mississippians using their present and past to explain their different reactions to situations.Anna's romance with Sheriff Paul Davidson, with its ups and downs, adds interest and humanity to Anna's character. Too bad there isn't more about sister Molly!Since reading ""Deep South"", I have visited the Natchez Trace Parkway. Both that book and this one evoke the area, its eerieness and its history very well."
4,Hunting Season by Nevada Barr review,"This is the 3rd Anna Pigeon mystery I have read, the others were first Deep South, the second Liberty Falling and now Hunting Season. I think her writing is very well done and her novels keep my interest from the beginning and I keep on going if I have the time. This plot is well done, kept me guessing until the very end. I am now reading Firestorm and plan to read each of her mysteries.Nevada Barr is great!"
2,Broken Barr,"Noting my own prickliness in reading this book, at first I thought it was my mood. It wasn't, it was the book itself. ... I've read all the other Anna Pigeon series and this book has to be the absolute worst. In some series, you can see the character's growth from book to book, but here we're seeing not growth but decline. And it's not pretty.... If I hadn't already bought it and read it, I wouldn't. Hopefully, Ms. Barr will take the bad reviews to heart and be inspired to write something far better for the next in the series."
3,Why do I keep reading this series?,"I do not find the lead character likeable. Ranger Pigeon has little sense of humor and typical left wing prejudices. One reviewer accurately charaterized this as her ""NPR soapbox"". Nevertheless I keep reading this series-I suppose due to Barr's story telling ability and my childhood love of our National Parks."
4,All About Anna,"I think you either like Anna or you don't. I can't say the plots are air tight. I can't say she's the most intuitive of detectives. I can say she's wonderful to spend time with -- and her insights and descriptions of very real people are, to use a well-worn word, palpable. She's focused, flawed, and fabulous (as a result). This plot is solid, the setting is well used, and the resolution is right there. Maybe not my favorite Nevada Barr, but still an enjoyable ride."
2,Anna Pigeon as a District Ranger?,"Maybe she is a better Law Enforcement Officer in other books, but frankly all I thought while reading this book is that she should get killed for her incompetence. She makes a big deal out of Thigpen's interviewing techniques, when it was quite obvious from the get go that Anna couldn't deduce her way out of a paper sack.I got the audio tape at the library and have been listening to it during rush hour traffic, and quite frankly I have fast-forwarded thru her ""pity-me"" musings and have caught myself almost yelling at the audio for Anna's inability to see clues right in front of her eyes."
1,Disappointed!,"I have read most of Nevada Barr's previous books even though I am not usually a mystery reader. Her previous appeal for me was learning about the National Parks as the mystery solving occurred in them. After reading this book I don't have a feel at all for the Natchez Trace. While reading the book, I didn't really care about the characters. Mainly the book seemed to be about poor Anna. I echo the other reviewers in saying read Nevada Barr's other books and skip this one."
4,Anna Pigeon,I've read all of Navada Barr's works and will buy anything she writes. They are fast and easy reads. Makes me feel like I'm right there in the place she is writting about. Sometimes she get's a little over the top but that doesn't stop me from reading her. Right now reading IS my vacation. Now really what's better then a beautiful place and mystery.
1,Out of date,"The book covers Italian grammar adequately, but it is several decades old and is out of date for the way Italian is spoken today. Even the print is old-fashioned and a little hard to read, particularly for older people whose eyes need a cleaner type-face."
3,Not for beginners,"Though it doesn't say it in the description, this book is not intended for beginners to the Italian language. It DOES say that once you get the book.For what it does, and the price, the book is good. But I would suggest you go through the Pimsleur or Rosetta Stone series before going through this, or you might find yourself rather confused. Good luck!"
3,",","Sorry to break the chain, but many important grammar topics are either omitted or covered superficially."
2,A little disappointing,"As a military spouse and after reading so many great reviews here and elsewhere, I felt the need to read this book. It was a little fluffy for my liking. I did relate to events and day to day life of the women. However, I felt as though a lot was missing from this book. I was left wanting to know more about the characters. I think it could have been developed a little more."
