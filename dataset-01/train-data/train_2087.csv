3,Good with one problem,"Product is as described. One issue is that there is no drainage on the bottom so if you leave the top off and it rains, your only option is to completed empty it out so the water can drain. Creates a bit of a mess. Otherwise, it's a good size and holds a lot of sand. Can try to cut a hole in it yourself, we may do that with the one we bought."
5,A Sandbox That My Husband Doesn't Think Is An Eyesore!,"I really wanted to get our one and half year old son a sandbox. My husband was refusing to because he said he'd make one for him (like when is he going to get around to doing that?) because he didn't want one more brightly colored plastic item in our rather small yard. Thankfully, Step 2 came out with this sandbox this year and I convinced my husband to let me buy it. I have to say he is pleasantly surprised at how nicely it compliments our landscaping and it sticks out in a ""nice"" way. Oh and yes, our son loves to play in it. The four seats are a nice addition and the rectangular shape makes it seem bigger than the square and round ones. Kudos to Step 2!"
5,Still in great condition after 5 years!,"My 8 year old son received this sandbox for his 3rd birthday. It's still in great condition. We were good about keeping the lid on so rain and unwanted animals never got in. He has outgrown playing in the sand so we punched a few holes in the bottom, filled it with potting soil, and now we use it as a garden box!"
5,"Excellent sandbox, tons of fun for kids!","Never regretted purchasing Naturally playful sandbox. It's durable, not expensive, it was delivered the very next day and kids just LOVE it! It has enough space for 2-3 kids to play in. The cover keeps away pets and rain."
4,18 months of use and seasons and still going strong,my kids love this sand box and i like that i can cover it from area cats at night. blends into my landscape perfectly. i has stood up to summers of direct unshaded sunlight and cold winter snows with high winds.. the cover stays on .
4,Satisfied,My 3yr old son loves it. Perfect size for him and a few friends. I love that it has a lid to protect against weather and animals. It was worth the price.
4,Good read,"Good read. Her reluctance to tell the truth goes on a bit more than I would have thought but overall, not bad."
2,AVID BOOK READER,"I DON'T WHY THIS WAS GIVEN THOSE AMOUNT OF STARS. UNLESS IT WAS FOR THE STORYLINE ONLY. A PITY BECAUSE THE SO CALLED HERO RICHARD DUQUESNE IS SUCH A RAT. THIS IS A HERO? THIS IS HOW A VILLIAN ACTS NOT A HERO. HE MEANCES HER, EMMY IS QUITE AFRAID OF HIM. THE WAY HE BEHAVES, WHY EVEN THEN WOULD GET HIM ARRESTED. HE IS LIKE THIS THROUGH MOST OF THE BOOK. NEAR THE END HE SAYS HE FIRST SAW HER A A INN, THIS TAKING PLACE BEFORE THE STORY, AND TELLS HER HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AT FIRST SIGHT. WELL HE HAS A REALLY SICK WAY OF SHOWING HER. A REAL HERO IS GARETH ST. CLAIR'S IN IT'S IN HIS KISS. THE WAY HE TREATS HYACINTH BRIDGERTON IS 100% DIFFERENT. HE WOULD AND DOES NOT TREAT HAYCINTH THE WAY RICHARD DOES EMMA. SO WHILE THE STORY LINE IS WORTH 5 STARS, RICHARD 'S BEHAVIOR RUINS IT, THUS IT GETS TWO STARS."
1,"Despite low price, still a waste of money","I agree with the previous post. I probably shouldn't have expected much for $5, but within 20 minutes of removing from the package (and before making it to the pool!) my 3 year old brought one of the rings to me and a huge piece had broken off of it - leaving an extremely dangerous pointy shard of plastic. Not what I was expecting at all."
3,alright,"bright, colorful, fun. Little too typsy for my 3 yr old. dont like how it all ""rolls"" away when it tips...which is alot for us. do more picking up then playing, but it is exciting for her and she likes it."
4,Entertaining!,"The opposite idea of Jenga, you add as many pieces as you can without tipping it over. Teaches about balance, volume and shape. Very durable and feels nice, made of wood."
5,Fun for the Family!,Very well made. Completely wooden clown & pieces. Multi colored. Very easy to play and lots of fun for the kids. This is a toddler game and my four year old enjoys it.
5,Good toy for any age,"I bought it for my 3.5 old daughter, but the first person who played with it was her 18 years old sister. They both had a lot of fun. I highly recommend this toy."
5,outstanding!,This product is so educationa and can be used for a variety of intents. I am a general and special educator as well as speech therapist and I use this toy to target a variety of educational objectives. Wonderful quality and durable. My students love it!
3,Not nearly as bad as some other reviews here suggest,"While obviously no Lord of the Rings, this is still a decent fantasy flick for the kiddos, made with care and craft. I don't know the source books so I can say from an objective viewpoint (whatever that is) that the script is about what you'd expect, as is the story, and so on; sorry, I'm not enough of a fanboy to be thoroughly offended by this movie's digressions from the Sacred Text.Coming in with no preconceptions, we were entertained, if not wildly, and have no regrets about watching this movie. A little visual enhancement went a long way. Open your mind and deal with this film on its own level, like the 10 year-old you once were (or still are, judging from some reviews here). There's some fun to be had here."
1,Unthrilling,This movie was poorly written to say the least. The only movie I have ever actually walked out of in the theaters. It was painfully cliche and overproduced.
4,Not that bad!!,"I do not understand where all of the one star reviews are coming from. It was not that bad!!! I have not read the book, and that allowed me to view the movie with no preconcieved notions. I thought the effects were great. The story was pretty cool as well with the connection between the dragon and rider. This movie made me want to read the books. I have seen one star movies, and I am telling you, this is not one of them. It is absolutly not fair to rate this movie one star. If you want a one star movie, check out Zombie Nation. LOL"
2,ehm..,"thank GOD i haven't read the book, guess the movie would seem even worse.it's sucky enough as it is.plot makes no sense. well, not that i have read the sporlight review, it's clear why. so many things are missing, it makes no sense to the ""uninitiated"" (those of us who haven't read the book, namely, cuz we can't patch up the gaps in story with knowledge from the book). you watch the movie and you wonder why people do what they do, how did this or that come to happen.. i hate it when i don't understand the whys and hows, the script HAS to make sense in order for me to enjoy the film.besides that, the whole thing reminded me so BADLY of a bootleg version of LOTR it was UNBELIEVABLE. the princess, the monsters, the fortress..dunno. kinda sucky. LOTR's maimed and disfigured lil brother."
1,"Yeah, sure, just go ahead and ruin a GREAT book.","THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE THE BOOK!!! o.k, i'll admit it. they followed the basic storyline, but they took away almost 40% of the material!!! If you DIDN'T read the book, skip this review and go enjoy the movie. IF YOU DID.....CRITICS:1. Saphira, in two minutes, gets turned into a grown dragon, and announces: ""I am Saphira, and I've been waiting for you.""2. Angela!!! Solembum!! completely eliminated!!! well, actualy, Angela appears in Thereinsford, as some solemn, beutiful fortune teller. But Solembum? Gone!!3. REALLY!! they eliminated TEIRM, WHEN ERAGON WAS CAPTURED, JEOD, LEONA, THE BABY THAT ERAGON BLEST, ALL BUT THE ANCIENT LANGUAGE, THE TWINS, AND ISIDAR MITHRIM!!!4. they all but forgot murtagh, and the kull, and the razaac turned into mummies.5. you can almost TELL that they only made this movie for monie! Murtaug is PUNY! ERAGON doesn't even get a scar!!CREDITS:good acting. cool costumes. neat Thereinsford scene."
4,Good Movie. Good AV quality,"I liked the movie, but I agree with others that say it could be better. One would expect a little more action in a title like this. Not my favorite, but still good enough to buy and watch more than once."
4,"""eragon"" Two Disc Special Edition","Fascinating documentary on the making of the movie and fantastic special effects. If you've read the books you wont be disappointed, a must see for any fantasy buff."
4,good but not too good,"The movie was ok and I understand th eneed to deviate from the original book but somethings were just off the wall.The graffics in some parts were a little substandard IMO, and the crew of the movie could have done a little better quailty work in general. Acting was a little weak in a couple spots as well.For the most part it was a good movie, but there are some areas that kind of spoiled it for me."
1,What Story Was I Supposedly Watching,"I know the book was derviative -- but this movie was worse than bad. The other comments are true. If you read the book, you understood the characters but if not, you had a movie with no rhyme or reason, no one to have any connection to -- nothing. Dont waste your money. Nothing followed the book other than boy finds dragon and there is a war -- that's it. Waste of time"
1,Not a good movie,"I had high expectations after reading the book. Far too many important concepts and ideas were left out of the movie which made for a lack of empathy for certain characters. The flat out lack of characterization destroyed the quality of viewing for the movie.After 10 minutes i had already realized i would be dissapointed and tried to watch the film without relating it to the book. It was far to obvious though that there was major editing done that cut out sections of storyline. There were times i thought ""hey, how did the characters get to this point from nowhere?"" and there were scenes in the movie that merely wasted time. If they got rid of some of the pointless special effects and put in the simple important concepts then this could have been fantastic.The acting was just plain horrid though. I consider myself lucky i did not pay the outrageous prices of a theatre to view the movie with friends."
1,There is only one reason I'm getting this movie,"The only reason I'm getting this movie is to see what mountainous plot points they cut out. I understand that films must be edited but I was so dissapointed with this movie. They couldn't follow this book if they wanted to. The acting and scenery were the only good things that saved this movie from being total crap. If it had gotten nominated for an Oscar, it would only have proved that the other nominees had to be bad. Half of the story line and 2/3 of the characters have been sucked out of this 2 hour peice of trash. I can honestly tell you that they won't make Eldest because they didn't introduce Katrina and the Twins in this movie. Jeod is not even in here and the Razaac are stuntmen covered in bugs. It was really pathetic, don't waste your time."
2,Nothing like the book,"Although this movie is based loosely on the book, the hour and a half it runs for gives no time to explore all of the nuances of the book's extraordinary adventure. I loved the book, which was well written and thought out, but the movie has basically butchered Christopher Paolini's great fantasy novel.To do a movie like this, the time frame needs to be similar to Lord of the Rings. Another hour or so, and this could have been a good movie. The only reason I gave this two stars is for the dragon and Jeremy Irons.Rent if you still want to see it, don't buy!"
3,Eragon,The graphics in the movie were great. I read the book first and was disapointed in the movie but it could have been done worse. It did make a nice family movie for my young teens. The actors did a great job in the roles given to them. I feel alot was left out. But am still glad I bought the DVD.
2,What Book Was This Based On???,"Perhaps I would have liked the movie more, if I had not read the books (Eragon & Eldest) - but this movie is hardly representative of the book itself. I realize that some movies take liberties with the story in the book for time and complexity considerationsA, but this movie is such a dramatic departure from the book that save the foundation story, and characters, it's hardly representative of the book that Paoliini wrote.If you just want an entertaining, clean, fantasy film this will work. If you want to see a movie based on the book Eragon, the n I suggest you skip this movie and wait until someone else makes one that's better. If you're trying to decide between watching the movie and reading the book, then definitely read the book instead.."
1,simply put-boring,"This movie is the most boring movie ever. After reading the book, I had pretty high expectations. After watching this movie, I never wanted to pick up the book again. In this movie, the phrase ""true to the book"" does not exist whatsoever. If you enjoyed this book, and have yet to see this movie but are planning to, cancel your plans and go do something else."
3,Not Bad,"I liked this action adventure featuring several dragon scenes. If you like sci fi fantasy, this is pretty good. I would recommend it. Based on the novel."
1,Should have known better,"After reading the book, I should have made the educated guess that this movie wouldn't be that good. It's hard to believe, but the movie is actually worse than the book. While that is the case for most movies, one would think you couldn't go much worse with this movie. The story has great potential, so I was hoping that the author's youth could be made up for with someone else writing the script. This was not the case. Save yourself some money and time and don't buy, rent, borrow or whatever this movie (or the book). There are plenty of other great fantasy movies out there that will better occupy ones time."
4,"Great visual effects, shallow character development","I'm a dragon fan and I really liked this movie when I watched it on the big screen; the dragon is awesome and the story was good, although a bit predictable. Several people who have already read the story in print have told me that the book delves deeper into the characters' lives and now I want to read it to get the whole story. It has been my experience that most books are always greater than the movie (let's be realistic, we wouldn't want to sit to a 10- or 12-hour movie, would we?). I'm also glad to see that this book has done what the Harry Potter books have done, which is get younger people to read books again instead of wasting time watching TV or playing video games."
4,Not that bad,"I am an avid fan of the books. I've read Eragon 3 times and Eldest twice. The movie, I will admit, was a disappointment. But as far as movies go, it was still good. You can't expect it to be just like the books. We'd all be in there for days if it were. But the special effects were phenomenal, ecspecially Saphira. And all the roles were well cast. With this file, don't judge a movie by the bad reviews. Give it a chance. My family loved it and they'd never read the books."
4,Great movie (havn't read the book yet),"I thought it was a great movie. It isn't as deep as say LOTR etc but I enjoyed it very much, however I had not read the books so I am guessing that has a huge impact on my liking it :)So if you have not read the books, I think the movie is wonderful. I love the dragon, love her voice and how they made her look."
4,Great Movie,"I never read the book, though I do plan to read it. Regardless, I don't see a movie expecting it to be just like the book, and I never read a book and expect it to be just like the movie. To me, that would be boring. Having seen this movie, and thought it was great, I am now excited to read the book to see what was left out. Only thing keeping this from being a 5-star rating is that, for an epic film, it was short, but since the book was geared towards a younger audience, and the movie is geared toward a young audience, I can't fathom a child sitting still for 3 to 3 and a half hours without losing focus."
1,order of things,"if you already read the book, do yourself a favor and never watch the movie, it will hurt to see such a great book being torn apart. if you have not read it, watch the movie, and then run and buy the book to enjoy the ""How did they not show that...?"" feeling."
1,Why did they even release this movie!,"Having read both ""Eragon"" and ""Eldest"", I was expecting this movie to be in the line of a ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. What an injustice to the book and the story of Eragon and Saphira! So much was unexplained, left un-attended too, or completely skipped. All of the characters were completely undeveloped. I could completely careless about any of them - even the main characters! I could barely sit to finish the movie! What a grave injustice to Mr. Paolini's work! I will continue to read the books, but I will completely skip any other movie that is made in relation to them. Hopefully 20 years from now someone like a Peter Jackson (Director of Lord of the Rings movies) will come along and remake the movie as it should have been made the first time around!"
2,On What Novel Was This Based??,"I understand that there is no such thing as a perfect book-to-silver-screen adaptation, but the director and screenwriters could have at least let the plot be the plot. The Potter films have been incredibly successful at leaving out certain elements while keeping the basic story the same. The filmmakers in the case of Eragon simply decided to write their own story and use the character names from the book. Further, they wrote a bad story with a bad script and bad actors, with the exception of Jeremy Irons. Irons is certainly in his element as the grizzled, creepy, old war hero and is the only redeeming quality to the movie. It is a shame because the book had so much big screen potential. I almost wish the production company would scrap any plans for a sequel, wait several years, and then restart with better personnel. However, they might have to put Jeremy Irons in cryogenic storage so that he can reprise his role"
1,Agreeing with most other reviews ....,"While my hat is off to Paolini for writing 3 books at such a young age, Eragon did read like ""Lord of the Rings Lite,"" with a touch of ""Star Wars"" ... something other reviewers have commented on.The book was basic. This movie butchered it. They had a fairly strong cast ... and did nothing with it.I'd suggest skipping this one."
3,"Please, no Eldest, there is already ""Krull"", or ""Dragonslayer"", or ""Willow"", or AD&D, or ....","A split decision.""I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering.""""Go away! And stay away!"" ""Outcasts. Rebels."" ""One false move, one reckless decision""""Take care of Saphira. Without her. You'll find that life is hardly worth living.""Come on. Who wrote this, George Lucas? Where's my +3 buckler shield to defend me from this? Let me dig out my 12-sided dragon dice and roll to defend myself.In all seriousness though, my seven year son loved the movie. He has not been around the block enough times to have a problem with the movie's profound lack of originality. I would have not been surprised to have a Wookie poke its head through the trees and I would have cheered if I saw Xena's chakram fly threw the air bouncing off of every knuckle-headed cliche and generally mixing things up. Alas, it seems not to be.One star for me, five from my son. 6 stars in total 2 people = 3 stars."
1,Why was this made?,"I read the book for this a few months ago. Even though it wasn't the greatest book, it did have a lot of good parts to it. Unfortunately, all of the best parts of the book were removed from the film, and replaced with mediocre parts, at best.In the book, there were Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, and a bit of magic. I the movie, there were no Elves, no Dwarves, the Dragon was a flying chicken (i.e. feathers, instead of scales), and the magic was lost.The acting in the movie was poor, and the plot was rather thin. You didn't get a chance to feel for any of the characters, since there was very little in character development.All in all, there isn't really anything that can be done to redeem this movie."
3,Good but a little disapointing,"Ok first off I will say this was a good movie I will definitely get it when it comes out on DVD. But compared to the book it was a little disappointing. There are things in the book that don't even take place in the movie and visa versa for the movie having things that weren't even in the book, as for Saphira in the book it takes months for her to fully grow and the mental link between her and Eragon to form but it just took like a day in the movie. No sooner does she start to fly than bam bam bam she is fully grown and can speak with Eragon. If they had made the movie a little bit longer it could have possibly been better but as it stands it is still a good movie just a little disappointing compared to the book."
1,Terribly disappointing!,"I loved these books, but 5 minutes into this movie I wanted to walk out of the theaters. The story was changed so much that it was basically LOTR. Save your time and your money, if you have to see it what for it to come out on cable."
1,Horrible Movie,"The novel-and now movie- was a piece of junk, and the movie sucks as well; it was basically Star Wars in Middle Earth. Boy(aka Luke Skywalker), with a dreams of being someone(Jedi), becomes the last of a breed of Dragon Riders(aka Jedi). He becomes under the teaching of a former Dragon Rider, Brom (aka Obi Won Kenobi). As he trains and outta nowhere learns magic, he finds out of a trapped princess(aka Leia). Disregarding his mentor, he goes to save her and in the process, one of the evil kings henchmen(aka Darth Vader) kills Brom. He goes for a final battle at the end. Sound all too familiar?? With lack of depth and originality and realism, this bogus fantasy disgraces the name of fantasy and the book or the movie shouldn't exist."
4,Nice Visual,"the video is nice but as with any movie it does not always depict the book's total essence. Nice try. However, my purchase was great and the video was in awesome shape. would buy form this seller again."
4,Eragon,The movie had something for everyone. There was the touching bond between Dragon and Rider yet there was plenty of action to keep it fun. There was even Magic to keep you guessing and a happy yet undefined ending leaving room for a sequel.
3,A good movie from a great book!,"The movie Eragon was a good movie. There were a lot of good things about the movie. One of the things that is great about the movie is the special effects. The movie also had a great story line. The mane reason I like the movie is because it was different from any other movie I've seen. It is also fast paced with a lot of fights and action.There were also a lot of bad things in the movie. One of the bad things is that the movie skipped around a lot. Another thing is that the movie was too short so it cut out a lot of the book. They also changed a lot of things from the book. Like they made Brom, Eragon's friend burn down his house not the Ra'zac. And they made the shade ride a dragon.The movie Eragon could have been better if it was longer. Like they didn't show how or when Eragon learn the magic. Or if it didn't skip around as much. If it were more like the book it would have been better. If you want to see a good movie with a lot of action watch Eragon."
1,"Too violent for our kids, too boring for the grown-ups",A disappointing mess that was trying too hard to match the Lord of the Rings in fight scenes and offered little in the way of inventive plots or diverting characters. And who thought it would be cool to see dragons fly around with the speed of fighter jets? Blah.
1,Boring!!,"I almost bought this movie when it came out before seeing it and I am glad I didn't buy the movie. We rented it and my 9 year old son is the only one who liked the movie. I felt that there was alot cut out of the movie. Didn't enjoy it. The kid that played Eregon got on my nerves, I didn't think he fit the part. Just very boring. I did think the senery was gorgeous though, so I guess that was one plus for the movie."
1,Puerile,"So, the first part is Star Wars redone medieval style. All the character and plot elements are plagiarized to a T, including Uncle Owen (no Aunt Beru), Obi-Wan, the Princess, Han Solo, etc. The second half is some LOTR, with elves, orcs, Saruman, etc. Pathetic.The dragon graphics are OK. The main character has an interesting look to him. The script is not very good. Some OK costume design - Eragon gets some nice clothes.Strictly for the kids."
1,It was mediocre; didn't follow the book; don't buy it; contains spoiler,"I read the book, and I highly recommend the book. I watched the movie, expecting it to follow it. It didn't. I was sorely disappointed with the movie. Don't buy it.********SPOILER*********It does well with unimportant pieces like how he found the egg, and Brom's story-telling. Those are kind of important, but not key points to the story. Brom and Eragon didn't go to any of the populated towns; they went from Carvahal to the dead town where Eragon found his magic, then they hiked across the forest line to the jail area and Eragon fought the urgals and Brom was mad and then they freed the elf and then they traveled a bit more and they found Murtag and Brom died and they traveled to the mountain and then they were barely accepted then there was the war and that's basically the entire movie"
1,it was nothing like the book,You do not get an impression of the book from the movie. The book is way better.
2,The book is obviously better,"The movie is entertaining enough, but nowhere near as good as the book, which is to be expected."
3,book vs. movie,"This would be a fine movie if I had never read the book. The movie took away some of the most important elements and details of the book (such as Arya not even being an elf in the movie, and the obvious lack of dwarves.) An Eragon movie created in the style of the book series has so much potential that was lost in this cinematic effort.In defense of the movie, my husband and son loved it because they had never read the original story. (They have both recently listened to Eragon on Cd and now refuse to watch the movie ever again.)In summary, read the book or watch the movie. Don't do both!"
3,Not bad,I was hoping to watch an Eragon movie that was close to the book. I'm hoping a second movie about the second book will be out in the future.
1,Upset,"This book was a great book. I read the book after I saw the movie. Now I hate the movie. They didn't seem to get the characters right. Murtagh is my favorite character, even though they stuck to the book with him it seemed ike they didn't follow his character traits. He was in the book a lot more than they showed in the movie. Arya was another one of the important characters and they didn't even follow her right. Not to mention Brom's death. I found myself disappointed when they didn't follow the book with his death. Not to mention all of the things they didn't cover that they should have! Where Eragon got Saphira's name, and where Eragon's name came from. I can expect some changes in movie's that they didn't follow in the book, but that much? I think they should have gotten a better director for the movie who would follow the book. I would not recomend the movie to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact I wouldn't even recomend the movie. It was a waste of money, and time."
1,A REAL RIPOFF,This review is not for the Actual movie. It desires 4-5 stars. The one star is for the extended version of the movie... It is ONE WHOLE MINUTE than the standard version. That is not an extended version.
2,waste of time,"If you have never read the book, then this is a pretty good movie. But, having read the book, I was sooo disappointed!! Nothing they did was hardly accurate. And they killed off the Ra'zac...and by doing that, there is no way that they could make a second movie if they wanted to because the Ra'zac are part of the second book! This was a waste of movie for me.."
1,my top 10 worst movies list.,"I even rated ""Snakes on the Plane"" better than this one. Graphics were simi ok, but whom ever directed this, doesn't need to touch another movie again. Seriously."
2,Fall short of the book..... REAL short,"Anytime a movie is made from a book, the producers ""trim the fat"" to make the film more appealing to the audience. Eragon takes this to a whole new level. The mysticism of being a dragonrider is removed. The hardships of the journey across the land are removed. The politics of the book... gone! Also a good majority of the plot is stricken from the record. This film could have easily been as epic as Lord of the Rings. But apparently the director/producers wanted a film empty of plot and full of special effects. I think that a casual movie goer may enjoy this film a bit, but any fan of the book will be sorely disappointed."
5,This movie has prompted me to read the books,"Our family really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was very well done without all the ""trash"" and foul language you come to expect in movies today.I am sure from reading the other reviews that I might personally find the movie somewhat lacking AFTER I've read the book, just as I did with BOURNE SUPREMACY & THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. Nontheless, it WILL be a keeper in our DVD collection-for the dragon Saphira has captured my youngest's son's imagination!"
1,crapagon,Man this movie sucks. The acting is bad. The heroes are boring and undeveloped. It seems like a directing class school project. Watch it on cable but dont clutter up your dvd collection with this garbage.
3,???,The book was okay but you could tell it was from a 16 year old. The movie was weird with good special effects only saving it from destrction. Acting was bad. Story was out of there. It was not a good film
3,"Broad, wide vision --","-- just not very deep. So let's start with the parts that work. The computer graphics are beautiful, as we've come to expect. The adventure story is classic: the evil tyrant, the secret cabal of rebels just waiting to strike for freedom, the young hero-to-be, unknown even to himself. Dragons are cool, especially when they're done as well as they are here. The castworks pretty well, too, with Jeremy Irons as the mysterious mentor and Sienna Guillory as the magical princess in need of rescue. Her slight resemblance to Tilda Swinton is a minor but enjoyable benefit to the role.The story, written by a 15 year old prodigy, has plenty of excitement - but that's about it. Characters tend toward the one-dimensional, and a few strands in the story seem not so tightly wound with the others. Set your expectations accordingly. The ""Eragon"" movie is big and beautiful, it's exciting and kid-safe, and that's enough.//wiredweird"
3,Better than the book.,"I saw the movie before reading the book, but having read it, I like the movie better. The book goes on forever, and I don't really recall Eragon doing anything during the finale except getting knocked unconcious. At least in the movie he does something. As far as movie adaptations go, I think the filmmakers did a good job. The visual effects, music, and acting are great. Ed Speelers brings Eragon to life."
3,Desapointment,"I'm very... VERY dessappointment, about the fact that it's more than a month since a brought the movie and i'm still waiting for it"
1,what could have been.,"he said he wrote his books so they could be movies. well i have never seen a good book get butcherd more than this, it's hard to put into words how bad this movie has re-ritten the entire story. i think the only things that were simular were the chericter names because what they did wasn't even simular to the book. save your money and buy anything else."
1,Ugh!,"I just saw the last five minutes of Eragon on TV and was instantly reminded of why I shut the DVD off after 5 minutes into the movie. The casting was terrible, the movie script was horrible and the acting was wooden. Christopher Paolini should have waited for a better funded offer before he sold the movie rights. Hopefully this is one movie they'll redo. It's a great book that deserves a much better movie."
2,Not good,"This movie was so disappointing and I was shocked that so much of the story was either changed or just left out. The raz-ak monsters were killed inside Helgrind; not the forest. There was so many facts changed I'm surprised permission was given to make this movie. The books are awesome. A LONG miniseries would be appropriate or at least 4 three hour long movies to include the MANY interesting and beautiful details of the books would have better captured the great story of Eragon. The Urgals in the movie looked like dirty, greasy body builders with crooked teeth. No horns, no monster-like appearance described in the book. Roran just walked off in the movie and he was a huge part of the actual story. Sorry, but do not waste your time with the movie."
1,Don't judge the book based on this horrible movie!,"My husband said it all with these words: ""If we had bought this movie, I'd throw it in the trash right now."" We are fans of the book. This movie slaughters it.It's like the writers/producer/director took all of the elements of the book, dropped them in a hat, and randomly pulled them out to make the movie. At the end of the movie, not all of the pieces are there, and they're completely out of order. This is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. The worst part is it is left open at the end for a sequel--that would be a travesty.One review suggested that they scrap this movie and start over. That's the only way to do it. Some may say that the book is too complex to translate into a movie, but it can be done--look at Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. I say that if you can't do the book justice, just leave it alone."
1,I hated this movie,"I never read the book, but I hated the movie. The acting was weak, the dialog was elementary and the plot was unremarkable. Let's hope they don't make a sequel. The final straw was the Avril Lavigne song over the end credits."
4,Much better than the book,"I read and liked the books okay but they weren't edited enough and become boring and the ending of Eragon was disappointing and rather anticlamatic to me. So I wasn't expecting much from the movie and was pleasantly surprised. It is rather short and I do see why people complain about the changes, but had I not read the book I would have liked the movie even more. It is full of action and was entertaining and the ending was much more exciting than the book. If you have read the book and loved it don't expect this movie to follow the story faithfully, but if you enjoy sci fi movies forget the book and enjoy the movie for itself."
1,Disapointing,I loved the book. When I saw the movie I felt like crying. The effects for the dragon was the only plus. Some parts were so badly made that I started laughing. My advice is if you loved the book dont see the movie because you will only be disapointed.
1,Completely botched the book,"This is the first time that I can ever remember that I walked out of the theatre angry. I had loved the book and found that the movie completely botched the story. The producers added things that were rediculous and removed characters and scenes that are vital for the book. I know that they were just trying to make it more view friendly (such as adding the love interest between Arya and Eragon) but the book sold well without this and I felt that it drastically diminished Arya's character. Even if I had not read the book, I would still be disappointed with this movie. A lot of questions are not answered and the flow was very poor."
2,The Disney Touch Destroyed the Movie.,"Somehow the producers made out of a great book just another Disney movie. They somehow intelligently integrated the long story into a short movie but it ended up to be very superficial with a lot of unnatural Schmalz. The acting feels often very unnatural, actually most of the time."
2,WHAT HAPPENED!!!,"I loved the book, but the movie was a HUGE letdown,it was like the movie makers said ""The book was great so we are going to make something completely different"",they didn't stick to the book at all here are a few examples,Saphira made her transformation into an adult dragon in a few minutes,they could have made the movie better by making it longer so they wouldn't have to cram so much into such a short amount of time,like the 4 minute ""great"" final battle.They left out some characters,Jeod,Angela,and Jormundur.The only part of this movie that I liked was the terrific acting by Jeremy Irons as Brom,he was even better in this movie than he was in Lion King."
3,Oh My,"First of all the movie leaves out abounch of things like the twins, Arya having black hair not blonde, that the Ra'zac aren't mummmy type monsters , and in the book Eragon was following the Ra'zac first he had no entanchen of going to the Varden. Secound the script is very bad, it leaves out him and Brom traveling to Teirm. I just want to say Eragon fans don't give your hopes up for this movie. It should have been rated pg-13 if harry potter 4 wwas."
2,Derivative,"It seems that every plot element from Star Wars is in this movie. Farm boy (Eragon, Luke) finds something (egg, droids) that somebody powerful wants (King, Emperor). The search is done by a powerful second-in-command (Durza, Darth Vader). The farm boy's uncle is killed. A older mentor shows up (Brom, Ben Kenobi), who teaches the boy about (magic, the force). There's even a princess and a rebel base waiting for a final attack. Continue this with the rest of the plot and you will see that this story mirrors Star Wars. Amazing that this kind of derivative book/movie made it past any respectable publisher/producer. My eight-year-old son even delighted in finding the similarities to Star Wars. Don't bother with this. Watch (or read) something original."
5,ya'll are so wrong! this is a great movie!!,"i had never seen this movie before today - HBO showed it once this morning and again in the evening and i watched it both times!! then i came straight here to amazon to add it to my wish list so that i could order it with my next batch of dvd's. it was a very good story,easy to follow and it had me hooked from the beginning! i did not want to miss a second of it. i hope HBO will show it several more times - until i get my own dvd that is."
2,Lacking,"Oh for all that is holy, when this comes out on DVD, please let it be an extended version. For what was shown, despite all the visuals and elements, was pathetic in terms of plot and character development. They NEEDED to spend another hour of the movie telling us more about the characters and world. It just felt like it lacked a whole of bunch."
1,"Could have been a great movie...keyword, COULD","I bought this book, read it, and enjoyed it. Of course it's not 100% original, but it was good. Then I heard that they were making a film adaptation of the book. I was not worried, ""if a teenager can write a book this good then just wait till the professionals get a hold of it."" Boy was I wrong, more like ""look how the pros ruin a teens perfectly good novel"". That said, the portions of the book that were in the movie were fairly good and I enjoyed them - however a 1 1/2 hour movie just does not cover a novel of this length. It would have been very easy to make this into a 2 - 2 1/2 hour movie, I know I would have watched it. It is very unfortunate that this film adaptation was ruined simply because everything was kicked into hyperdrive and no one had time to enjoy the movie."
1,"horrible, horrible movie","If you loved the book, don't buy the movie. It sucks. It is nothing more than a waste of your time. You would be better off banging your head against a wall for an hour and a half, although if you watch it you may want to do that anyways. There are way better movies to spend your money on, if you like dragon movies get Dragonheart instead. This movie was just pathetic."
1,Why?,"I was so totally excited when the movie came out, but I was bitterly disappointed.- They totally messed up the plot line.- What's with those stupid leather pants?- Whatever happened to Murtagh's character? It was so much more complex than that.- Dragons do not go from being a baby to full grown in like, five seconds.- What about Roran and Katrina?- Tronjeim was disappointing.- What happened to Orik?- Everybody's hair color was wrong.- The only thing I liked was maybe their choice of Durza and Galbatorix. That's it."
3,Not as Good as the Book,"This movie is ok, I guess. The book of this is WAY better than this. This movie took out alot of parts from the book and it seems like they rushed everything. I wasn't that impressed, but check it out, it's still pretty good and entertaining. But read the book first, it's awesome!"
3,Not as terrible as everyone says...,"I was very discouraged reading the reviews of this movie, but I went out and bought it anyway - I have the book and love it, I wanted to own the movie for my collection as well. I was skeptical about the casting, but after watching the movie I think the actors did well in their parts. My biggest issue was the length of the movie - 103 minutes? Not nearly enough time! They could've made it a 2 hour and 20 minute movie (like LoTR or some of the HP movies) and had nearly 40 more minutes to flesh out the characters and story. The movie was good, but too short - I think people will agree with that whether they've read the book or not. The computer animated Saphira was gorgeous, though."
4,It depends upon your expectations ...,"Not having read the book, I went into the theater not knowing what to expect from Eragon, although the trailer did have me intrigued & was the very thing that convinced me that I needed to see this movie ...So, it was from that perspective (no preconceived notions) that I sat down to watch Eragon & ended up thoroughly enjoying it. Looking back, I can see the similarities with the Star Wars plot (& just about every other hero/heroine fantasy ever made), but that didn't mar my enjoyment one bit.If you're just looking for a straight-forward fantasy movie with some great special effects, then this movie is the one.If, on the other hand, you are a ""true fan"" looking for an accurate portrayal of the author's original vision, then you will probably be disappointed, because there is NO WAY Hollywood can make a movie that is true to each & every fan's inner imagination/mental picture -- THAT would be impossible."
1,You B@stards!!,"How anyone could sleep at night after ruining such an incredible story is beyond me. This is just another money making scheme hugging on the coattails of something great. If you haven't read the book I don't know that you could follow such a jumbled story with gaping holes and no character development, and if you read the book chances are you wanted to cry after seening this film as I did. Shame on you Fangmeier. READ THE BOOKS, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,This movie was completely awful,This movie was nothing compared to the book. It sped through things way to fast and allowed abosolutley no time for character development I gave this movie one star because I thought that it was an awaful movie and would not recomend this movie to anyone.
3,Okay.......Nothing Extraordinary,"I read both of the books in the trilogy, and they were the best fantasy books I've ever read, next to Inkheart! So I was obviously excited when the advertisement for the film came out. I saw it with my father, and I liked it...but it was nothing like the book. AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!Sure, Ed Speleers is cute, but I think he needs to go to a better acting school. The sound effects and story were great, but the characters really didn't play their part very well as they should have. I recommend it to everyone, but they should really try the book instead."
3,How original!,"What I liked about this story was how dazzlingly original the characters and plot elements were. A young farmboy who finds a secret weapon and becomes the savior of the land? A bearded wizard who guides him to maturity? A spunky princess in need of rescuing? A besieged group of good guys who triumph unexpectedly when all seems lost? The henchman's evil right-hand man who is killed, beyond all hope, at the very last moment?Truly groundbreaking."
1,Disappointing,"I watched this in the theater with my son. The first 20 minutes of it are pleasant and wonderful.Then the shift comes in tone, scenes are edited quickly. Episodes from the second book are introduced to fill gaps. The story becomes one great big mess. Whole other episodes go unfilmed, unexplained.My son who had such glee for the first two reels walked out of the theater fairly angry.He ticked off several things wrong with the picture's framework, and large gaps in the story line, missing important elements.PS: he doesn't want to even think about owning a DVD of the feature."
3,Eragon is a movie for nearly everyone,"Eragon is a movie with one powerful message. You are stronger than you realize. The scenes are beautiful, the action will keep you on the edge of your seat and the storyline is both inspiring and at times very touching.Eragon is a farm boy (played by Ed Speleers) that finds a dragon's egg that leads him on a journey in which he defends his home from an evil king. One of the villains of the film, Durza (played by Robert Carlyle) did a great job portraying his character and the makeup was, for lack of a better description, evil.The movie was a bit too short and more could have been added, but for stunning visuals and a great story this is a good movie to see."
1,I think I've seen this before,"I have not read the books, but it may be just me but this seemed like a cheap rip off of Star wars. Only set in some mid evil dragon land. A poor peasant boy finds he has some strange power with the help of his mentor who trains him to use the force I mean dragon riding power, He goes to the death start, I mean evil persons castle to save the princess, The mentor dies blah blah blah, they join the rebel alliance to fight the evil empire in one big last battle and win in the end. Save your money and watch you copy of Star Wars."
4,Movie Review or Blue Ray Review?,"I love the fact that there are reviews posted for this movie even before it is released on Blue Ray. Ladies and Gentlemen...may I have your attention please! I am interested in how the Blue Ray version compares to the DVD version...NOT YOUR OPINION OF THE MOVIE!Lol...seriously...I am not going to buy this movie based on how much you like it (or not) but the quality of the Blue Ray its self. Stop wasting readers' time with how Hollywood messed up another book-to-movie translation. Instead, tell me how do the sound effects sound compared to the rather weak ones that come with the standard DVD? How is the 1080p quality of the film?If you want to pretend to be a movie critic to to metacritics.com or some other site where this type of information is wanted and appreciated. These reviews are for people considering paying the extra for a Blue Ray as opposed to another DVD!Thank you for your time."
4,Blu-ray Looks & Sounds Great,"Sure it's not the world's best movie, but it is a pretty good storythat our family enjoys.Compared to the regular DVD, there is a big difference in Picture,and the HD DTS sound ain't to shabby either.So catch it when it's on sale, and you're sure to enjoy it."
1,A steaming pile of dragon dung...,"After watching this ridiculous, plodding and boring movie, you'll feel a compelling urge to wipe and flush. And I thought Narnia was a second-rate Lord of the Rings, but sadly, it puts Eragon to shame. Aside from the stellar CG work, you have top tier actors like John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons reciting third rate, cornball lines and acting like medieval hams from a Monty Python movie, scenes that rapidly jerk to and fro like a bad Goth music video, and young unknown actors that recite lines mechanically as if they graduated from the George Lucas school of acting. There is no continuity and no emotional build up to scenes, and worse, there is little direction in trying to tell even the least semblance of a semi-cohesive story. Stay far away from this vapid nugget of juvenile Fantasy tripe and check out Dragonheart if you're looking for a decent Fantasy movie about dragons."
2,Strays too far from the book..........A real let-down.,"I really had high hopes for Eragon back in December. It's one of my favorite books (Very good, read it). But, much to my dismay, Eragon left a bad taste in my mouth. I mean, it wasn't unwatchable-I could sit through it again-but too many things weren't served justice (Ask any book fan, having the dragon grow within a few seconds-as apposed to a chapter or two in the book-was really disappointing). If you must, rent it, but please take my word for it: this movie does not belong in your collection."
2,I'm easy to please and this didn't,"Okay, I pretty much will go along with most movies for one reason or another, whether it be effects, plot line, or great casting. The true jewels of movie making are those that contain all the above.The only reason I even own this movie is because I like the effects. It at least has a discernable plot line even though it's inaccurate in comparison to the book. Much of the acting was poor (especially Galbatorix. Yikes!) and the scenery was not what one would expect from a Middle Earth film. LOTR puts it to shame.This film was clearly low budget, though not as bad as it could have been I suppose. It's worth having around for giggles, but don't pay more than 6 bucks for it."
2,Two Thumbs Down,"Eragon- While the actors and special effects were excellent, I couldn't get over the story line. I read and liked the book. They skipped and completely left the story line in the movie so often it was hard to keep up. If I were Chris Paolini I would be furious at how they butchered my story. The dumbest part was when Saphira was first learning to fly. She took off a baby dragon and came back full grown. This book's story was destroyed in the theater. Maybe my expectations were too high as I went to see the movie looking for Lord of the Rings quality and I got a USA up all night with Joe Bob Briggs movie. Had they made this movie 3 1/2 hours long and stayed with the story line it would have rivaled Lord of the Rings. As it is we may never see Eldest in theaters."
2,How Disappointing!!!,"I have been counting down the days to this movie. I haven't been this excited to see a movie in a long time. How sad I was when the movie was over. Not because it ended but because how much they marred it from the book. I really loved the book and I understand that the movie will cut bits from the book to squeeze it all in but what was the reasoning for making it totally different??? It left out so many important issues, people and places. I do not see how they can make a second movie when they totally screwed up the first. I gave it two stars because my kids (who didn't read the book) did enjoy the movie."
2,TV frozen dinner version of a 5 Star gourmet meal. Eat it fast!,"This movie was entertaining and well produced. Acting, production, cinematography, costume, story - all better than average. Thats were the good stuff ends. No suspense. Bad character development. Poor plot development. Rush Rush Rush. Everything happens too fast. If done slightly different this movie could have possibly been the next Star Wars. Or at least a highly popular franchise. I just do not understand what the thinking is behind the trend to make movies like video games. Do the producers really believe the general viewing public is that brain dead? I will not tell you what happens in the end. There is a scene that happens in a period of 5 seconds. Yes 5 seconds. Very important scene. I was glad I had the dvd so I could back up and see it again. If you were in the move theater and reached over to grab your drink you would have missed it.The only thing the movie did for me was kindle my desire to read the book."
2,Bad imitation of an Epic movie,"This movie leaves you with too many unanswered questions! I strongly believe that whoever made this movie did not take time to develop each character. It reminds me of stories my mother used to tell me when I was little which were badly told because my mother is not a writer, but that is understandable. At least she didn't try to make her stories into lame movies with empty characters and a poor dialog.I got to say that the only good thing was the boy flying on the dragon and the dragon."
3,Eragon Dragon,"Eragon finds a stone while hunting for deer in the forest. Its an egg, in fact, a dragon egg, and it decides to hatch and mark Eragon as its rider. There aren't many dragons left in Eragon's world, and the ruler (who rules because of his own dragon) wants any other riders out of the way...I thought it was pretty decent at the time, but the more I think about it, the less I know why. There's mention of elves and such, but the only fantasy characters seen are the dragon and a couple of soldier-types. I've got a couple of plot questions as well.It's okay, not terribly inspiring though."
1,what a joke,"ok so you know a movie is bad when you can make fun of it out loud in the theater and nobody cares. after seeing this movie i have no intention of reading the books. i keep hearing a lot of lord of the rings comparisons, and rightfully so. however, the first hour of this movie is an complete rip off of another famous trilogy. this movie practically took the screenplay from star wars and inserted it into a lord of the rings type setting. this movie is just another corporate pawn used to con the consumer out of some hard earned money. do yourself a favor and never see this movie...ever."
2,The movie is an abridgement,"In order to tell the tale, a movie in the range of three hours would have been required. Instead, you are given about half of that (102 minutes). Instead of a solid bridge from start to finish, you are given stepping stones, some of which are covered in moss.To make matters worse, the actors seem over-rehearsed and uninspired. In some cases, the actors may have been miscast.The bottom line is this: READ THE BOOK. If you want to experience this story, there is no shortcut, you must read the book. I am confident you will find the written story a fine one indeed; worthy of reading."
2,What a waste,"I was really looking forward to this movie when they announced it after becoming a fan of the novels but it was a terrible let down. The whole movie is a complete mess, it rushes so fast you're just sitting there wondering if they accidentally cut out parts in the editing room. The beginning of the movie was the worst; rush, rush rush! Can't believe they released it like this, no character developement, important parts in the book completely left out of the movie, you don't care about any of the characters.The only thing I enjoyed a tiny bit was the Eragon/Shade battle, I LOVED the Shade character, but like everything else, it just flew right by leaving you wanting so much more.Give me a 3 hour movie, break up book one into two films, either way is fine with me...but please, NEVER rush through a movie like this."
1,"And this enhances the book, how?","I bought the DVD, intending to play it on my laptop. What a mistake.The sound is either DTS, DD, Spanish, or French. No stereo. If you like echoes, they are there.To the director, when you read the book (you did read it, didn't you?}, the information is presented in a logical order, building credability as the story progresses. NOT as you did it: showing a brief history at the beginning of the movie in an effort to fill in the backstory. This just made the move moot.Where is the continuity? Where is the wonder? Are those manniquins really dwarves? I thought elves had pointed ears (like Mr. Spock, you friggin' idiot!). Where is the bonding between Brom and Eragon? Why does Saphira grow to adulthood in a few seconds? How improbable is that? Is this your first film? If so, quit now. As a director you lost the entire story.My advice? Read the books. DON'T buy the DVD. Especially if you don't have a home theater.I'm sorry I did."
2,Disappointing Quality,My son loves this movie so I got it for him for Christmas. I was under the impression that it was a 'new' dvd. It has a scratch on it so the movie has a long spot in the middle that is really messed up. My son didn't tell me about it until it was too late.
2,Falls Far Short of the Book,"As a movie, it's fine and enjoyable. As a movie based on the fantastic book Eragon, it falls far short. This movie had the potential to be epic - in the league of Lord of the Rings - but instead we are handed just another dragon movie. It is the kind of movie you expect to find on TV on a quiet Sunday afternoon. It is very enjoyable as long as you don't expect it to be epic, as it should be based on the book.I was disappointed in all that was left out. One of the impressive things about the book was the development of characters and their relationships, but this is entirely lacking in the film. If you watch this movie, set your hopes for it low. It is an enjoyable dragon movie as long as you expect it to be just another dragon movie, but it does not live up to the book."
1,Eragon Wanabe,"I have read this book and part of Eldest, the sequel, and the only reason I understood the movie was becuase I had read the books. The acting was pretty good and it was actually a good film for children who aren't allowed to whatch gory moveis. The goriest part of the movie was when a carchter inserted his poisened fingernail into sombody's body, and another character's forehead. To sum it up it was a movie going a mile a minute and not explaining well"
2,Can you say Cliche?,"This movie was watchable only because of the dragon special effects. I found the entire story cliche and out right laughed at some scenes as the appeared to be ripped from other movies, the rescripted badly.All in all I think Dungeons and Dragons was a better movie in this genre."
4,Tale of a boy and his dragon,"You'll want to read the novel to get the full value of this story. Might as well say that right off. However, the film is entertaining on its own, though they had to revise things to fit within the time limits on the screenplay. My 16 year old son was a little disappointed that there were parts of the book left out, or even changed, but it was still a good adaptation. When a young boy named Eragon stumbles upon an egg containing a magical dragon, the lad is saddled with a responsibility that dates back years. Can he fulfill a legendary destiny, or will Eragon's stubborn nature get in his way?Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,Whats the point of Blu-Ray,"Fantastic movie but where are the special features. I thought the point of blu-ray was the space capabilities. Well once again, i think it is Sony sucking money out of customers. I was debating on the Blu-ray or the special edition version and made a poor decision as far as assuming the special features were included with the blu-ray. Don't get me wrong. The movie is fantastic (5 star) but the media was a 1 star. If your are the person that enjoys the extras (deleted scenes or making of's) then this is not worth the extra cash.And as far as i am concerned, HD-DVD should win"
1,RIPOFF,"I purchased the UNBOX version, or ""The International Release"" of Eragon. The movies' picture disappeared after 42.10 minutes, but not the sound. Amazon should give me a refund of this defective download. IF they don't, it will be the LAST DL I purchase.As for the story. One word: LAME. I've read Anne Bishop, Eddings, David Drake, all the Pern novels, and more books in Sci Fi/Futuristic than I can remember.Eragon reminded me of Star Wars for kindergarten. Pern-gone-to-Thread-and-back-again.The movie was a bust. Characterization was minimal, adversarial relationships were simplistic and almost insulting to anyone with an IQ above 18.If you're 8 and your parents don't mind your brain being sucked out of your skull from inanity...buy the book."
5,Film,"I have seen the movie in the cinema and it is wicked! The books r brill and Christopher Paolini is a geniusSaphira is beautiful, although i read she took a year 2 animate. This film is wicked."
5,I like it.....Im gonna buy it...So HA!,"I really like it. the book is took thick for me to read and I dont have time. in fact it was due a month ago. The movie is awesome. We all know you cant always compare a movie to the book 100%. People who hate this movie just looking fo somthing stupid in this movie. Thust me, this movie is really good."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made!,"Worst Movie Ever Made!Need I say more?Nope.Oh yeah, don't buy it and don't even attempt to watch this.I regret buying this. I want my $5 back!"
3,Eragon (Widescreen Edition),"Eragon (Widescreen Edition) is a movie based on the book by the same title by Christopher Paolini. Not having read the books I did not come in with any expectations how it should be. However, even so I do have the feeling that the movie feels short. The storyline could have been much more developed and some of the scenes just seem rushed. For instance the growth of the dragon happens in an instance. The special effects are alright but nothing special. While I am not a disappointed as many as the other reviewers I can still say that I can only give this movie a 3 out of 5. Maybe a directors cut will come and settle things right. 3/5."
2,Read the books,"Wife read the books. I have started the first. It is always fun seeing a directors, producers, screenwriters, vision of the characters and setting, but the movie did not fly as well as us or most people we have talked to.1st star for the movie existing.2nd star for the vast effort made by all the people in making a film that fell $25,000,000 short domestically.Although in the foreign markets $174,457,952 is not too shabby. Maybe when they translated it they added a story."
1,"I haven't read the book, but my son has.","And he was disappointed by the glaring omissions in this movie. I will also add that the acting was bad and that the special f/x were subpar. We rented the HD version through Amason Instant Video, so I guess the one good thing I can say was that displayed ok on our HDTV set in 1080p, without any network glitches."
1,One of the WORST movies I have seen in a long time...,"It should be FORBIDDEN to release such a BAD movie... Poorly written, boring, a waste of time and money. I WASTED about 2 hours of my life in this absolutely idiotic movie... It is a bad take-off on Lord of the Rings... even the bad guys look like the bad guys in Lord of the Rings... The story is totally ridiculous, including a dragon who suddenly ""thinks"" in perfect English... with the voice of a girl. All the characters and the story itself are totally unbelievable.The acting is horrible... the story is worse... Things happen with no explanation... The hero's brother disappears at the beginning, and at the end a new character enters the story... It is without a doubt THE WORST movie I have seen in 2006..."
3,Trailers,"I've been watching the trailers over and over and after reading the books think this could be a problem... Probably shouldn't of read the books first. Mainly I'm going to see this movie for Brom, Murtagh and Ajihad. I love Sienna Guillory from Helen of Troy (and Arya is one of my favorite characters) but I'm confused about the way they made her look to play Arya. For one... Arya has dark hair (not strawberry blond)... and the major thing... she's an elf. The author repeats over and over that she has dark hair and pointed elf ears (think Arwen here). So what's up with the regular human ears and the light hair? Didn't the people who made the movie read the books at all?I'm hoping the movie does live up to the book but I'm not entirely sure based off the way it looks now. Saphira, Brom, Murtagh and Ajihad look great though so I'm looking forward to watching them. I hope Ed Speleers' Eragon lives up to his role in the books and I hope the movie doesn't make me regret buying the tickets."
3,the book was better,a regular movie didn't do it justice. really needed to be like lord of the rings. you couldn't get to know the characters. that boy has SO much talent. it really needs to be a mini series.
3,Read the book,"While the movie was entertaining, unfortunately I had read the book first and the movie just cannot compare. If you are really interested in this type of story reading Christopher Paolini's book is a must!"
3,Ok movie,"Simple dialoge, a few too many holes in the plot, and no character developement. A good flick adventure for the kids, not much their for adults. An average movie."
2,Great Idea Goes Limp,"A child would love this movie - they don't care whether or not relationships or situations are established for more than 1-5 minutes. And while I enjoyed the magical tones of this movie - there seemed more of a lame-scent to development of the plot. I attempt to keep my inner-child alive with movies that take away the years...but this movie couldn't keep me from falling asleep or making comments about what a waste of money it was as a rental, let alone the thought of reserving this movie before it came out on video. I only hope that this review helps you...but every person has their own tastes. (Thinking back on receiving the many, viable warnings about 'Punch Drunk Love'...)"
1,Eragon,"This is the biggest blunder of a movie based on a book I ever saw. My son and I have read the book. It doesn't follow the book in any way that one can appreciate. I had to give it one star because there isn't anything lower, but I would have given it half a star because the only thing appealing was the special effects and maybe the costumes. The acting was so bad you knew they were acting. Very sad. Don't waste you money!"
3,Enjoyable,"Due to its incredible special effects and great fighting sequences, I believe this film deserves three stars. Although the movie is sped through tremendously, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I liked how it was directed towards children, yet I thought it could also be directed to an older audience, to deliver more seriousness. As far as sticking with the book, they without a doubt did an unimpressive job. Half the cast's acting was extraodinary, and the other half was simply awful. Robert Carlyle (Durza), was most impressive. This film is definitely not as bad as some people say, but of course there could have been some improvements. Overall I thought this movie was great, and when seeing it in theatres I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. If you see this movie it will fill the cinematic part of your mind with action, adventure, and fantasy -- all qualities this movie has."
1,Couldn't pay me enough to buy this movie,"I was so excited to see this movie. I'd read the book three times. Of all the movies I have seen where I first read the book, this one is the worst. I was so disappointed at the hack job and injustice the movie industry did to this story. If you haven't read the book then this movie might be interesting. I advise all those who haven't read ""Eragon"", GET THE BOOK! Don't rely on the movie to amaze you. So much is missing in this movie. I am a huge fan of Jeremy Irons and his acting if fine, but he does not embody the character of Brom. And what's up with Arya? She looks more like an indian princess with feathers in her hair instead of the strong, dark elf that she is in the book. Believe me, your time and money will be better spent reading the book instead of going to see this movie."
2,Eragon,Disk #1 worked great first two times through. Since then maybe it will play straight through and maybe it will NOT. Seems to be trial and error.
3,You've seen this before....,"Remember that movie Star Wars?Well, this is Star Wars all over again, right down to ""There's nothing you could have done had you been here, you'd have been killed too and the [egg] would now be in the hands of the empire!""""I want to learn [to be a dragon rider] and take on the empire!""His teacher even dies a death at the right moment, granting the boy another power up (this movie follows the Kung Fu heroic power up model where every tragedy gives him a new level of power gain).All that aside, it's not a bad movie. Take it for what it is.Seriously though, Think of Star Wars when watching it."
1,Not another ruined book-to-movie!,"Where to begin? This movie was unclear and skippy. All the IMPORTANT things-- Teirm, Tronjheim, Hadrac Desert, Brom... Completely under done. If it didn't say ERAGON on the cover, I wouldn't have even thought they were related! No, no, no-- if the book had was NOT supposed to be based on the book, it would have been a mediocre movie-- But the script writers managed to break diamond and destroy the glory of a beautifully written book. I never want to see a movie so tarnished: it made it look like they lived in mud huts, all the while the book described houses! This movie broke my heart and made me afraid to see another book-movie.Let's hope that they don't reck Inkheart or Twilight...~Megan"
1,I didn't even want to waste my time.,I had to force my way through reading the book. I thought it was horribly written. Tried to hard to be Lord of the Rings. I knew just from watching the previews to the movie it was going to be way worse. It was. I can't believe I even tried watching it. You'd think they'd try to hold to the story a bit more. If I were the author I would of been so mad! TOTAL WASTE!
1,Don't bother,This movie was such a poor representation of the novel that Paolini should sue. The book was not a love story. The movie is little else. Only the wonderful depiction of the dragon afforded this film any salvation.
4,"To be better, we would all still be in the theatre.","Yeah I would like the Movie to be longer, but 15 hrs could not do this great story any more justice. I loved it and cannot believe the negative reviews. It will take its place along with the Harry Potter sieries. I am well over 13 and a little beyond 55."
1,Cutting floor debris from Lord of the Rings,"How could Jeremy Irons sink to this level? How could John Malkovich perform in this piece of dreck? In fact Malkovich overacts to the point you begin to wonder if he wasn't trying to turn this into a comedy. The lead character -- Eragon -- is a simpleton played by an actor whose only claim to fame must be his relationship with the director because it certainly isn't his acting. He merely poses and looks handsome throughout the film. Jeremy Irons does try to act but then to act you must have a script, which is sorely lacking here. Like most current films the personal hygiene is subpar and seems to be used as a gauge for evil. There are hordes of bad guys all of whom are suitably ugly and look like what's left over from Middle Earth. There was a Dragon in this film which seemed to be the only point of making the film. This is a film that should come with a warning label for bad acting and writing."
2,Missed the mark!,"Eragon is a great book, and apparently just that. I had eagerly been awaiting the relase of the film and was sorely disapointed in it. There is way too much information in the book to shove into a 2 hour movie and too many key aspects of the book are missing. What should have evolved over months appeared to have taken maybe a week. Key elements in the history and growth of the characters were entirely omitted and the lack of character development left me feeling very little for these characters. In the end I walked out with thoughts that mostly consisted of ""who was he and what just heppened?"".Its too bad because the book is great and had a lot of promise to be a really great movie."
1,what a disappointment,"This movie had the possiblity of being another Lord of the Rings and then threw it away. This bares little resemblance to the book. There is NO character development..you really do not care what happens to these people, the director and writers of the script left out everything that made these characters important and endearing. The only one they manage to leave alone is the dragon. There are no elves, what did they do to the Urgals? And who cares about the Varden? The only interesting character beside the dragon is the shade..and what happened to him? His makeup suddenly changed and you are left wondering if this is the same bad guy? This movie butchers what was a fantastic book and makes it into a mockery. Lets just pray they do not go ahead with the sequels. So please read the book and ignore the movie."
5,Eragon,A ture adventure in the Dragon and rider style of drama. It does have a few new twists from other dragon stories. I really enjoyed it.
2,Eragon The Movie (NOT THE BOOK),"There are so many movies that have been made from book, sorry to say that this isn't one of them. It is a nice movie nut don't buy it just because you loved the book like I did."
4,Eragon was much better than I expected it to be,"After reading the many reviews on Amazon I was skeptical to watch this movie, but I wanted to see it and judge for my self. Eragon was much better than I expected it to be. Eragon is a 17 year old guy who discovers a mysterious blue object that turns out to be an egg that hatches to reveal a dragon named Saphira. Eragon discovers that it is his destiny to become a dragon-rider like those great riders before him. Eragon has no choice but to face the evil King Galbatorixa and his dark magic. With the help from former dragon-rider Brom, and a beautiful warrior-maiden named Arya, Eragon faces the forces of evil with his dragon Saphira. This movie has a some what predictable plot, but it was a fun entertaining movie. The Blu-ray disc has a great picture and great sound, but sadly lacks the bonus features found on the special edition 2 disc DVD."
1,TERRIBLE TRANSLATION,"This was the WORST book to movie translation!!! I stumbled into this movie and throught it was pretty good, so I ran out and bought the book...shouldn't have done that! RUINT, RUINT I tell you, the movie should have been made like the lord of the rings or something!! Totally slashed the book, anialated it, the movie should have never been made like this!"
2,Special effects,"I typically don't do this but this movie was so bad I felt obligated. Watched this over the weekend. I had read the book, which I was not that impressed with (give me Anna McCaffrey, Tolkien..J.K. Rowlings). I was hoping the movie would be better but unfortunately I liked it even less than the book. My husband liked it, he did not read the book, but his comments when I asked him what he liked about the movie was ""the special effects were great""."
1,a good book ... very bad movie,Not a single sentence in this DVD is true to the book. I don't like the casting either.
1,I liked it better the first time,"I liked it better the first time, when it was called STAR WARS....Darth Vader should be in the sequel when he asks Eragon to join the dark side.I really wonder how George Lucas feels about this..?"
2,Lord of the Wannabee,"If ever there was a poor man's Lord of the Rings, this would be it.Wow...it was sooo bad!The special effects were ok sometimes. Sometimes. Other times they looked like PS1 graphics.The costumes and set design were so cheesy and the acting was pretty bad. Especially the villains who ham it up every step of the way. And the actors were all wrong for their roles. None of them looked the part. Especially the lead who looked like he should be standing outside an Abercrombie and Fitch store in the mall.And a lot of scenes seemed very...umm...Brokeback Dragon to me. Especially one scene with the main character and his cousin! Those were the only interesting parts. The rest had me falling asleep.There are supposed to be two more of these movies?? I hope they get a better director and script writer."
1,Maybe in the future...,"Perhaps when the Eragon series has been around as long as the Lord of the Ring series, someone will give it a more devoted treatment as a movie. This one is laughably bad, however. Stick with the books. I also highly recommend the unabridged book on CD. The reader does a terrific job."
2,A Fan's Review,"I'm a huge fan of the series, Inheiretance. Look people anyone knows that if you loved the book you will not like the movie! I'm telling you people, you will not like this movie if you're a fan of the book, Eragon. I have to admit that they did Saphira well, they could've have done a tad better but that's hollywood.This is just a warning for all those fans of the book that got severely dissapointed or who didn't see it. If you're a fan of the book then you're wasting your money."
2,"Cartoony film, bad acting","I have never read Eragon, but I was attracted by the advert with the beautiful dragons and epic scenary. I was really, really, disappointed to find myself sitting through another re-hash of Star Wars- but with dragons. I might even have been able to take the storyline, if the lines were good. But all the lines were so bland, so utterly immature I found myself yawning within the first 15 minutes. I've seen more mature dialog in a saturday morning cartoon.The costuming was pretty good, particularly the dragon-rider regalia. I also liked the dragon when she was a baby! So cute!But overall, this was a limp insipid film, dumbed down for the kiddies."
1,The title is the same. That's about it!,"Do Not Buy This Movie!!!!!!!!!!It is so far from the book that it might be a different story altogether!Please RENT it first, then decide. I really wish I could return mine!!!"
1,Not the book.,The book was awesome. The Movie called eragon was a jumpy action flick that made little to no sense. Since when do elves not have pointy ears and when did dwarves get so tall? In no way does the movie follow the book. You will be wondering if the director read the book. The worst part is the beginning 200 pages smashed into 10 minutes. If the book didnt have an action scene in a chapter it was skipped. The worst part about the making of this movie is that its so terrible people who see it and havent read the book will think that the book must be just as bad. A weak adaptation of a brilliant young minds work.
2,Eh... could have been SO much better,"This flick could have been SO much better. It almost seemed like the producers were rushing into production. Compared to the book this movie comes off as a made-for-tv special, except then they could have made it into a mini-series and done much better. Events and characters are mixed up so much so you don't get a good feel for the story."
3,THe Movie vs the Book,"I had read the Book First. I was disapointed with the movie because it left out a large portion of the story. The graphics were excelent, but with the changes I missed, as anyone who sees the movie will, the personal development of the charactors. There were some elements missing that would have an impact on the future episodes.I strongly recomend reading the book first, as well as the next 2 books.Eldest is out now. I am still waiting for the last book to be published."
1,horrible,"great book, too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds. i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie, almost didn't finish reading it. they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film. on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira's voice was right on, and while the movie character of Brom was fully wasted, jeremy irons did a fine job. i look forward to starting the next book, but will skip the next movie."
1,Very Disapointing,This was a very disappointing movie! If you are a fan of the book you will hate the movie.They left so much important information and changed so much else. Rohan is not leaving just to leave. Sphira did not name herself. Where was the dwarf that meat Eragon at the door of the Varden and road off with him and so much else.Although I read the book my husband was completely lost and asked a ton of questions.This was like watching Lord of the rings and not telling you about Bilbo's impute or the back ground on the ring you would of been lost.
2,"To quote Eragon: ""I expected more""","Great actors, great marketing, great special effects. This film is not so bad, but it pretends to be so much more than it is. When we got to the talking dragon I understood why.We're spoiled with good children's movies which are fun for the grown ups as well, but this movie is a kid's movie for kids. Would have loved it when i was 12. But then I even loved the ""Narnia"" TV-series. Actually, the Narnia movie (2005) was kind of like this one, in my opinion. I didn't like that film either.Fantasy freaks might enjoy it as well. Maybe it should have had 3 stars, but the story is kind of dull, and I was disappointed."
1,Basura,"Tremenda basura de pelicula no la vean, no tiene sentido, no malgasten su dinero.Porqueria,porqueria, porqueria."
3,"good but, sounds familiar","I hadnt read the book (my son did) so I went into this movie with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprized. The animation was fantastic. And the actors did a great job. I left hoping for part 2!But...growing up in the 70's I couldnt help but scratch my head a bit, at the downright similarities between this movie and Star Wars. Ex- A Farm boy with a destiny...raised by his uncle...(who dies!) parents mysteriously missing from the picture. In fact Eargon was very much like Luke Skywalker! I thought the characters could have been more original. It had already been done. In fact there was even the scene with Eragon looking out at the sunset...or sunrise....just like Luke! hum.If Arya turns out to be his sister...or the bad guy is his Dad.....the author will have some explaning to do!"
4,GOOD MOVIE - NOT SO GOOD BLU_RAY,Movie was obviously better than standard DVD but I though that it was not the best Blu-ray adaptation I have seen
2,Amzing Book. Horrid Movie,The book was amazing. the film stinks. HUGE bits are cut out and it moves way to fats to make sense
4,Decent if you haven't read the books,"If you haven't read the books, this was a decent movie. But I also think the only reason I understood some things is because I read the books. Like many movies based on books a lot was cut out or switched around. So much so that I don't see how they can make any sequels without seriously upsetting the story. They barely touch on the elves and dwarves(which seem to be humans, you can't tell).Also skipping the werecat was like in LOTR skipping Tom Bombadill. How can you skip a character that had a major impact on the story?"
3,It's okay but could totally be better! a kid's review,"I had seen the commercials, ""man I cannot wait to get to se it."" Well I saw the movie it was awesome! After being so pumped up about the movie, it was only natural of me to read the book. After just a couple pages I realized that the movie STUNK! They changed like SO much and also added stuff that was so unnececery! Like at the end, Eragon did not kill Durza in a dragon fight, He killed Durza by stabbing him with Zarroc! Listen if you read the book first you will be disapointed, but if you read the book afterwards you will get to enjoy the movie then be dissapointed later. All-in-all I think that if you see the movie, you need to read the book. And for your information Eragon id an AWESOME BOOK!!!! I would totally recommened the book but the movie would be up to you.-BHC"
2,Better if you haven't read the book,"I have to agree with a lot of the reviews that have been written. This is a poor production of the book. If you want to enjoy this movie, watch it before reading the book. After you read the book, you be thinking about all of the stuff that was left out and how they changed the story. Its pace is too fast and you don't get any real character and relationship development.I am planning on getting rid of the copy I own and will not see any following movies, if they make them."
1,truly horrible!,"hi..... i know that movies are never (usually) as good as the book they are based on, but this movie hits an all time low. the book is good, not great, but good - or at least entertaining (if youve never read or seen star wars or lord of the rings, maybe you'll think its fantastic, but most of the storyline has been seen before) that aside, i enjoyed reading the book.... i dont think the director read it. the story flow is different, character personalities are different, the dragons voice is lacking, and so on. i watched the movie when i was sick in bed, and all i got out of it was frustration. i found myself saying, ""i cant believe they did this - it must get better...."" it doesn't.dont buy it"
2,Should have been better,"Should have been better, but the editing disrupted the flow of the story line. I have seen Lord of the Ring and this is no LOTR. Then again, it is better than the pitiful Dungeons and Dragons."
2,Dragon your feet,"I have never been a fan of fantasy films or books. The only reason I picked this up was because I have a thing for Garret Hedlund (the guy who plays Mertock). He did a good job despite all the annoying preachy dialogue, and being a tool of the special effects department. Otherwise the movie just drags on forever in your typical good and evil magical conflict. He's wonderful eye candy no matter where he is to me, but that was this one saving grace in my eyes. Otherwise it could have been much more than it was, moving quicker and trimming the fat."
3,Don't read it First!,"If you watch the movie without having read the books FIRST, then it is a nice movie.If you have already read them (I haven't read them yet) then it sounds like you will be extremely dissapointed if you expect the movie to be anything like the book.Maybe if you have already read the book(s) and you still want to watch it, you could try and pretend it is an unrelated movie that just happens to have a similiar title... maybe not. I guess I'll find out just how bad it seems after I've read the books.The dragon (Sephora?) is my favorite character."
3,Sad.,"Its alot less detailitive and really shorter than the book, which i highly reccomend. This movie...was a embarrassment."
1,I Almost Died...,"I am a large fan of the book, and was looking forward to seeing this.IT WAS TERRIBLE!It was so Hollywoodized I could barely breath, complete with cheesy one liners that should have found themselves on the cutting room floor.I the middle of the movie, I couldn't stop myself from standing up and screaming: ""LOOK OUT FRODO SKYWALKER! DARTH VOLDEMORT IS COMING TO KILL YOU WITH HIS LIGHT WAND!""It was shortened to a painful length, and the battle scene wasn't even good.I say a remake...Alfonso Cuaron for director."
2,so sad,When I heard that this movie was coming out I was really happy. I thought that it might be neat to see the book come to life on the screen but it seems more like the screen killed it. The dramatic moments from the book seemed like they had been torn out all together. In the book we were able to get close to the characters and see a little more of their human side. That is not the case with this movie. People die but we don't care. Battles are pretty boring and the enemies just don't reach the level of dangerous. There was hardly any adventure at all. All in all I'm glad I got it from the library and didn't waste my money. Turn of the TV and read the book.
3,"Review of the DVD = Good movie, poor extras","I loved the books, and this view of the literature was very entertaining. Some might get frustrated with what was left out of the movie, but this is only one interpretation of the book. No book to movie film is ever going to get it ""right,"" not until you get a semi Fahrenheit 451 stile of world. Were people won't just watch a film for just two hours and can devote time to watching an unabridged movie book.This however is not just a review of the movie, but a review of the DVD as a whole. When it comes to extras there is only one as far as added delight, commentary of the Director.All in all good movie and bad extras means a poor DVD. I would spend the extra money for those extras, not a Wal Mart, but here at Amazon for a better deal. Thank you and enjoy."
1,OMG,"How could they ruin such a great book in the course of an hour and a half. It has terrible dialogs, plot, flow, and explanation. If you haven't read the book you'll be even more lost."
3,A book lover's opinion.,"Now I'm a book fanatic...and so what I write is my construtive criticism.And I know I'll get some mean remarks to this, but I need to say it! I saw Eragon(the movie) and then read the book. Well you know what? There are tons of differences! Big surprise right? But here is MY question...What movie based on a book doesn't have lots of differences? Look at the Harry Potter movies! And other movies for crying out loud! I'm sorry but some people are being VERY hypocritacle. I personally give this movie a 3 because of its differences and how the movie went too fast. But I still like it. And the book IS GREAT."
3,"watchable but quite cliched, not great at all","after lord of the ring, battle for the middle earth, we got this cliched one again. but the special effects are not bad. the storyline not too tight. the problem is that with such violent killings in it, how parents could let their kids to watch it? but how could you make the adults to like this movie? what kind of age group this movie wanted to target in the first place? no wonder lotsa people hated this movie, rated r or pg13 or what? the scenery in this movie is very very beatiful, that you should not complain about."
2,Read the book,"The book has many details that should have been in the movie but weren't. Things like having Arya actually look like an elf, there should have been dwarfs with the Varden, the Urgals didn't have any horns. The storyline for the movie wasn't bad but it was poorly portrayed."
2,I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater.,"My sister recommended this movie on the basis of the books, which I've never read. After watching this, I'm afraid reading the books would be a waste of time. What a yawn-inducing movie. Even at the film's climax I wanted to turn it off. Please say the books are better than this."
2,Nothing like the book,It is an alright movie but nothing like the book. Read the book before you watch the movie. The screenwriter did not read the book before he wrote the screenplay for the movie.
4,A Good Movie,Eragon was a good movie as far as I'm concerned. It's story flowed well and was easy to follow. It is easily suited for all ages and would make a great family movie night.
4,glad waited,glad I waited to buy the dvd and didn't spend $$$ at the theater. there was one hiccup in the viewing but it didn't take away from the watching as many dvds seem to have at least one. better than a vcr eating a tape
4,TMBG bounces back again!,"This has to be TMBG's best creation in a while. Though I did like Mink Car - it had a very weak sound. Like half the band was missing - except for Cyclops Rock. I was hoping more for a return to the days of FLOOD, but I guess you can't go home after all. Some of the songs on The Spine are absolutely brilliant (Experimental Film - It's Kick'n in Ya - Museum of Idiots - just to name a few of my favs) and then others are just wishy washy, about nothing, and they're to bloody slow! Flans PLEASE STOP THE DREAMY LOVE SONG SLOW MELODY STUFF or I'M GOING TO BE SICK!!! Love and Cookies does NOT fit TMBG - in my opinion anyway.Out of possible stars I'd give this new album 4 out 5. Not their greatest - but if it is a testiment to the songs to come than I feel that THEY are on the right track!!Now I've got to hear The Spine Surfs Alone (it's the single and Amazon doesn't currently sell it - so surf over to www.theymightbegiants.com and purchase it online!)"
5,Good stuff,"It's good that they make clear to people that they are putting out childrens material separate from their normal stuff because some of these songs are funny only to people who get the self conscious humor. Songs like ""Experimental Film"" won't be enjoyed be all and ""Prevenge"" is almost too clever by half. They also don't try to make each song a sonic bookmark like they did early in their career so it may seem as if they've lost their touch, but that's not the case. They're just trying to write interesting songs and not necessarily interesting music anymore. It's definitely a more smooth approach and some may not like that, however, I do and I like their earlier stuff equally."
3,too short,"I don't know what happened to my other review. It never posted. anyway, to break it down, the songs are good. but there's not enough of them. the disc is only 36 minutes long, yet TMBG released 2 EPs surrounding it!?! This smacks of greed, though I'm hoping its not.Still, I'd give the disc a 3 1/2."
2,The new TMBG *EP*,I'd rate the music on this CD about 4 stars but they lose 2 stars for putting out what appears to be a normal full-length CD that clocks in at a mere 36 minutes. I have EPs that are longer than that.
2,Very Disappointing,"There are only 4 good songs on this album, and two of them were already on Indestructible Object (Memo to Human Resources and Au Contraire). The other two are Museum of Idiots and Damn Good Times. I guess that's not a terrible ratio for most bands, but the other songs on the album are borderline unlistenable. Yuck. I'm a devoted fan and this may be the first time that I've felt almost betrayed. How could TMBG think that people would enjoy most of these songs?"
4,"As an album, the best","This album is made up of very good songs, but it's true strength is not in individual tracks but the album as a whole. The album fits together wonderfully. It isn't just the clean transitions and fantastic mixing job. The album kicks off strong with Experimental Film and the end of every track is picked up with the perfect song to fill what's missing after.On the whole, the songs aren't their best. They're definately up there, and there are a couple choice tracks, but they're not perfect. Still, buy this album! Listen and love!"
3,good but not their best,"This album sounds like it was released a bit prematurely. There are a few great songs, but also some bogeys that should have been weeded out before it was released. Also, I feel like even the really good songs are not as developed as they can be, such that one has the urge to skip to the next track before they are finished. The cd is 36 minutes long, with about 25 minutes of good music. Overall, I think a bit of a step down from John Henry & Mink Car where you can enjoy pretty much all of the songs on the cds. Finally, I have to take issue with the people out there who didn't like Mink Car- I thought it rocked."
4,"If you like TMBG, check this out","I have not heard a heck of a lot of music from They Might Be Giants, but I came across something very interesting that I believe fans would enjoy. Check out the site www.homestarrunner.com. Then click under ""toons,"" then ""shorts,"" and click ""Experimental Film."" You will be treated to a video for the track ""Experimental Film"" with the characters of homestarrunner.com!!"
3,Just a few stand out.,"I've been a fan for a long time, and was very excited when I heard about the new album. Plus I loved the art work on the front. But this album just seems to be missing something. There are some really great ones such as Experimental Film, Au Contraire, It's Kickin' In and Damn Good Times. (The last two being surprisingly hard rock for TMBG.) And even the 2 Spine shorts aren't so bad. But many of the songs seem like retreads of older songs, and ""Bastard wants to hit me""? What the heck is that!??? I personally liked Mink Car, though I see many reviewers didn't. I think this album is a step down from there, and is definetly just for fans of TMBG. Better luck next time!"
4,Hoodoo these guise think they R?,"I borrowed this CD from the library out of curiosity and becuase I liked the ""cartoon"" artwork. I'd heard OF They Might Be Shrimps, but never heard any of their music (AFAIK).What I noticed about it on first listen was that many of the songs sounded like they were imitating someone else -- Julian Lennon, REM, the Raspberries. Not being familiar with them, is this their usual M.O.? Is it deliberate?I ended up liking it quite a bit, although it's a bit artsy-fartsy/metrosexual for my taste (I usually prefer stuff by Springsteen, J.S. Bach, Dwight Yoakam, as well as Ted Nugent's eponymous album and Deep Purple's ""Machine Head"")."
5,I always watched it when I was a kid.,"I LOVE this movie. This was the movie I grew up on as a kid. I watched it at least 5 times a day and never grew tired of it. About the tale of the American Rabbit, the ultimate superhero. Characterized by blue and white starred ears and a red and white stripped body. An excellent kids movie. BUY IT."
5,"When the bad guys were bad, and the good guys unflawed.","This movie aired the year after I was born. My parents recorded it on beta (remember that standard?), and it became my favorite movie two years later. Unlike many animes, the viewer will probably have little trouble establishing an emotional connection with the characters-- the reactions of the characters are not culture-specific, but rather universal.While the storyline seems to have been written with the superhero-loving kid in mind, there are overtones only catchable by adults or near-adults. This causes it to still be a feel-good movie, but also a study in the attitudes of the time when it was released.As the story of the rabbit Rob, who has come into a legacy which causes him to race into action against ill-willing villains as a striped and spangled super hero, this animated guy-joins-band-gets-gal classic harkens back to the movie era when bad guys were still bad, and heros had hearts of gold."
1,No spanish Audio Track,"i love this cartoon, but what i loved most is that id had an spanish track , but for this season 2 theres is no spanish audio track, this is very disapointing."
3,She-ra season 2,"I thought it'd be worth listing all the DVD sets necessary to have all the He-Man and She-ra episodes.He-Man had 2 seasons of 65 episodes each, on DVD asHe-Man season 1 vol 1, He-Man season 1 vol 2, He-Man Season 2 vol 1, He-Man season 2 vol 2.She-Ra had a 65 episode first season, also in vol 1-2, and a 28 episode 2nd season (this DVD volume being reviewed here). Watch for occasional guest appearances of He-Man, in the She-ra series. As long-time fans will know, He-Man and She-Ra are brother and sister, as explained in the first five episodes of She-ra season one volume 1.The only other item to collect is ""He-Man and She-Ra: A christmas special"", in which the characters go to earth for christmas.If you buy all the above, there's no need to buy ""The Best of He-Man"" or ""The Best of She-Ra"", which are only subsets of the above."
5,best show ever.,"This show was my favorite growing up. Was one of the first shows, in which women were the ones kicking the butt and saving the men. for that I thank them. I loved seeing strong women saving the day. I'm very happy with my dvds. thank you bic for the remastering of She-Ra. my only small grip is that I wanted more comentary and I swear I'm missing some eps. but that could be a faulty memory. anyway a great buy for all She-Ra fans. This is the stuff I'd have my own children watch. not any of that crap they put out today and call it childrens programing."
5,She-Ra,"I didn't watch this product. I merely bought it on behalf of a friend, and my friend watched it. He said that he liked it very much. I don't like cartoons very much except for Rocky and Bullwinkle."
1,"""Mistake or lie"" about the content on this DVD","the box of the ""SHE-RA season two"" says clearly ""ENGLISH 2.0 STEREO - ESPAÑOL 2.0 STEREO"" But the fact is that this seasons NOT include spanish lenguage! (...?)no DUB no SUBS...the SHE-RA dvds collection is Just one more incomplete serie for latin and spanish fans..what a Disappointment."
2,Fun but it won't last,The game is a blast everyone that playes it loved it but after a week of use the PVC joints started to come apart. And the balls came off the string. I would not buy this product again because of how much it breaks.
3,Lasso golf is a great game but it has a problem...,the game is fun to play execpt for one problem if someone throws the bolo balls too hard or tries to move the goal posts the plastic tubes come out of thier too sockects easisly
2,"Great Set, but doesn't hold up","This is a great game, and a ton of fun to play, but the durability on this is very very poor. The first day you'll play it the balls were fall of the string, but this is easily fixed by just tying a larger knot. The problem is that over time the plastic balls actually rip where the strings attach, making them useless.I definitely plan on buying another set because I really enjoy it, but will look for another brand."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I was sceptical to spend [...] on this, payed [...]on sale w/tax ([...]). We just played it for a couple hours, yeah like the other reviews say, it's ""light-duty"", yeah the tubes on the base seperated from time to to time, just push 'em back together. It holds up though if you don't play rough, use it as intended. I don't know wh so many others have problems, unless 3 and 4 years are using it too rough? Should hold up for a while under ""normal"" usage.Next year I will make one out of PVC, PVC would hold up to a lot more rigorous use.Bot this will do. The balls are fine. Again; I don't know why so many reviewers are having problems, not indestructable... but not made of dimes stror quality either. Cheap Taiwan crap? Not exactly, not the better quality either. worth $20.. but not a penny more!"
2,Unimpressed with the quality,The game is a ton of fun. That is not the issue here. The quality of this version of the game is terrible. Buy a better version or make it yourself. It begins to not be fun when you have to reattach the posts every other time someone throws it.
4,lasso golf,"great game. lots of fun for family and friends. folds down to take anywhere. a little tough to take apart and put back together, but sturdy when set up."
4,der,Delivery was prompt. The game parts can't be glued with pvc glue to avoid easily falling apart while playing game.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this in the hopes of not having to make my own out of PVC. That was a huge mistake. The quality of the set is very poor. One of the horizontal poles was smaller on one end and did not stay in the corner piece. I contacted Halex for a replacement, which they sent, but the new part was even smaller than the one I had.I was able to use an o-ring to get the original pole in place but even then, when using the set, it tended to come apart during use.I ended up building my own out of 1"" PVC from designs I found on the web and it works much better. It was simple to make, much sturdier and the bollos actually have more ""action"" on the sturdier design. By action I mean things like spinning around on the lowest pole several times and then hopping up to the middle pole. Much more fun.Use your money to make your own. All it takes is a tape measure, a rubber mallet or hammer, and a hack saw (a Workmate is nice for holding the pipe while sawing but not required.)"
1,Not Great,"Saw this game over July 4th weekend so decided to buy one. Granted I did not spend too much time online looking for the right one and for that I regret that.This product is terrible, it broke on the first day. It's weak, not strong enough to last. It's already in bits.Look / search for a stronger one, spend a few more $$ it will be worth it.Bad Buy"
1,Pieces made wrong,I could not get the bottom black horizontal stabilizing bar to fit. The connecting joints were made so that it wouldn't fit. Or if you fit them the colored bars wouldn't so you have to choose one or the other. Not portable to break down either. Just make your own. This is a piece of crap. You can make bolas by drilling holes into golf balls. Very disappointed the pieces were not made to fit. couldn't assemble without leaving the lower stabilizing bar out.
3,An OK clock,"The inside of the clock is empty except for a two-inch speaker and the small quartz controlled motor that has places for two C-cell batteries. The chime sounds are a digital recording of real chimes and sounds convincing despite the small speaker. All of the Howard Miller quartz mantel clocks that I have seen use the same internal components so only the case materials differ from model to model.The external finish on this Graham Bracket III clock was fairly good. The finish on a less expensive Howard Miller mantel clock I examined was pretty bad, but OK I guess if you didn't get too close to it."
5,Panda Licorice,"This is a fantastic product. All natural and for a licorice (un)liker like myself, this is a great way to enjoy licorice. You will not be dissapointed with this product."
2,"Kinda boring. Touchy feely much like ""single fin yellow"".","Overall, it was ok. I rented this title from Amazon and after watching it I felt a bit unsatisfied. The film just dragged along and nothing really stands out thinking back on it now. I'm really into longboarding and wish something would come out that had a little more strength and forward movement. Im hoping ""Tyler warren Experiments"" meets my expectations and or the kookbox film ""bootleg"". This film just has such a ho-hum, melancholy feel. I'm glad I watched it but with that being said I wish I had of ripped it instead of rented but I'm seriously glad I did't purchase this one. If ya know what I mean."
4,Great compilation of works played by first class pianists,"I suppose that this CD is primarily aimed at people who are not that well acqainted with classical music. As such it is a great introduction to the classical solo piano repertoir.However, this compilation also works for those who are well acqainted with classical music because this CD showcases excellent playing by some of the greatest pianists of the latter part of the 20th century.The sound quality is fine.Well worth buying used for next to nothing!"
5,Air Buddies,The movie was a great movie. My granddaughter every loves to watch it. We she comes over she watches it at least 10 times.
3,Worth it Just for Don Knotts,"If I could split my review, I would give it three stars from an adult's perspective but--based on the reactions of my sons (9 & 11 years old)--five from a kid's. And I don't think it's just because we own a golden puppy.Unlike the previous movies, the dogs talk in this one. A couple of the puppies are really annoying when they talk (and will sound incredibly dated in about ... well, now), but the new conceit works pretty well for freshing up the series.The best part of the movie, though, was the pleasant surprise of hearing Don Knotts' voice one more time. He voices a (what else) deputy dog and it's like getting to listen to Barney all over again. Half expected him to call someone ""Ange""!Buy it for the kids, listen to it for the Knotts!"
2,Air Buddies,"My Grandson loves this movie but I had to stop letting him watch it because it models bad behavior, such as the villian ramming a stick onto a man's foot and shouting at him. My little guy started doing the same behaviour. I do not understand why children's movies have to model such lousy behaviour and the story line was not very good. I do NOT recommend this for toddlers."
5,Air Buddies,"If you love Golden Retriever puppies, and who doesn't, then this DVD is for you.The story is a continuation in the Air Bud series.In this DVD, Air Bud and Molly, start a family. Their new family consists of five beautiful puppies. There are four boys and a little girl.This story follows the pups through mischief, danger, and heroism, along with love and cuddles.It is a wonderful family movie. However, any Golden Retriever fan will instantly fall in love with the five little mischievous rascals and their quirky personalities!Trust me you'll fall in love with them."
5,"Best of the ""air bud"" series",The kids really liked this one - the adults found it is the best of the Airbud series. Would highly recommend.
3,Slow Start but quality family entertainment,We loved Spoke Buddies and thought this might be the same but alas it was slow to start and there were no cute songs like Spokey Buddies. My 6 year old liked it but it did not interest my 2 or 3.5 year old. Overall a good movie and it does tell the story of where the Buddies come from.
4,Great Christmas gift,"My daughter loves these dogs, and asked for this one for Christmas. They are all around cute stories and good for kids who are younger."
4,"Good, clean fun!",Quite imaginative and fun for everyone! I like the unique puppy names the writer chose. Keep the series of movies coming.
5,All ages,I think this is my favorite of the buddies movies. It is a good movie for all ages. One to sit down and watch with the kids on movie night.
3,Tom's DVD,Dirty with prints all over it scratched but plays.Came in a sleeve.Will Not buy again from this person.Spend the extra dollar and buy a wrapped one!!!
3,AIRBUDDIES,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER. I DID NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE AMD THEREFORE UNABLE TO SUBMIT A REVIEW.....SORRY
1,never watched it.,i didn't watch this movie. someone must be using my password. i need to change it because there ae oher movies i didn't watch.
2,"Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling","This is a very short book, with not much to it. It is okay reading but not my favorite."
3,it is to short and easy!,this game is cool when you first buy itbut then it gets very boring.I got the secrets very fastand if you are not fan of spider-man dont waste your $$$.
4,This is an O K Game,This Game has it's ups and its downs but if you are a spiderman freak i suggest that buy this game if your not it's not worth it.
2,looks good but lacks substance,"I had high hopes for this game on the PS2, but they were diminished after spening some time playing it. Sure, it looks really good, and the action is fluid and showcases the power of the PS2. But good looks don't make a good game. After playing for about 20 minutes I was bored with it. Plus the camera can't keep up with Spiderman's moves, and that creates a headache.Also, Activision, who wrote the script for that obnoxious training mode? The narrator deserves to get tossed from the highest building in the game."
3,Rent it First,It is pretty easy to beat the only hard leval is the last oneso i advise you to RENT IT FIRST before you wast your money
4,TIME IS EVERYTHING,"You want precise, professional customer service? this is the way to go.Very good with the time of delivery and the game was in great condition. I would definately consider using these guys for future buying possabilities."
3,Okay Fun but nothing new,"This game would be great, but it suffers from many things. 1-The camera [is bad]. 2- There are only a couple bosses. 3- Trying to unlock the Goblin is a real pain... 4- The game itself is extremely hard so its not really for beginning gamers. 5-The game is very short and there isnt much replay value besides unlocking Goblin..."
4,Wanna go for a spin?!?!,Reviewer: FatDaddythis game is cool. i play it a lot but i m stuck so i dont play much anymore. if u want a lot of action get kingdom hearts it is fun and has a lot of action with swords and i like pizza and chocolate. now go watch tellatubies because i like spongebob.
2,RENTAL ONLY,"This game seems unfinished. The graphics are terrible, the sound is forgettable, the gameplay is slow, the controls are clunky, the camera is horrid and the game is boring.Spend your fifty dollars on something better."
2,not very good...,"right off the bat, you see the main problem is the crappy controls. also the fighting feels like some cheap double dragon rip-off. i didn't get very far in this, because there are just so many better options out there."
4,A Start,"All I can say is, this game has alot of potential. The graphics aren't bad, but they won't win any awards. The gameplay when swinging through the cities is exciting but when Spidey hits the indor levels he gets ""less manueverable"". The camera angle can sometimes greatly affect the gameplay. Sound is ok, with Tobey Maguire voicing spiderman and william dafoe voicing the green goblin. Even though they have the movie actors for the voices, they sound like they aren't even trying. The game closely follows the movie, and it could use some more outdoor levels. As a matter of fact, the entire game should be outdoors. The fact is I enjoyed spiderman while it lasted, but it needs more umph. I'd say the next game (if they fix the flaws in this one)will blow off the roof."
3,Web Slinging,"Spiderman the movie game is a good game but it could be alot better. The graphics are quite good but badguys faces look a bit flat. It's movie graphics are sweet though. You have a wide range of moves which are really neat and you get moves by collecting golden spiders. The game follows the movie plot apart from some parts are taken out like the car chase scene which I think would be really cool to play and the warehouse, suddenly the crook has a whole army to help him out. It's good how they lengthened the game with badguys like Shocker and Vulture but the game could be much better."
3,Depends....,"I want to say this game is good, but unrealistic but i cant. first of all what does your web catch on to? sky? and (it might just be my TV) you cant see everything its so dark at some places. When you get stuck on somthing its really REALLY boring. I couldnt take this game over a week before i ditched it. I didn't even find fighting enemies with HUGE heads to fun. But when your the Green Goblin with a machine gun razor blades that freaking kill EVERYTHING it gets kinda fun i admit. I cant say its HORRIBLE but i cant say its good... If you get bored when your stuck get away from this game!!!"
4,Is It Really Worth $20,"Look it is not worth $20!! It is Boring!! Only 10 quick, and boring missions. When I went to sell it to Gamestop they only gave me $5 for it. Dont Buy!!!!!!"
3,It's an okay game!,It was a lot like the movie Spiderman and I was amused with those web crawling stuff and jumping makes me want to get The Hulk. I liked the previews before it it was just like watching the movie sort of. But the people in the game looked nothing like the actors like with Peter Parker he looked nothing like Tobey Maguire except maybe the eyes and somewhat of the skin they looked totally different but it does have the voices from the movie and everything it was a cool game and I enjoyed it.
4,"Good game, but not great.","Spider-Man was a good game. I enjoyed so much. But the only problem is that I beat the game in 3 days. So it is pretty easy. But besides that it is a good game. First the graphics are good and the sound is good. The gameplay is great, but it could be better. Overall I think that Spider-Man is good, but it needs just a little improvement."
2,Cool game but way too easy,"This game isn't that difficult at all but the graphics are definitely outstanding. Seems to follow the movie pretty well, also. This is definitely not one to buy. I recommend you just rent it."
3,"It's rated E for Everyone, but should be rated H for Hard!!!","Hello I'm a 14 year old gamer and the pictures are really cool looking and the abilities are neat, but it's really hard. There is a training part at first, but after that it gets tougher. Only on the first 2-4 levels you have to fight a bunch of Skull's gang and they have guns and everything. Sure you can go on the ceiling and stuff but they can find you easily if they already saw you on the ground. Each guy needs to be hit 4 times pratically and the webb power to tie them up doesn't last long if your hitting or kicking the guy(after 2 hits). I would suggest renting it first instead of just buying it because of the movie. Also, the moves are kind of hard to remember, too. Thank you for reading my review, hope it helps you."
5,Tons of web-slinging action,"Alright this game is awesome so let me put it in a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best scoreGraphics-10(Characters look so real)Sound-9(great voice acting and explosions etc)Fun value-10(you can websling up in the manhattan sky.Enough said)Gameplay-10(websliging,punches,kicking,climbing up walls,and you can tangle up your enemy with spidey's web blast)Overall-9(nobody's perfect)side comments-What did you think your only enemy is the green goblin? no way you have Shocker,Vulture,thugs,scorpian,green goblin,robots,spiders and more.For PArents-If your thinking about getting this game for your child it's rated E for Everyone(ages6+) just a little superhero violence no blood or curses so it's a good game for them.So if you want a fun experience get this game!"
4,"Great, but difficult","Spider-man, the movie of the year, but not quite the game. I personally own spider-man. When I first got it i thought it was going to be an awsome action packed adventurous game. in some ways I was right. If you're looking for a fun, difficult one player game buy spiderman.Pros:FunGaameplay and Graphics are greateasy to learncons:Hard to beat! player"
5,Best game for PS2 yet!,Great game a must have the control is a little hard to handle but who cares when you gave a great game like this I think you should have this gaame no matter what!!Graphics: 5.0 good graphics did you plaay this for PS1 if you did youll be suprised how much the graphics have improvedGame play: 5.0 this is not exactly like the movie which I saw and so should you but it is a great copy like the green goblin is in it and you look for the crook who killed your Uncle Ben
4,"OK game, but NOT 'E' rated","Have a 4 year old who watches the game play, thinking 'E' really means for 'Everyone'- to see people getting beat up or shot. Should be rated 'T'. The game itself is just OK. Agree with some of the other reviews- takes more than one hit to rid the bad guys. Spider-man??? more like Spider-boy..."
2,Spider-Man is Bad,Spider-Man is a stupid game. It is really boring and hard. Dont buy it unles you love Spider-Man. The controls are horrible too. I hate this game.
2,THIS GAME SUXS,I paid 50 bucks for this game and expected a lot more out of it it was stupid and short
4,Ish.,"Everyone got caught up in last years hype and bought this game. I did as well and realised it sucked. It's a mediocre action title with much more to be desired. Unless you must have it, forget it."
3,Gets boaring,Spider-Man is a good game but i think they could've done a better job. They should've made it so you could roam around and walk on the streets because you can't...
2,Well...,"Patient:Doctor,I feel enclosed in many levels.The first was okay with the free swinging action,but then,there was no room to fight,NO ROOM TO FIGHT!!!(sob)Peter would say things over and over again!I couldn't take it anymore!He wouldn't shutup!That is why I did it.That's right I broke the disk and I'm PROUD,PROUD, PROUD,PROUD.I WOULD DO IT AGAIN TOO! AND AGAIN,AGAIN!HAH,HAH,HAH HA!Police office:Whats wrong with him?Shrink:It seems he has 2 of 5 syndrome"
1,"Terrible, just terrible",Gameplay is disgraceful. Hard to control the character and plot of the game is just stupid.
2,OK but camera & controls ruin the game,"I liked the game for the most part but I got so irritated with the controls and the camera angles in the game that i just eventually gave up on it. I was getting into it but I would just get to frustrated. Ex: If you are pushing right to run with a side view and the view changes to behind, you would expect to rotate the control to forward to keep going straight (like in Mario 64) but doing that will cause you to run right until you let go and push forward again. This is majorilly irritating when being ganged up on by multiple people. The camera angle will almost never stay constant even when locked on and you just lose control of everything. I also wish you could be more sneeky and spider-like attacking villians. Once you hit someone, everyone in the area will come running. Also, give the villians a few more things to say or make them talk less. I REALLY wanted to like the game but had to many bugs. The Movie was great but the game needed a little more work"
3,a great game.....almost,"a great game except for spiderman's ""pause"" after he gets touched or shot, making it hard for a superhero to take out simple thugs......surely spidey should be tougher to bring down.great swinging graphics, would have loved to go ground level in city sections.also spidey sense should kick in during all dangers unseen.it is also hard to sneak up as soon as you hit someone, everyone around comes running, but i guess a more powerful spider man would not care. love the wise cracks, keeps true to the marvel character. well hopefully the ""bugs"" we'll be worked before my game comes out. peace"
4,Could have been better!,The only problem in this game is that after you beat it its boaring! It's defenetly good for a rental though. I beat it in about 3 hours with no cheats. The one on N64 is fun to. If you liked that one youll probably like it. And the gamecube version has better story lines and graphics.
5,SPIDER MAN IS BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the greatest games on the planet. Graphics 10, game play 10, story 10, and fun 10. I just love this game. When I got this game I thought it would be O.K. beacause I had never rented, borowed, or even played the game befor. So I bought the game with my Christmas money and I loved it. SO GET IT OR YOU WILL REGRET IT BUY IT NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Pretty Good, but way to short.","I rented this game. Its not a bad game. The graphics and levels are pretty good. To me, the fun factor rates pretty high on my scale. Overall, I give the game four stars; however, the game is awfully short and pretty easy too. I beat it in about 3 hours on normal mode. It was probably short because this game was of course, based on the movie. The bosses are very easy to beat. Goblin was way easier than I thought he would be as a final boss.My words to you gamers out there is; if you're one of those hardcore gamer types or just like to play games, rent this one. If you really love spider man, buy it."
4,the game is action -packed !Short but GREAT!,"The game is full of villians and 1 hero. if u love the spider-man comic series u will like it.the grapics are good but you get a little dizzy but you'll live.it's just like the movie except there's more villians including:{vulture,shocker, scorpion,and green goblin.}it took a little sweat but it's not challenging at all!you'll like it so much you think u really are the wall-crawler!!"
3,Spider-Man may be the best movie but not the best game,"The game isn't at all what i thought it would be. It gets kind of boring, with you doing the same thing over and over again. All you really do is kill the bad guys that come after you. It's not even challenging, it was really easy to beat and once you beat you won't have a desire to play anymore.The graphics are good, the camera can get annoying when it doesn't go the way you want it to, especially when your fighting an enemy. Areas can be way too dark to see where a bad guy is. Dialogue can get somewhat annoying sometimes because they repeat the same thing over and over. Gameplay is alright, but i've seen a lot better. If you want a superhero game don't get this one, it's not worth the money. Rent it first."
4,"Awesome, however not anything close to the movie!!","Spiderman is a great movie, engrossing the player into the shoes of Spiderman himself. However, on the downside, the game has no link at all with the actual ""Spiderman Movie"". For example finding Uncle Ben's assasian in the Game is a totally different ball-game than finding the assasain in the movie. The moves and the fighting is awe-inspiring. The camera angles can agitate the player on most ocassions, however this does not take away the ultimate charm of the game!!"
3,Rent before Buying,"I bought spider man based upon recommendations of other people. First of all, the game did have some great graphics and controls, but after the first few boards it got very repetitive. I found that boards mirrored each other and that the action was very basic and boring because the initial excitement quickly wore off. I quickly beat the game and the ending was lame. The game had a very weak story line. The best part of the whole game was the training mode which was voiced by bruce campbell. This is a good game if you buy it used for a cheap price or rent it. But overall, I found that it got really weak after the first few levels. This game was way to short. If you want a good game than buy Metal Gear."
5,its the best!,I'm so impressed how good it is. if you like spiderman get it. its the best. the gameplay is awesome the graphics are great and the soung it great!
4,I think it's cool...,I like this game a lot because the moves and graphics are awesome...but It is a little hard to get past about the fourth level :D but maybe that's just because of how bad I am at video games. I recommend this game. It's a lot of fun.. but I guess I do get bored from time to time considering how I can't get past a certain level..
2,Difficult and frustrating from the start,"Spiderman is sooo whimpy in this game. I wonder if the people who made this game know that in the comics Spiderman can bench press TEN TONS!!! You have to beat on a simple crook several times to get him to go down. That is so unlike Spiderman that it's absurd. What's worse, the bad guys often come at you in large groups, making them almost impossible to defeat.Each level gets progressivly more difficult, and more frustrating. I finally reached one level that had tons of traps and robots...I can't get any farther. That was the first day I had the game. I would strongly suggest renting this one instead of buying it if you must try it."
4,Spider-Man: Cool or Fool?,"This game was super awesome, but the game was too easy. The only thing missing was another level. It could have used another level. Finding those combos are hard. For those who are reading, here's a chaeat that enables all levels: ARACHNID Cool, huh? I give it an 8.4. But really, it requires skill and strong focus, but seriously, it could have used another level."
3,Room for improvement,"This game is pretty good but there's plenty of room for improvement. This game came out a couple years ago, and I was able to find a used one on sale for under $10. I got it and decided to see how it held up over time. The graphics are good - nothing to complain about. The voices are great - the actors from the movie do the voices for the main characters. Nice touch. The playability is so-so. Camera angle problems abound - you will find yourself running in one direction while manually moving the camera, but when you stop moving the camera you find you're going in a direction that makes no sense. Odd. The combat is so-so - Trying to kick someone in mid-air (boss fighting) while keeping your web-slinging up is near impossible. Hand-to-hand combat isn't very precise - you'll often miss hits. For under 10 bucks this game isn't half-bad, but I feel bad for you if you paid more."
1,Product is different than what is shown!,"I have used Bi-Odor with my ferrets since the beginning. I live out in the country and the closest store that carries it is seventy miles away and with gas prices being what they are, I decided to order it online. Mistake. What I received is something called ""Goodbye Odor."" It claims to do everything Bi-Odor does and since it is apparently also made by Marshall, I decided to use it. It has been about two weeks, now, I think. And my ferrets stink.I will NOT be ordering from this seller again. I'd sooner spend twice the price to drive to the city and back. At least then I'd get the product I want, the product that works!"
3,Players Club review,Talk about a slice of urban life Players Club has it all. There are indeed many a club in America that could easily fall into the same category as this urban inner city club.I don' want to sound sexist but one of the most memorable characters in the movie did not have a speaking line. I am talking about Demur. Ms. Demur is a professional stripper. I mean this girl has serious BOOTY! She could give Serena Williams a run for her money. When I first saw her from behind I thought she was wearing a prosthesis. Upon closer examination I realized that she was a natural. This girl gets more publicity from behind than in front. Remember Susan Summers first gained prominence in American Graffiti by merely riding around in a Pink Ford Thunderbird and smiling. So anything can happen. Whenever I think about the movie the Players Club I think about Ms. Demur.
1,The absolute worse movie ever made:(,"What were they thinking when they made this movie? The acting is bad, the dialogue is even worse and their is no discernible plot. If this is inpirational please give me expolitation any day."
1,total surprise!!!,"I recently purchased several dvds and while ive not had any issues with any other movies til opening this one, my surprise and dismay makes me hesitant to order again. Completely wrapped in the normal plastic wrap all the movies came in, last nite I stood in my living room to open The Players Club. I pulled off the plastic wrap, opened the case and inside found NO DISC! No movie. I couldnt believe it?!? How does that happen??? I have not even checked to see how and if i can return it, but thought i would share the experience. :( :( :( Sad i had to rate it with even one star!!!"
2,Like someone else said... Cult Classic!,"This isn't one of the best black films around, but it is a cult classic. Funny, and dramatic at times, the plot isnt' all that great but holds together a little better than some. Tired of seeing these type of movies though."
4,The greatest,"Ice Cube presented the audience with an in your face look at the consiquences of your decisions. I loved this movie not just for the beautiful women, but for being able to feel the actresses pain. We never really think of the problems and reasoning women sale themselves short. Life is hard, making bad decisions come regularly, but you must be able to look at yourself each morning."
2,Bernie Mac stole this picture,"In spite of the thin plot line and the volumptous semi naked women, the comedian Bernie Mac stole this picture! He played his part of the low life, club owning, hustler with perfect timing and high humor. He made this movie enjoyable to watch!"
4,A definite favorite,"I will never forget the first time I saw this movie. It awakened some primal urges in some places and in others left me caught up in the way life can play out when a girl gets caught up in the life. There were those characters who were well adapted to the life, those who were fitting in, and those that were overtaken by the allure moving a thousand miles a minute. Overall, the plot kept me interested and it is definitely a movie that I will watch over and over again."
2,O.k.,"This movie did show the life of a stripper. It was O.k. and had funny scenes, however I would never view it as a classic. I would never buy it for my collection either. I pass it everytime on the $8.88 walmart rack. There was a message in the movie (how the stripper was paying for college and trying to save her cousin from that life), yet it was barely noticed with all the sex, violence, and stupid comedy."
1,EXPLOITIVE AND RAW!!! WE WILL NEVER BE CONSIDERED QUEENS ..,"This movie made me sick....if this is how some of us act, we are in definite trouble as far as the black race is concerend. This movie showed me one thing: we black women are being totally exploited and we are allowing it. Sistas' wake up!! This is not they way to live. Ice Cube showed me that this is not the way....We need to take care of our female child better than this.....I like Ice Cube, but I can't support him on this one, especially the role he played! Must he always be the thug??? UGH!"
1,Awful,"This is one of the worst films ever. Avoid like the plague. Poor acting, Poor production, terrible story line. Just a very bad film."
4,"Bernie Mac was so funny, I like the movie","good movie........funny, funny, funny, good subject matter, ............ what more can I say, just a good movie, go Bernie Mac"
5,sexy movie,i love looking at pretty womens i like comedy i like black moviesi like the title to the movie and the stars who play it
5,Movie,I love this movie. I've seen it before but I still find joy in watching it over & over. This was a great purchase
1,no good!,This movie didn't even work!!! I tried it on a dvd player and a blu-ray and still nothing. I returned it.
4,Very good,"I really like this movie and wanted to see it, so thankful it was very cheap on Amazon and the quality was great"
3,Its Okay,"As a black woman, I really hate this movie because it makes black women look really bad. But I understand what Ice Cube was doing. This movie wasn't meant to win any awards, but it does try to give a message. That message was/is ""make the money, but don't let it make you"" or something like that. But with all the stripping, violence, cussing, and comedy its easy to lose track of the message. Plus, you don't get the message until the very end. Despite my feelings for this movie, Bernie Mac proved to me he is a genius in comedy. He made this film watchable (in my opinion). No doubt, this movie is for men only."
4,The bomb,I thought the movie was well written and very funny. Although at the same time it talked about real situations that actually are taking place in life.
1,"A crude, crass, and lewd directorial debut from Ice Cube.","If Ice Cube were as great a filmmaker as he is a rapper, then ""The Player's Club"" would have more to offer besides being a hip-hop flavored ""Showgirls."" Wishful thinking. The appealing LisaRaye stars as a struggling college student who abandons her part-time shoe salesman job to begin a life of a stripper. Along the way, she befriends another stripper and gets into all sorts of drama. The film's script is clumsy and never rises above the predictable and stereotypical. There's also a very unpleasant rape scene that's unnecessary as it is vile. Cube, I'm sure, wanted to ""keep it real"" by making this film as raw as possible, but in doing so, he forgot to ""keep it right"" by making a decent and believable film. ""The Player's Club"" isn't the worst film I've seen, but unlike ""Showgirls,"" it isn't bad enough to qualify as camp. It's just simply bad."
3,Pretty good movie.,"I liked how Diamond stayed strong and didn't give up when people down talked her about her job. Another thing I liked about the movie was that even though there was violence, at least nobody got killed. What I didn't like about the movie was how it degraded the women. But other than that, it was pretty good."
3,Great Message-A little bit extreme in the learning.,"I saw this movie and although it was a bit raunchy at times, it had a great message to it. I know the movie was trying to show what happens, realistically, in the strip club industry, but I think we could have been spared some of the scenes. However, the fight scene was just waiting to happen and I found myself pulling for Diamond the whole time :) Overall, a pretty good movie with an eventual positive message."
4,Good Directorial debut,"I thought the movie was well written by ice cube!! the only thing that was disturbing was the rape scene, other than that, it had a good story, funny lines and a half decent soundtrack. also a great cast including aj johnson playing little man, very funny!!!!!!!"
1,I wished there were an option to give half of a star,"Ice Cube needs to be slapped for directing such a horrible, exploitive, stereotypical movie such as this crap. And whoever wrote the script should never get close to pen and paper again!! It seems like for every underrated and classic African American movie,(Soul Food, Friday, Boomerang, Devil in a Blue Dress, Eve's Bayou, etc..) there's at least three awful, cartoonish and overhyped movies that features African Americans at their worst, ( Woo,Player's Club, Phat Beach, Baps, In Too Deep). Let's do better than this, filmmakers."
2,Corvair Distributor,"Mallory has a great name and a great reputation but, beware. This distributor is not supplied with a new drive gear or retaining pin. To make matters even worse the shaft isn't even drilled for the retaining split pin to secure the gear! Have fun drilling the shaft at the proper point. This is a job for a machine shop, so figure another $50, or more to have this done properly."
5,Tabjr,"I purchase this Distributor to replace the original stock ( Breaker Points ) system in my classic 1963 Corvair 110 hp w/ 4 speed manual x-mission( fully restored ) convertible...Now, the Automobile performs much better and runs more smoothly for a six cylinder flat rear mounted Engine.I also installed Electronic Fuel System at the same time which eliminated much of the sluggish acceleration I experienced with the mechanical fuel delivery systemsupplying fuel to the 2 one barrel carburetors.I have had NO problems with these MALLORY upgrade components and highly recommend them if you decide to up grade your Ignition system.Tabjr.....Happy Trooper"
5,best book out there on asperger's,"Dr. Ashley did a wonderful job of creating a well researched, up to date, easy to read and very informative book on Asperger's. I work in the clinical psychology field and Dr. Ashleys book is the best I have yet to read on Asperger's syndrome. I recommend this book to all without any reservations!"
1,tmi,There is just too much information in this book. I would not suggest it because it goes on and on and on about too many different things. Not good for a parent looking for help with a child.
1,Bad Writting,"This is a poorly written book. It paints a very black and white picture of Asperger's, when there is variation among individuals. The lack of proper citations is just poor writing. I could write pages on why not to buy this book, and about the possible validity of some of the information. The author writes about Theory of Mind as if it is a symptom or something of Asperger's. This may just be poor writing however. I could not get past this. Maybe some of the information is of use, but the delivery is just atrocious.I could not get past this to gain anything from the book.End of story, I returned the book."
5,Aspergers Book,Great book. Very informative. Will keep on my coffeetable to look at often and make reference to.
4,It works! That's what really counts.,I got the medium size for my 10 lb. yorkie. It works where nothing else did. A very smart investment in driving safety.
3,Lapdog restraint for Havanese,"Fits well on the seat. Easy to adjust. Dog hates it. Wants to be on a lap, which is his job. Bitterly complains and threatens union action. Makes drinking a cup of coffee possible for my passengers."
2,What a disappointment !,"An array of excellent dancers and what promised to be a superb DVD. However, the editing/camera-work is a tremendous let-down. Each dance is shot from many angles and shots change every two seconds. I've found I could not watch more than three dances at a time as my eyes felt like they were reeling in their sockets. When would the producers of these DVD/videos realise that the majority of people watching them are dancers who want to see actual dancing, not some clever camera tricks ?! Having said all that the dancers are superlative with Sadie and Isadora being exceptional."
5,"Beautiful photography, costuming & dancing, great on Blu-Ray","This is a really beautiful performance DVD filmed in a theater during a live dance concert. The backdrops, lighting, and close-ups of dancers' movements and facial expressions are truly lovely. The costumes are elaborate and lovely---cabaret, Pharonic-inspired, Persian, and more. Most of the music was from CDs. I particularly enjoyed the live music of a bass player and tabla player in some of the numbers, and that there was a good mix of modern music with traditional belly dance music. Also, this DVD upgraded really nicely when played in our Blu-Ray player---superior quality and detail on our Blu-Ray, although this is not a Blu-Ray disc. So, I would recommend this DVD in particular if you have a Blu-Ray player and are looking for belly dance DVDs that will upgrade well on it."
4,Pretty good,"The quality of the dancing as the videography is high, but there weren't enough dancers to make it interesting for the whole length of the DVD."
5,one of the best bellydance DVDs,"This DVD has excellent performances, stunning music and is technically perfect (not only two static cameras like in many other live shows, but 3 or 4 - one of them producing very good close ups of the movements and costumes). This is a rare example of a very good produced DVD, so good its perhaps even better to see this show on DVD than seeing it live."
5,It does what it should!,"I'm happy with all the features on this iron. It does everything it should without causing more problems. The retractable cord is great, though a little extra length would be nice."
2,Disappointed,I've been searching for a dark red shoe for some time and thought I had finally found it. When I finally received the shoe I was so disappointed with the colour. It is not red at all but a rich brown with a dark red heel! It's also a little big at the back.
5,Look great and comfortable,I like these shoes because of the square toe. It's very comfortable compared to pointed toe heels. I disagree that the sizes are off- I am a 9 and ordered an 8.5 and they are tight.
5,Style & Comfort,Comfortable leather shoes with sharp design and sturdy heel. A great addition to the wardrobe. Compliments both casual and formal clothing.
4,Very Comfortable,"These shoes are great. They do run a little big and I wish I had purchased a half size smaller. But other than that, they are good for all day wear."
1,Bose- Poorly designed and outclased by the competition,"Bose has earned its market share by advertising towards naive non-audio savy consumers. Universally reviled by the audio industry and audiophile, Bose products are designed and engineered for the ""lowest common denominator"".What this means is that the companies' parameters for design are focused on the Circuit City/Best Buy purchaser who knows little about audio standards and has seldom listened to higher end, but equally priced competitors.Don't waste your time on this garbage called Bose and ignore the sad ""self proclaimed"" audiophools who who think they're great. Audio engineers, speaker builders, designers and techs who work on audio equipement all know Bose is poorly made; so should consumers."
3,break too easily,"These are extremely comfortable headphones that I was proud to wear for a few days. The sound is more than I could ask for and everything was perfect. Unless you are the most careful person you know, don't buy these because in a few days I know they will break and the super glue will have to be taken out. I have been snapping mine all over the place and finally that is not possible anymore. Now they have actually broken and now the duck-tape is out, and I felt like telling some people that these things break very easily. But dont get me wrong- very nice, good-quality headphones."
2,"Good enough sound, but breaks readily & can't be repaired","I like the sound fine, but the headphones have a couple of ways of breaking: where the over-the-head plastic joins the u-shaped yoke attached to the earpiece, and where the earpiece mount pivots in the over-the-head plastic. They're just too cheaply and flimsily made. Nothing like seeing $150 bite the dust just because of some broken thin plastic parts. :("
1,Extremely flimsy and not worth the money,"I bought a pair of these headphones and after only 2 weeks the headband broke on both sides. The size extenders are apparently held together by only a STAPLE!!!Yes the sound quality is great, but the construction quality of these headphones is simply unforgiveable.If you don't believe me go to a chain electronics store (Best Buy, Circuit City, etc.) and look to see if they have one of these on display. I guarantee you that the display model will be broken.The people that give these headphones a high rating, 4 or 5 out of 5, simply have not owned these headphones long enough or used them enough to see a problem. If you own these headphones for a few weeks they will break just like mine, and believe me, you will want a refund.Just as a last point of advise; If you do buy these headphones, buy them from a physical chain store, not an online store. It will save you the effort of having to send them back through the mail for a refund."
1,Poor Design,"The headband broke in 2 places after a few months of usage. Even though the sound you hear is fairly good, it is not worth the money."
2,"Good Sound, Poor Contruction","I love the Sound of these headphones but after a year of use. I merely placed them on my head and snap. The plastic used snapped. I agree with many of the reviewer. The sound quality is great, but what good does sound quality do if the phones break with no fault but putting them on and off. I take care of my phones, I don't drop them. Bose needs to make this wrong right and reconstruct the head bridge on these phones. These phones should be taken off the market until Bose corrects this problem. Just count the review on this site alow and 1/3 complain of cheap construction because the headset breaks. It just a matter of time for the others usally a little over a year and the phones self destruct. Just long enough for the warranty to end. You would expect better quality from a company that prides itself on the best."
2,good sound quality but very fragile,"anyone considering buying these headphones should be aware that they are very fragile. the speakers themselves are sturdy enough but the plastic in the band holding the two speakers together is very fragile. i bought a pair even after having heard that they are fragile thinking the person reviewing them may have been careless w/ them but mine have broken two times when i was doing nothing more than taking them off. the plastic on these things is barely strong enough to hold them together. that being said, they do have the best sound quality of any headphones i've ever owned. they are also the most expensive headphones i've ever owned."
1,Headset Broke after 6 months!!!,"I had reservations about buying this headset from the beginning. It had $$$ price tag and they're not even active noise canceling.After I bought the headset I was even more concerned seeing the poor reviews on the internet due to manufacturing defects and poor design. I ended up being quite happy with the sound quality and have had no major issues until today.Now, as I wait on hold for the Bose service department to answer my call, I write this review. Too bad, the left headset snapped off while I pulled the unit onto my ears...I didn't drop them or pull very hard... it just snapped the sheer pin clean off. Oh well, next time I'll read the reviews first. Don't buy this one... move on to a better quality headset."
3,Can't wear them for long,"I found these to have reasonable to excellent sound for the price. They are lightweight and give good bass response with no degradation to the mid and high tones--although the high tones can be a bit ""bright"" for my tastes. My biggest problem with these phones is that after I wear them for 20 minutes or so they begin to get very uncomfortable, making my head and ears ache."
2,Not worth the money.,I listened to these and the bass is way too deep.Feels like youre gonna fry your ears.Even if you set the bass to the middle it still sounds like bad.Trust me if you want a great product from this company just buy the Wave Radio youll be much happier.It is almost indistinguishable from my expensive Sony stereo and the speakers sound just as good if not better than my SSMB200H bookshelf speakers.That is a high peak in technology and worth the money.These headphones are horrible though.
3,Snap,"I agree completely with the bottom review from Berkeley. I'm sure we're talking about the same break-site. I've reglued my headphones twice in the same area where the plastic-covered metal band connects to the earpiece, and due to the tension in the band they keep snapping whenever I put them on. These are not for mobile-users; they are simply too fragile. With that said, I can agree that the sound is amazingly rich."
1,"Great Sound, Pathetic Quality overall","You spend 150 bucks for these headphones and they dont last even a year!!!!!!Dont waste your money! Buy them only if you you have a very ""small"" head which does not demand the headphones to be built sturdy!"
1,"Paid $79, but still returning",I got them at our local target for $79 due to torn packing. I am no audio expert but these sound so murky as compared to my Er6i and EX71 buds that the term muddy bass suddenly becomes crystal clear after this comparison. Try the PX100 for third the price.
2,"If you use them alot, don't buy them","I bought my triports when they first came out. I listen to them every day at work and within the first week, I broke both sides. I called bose and they said they hadn't had any problems but told me to return. I did and the second pair did the same thing. A little scotch tape and they worked fine for over a year. Now I just snapped off the left ear piece. Maybe I have a big head but I definitely don't abuse these headphones to a point where they should break so easily. Great sound, bad engineering. Next headphones will definitely not be the triports."
2,Sound good but cheaply made,After a year they started falling apart. All of the leather around the speaker started falling off and then the cloth split allowing the foam to come out.
5,Phenomenal Headphones,"OK, I'm not a studio technician or an audio expert, but I DO know that I am completely picky when it comes to the ""sound of music"" .. that said, I tested a LOT of headphones before deciding on the Bose Triport's.The sound is incredible, and the noise reduction is also significant, even though these are not ""noise reduction"" headphones. When I am listening to music on them, I cannot hear anything BUT the music, which is great. They also reduce engine noise on planes.All in all, a great product with amazing sound. Well worth the investment, especially if you are one of those people who, like me, has to have music sound ""just so"" in order to be pleased.PS - I use mine with my Dell DJ MP3 player, if that matters."
2,Sound is Fantastic / Build Quality is Bad,"I bought these headphones long before most knew about them. The quality of the sound from the headphones is just amazing. The clarity and depth of the sound from these headphones makes me want to keep the headphones on all day.The biggest and perhaps the only problem with these headphones is plastic that holds the headband together. There is a huge design flaw that causes these things to eventually break due to excessive fatigue on a certain region. I've gone down to the Bose store and have had a goodwill replacement on-site. I thought it could be the way I was handling the headphones, so I stopped taking them out with me. A month later, they broke again at the exact same spot. I called Bose about it. Over the phone, the Bose representative tells me that the design flaw has been fixed. She sends a replacement, which I just got today. It looks EXACTLY the same as my previous two sets. I would suggest waiting until this is redesigned."
2,Overpriced and Fragile,"I bought these headphones after hearing them at a Bose store in a shopping mall. I hadn't had anything much to compare them to except earphones that come with portable players and they sound much better than that. However, you can get the same or better sound from headphones that cost far less. I recently bought a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 headphones to take to the gym... They are also more comfortable. The Bose Triports have a flimsy plastic headband which has broken three times in nine months. Bose cheerfully replaced them each time but I now must use the headphones gingerly and after hearing the Sennheiser PX 100 I prefer to use the Sennheiser. The Bose sound nice but you can get better value for your money elsewhere. Bose did, however, introduce me to better sounding headphones. I just wish I had done some comparison shopping before I plopped down my money for the Bose headphones."
1,Rate as -10: Handle with EXTREME care.,"I am very careful with all my belongings and have had my headphones at the office, have never dropped them and only put them on at the most 10 times, and they broke in 3 places (impossible to tape back together because the left earpiece fell off!). I'd rate these as a -10 for quality and construction. The sound, however, I would rate as a +5!"
1,Triport are Junk,"My experience is POOR! I purchased the product for quality sound and I do love the sound, however the Engineers at Bose Corp. should be fired! I loved the sound of my first pair so much that I purchased my second set of head phones - shortly after this my nightmare began. In a year and a half, I have had to send both pairs of Triport headphones back to Bose Corp. and not just once but twice! This product is JUNK, but it does sound good. I urge anyone who has purchased a pair, to send them back if they can because eventually they will break. I also urge anyone who has a pair that is broken to send them back. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT"
2,I'm not sure this book is as useful as the reviews I read claim.,"I suppose as a very general overview it might be useful. Third Reich Militaria is a very vast field. A detailed handbook would probably be more like the Oxford English Dictionary than a 'handbook.' Still, much of the information about values seems somewhat outdated based on my research. I guess overall it's not a bad book, just FAR too small to be very useful to a collecter. You will definately need other material to supplement this book, no question."
5,Laugh In Your Pants Funny,"The 411 by Maria:This is one of those shows that makes me wish I still live with my sister. Watching Bob and his family especially his wife Linda voiced by John Roberts. Too funny. She reminds me of so many members of my family. ""Bob-by""You definitely need a sense of humor to thoroughly enjoy this show. I love laughing and Bob and his family are hysterical.Bob sells burgers. He has a really crappy location (next to a funeral home), his kids are inappropriate. Tina is too sexual and has many inappropriate dreams which she has no problems discussing with her family. Gene has noise makers that get him in trouble (fart and sex noise) and Louise is t-r-o-u-b-l-e but the brains behind the whole family. Love her and her bunny ear at. Through it all, Bob remains always optimistic.This is a must see for people who don't take themselves too seriously and love to laugh."
3,Maddeningly Inconsistent,"""Bob's Burgers"" is from many of the writers and producers who were behind the previous hit comedy ""King of the Hill"", so I was expecting a similar quality series. What irks me is, that for every great episode, there are about three or four others that turn out to be duds. One of the worst episodes in this set was ""Crawl Space"", in which Bob stays behind the walls of his restaurant to avoid seeing the grandmother. And what's with ""Bunny Girl""? Does Little Louise have to wear those annoying rabbit ears in every cartoon? Finally, what is it with Tim/Tina? He/she dresses as a girl, but has the distinct mannerisms of a boy, such as a male voice and facial hair. Are children too young to be exploring the issues of transgenderism, especially when they watch this show?"
2,ugh,this is just another bad show to fill up a spot on fox i mean the story line is horrible and the character are just bad. Its a bad mix of character. and its not funny at all.
2,H. Jon Benjamin can do Better...,"...oh wait, it's called Archer! Seriously though, I only watched this thinking ""yay! a new prime time cartoon to try out besides the Simpsons and Family Guy."" Welp, it sucked. Every episode I tried watching just sucked and was very dry on the humor. Besides the main attraction here, voices are really bad, especially the wife's. Animation is equally terrible too with it looking just plain ugly. I mean there was nothing creative or quirky here to keep my interest till I change the channel every time it came on. After you watch Archer where H. Jon Benjamin truly shines as great and humorous voice actor, Bob's Burgers becomes a very stale left over McDonald's burger left on the warmer all day.I would rather watch the live action Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode over Bob's Burgers any day."
4,"After all the plots, i like it","This show started out with a horrible pilot. It made the show look dumb, and the first few episodes were. Then season 2 came! It was like a new show, funny and orignal take on life. It actually is a very good show"
5,This is a brilliant show!,"This arrived instantly, plays perfectly, and makes me smile. Sometimes I am far from the internet. Having a video or two to watch at such times can be useful - especially one so entertaining!"
4,Holy Cow...what a life!,BMD is one hell of a guy and now you too can learn what he has went through in an incredible life. This book is well worth every penny and hey...buy the book or the blind man dies! Read the book you will understand!
5,"Outstanding shipping, packaging and quality of product.","Kirby vacuum cleaners are the best on the market. I was really surprised as to how quickly I received the product and how neatly packaged it was. I used the cleaner the day I received it and I noticed a major difference in the way it cleaned the carpet. My wife also noticed the difference in the texture of the carpet when we finished. Finally a quality product that is worth the investment. I remember my mom using a KIRBY and still has it today and thats been over 20 years +. Again, great product and great services. Kudos to SARAS VAC SHACK for quality service,"
5,the best vacuum for the money,"I had heard good things about Kirby vacuums from several of my friends, but I couldn't part with $2000 for a new one. I bought a G4 reconditioned a few months ago, and my carpets looked like new after one use. In five years, I have gone through three bagless vacuums bought at the store, and they left my carpets dirty. So buying a reconditioned Kirby is the ideal situation. You get the wonderful quality of Kirby at a reasonable price. I haven't used the attachments; I use a shop vac for furniture and draperies. I estimate this Kirby to be at least 20 years old, and it runs better than a new bagless vacuum."
5,Built like a tank,17 years ago I actually sold this vacuum I was 18 years old and new it was like $1600.00. Of course the only person that bought it was my grandmother lol. Anyways she ended up giving it to me when I got my first house and it has been with me since. I can tell you with 100% certainty this will clean deeper than any store bought vaccum as the motor is much stronger it is also very versatile as a shampooer or with multiple hand attachments. The big downside is locating replacement bags as you most likely need to go to a Kirby dealer to get them. Still works strong 17 years later I highly reccomend this.
3,alchemy of illness,This is a fairly good book for someone facing a chronic illness but is a bit hoeky if you ask me.
5,Vogue's Revised Excellent Product,This item provides clearly defined illustrations in light blue shading where appropriate. It is a current revision of previous issues with timely updates for decades of styles as reference. It is a pleasant reading experience for those already with excellent sewing skills.
4,The ones that work with our twins.,"I love these, we bought them on clearance and haven't been able to find them since. But with our twins they are the only ones that worked!"
5,Cork Grease.,"I understand about the other reveiwer means aboout the viscosity of the grease, however at the end of the day it really doesn't matter (in my opion) since what it is there for is to help the peices slide together and this does the job. Sure it may not be the high end grease, but it does the job just fine."
4,Used on Saxophone...worked fine,My son uses this on his tenor saxophone and it does what it should. He mainly uses this to keep his mouthpiece lubed up otherwise it gets stuck.
3,Undecided,Currently not sure that I like the viscosity of this brand of cork grease. Will continue to use and evaluate. I have used Selmer and Buffet cork greases before using this one.
5,"As described, prompt delivery","Was a little worried at first because the sticker on the inner package said this was for a different vehicle (can't remember what vehicle) but I think it's just compatible with both and more popular with the other vehicle. (I have an '03 Suzuki Grand Vitara, hard to find parts for those things, and not very common) But of course it was just what I needed, and other than my cheap plastic Suzuki dash cracking and falling apart during installation, all went well. Easy to find and reasonable price on this, easy to use and install, prompt delivery."
2,Not Good,"When it arrived,most of the black design was chipped off.Also,The box it was shipped in was huge and I had to struggle to get it from the mailbox."
2,It doesn't last long,"I loved the bracelet, but it was very fragile. The bending made it break. I only lasted for about two months."
2,disappointed,"Although this bracelet looked beautiful online, I was disappointed in it when I received it. It didn't look as impressive and the peuter is so soft that it easily bends out of shape. I really wanted to be happy with it because I love the celtic design. Alas, it was not what I had hoped for. Would not recommend it."
5,Just as described...,"VERY nice piece. Just as ""Sky"" in Tucson said, much heavier, sturdier, and more impressive than I would have thought. I'm delighted with it, and you can't beat the price!!"
5,edward payson,thank you so much for putting the work of payson on kindle. these sermons are great. clear and convicting and powerful. all christians should know and love payson. I hope you print on kindle his complete works. i look forward to it. thank you
3,Can not dispute the recipes ...,"Quite honestly dessert recipes from the people at Cooks Illustrated are my flat out favorite. What ever they do, I believe they are some of the best that you will try. Their chocolate chip cookies are delicious and about as close as to a wonderful bakery as you are going to get. This series of books disappoints me. Think the size of a large postcard, that is going to be the size of this book, its not thick either. The Dessert Bible would be a better choice many more recipes than what this has at not a great increse in price. I am disappointed at the lack of content in this boo. Great recipes, but not a great price."
2,I kept waiting for something culturally innovative,"I agree that this book appeared targeted at a specific group of people. Unfortunately I found myself at times feeling like I was reading an infomercial presentation full of many insightful, informative concepts with little or no method for inner growth. I was hoping for a book with insights into how to get to this ""T"" zone in some manner other that ""ten visits"" to a healer. Mesher's books claims to be ""a book about inner growth"", but it is a book about his observations and insights based on his work with ""clients"". Unfortunately you can't get to this ""T Zone"" without the 'healing' touch, and touch, and touch, and touch...This may bring luck to those people who work with him. There is nothing new here for the well-read reader of occult or New Age books. It read more like a litany of symptoms that a good healer can treat, instead of a list of steps to transcendence."
3,Nice book for early baby boomers,"Alan touches on universal truths. Very inspiring and appropriate for those born under Pluto in Leo, 1946-1957. Later born groups (me and several friends) find the message rather ""old foggie"" and ""Com'on, man what's the big deal? We already know that. Lets get down to the business of really opening up consciousness!"" Good work for sure. Better yet when the message is tailored for specific age groups. Its rather entertaining to see this group squirm and gather to ""find themselves"" when their grandchildren (Pluto in Scorpio, Sagitarius) are born already knowing. Thanks Alan. You've got the technique, seek the timing."
2,"Performance great, production awful","Great performance, band was tight and material well covered by Wilson. Glad I purchased it (elsewhere and slightly cheaper) but in reality it should be sold for no more than $10 due to its awful production. Looks like an old VHS tape converted to DVD. Audio is not true surround sound. Audio probably gets 3 stars. Video only 2. As a completist I am happy to have it and will continue to watch it as I like the Wilson era Genesis. Only wish Genesis could have cleaned this up and included it in the new boxset. If you are a die hard fan and must have it, buy it but dont expect much of the video. If your not a die hard, pass on this."
2,Just ok,"This is not an official Genesis product. The video was captured during their tour in Poland with frontman Ray Wilson (who replaced Phil Collins at the time). One disc is average and the other has terrible sound and video quality. The double-CD offered has the audio extracted from the DVD so you'll find same issues. Price is high, expectations were also high but once on my DVD player I felt I was robbed."
2,Felt let down,"There is so little film of Genesis after Phil Collins left, I was looking forward to this concert.I have no idea who actually released this, but to be frank it's embarassing. The sound and video quality flipsfrom 'reasonable' to something on par to a kid doing a sneaky recording of something on their mobile phone !!!I am glad to have it as part of my collection, but feel that the overall production quality wasa complete let down on a commercially available DVD.."
1,Worst Picture Quality,"I love GENESIS, but who authorized the quality of this DVD. Unwatchable. Quality is the worst I have ever seen.. VHS 220i sd quality."
1,RIP OFF,"I bought this hoping it would be a professional release. I've seen better quality bootleg concerts on VHS. I've become a Ray Wilson fan over the years. So at the very least, it's good to at least see the performance of Ray with Genesis. Shame the quality had to be so poor."
1,MOVIEMARS SELLING BOOTLEGS / AMAZON ALLOWING IT,"MOVIEMARS SOLD ME THIS DVD THAT AMAZON IS REVIEWING AND I TOOK A CHANCE. DVD 2 WAS BAD AND FROZE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF ""MAMA"" AND THESE GUYS WOULD NOT REPLACE THE BAD DVD. THEY ARE CARRYING BOOTLEG MATERIAL THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OFF EUROPEAN TV WITH CALL STATION LETTERS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER THROUGHOUT MOST THE CONVERT AND NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH CUSTOMER SUPPORT AS THEY SHOULD. I WONDER IF AMAZON SUPPORTS BOOTLEGS? I GUESS THEY MUST OR WHY WOULD AMAZON ""NOT SELL IT"" BUT ALLOW MOVIEMARS TO? I GUESS IF AN INDEPENDENT SELLER HAS 5-6 DIGIT FEEDBACK THEY ARE IMMUNE FROM FOLLOWING THE RULES. I OPERATED AS AN HONEST SELLER AND BECAUSE MY SON 2000 MILES AWAY MADE A MISTAKE THEY CLOSED MY SELLER ACCOUNT WITH OVER 4000 POSITIVE FEEDBACKS AND LESS THAN 2% NEGATIVE RATING. LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE NOTED, THIS IS A BOOTLEG PRO SHOT TAKEN FROM EUROPEAN TV AND STILL OK AS THERE IS NOTHING BETTER FROM THE RAY WILSON ERA OF GENESIS."
4,Excellent coverage of major programs,"I enjoyed the insightful comparisons between these packages. However, the biggest drawback is that this book doesn't cover the most recent versions of the software, but it a version behind."
2,Not a Good Book,"This book doesn't strike me as being useful to anyone. It is a reference book, and not by any means a COMPLETE one. At times it tells really simple things that you would find out just by looking at the program. Like when I just started flipping through the book, it says 'Editing layers - saving'. now i'm not sure, but that doesn't seem like something that you would not assume, ya know? It is an okay book, but the only reason i can see someone buying it is to save money from getting 3 seperate books, but no one would need only this book. Just get the Photoshop, Illustrator, and Painter Wow Books, they're much more worth your money."
5,Wendy Knows Her Stuff...Wonderful Concept and Execution,This is a truly great book; much better than other books I've read on Illustrator alone. The fact that it covers Photoshop (and Painter) as well is a bonus.
4,Adds depth to an already great game!,"Sega Bass Fishing is a great game. Adding the fishing controller brings a new dimension. Feels a bit more like fishing this way. Yeah, it's nothing compared to the full arcade version where you have to fight the ""fish"" tugging on your line. But this home controller comes in a close second for the fun rating. Vibrates when you have a fish on the line, but strength of vibration doesn't change based on the size of the catch (too bad! , but still fun anyway). If you enjoy the fishing game then I highly recommend getting the Fishing Controller."
2,You call this fishing?,"Well, where did Sega come up with this? The rod is uncomfortable and has a very unreal feel when bass fishing. Most of your movements arent even sent to the game, giving the user not much to work with. You would think that if there was a fish on your line the reeling would get stonger, but it doesn't, the only thing this controller does is vibrate. I prefer the regular controller over this worthless piece of plastic. DO NOT SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS!I am yet to try the rod made by InterAct (I believe that's the other manufacture) So I am not going to comment on that one."
4,The Dreamcast Fishing Controler,The dream cast equipment was much better than the knockoff's. There are fewer problems and it lasts foever. I purchased a madcats version in 1996 and it died after only about a year; The Dreamcast F.Controler I purchased new in 1998 is still going strong today(2008)
5,Excellent collection of short stories,"A very enjoyable reading experience; a broad range of characters and plots, most a bit on the darker side of life but some happiness and sunshine mixed in for flavor. I recommend this book to anyone with a touch of macabre to their sense of humor, or a reader looking for something a few steps off the beaten path of so many standardized plots."
4,Standard Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Fare,"This DVD has 5 episodes about 25 minutes each, standard Mickey Mouse Clubhouse fare. My 2 year old loves Mickey and the gang and this is another good DVD to add to our collection. We like the Clubhouse DVDs because she has actually learned a lot from them (they do a lot of things with numbers and patterns and such). In fact it is the only thing we allow her to watch besides Veggietales as it's one of the few remaining wholesome, good, clean fun programs out there and it's a great bonus that it's educational too!"
5,Mickey Mote,"My grandkids LOVED the Micky Mote - they've wanted one all year and Santa finally found it. Set up very simple, works well.Money well spent"
2,All episodes that are on TV,"My son doesnt like this at all and he loooovvveeess Mickey, like he hears mickey's voice and stops whatever he is doing, but for some reason he doens't really like these episodes, and I must admit I'm not too fond of them either. Maybe because the are frequent re-runs on TV? but he does love Road Rally, Mission to Mars and Choo Choo express and Adventures in wonderland and the included episodes."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Mickey is wonderful in Mickey's Great Outdoors. I tried to purchase it from another site, and this was the cheapest. I highly recommend it. My son is entertained and loves the ""Jungle Pete"" episode. Great for little Mickey Fans!"
3,Don't buy for Mickey mote but for the DVDs,"I read all the reviews about the Mickey Mote not working and still decided to take a chance and buy it. Although our Mickey Mote didn't work, I was able to ""sync"" it to our personal DVD remote and use the interactive option that way. Be warned that of the 5 episodes on the DVD, only the first episode has the interactive option. However, the product is still a good value considering you get 5 episodes (whereas with other children's compilations it's usually 4) AND the digital copy. Just the DVD by itself is still entertaining."
5,KIDS LOVE,MY DAUGHTER LOVES MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE. AND THE MICKEY MOTE HELPS KIDS BE INTERACTIVE WHILE WATCHING THE SHOW. WILL RECOMMAND.
2,Disappointed,"The dvd itself is great, but the ad clearly states that it includes a digital copy which I was counting on. Turns out that the ""code"" was not included so cannot download. Very disapointing."
5,wonderful recipes for fresh produce,"Wholesome, healthy recipes for fresh produce from your garden or orchard. Have had this book for years, but purchasing for family who requested it for Christmas."
5,Great Recipes To Get You Eating Healthy,"This cookbook is offered as part of a subscription to the Rolling Praire CSA and a co-worker who belongs to it loaned it to me. I wanted to purchase this cookbook locally but couldn't find it, so I ended up purchasing it from a Amazon reseller. Paid way too much but it is well worth it. The recipes in this cookbook are categorized by vegetable/herb and are mostly vegetarian. Meat could easily be added though. The recipes are simple, tasty and unique. They don't call for exotic ingredients like truffle oil or spices that I would only use for one dish. I am not a big vegetable lover but the recipes in this book are making a convert of me. The desserts are really nice as well. I am an experienced cook with a boatload of cookbooks but this is one cookbook that I will reach for over and over again."
5,Great deal on a great game,"Over 12 Hrs of Gameplay ,what a great deal. I found Blowout to be a great chance to go back to the days of no nonsense, no story, just kill everything games that we grew up with. The company that made it is the same ones that did BloodRayne and Roadkill and it really shows that they have some talent. I also wanted to mention that my Blowout box has a TEEN rating not mature as it says on this site."
5,love it,"im a huge fan of arcade type shooting games and this one is pretty fun! doesnt compare to doom but all n all id say its worth it. graphics are about what you would expect for an arcade game,and of course theres not a huge range of movement or action. good selection of unlockable guns and a long enough story line to have lots of fun."
1,Lame,"I bought this game thinking it would be an awesome side scroller, but boy was I wrong. The controls suck, the graphics of the creatures suck, and the game is flat out borring. Thank god Game Stop let me return it and get my $7.00 back that I originally paid for it used. When will a awesome side scroller come out?"
2,Mario in Space,"The game is a basic shoot'em up with lousy aiming and in two dimensions. Reminds me of the old Mario Brothers...up and down, left and right. Boring."
5,Contents,"Crackle Weaveby Mary E Snyder1989 Revised EditionThis is the revised edition and includes 90 projects with complete worksheets.[threads used, treadling, threading, etc]"
4,Gorgeous but runs small,"Love these boots! Got them yesterday and have been prancing around the house, admiring them and myself in them. They are stylish, the leather is of nice quality and the rubber sole is practical.But, they run a wee bit small in the foot. And they're tight in the calf. I'm big but not obese by any means. I'm tall, and they only come to mid-calf on me."
1,Blowout? No it just blows,"Thought this would be a fun old school 2D scroller. Well its a scroller at least. Jerky game play that is disrupted by an off camera voice. It really tries to add depth and plot to what should be a shoot em up. Yeeeessh, unless you're in the market for a DVD coaster or simply need a gag gift, avoid this one."
3,Useful - and that's about the extent of it.,"I've been confident w/ buying Lexar equipment for some time now, and this CF reader does what it says. Writing and reading data appears to be relatively fast - important when I need to transfer data quickly in my job. The heavy duty plastic holding case is also nice because it does travel with me. The negative comes in for product manuals and help. The manual is essentially useless if you have any questions beyond basic installation. I had a quick question about this product and placed a call to the Lexar tech line - and was repeatly told to format my card no matter the description of the problem or the question I had. And this was the standard response of the three different techs I talked to."
4,good quality. fast but not fast enough.,"1. well built.2. Fast speed. 10M byte/s read, 6M bytes/s write.Much slower than Firewire."
2,Speed similar to usb2.0/firewire=not good enough,"The company's literature for this product states that it has speeds ""similar to usb 2.0 and firewire."" That does not cut it for me at this price point. I understand it is more portable, etc; but you can get a usb 2.0 reader that uses no cable for much less. If you really need high transfer speeds you're going to want to go with a new firewire 800 reader and pc card that adds between 2-3 ports. They transfer at 40MB/s, of course dependent on your CF card. You would think that with a direct, 60-something pin connection adapters such as these would be the fastest things going... seems like it is not the case."
4,"It's better than the other ones, but not perfect","It's all realtive to your hand size. I've got big hands and it is a bit small for me, but for others it might be just fine. It's not too heavy, unlike the bat-a-rang sliver one with six buttons, which was a fair bit heavier. The triggers are not idealy placed and the action buttons could be a bit bigger for my taste, but compaired to the others on the market, this one is best one at the moment."
3,Sega standar controller,I recently purchased this item and have found that all though it rocks it has an obvious blunder. The cord! The cord design for the new Sega controllers is just out of place and in the way. I find that the placement at the bottom of the controller just does not work very well. The cord has to bend coming out of the controller and it makes for touching your hands. If you are a hard core serious gamer you will defiantly find this annoying. Also I have noticed that when my sister plays it sometimes she mistakenly can not keep her hands of the lower trigger button and struggles to find a grip which is comfortable to prevent this. Although this is not a problem for me it is an extreme frustration for he since it often causes her to unwittingly change camera views at curtail bad times in game play.Awesome idea! Designers debacle!
5,In laws would be Proud,"Very prompt, polite note sent, would recommend a purchase from this point anytime"
1,What was Sega Thinking?,"This controller has to be one of the worst out on the market. It has a horrible design, is made of cheap plastic, and to make matters worse, it's also highly priced. Don't even think about using it for games like Marvel Vs. Capcom, because even casual play will break this controller. If you're serious about games, find an import controller made by another company. Don't even bother with the other Dreamcast controllers out in America, they are all just as bad, if not worse."
1,This controller STINKS!,"I used this controller and it stinks. The grips are too deep within the controller, making your fingers need to really hook in. This leads to INCREDIABLE discomfort and lack of playing enjoyment, because you need to keep your wrists too close together."
1,very poor for accurate games,"This controller is as awkward as it looks. It works somewhat for games like Crazy Taxi, even though my hands hurt from the awkward positioning of the hands on the unusual shape of the controller. Then for games that require accuracy like SF Alpha 3 and Marvel vs Capcom, it's useless. It's completely impossible to do exact controller motions, and you can't press 3 buttons together for a super since you never know at what point the trigger will ""count"" the button press. Go find a PSX pad converter, it's worth it..."
1,Absolutely horrible,"Worst game controller since the Intellivison. It's uncomfortable, the triggers have to travel too far to be effective in fast-twitch games, and the 4 buttons are too far apart. But mostly it just makes your hands rest in an severly unnatural position.Someone is developing an adaptor that will let you use a Playstation controller. Get it."
2,Bad design - hurts your hands,"I don't see how people can even compare this controller to the Dual Shock or the N64 controller. The lack of buttons makes playing 6-button fighting games difficult, even more so since the L & R buttons are triggers. It is difficult to hold a solid grip on the controller and after playing just 30 minutes of Soul Calibur, the tips of my fingers began to hurt. If you're thinking about getting that second controller, I do not suggest Sega's (or even the competitions'). Wait for a decent controller to hit the market."
1,misleading company,do not buy for this company they will charge you for 1 thing and give you somthing else. i'll never shop here again
5,dont need to pause for rest!!!,"at first when i SAW the dreamcast controller... i was like...""it looks kinda weird."" BUT after i bought the dreamcast... played games on it.. i was like ""HEY! I dont need to shake my hand off with this thing."" My point is... the Dreamcast Controller doesnt hurt ur two pointing fingers like the playstation and super nintendo controller do. I can play with the DC controller for hours! whoever made this controller was BRILLIANT!but if u are used to playing playstation... the buttons are TOTALLY OPPOSITE... the A button where u would think the x button is... so u got to get used to the buttons first.. took me about 4 days."
5,"Good Design, Well Made","The Sega Dremcast controller has received alot of mixed reviews, some saying it is uncomfortable to hold or that its hard to use for certain game genres, etc. All i can really say it this: these controllers are incrediably well made and designed. It basically improves on the N64 controller in every-way, and makes the gaming experience more enjoyable. Buttons are put in the right spots, and dont require much learning time. If people have said that they had to look down a lot or double check, their basically just novices to the whole gaming world in general. Those with even a little bit of gameplay experience will quickly see the craftmanship in this great product."
1,"Good System, Bad Controller",I love the Dreamcast as a system but let's face it thecontroller flat out ...! The buttons are WAY to far apart the triggers feel unatural to hold and are hard to hit and worst of all is the HORRIFIC placement of the cord! It also has various other problems including a hyper sensitive and very fragile analog stick and the utter lack of buttons.
2,What!,"This controller is the worst I have encountered on any system, ever. The wide design makes it close to impossible to reach the start button, and the cheap, fruity colored buttons get stuck ferquently. When I was playing Crazy Taxi, my fingers and wrists hurt so much I though I had carpal tunnel syndrome or something. I am giving this 2 stars because of the innovation of the VMU, but I hated this controller so much I went out and bought a dremstation, which converts the DC so that you can use PS controllers."
4,"Good, but small.","The controler layout is good overall, but the controler is a bit small for adult players. They do make larger off brand ones, if its a big concern."
5,"I love this controller, but","I love this controller, but where are the pictures of th ered controllers?"
2,Bad design,Dreamcast controller looks ugly. It's big and the the snappy thing at the bottom is kinda useless.
5,This is the best sized and most equipped controller yet.,"Playing with this controller gives you and unbelievable experience. Is not to bulky, and not to small."
4,Mackerelease this,this is some funny stuff and I have no idea how people ate anything back in the 70's if this is the food cook books were pushing on us
1,how could this ever get published?,"What the mother *F*! This book didn't have an introduction explaining its absurdity. I would have been completely lost if I hadn't read I'm Not the New Me. It is amazing that this could even get published...but I guess that's what happens when you're a children's book editor! I'm not for sarcasm...even Mark Twain writes that ""Sarcasm is the protest for those who are weak!"""
2,Warning: Book Contains Foul Language,"Since my mom did Weight Watchers in the '70s, I thought she might get a kick out of this book. I am SO GLAD that I didn't have it shipped directly to her! I do not use foul language, I make an effort to avoid buying merchandise that contains profanity, and I certainly don't give off-color gifts to people.I do appreciate the author's dry wit and sarcastic humor, but I don't think using four-letter words enhances the experience. As soon as I noticed the S-word at the 8th recipe, I knew I'd be seeking a refund for this item. In addition to the multiple occurrences of offensive words, the book contains quite a few references to drug use, being stoned, dropping acid, etc.All in all, thoroughly inappropriate for my purposes. What a shame, really, because the premise, the photos, and most of the commets are otherwise hilarious. But the profanity is a deal-breaker for me."
2,Mackerel Pudding and Frankfurter Crown Roast,Ms. McClure has discovered a teasure trove of revolting recipes all developed to help people lose weight. I thought the photographs were a hoot and her descriptions witty. I too could have done without the foul language in a few of the commentaries. Not necessary at all. I think my biggest disappointment is that there are NO recipes for any of this nasty looking food. Some of the best haha's in old recipes are found in ingredients and preparation. Just pictures of the WW cards and comments was ok but not very satisfying. Even one or two recipes would have assuaged me. Was there a copyright issue with Weight Watcher's? Who knows. There was no real introduction in the book... just back page notes.
3,"Naughty, Naughty, Naughty, Author!","This book was fun to look at for about 5 minutes. It soon gets tiring.If these recipe cards are real, which the author insists is true and which I doubt, I am amazed that her publisher did not make her give credit to the Weight Watchers corporation. This is a blatant example of copyright infringement if they are real. If the photos are faked then the joke is on us, the people who bought the book thinking they were real.Why don't we actually see one or two of the recipes themselves?"
2,So....basically this is a rip-off of The Gallery of Regrettable Foods by James Lileks,"I admit that I have never sat down with the book in front of me, but from the ""Look Inside"" feature, this book looks like a complete rip-off of James Lileks' The Gallery of Regrettable Foods (which is excellent I might add). I hope to find this book in a bookstore sometime to find out if it actually has more to offer.The Gallery of Regrettable Food"
4,Hilarious,This book was on the clearance table at the book store so I bought it for fun and I laughed out loud reading it. The one about the frozen cheese log was hilarious. Thanks for making me laugh Wendy.
4,Too funny to read quietly.,"This book is hilarious. It's also hilarious that anyone really ate the meals in this book. People had sterner stomachs in the old days, I guess! I snorted and laughed out loud over several of the entries. It's a fun book, and very funny."
4,VERY Fluffy!,"This is one of the funniest things I have ever read in my life. It is truly amazing that anyone, much less a large organization like Weight Watchers can actually think that these ""recipes"" looked even remotely edible.The commentary helps with the humor, but even on their own, this is some mighty hilarious stuff."
4,Good for beginners,"This book gives an excellent overview of what it takes to build a barn, from choosing the type, to preparing the gound, to hiring sub-contractors. Althought the plans can hardly be said to be ""complete,"" they do give a good idea of how different barn styles go together. You'll still need someone knowlegeable in buidling to help you in the actual construction. The plans include several innovative barn types and shapes. I particulary liked the circular barn with a jumping/training track on the perimeter, the stalls inside that and the ""aisle"" in the center."
1,Was very disappointed!,"I bought this cash register for my daughter for Christmas after reading the reviews, which for the most part rated this very well. My daughter was so excited and played with this for hours on Christmas Day, however it only worked for 2 days! :( She was very upset when it would not turn on even after replacing the batteries and pushing the reset button. I called Amazon and got a refund. Guess I will be shopping for a new one! I would not recommend purchasing this."
4,Great educational toy,"The toy itself is great. The kids love it! The top of the scale does not stay on properly. It snaps on, but if the kids even slightly bump it, it pops right off. Not that big of a deal in the grand scheme, but I imagine that piece will be lost in a matter of days.The other thing to note was the packaging. It was not put in an Amazon box and upon delivery the box was severely damaged. Thankfully my kids are too little to notice something like that, but had I been giving this as a present to my niece, I would have returned it."
1,"drawer not properly aligned and display constantly reads ""Drawer Open""","I started to wrap this a few days before Christmas & decided to check it first. The display read ""Drawer Open"" every time I pushed a button. The cash drawer is not aligned properly. If you hold the drawer shut, it works. My 2 year old twins will have to settle for another cash register for Christmas. I'm very disappointed and not happy about shopping with the crowds a few days before Christmas."
3,one day drawer broke,"I was disappointed that the drawer broke the first day as it was our boys favorite christmas present. Really cute and educational concept but when I tried to get a replacement they didn't have anymore from the same company but didn't offer me another for the same price either. This is sad as my boy really liked it and would have learned a lot I'm sure,so I can't give a very good review. Too bad!"
4,granddaughter enjoys it,Purchased for 4 yr. old granddaughter. She took right to it because there has been another similar type at her pre-school.
5,Excellent toy,"my grandgirls have fun playing ""restaurant"" taking ourorders/checking grandpapa and grandmaout.Amazon is the best....they have fast service I got this toy3 days after sending in. I have purchased many items fromthem and I have absolutely NO complaints"
1,Didn't work,"Ours worked briefly on Christmas morning but stopped soon after that. My husband got it working one more time, but again it stopped working."
1,Does not work properly,"Bought this product twice thinking that the first product must have been defective. When the second register arrived, we had the same experience. The buttons would not respond to anything. The reset button and new batteries did not resolve the problem. Very disappointed ... the register had alot of good features but they do not work ... twice!"
3,talks all night,"My daughter loves this toy. However, my husband and I do not. The thing turns on randomly. It wakes us up in the middle of the night saying ""welcome"" and no matter what we do, we can not get it to stay OFF! I believe it has something to do with the drawer not closing properly, which makes it think that someone is playing with it. If this cash register had an ON/OFF switch we would give it 5 stars."
1,Does not work,"We had the same experience as others, after 15 minutes none of the buttons worked. We pressed reset and changed batteries. We only received the Cash Box Open statement. Do not buy this toy."
4,Worth the $$ !,"I think this toy is well made, is worth the money and has lots of potential. My 4 year old boy is enjoying playing store and putting the coins in the slot. I believe he'll have a few years of fun with this investment!"
5,MONEY WELL SPENT,"I purchased this for my two-year old granddauughter for Christmas. Although she is still too young for some of the learning features of this toy, she is having a lot of fun scanning items, inserting coins in the coin slot an opening the cash drawer. She is already learning to identify the coins which are sized like the real things. This is definitely a toy that will offer new learning opportunities as she grows. I'm sure she will continue to have great fun playing with this toy over the next few years.The overall quality of this item is excellent. It is made of a durable, weighty plastic construction that keeps it stabilized. The only component I would improve on is the cash drawer, which opens too quickly and robustly causing coins to pop out.I would definitely recommend this product to my relatives and friends. It was money well spent."
5,It's a fun toy,Purchased for a Christmas gift for one of our 4 yr old boys. All of our kids think this is a fun toy and as a parent think it's a great educational toy. We can think up all sorts of activities to play with it as they play and begin to learn to count. It talks and beeps and makes noises. Fun!
5,Cash Register,"The price was excellent, the kids love it and they love to play grocery store with it. They love it and I love that they love it!!!"
1,Only lasted 6 months,"This toy was a lot of fun for my kids to play with, but the computer crashed after only 6 months of use for no apparent reason. No games, talking etc. now. Too bad."
3,Defective,"We bought this for our 4 year old granddaughter, she had asked for this on her Christmas Wish List. It arrived in good condition, however after putting in the batteries we discovered it did not work properly.Thankfully she was happy anyway opening and closing the draw and pretending to ring up our purchases."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Note: This item was not purchased through Amazon; it was a gift, but I feel it is important to let others know what a terrible product this is -- from reading the other reviews, I see I'm not alone! My son was so excited to receive this cash register for Christmas, but it didn't make past installation of the batteries. Display says Welcome, and speaker says ""let's play"" and that is that. THe drawer was hard to open, then got stuck upon closing. Nothing works, and you can't even shut it off (supposedly shuts off automatically -- but that didn't happen either). One serious piece of cr*p. Never been so disappointed. The price I see this listed for is insane. Don't buy it. I certainly plan to avoid any and all Learning Resources products."
1,I Would Pass On This Item,"I returned the first Teaching Cash Register because most of the working parts, the sounds, games, etc. did not work after the first 24 hours. I also returned the second Teaching Cash Register, again for the same exact reasons. For the short time that my grandson was able to play with his new toy, he loved it. Even though it's been said that ""third time is the charm,"" there was no way that I'd put in a third order for this toy."
4,"fun toy, but can be picky","My two young daughters really enjoy this register. It has some great features like the credit card and coupon discount card, which are lots of fun for the kids. The money looks like real money and it helps kids learn about making change and counting money. My only beef with it is that sometimes the register acts up and sticks and has to be completely reset. So it sort of has to be handled with care."
1,bad quality,Very disappointing... The drawer opens with such force that all the coins literally fly out at you and all over the floor. Toy also broke within one hour of opening. It wouldn't stop beeping and couldn't be reset with the button on the bottom.
5,very entertaining,"This is a great learning toy. My granddaughter just entered kindergarten and she can easily handle level 1 of some of the games. She is learning the difference between the various coins (penny, nickel, dime, quarter). The only ""flaw"" I see is that when you OPEN the cash drawer, the play money literally ""flies"" out. I am trying to teach her to hold one hand on the drawer without pushing in and that way she can buffer the impact.Overall, i would definitely recommend it as a toy for children 5 or over."
3,Not as great as reviews say,This looks to be sturdy and is educational. But buttons not as responsive as I expected. I do not want to push off 8 times before it goes off and certainly neither does my daughter.
5,Learning Resources Teaching Cash Register,"I purchased this toy cash register for my 8 year old granddaughter's birthday. I played with it before I wrapped it and was impressed by how realistic it is, not to mention educational. The sounds it makes are similar to a real cash register, and it seems pretty durable. My granddaughter loves it!"
4,Overall a good toy,"Good toy overall. Sometimes it just goes ""weird"" where it won't talk or say the numbers and will just beep when you push any button. But once you get it working right, it's a lot of fun for the kids. Also, when you open the drawer, it shoots out hard and the money goes everywhere which can be annoying. But we just showed our daughter how to open it with her hand putting a little force against it so it wouldn't do that and now she has that down."
5,Raising a Shopper,"I have a nearly 3 year old daughter who uses reciepts as comfort items and so, what better gift could her parents get her for CHRISTmas, than a cash register ;) She has actually been playing with one for a few months in the school lobby that no longer had ""play cash"" or batteries. She is absolutely thrilled to play with this everyday.My older children (ages 5 & 8) also love to play along with her and learn simple math money skills as well."
5,awesome. Fun games.,My 5 year old son and 3 year old daughter love this toy. Sturdy. Teaches fun money and math games. Worth the money.
1,Worked less than 2 minutes!,"We purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. It worked less than two minutes! We opened and set up the money. She closed the drawer and from there on out we received the error that the drawer was open, even though it wasn't. So disappointing on her gift."
5,Very nice,This is my daughter's christmas present and she love it. It's very funny and she love playing about supermarket! I love IT too
5,VERY EDUCATIONAL... HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR BOYS AND GIRLS,GREAT TOY... NICELY PUT TOGETHER... THIS IS THE SECOND CASH REGISTER WE ARE ON AS A FAMILY... AND IT IS PUT TOGETHER NICELY AND THERE ARE SOME NEW FEATURES..
1,Does Not Work,"Does not work properly right out of the box. Very disappointing. Keeps saying ""drawer open"" when the drawer is completely shut. Will not operate or allow play due to ""drawer open"""
1,"Never worked, kept saying drawer open.","Got this as a christmas gift for my son. Didn't work on arrival. WOuld only read out the coins, but kept saying drawer open so he was very frustrated. none of the keys worked. would not recommend because of this"
5,Great Learning Product,"I brought this for my eight year old son who is having problems with math/money. This is more than just a toy, it teaches the child how to identify money and count back money. I even play with it from time to time."
1,Arrived broken,The register is totally broken-it just says door open the entire time. :-(. Nothing else works because it's defaulting to door open the entire time.
5,Learning Resources Teaching Cash Register,"What a great toy for the kids to play with and learn! Great quality!! My kids love playing ""store and a clerk "" game with it and they get to learn numbers and simple math too. They price was excellent as well, as at the toys store this cash register costs much-much more. So everyone is happy !!!!"
4,Great toy - big hit with all the kids,"Santa got this for my 5 yr old son and he LOVES it. In fact all my kids (7,5,4) and all the kids that have come for a playdate love this toy. It teaches math skills and is loads of fun."
2,"nice idea, but drawer stuck the very first night","This toy is a great idea - although I'm not a huge fan of the ""credit"" card that comes with it sinec we are trying to teach our children to live a ""pay as you go"" rather than ""borrow as you go"" life. However, the register drawer got stuck the very first night and it sticks constantly with us having to pry it open each time. Therefore, I would not recommend this toy to other parents."
3,Daughter loved it but...,In the process of returning it to Amazon because the drawer kept sticking. Will probably order another one. 3 year old daughter anxiously awaiting her cash register.
1,Cash register not child-friendly,"You can't turn the register off, you just have to wait the 5 minutes of inactivity for it to automatically shut off. And there are different buttons to push to select different games, only one of them works, coin quiz. On level 2 of that game, it gives you an amount and you have to put various coins in to equal that amount. You'd think it would acknowledge when you got to that amount, but it does nothing. You press enter and it does nothing. If you put more in it tells you that you are wrong, but then it's too late. What a disappointment!"
1,worked for a few days,"Ours worked for a few days after Christmas. That was it. Followed the directions to reset, just keeps repeating the same thing and no buttons work. Our son is very disappointed."
2,Disappointed,We purchased and returned this twice. The buttons eventually don't work and it then becomes defective. I would advise against purchasing this product.
4,Learning Resources Teaching Cash Register,"The kids love it and all want to use it. Even the three year old loves putting the coins in and listening to the ""voice"" announce the coin value.The only negative is that when you release the cash drawer it comes out with so much force that the coins fly about throughout the area."
4,Great toy with a few glitches,"I got this for my grandson's fifth birthday, and he and his seven year old sister played store on it constantly for the first few days, scanning items around the house to ""buy."" It was good for both of their levels. He was learning the value of coins and dollars, and she was learning how to make change (for real not the way the clerks do in the stores looking at what the register tells them). It was a great toy with two exceptions. We had to keep resetting it from the bottom since it would lock up; and when you opened it unless you held onto the coin drawer it would jump out at you throwing the coins all over. If these two glitches could be remedied it would be a great toy. They also learned about credit cards and coupons, and there were games for practicing their math facts. Even their eleven year old brother would jump into their purchasing games sometimes. It says three and over, but I think this would be a little advanced for a three year old."
5,Perfect Toy,"Great toy. My 8 year old wanted a cash register to play store, so finally I bought this one. Lots of independent play and the machine really does all the things it purports it will do. Wished I had of bought it sooner. No complaints."
2,Missing Money,"I just gave this cash register to my 3 year old daughter for her birthday and the coins/cash were missing from the drawer. The User Guide specifically says that it comes with a drawer full of money, so I was very disappointed and so was my daughter when there was none. I will be sending it back."
1,Came defected.,"Unfortunately, the register came directed. It was a gift for my friend's son who loves numbers. He loves this toy so much that spends hours couting. I wish that all the features would work but the numbers on the screen don't add up the amount.The company handled it well and gave me a refund right away. However, I'm going to get a deferent type of register."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"i bought this for christmas for my daugther and she was so excited but when we put it together, the stupid thning didnt even work. it kept saying CB open and the coin bank was not open. it never worked and she cried and cried. thanks alot to whoever the seller of this product is for ruining my daugthers christmas!!!!!as an addition to my post...i returned the broken one in hopes of getting one that actually worked, but again they gave me another lemon!! thid time it kept saying the money drawer was open! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!now i have to pay to return the darn thing for a refund!! dont waste your time or money on this garbage!"
1,Product arrived not working,"I don't know what to do I ordered this a few months ago and my daughter just started playing with it. It doesn't work there is CB OPEN written on the screen and no button works!I have never returned anything to Amazon and I will be very disappointed if I have to pay anything to have this problem fixed.Anyway, could Amazon tell me what I have to do?"
4,Cash Drawer,"The overall product offers a lot of enjoyment for my 3 yr old grandson, but the force in which the drawer opens is a real problem as there is a 1 yr in the house too and if we don't find all the coins that have ""shot"" out when the drawer is opened, he finds them."
5,Kids love it!,"This is a great toy/learning tool. My daughters, ages 4 and 6, love the pretend play with this register. Quality appears to be there. Perfect way to continue building/reinforcing math skills."
2,would not buy again,"Product was given to granddaughter for Christmas and the first time she played with the cash register, the drawer door would close, but could not use cash register as it said door open, very poor design."
4,great toy but scanner doesn't talk now,I love this toy for my 2 boys and 1 daughter but the scanner doesn't talk anymore after only having it 7 months. I thought replacing the batteries might help or maybe there was a switch on it that turned it back on. No such luck. Great toy but wish the scanner still talked.
5,Great gift,it made my grandson very happy. It goes great with the cash register I bought him for x-mas. Thanks alot
3,Defective,The display was so dim that we couldn't read it and had to send back. From reading other reviews I would have to conclude the electronics on this item are pretty rickety. I generously gave it 3 stars because the physical construction is quite solid. Too bad about the electronics.
1,never arrived,I orered 2 of these cash registers a few days apart for two different kids for Christmas. Order was cancelled without telling me and meanwhile the kids were told to expect them but never arrived. I had to call on Jan 17 to find out for myself that orders had been cancelled. Disappointing. I'm not sure if I can trust to reorder. No explaination for the cancellation either.
1,Do not buy!,"The toy would be a good educational tool--if it worked. I purchased the product twice from 2 different companies on Amazon. One lasted a day, the other 2 months at the most. Both showed the warning ""Drawer Open."" Resetting the machine did not work."
4,Cool and fun................,"I bought it for my grand-dtr, she plays with it a lot, just have to watch out when the door opens, other than that, they learn about numbers & have fun. i"
5,Playing cash register and learning about money,Bought this for my son to use at home so he can practice his money skills. He really likes playing with it and I like that it also includes games in addition and subtraction. We play grocery sometimes and he likes to add up the money on the register after punching in the prices and he gives me change. Great for teaching your kids how to make change with money and how to add up money.
2,Another Broken toy,I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. She had it for less than a month before it broke. Needless to say I was very dissapointed.
5,fun cash register,I bought this cash register for my 2 year old daughter. She's a little young for the learning part (addition/subtraction) of it but loves opening and closing the drawer and putting the change in the coin slot.
2,Not a good experience,"This toy only comes w/coins and paper bills - nothing to scan w/the scanner, and nothing to weigh on the scale. I went to the company's website to see if a separate purchase was required, and nothing was listed. The directions were no help - they seem to imply that the items to scan come w/the unit. To top it off, the toy wouldn't respond to the buttons pressed. The instructions say to press the reset button when the unit acts up, which was strangely not installed anywhere on this toy. After fiddling w/it for awhile, we got the math games to work, but inconsistently, and the toy leaves no room for open ended, imaginative play if a child can't use the scanner or scale. The kids got bored really quickly w/just the number identification and math games. We were really looking for a toy w/more creative options."
2,Sadly disappointed,"My child loves to play with the toy at a friend's house. Unfortunately, the cash drawer stuck on the first one we received. Amazon exchanged it - no problem. The second one arrived and I played with the coin recognition feature before giving it to my child. I noticed it was not 100% accurate in naming the coin I inserted. I went very slowly to give it time to answer before putting in the next coin. So I returned the 2nd one. I'm not sure if we just had bad luck and got 2 bad ones; I was unwilling to try a 3rd. This product has great features and my child loves it, but I wasn't willing to risk confusing her. Amazon however has won my loyalty with their quick exchange and acceptance of my final return."
4,Great product...no issues,"We haven't had any issues with it so far. Works great. Seems very sturdy and well made. If you keep getting an error saying ""CB Open"" that means the little yellow bar for the coin slot needs to be pushed down completely. It's not refering to the cash drawer. I've read a lot of reviews that mention this...not sure why it's so confusing because the owner's manual clearly states what that error means.The cash drawer does open forcefully, but I taught my daughter to hold it while opening it which solved that problem. Most of the games are too advanced for a 3 yr. old, but the most basic functions are still fun for her and then she will be able to play with the games when she's older."
5,Fun for Everyone...,My daughter received this as a gift and still plays with it a few years later. To the lady who says there is no reset button - yes there is - it is on the bottom. When we first got it I was a bit confused because the coin slot needs to be pushed all the way down for it to work properly. Over all this is a great toy - and will last them years - ours has been through it all and still works fine. Very neat toy.
3,One big problem...,"My little guy really enjoys this toy so far. I love all of its features and he'll definitely be able to use it for years to come. HOWEVER, I have one BIG problem with it. Whenever he hits the button to make the money drawer open up, it opens with such force that it flings all of the coins all over the place. It does it EVERY time and it gets very frustrating. This is my only major criticism of this item, but it's a big one. I rated it a 3 based off of educational value."
1,does not work properly,"first of all this toy came to my door in no packaging, the original box with a shipping label right on it. who sends toys out in november with no covering.? poor poor choice for a toy company. so i gave it to my daughter to play with and after 2 sets of new batteries it still does not work. will not buy from this company again. i hope santa does better than i did with the cash register request!!!!! totally bummed in minnesota...."
1,Did not work,"Same experience as others have mentioned. Put batteries in and only got CB Open message. None of the buttons worked and resetting didn't help. I'd actually saw one out in a local toy store and played with it a bit and also noticed what others are saying about the coin counter counting the coins incorrectly, like saying that a penny was a dime. Not sure why I even bought it after that. If it worked, it would be great. Very disappointed that my 2 year old didn't even get to play with it."
5,great educational toy,This cash register has many features that will allow it to be used by children of many ages and abilities. One added feature that I like is that real coins can also be used so if the provided coins are lost the cash register is still usable.
2,Disappointed with the Quality,"Got this toy for my 5-year-old son for Christmas. We had a lot of fun playing with it and learning our money. However, we were really disappointed when, in under a month, the buttons stopped working. And since it's the Open button, the cash register is now pretty much useless."
1,I would pass on this toy register....,"Okay, so I saw the overall good ratings this toy register has received and decided to get one for me 3 and 2 year old sons. Well, the first one arrived and it was missing parts so I sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement. The replacement was shipped to me with a UPS sticker on the actual toy register's box, rather than being enclosed in another shipping box as the first one was. I understand this with some 'tough' items, but this was just sloppy and lazy on some Amazon worker's part. The box was decently beat up when I received it and this item should not have been shipped this way. So, then after opening it up, all the parts are there and it looks okay! Yea! Well, after putting in batteries, the thing thinks the drawer is always open even when it is closed. So... back it goes. Getting a refund this time and going for another brand of toy register."
1,"Broken upon receipt, woudnt refund money","I got this thing for my son after a major surgery,, he was not fit for playing with it for a while so when we finally opened it it was a few days after you are allowed an exchange/refund.. Anyway it was broken. It did not work at all. Neither Amazon nor the company would help me.. So basically I threw $40 out the window.."
2,Fun but NOT durable,"We have bought three of these for my 4/5 year old preschool class. Each one broke after only a short time. The dollars go behind the drawer and get stuck, or the drawer will not close or the calculator feature breaks. This last one lasted TWO DAYS and we made sure our kids played gently. If it worked it would be great to learn simple math and coin identification. But, we will not waste the money ever again."
4,Daughter loves this toy!,I bought this item for my daughter's third birthday. She loves it!! The best part is the coin counter. She could sit there forever just inserting the coins.The only drawback is the drawer opens a little too quickly so the coins come flying out. I taught her how to put her hand out to modulate the speed of it opening. Other than that she is very happy with the toy and so am I.
1,Not good quality,"This was a gift from Santa, and from the moment we got it out of the box, it was not working well. The power were go on and off which I found was b/c the batteries did not get in snug enough to power it up all the way. Also, the ""screen"" is very confusing for younger children and the balance to weigh stuff is a joke. Do not buy this product. It is made very poorly."
5,I re-read this one at least once a year- it's a keeper!,"I wish Ms. Klimo would write more like this, and tell us what becomes of everyone in this teriffic book. I've had it for years and re-read it often. The characters are fun, the situations are very real, and the whole book has a solidness to it. You know how everyone feels, and it's poignant. I reccommend this book to anyone with children, or pregnant- or trying to concieve."
3,A nice enough set,"I bought this as a gift for Christmas and thought it came in a larger and nicer case. I was a bit disappointed when I received it. However, the person I bought it for liked and said that the pieces were very nice."
2,For absolute beginner's,"For someone who just wants to know the basic's of win2k professional...this is the book.If you are trying to work towards your win2k certification,look somewhere else."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Do not even think you can study this book and even come close to passing the MCSE test for W2K professional. The book is great about telling you all the definitions for W2K and telling you vague parameters of how the system is set up. However, Microsoft does not care squat about all of that. The test is all about real world implementation. The book covered about 40% of what was on the test. Hmmm...maybe that is why I scored a 420 on the test."
3,Not enough detail!,"I read this book and felt that I had a pretty good grasp on Win2k Pro. A few days later, a friend let me borrow his Windows 2000 Professional Exam Cram. I read the book and I was amazed at how much more detailed it was. Sybex left out a lot of crucial information, stuff you have to know to pass the test. After reading the Exam Cram, I felt much more confident and passed the 70-210 exam. This book is good as a reference guide for basic Win2k functions, but if you want to pass, read the Exam Cram."
3,"It was okay, but it could have been better","I'm an NT MCSE who has just started taking the 2000 exams. I studied this book and passed the test, but there were a few things on the test that the book didn't cover very well, mainly familiarity with hardware configuration/troubleshooting. Also, the test hammered away on practical situations, whereas the book hammered away on rote regurgitation.Example book question: What dialog box tab is the feature to adjust X on? Example test question: Jim wants to configure his laptop to do X. He has done Y and Z, what does he need to do next? (You didn't expect *real* questions from the test, did you? :-)But I won't complain too much, I think it's the best book out there so far, and after all, I *did* pass with a pretty good score. Just be sure that you actually study ON A COMPUTER and not just from the book. (That's obvious, though, isn't it?!?)"
5,Sybex Still My Favorite,"Since I've had my MSCE since 1997, I really can't comment on this book's value to beginners in the IT world. But I found this book perfect for me to pass the Professional exam the first time around with minimal study. The practice tests were great to identify my weak points, and the text had more than adequate information to improve my knowledge of those weakpoints.I've taken over 15 certification tests - Microsoft, Cisco and Compaq - over the last few years and have developed a standard self-study procedure. I buy the ""official"" study guide from the vendor (Cisco's are excellent)AND a copy of my favorite 3rd-party study guide. For Microsoft certifications, my favorite has been Sybex for years. Based on my experience with this book, Sybex is still the way to go."
3,A great book for basic understanding but no good for exam,"Hi,I successfully passed out 70-210 yesterday.Wouldn't have passed if I had relied only on Sybex book.As my title reveals,this book is good no doubt but only for beginners who just want to know how to use Windows 2000 Professional operating system.But to pass the exam you need to know much more.The questions given at the end of each chapter are very easy and straight forward,none of the questions which i faced yesterday (in the exam) were so easy and direct.All The Best!!-Meghana."
2,Sometimes great,"I'm so disappointed! My daughter received this toy for her 3rd birthday, 6 months ago. She loved it. We got the special edition Cinderella one. The Dora book pack worked just fine. For Christmas/Hanukkah, we bought her several more books from [...] Half of the books worked, and the other half do not. There's no explanation!"
2,Ceased to function,"The story it came with was Nemo and read in a very wooden matter. The Sesame Street pack was nice.Just as my son became very attached to the reader, it just stopped. It didn't get wet or get dropped...complete mystery.When I contacted Publications International to troubleshoot, they said that since I've had the product for more than 3 months, there's nothing they can do. It's been in use for a little over 3 months.Buyer beware."
5,Great Toy,"My 3 year old daughter loves this toy because she can ""read"" by herself. Once I showed her how to change the books and cartridges, she could do it alone with ease. As a mother, I love this toy because it keeps her engaged for quite awhile, which is especially great on long car trips! I bought lots of the other books, all of which she loves. The narrator speaks clearly, and the sound effects are good too. We've had this toy for six months and it gets used alot, but the batteries haven't needed to be replaced yet. Overall, this is a great toy, well worth the price!"
1,Ripoff! Scam! Misleading Advertisements!,"This toy requires an A/C Adapter, which is not included. My daughter opened her gift at Christmas, anxious to try her, but she only cried. None of the advertisements tell you that the accessory pack is required. Why not include it in the toy, and charge the extra $10 so buyers understand the real value proposition. Publications International marketing group should be sued for misleading advertising. What a bunch of low life scam artists. A toy should be functional out of the box. At a minumum, batteries should be capable of operating the toy. Requiring a proprietary accessory kit stinks. Don't buy this toy. Don't reinforce misleading marketing tactics like this. [...]"
5,Crystal clear sound and easy to use...even for a toddler,"When my two-year old daughter received this toy as a Christmas gift, I was sure it would be too complicated for her. To my pleasant surprise, she learned to use it (by herself) the first day! To say that she loves it is an understatement. But the really wonderful thing about this toy is that (unlike SO MANY of her other ""talking"" toys) the voice is extremely clear and unmuffled--by far the best I've ever heard. I can hear and understand what the narrator is saying from the next room. To keep the pieces together, we keep the books and cards in one of those slide-zip plastic bags--we haven't lost a piece yet. My only problem with this toy is that my two-year old and my older daughter (4 1/2) are always fighting over it. An excellent toy!"
5,Taylors love this reader!!!!!!!!!!!,"My daughter loves to be read to. If I am cleaning, she can sit in her chair and listen to stories herself. She loves the music and the ""noise"" that tells a child when to turn the page. This unit is battery operated and portable."
3,I Want More,A very brief chronological history of the Dallas Cowboys. Despite its brevity it did filled many gaps in my knowledge of this great team. The DVD focussed a lot on Tom Landry and Roger Staubach. It would have been good to spend more time on some of the other Cowboy greats. Perhaps span the history over several DVDs.
4,America's Team,"It's interesting how this video covers the history of the Cowboys. I like the stuff on the 60's teams, especially with Lilly, Meredith and Garrison. What is problematic is in disc 2 where it has the game where Dallas came back to win at Atlanta, that they omit the fact that the Cowboys lost to the Rams the year before (1979) and to the Eagles in the 1980 NFC title game. If White was a great quarterback, he would have found a way to win the Eagles game."
3,"Good Stories, but Overpriced","This book provides a good mixture of fantasy and science fiction short stories, but for a paperback in ""fair"" condition is far overpriced."
3,Why to read this book,"Told from a young boys perspective, this book describes what it was like for the Chinese in the US at the turn of the century.Although I did not enjoy Lawrence Yep's writing style for the most parts, there were times, such as the San Francisco earthquake, and whent the boy and his father must deal with their collaege's Opium addiction, where I was quite captivated. I also felt that Lawence Yep really brought the charectors to life, and I enjoyed the ending which does not tell what hapened to the charectors, or even leave with a sence that you know what will happen, but instead, with a bit of hope and wonder.Although I would not recommend this book for the writing, I did learn a lot about what the Chinese did to get to the US and then what they delt with once they arrived.I think this book is terrific for anyone who is studying, or is interested in Chinese immigration to the USA."
5,An excellent resource,"Perhaps the best feature of this book is the fact that it is structured as one large outline. This makes the material extremely easy to follow. It also allows for the individual subjects to be accessed easily. For example, if one is looking for information on ""The Trinity and the Deity of Jesus Christ"" (an important topic when dealing with the JW's), they will have little trouble finding the information because the book has a format that is user-friendly.If you enjoy ""doing"" counter-cult apologetics, I cannot think of any resource I would give a higher recommendation to than this one. It has the three key features everyone should look for...1) an easy to follow format; 2) an objective presentation of the particular false teaching being discussed; and 3) a solid, Biblically-based refutation that can be appreciated by the Pastor, as well as the layman."
4,Good Introduction to the Jehovah's Witnesses,"In my humble opinion, Bowman has written an excellent introduction to the Jehovah's Witnesses and how their teachings contradict the Holy Bible.The booklet's contents are as follows:1. Introduction to the Witnesses (history, membership, publishing empire).2. Theology - what the Witnesses believe about the Trinity, Jesus Christ, God, Death and Hell, Resurrection, Salvation, and Christ's Return and how these beliefs contradict true Christianity.3. How to witness to the Witnesses.4. Bibliography for studying more on the group.5. Comparison of the Witnesses' statements on various topics and what the Bible says about the topic.All in all, an excellent guide for understanding more about a fast-growing group and how to address them in spiritual matters.Recommended!"
1,dModre baloney!,Biased and lies. No one has ever seen the Holy Spirit. It or he does not have a name. Pagan doctrine. Quote scriptures out of context or scriptures that have no bearing on the subject matter. Very poorly researched and even poor application. do not buy this crap. Not worth it. gil
1,"Nonsense!...really no stars, but there's no selection for it","This book won't help you any. It's biased, therefore not reliable. And Jehovah's Witnesses are over 6.4 million around the world. Talk to them yourself instead of trying to read lies about them like in this book and other books that are suggested here about them."
1,More lies than you could imagine!,"This guy is just a vindictive parasite, cashing in on people's curiosity and filling their heads with outright fallacies.If people want to know the truth about ANYTHING, the only way to learn about it is by going to the source. This guy has evidently not spoken to real life Witnesses. Ever. What he says is based upon hearsay, apostate testimony, mass media lies and his own inventions.You could walk down the street and convince people that Hitler was a hero and a philanthropist more successfully than you would trying to tell them this book had any relevance to the subject of its title.This heretic tome is to be avoided by anyone looking for true information. If you are after sensationalist lies and clap-trap, feel free to fill your own head with crap like this."
2,Buy the INTERACT TREMOR PAK is BETTER,"I have played with the Two of them, the INTERCT TREMOR PAK is much better that SEGA's Name brand... with this one you don't feel the hits in NFL Y2K... but with the other brand INTERACT.. wow!.. you can even feel it when the player is running..so don't buy SEGA.. but INTERACT.. for $9.99, here in this place.."
2,Weak,"It's hard for me to understand how a first-party peripheral can be this weak. The official Dreamcast Jump Pack works properly, don't get me wrong, but the feedback is considerably weak when compared to the Interact TremorPak and the Mad Catz Force Pack. Both of the latter can be purchased for half the price of Sega's, and both offer more intense vibration. Save your money and go for the third-party packs this time around."
3,A Fun Accessory,"I bought the Sega Jump Pack shortly after I received the console for Christmas. It works great, but can be annoying with games like Rayman 2, when the helicopter buzzes constantly. But for explosions and hits on the other Dreamcast games, it adds more effect."
3,Fun but NOT for Long Hours of Playing,"This accessory if very fun to have. Some games let you control the ""rumbles"", like Hydro Thunder. The Jump Pack add to the horror theme of Code Veronica. It can even fit into the Dreamcast guns. However, I can't recommend using this thing for long hours of playing. My hands would ache. My fingers would go numb. Plus, this accessory add signifigant weight to the controller pad. Use with caution."
5,Cool!,"Hey!This is the best ""thing"" you can get for your Dreamcast, it's totally awesome! You should feel thoose explosions when for an example a man hit you in a game... BANG... it's like being in the game...it's almost hurts, so real is it! This is something else than ""the rumble pack"" and ""the dual shock""...If you have a Dreamcast, my advice is, BUY THIS SHOCK NOW! ......"
1,DON'T BUY A DREAMCAST JUMP PACK..Buy a PREFORMACE JUMP PACK!,"It looks like people are complaining about how you don't feel anything with this product. Well, i own two ""'preformace' jump packs"" (not made by dreamcast) and they work great. And PLUS not only are they a jump/rumble pack, but it also holds 200 blocks of memory. So folks i strongly suggest buying these from this after market company.Oh yeah...You feel the RuMbLE....TRUST ME."
3,Okay guide when used with other materials,"The guide has much useful information for newbies, but Mr. Chiu should leave the humor to someone else. He constantly tries to make jokes (perhaps the editor said ""Keep it light"") and he is not funny. This book is okay, especially if it's just one book in your aviation library, but there are other, better guides out there."
2,"Very basic, and written in a rather patronizing format.","I cannot say this is the best investment I have made; I bought this book on the assumption that, since it was a product of Microsoft Press, it would have a high-quality writer. I have not found this to be true. Ben Chiu's style is repetitive and some of the language is not very ideal for a book like this. Ben tries to add some humor to his work, but unsucessfully. Maybe if Alan Bramson had been the author it would have been better- he has a fresh wit, and provides entertainment. Think of another book, or put the money towards a flying lesson in a Cessna."
5,Superior sound oldies.,"Eric Records continue their release of remastered from the 'first generation mastertapes' series under the ""Dick Bartley Presents...."" logo.This disc contains - among its 18 tracks - the original long version of (You're My) Soul and Inspiration/Righteous Brothers; and true stereo versions of Love Is All Around/Troggs, and A Whiter Shade of Pale/Procol Harum.The biggest reason to get this set is the superior sound quality and the original mixes."
4,I hope to read more from Ms. Fobes soon!,"What a wonderful story! With a long legacy to overcome, the hero and heroine of this book work together to surmount the odds. The book has it all: love, intrigue, murder, lies, and redemption. I found it very difficult to put this book down, and it was only after my husband threatened to turn the light off himself, that I actually had to stop (though I finished it the next day). Nicolas and Catherine drew me into their story and kept me there. If you have the chance, definitely read this book!"
3,Wait for the next batch of MSSQL 2000 books,"This book suffers from the same shortcomings of most first-wave books on a new product. There are references to features and limitations of the previous version of the product and editing oversights that would mislead a reader unfamiliar with the product. I have used MSSQL 7.0 for some time and there were points in the book that were in conflict with what I knew to be true that caused me to re-read a statement a few times before I realized what the author meant to say. Unless you absolutely have to have a MSSQL 2000 book now I would wait for the next batch of books. Only with better editing could I recommend this book. In the meantime if you don't need a tutorial on SQL the Books Online that come with MSSQL 2000 will serve as a more reliable reference.I was hoping for ""Inside SQL Server 2000"" and should have waited the extra month. If it proves to be as good as the 7.0 version it will be well worth the wait."
2,"Should be called ""swing patterns on windows""","Virtually all 23 examples are based on swing and awt. The discussions are mostly a swing lovefest. This for me is a huge distraction. Patterns are a big enough challenge in addition to learning java client programming, which I have no interest in. Events and listeners, in my view, are very specialized and leave me wondering where these patterns may fit into the type of programming I do (xml/xsl, ejb, servlets).The Windows format, glaring for the rmi example(fortunately already did it on unix), was only a minor short comming in comparison.However, I found ""design patterns explained"" to be one of the best programming books I have ever read."
2,One of the Worst Books,"I needed this book for a class. It was one of the worst books I have read. The first big problem is that every example is about fireworks. I found myself often struggling with firework concepts to understand the book. The second problem is that the book continually has questions/problems with the answer in the book. Before the concept seems to be fully explained, it is asking you to complete a diagram. I want the book to show me example, explain it and then test me, not test me beforehand."
1,Not worth the time and money,"There is no point to buy this book if you already have the book of Gang of Four. Good help to understand all the patterns is using simpler examples than what Gang of Four used. Unfortunately, this book was unable to take the advantage of Java language to use simple examples to illustrate the point and concept of each design patten.One star might be too mean. However, if we are saying what someone already did, it would be better to use simple examples and make it easy to understand. Otherwise, what's the point?"
2,I don't like the approach...,"This book is well written but it asks too many questions. I was hoping for a book that gave examples of the patterns and discussed how to use them. It does a nice job of describing the concepts, but it always stops short of giving a good example of the pattern currently under discussion.It also does something that drives me nuts...it makes me work really hard to understand a concept and then explains that is the wrong way to handle the problem and that you should do it another way. I understand why authors do this, but I don't like technique because I think it creates confusion.All in all I am disappointed with the book."
2,Looks like a homework of a university student.,It is basically to understand Java Swing framework.Does not add anything to an avarage experienced programmer.Looks like a double spaced University homework.
2,content is very loose,Content is too short. Examples and questions are too simple. Does not add anything to an avarage experienced programmer.
4,Book that has java code for design patterns...,"I wanted to get a book which would give me some examples in Java for learning design patterns , I tried to read the Gof book but found it difficult to unserstand the examples in C++ as I mainly have done programming in Java, and I found that this book promises to provide just that. So I guess it should be worth the price and looks good when I read the first chapter on Interfaces, learnt quite new things about that!!4stars becoz haven't read all of it so far-:)"
3,Slow!,"I found the many narratives with no commentary very slow reading. It didn't pull together until the last chapter.Some of the problem was the format. It was very difficult to check the endnotes, etc. I wish I had purchased the hard copy."
1,The book has magical powers,"Every time I start reading it I fall asleep. I am open to mystical occurrences but we are talking some wild stories here. The author criticizes society for commercializing Native American religion and in a sense making it a joke. Yet, the very action of writing this book encouraging people to take an interest in the Native American ways by tempting them with the powers they could attain is commercializing it."
2,Disappointing.,"I didn't got into this movie expecting much and that's pretty much what I got. Some of the acting is abysmal and the fight scenes are mediocre. The story feels forced. I found myself fast-forwarding through the movie just to see the fight scenes, but each was more of the same. You get the feeling of been there done that from other films. The lead may be good at martial arts, but the choreography was more like street fighting. I like a good fight scene, but none of theme were memorable. I was surprised to see a few actors in this film that recently had decent roles in major films. Marina Sirtis was unexpected. Brian Thompson is a much better actor than this. I wasted about a half hour of my life on this film. I'm glad I didn't waste any more."
1,awful,"I can usually sit through the dumbest martial arts movies, just to get to the martial arts, but this one has some of the worst acting in the world so I fast forwarded to the action scenes and they were terrible too. A waste of my time."
1,TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY,"If your a serious prankster then DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. The majority of the stuff in here are things that were probably funny back in the 1800's. I bought this book thinking id have a arsenal of new pranks but was severely dissapointed. Whoever reviewed this and gave it 5 stars was way off. Trust me, find something more updated because this book is not. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!! If anyone has any idea were i can get a decent prank book, by all means let me know."
3,Jumpstart Guide to the Canon EOS 5D,"This guide does serve as an introduction to the camera, but the presentation is rushed and the sections on lens and accessory choice suffer from being primarily ads for lenses from one manufacturer (Sigma) and tripods and cases from other manufacturers. A slower pace guiding the user through the controls while the camera is assumed to be in hand--so the actions can be concurrently carried out on the camera--would be much better."
2,Very light on detail... The test is much more in depth.,I read this book from cover to cover and found myself wondering if that was all there was to this test. The book is very light on the details of tracking down errors with AD. It is also very light on the tools that you would use to solve these problems.The real problem is that the test is very heavy on real world situations and without significant real world experience you will be unable to pass this test by reading this book.
5,The white master,"Dreamcast is the best console in this moment,and have the most original and exelent games in market.Dreamcast its something...i dont have words to describe this white console,let me see...oh yes i got it is woderful,alucinant etc.i need more stars to rate dreamcast.posd:what are doing ps2,gc and xbox in the market?"
5,The best I've seen,"Dreamcast is in my opinion the best console out to date. Although no longer in production it is in the same league as Xbox, GCube and PS2, and it came on the market about 3 years before either of these. I have and Xbox and they are very close in graphics and gameplay(dreamcast may be faster). I actually prefer my dreamcast over my Xbox when it come to any games other than sports games where you may want the updated rosters for the game. But this roster differnce are pretty much the only difference I've observed. Also, this system is not as restricted with all those one player games like Xbox and PS2, it has more games you can play with your friends. So if you don't mind the fact that games are no longer in production for this system then it is one of the best, and it still has more games to offer than the Xbox does(more multiplayer games as well)."
5,this is the best system your'll see in a while,this system it great it has super grafic great prossesser everthin
5,The system is a must have for any Sega or Sonic lovers!,The first game I reviewed was Rumble Boxing. The games amazing quick reaction and smooth gameplay shocked me. The sharpness of the game was unimaginable. THIS IS A MUST HAVE! NOW THAT YOU READ THIS BUY IT FROM AMAZON.COM!
5,Dreamcast=Great,"Sega has definitly out done themsevles again! The graphic engine is superb, sonic adventages looks stunning on this babie, the details are vert realistic and just for your imformation, it loading time is much shorter than that of playstation.If you have a huge Monitor, try to use it with a monitor, then you would really want even more of dreamcast.Be sure to get the visiual menory system if it does not come with the set, then when you are playing a game, a mini game would be downloaded to the VMS. The best part is that with this you can built up your character when you are not playing your main game on Dreamcast. It is a great idea from Sega.Well, the internet feature is awesome, too bad it isn't avalible in Singapore yet."
1,horrible,"i thought this would be a good console, i was very very dissapointed! it has very few good games, and the graphics arent all that i expected from it,i sold my DC and now i am waiting for the x box."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have both a dreamcast and a PS2. Let me say that the PS2 blows the dreamcast away. The PS2 has seamless graphics, the dreamcast is choppy and slow. Don't be fooled, you get what you pay for. Bottom line, spend the extra dough and be content with your purchase,if you get this you wil be disappointed, and left with a mediocre system."
3,Where are the EA Sports Games?,"I bought the dreamcast because of its lower cost than PS2 and because I could get one for Christmas, but I am starting to regret this decision. NFL2k is not that great of a game although the graphics are nice. I have used playstation for the last few years and I have come to expect more from sports games. Does Sega not have a liscense agreement with EA sports? If not the DreamCast may be obsolete in a few months because its games do not have the depth and game play that are customary in EA games. Does anyone out there know if Sega will ever get a deal with EA? If not I may have to put the DreamCast up for sale even though I have only owned it for two weeks."
1,Dreamcast is DEAD!!!!,"Come on, man. I agree with you that dreamcast's games are a lot of fun BUT it is hard to find the games to play. Last 6 months, I still can buy the dreamcast game (NBA2K2) but now you CANNOT get any dreamcast games or systems.Sega no longer make any games for dreamcast.No new games in DC and it is dead! Don't waste your money with it."
2,Game system broke,"I bought this game system for my boyfriend's birthday. He wanted a brand new one so I bought the over priced brand new out of the box dream cast. It worked great for about a week and a half. Then it just stopped working. My boyfriend contacted the company and they said to send it back in for either a replacement or a refund. He sent it back in for a replacement at his own expense. He has not heard from the company again. They will not return his e-mails, nor have they sent him his new dream cast. I am very disappointed with the way this situation turned out."
3,Sega have no idea when to realease their systems,"This system has good graphics, but it was released between the time of ps and ps2. Sega whould have waiting a year. While they do that, they should have upgraded the system. Therefore, this system was not in the competition of gcn, xbox, and ps2. nothing more to say... its a disapointment that i bought this piece of junk for the price of 3 ps1 which is way better. there are only 20 games for this thing. im sure NEVER gonna buy any sega consoles ever."
2,DOA,"I've seen this before...Sega puts out systems on the market, hoping to get the jump on anything else out there, but seriously screwing themselves up in the process. They take advantage of the weak moments from the other video game companies (Nintendo and Sony), and then they put out a piece of equipment they claim to be ""advanced."" Sure, Dreamcast will be the best show in town for a while, but what happens when PSX2 and Dolphin come out, utilizing the DVD technology? What's going to happen to this ""CD-Rom"" stuff? Take it from me, this system is one you can easily pass over. Cling to your N64 and Playstations, and just wait for TRUE next generation in video game consoles..."
5,Sega has a new system............................DREAMCAST!,"Sega has a new system............. DREAMCAST! The ultimate in consoles. When I first got dream cast, a few weeks ago, I easily plugged it in, and turned it on. I was so excited. I had to put the time, date, and year on it and let it rest for two hours. When I turned it on after the two hours I was amazed! Not only was it better than any other system that I had bought, but the games were so realistic and fun!!!!!!! I recommend Dreamcast if you have N64 or Playstation. I also recommend Sonic Adventure!!!"
1,playstation2 is far!!!far!!!far!!! better than dreamcast,"you know it,I know it, ps2 is way better than dreamcast. and it's just the truth,and i'm so so sorry if you can't take the truth.AND what makes it so bad is that I have a dc. THIS MESSAGE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO COULD HANDLE THE TRUTH!!! SORRY IF I MADE YOU MAD,BY TELLING THE TRUTH."
1,Dreamcast Sucks,"I sold the most chocalate for a school fundraiser and here was my reward,A cheap video game system with graphics worser then a Gamecube. I have a Wii and I'm satisfied with it,so don't waste your cash and buy a Wii!"
2,Good but not good enough,"The Sega Dreamcast is good, but by the history of the sega and the psx2 out I think u should save ur Money for the psx2. The only thing that Sega has over the psx2 right now is internet, but the psx2 is getting that soon anyways. I have bought all the sega products except the 32x for the genesis and is always deserted by Sega. The graphics are awesome for the Dreamcast but if it had extra disk capacity it would make it tough competition for psx2. In all if u really are a tru gamer and must have all systems, get this system, right after psx2."
1,Question,"I have a question here. A lot of people say that Dreamcast is such a good system. How come it wasn't popular? Was everyone thinking more about PS2, Gamecube, and Xbox? I have never played a Dreamcast before (though I did hold the controller and found it quite large), so I am not saying whether it is good or bad. Thanks"
1,the internet is stupid on sega dreamcast,"56K moddem adapter,the internet on Sega dreamcast will tie up the phones while you surf the web. If you have a phone call your parents will tell you to get off the internet. The kidswill not be happy when your parents tell you to get off theinternet. The Internet on sega is dialup and it takes about3 minutes to get on the web. Some times on dreamcast it knocksyou out on the web."
1,Suit yourself,"Right now, I do think the Dreamcast is better than PS2. It's a pretty good. But I don't care to waste about ... in total on the system, controllers, games, vmus, keyboard, etc. Why spend all that money so when in fall this year i've spent all this money on.............nothing. Same for the PS2. The reason I'm sayig this is because in the fall, Xbox is coming out. When it does, I will buy it(cause im on the pre-order list)and then spend ... on stuff for the Xbox because it WILL BE the greatest console ever created(if you don't beleve me, just take a look at it's stats compared to the Gamecube and PS2. blows the competition righ out of the water and into the sky about 50 miles.) But if you want your Dreamcast go ahead and buy it. Just be careful..."
5,"Great System, Even Better Price",This is a great game system!!!! Its looks good on screen & plays great. Tons of fun games for it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new system! :o)
5,dreamcast rocks,"The dreamcast is a great buy. Unforutnately i bought it before the 50 $ price drop. it has awesome graphics my highest rcommended games our soul calibur (#1 recomende),nfl 2k1 dave mirra, crazy taxi and nba showtime.the ps2 is all hype dont fall for it when u can get the same deal for 1/4 of ps2 price the vmu screen is awesome and the controllers phat. there is virtually no load time on games . BUY DC U WONT B DISAPOINTED"
5,SONIC FOREVER!!,"Ten Years already? Bah, I won't go on about how glad I am that SOnic's still gonna be around even when Sega is going 3rd party. Anyway, I luuuuuuv DreamCast, and I've played it because my friend has it. However, I can't belive the targeted audince is 15 year old _males_. First off, I'm an 11 year old GIRL. Ahem. And, most of the Sonic fans I've encountered are GIRLs. And what about vilonce or sports stimilations means that the games are for boys, not girls?"
2,Big bang then it fizzles,"Take it from a life-long gamer who owns every system and reviews many games. The dreamcast will at first dazzle you then let you down. With only three truly unique and superior titles and little more on the way, you might want to hold on to your money till 2000 and the PS2. Whlie the graphics are empressive the gameplay is very sub-par(even compared to the current Playstation). The modem and dreamcast networking has a terrible browser and too many bugs to mention. The jump pack technology is terrible, the vmu erases itself, and the controler will not stand up to hardcore gamers. Wait till PS2 to arrive in late summer or early fall 2000. It will be a better system."
5,"The funnest toy of the fall , a must have for all","If you like Video games , wait till you see this . 128 bit graphics , 56 k modem , 19 games to chose from at launch . What more could you ask for for a video game system?"
5,Dreamcast will bring out your wildest dreams,"I know what every video game fan out there is thinking: Is Sega really back and am I going to get burned getting this system? Having attended E3 earlier in the year and the buzz it generated, I can say quite confidently that Sega has a hit on its hands. Anybody who has seen the collection of games in the lineup will know what I mean. The DC absolutely blows away the PS and N64, and they have a solid lineup of games right from the start that will appeal to a wide variety of players. Sony and Nintendo are trying to steal Sega's thunder with their upcoming systems, but I don't see how anyone can go wrong purchasing Dreamcast. It is simply state-of-the-art. Sega is definitely back, and this system is proof of that."
3,Buy a Dreamcast and you will regret it when PS2 comes out!!!,"Yes, I have to say that the Dreamcast does pack a pretty good punch.....for now. Sure it has excellent graphics and a few good games that would keep a person happy just for a couple days, but that's it. The problem that saturn had and looks like DC is having is that they only come out with a couple games a month. The DC is just a tiny taste of what the PS2 will be. PS2 already has around 90 titles in the making. I just don't see how any one could shell out the dough just for another breeze in the gaming industy. STAY AWAY FROM SEGA!!!!!!!"
4,Great system with a few pitfalls.,"Good points? Amazing processor, Great graphics, Awesome sound, and SOUL CALIBER. Bad? Controllers can be very fragile, system can fry itself if left on it's side, slightly warped CD's can damage the lens and make huge gashes along the cd.. And there's only a handful of decent titles for it. All glitter and glitz and no substance. Still, if you're careful and you like it's titles, Sega Dreamcast has a great deal more support than Saturn did, and a much better archetecture... Now if they could just get all the bugs out."
5,Excellent console games...,"We're a 30-something couple who recently bought the Sega Dreamcast for our own gratification. It's a blast, although our constant complaint is that there's not enough games for it. (Of course.) We only want multiplayer games we can play with 2+ people and they are hard to come by, unfortunately. Our favorites so far are Sonic Adventure, Soul Caliber, and PowerStone - which we highly recommend. We wish the controllers were more comfortable... they don't have rubberized buttons and eventually hurt our fingers. Other than that, though, we appreciate the high level of interactivity, the beauty of the graphics, and the simplicity of the interfaces. It's a pretty good bang for your buck."
5,This system is highly underrated!,"I personally don't see why the PS2 is deemed so much better than Dreamcast. One, in my opinion, the Graphics, while maybe slightly simpler than PS2, are much smoother and realistic on Dreamcast, thanks to Anti-aliasing software on the dreamcast, which cuts down on the pixels that you see in many ps2 games. Plus, for 500 bucks, what it would cost to a ps2, a controller and 2 games, you could a dreamcast, 2 cool vmus (portable gaming systems and memory cards!) an extra controller, and 8 OR MORE GAMES! Plus there are millions of people ready ready to play you over the internet, and the hardware comes with internet ready gaming! How cool is that! It is a much better deal and a much underappreciated system! Dont pass this great deal up! You could do a lot worse with 80 bucks, the price of a couple of PS2 games!"
5,Sega is better than ps2,"I own a Dreamcast and Playstation 2 and I think Dreamcast is much better. PS2 is a bad design and graphics are not as clear as dreamcast. Dreamcast is a masterpiece, why they stop making them? Believe me, buy Dreamcast, don't waste money on s PS2."
5,A legend,"The Dreamcast is one of the gaming world's best legends. Must get two, one for collection and the other to play with!"
5,It is GREAT,I just want to say that I have enjoyed this system very much. It is easy to use. I have a 4 year old grandson that can even bet his mom and dad at games on this system and of course his grandma too. It is a shame that you don't make this product any more. Thanks for this game system It is used alot in my home. Looking to buy another one so that I have a spare or two around.
5,GO Dreamcast Go,I recently bought the Dreamcast and I am very happy with it. It is a fun system and the online capability is awesome. I don't have a PS 2 yet because of the crazy price. The price Dreamcast is going for is a no brainer. The graphics and gameplay are great. If you are having second thoughts just buy Soul Calibur and NFL 2K1 and your second thoughts will disappear. Get it now while the hardware is still available.
4,dreamcast rules!,"dreamcast has alot of good sides,but it does have some bad sides. sega was going to realease a dreamcast 2,but it was canceled. they are going to stop making dreamcast.but the graphics,the sound,and online stuff is just 100% great.this is the first disc system i ever had.people told me to wait and get a ps2 because of its little dvd player.ha!i have a $139.00 dvd player i bought myself and playes fine!the ps2 may have a little bit more graphics then dreamcast,but if you like ps2 just because of its dvd,just get a dvd player,and a dreamcast for an even lower price than ps2 combined!"
2,It is About the Games,"The Dreamcast system is a solid reliable capable game system, but lacks good games. Most games seem to be ported ps1 games with little or no graphic improvement. A few games (Headhunter, Sega 2k series sports, Shenmue, and Draconus) are beautiful graphically and close to, or even slightly better than the ps2 level. However, most games are terrible and a game system is only as good as the games it plays."
4,Good system,"This system was great for its time, but it can't contend with the systems of today. Anyone who thinks the Dreamcast is better than the PS2, the XBOX, or the Cube needs to get their brain examined. The PS2 is the best system out there right now, end of story. Dreamcast is a good system for Sega, but PS2 and friends totally destroy it."
3,I am soooooooo confused,"I really wanted to get a PS2. THan I gave in and bought a PSone. After reading the reviews, I am not sure what is going to be better. So I will be waiting a few more years before buying another console. I suggest you to do the same since new game consoles will be coming out. (I am waiting for PS3)"
5,This is a great system that had an unfortunate short life span,I've had this system since it came out and i love it. For the short amount of time it lived it put out an awesome assortment of great games! I just refurbished mine to restore it back to it's original state. I love this thing!
4,What Could Have Been...,"This was definitely a fun, great system to own. I got mine a few months after it came out and was instantly hooked on Sonic Adventure and couldn't put it down for months. It's just a shame the timing wasn't better (X-Box and PS2 came out later and blew Dreamcast out of the water) and more great games weren't released for it.I recently put my Dreamcast up for sale, along with all the games and accessories and I'll definitely be sad to see it go. I'm a poor, starving college student so I need the money."
3,Dreamcast Rules? Not So Fast.....,"When I purchased my Dreamcast, I was under the impression that I would not only be acheiving the highest in graphics and tehcnology, but in gameply as well. I had bought Sonic Adventure and had not been playing it for long before I realised what a brain dead game it was compared to the efforts of Shigeru Miyamato's Mario 64. Sure, the graphics may exceed Mario 64's but a huge lack of exploration, fun and QUALITY entertainment was what put me off the console. Even though this may only be one game, I still think Sega have lost their spot in the gaming market to the exceedingly ENTERTAINING consoles, The Nintendo 64 and The Playstation."
5,One Statement: Get It.,"I am 25 years old and when I touched this gaming system, it felt like I got my first NES 11 years ago. This system blows away PSX and N64 - forget about PSX2. You will get your money's worth from this system. Trust me!"
5,This system is da bomb. May it kick Sony's @$$ to hell!!!!!!,"I've only had my Dreamcast for 2 full days. If you thin playstation or playstation 2 is good, then you are dumber than the people who pay $100 more just to have sony printed on their electronics. Dreamcast is 15x as powerful as a playstation, 10x as powerful as a nintendo 64, and 4x as powerful as an intel pentium 2 processor. It includes a nice long phone cord and software for easy internet connection. Did I mention that it has a built-in 56K modem. Even the demo disc rocks. If you don't have the money for a game, this demo disc should keep you busy for awhile. I got Hydro Thunder and I will have to say that it is by far the best racing game that I've ever played. I'm also just days away from buying Sonic Adventure. What a game."
5,ITS A DREAM COME TRUE!,The Sega Dreamcast is a 128-bit system and is very powerful when you see the machine it is very small but heavey and feels very dueable unlike the n64 feels kind of cheap this is quality.I have tried 4 dreamcast games and they all have been A+ games.i have rented Dreamcast at hollywood video with sonic adventure and the game is very fast with 60fps and smooth graphics!the graphics are so good that they look like CG quality!the sound is awsome sonic finally talks and the gameplay is mario style but funner!there are tons of mini games and vmu games.the second one was ready 2 rumble with was at Eb and had awsome graphics and and will make you laugh when you hit them they get sores black eyes it is a must buy and i have tried powerstone and virtual fighter 3tb that you also must pre-order!the Dreamcast faster then the best computer and funner then psx and n64. dont get stuck on psx2 cause you are going to miss alot of fun on this system!
5,The Best System ever made.,"I still play the Dreamcast more then the Playstation 2, X-Box or Gamecube. I'll play it more then I would play with a Wii,PS3 or 360. The games are amazing, the system was well ahead of it's time and you will not find a better value for your gaming dollar then the Sega Dreamcast. In my opinion, I thought Skies of Arcadia was the best RPG on any system at the time, and it still holdsup well against all of todays newer RPG's. Shenmue was the most ambitious game ever developed, and between the local games and the import market there is well over 400 games available for the system and growing! Yes, games are still being made for the dreamcast by independent developers, and available for purchase online...many of which are very rare and valuable, since they are made in far smaller numbers. Do yourself a favor, take the $600 you would spend on a PS#, go out and get a dreamcast and about 3/4 of it's library...you can thank me later!"
1,dont waste your time,"God, what a disappointment. yeah the graphics are there but with all these other systems just over the horizon Id rather save my money. I rented this system from a local video store along with SC, the controllers are so fragile you feel like if you push the button too hard it will fall apart and the cd kept trying to load but it wasnt doing a very good job at it. nothing but a headache. I think I will wait for the Playstation 2. I could care less what the system looks like I just wanna see what it can do. its everything the dreamcast can do times 2. I just hope its not gonna have the structural flaws like dreamcast."
1,would you like to tell me what happen to the dream cast,dont send it to me because it was for my son for xmas and i dont think i will ever order and thing esle from you.............. thank you bridget kennard
1,hehehehehehehe,"Dreamcast was never a good system. It never had half-way decent games in my opinion, especially sports games and FPS. I mean, the only sports games they have is this nba and nhl 2k and 2k1 junk. No 989 or EA sports or even espn titles. PS2 has more NHL tiles right now than Dreamcast has ever had, and the PS2 isn't even 10 months old. Good things I bought a PS2 and not a Dreamcast."
1,The Death Of Sega,Sega does not even deserve a one star. The only good games for Sega is Sonic te Hedgehog. Sega announced the are making a deal with Nintendo to send Sonic to Nintendo. Sega has decided to give up to the competition. Finally. They will now only make games. I am happy for that. I am a Nintendo Fan. Zelda and Mario and I will be glad to see Soninc coming to Nintendo. Dreamcast starting in February will drop .... At the end of the year goodbye Sega. Now our only compettioor is that damn Playstation and the Xbox will compete. But Nintendo Rules
2,Don't waste your money.,"The dreamcast will be at the end of the ropes soon. From what I heard, Sega will no longer be making anymore systems and likely to stop making games for Dreamcast soon. I would not recommend purchasing this system. Save your money and purchase the PS2. I am still skeptical on Xbox. The specs looks like a pc you can pickup from dell. 733 celeron processor, nvidia video chip, 64mb memory, dvd rom, sound chip, and a 8 gig hard drive. From the sound of that I would be surprised if you don't get those blue screen error message that microsoft is known for. I would even be surprised if you don't need to upgrade your OS every year. Would you like to hear you kids say ""Mommy, look what happened. I got this fatal exception error on TV."" Normally error messages occurs on PC, not game systems."
3,Dreamcast,It came on time and it worked. Thank you. They sent me an extra game and an extra console just in case I needed parts. I'm grateful.
1,There is no point in buying it,Since they are going to stop making the Dreamcast then why buy it.It is just a waste of money.It has tite graphics but um not gonna buy somethin that is getting ready to stop.I would just get a PS2 or wait for X-BOX and the Gamecube.Its just not worth it unless you have that kind of money to waste.
4,Dreamcast,"why dont u just buy a Xbox,ps2 or a gc. Dreamcast has some games i like that is the only thing i like about it. ps2 is better, gc better and xbox bette. end of story"
3,Not worth buying something thats going to be obsolete,"Well it was just officially anounced today that Sega is going to quit producing Dreamcasts, so it would be crazy to buy one of these now. Your best bet is to wait until PSX2 games improve, or wait until the XBOX comes out and buy one of those systems."
1,This is one bad system!,"I thought it was going to be better then this, but it has nogood games and I gave it 1 star cause the grafics are very verygood. They should of waited a little longer"
1,Gamecube is better,Gamecube has online too. I JUST FIGURED IT OUT. Gamecube has more features in its games. Gamecubes work but the dreamcasts in stores don't. This has been a warning.
1,The Worst Thing Ever!!,"Dude! Dreamcast is not good. The graphics r worst than the big fat old Gameboy. Believe me and dont buy it. Its a waste of your money. When it first came out, I thought it was good so I bought it and then I found out that it stinks! Now I am sad. So believe me and dont waste you're money on this garbage. Peace Out!"
3,playstation2 v.s sega dreamcast,"sega dreamcast is great and all but if I had a choice I would go with A ps2 the graphics are mind blowing and if you want speed,clairity,and sound ps2 won't let you down!!By MARCH2001 A totaly 209 games will be availble and then will you want a dreamcast or A ps2???"
5,This System Kicks!,"The graphics are incredible, the features, including the 56k modem, 64 bit sound, 128 bit graphics, I'm getting giddy! This is what a system SHOULD be! And it's upgradeable, so it won't become obsolete really quick, like, say, the 64. If you don't have one of these pre-ordered, you'd better get moving and pick one up, pronto!"
5,Sega raises the bar again,"When Nintendo was the reigning company in the 8-bit market, Sega shocked the world with the release of the very first 16-bit console, raising the bar of the competition for the videogames market. Now, after some failed experiments, Sega does it again by launching the most impressive console ever made: the Dreamcast. It's fast. It's well-designed. But, the most important thing, it's FUN! Besides the wonderful number of accessories, the Dreamcast release includes awesome games from the best software houses, and lots of them. Those who choose the Dreamcast as their next console will not be disappointed, because this one's for real. Go get it!"
3,loads of fun and the most fluid graphics to date,"while the games i played on dreamcast were the best to date of any video game system, the controller is terrible. Far worse than the N64, and it doesn't even come close to the playstation. this alone makes it worth the wait for the next system to come out."
5,NBA 2K,this game is the best basketball game ever made..the graphic is so great....no other game compares to NBA 2K....
2,I'm returning it,"The first generation of games (NFL2K, Soul Calibur, and the like) were all first rate. The second generation has featured Crazy Taxi, which is mindlessly repetitive and boring; and NHL2K, which does not hold a candle to the earlier sports titles from Sega.PS2 will win the battle between the two consoles; Sega does not have the title support to justify the expense of this system. Sure, the Dreamcast hooks up to the 'net, but who cares? It can't handle Java and it doesn't have a printer hookup. Plus the Dreamcast's peripherals are too expensive, plus the Dreamcast can't play DVDs...Basically, there are a zillion positive reviews on this site for the Dreamcast, but as time goes on watch the reviews slowly start to get worse, as users learn to embrace reality - come the end of Summer 2000, the Sega Dreamcast will be obsolete."
2,Graphics aren't everything!,"I own a dreamcast and i can say i'm very dissapointed. sure the graphics rule, but thats it."
3,Not what I expected!!!,"At first I couldn't decide if I wanted a Sony Playstation 2 or a Sega Dreamcast. But then I thought ""Well, a Sony Playstation 2 has an audio CD player, DVD player, and of course a game console with stunning graphics, and great games!"" Now I ask you can a Sega Dreamcast do that? NOOOOO!!! All it is to me is a console that has boring games. So, now I have a Sony Playstation 2 in my room. And now I'm very satisfied. So, for you people out there who have a hard time dieciding go for the Sony Playstation 2!"
5,Sega's best effort in a long time.,"As a Sony and PC enthusiast.. the psx was and so far is the only game system that I had to have on release day (the psx2 will change that).. I am rather impressed with sega's dreamcast. TO be honest I bought this system on a whim.. lets face it the PSX is four years old and from my understanding the PSX2 will not really be available for another 1.5 years (system yes.. but games are hard to develop for it)... I decided what the hell give sega a chance. Soul Calibur is an awesome game. One of the 5 best fighters ever. Sonic is sweet and NFL2k is unbelievable. Sure, Sony PSX2 will be light years ahead of DC but it is also roughly 2 years younger and will be $150 more. So if you want a great system now (and can spare the money for your game addiction) do what I plan to do, give sega a chance and buy the PSX2 later."
5,"Power, Style, and Grace. Way ahead of it's time.","It is simply breathtaking, when it first came out it was so ahead of it's time some didn't beleve it could to what it was advertised to do. Unfortunetly it is becoming obsolete, but it was a fanaly worthy of Sega. The DreamCast came out before the N64, but it is almost as capible as the GC, and it rivals the PS2.There becomeing very hard to find, so if you own one of these, consider yourself lucky and hang onto it. In a hundred years it could be worth millions to some electronics antique shop<laughs>."
4,Best gaming system of all time,I think at first it hard just like any thing will be but its fun to have and learn on at a low price.
2,"DREAM CAST IS NOTHING BUT HYPE, WAIT FOR THE PSX2!!!!!","When I heard of Sega coming out w/ the Dream Cast I was excited but that excitement turned into dissapointment. Overall the Dream Cast was not much of an upgrade compared to the N64 or the PSX. The graphics and sound were only ok. Maybe I expected too much from this so-called ""revolutionary"" system, maybe not.The game Sonic Adventure was a pretty good game but it soon got boring after about 5 min. Bottom line is, the Dream Cast is an ok system, you're better off waiting for the PSX2.Again Sega has dissapointed me."
4,The real facts,Dreamcast is not tied with Xbox and PS2 or Gamecube at all. Two Segadream casts can fit inside of Xbox. I mean SEGA should install a broadband and Dial-up modem. I mean the games have poor graphics. Don't waste your money on this system. I mean it has OK graphics. But the 128-bit doesn't mean anything. The CPU witch stands for (CENTRAL PROCESSOR UNIT) controls the graphics. Dreamcast is out of busnius. They have like 89 Games left or a little more. My friends were so right
3,Is OK,"This is an ok system but I think I could have spent my money on something else. I think that more stuff should have been included, at least one vmu."
5,The Best,"I love it, it is the best system on the market today and will be for a long, long time. Playstation 2 is the worst system that you can get. I tried it and the controller is the same as it used to be. The Dreamcast rules buy at all cost. The games rule and it is a great system."
5,Dreamcast is great,"I got a dreamcast 6 months ago and I am still having fun with it. Everything about is is so inexpensive now, with controllers (...) and games! Save packs(...). The whole thing is so cheap that I couldn't resist getting one. And how I do love it. It has a big games selection, with all sorts of games for a wide audience. The graphics are still excellent, and far cheaper than the X-box, Gamecube or PS2. For the price of one of these systems, in fact, you could buy a Dreamcast with 4 controllers, a save pack, and 3-5 games. I really do love this system even though one of my friends thinks it's bad (but he plays it more than any of my other friends!). I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great system for an amazing price."
4,a good gaming system,"Sega dreamcast promises to be the most powerful gaming system in the world. With its awsome 3d graphics and lighting quick gameplay, it truly is. If you are interested in hardcore gaming, dreamcast is right for you. Plus, it's internet connection allows it to expand into the internet, making it a truly universal game system."
3,"A great system, but not so great games","I bought this system around the year of 2000. It then stopped making it three months after I got it.Pros: Great Graphics, Easy to use controllers, Cheap, a good first game system.Cons: Breaks down constantly, Dosen't have many games, Not made anymore."
1,one word; GAMEPLAY,"gameplay is all that matters, and so far, all the games have to show for themselves are graphics. Wait until better games come out until you shell out $ on an OVERHYPPED ""LOSER""."
1,Another flop,"I am an avid gamer and ad all you gamers know it is best to go out and get the newest version with realistic graphics and clear sound. Well I went out and was extremely dissapointed by the overrating everyone gave the dreamcast. There is nothing special here, and besides that SEGA has lost most of thier contracts with game producers and we all know what happen when SEGA came out with the SEGA CD, 32x, etc. etc. My advice stick with N64 and Playstation."
1,TOO BAD SEGA,i have both ps2 and dreamcast and i only play ps2 cause the games are awesome in ps2 ..all good games of sega are now in playstation 2 with better Graphics..The controller of the dreamcast [are terrible]..too badnever evan think of comparing dreamcast with ps2..
1,playstation 2 vs. Dreamcast,ok im no dreamcast fan because it is no good and isn't better than playstation 2 and i have am going to prove it. Dreamcast a small little bad machine with 3 million polygons per second (bad)it may have more games but not for long and the graphics cant compare. playstion 2: 66 million polygons per second (raw) has space for a hardrive pcmcia card (for modems) a firewall port and 2 usb ports bigger and better with better games and allows more players with a multitap
1,PS2 will now have most of the best Dreamcast games...,"FACT #1: SEGA is dropping Dreamcast. FACT #2 SEGA is now developing the best Dreamcast games for PlayStation 2, and a whole slew of new ones.. INCLUDING VIRTUA FIGHTER 4!!! The long debate is over. SONY's PS2 comes out on top hands down. :) Don't waste your money on the soon to be dead Dreamcast people, the games will look 100x better now that they are being made for PS2 anyways. ..."
3,"A Good System, But Will Soon Just Be Another Good Ol' Memory","The DC is a great system, rate now. Unfortionitly, Playstaition2 is just under a year away and it is already set to blow the DC away. If that wasn't anough, Microsoft just anounsed there new game system (X-Box) wich could actulaly be more powerfull than PS2! I would only recomend the DC if- 1.) Your a hardcore gamer who needs to be technilogicly up to date. AND/OR 2.) You cant wait till September for Playstaition2"
3,What I did with my Sega Dreamcast,"I bought a Dreamcast and rented Skies of Arcadia and Grandia 2 for 2 weeks. Beat both of the games and carried the games back to Blockbuster and carried back the Dreamcast to the store.Take my advice, buy a PS2 or wait for Game Cube. Skies of Arcadia and Grandia 2 are the only good games."
5,The best ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have only played one game (Sonic Adventures), but it totaly blew me away! It has stunning graphics and an awsome frame rate. It is very easy to learn and it is a must to buy. The neatest thing aboout it is the VMU. I like the mini-games and taking care of the characters and then fighting them with my friends. I love this system so much that I could call it my friend too!"
5,This is an INCREDIBILE SYSTEM.,The Sega Dreamcast has outdone every other video game system out there. You can not even compare it to the N64 or the Playstation. I have both of those systems and the Dreamcast is in an entire league of its own. This system is a purchase you will not regret.
5,The best system ever,"When I purchase my Sega Dreamcast I fell in love with it. I stop playing my Playstation and Nintendo ,and graphic's are non-stop pounding. If you buy this system believe me you wont be sorry."
5,The Greatest 128 bit system that ever lived,"This is the best 128 bit system period! People love to dis it for its so called ""inferior"" graphics and bad games but the truth is that the graphics are superb and there are numerous wonderful games for it. Dreamcast was the first to go totally online and in this respect it is still undeniably the BEST. Many of the Dreamcast's best games have been ported over to either the Gamecube, Xbox, or PS2 but if at all possible buy them on the Dreamcast, they are best on the original. We TRUE gamers will always remember you Dreamcast, you are still alive in our hearts."
3,"Could have been a LOT better, but it's ok.","Well, folks, its here. I bought 10 games along with my system, played them all and was fairly impressed. But, they are lacking the dvdrom system which in the longrun will hurt them. And the idiots who think you can upgrade this system to dvdrom are crazy, it'll cost you at least 150 to upgrade in the future.The lack of speed in the system will also be a hindrance in the future, sony and nintendo are delayed because they've added a faster microprocessor with rambus technology to the system. It will clock in 10x the rate of the Dreamcast. Dreamcast will not be able to handle the sheer speed of dvd, the processor would literally fry. I'd hold off on this one if you haven't bought it already. It might be fun, but in a year, you'll be buying a psx2 anyways. Also, the psx2 is cross compatible with the psx1.Think about this one, don't jump on the bandwagon."
5,The Great System Everyone has Forgotten,I think The Sega Dreamcast Died to soon but i understand and know why if you have never played this system before its got over 248 great games titles avail and has internet access with online gameplay capapbilties if your still playing your old PS1 give this system a shot it will be one of the best 40 dollars or under that you probably ever spend (though when i bought mine back awhile for like 129 Dollars year 2000 well good luck hope there is others out there that agree. Other then that if Sega Would have never made this wonderful system we would all probably just playing with our best friends on the couch there the ones who brought online gaming where is today besides PS2 Didn't Have Online gaming access when if first came out we had to wait about a year even Xbox had trouble getting theres started Gamecube took them awhile to so don't bring down a great system its old yes but don't frown upon a system that brought us to where we are today long live Sega !!!
3,"Fun, but doomed to be a gonner","Dreamcast is the first intro into the new console arena. It's fun, but wait for the new Sony system. Once again Sega will be blown out of the market it benchmarked just like the Saturn. If you want high def. titles, use a PC. Then get the new Sony system that will have DVD compatability."
5,"This should be good, 'cause I did it for $100.00",This new sega console that has made many children saving/demanding money is about to come. How can this one litte game system pack a whole lot of power? It comes with an internal 56k modem that allows you to play other game freaks all over the world. I like this because it means I don't have to go to some movie theatre with coke stains on the floor just to play Marvel vs Capcom. Instead I just stay in my clean relaxing home and play the game for free!!! I still don't like that these game console that is CD format have to load unlike the nintendo consoles. CD has better graphis but it has to load but cartridge games are faster so it doesn't have to load but it has poorer graphics than CD. I am patient so i doesn't matter. The DreamCast has all these new nifty accessories like the one hand-held game system that can save your game and play mini games too...
1,This system stinks!,"The reason why it stinks is because the games for it all stink like sonic, sonic, and more sonic. Sega makes bad games. There are no educational games for it either. And CD's are easily scratched which doesn't help with durability. But I do say it does have good graphics."
3,ok...for now,"this system is no different to me than the others that Sega has introduced - big splash, but few games to play on the system. do any of you remember the '32x', or saturn systems? i do. i was sucked into buying them and was left hanging by Sega (the games never came). be smart - wait until the PX2 comes out next year."
1,Faded Out...,"This is crazy. Dreamcast came out, what, a couple yars ago???? And now there stopping production??? Typical Sega. Look at the 64 and the Playstation one. Both of these have been out for about 5 years now and they're still doing great. So what happen to Dreamcast? It just faded out like the rest of their consoles. I was debating on whether to get a PS2 or a DC about a couple months ago. Good thing I bought the PS2. I believed all of those DC fanatics who said the DC was ""here to stay"" and was the ""best console to date."" Good thing I didn't buy any of it."
2,Hmmmmmmmmmm,"Look, here's the deal. If you like Dreamcast, great, if your not sure what console to buy right now, save for the PS2. Their library of games is growing stronger and Dreamcast doesn't make alot of games, second the price is going to be lowered, and third the Dreamcast has no future in the upcoming months compared to what PS2 is going to be dishing out. That's all for now."
3,Sorry for saying this to Dreamcast;s fans... but../,"I was going to buy Dreamcast,... but, I heard people keep sayingthat Dreamcast breaks a LOT.I gave 3 stars because I haven't used it Yet.Thank you for pay attentioning!"
2,OK,"ok, to tell you the truth I have a Dreamcast. I've played a PS2 and it's lots o fun. The games are great and there will be more out. When Sony drops the price im gonna buy one and sell my Dreamcast and play PS2. For some reason I just kinda like PS2 better and all my friends do to. They all say that Dreamcast is out of date, and that it will be blown away in the months to come. I don't agree with them fully. Dreamcast is good, I just like Ps2 better."
3,I am cofused,I am asking for advice since I cannot get email addresses. Especially from someone who knows about the difference between PS2 and dreamcast. I was ready to buy a PS2 but after reading some reviews I am confused and ready to now buy a Dreamcast. So please someone help me with this tough decision. I would like to hear from Matt N. Thank You. I will continue to read this website. I appreciate any feedback.
2,The End for Dreamcast,The Dreamcast is a waste of money. Why spend $100 on a console that they are going to stop making games for soon. The only reason why it got 2 stars is because it has nice graphics and about 5 games that are good. DreamCast and PlayStation 2 good and bad points:DreamCastGood Points: -$100 consoloe price -Lots of $20 games -Nice graphics -Four Players without extra hook-upsBad Points: -No more new games coming out ever -Memory cards dont hold enough saved games -Most games are boring -Doesn't play DVDs -Cant't play old Saturn games -Controller doesn't have built-in rumblePlayStation 2Good Points: -Plays DVDs -Plays old PlayStation games -Great graphics -Lots of old PlayStation games are $20 -Controller has built-in rumbleBad Points: -$300 console price -Not many games out right nowBuy a PlayStation 2. You'll be glad you did.
1,Wait for PlayStation 2,"PlayStation 2 is slated for release this winter, so I just don't see why I'd want the Dreamcast. To give you an idea: one Japanese Dreamcast magazine has this top-10 best selling Dreamcast game ranking. Well, this one issue had the top game selling something like 8000 copies in a month. Well, when Final Fantasy VII (for Playstation only) came out in Japan, they sold over a million copies in 2 weeks. PlayStation 2 will be compatible with Playstation 1 games, so you'd be able to play them all. Plus, it's based on DVD, not CD-ROM like the Dreamcast. The Dreamcast is undoubtably the best hardware in town right now, but that's going to change in a matter of months, and then you'll feel burned again by Sega.I just don't think Sega has what it takes to battle Sony and Nintendo. Plus, Playstation 2 will have much, much, much better graphics capability than Dreamcast (70 million polygons/sec on Playstation 2 vs. 5 million polygons/sec on Dreamcast...that's some difference!)"
3,Eh...,"I agree with most other people, the Dreamcast has the best graphics ever on a console system (but shouldn't it anyways..?). The only problem is, soon, Playstation 2 and Dolphin are going to ship, and Dreamcast will be left in the dust. Dreamcast feels more like a half-next-gen console. Get it if you can afford to buy a PS2 or Dolphin in the future, but if you can't, pass."
2,Wait for Playstation 2,"Sega has done a wonderful job in marketing the Dreamcast. Theconsole itself is very powerful and fast, capable of astounding framerates, 3d graphics and cool sounds. However, there is one thing lacking, which Sega forgot: gameplay.What's the point in paying $200 for a machine with no games? When it was released on 9/9/99, Sega had about a dozen games. 4 months later there are only 30-35 games. I've had the pleasure and displeasure of playing most of them, and in my honest opinion, 95% of them are not worth paying $40-50. For every great game like Soul Calibur, there are duds like Fighting Force 2, Armada, Dynamite Cop and Slave Zero. Sure the games look good, but where's the gameplay? How long did it take you to finish Dynamite Cop or grow tired of Soul Fighter?"
4,Good game system,"The Sega Dreamcast is a brilliant video game system. The graphis it creates using it Hitachi Sh4 processor are truly amazing. The controller fit nocly into you hand. The device itself is small, and does not take up to much space. The sound is good too. All these features amount to a winner. I have a few problems with my Dreamcast, though. First of all, the GD-ROM drive sounds like a blender. I don't know if the problems lies only in my one, or other too. Another thing is the fact that the games are good, but a bit similar. Most of the games are good, but the follow the same theme. I want to see more games like Donkey Knog 64, and so forth. Otherwise, this is a brilliant system. Buy it, and you won't rgeret it."
3,An ok game system,"I understand that dreamcast was the best gaming system back then. But how come there's no screen for it. For a 128 graphicsit would turn out well. Dial up internet, Well I think that this system should have broadband like Xbox,GameCube,PS2. Itstill works fine. Anyhow thats my letter."
5,Never seen anything like it before,"I've been playing with this console for about half a year. Let me tell you that anyone speaking against this console obviously does not know what he/she is talking about. PS2000 and Dolphin will only come out about a year after DC, so they're not really comparable. It's nice to know that PS2000 and Dolphin will be able to do more than DC, but what do you play until these two come out? The software lineup for DC is just great! If you've been playing Soul Calibur you'll know what I mean. Never has a console been closer to actual arcade game. AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!!!"
4,A system with mind blowing graphics and fun games,"This system runs on 128-bits and it is like the arcade brought to you. Basically, they took most of the arcade games and put it onto DC. For example, Soul Caliber, Hydro Thunder, and House of the Dead 2. Now if you heard they said that Soul Caliber was improved and it looks better on DC than in the arcade. Jus put it as a mini arcade."
4,Dreamcast Ruls!,"I recintly got a dreamcast for my birthday.when i opened it i was so suprised.Dreamcast has a very good looking disine.A disine that would capture anyone's eye.To me the dreamcastis flawless. It's grahpics ar simply amazing when compared toplaystation, and nintendo 64. It has four controller ports.Wich can be very usful. And playstation 2 only has two controllerports. Sony acually wants you to invest some more money for amulti tab. Even after you bout a 300$ machine. Plus the dreamcast doesn't cost that much, and the games are very fun!!!! Here are my favorite games for the system and the ones i think are the funest. SONIC ADVENTURE, SONIC SHUFFLE, SONIC ADVENTURE 2,CRAZY TAXI, CRAZY TAXI 2, FUR FIGHTERS, MSR, SEGA GT, SPEED DEVILS, NFL 2K1, WORLD SERIES BASEBALL 2K2, KAO THE KANGAROO, AND RAY MAN 2. DREAMCAST IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMING CONSOLES EVER!"
5,Come on give it a rest,I have a SEGA Dreamcast and its the best better then PS on eonly needs more games. so all you out there rushing to get a PS2 are just wasteing your money the only difference between the SEGA Dreamcast and PS2 is the processor Dreamcast has a 200mhz CPU and PS2 has a 300mhz CPU wich is jus loader unless has the right hardware in it GO OUT GET A DREAMCAST AND BE HAPPY they will make more games and every one knows it so dont be thck headed and get a DREAMCAST.
4,Its good while it lasts,"It is a great system; however, it is kind of unreliable.I only played the system for two years, thats when a controll did the damage on it. (those darn unofficial sega conntrolers)Also, my freind owned one. He told me a spark shot out of his while he was playing. Due to the lack of blockbuster rentals, the system became boring..."
4,Nice little timer for the money,"I use this for timing holiday lights in the winter and a pond pump in the summer. BTW, programming instructions may be found at: http://www.hardwareinnovations.com/pdf/SA_210_IB61056_33.pdf"
4,It'll fit your bill 85% of the time,"I use this timer for powering three aquarium lights: two are compact fluorescents, and the third is an LED moon light. The LED is always on, via the third receptacle, while the two PC lights operate on the timer function. I like that you can set your zip code and it turns the lights on and off at sunrise/sunset for me. I can also set specific on/off times, such as during the winter when I want more 'day' hours to view my fish.I like that it handles 15A, and has two sockets for my lights, but I do wish the different sockets had different timer settings. Another shortcoming is that while it does have 4 program modes, I have only been able to manually switch between the modes. I lost my instruction manual and I think you can have all 4 modes work throughout the day though. It is a little tricky to program without a manual, but you should be able to figure it out."
2,hard to set,i have been trying for days to set this real complicated timer no mater how i set it it don't work for the price i paid it sucks.
1,watch out below,"I finally replace this rack with one with solid sides. We had spices fall several times out the sides, especially from the wider lower shelf. When a glass spice jar took out the pottery on the counter it was time for it to go."
1,Dangerous - can burn down your house and kill linemen,This is not a real transfer switch. Instead it gangs ordinary breakers with a metal bar. When I tested it the bar slipped and the generator was left BACKFEEDING into the utility - that kills linemen and burns down homes.
5,"Brilliant, eloquent, poetic, deeply moving.","David Weiss has written a profound memoir of a difficult encounter with people and his past. It is eloquent, brilliant, deeply moving and eminently readable."
2,Star of David Pewter Cuff Bracelet,"Was disappointed all around, sorry to say. The bracelet was not formed with the bias of the wrist; The metal was not thick enough or formulated with enough base metal to withstand body heat so it constantly lost shape and loosened - the design could be seen from the underside/inside. But more importantly it quickly cracked and broke from the edge to one of the star's because of the above reasons as well as, apparently, from not having a thick enough border/edge. Also, upon arrival even one of the star's had already lost it's blacking. However, I liked the idea; If manufacturer recalculated the design I'd try to purchase it again...."
1,This does not work--I have 2 of them,"I love apples, but I warn you not to buy this product. I bought 2 for 2 differnet ibooks in 2 different locations. The wireless worked fine for the first 6 months, but has stopped. The problem is most likely in the software, since the problem happened in both systems. There is an Apple discussion board on-line through Apple that has over 500 posts discussing this issue. Apparently Apple has no idea about how to fix it. So, save your money and don't buy this product. I wish it would work--but it does not."
1,Good Luck,"Good luck if you are planning on using it with a Windows PC wireless network. I spent 4 hours trying to get it to recognize my linksys router. When it's hard wired the unit works fine, wireless no go. Just sits and blinks orange. Apple stuff doesn't seem to like windows so I'm going to save $120 and buy a simple audio cable. Apple was absolutely no help!"
2,Needs a lot of work,"Great concept, but definetly doesn't work half of the time. I wanted to use the Airport Express as a travel access point. Every time you plug it in expect at least 30 min to an hour to set up the damn thing. The Airport Express DOES NOT work right outside of the box. You cannot plug it into the wall and have it work. You must configure it first which takes a minumum of 20 minutes. Also once it is working, the wireless signal drops once every 5-10 minutes. My AIM would get disconnected in these outages and I would have to sign back online constantly. Also if you want to use it as a print server, be advised it only works with an approved list of printers. It DOES NOT work with every printer. I think this product works better with Macs. My work laptop is a Windows machine. Again cool concept, but expect it not work to work half of the time in a Windows environment."
2,Not worth the price.,"The Apple AirPort Express has several drawbacks.1. It only extends the range of existing AirPort networks and will not extend the range for your Netgear, Linksys, D-Link, or any other router.2. It is a pain to setup for wireless printing if on Windows operating systems.3. Sending your ITunes music to your stereo requires additional components which are of course sold seperately.The bottom line is that you can find a cheaper product that works better. So avoid the hype and look elsewhere."
3,"Too Pricey, but Three and a Half","I bought the Airport Express along with my Powerbook last month and couldn't wait to try it out. Visions of me printing and jamming from across my house flew through my head as I waited, patiently, for my order to cross the Pacific.I didn't experience any of the problems other reviewers have with setup, but I have found that it is very touchy with security and can be a little confusing to use with encryption on, especially introducing other (non-Airport card) computers to it.The transmission range is very small, that was a major disappointment. The extra features are fun but not exclusive and certainly not worth the $60+ difference in price from other routers. I'm sure if you can spend $120 to add this on to your existing network you will love it, but I just can't justify the price (too late) for use as your primary router."
5,Great Product - PC User,"Following the steps indicated by other reviewers here (also can be found on the Apple Support site) resulted in getting the Airport Express working with my existing PC-based wireless network in minutes, despite having an initial setup issue with the basic instructions. This product works exceptionally after setup- perfectly fit my need to manage music on my PC and play it on my stereo system. I couldn't be more pleased."
3,AE with ITunes,Got this to stream music from ITunes on Labtop to remote speakers of stereo. Just have to say that set up was easy. Set back was that after it was installed I found out that the connection is skipping since upgrade to ITunes 8. Problem is with ITunes and the company does not provide any support for this issue. With music dropping in and out this set up is not working any longer.
5,Excellent Wireless Router/Printer Server/Media broadcaster,"I bought the AirPort Express a couple years ago. I paid a little more for this than other similar Netgear or Linksys product. But this unit takes up less room and had a built-in USB port for printer. I used it for a long time only as a wireless router because my old HP printer didn't have USB connection and it refused to die. I plugged in a set of speakers to the AirPort just to try it out. Change a few setting in iTune, and I got music from another room. It was so easy! Then a few months ago, I bought a Canon MFP600 all-in-one printer. First I set it up with the printer connected to my PowerBook. Everything worked the first time. Then I unplugged the printer, and connected it to the AirPort Express, immediately I was able to find the printer through the wireless network. Effortlessly! It is beautifully design. It is portable. I will buy it again if I need to upgrade in the future."
4,Finally Works Great with My Mac Network (even if a bit pricey),"I pre-ordered this, because I needed EXACTLY this capability to stream from iTunes to my stereo system. I had endless problems initially, as it would lose it's programming after, say, a week or two and I'd have to do the tedious set-up all over again. I even returned one to Apple, and still had the same problem.All changed when I updated the firmware about 3 months ago. Now everything works great. One of my slower computers (800MHz iMac) lacks processing power and does not support Airport Extreme. When I stream using this computer the music sometimes annoyingly cuts out. Not sure if this is due to processing power or non-Extreme limitations. Faster computers using Airport extreme don't have this problem."
3,Dont buy this 4yr old version,"Be an informed buyer. Note that M9470LL was first available June 14, 2004!!.Be sure to get the newest version (Apple part number MB321LL/A) which has 802.11n and NOT this item (Apple part number M9470LL/A) which is 802.11a/b only."
1,"Tedious setup, good product","I am posting this update to my previous review:Setting up the airport express was very hard. It took me two frustrating days to get it working.If you have XP2 on your computer, make sure you download the firmware and airport express assistant updates from Apple. These are required if you want wireless security(WEP). After I applied these updates my setup went through smoothly. The airport express works perfectly now.Radioshack has the optical Y-cable for $7.I initially had problems with music skipping. Turning on an option called ""Enable Interference Robustness"" solved the problem nicely and I have not had skips in the music ever since.I had given this product one star in a very frustrated moment"
2,Disappointing....product from Apple,"Couldn't set up from my Windows 2K laptop. Could see the SSID of the Airport Express but could never get pass it onto the internet. The Administration config utility never worked for me either. This is my first Apple product....and I was expecting simplicity and plug+play from Apple...but alas this was not to be. Maybe I had a defective one....tried a Netgear WGR101 Travel Router for $79, plugged it in, changed my SSID to match and was on the internet in 3 minutes. The Apple has an elegant compact all in one design, plus the power plug flips down for storage. The Netgear is tiny as well but comes with a separate plug-in pwr supply. The Apple for $129 vs $79 for the Netgear was too much of a value gap to swalllow. So for now I'll say Apple you're fired...Netgear you're hired!"
5,I don't understand all the problems!!,"perhaps these people own a pc and that's the problem, but i took me 5 minutes to set up airport extreme...if you own a mac, it's a very user-friendly product. i plugged it into the wall socket, connected my ethernet cable, printer, and music jack, turned on my computer and the airport card found it right away. After setting up the passwords, i had itunes playing music over to my stereo, i was printing, and surfing the net. my advice to all those pc users, get a mac...aside from the ""prettiness"" of it, they are the best computers i've ever used...os x makes it easy and i'll never go back!"
1,Be aware that you need Mac OS X v10.3 to configure it,"This is yet another trick Apple has found to force Mac users to upgrade to their latest OS. If you don't have ""Mac OS X v10.3 or later"" (i.e. your Mac is more than 6 month old), you won't be able to install the AirPort Express Assistant utility and configure the AirPort Express. My PowerBook is only a year and a half old. It runs Mac OS X v10.2.8, and I'm very happy with it. It has a wireless card from Cisco and works fine in most of wireless networks, including those based on Apple technology. In other words I can use my PowerBook with the AirPort Express, but I first need to configure the AirPort Express. For that, I must have my PowerBook run Mac OS v10.3 (Panther), and that's a $129 upgrade. Bottom line: the cost of the AirPort Express is $258 if your Mac is more than 6 month old."
1,One bad apple,"WARNING TO iTUNES USERS: This product may serve very well as a short-range wireless router, but as a device to deliver iTunes to your stereo, it falls flat. The problem is interference from 2.4Ghz digital phones. If you have one in your home, this product is all but guaranteed to fail. (It took me three returns, countless computer hours, and four long phone calls to Apple help before this was confessed to me.) Once unplugging my phone, it seemed to work fine for a while, but then the pauses started. While a split second pause may go unnoticed if you are surfing the web, if you are playing music it is impossibly annoying. It seems baby monitors and fluorescent lights also cause problems, though not as severe as 2.4Ghz phones. Buyer beware."
1,no luck,"Despite the good advice below, I never got the solid green light, only a flashing amber, which indicated the unit could not find the network. So after an hour or more putzing around with resets and so forth, gave up and returned it."
1,Nightmare,"This steaming pile of poo is on its way back to Amazon. I wish that I had thought this purchase through more carefully, given the extremes in the reviews. I got it to work after a lot of research and frustration, and after all that the streaming music cuts out every few seconds, and it unit dies completely every few minutes. I spent hours tweaking the settings before I came to my senses and realized I'd be a lot happier with my dough back."
2,Don't bother ordering this item,"If you absolutely must have one for a gift, don't buy it her at Amazon. First problem, the success rate for prompt delivery on this item is poor. Don't believe what is advertised. They will charge your card and simply not ship. Two to Three weeks is insane anytime of year, but during the Christmas season it is unacceptable. There is no one to contact, no one to call, no one to email. In short, no one cares. As you might guess, this is not the way to win customers but as an individual, we just don't matter to these big companies."
4,I want another one!,"Set it up in minutes, streaming music from iBook to stereo with ease. This is a simple, elegant product, and a perfect mate for a wireless-capable laptop. Some complain of the lack of a remote control... for me, the iBook IS the remote. Maybe a less-ideal match for someone with a desktop system.My only wish is for the ability to stream to two AirPort Express units at a time, for true wireless multi-room sound capabilities. I'd by another one the minute they add that functionality to iTunes. (I'm sure it's only a matter of time)."
5,Airport rocks with ibook g4,I use airport with my psp and ibook with this and I love it! It was Kinda hard to set up so someone did it for me but once it was set up it rocks! I have airport express with the griffin airbase and that rocks too! I am not sure about pc but This rocks with mac!If you have a ibook/powerbook and want a good home network Airport express is for you!
3,"Good, but could be better",I purchased this to stream audio in another room connecting to a Linksys wireless router. It's easy to install and works well with iTunes. The sound quality is good except streaming audio has it's moments where the audio skips. Different WiFi channels seem to be better than others. Client WiFi mode is only supported for third party routers. I hope they'll fix that in v.2.
3,Windows Users Beware,"Windows users will spend 8 to 12 hours making this product work, 3/4 of that time researching on the Apple website, and 1/4 time actually trying to get it to work. You'll find that the WEP key standards may not match what you can define on your router, which will further complicate the installation. And, when you finally get it installed, you might not know what you did right, which will mean you'll never want to touch it again. You'll also never want to change routers, because that'll mean you have to reconfigure.On the other hand, if you really need to beam music to a place you can't wire, this is the greatest. Compact and hidden. Having reconfigured it multiple time (and taken Apple's name in vain each time), I can tell you that this product is both wonderful, and a pain in the a*s.Buyer beware!"
4,Once setup was complete...,"I absolutely recommend M. Favazza's review for anyone setting up with a PC. I had tons of problems trying to set up with the CD, but once I followed his/her directions to a T, everything worked perfectly. PC users, go read that review!Once I got it set up, it works great - sound quality is wonderful and I haven't had any problems with any cordless phone or other interference."
3,Installation Help,"Took me 3 hours to install. Here are the lessons learned:1. Plug it in to an outlet and wait 1 full minute. Ignore the status lights.2. Connect the ethernet to a router outlet. Wait until the light turns green.3. Install the CD but 'cancel' out of the assistant.4. Turn on your wireless laptop and immediately go to apple.com/support/airport and upgrade to the latest Airport and Firmware update to the latest version. This is essential.5. Don't use assistant, use the Admin Utility.6. Use the Apple User-Contributed Help Forums. Without it I never would've gotten anywhere.Worth the hassle. This stuff is cool."
2,"Good, but not great","Yeah, its okay... It has a lot of nice features... Yet it does randomly stop working like every other router out there. Please apple, before you charge 2x more than all the rest, make sure that your product is BETTER than them. My old linksys worked better than this one..."
4,Versatile and reliable once installed,"I have a multi-platform, WPA2-encrypted network on a Linksys WRT54GL router running the DD-WRT firmware, and this piece of hardware works great once installed properly.Beware that the ""wireless repeater"" functionality that extends your wireless network was only intended for use with Airport Extreme, but... with a little googling you can find detailed instructions on how to set it up to extend a Linksys 54G network. It's just a bit more complicated than most would wish, but that's the price to pay for not getting the overpriced Airport Extreme base station.If you're not really tech-savvy and just want to pipe your music to remote speakers, it works fine and the setup isn't really that complicated."
3,Instable at times,"I purchased the Airport Express a little over a year ago. The product concept is wonderful, but its execution is slightly less so.My main problem is the frequency by which the Airport will lose its connection. My music will cut out during songs like a skipping cd, which is extremely irritating. Oftentimes, I'll have to stop what I'm doing, close everything on which I'm working, and restart my PC. This usually helps, as does limiting the number of programs I'm running.I agree, the set-up was rough. There are plenty of resources here to help you through it. And I also agree that support from the manufacturer was virtually nonexistent.If you can tolerate its minor problems and be patient with its flaws, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you want a product that you won't have to troubleshoot every couple of times you use it, maybe wait for the next generation of the Airport Express."
4,"Yes, the documentation sucks...","...and running my microwave seems to hamstring its reception, but mostly it connects, and works just fine, with my iMac about 40 feet and several walls away. I can't actually speak to its printer-sharing, but have you checked out the cost of print-servers lately? It has made the sub-woofer and speakers attached to my living room tv much more of an asset, and I can see moving them, and it, out onto the deck this summer for au naturel rocking out."
2,Very Disappointed with Apple,"First Apple product in years. I was excited for thoughtful and useful technical design, simple interface etc. I am terribly disappointed and will sell on ebay unless there's a firmware update in a hurry. Why? Well:Pros:1. Small2. Nice Aesthetic3. Streaming audio (a nice bonus, but not my focus)Cons:1. No Mac address cloning (so it's only worked in 1 out of 12 hotels I've tried it at. This was one of the primary reasons I bought the device)2. Almost impossible to use as a wired bridge (the second reason I bought the device)3. Configuration software is confusing and unituitive4. Documentation is unclear5. No carrying case (not that important, but annoying)6. Somewhat unstable and requires frequent soft resets to fully utilize profiles."
4,"Simple set up on Macs, BUT...","If you use Mac OSX 10.3.9 or any flavor of 10.4.x, make sure you unplug any ethernet cable from your Mac BEFORE you use ""AirPort Setup Assistant"" in the Utilities folder. I didn't, and could not get internet access through my cable modem--although, USB-printing and Airtunes-to-remote-speakers worked just fine. Maybe this is noted somewhere but it took me a couple hours of head-scratching to make it work. After I ""unplugged"" both my iMac and my Pismo the Set-up Assistant worked just fine--with set-up taking less than two minutes."
4,good for streaming music from a pc and a linky ap,"...but read the apple.com support forums before calling support.bit of a tough time trying to get ape to work with linky wrt54g and wpa. apple ts not helpful, apple forums very much so (hardwire, use aiport config not ape util, config and get working before unwiring)."
1,Don't count on it!,"I purchased the product and was forced to return it due to network connectivity issues. Unfortunately this device appears to lose the wireless connection and will reset far too often to be considered a viable means of sending music from one room to another. Also the installation documentation is not as clear as possible. I had to scour the Internet to find out that regardless of your wireless configuration, the airport MUST initially be hooked up to your router via ethernet cable. If this step is missed, a wireless connection will never happen."
1,Not for Windows XP users,"It takes a network expert to make it work with Windows XP (check out Apple forums about it). Music is automatically turned off on your PC when you want to stream music (and there is no way you can change that). Impossible to stream to 2 differents airports at the same time. Very disapointing, sending two of those back to the shop."
3,"""Airtunes"" only works 50% of the time","THE GOOD NEWS: It's a great little throw and go to take to a hotel that offers broadband in the room - Your laptop is unleashed!THE BAD NEWS: The ""airtunes"" feature is constantly ""breaking"". Half the time, iTunes says it's not compatible with the ""speakers"" plugged into the express, or it can't find the speakers. You'll be listening to your music and suddenly it will drop off and then can't reconnect, or won't connect in the first place. The only solution is to unplug the Express, plug it back in, restart your computer and then... cross your fingers.This would be a five star product if it was more reliable."
2,Seriously messed up my router configuration,I tried to install this thing and it messed up my router configuration. I couldn't get online until I chatted with Linksys support to get it back up. I didn't want to take the chance of messing it up again.
2,"Works great for some, but not for me","I have the dreading 5 second drop out problem, aka skipping, that makes this device totally useless for playing music through my stereo. If you are one of the lucky ones, it should work great. If you are one of the unlucky ones, it will be awful. Do you feel lucky ?"
5,Amazing little gadget!,"I've just discovered the wonders of WiFi and couldn't be happier. The side of the box that the Airport Express comes in lists 3 simple steps to getting connected. I was a bit skeptical, but it really was that easy. I had my PowerBook connected to my cable internet, printer, and stereo in under 5 minutes. Everything works seamlessly. Highly recommended."
4,Lousy Instructions for Windows But I Got It To Work,"Four stars because of terrible instuctions. I tried for hours until I realized I needed to set the AirPort up from a computer that has wireless built-in and was not dependent on the wireless router. I had been trying from my desktop which had my iTunes but no built-in wireless and the AirPort Utility could never ""see"" the AirPort so I could set it up. Having my desktop connected the the wireless router did not make a difference. Then I installed the software on my laptop which has wireless and my laptop ""saw"" the AirPort as a wireless network when I scanned for additional networks. I connected to it as if it was a network and ran the Utility again from the laptop and there it was. I started to run the setup and it then asked if I want to join an existing network (yeah) and from there it was very straight forward.It works great and now I can listen to songs I gave not played for years."
1,Don't bother,I've been troubleshooting airtunes on this for 3+ years now and have never been able to stop it from constantly cutting out.
1,too difficult to use for just a range extender,"Based on a recommendation from a geek, I bought this to extend the range of the wireless in our house. This one is supposed to be the best. Well, maybe it is, but I couldn't get it to work at all. I am running 32 bit Windows 7. I suspect if you are 100% Apple, it works great. I tried to follow the instructions, but I never saw a green light once. In addition, when you get most of the way through the set up. it messes up your current wireless connection to the point where the only solution I found was to remove the network from my list of preferred networks, and rejoin as a new user, which requires you to re key your security password. Not a big deal, but after the 3rd time, I gave up. I'll take a lesser extender if I can get it to set up. this one is going back."
4,Did the job...and quickly,I was able to use this device almost instantly because the startup instructions actually worked per script. Probably because both products in the link (Airport Express + Itunes) are made from the same company.It does exactly what I intended: stream music wirelessly to my home stereo equipment.
5,It does what is says it will.,There is not much to say other than it does what you expect and it does it very well. The set-up is a breeze. You can stream music from itunes on any computer on the network and use it as a printer hub and WAP. I am very happy with this purchase and would suggest it to anyone who wants to send music from a computer to a home theater or stereo.
3,Welcome to the bleeding edge,"It wasn't easy to set up and, in the end, I couldn't share my printer which was my whole reason for buying Airport Express. The list of supported printers is pretty limited and I didn't check it before buying, so that was my fault.Apple self-service support is weak for Airport Express, but the discussion groups on Apple's website give you a good idea of th problems people are having and the solutions (solved one of my problems at least).My environment was PC-based with a Netgear wireless router and an HP Office Jet. I, like a lot of other PC users, had trouble getting up and running.Apple users and Airport Base Station users seem to have far fewer problems."
3,"Streaming is cool, else get some other unit","If you are interested in the streaming capability, then by all means buy this unit. Otherwise, this and the other Airport products all have one flaw. Unlike just about every other wireless AP/bridge, these things have no web interface. You have to use some crazy tool to configure, and true to Apple, they don't use standard names for things (e.g. instead of saying SSID like everyone else, they say ""name of network"" - you waste a lot of time figuring out what they mean).On the other hand, devices like Linksys wireless stations have web interfaces, and encrypted via HTTPS at that! You can use any browser on any OS, be it Linux/Unix/Windows/Mac/whatever, to configure the station. And they're a heck of a lot easier to configure, at least for someone like me who doesn't want to be coddled with cutesy names for things and to have no options just because Apple doesn't think you need them."
1,james sayer review of air tunes,"This item has been difficult to configure on a windows machine. Although I have downloaded and read two guides the documentation is aimed at Apple users. Because I cannot decide if I have a signal, I will be returning the item soon."
5,iTunes +benefits,"I originally wanted this for Christmas for the sole reason to play iTunes to my stereo in the living room. Once getting this, I soon realized that this device can be used for printing and wireless internet in addition to the iTunes! It comes with WPA encryption also which is a worlds difference in security versus 128-bit WEP encryption. My Linux/Windows XP friend came over and was impressed with the innovation of this product. It's definitely a show-off Mac item that is a powerhouse that is useful and advanced past the cookie-cutter apps and devices for PC machines."
4,Apple Airport Express,"It took a while to configure all 3 of our computers, but now that it is - it works great! Now I see that Apple has just put out an updated Airport Express of which I just bought this one a couple of months ago. Had I known I would've held out a little longer. C'est la Vie"
4,nice device indeed but the mini-optical port will cost you extra,"If you want to hook your airport express to your stereo via optical cable, you can; but you will need to buy a ""mini-optical"" cable or buy a little connector-converter for your regular-size optical cable.You'll need to order a mini-optical cable from amazon or buy one at an Apple store since they are quite hard (impossible really) to find in an electronics store.The airport device itself is great, as other here explain in their reviews. There's no remote and really that is the only deep flaw of the device. You can buy a remote from Keyspan but that will cost you 50bucks more."
2,"Plug and Play? Yea, Right.","I have an Apple Powerbook 17' -- the top of the line Mac notebook. I purchased Airport Express along with it looking for a fully integrated, plug-and-play wireless system. I've had 2 Cisco certified network engineers (both friends), try to help me get connected using this thing. It has become something of a running joke among us at this point. I ended up buying a wireless router designed for Windows and now have sort of a Rube Goldberg configuration that works fairly well. The fault is either with my new $3,000-plus computer, all three of the Airport Express models I've tried, or both. Or me and two newtork professionals. Who knows.This is a great product in theory, but as noted below it is clearly first-generation. Be careful."
2,Mine just died,"Had one of these for about 3 years. During that time I was mostly pleased with it. Generally it would stream my music without problems, although sometimes it would lose the stream intermittently. This was enough of a problem sometimes that I would move the computer to the stereo and bypass the Airport Express altogether.But my biggest complaint is that it died a few days ago. The light will not turn on, can't get it to respond. I'm starting to doubt the staying power of Mac accessories - I would think something like this would last until it's obsolete.I am also not sure why the price is so high now, when I bought mine several years ago it was about 40% cheaper than the price I'm seeing now, with apparently the same functionality.Can't really recommend this product. It would be great if it worked better and lasted longer. As it is, I'd call it overpriced and undermanufactured."
2,aggravating beyond belief to setup,"Once you finally get it working, it does a great job of broadcasting your itunes to your home stereo. But while I can get my linksys router working in less than 15 minutes, it takes hours to get this set up. So much for Apple ease of use"
5,Wireless Freedom for everyone,"A small and convenient unit for wireless freedom all around the house. Excellent signal strength all over, perfect form factor, incredible ease of use (I'm using MAC OSX) and a good price line."
4,Fine product,"This is a very simple product that works as advertised. Easy to set up within MacOS X. I use the AirTunes functionality which is very cool. I don't use the USB printing. While more expensive than other 802.11g routers/access points, the simplicity + AirTunes functionality make it worth the extra money."
2,Won't work with Linksys routers,"I'm sure this is a great product if you have 100% Apple hardware. However, if you have other equipment, such as a Linksys WRT router, and you expect to be able to use the AirPort Express to extend your network (e.g. act as a bridge for a wired computer), you may be disappointed. I found on-line descriptions of how to make this work, and I spend several hours on it but nothing worked. I guess Apple wants to make this such a frustrating experience that users will give up and throw out their Linksys and buy more Apple stuff."
3,Reel Fishing still the king,"most fishing games you'll play, you are limited to bass fishing, and it's either a tournament or arcade experience. This is as close to a real fishing as you'll find. Lots of different lures, rods, lines, fish and environments and wonderful ambient sounds and beautiful graphics. I was disappointed it didn't have as many types of fish and fishing as Reel Fishing 2 (The greatest fishing game ever) but it's the best one out for PS2."
2,Worst Fishing Game I've Played,"Unfortunately I own this game, and I have to say that it is the worst fishing game I own. First off, walking around in the water, or whatever it is the pole(that's right it's just a pole view) is doing, doesn't cut it. Second, the bug sound effects, are as annoying as real bugs. Plus, u can't turn them off, only down so they are just a little annoying instead of horribly annoying.Also, I could care less about catching a freaking Japanese trout, or 3 quarters of the fish featured. Lastly, I fish alot, and it doesn't take you 4 minutes to reel in a 4 inch bluegill. The sooner I get done with this, the sooner I can sell this game and get a better one."
3,true player,i was going to buy this game but im glad that i went to b.b rented it i played it for one hour the true i have sega bass fishing duel. reel fishing dont come close yea the grapic are good that all dont waste your money
5,In the Presence of the Lord,"This is a wonderful CD...very peaceful, soothing and relaxing...great for meditation or just winding down. There is an etherial quality to some of the songs that make it very awe-inspiring and holy. This CD would be great as background music for a prayer service. Organ, harp, piano, bells, and other instrumental sounds create a beautiful collection that truly inspire one to feel ""in the presence of the Lord."""
1,Don't waste your time,"I am a huge beatrice small fan. I love her world of hetar books, but this was one of the worst books i've ever read. And i read alot!The main char. is weak, she whines for her way the entire book and antagonizes her siblings.The climax of the book is all of 4pgs long. I could barely finish this book.Definately find another book to read."
1,Couldn't finish this one.,Very rarely do I ever put a book down that I could not finish. I even tried to read the first sentence of each paragraph to get me through this. Tired ofhearing repeated stories of how Phillipa felt....to many boring details. Kept waitiing for a plot and a hint of one came at 3/4 of the book and thenit was over and I still had 1/4 to read. Very dissappointed.....waste of money.
1,Just terrible,"I'm not going to write a long review, as, I didn't get very far into this book. It's very far and few between that I have to put a book away after starting to read it. Unfortunatley, this was one of those times. I had not read Bertrice Small before, and I won't do so again. This book was just terrible. Terrible plot and terrible characters. But, that's not the worst part..........I wasted my money buying this book. That's the worst part. My advice.......save your money and room on your library card."
2,Too Much Whining!!!!,Because I enjoyed the first two books of this series so much I gave this one a chance as well. Philippa spends a great deal of this book complaining about how awful her life is being a rich hieress and being dumped by a man she hardly knew. The story only pickes up and becomes half interesting when Crispen enters her life. The small sttempt at suspense will be negated if you paid attention in history class. Not one of Ms. Smalls better efforts.
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","This was my first Bertrice Small book and I have to say I was not impressed. I did not care for the character at all. She was spoiled, and self rightous to everyone, including her family. I also thought the book was extremely boring. There was to much descrpition on small mundane things and not enough plot and action. It took me forever to get through this book and I am a very fast reader. This book made me not want to read any of her other books because I am afraid that they will be just as bad. I hope this was a one time oops for Ms. Small because this book was not good at all."
1,Hated this book,"This was my first book by Bertrice Small and it will be my last. The whole book was one repitition after another. If I heard one more time how Philippa was in the favor of the Queen and her mother was friends with both queens I was going to scream. Also very gross and weird names for genitalia. I'm not a prude by any means but ""love channel"" and ""love lance"". No thanks!"
1,Big Time Disappointment,I was pretty excited to read this book. I found Rosamund to be a great read . Until You was somewhat lacking but Phillipa takes the cake. I found it to be boring from page 1. I just couldn't get into it. It was also very drawn out. Ms. Small's earlier books had more steam to them. I don't think this is true about her later books. Hopefully the 4th one in the series will be much better.
3,ENJOYABLE SERIES FOR ME,"Well, this is the third in the series from Bertrice Small and I have enjoyed reading all of them so far. I certainly don't agree with some of the poor reviews it has gotten. I would give the story a 3 1/2 stars if possible. It is not the best of her writing but not the worst either. I love this time period and I enjoy the strong herions like Rosamund the mother that started this series. I would recommend these books if you like Bertrice Small. She is easy to read, good characters, and she is always stimulating. I just started the last of the series and the first few pages are promising."
3,"bertrice,how could yoou?","I own and have read( more than once )all of ms. small's books.. have loved them all until this series. Rosamund was great, but I could have done without so much Patrick and LOTS move of Logan in Until You. Philippa was a true disappointment. ms. small can and has done so much better all these years. Banon would be int eresting, and I am waiting for the new heiress, Bessie and William's story. at any rate, next year there will be the next.I think. To digress, Skye was always rated tops, but I think Jasmine is equal. just my opinion. Thomas was the true star of this one. deep south reader"
3,A little Boring!,"It wasnt what I expected! The so called plot was mediocre and short.. I by far liked ""Rosamund"" and ""Until You"" so much better!!! Cant wait for ""The Last Heiress"" to come out!!!!!"
4,Daughter Got an A,My Daughter (6th Grade) used one of the experiments here as the basis of her project (and added her own twists)
3,where is vol 3?,"I have vol 1, but until vol 3 comes out, not interested in this to have 2/3 of the series."
1,volume 1 is way better,"I think disney picked the best episodes and put them on' volume 1. volume 2 contains an extremely long and boring pilot (disc 1) and several episodes that I would consider to be ""filler"" episodes. on the bright side, amazon did a great job in fullfilling and delivering the order. hope this helps.--ben and his rescue ranger fan son"
5,"Come on Disney, Release Volume Three!","Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers was one of my favorite cartoon series from when I was a kid. I have enjoyed watching volumes 1 and 2, but Disney is lazy about releasing the third volume.The episodes on Volume Two are:Disc 1Rescue Rangers to the Rescue Part OneRescue Rangers to the Rescue Part TwoRescue Rangers to the Rescue Part ThreeRescue Rangers to the Rescue Part FourRescue Rangers to the Rescue Part FiveA Creep In the DeepNormie's Science ProjectSeer No EvilDisc 2Chipwrecked ShipmunksWhen Mice Were MenChocolate ChipsThe Last LeprechanWeather Or NotOne Upsman-ChipShell ShockedLove Is A Many Splintered ThingDisc 3Song of the Night'n'DaleDouble 'O' ChipmunksGadget Goes HawaiianIt's A Bird, It's Insane, It's Dale!Short Order CrooksMind Your Cheese and QsOut of Scale .Dirty Rotten Diapers"
5,Great,"While for one reason or another these episodes depict the earlier period of characters' life, they do preserve a unique atmosphere of the series, and are certainly well worth to bee seen."
5,Chi-Chi-Chi Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers,"By far my 5 year old's favorite show (for this month). I'm more 'old school' Chip and Dale. But hey, it's all good."
5,Memories....I love this show!!,"Oh the memories I have of this show. I loved this as a child and as I watch the episodes, I realize that I still love this show. All my friends keep wanting to come over to watch this with me (I think I am being a little selfish). Can't wait until Volume 3 comes out!!Product arrived with-in the time it said it would. And I received text updates up until it reached my door! Sign up for text alerts, it's great! Love it!"
5,interesting and unusual,"The hero of the story gets shot dead by Nazis- but instead of going immediately into some sort of afterlife, he wanders around Poland- first, his house and neighborhood, then the adjoining countryside. Eventually, he discovers that other murdered Jews from his town, including most of his family, are also in this in-between state. The town's Jews then wander around until they find someplace that they think is Paradise. But then the book gets even stranger (without giving away the ending!). I generally found this book to be entertaining and a quick read; your tastes may of course vary."
4,"Enchanting, if a little heavyhanded.","This was a great story with beautifully woven magical elements. The sense of surrealism is incredibly present throughout. The main character, Chaim, is somewhat of an aggravating character, and I couldn't fathom why he would really be a protagonist - though, in the context of the book, I could see how he is supposed to be more of an ""everyman"". One thing that really irked me was the relationship he had with the Polish girl. It came out of nowhere and seemed to get nowhere fast before it withered into nothing and was never mentioned again. I could understand the symbolism, but it seemed a little empty, in the end. Overall, it was a very good story with a few flaws, but what book doesn't?"
1,Let me be honest with you.,"Let me be completely honest with you.This was a TERRIBLE book. I think that the author doesn't even understand the holocaust, and what it did to people's minds.In fact, Here's the summary. A guy called Chaim dies. His Rabbi is a crow now. Chaim and Rabbi go to the rest of the jews who were killed. WHEEE.Oh no! Where's the world to come?Hey, look, it's jesus!LUXURY HOTEL FOR THE JEWS YAYTHE MOON IS GONE! WE MUST FIND IT!Nothing makes the slightest bit of sense. The author, additionally, has the attention span of a squirrel. No consistent PROBLEM. Just... ""I'M CHAIM I'M DEAD OH NO STUFF HAPPENS THE END""These characters have less character development than a piece of cardboard.Little plot consistency... bad characters... boring in general...This was a terrible book.Do not buy."
2,Wait for the movie.,"Blessing on the Moon took me only 3 hours to read. I got the impression I was reading a play that had been converted to a novella. The characters are two-dimensional, the dialog stiff and the setting vague. The book should be made into a screenplay--that way we could see what the author has failed to describe. An important message but the wrong medium."
2,Boring-not her best,"I've read Elaine's other series which I liked,. but found this one disappointing. I heard this series was funny, it's not to me. Helen is a bore. Or maybe this is the South Florida pomposity coming out which is funny to them.I note the front cover quote from Nancy Martin, who is published by the same house. Hardly objective! We readers are being taken for a ride by the publishers' authors endorsements."
3,I must be in a slump with Elaine Viets books....,"I loved how this series started, but I had to force myself to finish this book. I hate to see this happen, I figure it's me not the author, so I will take a break from her. I recommend you start at the beginning of this series, secondary characters are wonderful as are all the job situtations that come up."
5,****A Definite Keeper*****,What a wonderful story of courage. I finished this story on the 10th Anniversary of 9/11 and I could not help but draw parallels from the book and our various feelings during that fateful day a decade ago and how it takes great courage to turn the other cheek and forgive.
5,Brilliant Introduction to Handelian Opera,I saw this on a U.S. broadcast of an English television production and rushed to buy the DVD when it became available. This is a brilliant introduction to Handel and his operatic music. All the artists are first rate. The camera work is an artistic triumph. This is one of the best DVDs of classical music you will ever see. It is one of the high points of contemporary postmodern art.
1,Ridiculous,"This book is not hardly sufficient to pass this test. The SNA section alone is 10-15% of the test, and this book covers nothing that you need on that topic. The ATM and OSPF sections are also sparse. Go with the Cisco Press book if you want to pass. I'm not sure why Lammle's name is even on this book. It seems as if all he wrote was the introduction."
2,FAIL the test with this; try the Bruno CCIE book!,"I bot this and found it difficult to get myself to read thru it.So, I loaned it to a CCNP (v2) cert. friend, who read it throughly. He FAILED the ccdp exam, much to his surprize! Today, we were looking at the new Cisco Press CCIE written book, and my friend noticed the answers to the CCDP exam questions are well covered in that book (by Bruno). So, I'll try that one."
3,Not structured enough...,"I think this book is a bit messed up. It contains most topics in the exam, such as Stratacom, SNA. The problem is that all information is written in unstructured, messed up paragraphs throughout the book.CID is the first test I ever have failed (I prepared with this book only). Now I wait for the Cisco-book which I intend to read before the next tryout..."
2,Not enough,"I read this book and the Cisco Press CID to pass the exam. The passing score on the test is now 75%, and at this point neither book on its own covers enough to pass the test."
3,Need other material also,Poor coverage of SNA and X.25. Also read the Cisco Press CID along side this book.
3,A good book to use with the Cisco course notes,"I purchased this text as a study preparation guide for the CID exam. The book covers some good material on network design and explains some useful design concepts and methodologies which I tend to use in my everyday work. Despite the fact that it does cover some nice extras like DSL and router commands, these are not examinable in the CID exam. I found the SNA section a little thin and was referring back to the course notes for addtional information on this topic. A nice (light) chapter on security makes interesting reading. A good reference text, but use with the course notes if you're preparing for the exam."
1,"Mozart Opera Lover from Falls Church, VA","I was extremely disappointed when I heard this opera as the sound was horrible and I have a 32 inch SONY Trinton TV and a SONY DVD!!! The sound gets worse after the overture when you hear the singers because it sounds so far away and distant. I bought this version because of the raving reviews I found here. I think the production was poor and the singers were not all that great especially Cherubino. Even though Finley and Fleming make a wonderful pair together, I've heard them sing Mozart far better than in this production. Hagley as Susanna in the JEG/Paris recording is delightful through and through compared to this one. Also, the tempi was very slow as well as the singing--there's so much going on at the same time in the opera, it should move more quickly!! I find the version with JEG conducting and Byrn Terfel singing far more superior!!! DO NOT BUY! You will be very disappointed."
1,Achieves the impossible,"You would think it would be impossible to make Mozart look and sound cheap and boring. From the start you get the feeling of emptiness and general lack of ideas. The settings and costumes are uninspired and just plain cheap. The tempo of the orchestra is slow and sounds tired. The voices are good but the ensembles just don't sound right. The Count sounds good but looks more like a country boor than an aristocrat, Susanna looks way too modern and I believe that this must be one of the least attractive Cherubinos on record. I was not able to finish watching the DVD."
2,not greatest,"This performance of Figaro was musically superb, however the stage being slanted bothered some action. There were unfortunately no stage sets to speak of at all, or meager, nor varied costumes. Fleming was somewhat plump, but gorgeous just the same."
1,"I would've given it a 0 stars, if I could","Please do not waste your money on this one. The sound is tourchuring. We could not even listen through the first act! It was complete waste of money for us! Poor Mozart, and I always thought that you can't go wrong with Mozart's pieces, what a dissapointment."
4,"Four roses, one thorn","Must the role of Cherubino ALWAYS be sung by a woman? I ask in ignorance: Why must this be so? I found this character impossible to accept, and for me the woman who sang the role ruined every scene she was in. I could only see a woman dressed as a man and pretending to be a man, and a willing suspension of disbelief simply would not set in."
3,Così fan .... molti,"La qualità sonora è proprio mediocre. A questo si aggiunge una dizione veramente scadente, difficile da tollerare in una recita avvenuta nella Nazione del teatro ed in un tempio dell'Opera quale Glyndebourne. Perfino i recitativi risultano talvolta incomprensibili, quantomeno quelli delle parti minori, ammesso e non concesso che in questa opera qualcosa possa essere considerata minore. Viceversa sappiamo quanto nella trilogia di Da Ponte i recitativi costituiscano il telaio portante dell'opera, in grado non solo di sorreggere ma anche di fare ulteriormente lievitare in alto una musica letteralmente baciata dal cielo.Paradossalmente consiglierei l'editore di aggiungere quantomeno i sottotitoli in italiano (sigh!)."
2,Bad Sound Quality,"I was thinking of buying this DVD but was able to borrow a copy from the library this week to test it out first. I was disappointed with the sound. Most of the time, the orchestra overwhelmed the soloists. This performance was originally broadcast in 1994 on English televison and was made for the old style TVs (4:3). This DVD did not do justice to Gerald Finley's wonderful voice. I also found the sets too modern looking and skimpy."
3,Sound quality a dissapointment,"I fell in love with the characters when I watched R.M. Arts, The Netherlands Opera, Il Barbiere Di Siviglia.When I compare the sound quality of that DVD to this one, this one is a disappointment. Listening to the Orchestra, I enjoyed the overture a great deal, but then when the singers start their performance they sound far away. I have read other reviewers reservations about Kultur's sound quality and have to add my voice to that chorus.I am an opera beginner, but as we are unable to travel to see opera, videos and dvds are my only chance to view these performances. I will have to think twice about investing in a Kultur presentation, especially since these programs cost more than popular movies"
2,For what its worth,"I purchased this DVD with some trepidation given the disparity of opinions among the reviewers. I was disappointed. I would characterize this as an unoffensive but completely uninspired production. I have no beef with the quality of the singing, but the staging, acting, and direction show a mimimum of effort, imagination or emotion. This is a humorless, lifeless production of Figaro. Scenes that have moved me to tears or to guffaws in other productions were rushed through or dismissed as though they weren't worth bothering with in this production. I am by no means an audiophile, but even I was bothered by the poor quality of the sound. Singers literally cannot be heard when they stand at certain areas of the stage (a glaring problem in the ensemble pieces). I'm continuing my search for a great production of Figaro on VHS/DVD. Any suggestions?"
4,Part of a Set,"The movie's OK. I just wanted to make people aware that this movie is part of the Busby Berkly Volume 2 collection. I didn't realize I already had the movie in that collection, so now I have two. I'll be more careful and not think that just because there's no yellow bar on top of the page saying you've bought the movie... you may have it in another set. But it's a good movie... I like Dick Powell and the price is good."
3,Better than typing with your controller...,"Well, if you have a computer with internet capabilities, there is no sense in using your Dreamcast to surf the net. The keyboard's only purpose is to make typing easier, which is only good for messageboards or sending emails....And most of the function keys don't really do anything useful. A time saver to a certain extent..."
3,Keyboard needs Upgrade,"I love the keyboard compared with the E-keyboard. hopefully with the new browser, they made some of the keys programable, ie: F1-F12, S1-S3 user assignable keys (such as Fav URL's). Let it be at the users discretion. Also they could allow the Alt key able to access more functions. Well Lets hope that as this progresses, they can use alot more of the inginuity that we all know they have."
4,dc surfing cool whit the keyboard,it's fast and fun cool for chating (online and online games) but it will be much faster whit the mouse it's the only things missing (surfing whit the mouse)like a pc
4,"Not exactly complete, but a great reference regardless","This book is a terrific companion for web developers, whether beginning or experienced. I've worked with HTML for years, but there are always slightly more obscure tags that you just can't quite remember how to use, or the exact name of the tag. This is how this book comes in handy.In my opinion, it's not really all that complete in depth, but it is rather complete in breadth. By that I mean to say that if you need a tutorial, you may want other more in depth materials on the topic you're learning, such as cascading style sheets. But once you've done something once, and you just need a refresher, this book is a handy reference guide."
4,A couple of more chapters were needed,"A great read! However, the ""pardon"" from Sunny was too easy, Chance deserved a good sweat, duty is fine, but she did not deserve the way he used her. The last two chapters were wonderful, the meeting between Wolf and Chance made me teary. Well handled. Met Ms. Howard at a book signing in Borders in New York, she says the McKenzies are done, but please Nick deserves at least a Christmas Novelette. And, Margretta, Sunny's sister, poor woman, a suffering shadow, also deserves a book, after all she is not a McKenzie and it will be chance, pardon the pun to make her happy."
4,A Game of Chance,It was a good story line and I enjoyed it. Love Linda Howard books but even though it was good not her best work.
2,a slap in the face,"To be honest, I felt like I was slapped in the face by Ms. Howard's introduction. I understand she doesn't want to kill off Wolf and Mary, but did she have to be so rude? I felt that she was saying ""Fine, here's Chance's story, now get off my back"" After reading the other books which I might add were much longer then this story, I was eagerly awaiting Chance's story. I hope she does a story about Sunny's sister as well, and she doesn't have to kill off Wolf and Mary to have Nick's story done. Last I heard, people were living a very healthy life in their 80's."
3,a game of chance,"Not bad for an average Linda Howard book, but certainly not her best, nor a closure for the Mackenzie family. Story line same as joe's, maris, and zane. Could not wait to get, and actually put it down for a day or two, something i rarely ever do with Linda Howard's books."
4,"Chance, not what I expected","You can read the story synopsis by other reviewers. For me, the story was good, but not the greatest of LH's books. A satisfying read though.Good character development and a solid story. Good romance and fireworks between the characters. And Chance is a great alpha male.My only (teeny-tiny) quibbles with this book are thata. Chance needed to grovel a LOT more for what he did to Sunny (he almost got her killed, fer crying out loud!)b. Erm, while I know it was important to the storyline, I had a hard time believing that she was able to keep the baby after that much extensive surgery and blood loss (OK, so I know too much).c. Lastly, I don't care WHY the man lies to you, if you find out, you give him heck...I don't care if he saved the universe from the Pod People. So Sunny 'accepting' what he had done just didn't ring true--- either that or she's a major doormat.Otherwise, a great read and I highly recommend it!"
5,"hot, hot, hot",I have read every book by linda howard and i can say that the family mackenzie is one of the best things to every happen to romance writing. every story is individual and complete. they also keep you informed about some of your favorite people.i waited patiently for chance and i was not disappointed when he finally materialized. thanks ms. howard you just keep adding to my book collection.
2,What happened?,"I love all of Linda Howard's books, except this one. The ""HERO"" uses Sunny, puts her life in danger and then excpects her to forgive him,(which of course she does). All he does is lie, NO THANKS! But, every other one of Linda Howard's books are steamy and full of TRUE love, try her other books. You won't be disapointed!"
2,Dissapointed almost bored!!,"I love Linda Howard's books but i was not thrilled with this one. I thought the ending wasn't emotional enough, none of it was emotional enough and Sunny let Chance off way to easily.He risked her life and used her even after he knew she was innocent and it didn't even seem to faze him at all. I really didn't like the character ""Chance"" i thought he was kind of a coldhearted jerk and if a man ever used me that way i would never have married him so easily...Definitly not one of her better books!!"
5,Another MacKenzie Bites the Dust!,"I, like others, did not like the fact that Chance lied and used Sunny. Especially when she most likely would have helped him if he had only told her what he was up to. Even though I don't like what Chance did, I still love the MacKenzie family. I REALLY hope that Ms. Howard continues writing about this wonderful family. She's got me wondering what the next generation will be like and what they will end up doing with their lives. *I have to read Mike and Josh's stories, please make reprints soon! I feel like I'm missing important pieces to a puzzle."
5,Chance and Sunny finally get it together.,I loved Chance and Sunny and what they went through to finally get it together. It was an interesting story.
4,Linda Howard Fan,"This was a quick and fun read. Loved the ending. The family strength and committment example was absolutely heartwarming. Just when something a family member is doing to ""bug"" me, it was a great nudge to help me not sweat the small stuff."
5,"WOW, Best in series","Ok I felt the need to write a review bc although many liked the book lots of ppl were harsh on it bc of how chance used sonia in order to capture her father. While I loved all of the Mackenzie men, and their partners, I actually thought that the relationship in this one of the series was the best and most believable. Its not that in the other books the characters werent great, and you could see why they loved eachother, but I always felt with each of them that the connection was a little forced and a little random. But Linda Howard got it right with this one. You really see how the characters interactions and personalities complement eachother and lead up to a real relationship. If chance was a jerk in continuing to lie to sonia, it was only bc he hadnt reached a point where he saw a way out. Although i think she may have forgiven him a little bit too fast, you cant help but like them both together. This was a real winner!!"
3,At last At last,"The eagerly awaited ""chance"" story. Although not in the same league as the other MACKENZIE series it was still a good read. The relationship between chance and sunny could have been a bit more explored and i found myself wishing for more pages. PLEASE PLEASE do a story on Nick."
3,There are better Mackenzie books out there,"I was so looking forward to Linda Howard's A Game Of Chance. I loved Mackenzie's Mission. It is one of my all time favorite books! A Game of Chance was okay, but not on the same level as other Mackenzie stories. First off, I did not like how the hero (Chance) told one lie after another to the heroine yet did not think anything about sleeping with her while he was doing this. That irked me and turned me off for the first part of the story. I felt like the second half was much better. I also liked how we got to catch up with the other Mackenzie family members at the end. I am glad tough that Chance finally got his turn to have a story. I kinda hope that Mrs. Howard will go on and right more Mackenzie stories using the grandchildren as the central characters especially the only girl grandchild. That would be one I would like to read."
3,"Sweet, Sexy, Slow","As part of the Mackenzie series, this is a good addition. But, as a stand-alone romance, not so good. The family get togethers at the beginning and end of the book, were a bit schamlzy for me. And while the love scenes were hot, they were also too long and descriptive. Chance as a hero is very alpha. I can deal with that in romance. But I wish there had been more of a story to go with the romance. A little slow for me."
5,Amazing ending to the series!,I enjoy this book so much and sad at the same time because I'm going to missed the Mackenzie family. Great characters and ordinary people circumstances. I laughed and cried with the life of the Mackenzie. Well done Ms. Howard for this wonderful series!!!
3,My dogs love it,"I use these food rolls diced into small pieces for agility training treats, and the dogs view them as very high value treats, so they must really love the taste. They will always go racing for the target jar that has them. I only wish they manufacturer would drop the sugars from the product, I don't really like that."
5,my life in dog years,"This is the best book ever. Gary Paulsen explains his life and how much he loves dogs, also he tells how many tears and how much laughter they went though. I highly request you read this book, it is great and was always interesting."
3,My life in dog Years,This is a good book for people who like dog. I think that it is good that Gary Paulsen spent most of his time with creatures he liked to be around. One thing I did not like is that every time he would get real close to a dog it would either die or it would find a new home. Almost every dog that he has had has saved his life some how. Every time he would lose a dog there would always be another dog that he would find and he would take the dog and they would go do everytinhg together. This is a good book and I would recommed this book to any one that loves dogs.
2,Great book for young audience,"Gary Paulsen's,My Life in Dog Years, is about all the Dogs owned in his life. Gary owned the dogs since he was a toddler to a fully grown adult.One of the dogs Gary owned was a Great Dane called Caesar,he was gentle and gigantic.As you'll read this you will understand why these dogs became so special to him in many ways.This book also has funny moments like when Dirk,the tiny watchdog,Gary owned when he was a child bit someone's pants off because Gary was being bullied.Emotional moments are also very common in this book like when some dogs Gary found were missing,abandon,and lost.Reading this book will be easy for the young ones because they will understand how Gary feels about his dogs.An Audience older than 14 wouldn't be as interested.Overall this book has some short stories, were a reader can't get lost.I would recommend this book for an audience under 14."
4,A great book!,"My Life in Dog Years, written by Gary Paulsen was one of the funniest books I've read in a long time. Gary Paulsen has an extremely different way of writing from other authors. I have read a couple of his other books. This was probably not his best, but it was well written. I would highly recommend it for any dog lover."
2,Response to A reader,"In his review below, A reader suggests we overlook the ""small errors"" in this book ""in the interest of the greater whole.""First, if an error of 50 MILLION percent is small, I'm curious to know what he would consider a significant error.Second, I challenge his notion that it is in the interest of the greater good to ignore these errors. It is my understanding that the primary purpose of science is to dismantle misconceptions, not to dispense them... too better our understanding of the world not to worsen it. If we value science, we must value the social necessity of challenging what is presented as scientific fact. We must shine a light on these errors as errors, not turn a blind eye to them. (By the way, no one has challenged the accuracy of my initial review below.)Personnally, I feel the value of this book can only be enhanced by correcting these errors and eagerly await the next edition."
4,great read,"A really nice book by the master of 20th century writing James Michener, any fan o his will love this poignant tale."
1,Waste of Money,The watches arrived on time. But they don't work I can imagine one not working but all the 3watches are not working.
5,An Extraordinarily Valuable Book,"The value of this book cannot be overstated. It shocks and invigorates the reader, drawing out his or her psychological 'hot points'-the blocks that prevent understanding. But the value goes beyond this: it gets to the heart of the matter, emphasizing what it is that is really important in reading, studying, learning, and understanding. The words in the text may be few, but they pack quite a punch. This book is one that teaches not only by what is written in it but by what it does to the reader. Or, to put it differently, the blank spaces in the book are as useful as those darkened by the print in it. Those who wonder how this may be possible are encouraged and invited to explore this truly wonderful work by Idries Shah."
1,waste of money!,"Who wouldn't think this movie would be awesome....?! That's what I was thinking when I ordered it atleast, wrong! This was the biggest waste of money, you couldn't hear the fighting scenes, or anything for that matter since the background music was playing loudly. also it was terrible quality."
5,The best game in the History of Games!,"So far this is my third harvest moon game I've played and by far it is the best! Once you start playing, you're hooked and you can't stop until you've beaten the game. The game is much more realistic then the other versions such as the weather effects. I cannot believe how advanced Natsume has become and I cannot wait until the next one they come up with. So far I am married to Celia and have 2 cows and a sheep...people I know laugh at me because i play this game since it has no violence since that is what has become ""in"" now awadays. Parents, if you have to get ur children off Halo or GTA or whatever, get them this game and I guarantee you it will hook them on to a fun, realistic, non-violent game. Just try it and you won't be mad with the results."
4,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!,If i were to describe this game in one word i would say that it is.... Omg i cant describe it in one word! its just to amazing!! i hope that they keep on continueing to make more of the harvest moon series!!i love it and can't get eough but anyway enough about that. Anyway its just so addicting! i can't get enough !!! It is even better then alkl the other Harvest Moon's (not that the others r bad its just that this one is a little better) I LOVE IT!!!!
5,Good virtual game,"This game is fun for all ages. It is simalar to animal crossing but more realistic and on a farm. But if u like animal crossing u will like this. The water and the grass is the most realistic part of the game. Its like basic farm life, start with a farm in a small town,get a wife and kid,grow crops and raise animals,and it goes on forever. It is hard to get a wife,there r three people u can marry and each one is either eaisy medium or hard to get. They each have a diary and it says how much they like u. U can buy animals and all sorts of things. U can also plant crops. Even though every second is a miniute on the game that is why the seasons go by fast. If they dont go by fast it would take forever to go by real time and have four seasons. There r four seasons in the game but most kids dont enough patience to wait that long. Anyways this is a very fun game."
5,THE BEST GAME,"If you liked Animal Crossing you will love this game. You can marry, have animals (dogs, cows, chickens etc.), catch fish, pick fungi and plants, grow crops and more. You are probably saying, ""Who'd wanna play a game about a harvesting??"". Well this game is certainly not just about that. I garauntee you, you will get hooked."
4,and the franchise stays alive,"I was a little skeptical on how the new HM could live up to the past ones let alone expound on it, but it miraculously did. There are only three wives to choose from but that's my ONLY complaint. All the minor annoyances of the old games have been fixed, but there are new challenges like keeping yourself fed, raising your kid, and choosing your friends that influence your little bundle of joy. It focuses more on everyday life and makes farming a little easier in that you dont have to do monotonus chores like water an entire field of tomatoes EVERY day. It's a great buy, especially if you're a fan of the series, but it's also a good game to start off with"
5,Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Game!,"If Animal Crossing was good, this is great!It's so nice to find a game that's human-scaled, cute and friendly. And the game arc goes on for virtual years. Compared to a Star Wars game, this is a MUCH greater value.Water your crops, feed and brush your animals. Find a wife. Raise a child. Grow prize melons, create new hybrids.This is such a unique game that you've really got to try it out for yourself. My kids (5 and 9) love the game. Some reading ability is necessary to play the game."
4,my own experience,"Well, Harvest Moon AWL is a wonderful game. Let me tell you what you can do: you buy sheep, horse, goat, cows(4 types), and chickens. Also, you will get ducks, a mouse, a lizard, a cat, a racoon, an owl, and that's about it.(these last ones are pets, along with your dog) you milk the cows, you shave the sheep, you milk the goat, you ride the horse, and you pick up eggs from ducks and chickens. Then comes seeds...You can plant and harvest several varieties of seeds, or you can make fabulous recipes to share with your friends of Forget-me-not-Valley or with your wife and son. To get a wife, you must talk to her and take things that she likes to her. When you get married, you get a baby son, which grows into a boy, then a teenager, and finnally an adult that ends up being married with either Kate, or Lumina (2 girls from the game). Your son can also choose a career. And other activities include: 3 mini-games,fishing, horse back riding, excavations, making hibrids, and making friends."
3,Good?,"I got this Harvest Moon game, and I must say, it's pretty good. At first it seems you could play it forever... And so you play day after day after day...And then it's boring. Yeah, it's fun, but it's so monogonous. Being a Harvest Moon fanatic, i of course had to beat the game with every girl. I only ended up finishing one, and it was a struggle. There are no festivals, no fun, just work day after day. It's definitely a fun game, but unlike some of the others, you can't play it forever. It just gets dull.If you liked the other versions of Harvest Moon, then buy it. It's a great addition to the collection. If your a new Harvest Moon fan, you might be better starting with Back to Nature."
4,Looks like fun,I just bought this from amazon and i had it be the one day shipping. It should arive tomorrow and tomorrow i will get to play it. This game looks like a really fun game. I enjoy playing the sims and this looks like it will be just as fun. So anyways this looks like a great game and it looks like it will be a lot of fun.
4,Harvest Moon Rules,Harvest Moon is the best thing that ever happened to Game Cube. I was so exceited when I found out that it was coming to Game Cube. I love the game. It reaches new levels that the other games never got to. I love it. I think I was addicted to the game even before I bought it!
3,Fun!,"I loved this game when I got it forever ago.If you want money fast, plant as many banana trees as you can and buy a seed maker. Sell the seeds for over 400 a pop. I learned that on my own early on.***This may be for Another Wonderful Life***If you want a really nice playing experience, where things aren't as hard to do, or once you get really far and you don't have Mineral Town to get the extra things, there is a cheat you can use! Just hook up another controller (in slot 4 I believe) and keep hitting the Start button. It gives you full amounts of all the random items in the game (annoying when you have x99 sickles...) I used it to get the new music."
3,not like other Harvest Moons....,"I'm a fan of the series, but I had never really bought a Harvest Moon game, only rented. But when I decided to buy, tough luck, I buyed the wrong one. Its boring, growing crops and caring for animals is pointless. You don't really need ANY money at all to survive, you can't upgrade you home, no festivals. It the very worst.The only two good things about this game are the graphics, and your baby. Your baby can become a lot of things. It grows up to be a man, and can choose quite a lot of careers, and you can influence him on that. The problem is that it takes ALOT of time (30 Years), and you only need about a minute a day to influence him, the rest is TOTAL BOREDOM.I found myselft waking up, taking to my kid, and sleeping back in until next day and so on.Its a very bad Harvest Moon, if you like Harvest Moon games, buy another Harvest Moon not this. If you don't like Harvest Moon games, you're going to like it less with this game."
5,BUY.IT.NOW.,"This game is truly the most supprisingly addictive game ever. This being my first experience with this series of games, I can't compare it to previous versions, but I can still say it is definitely worth it. My parents make fun of me because I'm obsessed with this farming RPG but won't do chores in our garden much.You immediately forget you are doing chores on a video game and just, have fun doing these things so boring in real life!! It is very realistic, and grabs you and won't let go.Just give it a chance if you've never played a HM game before. If you are a fan of other versions, I can't compare it, but I can say it's very good."
4,great!,"It's a great game but the walkthrough is really long. You start out with only a cow and a dog but later you get more animals. Over all, you should at least rent the game."
4,Harvest Moon+you=fun!!!,"I'm new to harvest moon...but I'm already in love with it!!! I'v also heard of a girls verson comeing![A.k.a.,your a girl insted of a boy]If you like RPG[role playing game] then you'll love H.M.! I also made a pros and cons list: Pro:lots of time[thrity years in game time!] Pro:Fun to play! Pro: GBA hook-up adds gameplay! Con:Have to buy it[Its soooo good,it should be free for all to enjoy] :Anyway,you should run out and buy this peice of art in game form,so what are you waiting for? Go get this game!!!"
4,GrEaT gAmE,"Hey...I am only on year one and I just got into summer, I just purposed to Celia and she accepted! So I will soon get married....i have a sheep, 2 chickens (male and female) a cow, a horse and a dog. I want to know how to get my cow pregnant...and I don't have gameboy so I can't link it to go into town...what do I do??"
4,koollllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,great game rented it. slow at start gets really fun. u can have marriges children a type of beer. its kinda like animal crossing but better more things to do than wait around a day for new stuff at tom nooks place. animal crossings phhhh... yeah right.
5,This game Rox!,"There is sooo much to do! You could be an animal caretaker, a farmer, or both! You get married to 1 of 3 girls,(If you don't attempt to build a relationship one will propose to YOU during the first year.) and have aa son. He starts as a toddler, grows into a child, then a teen, then turns into an adult. Your son gets a job based on how you influence him as a child, and(this sorta stinks) over time you ""age""(get gray hair) It also has fantastic graphics and, um...suprising suprises!"
5,WOW,"Hey, im 12, and my name is. uh. nvm... my i reccomend this game to EVERYONE if you enjoy games like the simes, exept with much less, and i dont think, any, sexual themes, it is a GREAT game, and i HIGHLY reccomend it. =p"
1,I'm Impressed!,"I have read at least 10 reviews on this game, and watched about 5 movie clips, seen about 50 screenshots, and i can safely say, I WANT THIS GAME! 40$ sounds like a good offer on this game! I might be able to buy it soon, and i can hardly wait!"
2,Worst Game EVER!,"After reading these reviews I thought it was a good game, but when I checked it out in the stores I burst out laughing. By the ratings on the back it sounds raelly bad, but I've never played it before so how could I know what it's like. I never want to get this game and you shouldn't too."
1,???,"(ignore the 1 star rating, i had to put something to post here, this post is a question really!)Firstly...Should i get this game?All my friends at school have it and say its great but im not sure.I LOVED animal crossing for the first 2 months or so but the graphics put me off after that.so guys...SHOULD I GET THIS GAME???cyaMichaelps. PLEASE REPLY TO ME BY EMAIL FOR THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION!!"
4,Harvest Moon Lover,"I bought this so I would have something to do when I got my wisdom teeth out.I really love Harvest Moon, I wish though that this version had more festivals. Otherwise I love it!"
1,this game sucks,"I hate this game! It is soooooooo booooring. It is also for rednecks. It is so stupid. If you are looking for a fun game with violence and action, dont get this game."
4,This is one great game,This is a game that just absorbs your attention for hours of exciting gameplay. Who knew farming could so much fun?
5,A nice innocent game,This game has good morals and sweet characters. It would be good for the younger group with adult assistance.Good points about the game:More animals to choose fromNice graphicsGreat storylineMore choices on how you want to live your lifeBad points:Animals can die and get sick (big dissapointment for younger children)Hard to earn moneyNot all chicken eggs are fertileDays pass too slowly
5,This Game is The Best,When I first Played this game i didn't know what to expect put when I got married I started to understand the game a litte bit more but I only rented it but I'm going to buy it as soon as I can. This is the Best video game in the world I don't know how you made it but I wish I could make A better game then this one but I can't because this game is the greatest video game on the face of the Earth! :):):):)
5,Havest Moon Rockz!!!,"I am soooo looking forward to getting this game! I have Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland, and it's great! This one sounds awesome! Saving the town was cool, but having relationships and stuff will be even cooler. I'm going to buy it today! (YAY!) I hope you buy it, too. You'll have endless hours of fun! Hope this helps! ;)"
2,Not a great way to spend your money and time!,"This game is very boring. The object of it is to, well, get married and have kids. What you do in a 'day' is you try to run to town, pick some flowers, and give them to the girls (Muffy, Celcia and Naomi) A day is about 10 minutes, and every one is asleep as soon as the sun goes down. Also, you have to manage a farm, with little or no money. If this is a ""wonderful life"" I don't want to know what a terrible life is!!Pros:The best graphics in a video game i've ever seen!Cute charactersAdorable AnimalsCons:Not a very good story lineYou can only be a boy (NOT fun for us girls)You start out with no money, and it is VERY hard to get your hands on someIt is BORING!!!I highly reccomend you spend your money on somthing else. This game is horrible. I only rated it a 2 overall because of the graphpics!--Star"
5,A great game,"I beleive in the saying that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. I'm not here to say how the music is or anything, I'm here to reccomend this game because it is great and teaches children like myself how to maintain a family and a farm, and also helps social skills. Even if some small peices of this game are not satisfactory, the entire game is great and one of the best I've yet played. Thank you for reading this review and I hope you buy this game."
5,Farming life for the couch potato...,"This is why everyone should own a GameCube!Harvest Moon A Wonderful Life (HMAWL or HMWL) has surpassed all previous Harvest Moon games. The main idea for HMAWL is to make your farm successful. Sounds simple enough, milk a cow or two, collect an egg, plant a tomato plant and give it a little water. Well that's farther from the truth.You wake up at 6 AM to milk your cow(s) and feed all your livestock (chickens, cows, horses, and so on), around 8 AM you are watering your field of tomatoes, which if your lucky will only take an an hour!There are hundreds of things to do in one day (plant crops, buy and sell stuff, take care of your animals, fish, cook, talk to townsfolk, get married and have a kid... well not in one day), unfortunately you need to choose which tasks you need to do and tasks you want to do.Great gameplay, awesome graphics, superb sound and tons of fun!!Living on a farm couldn't be more fun!"
5,Really fun game,"This game is really fun and really addictive. Raise crops and animals. Marry and raise child. Mine, fish, and gain friends. You play as a male in this game. The animals you can raise are cows, chicken, ducks, horse, sheep, and a goat. You can only have a son. Your house upgrades when you finish one year. There are four seasons and you can only grow certain crops in certain seasons. I hope I helped!"
3,"I wouldn't call it the best book, but it is not the worst","I think the title conveys my feelings on this book. I didn't particularly think it was the best book I have ever read, but it was not the worst. I thought the book was good, but that it just dragged on and on. I am not sure if it was the writing or what...... It is o.k.,if you have a lot of time to spend reading, but not for a quick read. It is emotional, but not overly so."
2,I love the Film but HATE the DVD,"The Film is great but what a disaster, watching this DVD!I usually do not complain but this time I will send a letter to all involved with the making or distributing this DVD. The transfer quality is inferior to the print I saw in 1990. The subtitles are useless and they are only half sentences at times on the screen and you are wondering what you are reading. The soundtrack is off and it is irritating. If you are a fan of the author or the movie, get the DVD, but you must understand a little Spanish."
3,DVD not worth the price!,"This film IS beautifully filmed and acted. But the soundtrack is not synchronized with the actor's dialogue and it is frustrating to watch. Also, the English subtitles are messed up. Complete phrases and sentences are missing. If one is not fluent in Spanish, the English subtitles are of no use.I was disappointed to have purchased an inferior product."
3,Works okay....,"But its not the best... The plug that goes into the pad seems to be too small, and even when it is working it doesn't seem to flow over the entire pad. It keeps the hot parts of the laptop cool... when they're right on top of the fans. I like gear head's stuff, but this seems to be poorly designed."
5,An 11 year- old 's review,"If I could give this game over 5 stars, I definitely would. This is an excellent game!!! I got it for Christmas, and since then, I've played it every chance I get. All my 18 other games have been gathering dust since 12/25/05. I would reccomend this game to all ages. You can get sheep, cows, and chickens. You can also get a horse and a dog. You also pick a girl to become your girlfriend,and,if you try hard, to eventually become your wife. There's a whole lot more to this game than raising crops, as you'll find out if you buy the game. I guess I'm not doing a very thourough job of describing this game, am I? Well, I absolutely LOVE this game, so buy it now! I think that pretty much everyone would like this game!"
5,Awsome Game!!,"Well, my friend had this game and told me it was really fun so I decided to go and pick it up. I always play this game! It is so addicting, you would think it would get boring but it dosn't... There are lots of events in every season. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes adventure games!"
1,Disappointed,"I got this game after playing Harvest Moon; A Wonderful Life on GameCube. There is no comparison. This game is boring and progress is VERY slow. Go for the GameCube version...you won't be disappointed. FYI: ""linking up"" is certainly not worth the money you spend on the Friends of Mineral Town."
5,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER EXEPT ONE EXEPTION,THIS WAS AN AWSOME GAME I PLAYED IT HOUR AFTER HOUR BUT I WAS CONVICTED BECAUSE I AM A CHRISTIAN AND IT HAS A HARVEST gODDEST AND YOU CANFESS YJOUR SINS TO HER!!!!!!!!!1 CAN YOU BELIEVE IT AS HARD IS IT WAS I THREW THIS GAME AWAY LITERALLY BUT I THINK I MADE A RIGHT DESCISION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
4,"Good Game, but not real","The game is realy good ,but real farming is a little different. First no shipment boxes. They use trucks. And cattle and sheep, you don't usally brush. Horses onlybefore you ride them. Wanna real farming game buy 'John Deere American Farmer."
5,WoW!!!!!,"Ok i need to start off with i am extremely addicted to harvest moon...and i must say i was disappointed with harvest moon:save the homeland...why....i found that you couldnt get many upgrades for your home....and omg where are the veggies in this one there arent many at all....lately alot of games after they made a dud game they usually come out with another dud....but not this one with over 15 veggies to choose from and with many expansions for your home...and with an excellent story line, who can be upset???"
4,The Best Ever!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this game at chistmas and it is the best game ever!You start out with your dog and you get your horse pretty soon after you start the game.I am already very far in the game.I have already gotten my wife and my son(he is 3 now)I have 8cows and 8 sheep and 8 chickens.My horse loves me and so dose my dog and family. It is the best game ever! GET THIS GAME YOU WILL LOVEIT!!
5,Harvest Moon is the best.,"The first Harvest Moon game I've played that I can remember. I love this Harvest Moon, its one of my favorites even though its the guy version. Its so much fun and I love that its on the gba. I love the graphics of the gba, they're one of my favorite things."
5,Best simulation rpg of all time!!!,"This game has proved it's capabilities with ps1, ps2, gameboy, snes, n64, and now gameboy advanced. Likewise to the BTN game, harvest moon allows marriage, recipes, mining, etc. With it's 32 bit graphics this game is easily the best handheld game currently out. The only drawback of the game is it's ""rucksack"", now only allowing 2 tools to be withdrawn at a time. Compatible with the upcoming Gamecube version, this game has set new and exciting possibilities for Natsume. If you aren't already online or at the store ordering then go now to purchase a phenominal new genre of gaming!"
5,i love it,"ok then i just got this game it,s like the playstaion version it,s just a spitting image of harvest moon back to nature put on a hand held you can get married to 5 girls and have a son and you can get a horse buy this game"
4,Wonderful game,this is a great game must get it. there are so many seacrets and events and everything...
4,its the simple life for me,"you may think that a game that you can actually play as long as you want would get boring, right??? WRONG!!! this is such a detailed game that you cant get bored if you tried! with people to interact with and animals (and maybe even a certain lady friend)to care for you have so many things that you can do and there are so many things, it just depends on your mood. watever you want, now to me thats a great game, you dont have to do anything you dont want to, dont want to farm, easy! mine or care for animals, dont want to marry a girl, fine be as lonely as you want, you want to do it you go for it!!! this is one of the best games i have ever played and if you read this(like i do if i ever want to buy something) then your wasting valuable time playing harvest moon!!! so get to it your life awaits!!!"
4,A Very Cute RPG Game,"This was my first harvest moon game so it's very dear to me, the feeling of it is good, you get married and have a baby son. you are a farmer who came back to see an old friend, sadly he passed away and his wish was to pass his farm to you. automatically you accept and start your new life as a farmer, you can raise livestock, sell crops, and raise a horse until it's owner says you can keep it or not. There are festivals in the village and you probally don't want to miss it. the characters have different responsibilites and personalities, and they are sometimes very humerous like REAL people, the game is just like life as a farmer, but with a little more childhood perspective, but you get to see what it's like to be an adult, and learn about the farmer within. (NOTE:Buy this game and you might wanna look at some HM fansites for tips)"
5,Harvest Moon games rule!,"Harvest Moon games are always fun and addictive. My favorite one was 'Back to Nature' on PSOne. I coulden't stop playing that for months! It was a truly unique gameplay experiance. Friends of Meneral Town looks like a handheld version of the amazingly great PSOne game, Back to Nature! That is a great thing because you can play this on trips and stuff. I havent played this yet but i'm sure its going to be awesome. What can they mess up? We need more series like Havest Moon. More unique games that stand out from the rest. Support good gaming and buy this game. Its gonna be great!"
5,I can't put it down!!!,"I need you to know how ABSOLUTELY AWESOME this game is. I'm 23 years old, playing with my very first game boy, and after realizing that playing the old classics like Zelda and Mario had just become too frustrating, I purchased Harvest Moon. I CANNOT PUT IT DOWN. I swear I'd rather tend to my farm then do absolutely anything else in life. You have to buy it!"
5,Awsome game (but it might get boring),"this game is great. you can do everything you could have done in the older havrest moons and more. this game is fun but you don't have a real obective.grapics 5 out of 5 this games graphics are great for a gameboy advance game nice 3d graphics.controls 4 out of 5 the controls are good but they are slighty complecated but later you will get use to it.story 3 1/2 out of 5 this is one of the worst parts the story is about you going to sombody farm and having a great time then he dies and you take over his farm, thats it.I gave this game a 5 out of 5 because its very fun but it can be repetitive. hope this helped."
2,"Compared to HM:AWL,this game is meh","I got HM:A Wondeful Life and LOVED it,simply LOVED it!I played until midnight the day I got it,and kept on playing every day!I decided to try the GBA HM a spin and I was disapointed with what I got.Time goes by to quicker than in AWL and the years take too longThe biggest problem is that it gives you no reason to keep going.In AWL,as the years go by,you get married,have a kid and watch him grow and help influence his career;sure,you can get married and have a kid in this one,but that only means you get to talk to them everyday so they don't hate you.In AWL,you can do so much with your son,here you just talk to him.These days,I have stopped playing AWL and FOMT is forgotten.But I'll always love AWL and hate FOMT"
5,Deep Sleep,Thse CDs work. They will help you fall asleep and stay asleep. Plus you awake feeling very rested and full of energy.
5,Amazing!,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! This books was so much fun to read! The description of how the people are killed by the cockroaches is descriptive. There is a lot of carnage in the book. I could wait to reach chapter after chapter to see what happens next. I would definitely read this book again. an amazing ride!"
5,Wonderful!,"I have many cat books, but this one is my most prized. Filled with an incredible amount of information and gorgeous photos, The New Encyclopedia of the Cat is a cat enthusiasts' heaven. I also own The Encyclopedia of the Cat, and I was slightly disappointed that it didn't have the amount of new content that I thought it would. Otherwise, I love it. It's easy to read, easy to understand, absolutely purr-fect!"
4,A very interesting and fun examination of our furry four legged felines.,A rather extensive look at the origins and development of the Domestic feline. Includes most (I'm not a cat expert) common varieties and breeds of all cats.
4,Excellent Introduction to Felines,"This book was great, although it did lack in some answers to questions I've been pondering about my cat. Take for example, no where did the author answer if cat's do indeed have short term memories, why my cat nibbles on my hand for affection ( or what seems like affection), or what the various movements and positions of a cat's tail mean in communication. This, however, does not take away from the fact that it's a great read and introduction to understanding your cat and where it came from. I'd definitely recommend it to all cat owners and fanciers!"
4,"Book was great, but in imperfect condition","i hate to complain, but this was advertised ""like new."" i would have said this was ""good"" at best... there was some mysterious smudge on the front of the paper book cover, which i cleaned off. the paper cover was nicked, also, and i could not fix that. the book content was very good though. just the paper cover was definitely not ""like new"". i gave it 4 stars because it was not the author's fault..."
1,a book chasing its tail,"They tried to prettify this book with pictures, but ultimately it's a book that doesn't quite know what it is, other than pop-derivative mumbo jumbo. Daniel Quinn has pulled some fuzzy lint from his navel and tried to make something from it, but the results are disappointing and hardly readable. More fuel for some type of cult book, but ultimately a waste of time."
5,Proof of the validity of Quinn-tesential thought?,"In mathematics, one way to test the validity of an equation is to try it backwards.Here, Quinn does just that, and gives a fun ride while he does so.With this fun tale of the course of humanity in reverse, we see the unfolding of Quinn's hypotheses for a best potential future, and it seems to be a very successful one: new ways of regarding ourselves in relationship to the planet and each other which are not merely pie-in-the-sky utopian fantasies, but down-to-earth examples of how revolutionary the bare, naked truth - drawn from biology, anthropology, sociology, theology, and other ""ologies"" - can be (of course, you'll need to read his other works to really get the full scope of what I mean)... Great little gem of a book."
4,Serendipitous!,"The Man Who Grew Young is beautifully crafted, and unveils more splendid ""Quinn-isms."" And Tim Eldred illustrated it gorgeously! It's another book to encourage the incremental growth and change desired by those ""with ears to hear and eyes to see"" - fans or not."
3,"Wow, a little bizarre but pretty cool!","This is a very unusual story to come across in a comic book, though the plot itself has of course been done before, especially in a sci-fi book.This story is all about a man who lives in the world where things go ""backwards"" all the way from the modern times to the untamed prehistory, yet people seem to take it as the normal way. In fact, those characters have NEVER ever heard of ""death"", especially since all babies go back into their mother's wombs at the ""end"" of their lives. (Isn't that a romantic notion?)The man is the ""odd"" one out, since he doesn't have a mother anywhere to return to her womb. So he goes on a guest that lasts many thousands of years before he finally finds the ""answer"". And he encounters many interesting people along the way, like women ""without"" husbands, wise old men who pass along wisdom, and families that come and go. Very nice artwork with more than a touch of realism in it - no muscular superheroes or beautiful women, sorry."
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money,"First off let me say I wouldn't have even given this 1 star had I been given the option. This is the worst CD that I've bought in a long time, and I buy alot. I liked ""California Dreaming"" so I thought I'd pick up their album and check it out. BIG MISTAKE, every track on the CD sounds just like ""California"" just with different cheezeball vocals. If you like ""California"", buy the single, though there were 2 different versions of the song on the album, and only one was anygood. These guys are talentless hacks, Don't Waste Your Money, and if you do, Don't Say I Didn't Warn You. I feel bad for the pawnshop thats gonna have to try and sell this when I'm done with it."
1,This book is a complete joke!,"Okay I need to point out one thing... THE KOREAN SCRIPT (HANGUL) IS NOT A IDEOGRAPHIC SCRIPT OR SYLLABARY, IT'S AN ALPHABET!!! IT LITERALLY TAKES SOMEONE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE ONLY A FEW HOURS TO LEARN THE KOREAN ALPHABET AND READ IN KOREAN!!!"
1,Not happy with it.,I bought this based on the reviews. I was not happy with it. It is very wet and sloppy. I don't care for the smell either. I was hoping for a deodorant that I could use occasionally as a respite from anti-perspirants. I can't recommend this product.
3,"witty, but not as focused as it could be","This book is indeed witty, you will not get bored when reading it. Unfortunately, the jokes use half of the book, leaving not too much space for the CorelDraw itself. They explain what the function of each button is, and show how to draw rectangles and fill them with fancy colors. However, seldom do the authors go beyond these trivial things. It was my first book on CorelDraw, and I feel that this book was not enough to learn to use Draw. Another frustrating thing is that the tutorial files, which were supposed to pe posted on the web, are not there yet, although the book came in July 99, and I am writing this review in November. So be prepared to skip some chapters since you do not have the files to work with."
4,Galician bagpiper rocks,"While visiting Galicia,Spain last summer I was drawn to the local gaita (bagpipe) music a tradition that dates from the time when the Celts lived in this green corner of Spain. At a local tavern in Santiago, the bartender was playing the cd by Xose Manuel Budino titled ""Arredor"". It was modern gaita backed by a strong rhythm section robustly playing that was very energizing. Budino is a consummate artist,very much on top of the intrument. There is even one lovely lament with voice in one of the selections offering respite from the fast-paced other tracks. I highly recommend this artist and music to those that love Celtic music or pan-world music or those not familiar with Galician musicianship."
2,Used Dreamcast VMU.,"The Dreamcast VMU that I bought was a used one. When I got it in the mail, I went to try it on my Dreamcast with some new batteries, but the VMU that I bought didn't even work. It would disconnect the controller whenever I plug it in, the buttons don't work right, and the thing would restart itself on its own. I would recommend buying a brand new Dreamcast VMU for a little more so you waste money on something that doesn't work."
1,Lack of Memory Space!,"For the price ..., you would expect much more than this. Sure it can be used to play little mini-games, but do we really want to play these when we can play games in full color on television? The memory card itself only holds 200 blocks (128KB). It might sound like a lot, but games like NFL2K1 take up 163 blocks of memory! For a next-generation system this is basically a storage device from 1970. Floppy disks, which cost less than a quarter can hold 1.44 MB! ... Too bad its the only one that works with the Dreamcast."
3,"Might be good, but why should it be needed?","This device might be needed, but why doesn't Dreamcast have that built into the console itself? Hmmm... I wonder. ;-)People who wish to buy Dreamcast in the future need to know about this extra necessity (at extra cost): what I would call a gimick. It's a sleezy thing to do, really, in my opinion, not providing game saves within the console itself when it is a basic function needed by many games. You think you have everything you need when you buy Dreamcast, but oh, no."
3,I hate batteries,the VMU was one of the best peripherals in gaming history I love it and I play the mini games it has like the chaos game in Sonic but the batteries aaaggghh! I hate the batteries in nearly two weeks the VMU batteries was out of run I replaced since Sept. 9 the batteries 5 times so.....that's a problem
3,Good vmu,"my vmu has kept up with all my new games and saves almoset anything, but the only prob is i cant get it to turn on anymore"
4,VMU is worth the cost,"As most gamers know, the accessories made by the system manufacturers... in this case, Sega... is generally more reliable than the peripherals made by third-party manufacturers. Dreamcast VMUs are no different. I purchased a third-party memory unit... it didn't work... especially when trying to save files from larger games, like NBA 2K. I later found that this was a common complaint with that particular manufacturer. I turned it in for the Sega VMU. No problems since. Only setback... if you play games on the VMU itself (not hooked to the Dreamcast), the batteries run out FAST. However, if you use it strictly as a memory unit, it is better than sufficient."
4,The Batteries,"This little mini gameboy/memory card is great, but there are 2 flaws 1. lack of memory for games that take up many blocks. I don't have a solution that but I do have a place where you can get those hard to find batteries. I found it on the internet ... On the top left search for ""CR2032"" and there is your battery. Overall I gave it a 4 stars baecause of the battery problem. Otherwise no problems."
3,It's cool but...,I like the look of this VMU (like a mini gameboy) but I can't figure to save my game without overwrite the existing game (say...you can do this with Playstation Memory by saving in a different block) I ended up erased my friend's favorite car with mine.
4,good,"I personaly love this memory unit its alot better than any previous memory units. You can link up with other VMU's and trade, also playing the mini-games is fun. Intresting things are displayed on the screen while playing. The problem is the battery's die right away and take two battery's to replace."
2,Horrible!,OK the good thing about this memory card (which made me give it 2 stars) was that you can play mini games on it and do some other kinda cool stuff. The bad part about this memory card is that it is the biggest RIPE OFF! A sports game and most games take like 180 blocks this game has 200! If you have a lot of games like me you will need like 5 of these or you can get a mega memory card. Like I did :)
3,Old Reliable,"I have to say, this card is VERY reliable. I can always got back and have the exact same results, but the only problem is that it has only 200 blocks. With that, you'll find yourself buying more games and more VMUs. I sure wish it had a lot more capacity. Oh well, maybe Sega will develop a more advance VMU(yeah right...)"
4,SEGA VMU,"I personally love the VMU, the only drawback is the fact that it requires 2 batteries. I wish Sega would also release a plain Memory Card so we can just use the VMU for the games, and not as a full time Memory card"
3,They are alright but just dont have enough space on them.,The VMU has some cute features like mini games and it can be your watch so you know what time it is. It has other cool features. But i dont reccomend it because all it holds is 200 blocks of memory. Get the 4 slot 200 block each slot memory cards. It worked great for me. I just forgot what brand it was made by so youll have to look for it closely if you want it. The VMU is just kinda a waste of money. ONLY GET ONE OF EM DONT EVEN THINK OF GETTING 2!
4,memory,the sega visual memory unit or card was hard to understand at first but once you get use to it you will uunderstand each thing it does and soon you will be able to do everything you need to do
2,Been burnt by bad VMU,"The VMU is a great product, in general, but the VMU that I purchased was faulty. The impact: After completing Soul Caliber (days and days of playing), the VMU stopped working and wiped out all of my data. The lesson: Buy two VMUs, and use one as a backup for the other. Otherwise, beware of data loss!"
5,THE BEST,"This is the best ever you can play mini games from the internet, or from other games like Sonic Adventure. It also displays secret stuff in gameplay."
3,Excellent but needs a little work...,"The reviewers have already stated that the VMU's battery power is vary limited, which is true. One of the best ways to save power is to stop playing games on it. Why would you play VMU game while you have a Dreamcast sitting right in front of you? The coolest thing about the VMU is the LCD screen being a big plus when playing sports and other video games. Maybe thay didn't think of it yet but I'm hoping in the near future the VMU's LCD screen will light up so you can read information while your playing in a dark room. that would be perfect..."
3,"hold up wodee its good, but needs to hold more memory!","The Sega Dreamcast VMU is a great idea to come up with but that thing holds no kind of memory.NFL2K and SONIC take up way to much so does NBA2K.It leaves no room for anything else it leaves you to buy a lot of the VMU's.Sega needs to over think its capacity of the VMU. Other than that its perfectly find,but Sega should bring out a second version VMU(stronger)!"
4,a must have for a true dreamcaster,they've done it again this a great thing but for sonic adventure the chao aventure take mare than half of it up!!!!!
1,waste of money,Why change the way memory cards have been made. With this new memory card it looks like a gameboy. Next time think about what you make. Also theres not enough space.
4,"If you like it rough, this VMU is the best!","This memory unit has a slightly bumpy texture, and a removable cap to protect the connectors. There is a common myth that there are only 4 buttons, but as any sega afficinado knows, the d-pad is considered a button in itself, raising the total to 5 buttons. The screen is made of a transparent plastic material to protect the sensitive flat-screen lcd monitor."
4,If you have a Dreamcast you need a VMU!,If you have a Dreamcast you need to have a VMU. Especialy if you have it connected to the internet. Like a memory card a VMU saves game information like options and seasons but you can also download animations and VMU games on the internet.However there are also bad things about the VMU. Sometimes one game takes up almost all 200 blocks of memory. There are only a few VMU games to download and the only one I really liked was Tetris. A VMU costs ... dollars when a normal memory card costs about [price].Still I think all Dreamcast owners should have at least one VMU and maybe some normal memory cards or an 800 block memory card. Or more VMUs if you don't care about any of the problems.
1,only buy if your prof forces you to,bad book it is not detailed enough although its pages go on for ages. it jumps from topic to topic and adds sub issues which it doesnt explain this story behind that story
4,"A perfect gift for a guy. However, it may get pricey later.","If you're a woman and have no idea what to get your guy, get this!! I got this shaver yestarday and couldn't wait to write a review. The whole WET SHAVING is great because you can use it in the shower to get a closer shave because you are constantly rinsing your face which will always lubricate your face. The ""goo"" cartridge is great also because it is built in.Also, there's an adjustable trimmer head for facial hair.The only negative is that accessories might get pricey. Maintenance and assessories might go for about $$$$$ per year."
2,The worst razor for you dollar,"Not only does this shaver jam each time I attempt to shave my dog, it also doesn't float when I use it as a toy boat when playing with my children in the bath.The design, however, is sleek and the goo tastes delicious.Bad overall though. Bad. Do NOT buy."
2,Great shave but . . .,"I upgraded to this razor from another brand which I felt was too rough on my face. This razor gives a nice smooth and quiet shave. The lotion dispenser works well.My two issues with the razor are:* Portability - The recharge holster is a modern looking gadget which looks cool but is too bulky for light traveling. In addition it needs a flat surface to sit on making it difficult to recharge at the nearest outlet to your suitcase in a hotel room.* Detached trimmer - My biggest disappointment with the razor is that the trimmer is a separate attachment that requires you to remove the shave blades and push in a different top. I prefer the all-in-one units with the flip-up trimmer. When I'm shaving (either in shower, bathroom sink, or car on the way to work) I don't really want to fumble with different attachments just to trim the side burns.Overall, nice shave but a bit clumsy on the usability. For me it's not worth the upgrade cost - I will probably return this."
4,Close shave when you use the gel feature,"This product delivers when you take the time to wet your face and use the included shaving cream/gel. It provides a very close shave with little irritation (rarely any). However, if you're going to wet your face down apply shaving cream and shave, why not use a blade?When used for a quick, dry, shave, this product does an average job. It gives me a relatively close shave, but irritation is definitely increased.Decent shaver, not sure if its worth the money though."
4,Excellent Product!,"Very nice product, I used it on my 2003 Hyundai Tiburon and works like a charm, no need to do nothing, the only thing you have to do is to remove some aditional mounting points, but besides that fits perfectly."
2,Not a great install kit,I tried installing this in my 2005 sonata and no matter how you install it the deck stays loose. I returned this item due to this.
5,This Kit Was A Bargain!,"This kit was a deal! I replaced it with an older kit bought from another popular on-site electronics company. This kit only cost about a third as much as the other kit, and it is built so much stronger. The finished product looks fabulous in my 2005 Sonata. Total install time only took about a half hour. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!"
1,A steaming sack of crap,"This game is so lame, the targeting blows and the battles are terrible. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
4,Amazing debut release,"This is a very well produced first effort from an unknown band. An interesting mix of pop ballads, instrumentals, and heavy stuff. The lead singer takes charge from the opening track and we are drawn to each subsequent track. The beauty and simplicity of her talent is best showcased on the track ""Open Ends"". They never allow themselves to become overly serious. I especially enjoy their sense of humor(listen to Halloween). I look forward to hearing more from this fresh new talent."
4,Euro - bound,Purchased this not knowing what i would actually need for my travels to Europe. I travel for work and what i didn't need my client did so this was the perfect purchase.
4,Works well so far,"I bought it recently and then took it to an Asia trip. It is a bit heavy, but it had worked well for both settings during the trip."
4,Good Deal,"Was a great little kit. Took it to India with me and it survived the trip. There's only two little issues; 1) Sometimes it's too heavy and won't stay in the socket 2) The case doesn't stay shut real well. Those were just two minor things though, other than that I was very happy with it's performance."
2,Worthless transformer,"The adaptors work fine. The transformer melted the 1st time we tried to use it. Also the hinge on the case broke very quickly. Sooo, we are on our trip in Europe and cannot use curling irons, etc. for fear that we will fry them."
3,power converter travel kit,What can I say cheap the box doesn't open all the way (trimmed it a little and is ok) will see how it works in June in Italy.
1,Fry your hair with this.,Bought this based on another review. What a mistake! First the storage box did not stay closed from the begaining. It worked fine for charging the cell phone and camera batteries. It made my wife's flat iron so.... hot it fryed her hair and blew up her $100.00 flat iron. The box says for curling irons. My wife has used another brand and never had a problem. The only reason we bought a new one is she dropped the old one and it broke.Think twice before buying this.
3,Not so bad...,"I have had this now on 2 trip to Switzerland and Germany. I did not use the voltage converter, only the plugs. The adapters worked great, although trying to figure which ones you need so you only pack the correct ones is not easy, the ""manual"" in the package is no help. The plastic case is cheap and broke while in my suitcase during the flight over. The adapter however are great. They have traveled well and some, the ones I have used, stack together for storage and creating a longer plug if I need it.If you are looking for just the adapters this is a good value. I can't comment however if the voltage converter works."
3,50 - 1600 watt Converter/Adaptor,It worked fine for charging our phones and curling iron but could not get it to work for AA battery recharger for my camera. Not sure what I did wrong. I liked the very sturdy plastic box which kept everything in it's place.
2,foreign electrical plug adaptors,"The main one doesn't project far enough to fit into european sockets. (two round prongs)many times the european outlet is setin, therefore the prongs need to be longer ora mechanism is needed to project the prongs.further, nothing accomodates the ground portion of an american plug.But that is probably not needed in Europe."
3,Inverter unable to be used,This is a great set for travelling abroad. I am in Germany as I write this and have made use of the smaller attachment. Unfortunately the plugs here are inset with a circular plug and the inverter cannot be used. Also it would be nice if ther were an adapter for three prong plugs.
1,you get what you pay for,Plugged the transformer into the wall in Ireland and less than and hour after we smelled what appeared to be burning and found it melted and smoking. I am glad that we stayed in the room. I fear the circumstance would have been worse had we wondered out to look around. I have no plans to return it. You get what you pay for.
3,All Purpose,It was everything I needed for my trip to Europe. I probably did not need the converter but took it just in case. Easy to travel with.
5,LOVED IT!,"I used to watch this animated series when I was younger, and lately I've been trying to get my 9 year old niece into the old cartoons that I was into so I purchased this hoping and praying she'd love it too, and SHE DID! It's as great as I remember, and we both love to watch it together! Great series, wished there was another to follow!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful,This was just as wonderful as I remembered from when I was a kid. I now watch it with my boyfriend's children and they love it too!
5,they just don't make'em like this anymore <3,"sighhh.. i really love this show. i got all nostalgic from one of those Facebook trend things and started looking for all my favorite childhood cartoons. was ECSTATIC when i found this!! great buy. arrived brand new and factory sealed, DVDs run great, picture quality is just how i remembered when i was a kid, probably a step up since it's on my DVD... or it could just be my imagination lol. definitely reccomend!"
5,The Classic Cartoon Series is finally on dvd,"I didn't even know this was coming out on dvd. I saw one episode posted at the video section of Myspace and that brought back some memories. Then I saw this at the store and was glad to see it was actually released on dvd. So I of course bought it for my niece right away, well so I can watch it with her of course lol. I don't know why the show isn't included on Toon Disney. It's by far one of their best cartoon series, if not the best. It's original and a nice harmless show with adventure and fun for kids. It's sad that I'm 28 and I still find it entertaining lol. I also like that there's a whole season on each disc. Now if only they released the next volume soon, really soon lol. Watching the show now it just seems unappreciated by Disney. I think it's the best series they ever had, it was so good they should make a movie instead of making sequels to each Disney movie that ever came out. I mean we don't need a Sword in the Stone sequel."
1,"Great cartoons, bad DVD","I'm impressed that Disney is comming to their senses and putting out this old vintage stuff on DVD, I remember this series from when I was a young kid, I originally said in the review for ""Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers"" that these DVD's are not worth it because I only liked the theme song but now I changed my mind. The animation is superb, the story is wonderful, and some of the characters(Cubbi and Sunni) are cute!I'm not happy because all they had on the DVD were episiodes of the TV series only no bonus features whatsoever, not even interviews with the original voice actors, I know bill Scott is dead but June Foary is still around along with corey burton.Disney this is still your property please treat it with respect!!"
5,one of the greatest cartoons ever!!!!,"this series is one of the best ever created! i never tire of the gummi bears. it has the perfect character creation as all bears have their very own unique and distiguishable characteristics and personalities. this cannot be said about 99 percent of series on the market. disney really put alot into this cartoon. i watch it every weekend with my 8 year-old and she in enchanted with them just as much as i am. this cartoon is even better now as an adult as i can fully appreciate the artistic nature and the adult humor that's mixed in with the more innocent humor. it's a true masterpiece and at 23.99 for 59 episodes, you can't go wrong! BUY! BUY! BUY!"
5,Bring them Back!,"Oh How I wish Disney took the time to bring back Gummi Bears to television! My 3 year old loves watching these shows with me while I trudge down memory lane! Dashing and Daring, Couragous and Caring are now his in vocabulary! If you liked them growing up, they are still the same, dependable, lovable bears-->fighting for what's right!"
3,"Brilliant show, so-so picture quality.","The Gummi Bears is my number one all time favourite animated TV show, which is why I was so excited when it was announced it was coming to DVD. IT is a superb animated show, action packed, full of wonderful characters.I do have a problem with the DVD though. There are too many episodes on each disc leading to compression. A dual layered disc can only hold 4 hours of material with good picture quality, if the running time goes over that then picture quality suffers. The first two episodes in particular look pretty bad, in fade ins and outs the picture is actually pixellated. If you do a search for the first episode on youtube, you will actually find a version on youtube with a better picture than on the DVD. Now that is wrong! Splash the cash a bit Disney, if this had been a 4 disc set, there would be no problem! I know i wouldn't mind spending a couple more dollars if it meant better picture quality!"
5,gummi bears bring back good memories,"I love these DVDs. I am so glad my daughter can watch these like I use to. She loves to watch them. She will watch these DVDs all day long, eventualy I do need a gummi break though. The only problem I have is that it is hard to find some gummi bear toy now (that don't cost $300.00)"
5,my favorite childhood cartoons,Great product and shipped very quickly!!! The quality was not hd quality or anything but it almost made it better that way and was more like the old days.
4,Great Value,"For the money, these are a great value. Unlike a comment above, I have not found these short at all, but average in length."
3,good shorts,the grey are kinda see thru. I have a feeling my junk is on display so wear underwear is a must. I like to be free under my gym shorts and the black ones are great.
2,A little on the short side,"I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise. Just to be safe I ordered a large. The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long. The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg."
3,Filling a Gap,"It's good to have commercial copies of these films, even though none of them are up to the films included in Volume I. Image quality is certainly better than DVD-Rs we have had to depend on. A definite must-have for Berkeley fans."
4,busby berkeley collection 2,"nice set especially since this set, i believe. has never been on vhs. so if you are a musical fan and like films of the 30's i am sure you will like this volume 2, tho not up to volume 1 in great scenes still good."
5,Carmen Miranda for ever,"Carmen Miranda, brasileña triunfante en los USA -y por tanto, en el mundo- es un caso claro de amor entre mujer artista y la cámara de cine.Hacía, interpretaba de Carmen Miranda (Se llamara en su papel como se llamara). Como Xavier Cugat o José Iturbi. Estuviera junto a Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Powell, Alice Faye o Grouxo Marx. Muchos de sus films, se salvan por su actuacion. De muchos, es lo que perdura; Sus minutos.Este pack, a este precio, es un regalo. Sobrarán minutos, pero los minutos en los que Carmen ""llena"" la pantalla son inolvidables, impresciendible. Si, son ""malas peliculas"", no estaran nunca entre las ""Equis mejores"". Pero dudo que alguien de canse de ver y volver a ver sus minutos. Carmen Miranda es , sencilamente, vida. Vida contagiosa.Cuando fue la artista mejor pagada... por algo lo fué. Y nadie ha sabido heredarla. Eso que nos perdemos, pues hacen falta artistas como Carmen.Un pack pues de obligatoria posesion. Esde agradecer su existencia,"
1,Busby Berkeley Vol. 2,Very little dancing and too much nonsence including the lead guy who portreyed himself as a fop. Varsity Show is a joke.
4,"Wild, Raucous, and Witty",This collection of Jim Harison's columns is a bit repetitive at times but made me hungry every time I picked it up. Excellent book to take in the car to read while waiting for appointments.
3,Conveniente,Este producto es justo lo que se espera de el. Su calidad de imagen representa la calidad de la serie original televisada en los 90's. El sonido esta aceptable aunque es decepcionante no poder contar con la traduccion en espanol ofrecida en los los paises latinoamericanos. Por otro lado es uan pieza de coleccion para aquellos que recuerdan con nostalgia las animaciones y el humor de la pasada decada.
5,Volume Two coming along with Golden Suns,"So after plenty of lobbying and the internet community speaking out, DuckTales' Pilot, Treasure of the Golden Suns is making its way onto DVD, one Volume too late, but certainly nonetheless, great news. Not in its original movie format, but the 5 parts that went out into syndication after the first run of season one. Disc One includes, Treasure of The Golden Suns (Split into 5 parts), Back to the Klondike, Horse Scents and Scrooge's Pet. Disc Two includes The Firefly Fruit Contest episodes (1-4), Merit-Time Adventure, The Golden Fleecing, Ducks of the West and The Time Teasers. Disc three finished the set with Back Out in the Outback, Raiders of the Lost Harp, The Right Duck, Scroogerello, Double-O-Duck, Luck o' the Dcuks, Duckworths Revolt and the 2 story episode Magica's Magic Mirror and Take Me Out of the Ballgame."
4,Ducktales is a blast from the past,"Anybody who grew up in the 80's knows Ducktales. It was one of the first cartoons made during a Disney creative rennisance. Before Ducktales you had the Wuzzles (anybody remember them?), and Gummi Bears, but DuckTales is really the face of the movement. And it truly is genius.I truly love everything about the show. From the characters (My favorite is Launchpad). The adventure of the stories still keeps my attention.I am so glad that Disney has the sense to release these shows onto DVD.My Son watches this DVD set all the time!"
5,why do you always have to say please!,This book is one of my all time favorites! I've read it to pre-schoolers on up and it's just perfect for how to act at a resteraunt and to incorporate those actions at home or at a family members house. it's basic manners with a rhyming twist! kids love it!
5,MY 4 year old daugher LOVES this book,"My daughter absolutely loves this book. I don't know that it has actually changed her behaviour, but considering it's a book for learning, she loves it. I think it's the illustrations that are particularly inviting and that she relates to. I think she likes to see all the silly things that Max does. I love the oddball sense of rhyming and the brilliant use of colour in the otherwise black and white drawings. And, it makes you feel like you are teaching them imporant lessons."
1,Only the package is nice!!,"I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in this software program. I purchased this program for my 6 year old and 8 year old who are struggling with reading. The games available in each of levels are in no way fun and they drag on FOREVER!!! They quickly grew annoyed with the woman's voice in the program as she only said two or three things over and over (""Way to Go"", ""You Did It"", etc.). Neither of the kids enjoyed any part of the program. The directions were very ambiguous. We have found numerous parts of the program that just plain did not work right. This was a total ripoff!! Stay away."
1,I'm disappointed,"I've been searching for a phonics software for my almost 5 years old. First the installation is quite unfriendly. It requires installation of each of the 11 CDs! That kind of set the tone for the software. From the package, it claims it supports 600*800 or higher resolution. When we start up the software, it 'friendly' changes the resolution and then errored out complaining it requires running in small font. When we attempt to go to their support website, the link is not good! Finally after changing the computer configuration, we manage to get it to run. I tried the first 2 CDs. Maybe it's good at drilling but there is no way that that it attempts to teach the kids of the letter sound of the alphabets. In one session, it let us pick the alphabets and there are pictures associated with them. Someone in the right mind would sound out the pictures and the letters but not this software. I think I just wasted my money on this software."
3,Not the Greatest,I got this for my 5 year old daughter and she got board with it incredibly fast. There was nothing to let her know if her answers were correct or not. There was no reward system at all. I would try something much less expensive.
4,My son loves to watch this,My five year old is a rail fan. He loves the train songs and the fire truck songs.
3,the best reg album next to barrio fino!,it's just plain awsome and i don't even like like reggeton a must have for all fans
3,Bad Shipping Good Guitar,The Guitar itself works just fine along with everything that came with it but the shipping was bad and left a piece of the guitar chipped off during the process. If your looking for something only to learn how to play on then its a great buy if your want something flashy to show off then you might not want to take the chance.
3,cute but unconfortable.,"they look really nice and feel soft but the back of the shoe cuts into the back of your foot, even after the first day they are almost unbearable. They look so cute it's sad to see them go to waste."
4,For fans of the Mushroom Planet series,"If you're a fan of Eleanor Cameron's Mushroom Planet series, this is something you'd want to add to your collection: it's actually a part of the series, though it's very little-known and hard to find.The book consists of two short stories which take place late in the series, between ""A Mystery for Mr. Bass"" and ""Time and Mr. Bass"". In the first, the boys meet a mysterious but kindly Mycetian lady who takes them on a dream voyage; in the second, David accompanies Prewytt Brumblydge on an expedition to recover a brumblium meteorite. The stories are rather brief and unremarkable, except that they're such a hard-to-find part of the series.If you can't find a copy of this anywhere, email me at lordpeyre@yahoo.com, and I can see what I can do to help."
1,BAD game. Avoid it like you would a STD.,"If I could have given this game zero stars I would have. ""Horrible"" doesn't quite capture how bad this game really is. If you want a futuristic flight sim get something else like one of the old Wing Commander games, Starlancer, or even Freelancer. I'm not going to waste more time thinking about this pathetic game ... thus ends my review."
3,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with the drawstring. The first time I tried them on the whole drawstring came out. It had no aglets on the end of the string which made it near impossible to get the drawstring back into the shorts. It is a short string that is made very cheaply. Other than that I like the shorts.
4,Useful but not perfect,"A fine planning map. BUT if you are traveling extensively in smaller places in the countryside you may want a map that has the place names in Thai as well as English so you can try to match road signs (often only in in Thai) to the place names. This map only has the English. You can find maps that have both locally in Chiang Mai.On the other hand, if you're traveling with public transportation you'll always find someone who speaks English to translate for you. So in the end it wasn't much of a problem for us tho it would have been fun to know where we passing through when we were on a bus."
3,I don't recommend this product for a major project.,"I tried to clean up scratchs on a 110 gallon acrylic aquarium I bought used, after five hours of sanding I gave up. This product should work fine to remove a small scratch or two but not for a major project. In case you're wondering I did remove the scratchs from my tank with a method I came up with myself. I did not use polish, that is a no no inside of your tank."
4,At long last,"I enjoyed this book on many levels. Such as, the well researched photos and flyers of the time- The old saying, ""we look to our past to know what the future brings,"" comes into play in Mel Gordan's narrative. In a jaded society, there is always room for blushing specatators! The weimar society was a time and place all unto itself. This book shows examples of our past's animal propensities and the natural social contours history bares.A reference must!"
5,Picture book for very decadent children,"In glorious black-and-white pictures and color plates, Mel Gordon illustrates the splendour that was Weimar Berlin. This book is necessary for any uppity later generations who thought they came up with nightlife, sex and provocation."
1,"very little racing,more just beating on junk cars","There was very little actual racing, it was more about a bunch of inner city kids beating on their junk cars. Spinning donuts,doing burnouts and throwing gang signs while hanging out on the street corner. There are a few nice cars, and a little bit of racing, but definately not what is avertised"
5,My new fav!,"Okay I am a ranch kind of girl and on occasion I do french or catalina. I saw this flavor in the store and said I would give it a try....IT IS AMAZING! It is absolutely my new favorite dressing! Beats ranch even! Way better than the standard French or Catalina. Green lettuce, black olives, banana peppers, tomatos topped with this and salad topping - YUMMM! Now my stomach is growling..."
2,SP-510UZ,i'm just a beginner but overall this camera works fine for me. it was a little hard getting used to the pixel settings for sharp clear pictures. but once i figured them out this camera and all the acessories are just great.
2,Where are the Southwesterners?,"I am from California but have been living in Tucson, Arizona for a year, and there are many diverse people here in the Southwest. Desert towns I have been in do not consist entirely of white Americans. Where are the Latinos, Blacks, Native Americans, and Asians? The illustrator needs to get a clue. This picture book might be accurate for the hill towns of Appalachia, but come on now, the Southwest desert populations are diverse, so where are the rest of the townsfolk?"
1,I wish I had skipped this one.,"As a fan of the rest of the series as well as the author's other books, I wish I had skipped this one. It's ""beyond the trials of Job"" story line is not only depressing but detrimental to the rest of the series. Some characters and story lines are poorly developed and created only for subsequent shock value. New characters are introduced, in the epilogue no less. Major series threads are left unaddressed or disappear completely with only superficial explanation. All that which has defined Dion, made her strong and admirable, and the world she lives in is either ripped away or arbitrarily abandons her. Apparently this is done so that she can pursue some nebulous goal which remains just that - nebulous. It could have been the jewel of the series, instead, Wolf's Bane tarnishes all that has gone before. I can only hope that the author plans to remedy this with a sequel or the series will be irreparably harmed."
3,overall its a well written book.,I have always enjoyed the wolf walker series but I think overall this book hurt the rest of the story from the previous books. Harper tries to get the wrong kind emotian from the reader. This book left me depresed because of what happens to Dion. I still sugest Harpers other books though : ).
3,"Okay, but not as good as other Harper books.","This is the fifth book in the Wolfwalkers series. It features the wolfwalker, Dion, as do other Wolfwalker books. The book was well written, but I didn't like where Harper took it. Admittedly, real life doesn't always take us where we want to go, but since I read for enjoyment, I don't like reading books I don't enjoy, and this one fit the bill. I highly recommend the rest of Harper's books, though, and especially the cat series."
2,"Tara, how could you.....?","If you have read the first three novels in the Wolfwalker series (and if you haven't, I suggest that you do) do not, I repeat, DO NOT read Grayheart or Wolf's Bane. Ember Dione maMarin was my favorite character, and Harper destroyed her life. I don't ask for sugar plum fairies and sprites dancing under the pale moon light, but I do expect to be able to read a story without feeling sick to my stomach over the non-stop agony my character is experiencing. Wolfwalker, Shadow Leader, and Storm Runner had plenty of pain and fear, but those emotions were at least balanced by excitement and joy. I don't know what Tara Harper was thinking...maybe she was having a bad year, or maybe she has every intention of making up for it in future novels, but unless she redeems herself, my advice is to stay away from these novels."
4,Excellent naration,The book was very well written and it kept you in supence most of the way through. I am looking forward to his other books.
5,The Series Continues,"This project of gathering, binding and offering the Sunday Krazy Kat comic strips is such a boon. It is a treat to be able to enjoy a strip that was gone before I was born. The art work, the humor, the perspective on life all go together so perfectly in Herriman's work that it would be a great loss to this generation not to have these books available. I look forward to the next volume when it arrives!"
2,"Very cute, but wears out quickly","My son received a set of these ducks as a gift in May. By July they would hardly light up at all. Granted he loved them and played with them often, but you can't even put a new battery in them to prolong their life. Disappointing."
4,4 stars but don't be fooled!!,This C/D is found under the general heading of AMICI when searching this group. It is not the group AMICI we have come to enjoy and when the C/D is inserted in your player it reads as AMIGI. Not a bad musical album but not one by the singing group AMICI. Buyer beware....
4,A gamer,"Fun for a puzzle game, I find it hard to put down. That being said, I wish more attention had been paid to the action components of the game... sometimes the hit region on characters or enemies is a bit weird."
1,Disappointment,"After playing many games, I believe this is one of the worst I have played. Although graphics are wonderful, the plot and game play are slightly poor. It may just be my thoughts, but I belive it was horrible.I have belived that the game sounded fun and exciting, but the cover cruelly mislead me. I do not want to stop you from getting it if you want it, but I am just saying that it did disappoint me."
5,It's a snap to use!,"The Chicco Carseat with the KeyFit Base is incredible. The base has two options for securing it, one using the regular lap harness which works great in our sedan and the other using a built in belt that works best with our small SUV. You just set the carseat on the base and you can hear the snap when it is secure. With the press of one button it releases from the bases. No clumsy fiddling with small or multiple buttons or latches. It just doesn't get any easier than this!"
5,Extra Car Seat Base,We love the extra base for our car seat. It is a great product. It was easy to install and great for first time parents.
5,"A lifesaver for a visual-spacial, homeschooled student","We happened upon this book by chance. It is the first curriculum my child has actually thanked me for and looked forward to doing. I can only hope that this is a taste of the future of textbooks. I highly recommend this book to any educator of fifth through tenth graders, but especially to those who teach visual-spatial students."
5,GREAT book!,I had the fantastic honor of meeting Teri Tibbett in person and my children worked with her for two days. She is such a wonderful teacher and a joy to listen to! She shared from this book and I had to buy it. The information is presented in an interesting way and you can have fun learning history and how music is tied into it. I can't say enough good things about this book--buy it. You wont' be disappointed! Look for her other books at tibbet.com too. Highly recommended!
1,"looks good, didn't work","This TV was a lemon that came with many problems. The design of remote is awful, as is the placement of the DVD opening on top (dust). If you do get one, save the box, because you'll need it on the return.When it didn't work the seller tried to get us to accept several other brands that all had bad reviews."
3,educational,I found this book to be very educational but the author takes too many presumptions with his facts. I admire his devotion but question some of his findings.
3,Old Classic Hab Been Surpassed,"For a long time ""A Doctor at Calvary"" was the best book out there on the shroud and the crucifixion. Howver, Dr. Zuigbe's 2005 book is much better. Zuigbe shows how Barbett got it wrong. He did more extensive and more relistic tests than Barbett to understand crucifixion. I would still recommond you read ""A Doctor at Calvary"" but then follow it up by reading Zuigbe."
4,Excellent introduction,"I found this book extremely helpful in my research. It gives the whole rundown of how the carbon nanotubes came about, the history that led to them (not just another fullerene!) and the ways and means of forming them, identifying them and future possibilities."
5,Shower Chair was just what my parents needed,"I recently purchased this shower chair for my 80-year old parents. A few weeks earlier, my mom was showering when she suddenly felt dizzy. She grabbed the shower curtain as her body moved downward and fortunately avoided serious injury. The next day, I was online shopping for shower chairs. It took a few good whacks on the bottom of the chair legs to snap them into place, but the arms and back assembled easily. The chair, arms, and back are sturdy. My parents have an older bathtub, which is smaller than today's standards, and the chair fits inside fine. The chair sits on one side of the tub and there's still room for them to stand up to shower. I have much greater peace of mind now, knowing that the chair is available for them to use in the shower."
1,Dangerous,If you put the legs above the bottom position they will suddenly without warning disengauge and one will drop tilting the seat suddenly!!! happened 3 times in three showers so I now leave it in the lowest position only. If I were any less agile it would have thrown me to the tub bottom or the floor but I was able to catch the tub sides.
2,Not so secure for those over 100#?,"I got it for my husband a few days ago. The little buttons which change theheight of the chair do not seem to be very secure. When I sit down(95#)they were ok, but when my husband actually used it in a shower,he almost fell down because the some buttons slipped. He weighs145pounds!!"
4,A little too tall,This product will work. However I must say that it is taller than the side of the bath tub and very wide. Therefore water ends up out of the tub and on the floor. Not all people are overweight and need a chair this wide.
1,FLEXIBILITY YOU DO NOT WANT,"A MOBILE BASE NEEDS TO HAVE RIGIDITY BUT DO NOT EXPECT ANY WITH THIS EXTENSION. THE 2"" ANGLE THAT YOUR TABLE LEGS SIT ON IS THIN AND DEFLECTS DOWN WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE TABLE. WHEN MOVING, THE SINGLE FLAT BAR ALLOWS THE EXTENSION TO SHIMMY WHICH WILL LEAVE ONE LEG OF YOUR TABLE HIGHER AFTER YOU STOP REQUIRING YOU TO BEND DOWN AND STRAIGHTEN THE EXTENSION UNDER THE LEGS. MIGHT BE OK FOR LIGHT WEIGHT MACHINE AND OCCASIONAL MOVEMENT. LONG WAIT FOR SHIPPING, LARGE DEMAND OR VERY FEW MADE?."
1,unacceptable,I have already reviewed this on the previous saw. I completed this review and emailed it prior to this one. Thank you.Vernon Harrington
5,GREAT DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I like the DVD. Here are the songs I like from best to bad.Pipe DreamFuture RetroStick FiguresDrum MachineHarmonic VoltageAcoustic CurvesAqua Harp
4,One way to make music visible,"This is an extraordinary, well done effort in beautifully rendered computer animation, and a good way to help engage a child in understanding music. It does not lend itself to lots of repeat viewings as well as the related DVD, ""Illuminated Manuscripts"" by John Banks. This one could be called creatively visualized music, while I. M. is more like flowing, lyrical landscapes suffused with ambient / electronica."
5,Animusic DVD,"For anyone who enjoys pop instrumental music and 3D graphics, this DVD is a must have. The music leans towards John Tesh and Yanni, but not in the sappy kind of way...its well scored and pefect for this 3D application. The 3D graphics, however, are the star of the show. The music is MIDI based, which ""drives"" futuristic instruments (a 3 neck guitar, various string and percussion instruments). The attention to detail is amazing (vibrating strings, flapping drum heads, puffs of smoke from pipes...) and the rendering quality is stunning. Expect to see this technology in major films and video games; its revolutionary and a real acheivement."
2,R W Garcia is crumby!,This item came highly recommended for someone who is pre-diabetic in need of a low carb healthy snack. This snack is about $4.25 for ten ounces in stores. When I found them for $2.82 a bag when you purchase a case of 12 I went for it. The taste is great however about a forth of each bag is crumbs. I got a pound of crumbs total out of three bags. Whether this is from shipping or manufacturing I don't know. I won't purchase on line again.
2,Problems with consistency,"R.W. Garcia Soy/Corn with Flax Tortilla Chips, 10 Ounces (Pack of 12)The first time we ordered this they were fabulous! Great tasting and crispy. We would have given them a 5 star rating. The second order fell short. They were burned and broken. It was as if we received all the rejects, the botton of the barrel, the left-overs after the party. Very disappointing. We would not recommend buying them unless you can physically see what is in the package.R.W. Garcia Soy/Corn with Flax Tortilla Chips, 10 Ounces (Pack of 12)"
4,Delicious but crumbled,"These are great, delicious and healthy chips. My only complaint is that when they come via mail, they are a bit crumbled by the time they arrive. I wish the mail carriers were a bit more careful but besides that the chips are delicious and light. My children love them and I feel good about giving them a healthier alternative for a tortilla chip."
1,like cardboard,"I have tried multi grain chips before, and these are the worst. Too thick, and not very tasty. And I bought a case. Dumb Me!"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased these tortilla chips and was very dissappointed. They are notas thin and tasty as I hoped they would be. The popular brand chips you buy at the grocery store are better. I really wasted my money buying all of these....""what was I thinking"".Now I am wondering what I am going to do with 11 more bags of these."
2,Stale & Salty Classic - was not sent Extra Thins,I did not receive the Extra Thins this time. I was sent the Classic. They seemed a little stale and were too salty. I definitely recommend the Extra Thins because they have always been very fresh and much less salty. Was not happy with this last order.
2,A cookbook jyotish book?,"I found this book to be too much of a ""cookbook"". Information is good, but not enough at all. The section about the divisionals is bad..why tell you how to construct a navamsa or hora chart if she doesn't tell you how to use it during interpretation? It's an okay introductory text..but I strictly mean ""just okay"". Light on Life by Hart DeFouw is *MUCH* better, although you must be more of an intellectual to grasp the information. Dreyers book was written for attention spanned challenged Americans, I think. It was one of the first jyotish books I bought, but I don't refer back to it when I have a question. I couldn't recommend this book."
4,Dry but Precise,"At first I thought this book was going to be very technical and not very informatative however, once past chapter 3 the information seemed to form itself into a whole. I think, for the beginner, the information on the Shodasavargas, Navamsa, Hora, Drekkana, and Harmonics are a bit overwhelming. It was good that they were mentioned, to let the student know that there is much more to learn but they are aspects more suited for the intermediate student. The information is plain precise, and dry. I think, that the lack of flowery phrases helps the beginner to focus in on what is being taught. In short not the most inspirational instruction manual but man is it useful!!!"
5,very easy to follow - highly recommended,This book reads like a novel. Very easy to understand.Probably a very good book to start with if you are new to vedic astrology.Other books (especially written by some Indian authors) assume that you have some background ofIndia's great ancient history/civilization/(vedic religion) etc..- which is awesome to study by itself.But this assumption makes the books difficult to understand for a western mind.The author is very knowledgeable about the subject and has given a lot of details. Highly recommended for a beginner.
5,Awesome product. Automatic Co2 delivery.,"Works so well with any Co2 system. Automatically lets your reactor know when to deliver C02. Once the pH reaches a certain level, it turns off the reactor. Turns it back on again when the pH level begins to rise again. Works fantastic in my self-running fish tank, for the past 4 years."
1,Waste of $$$,"I had the idea that this could be hooked up into my solenoid to deactivate the solenoid when the ph gets below a range I have set. Nope! The damn thing just sits in the water and reads your ph. It is a waste. You're better off getting a drop checker. Not to mention the yellow ph probe is an eyesore.Also, you are given step by step calibration directions to ensure that the readings are correct. They have you calibrate it at a ph of 7 and a ph of 4. They give you a ph of 7 solution to calibrate with...but they don't give you a ph solution of 4 to calibrate with. What garbage!!!I have purchased other products from Milwaukee before...but this was horrible."
2,IT SUCKS!,"I rented this just a few days after it came out and it sucks! If your looking for a good war game the first one is better. it is third person view the graphics are better than the first one but the story line in genral sucks plus, there isnt a big ending"
1,Total trash,I was looking forward to this after enjoying the first one. I was very excited about it having X-Box Live but found out that was a huge lie. Gotham Games needs to sit down with Tom Clancy to get going in the right direction for military style games. This thing still does not let you customize your weapon load out so your stuck with what they give you. Like Cpl. Jones blowing off all his ammo very quickly with that sorry MP-5. Pay attention no one goes into combat in a desert environment with a close quarters weapon. With the occasional building to enter is what your pistol or M-4 is designed for. Camera angles in many spots are very bad and your soldier often blocks your view. The game was also very short it was over too quickly with a very poor ending. I think I will stay away from Gotham Games for a while.
1,what the ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why is it only one player??????????? The only reason the first one was fun was because you could play with four players, idiots. Nice job ruining a good game"
4,Conflict: Desert Storm II- Back to Baghdad review,This is a must have game. It has 3-Demensinal graphics and is oouuttaaa here!!!!!!! most of all this game is war im talkin WAR.....For all u war tpye characters u should check this game ooouuuttt!!!!!
3,Better than the original but still pretty horrible,"Ok, creators of this game. Why a sequal?! It's the same story and the charactors look good but there is some bad animations throughout the entire game. The AI is improved but they aren't as smart. The audio...bad. Just listen to the gun shots and the voices. The worst part in the audio is you have to listen to them. The blood looks like powder. But your teammates are still stupid. Although its still better than the original(How Surprising) it's still below average3 out of 5"
5,A Child's Garden of Verses,I had this book for my daughter when she was a baby in 1974. I loved the illustrations and has a nostalgic need to find the book again. The book I received was in the same good condition that my daughtwer's book would have been.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"DO NOT ORDER from Got Books! I ordered the book featured, with illustrations by Eloise Wilkins which is the book I grew up with and cherished. This book was to be a gift for my grandchild's birthday, now it's too late to re-order PLUS Amazon will not accept a return since I bought it from one of their Amazon sellers. What is the point of being an Amazon seller if Amazon won't stand behind the product?"
4,Child's Garden of Verses,"The product I received was not what I had expected, but a much larger, hard cover edition. I thought I was getting the older version of the one pictured. But I'm delighted with the book itself. It brought back very fond memories of my early childhood."
4,Christian Music CD,"The product is great. It reminds me of when I was saved and Benny Hester was in concert that night at Harvest Christian Fellowship church in Riverside, Ca.."
3,Not as good as Benny From Here,"The only songs I like on this CD are from ""Benny From Here"" AND since this is not that album it is missing some of my favorites. I have had a hard time finding Benny From Here so this will work for now. Benny should definitely re-release Benny From Here!!!"
4,a good introduction for kids,"My daughter read this book when she was 6, and it really got her excited about Greek mythology. True, it's not the most comprehensive account of most Greek myths, but then the stories have to be boiled down quite a bit for very young readers. Complications of the original stories--such as sex and violence--have to be soft-pedaled. I think this books is a good first encounter with Greek myths. After all, it's hard to go wrong when you have those great monsters and heroes."
3,Greek gods with Roman names?,"I'm using this book with my six year old to introduce her to the Greek myths and I agree with the other reviewers here: it's a good book for that purpose, getting kids interested in the material and providing them with some good background on which to build later. Some of the stories are wrong, yes; but what bothered me more was the use of the ROMAN names for the Greek gods instead of the Greek names (e.g. Vulcan not Hephaistos, Diana not Artemis)."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!,"That is exactly what you'll be saying as you read this book. This book was so full of lies concerning greek mythology that it didn't hold water! I can't believe that I am still alive after finishing this book. Please, oh please, don't read this book! If you want to purchase a great book about greek mythology, go to the book search part of Amazon.com. Simply type in ""Greek mythology"" and a whole list of excellent literature will pop up. Now there are so many books to choose from I recommend only choosing the ones with 4 stars or higher. (my personal favorites.) Now, get this book away from me!"
4,Good Microphone...Good Price!!,"The Shure SM48-LC Vocal Dynamic Microphone is a good heavy, quality microphone. I purchased it as a secondary mic to go with the Memorex MKS-SS1 Singstand Home Karaoke System for my two daughters. Turns out...they both prefer or shall I say, ARGUE about who gets to use this mic over the actual mic that came with the Karaoke System. So get two of these mics, if you have more than one child. I would give this product a 5-star rating had it been equipped with an On/Off switch for the same price."
5,so funny,"This show is one of the funniest shows I've seen, right up there with Arrested Development, 30 Rock, and Andy Richter Controls the Universe. It definely deserved a chance to succeed but like so many other great shows was unfairly cancelled"
5,Hilarious!,"Ok, so this show should still be on the air. It's a great show! Good acting, writing, casting, you name it. I think this show was a few years ahead of it's time and would probably still be on the air if it had come out 2 to 3 years after it did. If you are a fan of Anthony Bourdain, restaurants, cooking, food or laughing...get this DVD!"
4,Too bad it got cancelled!!,"I had not heard much about this show apart that it was created by Darren Star and starred Bradley Cooper. I was pleasantly surprised. It is funny, edgy (for a network show), sexy and it makes you want to go to Nolita restaurant to eat one of Jack Bourdain's culinary creations.The only little improvement that could be made...MORE EXTRA FEATURES!Enjoy this show!"
4,Wish there were more...,"As a chef myself, I really appreciate the subtleties of this series. And as a fan of Bourdain, I really enjoy the humor in this series. I just wish the network didn't cut it off before it had a chance. Look at the Food Network today and how many culinary shows are out there. Cooking is the new ""talent-based reality show"". Had they only given this series a little bit longer it would have taken off!With that said, this is the complete incomplete series on DVD. The story was just getting going when it got cut off before the end of the season. (If this IS the complete season, then the finale was weak!) There are 17 episodes (I think) and they're all a lot of fun. Not much else to say...definitely great to own, but I just wish there were more."
3,a good wand effort;two good pieces of music.,"not karajan(1963), nor live(bbc legends) tennstedt, both orchestral works show some vitality with pleasant,delightful qualities. the vibrant beethoven,op.60, enters smoothly after the lively mozart 'finale.preso'; and this inexpensive,well-crafted disc-cool and sophisticated-could interest a fan of other types of music in classical music. the liner notes/booklet was complete,though it over-praised g. wand."
2,..and that's it?,"Ketchum has an engaging writing style and a vivid sense of description. The books opens with a gruesome double homicide and then we leap forward five years. At that point we learn more about the characters, and we learn more, and we learn more- actually your stop learning more and keep learning the same things over and over. There are all kinds of ""mysterious"" things set up in this tale (an erstwhile cat that gets chapters to itself, a new girl suddenly in town from Fresno with some bad habits) but the shoe never drops on them- the cat BTW serves no function. It isn't as if any of these things cause any real tension mostly idle curiosity. The book isn't frightening and the main villan turns out ot be such a small time punk he's really almost pitable. Worse, when the climax finally does come it is suitably gruesome but mostly pointless (one actually will spend some time think, what brought this one) and pretty much devoid of any feeling."
2,Huge Let-down,"I've heard so much about Ketchum over the years, and even met him at a l999 Horror Convention. His classic book OFF SEASON is hard to get, and I've been dying to read (and find)it for under the crazy prices that are charged for it. Leisure has finally put this much acclaimed author's work (THE LOST) on their roster, so I snatched it up the day it was released. Let's see: The prologue was intense, and then there was close to 300 pages of NOTHING. Yes. I said NOTHING but character development and graphic details of oral sex. For the amazing blurb written all over this book's cover (by the likes of Stephen King and Fangoria magazine), I expected much more. Hopefully this was just one of Ketchum's slow moments, because I know that he is highly respected in the genre. I wish Leisure would re-release OFF SEASON and THE GIRL NEXT DOOR so us poor people can see what all the fuss is about.....because THE LOST certainly is nothing to brag about."
1,First and Last,"This is the first Jack Ketchum book that I have read...and the last. This book goes from 0 to 60 before Chapter 1. I found the violent and gory details unnecessary and the characters shallow. Chapters 1 through 37 are filled with mundane details, poor attempt at character development, and predictability. This section of the book creeps along until the last few chapters which are filled with more needless details of nonsensical murders."
3,Not my favorite Ketchum work...,"This was definitely not my favorite Ketchum book. I feel like Ketchum is truly in his element in horror and splatterpunk--- this was more of a crime drama/suspense, and honestly I found myself bored by a lot of it. If you are new to Ketchum and want to try something that will shock your socks off and keep you from sleeping at night, I would recommend starting with ""The Girl Next Door."""
2,Just a dull crime novel...,"I know Ketchum has a strong fan following... and a reputation for reaching certain extremes that a lot of mainstream writers shy away from... but really, there wasn't anything 'extreme' about this book. It's not that the writing was bad... just that the story wasn't very interesting. The characters weren't anything you wouldn't see on the average TV cop show. No surprises... no shocks... no one I really cared about.Ray Pye is just a garden variety sociopath... you wait the whole book for him to explode, and when he does, it's just kind of 'meh'.My understanding is that the book is based on some actual events... but it's missing that quirkiness that true-crime stories usually have, the 'truth is stranger than fiction' element that usually makes the story worth telling.I'll happily read something else by Ketchum, but I wouldn't recommend this one unless you're bored and there's nothing much else to read."
4,Solid Thriller!,"While this one didn't cause me to stand up and whistle, it did make for a fine read.It starts off with a bang as a maniac, along with his two naive highschool-aged friends, kill two girls who are camping. The story then jumps four years ahead and follows the mainac, Ray, and his two friends, and the cop who knows Ray is guilty, and is still trying to nail him.The first half was great, then it slowed down a little with a seemingly pointless subplot involving the cop's cat. Then the ending is an all-out...well, I don't want to spoil it, but whoo-wee!Well-written, albeit not super original, fans of suspense thrillers should enjoy this."
4,"It wasn't trully horror, but it was a nice book.","This book is about a young male named Ray, who basically has friends name Tim and Jennifer (who he is sleeping with)who are afraid of him because of the murders that he did in the woods. A cop who wants to nail him for the murder won't let Ray alone. Ray has to have what he wants and because he doesn't, he basically sets it off. I love the ending because you think you know what is gonna happen or atleast think the author would make you feel good in the end but he doesn't. Well in a way he does, that part you will have to laugh about. But I trully thought this book would be like Stephen King horror, but in the end it was reality horror. Something that could actually happen. Real life drama. It's nice."
5,In your face,"I discovered Ketchum through ""The Lost"" and I've been hooked since. Ketchum never lets up, never tries to sate the reader's desire for a happy ending, never lets you look away. This book is at once a horror tale and a true reflection of the kinds of senseless violence that stems from a contaminated human condition. It's in your face from start to finish. Ketchum is a powerful story teller.-- Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room."""
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Ketchum's ""The Lost"" is a decent book. I must admit I was a little disappointed by it, only because I know the genius that the author is capable of. A very violent, blood-soaked intro and ending, and a lot of attempted character development in between that kind of falls flat. Recommended for Ketchum fans, but not the book I would suggest to a reader wanting to familiarize himself with Ketchum's stuff."
2,Booooring,"After the energy of Off Season, anything is bound to be a dissapointment, but this is just boring. I didn't care about the characters, except maybe the cat, the writing is typically conventional, the plot was weak, I wouldn't say there's a whole lot of developmet going on--i certainly didn't buy that the ""bad guy"" would kill people because he got turned down for a date and isn't as tall as he'd like to be--and i really had to struggle to finish it. It starts well, and ends well, but if you're like me, and want to read this because you like ketchum and/or horror stories just read the beginnign and then skip to the end because a whole bunch of nothing happens inbetween. If you're interested in character development and loss of inocence, read The Bottoms by Joe Lansdale."
4,A Roller Coaster Ride!,"I've now read several Ketchum books and this is the first that truly incorporated plot and character development with Ketchum's knack for grotesque and disturbing violence. Finally, we get an opportunity to understand the backgrounds of his characters and in typical Ketchum fashion, the plot speeds along, twists and turns, and ends with a scene that I will not soon forget with a villian unlike any other you have encountered before. I highly recommend this book but don't plan on getting much accomplished once you start it!"
5,vext is next,"The album is killer starting wtih lyrics right down to the guitar. My favorite is lifes embrace a definite radio smash. the whole album is excelent, but it now because VEXT IS NEXT."
3,"Nice looking shoe, but OK","Shoe look nice and confortable, but it is not breathable. Your feet get very HOT after you wear it for a while."
2,Meagan's Review,"I didn't like this book because there is a lot of killing in this book and I don't like killing because there is a lot of blood involved.The book is about Ezra and her family and they are traveling to find their relatives the Goode's. In Wickham they find one of the Goodes, who has changed her last name so no one would know that she is a Goode. Ezra's father believes that there is a curse on the Fier family because a lot of people have died. First Abby dies then their mother dies. In the middle of the night they would hear Abby's voice and see Abby's ghost and their mother would be calling out Abby'sThe book keeps going back and forth from the Goodes to the Fiers. I found it confusing. It was the most confusing in the middle because when the author was talking about one family I thought they were talking about the other family.I recommend this book to anybody who likes spooky books."
4,A must reader!,"If you like murder mystery, books, then you must read this book. I read the first book and I really enjoyed reading it. The second book was even better than the first book. I won't tell you about the book because you must read it to find out what happens. I'll just tell you this, READ IT!"
1,Don't be fooled by good reviews,"Don't ever order from Airsplat! They get rid of bad reviews for their products by bribing the reviewers. To make matters worse, they don't even follow through with their bribes! It happened to me when I bought this product earlier in 2012. I was very dissatisfied with the shipping time and the fact that they sent me the wrong product, so I wrote a bad review. I later received a call from someone at Airsplat saying that if I took down my review they would send me a bag of free BB's. Since it was only a five dollar purchase, I obliged. I never received the BB's, and I have come to realize that they probably have done this to hundreds of other people as well. That to me is very shady, so I'm never going to order from them again, and I encourage anyone that is thinking about it to take a look at some of their competitors, like AirsoftGI and Evike."
2,Western Feng Shui tips for nonsense,"While visiting my local Feng Shui supplier, I had told them I just purchased Feug Shui tips for a better life foreworded by professor Lin Yun. I was told he was an Feng Shui imposter a Feng Shui con-artist of sorts and that that book contains alot of myths and inaccurate information. If you want to pratice true Feng Shui do your home work and don't believe everything written out there."
