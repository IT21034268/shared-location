3,Sometimes devices lose connection on wakeup,"Works OK mostly, but ocassionally when my computer wakes up, the USB keyboard or USB mouse will not work. Also, on one ocassion, my USB drive did not work when connected to the hub but worked when I connected it directly to one of the computer's USB ports."
2,"Great design, bad implementation","Fantastic design, but even when plugged in, it does not power many of my devices for whatever reason. Example: Even if I have only 2 devices (small external USB 2.0 hard drive and a printer), the hard drive isn't recognized. Add another device, not recognized either. No apparent power issues with USB hub, but maybe that's it.When plugged directly into my laptop, all peripherals work fine. Disappointment."
2,7 Ports - But Which ones work?,"Well my IPOD Nano (latest Generation) can't sync through it that's for sure now. The other ports are iffy, on XP I'll get the random ""boom bing"" for no reason but it thinks ports are disconnecting them selves..I would look for another device.. This isn't a rock solid device or at least with all ports in use it's not."
2,Didn't last 3 months,This USB hub was properly installed on my desk. It failed in 80 days ... I did check it carefully but it's still a dud.
3,worked great for 2 weeks,"I'm not going to slam this, because it has good reviews and i probably just got a faulty one. but after about 2 weeks, the power light showed it was receiving power, but no USB plugged in would be acknowlged. It was utterly useless. I called Amazon who readily replaced it (who doesn't love Amazon service??1!) and i'm giving the second one a try. With 4 kids plugging in MP3 players, my ipod, cell phone, camera charger, etc...i don't know how we lived without this and how we'll survive if this was goes kaput as well!!"
4,Lots of extra USB ports with a tiny footprint,"If you're looking for a lot of extra ports for all your USB devices and don't want some big space age looking thing on your desk taking up space, then this USB Hub is for you!After doing some fairly extensive research on USB Hubs, I found that most all of them are pretty large. I wasn't sure why, but they were. Then I checked out Amazon.com and found this little USB hub with 7 ports on it! Exactly what I was after. Plus it works on a Mac and PC so I could use it on my PowerMac that's got Windows running on it. Perfect!My one complaint is that if you change USB devices a lot, the hub might slide off it's little base. Not a big deal, but worth noting if you're going to be plugging in and unplugging USB devices frequently."
3,Do not use for a USB webcam,"I hooked up my Logitech USB webcam to this hub together with my printer, speakers and wireless mouse but picture quality suffered considerably since during Skype video calls; parts of the picture would occasionally disappear or the whole picture would briefly become red or green. When I hooked up the webcam back to my computer USB connector it worked fine. Maybe the video data stream is too high for this hub?"
1,"Nice design, bad implementation","I'm on my third one, thanks to the very good customer service at Cables-To-Go, but good customer service can't make up for a bad product. Each of the first two devices started to die after about 8 months. Symptoms - external drives spontaneously running autoplay, continually getting the Windows message about new hardware found, as if I'd just plugged in a new usb device, printer not printing. Yes, I did all the diagnostics of using different PC ports to hookup the hub and switching devices to different ports on the hub - all to no avail. I found an old d-link 4 port hub that I'd lost the power supply for, but in my box of old electrical stuff found a compatible p/s so alls good now. I never had a problem with the d-link and am glad to have found it."
1,Worst piece of hardware I've ever encountered,"I bought this hub based on all the good reviews and now I feel it's my duty to warn all potential purchasers out there. This hub is terrible, sure it works fine if you plug a mouse into it or something as rudimentary as that, but plug something that requires data transfer, such as a harddrive or a printer into it and expect failure. It drops printjobs, unmounts harddrives and basically just fails at performing the one task asked of it, to increase the number of viable USB 2.0 ports on your machine. Do not buy this device."
1,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE,"Bought this for my mac. Hooked up, recognized and I was on my way. But fro m there, it was terrible. Devices( Keyboard, Mouse, iPod) Jumping around doing weird things, then disconnecting. Restart of hub would fix problem, then it happened again. Returned the hub and got another, did the same thing. Tried with and without power adapter. Nothing Worked. Not Recommended At All."
4,Great resource for English Teacher,"I was looking for a resource for a new curriculum unit for 8th grade on the Harlem Renaissance, and I wanted super short fiction pieces. I had read many of these pieces years ago. I was so happy to find this."
3,Re-edited music,"I remember buying the LP in 1968 when I saw the movie and feeling a little disappointed because especially in the ""Ecstasy of Gold,"" the music was changed some. I couldn't really understand why but then realized that maybe it was because the movie sounds were also in the movie sound track on the film. I never could figure why the soundtrack was spliced and that is the only reason I could see. This also occurs in several other pieces. Other than that the music is good but would have been better had they left things alone."
5,"'If you're going to shoot, shoot. Don't talk!'","Yeesh, what can i say about this soundtrack? Sure, we all know the main theme from this fantastic spaghetti western. Heck, the uneducated think it's the theme to EVERY western. But there are other tracks that prove Morricone's genius. 'Marcia Without Hope' is one of the more haunting pieces, as anyone from the film can remember. The captured soldiers in the prison camp hum this lovely tune to drown out the cries of one of the prisoners being beaten for information. 'Ecstasy of Gold' is a piece that builds and builds until it's triumph swells the ears of every avid western fan. And 'trio' just screams showdown. This one's a classic!"
5,Some of the most moving music EVER,"Every Track on this Album is superb it says so much with so little yet it is not little at all, it speaks volumesThe heck with Hail to the Chief at the next Presidential eventPut THIS on and the world and the French will get the messageAll kidding aside Enno Morricone has another piece of music to note if you like this you will love ""Orca the killer Whale"" movie soundtrack ( hard to find but worth it!)"
5,Great Game - it's fun!,"I had this game for several years and played it to pass time, and then I lost my dvd for the game. I then searched for the best price and found it here at Amazon and purchased the game."
2,Might be an interesting game,"Despite the fact that the requirements for this game are met by my computer the game will not run. Instead the game boots up and as soon as you attempt to move a character the computer is automatically rebooted. Researching this issue, I found that either the graphics driver had to be updated(which I did) or the monitor resolution must be lowered(which I tried). Neither solution helped, I have not been able to play the game. I assume this will work with a more updated computer so I will wait until I build my next one before knowing whether or not this is a worthwhile game."
4,Overall Fun,"Overall, I found this game to be highly addicting. However, if you play it for too long you start to get bored with it. I appreciate the new ""build anywhere you want to"" ability, but the missions are starting to run together. It seems like the same thing every time I skirmish.I originally favored the Elves but have since moved on to the goblins. Every time I tried to build my city and army, I saw some goblin battalions marching over the nearest hill. This can become incredibly frustrating, especially if you aren't quick to go on the offensive. I usually prefer to build up for a while and then take the enemy all at once, but this game hinders that strategy.Overall, I gave this game a four out of five because it is so addicting and takes you to so many locations that were not covered in the movies, but the quick aggressiveness of the enemy and the brittleness of almost all of the buildings (they seem to just fall apart with every attack) are both annoying."
3,"Good Game, Bad Tech Support","Overall, this is a good game and a vast improvement over the first BFME. The inclusion of the dwarves and elves as races makes the skirmish mode more interesting.There were a couple of things that were disappointments. First of all, I have to say that the graphics, even when set on ultra high were very disappointing and EA made no effort to improve them since the last game. The graphics where blocky and the characters' faces were all blurred out.The largest problem was that if you are using any sort of nVidia graphics card this game usually WON'T even start. When I went through the EA support system they said, ""try rebooting and enter this code."" Needless to say, that didn't work. I then went to nine other third-person forums where I finally found something that I could get it to boot up.Finally, if you save a game it won't be retrievable. I also tried looking on other forums for this but with no joy."
4,Good Game,"This game is very fun to play. The graphics are amazing. But unlike Battle for Middle Earth 1, The campain is very short. It also takes place in the the north of Middle Earth. All of the Big Battles, like the battle for Minas Tirith, in the movie and the book take place in the South. The war of the north is Only said once in the book.But if you're looking for good graphics, this is the place to go. But you need a very powerful computer to run it on the ultra high setting(1gb of ram).All and all, it's a pretty good game."
4,Technical difigulties,"Well, the game downloaded without any trouble. The first two days i played it for several hours. But the next day when I tried to play it, it kept saying the wrong disc was inserted to play. I tried re-installing the game. After it was finished, it let me play again that once. But once I quit the game, the same problem came back. After several days of research i found out it may be the DVD-Rom that may be the issue. After getting some technical support they could not see any problems with the game playing in the Rom. So, later in the week I found out if you shut down your computer for about 30mins each time before playing, the game worked fine. So if you have the same problems as I did, try this and I hope it will help. Over all the game is great. I strongly recommend this game if you have the funds to purchase it. Though i can give no review of the online experience because I have not tried it."
4,cool,"my son really likes this game because he can set it up and then battle, which means he has to think a bit more while playing so mom likes it to."
4,Lord of the rings Battle for middle earth 2,This a great game. You can play it for hours. Lots of battles for sure to play
4,good game but...,"bfme2 is a great game, however, some unrealistic parts of the game almost ruined it for me. such as : when have you ever seen 30 - 40 guys take down a castle made of stone in 30 seconds(with only swords and arrows) ? or 3 heroes take out an entire enemy base(again, with those weapons) ? so for some fun i got the S.E.E. mod. now you have to build siege if you don't want to lose your entire army. you can find it by searching for 'bfme2 special extended edition' on the internet. enjoy!"
4,A Pretty Good Game,"The second BFME is pretty cool. Unlike its counter-part, it takes place in northern Middle Earth. There are all new factions, new environments, and an awesome new feature that allows you to create your own hero. You can be the elves, men of the west (which is a combination of Rohan and Gondor), dwarves, goblins, Isengard, Mordor, and Corrupted men (Easterlings, and Corsairs of Umbar). The goblins are my favorite because they have all these cool monsters like giant spiders, Mountain giants, and fire drakes, which is a sort of flightless fire-breathing dragons. The only problem with this game is that it is too short."
3,Battle for Middle Earth 2,"This game had an amazing concept, or at least I thought it did. However it failed to deliver a truly inspiring vision of the Lord of the Rings universe. As an RTS the game was sub par. Resource management and unit archetypes were generally cookie cutter models, neither horrible nor exceptional. As a representation of the Lord of the Rings universe the game was extremely flawed. Its storied campaigns focused on unimportant characters who in most cases did not do in the books what the game said they did and in general were not vibrant enough to keep my attention. The War of the Ring mode was slightly better but seemed like a cheap knockoff of the conquer the world mode in Rise of Nations or the campaign mode in Dawn of War 40k: Dark Crusade. In general the game was not horrible but it most definitely was not amazing either. I give the Battle for Middle Earth 2 a '3 out of 5'."
2,Perfection undone,"This is a perfect example of DON'T-FIX-WHAT-IS'NT-BROKEN. The original game was perfection and loaded with new ideas and functions. This game takes away all the strategy and makes it into another mainstream rts. The only goal now is to pump out units as fast as you can in order to flatten the enemy instead of having that extra level of capturing building plots. The game is fun for the first 9 or 10 hours, but after that it loses it's appeal. I admit that the hero creator is cool(hence the overall 2 stars), but nothing can heal the disappointment of seeing one of your favorite games massacred in front of your eyes. This game is now worth as much to me as a paperweight and sits on my shelf collecting dust."
4,A good Game,I just bought the collector's edition of the game. I would give it a 4 star overall exept for the fact that it runs a little slow on my computer. In order to play it without lag you need a really good graphics card. But worth buying even at $30-$40. Have fun.
1,DVD Version may not work,"I bought the Collector's Edition. Install went smoothly, game startup got me the message that I needed to enter the game disc. So I verify that I have the game disc, and get the same message. Swap the discs, get the same message.I spent several hours going through the support steps on the website, and the phone support person was kind enough to read where it says deep in the manual that some Sony-brand DVD players will not work. That would have been helpful to know before I bought the DVD version.I am now at the point I don't care how good the game is, I'm not spending another second to make it work. Stay away from the DVD version."
1,Defective Product,This game would effective install or load on my PC. It gave me strange error messages. Too bad because I'm a big LoTR fan.
4,Great game needs a little improvement,"The skirmish mode is way better with new sites to battle in. You have new factions which are the goblins, dwarves and elves. The best part is the create a hero. Where you can create an awesome hero of good or evil. It records their stats and gives them awards. It has new heroes and new units like The mouth of sauron and the mountain giant. The only problem is that the campaign is horrible. You have the elves and dwarves and the goblins. They are both really boring."
2,The original was better in many ways,"First off, the ""strategic"" level war of the ring is total crap. Very simplistic and not very playable. Again, there are two pre-scripted campaigns: good and evil. Those are o.k. but you don't have the option of picking your next battle by moving on a strategic map like in volume I. No real improvements in design or playability, just new races and units. I had expected more.Not recommended."
1,Will not run,Bought two copies for two different computers. We get a game.dat error on both of them. Have appropriate drivers and everything that is needed. Check out the EAForum and see how many others have had this problem. Save your money until they get this problem fixed.
1,Be warned!! May not work by design.,"Although the first game was pretty damn good, be careful buying this one. Apparently for some reason EA has intentionally made this game incompatible with some NVIDIA Geoforce graphics cards even if they meet the memory requirements. Not sure why they did this and don't care either. There was no information about this in the description on Amazon and nothing on the box that I received either. Double check the web to see if it will work with your card."
5,Incredible,"This book confirmed my feeling that David Muench is, for lack of a better description, the Ansel Adams of color photography. I already owned his Appalachian Trail book, ""Uncommon Places"" (I think it's called), but my brother wanted a California-related book for Christmas, so I picked this up, sight unseen. Quite simply, it's breathtaking. The photos span the length and breadth of the state, from Humboldt County's misty redwood stands to the La Jolla coast, to Yosemite and the mountain passes and lakes of the Southern Sierras along the John Muir Trail. There are even a handful of urban photos that make downtown L.A. look quite nice. If ever you doubted that we live in the closest to a natural paradise as there is, take a look at this book, and doubt no more."
3,"It's about the photography, not the state","I ordered this thinking it would show the diversity of California in various aspects, but, being unfamiliar with the work of the photographers, I goofed. This book is all nature photography-- lovely photos, but not too interesting in my opinion. Although California is jam-packed with people, these photos don't include any-- no scenes of teenagers at the beach, no farm workers, no cowboys, no Chinatown markets, no Yosemite climbers. It does show a lot of lovely natural wonders, many of which are enshrouded in mist. So, it's more about photographic technique than about California.My fault-- I should have investigated more thoroughly before purchasing. It wasn't what I hoped for, but if you want beautiful nature shots, this may be the book for you."
2,Very much a letdown...,"I have been a diehard David Gray fan for about 5 years now; I started with the classic White Ladder, and my obsession has grown since then. I have purchased all albums that have come before and since that fabulous CD, although none stand out more than it does. Its been several years since DG has released anything new, and I was so excited when I heard a new album was on the way...until I heard it. I think it is WAY too over-produced, and it is almost a betrayal of the mellow, low-key sound that thousands of DG fans around the world have come to know, love, and depend on for years. By far, I think this album is his worst yet vocally, lyrically, and musically. I hope the classic DG sound I am so familiar with makes a resurgence on his next album. There are a couple songs that are pretty good in and of themselves, such as Aint No Love and The One I Love, and Nos Da Cariad is very beautiful and interesting. As a whole, tho, this album sounds very discordant and mismatched."
1,"I'd buy this, if it weren't for the Copyright protection","I am a HUGE David Grey fan and was really looking forward to purchasing this for not only myself but also for two others on my X-mas list. But after the havoc the Carlos Santana CD created on my computer, there is *no way* I'd do that to myself or my friends. (I didn't even know to look for the copyright protected symbols on a CD case until AFTER I put the Santana CD on my computer/iPod, what a mess. Now, I look every time, at every CD I'm thinking of purchasing) So Sony and David Gray can keep the CD and I'll keep my computer safe.Sony, show some integrity, recall the CD's with copy-right protection and don't put it on future releases"
5,CHILLS,"If this album doesen't touch you, my friend, you are dead.....and most likely buried in a casket of Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson CD's - May God have mercy on your empty soul.If you're already fond of David Gray's music this CD will turn you into a David Gray fanatic. Trust me, I know everything."
1,Can't be put onto on Ipod,"I just recieved this CD from Amazon and immediately put it into my computer so that I could put it on my new Ipod. Well it turns out that this CD is not compatable with Ipod. When you first put it into your computer you have to read and agree with a huge licensing agreement, then it lists all the things that you can and can't do with the CD that you bought and now own but can't do anything with. They will allow you to make up to three copies of it and then it apparently will self destruct like on Mission Impossible. If this is the future of CDs I will have no part of it. I'm returning it tomorrow."
3,Not for Ipods!!!!,"The music is good on this, but with all of this new copyright [dupe], they formatted the disk to not work with Ipods! You can only listen to the music on your comp using the software on the CD. You can;t just simply rip the music. You can rip it using their software, but only in protected WMA format. There is no mention of this on the Amazon site or the CD."
1,"Copy Protected, but NOT rootkit","This disc is protected by Sunncomm, NOT the XCP rootkit. They're two completely different things.If you put this CD into your Windows computer and let it autorun, it will secretely install a driver that prevents you from doing what you want with the CD while it is in your drive.You can get around this by turning off AutoPlay (download TweakUI from microsoft.com), or by holding down the Shift key when you put the disc in your drive (until it finishes initializing). If the driver's already been installed, you can visit bmg.com for removal instructions. If you don't mind its presence, you should still visit bmg.com for an update that corrects a security problem with the driver."
1,LOL not even worth review,"I've been a die hard David Gray fan and waited years for this album. As soon as it was released I got it. First few tracks ok then it takes a nose dive. Some of the tracks are so bad you are left awestruck that David Gray could produce such diabolical quality. I mean the odd track has lyrics that Britney Spears could exceed.I played it 3 times when I got it, and it is so bad that I would quite happy throw it in the trash can. Because he dared put out such rubbish it has put me off playing all his former (and great) albums.Be warned. I thought this 6 months back and only posted the review today, so my opinion is solid on this one. And watch the Sony copyright protection and link to fix it does not open your PC to all kinds of problems (have a Google and you will see it is a danger)."
1,Copy Protected?,"I would love to own this CD, but will not buy it until there is a version that doesn't assume I am a crook, and then install spyware on my computer."
1,copy protected? Why bother,I listened to a few songs that a friend downloaded for free off the Internet. It sounded fantastic. I was going to buy the cd until I saw it was copy protected. I won't buy copy protected cds. It's a shame because the songs are really great and this seems to be an artist I can really get into. Oh well.
1,Copy Protected,"Hey everyone, if you're worried about the copy protection, here's what to do. Just open your favorite bittorrent client and download the mp3's directly. This should eliminate any problems you might have with the copy protection. Thanks!"
1,"Do NOT BUY, the CD is copy protected","I will never again buy a CD from an artist who allows their music to be copy protected. I BUY all my music, but hardly if ever listen to a CD, the first thing I do is rip it to play on my portable mp3 player as well as the mp3 player hooked up to my stereo at home (slimp3). Althought the copy protection can be circumvented, it is just a slap in the face of those who are TRYING to be legal and support the artists. This will only drive me towards finding the music on the internet, instead of buying it!Thanks David Grey!"
1,Copy Protected - Forget Your iPod With This CD,"This CD employs a copy protection method that disallows transfer of tracks to your iPod. If you can't play the tunes on your player of choice, what good is the music?I'd rate this ZERO stars if I could..."
5,WTF are you rating this INCREDIBLE album 1 star?,"You people are incredibly idiotic if you seriously rated this album 1 star for it's label's feeble attempt at copyright protection! What in the hell does that seriously matter?!?! Please, David Gray is an incredible artist and this album is a masterpiece that does not deserve to sit under a sub-par rating only because it has copyright protection up the yin-yang. Seriously, please listen to this fantastic album...to any DG fan out there, forget what all these fools have led you to believe, buy this album as it stands up there with the rest of his catalog."
5,Outstanding,This is a David Gray must have! If you get to see him in concert--Do it! He is amazing. I think this CD really catures and projects his talent. It is one you won't get tired of either!
4,Is it only copy protected in the USA?,"Lots of people say this is a copy protected CD that is released by Sony and won't install on an iPod. It plays on my iPod, in my ancient CD player and the CD says it's from iht Records Ltd. Does the British version not have the copy protection that you're all talking about or have I missed something?Anyway, the album is great."
1,The UK version is not protected,"Just in case it helps, the UK-edition of this album is not copy protected; it's on a 'real' CD!"
5,I think this is David's best album yet!,"I knew immediately upon the first listen that this album wasn't going to leave my sound system anytime soon. The expanded, lush, acoustic producion on this album is a welcome new aspect to David's signature 'sound'; the orchestra sounds gorgeous - as do the horns; David's voice is stronger than ever and he's using his vocal range to excellent effect here.A stunningly powerful album from start to finish."
5,I'm in love with David Gray...,"If anyone can sound hot on their album, it would have to be David Gray. Cadence, gritty tone, deliberate phrasing of each line-- you can really FEEL what he's singing. This album (from what I understand) is heavier instrumentally, and has an orchestral sound. In my opinion, a beautiful accompaniment to Gray's voice, which can stand prefectly stand alone as well. A must buy!!!"
4,Gravedigger,"an epic work of grandeur by the consummate performer who sings circles around most of the others. There is strong songwriting and expert playing by all the musicians involved.As for this ridiculous ""copy-protection"" scheme, couldn't the record company have come up with a better solution that offers more value to the consumer and less restriction over their ability to enjoy the product they have purchased?"
3,Always worth a listen,"My friend introduced me to David Gray a few years back and tried to convince me he was going to be as big as Dave Matthews. While Gray has never achieved that kind of following, he has shown an ability to churn out interesting records with some really nice songs from time to time. The same holds true here. Slow Motion doesn't have any just killer cuts like ""Babylon"" from previous records, but the latest installment includes some nice entries like The One I Love, Lately, Hospital Food and Now and Always..There are some misses here too, but all in all another positive effort. A bit more subdued than previous efforts..hence the title Slow Motion...but try to stick with Gray..he seems to find the mark just often enough to keep a loyal fan base"
4,GOOD CD! Copy protection a PAIN,"Yes, this is a big improvement over his last album - beautiful arrangements this time around, esp ""Now And Always"" If you like David, this is a great piece of work.[...]"
4,Nice and mellow,David Gray has always been a favorite of mine. Very mellow songs but great for work or just relaxing.
3,so-so,"I was expecting more, after reading the glowing reviews. I even listened to snippets here on Amazon before purchasing, but I'm not so impressed. C+"
1,Copy protection stupidity,The music is great. NO question about that. Enough said. However the copy protection will not allow transfer to an IPOD device. Maybe SONY doesn't yet realize that IPODs ( and simliar devices ) are not only the future but also the present. How many people do you see carrying a portable CD player anymore. All this protection software has done is anger a whole lot of people who can listen to a thousand other artists. I enjoy David Grays music very much but will not purchase anymore music CDs which contain software that prevents me from transfering music to an IPOD. Sony's website ( or SUNNCOMM's site ) blame APPLE for this. Who do they think they are kidding.
1,WHITE LADDER FANS WILL HATE THIS CD,"If I ever see David Gray, I'm going to ask him for my $14 back! He owes it to me for slapping together this blob of nothing CD. White Ladder was deep, dark, meaningful, painful, and cathartic. So, of course I couldn't wait for his next CD to come out. This is nothing like what I expected from Gray. Where is the moodiness? Where is the lyrical rain storm? True, most of White Ladder consisted of 6 chords, but the THEME and the FEELING were uniquely his. Life in Slow Motion may be better produced and have a fuller sound, but the entire CD is flat and boring. The only song indicative of Gray's previous performance is Disappearing World. One down... NINE to go. If you are a fan of White Ladder, make sure you get a good listen to this CD before you decide to purchase. And if you know Mr. Gray.... please tell him I want a refund for this coaster he calls ""music"" - I am SO disappointed."
4,David does it for me,"I first heard songs from this Album whilst travelling around the UK and Ireland and was hooked enough to buy it. The standout track (if you like the commercially viable) is The One I Love, but there are several other really good tracks including Slow Motion and Ain't No Love. The latter seems to have shades of Neil Diamond and (towards the end) Chris De Burgh - an interesting mix!Overall this CD is just so easy to listen to that I find myself playing it all the time"
1,"Be careful. This CD has a ""rootkit"" that will mess your PC","DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT play this on a PC. It will install a ""rootkit"" (similar to a virus) on your PC. This is impossible to remove and a backdoor to other viruses. This is a serious security threat to your PC function and your privacy (this software ""phones home"" every time you listen to the cd, reporting your IP address).I would recomment not buying it, if you really like this music, listen to it on the radio instead..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD!,Copy protected CD's place hidden software on your PC. This is not acceptable. Do not buy this CD.
1,Great album but horrible crippled and invasive CD medium,"I bought this CD not being aware of Copy Protection CDs. I wish I had known about it, because I probably would never have bought this CD.In order to listen to this CD on a computer it installs SunnComm's MediaMax DRM copy protection, which I equate to parasitic spy ware or virus ware that severely limits this albums usefulness. SunnComm's only suggested way, to rip and encode the songs for use in a MP3 player, is using the inadequate software provided on CD. In doing so you end up down sampling the audio quality twice (once to wma then again to mp3), resulting in poor sounding music files.I have a collection of hundreds of LEGAL CDs, which I encode into a personal (read not shared) music library to enjoy as I please. I use to pride myself on being an honest musical customer by purchasing each CD, but this copy protection is a slap in the face. I will be sure not to purchase another copy protection CD ever again."
1,copy protection details,"This CD includes copy-protection by SunnComm, as disclosed on the ""compatibility"" label on the back of the CD packaging.If you are using a Windows PC, it will install anti-copying software onto your computer, which will restrict the copies you can make. In particular, this CD will not rip into iTunes (there are workarounds for iPod owners, involving burning an unprotected copy, then ripping that.) For complete details, see <a href=""http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=925"">http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=925</a>.The copy-protection should not affect Macintosh or Linux computers.This is NOT the ""rootkit"" copy protection that Sony is including in some other CDs (that technology is based on the XCP2 system by First 4 Internet).The copy protection is NOT included on the DualDisc version of this album."
1,Copy protection is a pain!!!!,"I really like the song ""The One I Love"" but unfortunately the cd was copy protected. I agreed to having the software driver installation in order to be able to play the song on Windows Media Player. However, the copy protection was not compatible with my SONY CONNECT player or my mp3 player. It was really a horrible problem until I read other reviews to tell me how to get rid of the driver.(...) My advice: Buy the CD if you are computer savy and can understand the above description of how to avoid the problem of the copy protection. Under no circumstance agree to having the evil copy protection software installed on your machine when you put the CD into your machine.... you will regret it!!!!"
2,Too refined,"I have been a David Gray fan for many years.All his previous albums are four or five star rated.But this one is just not up there for me.Its way too refined.I am/was used to his loudish voice,stand out acoustic guitar and the rawness that came with it.Not his best.Songs to look out for are 1.Alibi ;7.Aint No Love;5.Slow Motion.Maybe it will grow on me with time.David Gray albums tend to do that.As of now its still 2 stars..What copy protection are you talking of??"
3,Strong and really showcases Adams' skills,"Bryan Adams is a strong songwriter, singer, musician and entertainer...this album displays him at some of his best and keeps listeners pleased"
5,Cuts like a knife - Bryan Adams CD,Another great person to deal with as far as the seller is concerned. I would buy from them anytime. Thank you.
4,Very good but the best was yet to come !,"This is the album that put Bryan Adams in the path of success. A great pop rock album to listen to.This cd is full of hits, ""The only one"", ""Take me back"", ""This time"", ""Straight from the heart"", ""Cuts like a knife"" and ""The best was yet to come"" are all well known songs. This cd gives us a preview of the following album to come, the multi-hits bomb ""Reckless"". Many artist would be please to get six hits in their career, Bryan got it in a single album and he did it more than one time ! We are very proud of you Bryan !"
3,From Rock To Wimpy,"""straight through the heart"", ""the only one"" and half the other tracks are love songs. the standout track is ""this time"" , ""cuts like a knife"" gets old fast. and a pretty good song called ""let him know"" off par from early adams, this abum starts adams explosive pop career."
4,Grade B+,"This cd is a very good cd, with songs like THIS TIME, STRAIGHT TO THE HEART,& CUTS LIKE A KNIFE, all being top 40 hits. This was the start of Bryans rise as a rock/pop star. There are other good songs on this cd that didn't make the charts, the slow THE BEST WAS YET TO COME & the upbeat TAKE ME BACK, & ONLY ONE. This cd still bears listening to, even today. Bryan's songs, from this time period, always have an upbeat feeling to them."
4,"excellent ,no damage during shipping. thanks",Excellent recording . Somewhat better than the previous versions. for collectors of gold cd's this is a must have.sound quality 7.5 shipping and ordering 9.0
2,an ok early effort from Bryan Adams,"Cuts Like a Knife was Bryan Adams last album before his masterpiece Reckless. Straight from the Heart, and Cuts like a Knife are the hits on this one. The remainder of the album isn't that great, but better than the first two albums he released. The highlights from this one can be found on his greatest hits album."
1,Another dusty forgotten...,"10 Reviews and they're all good? What sort of books have you all been reading? I usually stick with classics, Tolstoy, Bronte, Dostoevsky, and wish I hadn't strayed from the beaten path this time. Someone tell Trace Edwards Zaber to quit posting his own reviews. If you have any standard at all, find something else to read."
5,Well researched Civil War thriller,"Mr. Zaber has crafted a beautiful story of people caught in the agony of fighting their own brothers and kinsman. Set amid the events of America's Civil War, is a love story, a puzzling mystery, a spy story and a true thriller in every aspect of hte word. The writing is inspired and lyrical, concise and authentic in the speech used during that era. Great absorbing story."
2,Revlon Eterna 27,I have used the Revlon Ultima II moisture lotion for years and unfortunately it was discontinued recently. I will miss that product a lot ! I used this Revlon Eterna 27 cream as a hopeful replacement on my face and found that it burned my eyes quite a lot. Do not plan to use it again.
4,"Looks like a fisher-Price toy, but does the job","The Spec's put this thing at 350ft lbs of torque, which is quite a lot more than the competition. I haven't tried torquing a bolt to 350ft lbs and testing it out, but I will say it's spun every bolt and lug nut off everything I've tried it on so far.I can't give it 5 stars, as it's not a 5 star tool, but the value/torque ratio it'll earn 4. It feels cheap, but then again it is. Go figure. For a home garage or occasional use, it's all you need.Spend your money on beer, not overpriced tools."
2,not that powerful,"This impact arrived and was broken in two pieces and covered in oil.Had a nicely rusted set of four sockets too (didn't care,I have plenty of sockets) but the broken in two I wasn't happy about. I gave this two stars because the seller quickly and easily sent a new gun.Even then performance was poor,very short battery life,can't even change one tire before needing four hour charge.Friend was there with a tiny little Dewalt 12v impact DRILL and it seemed stronger and finished the job."
2,The battery stinks.,"I bought this impact tool and was really impressed with the weight and apparent well built appearance. Well, I charged the batteryfor two days and put the tool in the case and in my truck. As luck would have it when I went down to the ranch the ranch truck hada flat tire. I jacked up the truck and pulled out my handy impact tool and PFFFFFFFFFT. The battery was DEAD. I mean the tool wouldnot even turn the socket if I held it. I charged the battery again, for two days, and PFFFFFFFFFFFTT. I have a supposedly good toolbut the battery won't hold a charge more than a couple of days and then PFFFFFFFTT. PFFFFFFFFT translated means &&^%$$&*&%$#$$."
3,Watch the Errors,I have taught computer courses for over ten years and have used all four editions of Computer Confluence. This book has at least a half a dozen errors which I have pointed out to the publisher. None were corrected. I have seen the 5th Edition and the errors are still there. Buyer be ware. If the instructor can point out these errors to the students the book is quite useful. It is not suited to self-paced learning without a qualified instructor.
4,An Excellent Introduction to the World of Computing,"You won't find very in-depth information on any specific subject, but you will find well-written, polished overviews on computing and the many ways computers are used.Both multimedia sources that come with the book: the website and the CD are very helpful. I took a class where this book was the required text and the review quiz that follows every chapter helped my studies."
3,Outdates quickly,This gives recommendations of books that you can read on various theological topics. Any book like this becomes quickly outdated so I would recommend just checking it out at the library.
3,No boos at roo,"3 1/2With Gordon's sit-in the spacey jammers make their Bonnaroo debut a memorable one, if not completely translating to recording."
4,The universe in a Single Atom : The Convergence of Science and Spirituality,A wonderful overview of this topic. Great way to start anyone thinking along these important topics. From here one can explore the many texts and people referenced in the book.
3,A wide point of view,"It is not a scientific book but a book that speaks of science through the eyes and experience of His Holiness. It is interesting though not revealing. It does arise the morality issues regarding the new frontier of genetics but then there are not magic answers. Hoping that the scientific world has a morality compass to guide, or better yet, to constrain the reach of possibilities to the ones that are only beneficial to a wide range of population, or the ones that has no long term negative consequences are in fact the wishes of all of us. Intersting to read? Yes. Scientific? No."
3,Where spirituality & quantum physics meet,Enjoyable. Draws some interesting parallels between Buddhist philosophy and the emerging theories of Quantum Physics. Mind bending in place. Essentially reading for anyone who wants is trying to understand how spirituality and science can peacefully coexist and ever overlap.
5,The Wisdom of the Spirit is the Most Powerful,"The Dalai Lama's wisdom in one book on the whole nature of science, ethics, are as potent as they are profound. A significant questioning from a compassionate heart on the role of higher spirit in the application of science. In a world dominated by out-of-control ego ... this book is a demonstration of why complete freedom from illusion is the only guarantee of inner peace. One of those books to read over and over again. We owe it to ourselves to conquer Mara (illusion). The world and its treasure of riches and power in the misguided context are not real. The Dalai Lama so beautifully explains why."
5,Very excellent,"Gere, though not my favorite actor, does an excellent job of narrating and his presentation was lively and articulate enough without going over-board. Well done.HHDL does what he does, again, and as good as every. He gets to the meat and bones of the issues humbily and simply. He expressed many of the same thoughts and feelings I have had (and which I have been unable to articulate) when I examine current issues in Physics, Biology and Neuroscience with the added bonus of the insight of a highly trained Buddhist mind.There is no fluff, no fuzzy bunnies to be had. Real spirituality working with real science to discover a real ethic and morality for the future."
5,Excelent reading,"Very well written, easy to understand and a well ballanced opinion and explanation on the subject. I would recomend this book to anyone with interest in the subject."
2,too lengthy with too much repeated words,"I am so disappointed with this book! I have read several books on Buddhist and Zen and I loved them. I admire Dalai Lama and bought this book. But this book is poorly organized and written, which I don't think it was the fault of Dalai Lama. If you a a fan of Zen, you would love to see something enlighten while concise and to the point. This book has 236 pages while I think it should be condensed into less than 30 pages. It seems to me the editor and translater lacks the deep understanding of either Buddhist or Zen. By Zen, less is more!"
2,Waterloo Mythology,"One appreciates Weller's enthusiasm and readable style. However, he is a Wellington apologist and an anglophile. As such the reader needs to take his work with a large pinch of salt. Rather than a careful presentation of documented fact, we instead get a repetition of the anglophone mythology of this campaign. This book is not serious history, rather something nearer fiction, as are most British works on the subject. One refreshing exception to that is Hofschroer's two volumes on 1815."
3,Juvenile Sci Fi at its Best,"When I was 11, Andre Norton was my god. I think I read every Norton book in the Beaumont Public Library. I remember how shocked I was when I learned ""Andre"" was a SHE! Somehow the books were never the same...I had identified so strongly with all those youthful male heroes, to learn that they sprang from the female imagination was a little unnerving to my adolescently male mind.The time travel books were awesome...Galactic Derelict, The Time Traders, Key Out of Time, all ranged wildly into strange alien technologies and vistas, and there was plenty of danger and suspense. I'm a little sad to learn that so much of Norton's ouvre is out of print.If you catch this somewhere, pick it up.Oh, and by the way, it wasn't an original 1979 edition as mentioned in another review here, the original was written in 1959."
3,Good mouse bad scroll,"I enjoy this mouse. The control is excellent but I do not like the feel of the scroll wheel. It does not feel smooth and is rather jerky in its movements. I like the mouse, but this feature lowers my ratings."
3,Decent Mouse,"I got this mouse on sale thinking less than $[...] for a razer product is a steal. When I got it and pulled it out of the packaging I admired its design. When I put it in my hand I couldnt beleive how uncomfortable it was. Each side has like a plastic grip that just isnt comfortable and as far as a grip goes is very slippery. After some use I got used to the grip and didnt mind it as much. As a mouse it works well. Its very responsive and the buttons click very well. After about a year of use the scroll wheeled stopped working properly so I have since stopped using it. I am now using a basic dell optical mouse and find it just as good if not better than the razer in terms of comfort and precision. Granted the dell mouse is a new model and the razer is 5 years old.Also I'd like to mention the red glow on the mouse is always on, which can be a problem if you keep your pc on all night and are annoyed by constant light. I found myself covering the mouse up anytime I left my pc on overnight."
2,Disapointed,"I loved Bob Greene's book and find his sensible approach to fitness and diet work well for me. But I was disapointed in this purchase. The exercise bands seemed very short and hard to use. There was not enough information included with the bands. One exercise has you step on the middle of the bands and hold an end in each hand, then raise your arms. Well, I am nearly 6' tall and I felt like I was going to snap the bands. I literally could not lift them high enough to do the exercise. I also could not find a number to call to ask about the problems I was having. I emailed the company that manufactures the bands, but they never responded. So, the bands remain unused and I have moved on to free weights. I feel like it was a waste of money."
3,Copper Tulip Rain Chain,"Work is still being done on the outside of the house so the Rain Chain has not been installed yet. However, they look beautiful and I can hardly wait for them to be installed. The Rain Chain will funnel water into rain collection barrels. Delivery was very quick."
3,"5 Star look, 2 Star performance.....","Once again Amazon shipping exceeded my expectations, the rain chains arrived earlier than I had originally thought.Fairly good packaging. The chains arrived in a plastic ""sock"" to minimize scratching during shipment.Very easy to adjust the length and to install. They have been up for 6 weeks and the patina process is beginning to take place.They look great, many compliments, just do not expect them to handle more than a light rain, because once it starts to come down, the spray is significant."
2,A disappointment,"The only good thing I can say about this is it was pretty when we first hung it. But we soon discovered it was not at all practical as even the smallest amount of rain quickly filled the splash pan at the bottom with no way to direct the rain run-off. Then, instead of turning green as you would expect from copper, it merely turned a dull gray brown. And I would definitely not recommend it for a PA winter. The first time the water in it froze, it broke into pieces."
5,looks great,I love the rain chain because of the elegance that it brings to the house rather than the old spouts.
2,Spare yourself,"The book is incredibly slow getting to anything resembling a plot and, when it does, it's nearly total information dump in one chapter. The whole love-interest-thing is awkward and distracting from the story (I kept thinking ""Jerry McGuire""). The idea for the book sounds interesting but it's poorly developed. I lost interest after chapter 16."
5,Just take a look inside this book.,"Within this book are some of the most exciting macro-photographs I have ever seen. Whilst the image on the front cover is an exceptionally fine picture of a pair of Butterflies, it is not a photograph which grabs the imagination and just might make the prospective purchaser move on to the next book without bothering to take a look inside. Yet inside are all the patterns, colours, textures and forms of the smallest detail within nature photography and anyone could so easily have picked a more vibrant cover shot. That, however, is the one and only criticism I have for this book and is ""not"" enough to lose any stars.This is an exceptionally fine work with details of exactly how to go about taking macro photographs in nature. All the equipment and all the techniques are there - so pick it up, read and learn, and your photography ""will"" improve.NM"
2,Pretty skin but not that great,"My daughter loves this skin but it does not stay on completely. The top sticker is the worst, constantly coming off. The inside stickers stay great and the bottom one is ok too. The skin is thicker than all the other skins I've seen, maybe that's the reason it doesn't stick easily. Over all my daughter does not complain so it's ok."
2,Smokin Aces is smoldering beneath the ruins,"Why is it that most directors these days have to speed up a movie like a video game.The difference is its cheaper to play the game.There's alot of talking through out,mostly profanity laced.How come killers know where Jeremy Piven is but the FBI has no clue.This is scary stuff folks! I feel safer don't you?!?Not until the last half blood is spilled everywhere.Chainsaws were thrown in for good measures.This is what a million dollar contract brings?!?Oh and that little Japanese boy with the karate moves on our friend who lost his fingers.I'm surprised he didn't put a cap in him just to get rid of that pest.Ben Affleck gets knocked out early as well as Peter Berg,Its a pity considering they were interesting characters.My favorite two were Alicia Keys and her partner with the big gun.Although other reviewers thought highly of this one I felt that it was nothing more that a Pulp Fiction overkill!"
1,what are you doing ari gold?????,"I agree with the previous guy, but differ a little bit. the person who edited this movie must have gotten the dumbest clips from the worst movies ever made and then spliced them together. i mean, it's terrible. you know there's something terrible like a pile of cr*p, and that terrible has a stentch? well, this movie is like the stentch from that terrible.On a side note, Common, the rapper, was pretty awesome. Although his role was really small.Movie still sucked so much."
2,NO HAPPY,"I was so happy when I received my movie and when I started watching the movie all of a sudden the movie started to freeze, I'm not sure that about."
2,Overrated,"It LOOKED really good, the previews were good, the actors are good, the story was good, but the movie sucked. HUGE letdown. Can't even really pinpoint the reason. It just wasn't good."
3,If you like your novels graphic,"I had thought that this was a Terrentino film and was reluctant to watch it. As it got going I was surprised ad how coherent it remained even if a bit convoluted and silly.The plot seemed like something out of the ""underground"" comic books of the seventies, today they are of course called graphic novels. So, here is the deal, this is not a well written engrossing story, but it is a bit of mindless fun for those not offended by, well anything, because it has about every offensive thing you could find without an NC17 rating."
2,neverending confusion,"Smokin' Aces is basically a pretty-looking low budget film. The storyline is about as unorganized and confusing as it gets, because the entire first half of the film is nothing but one nonsense barely-understandable segment after another, while the second half is a small improvement with lots of violence, gun shootings and blood to bring the viewers back from their sleeping state.Looking back however, it's just a failed attempt at an action movie that tries *so hard* to be entertaining, but the constant shifting around from one segment to another makes it almost impossible to enjoy on any level. Maybe it has some funny segments (such as the kung fu fighter striking near a guys face, and another segment involving a guy playing with a dead guys face) but overall, these funny segments just make it harder to take the action parts seriously, and it wasn't good enough of a movie overall to take seriously in the first place. Just don't even waste your time."
3,Fun Movie,Saw part of this on cable but it is better on DVD . Almost as good as Snatch for surprises.
2,Too violent,I did not care for this movie at all. I like Ben Affleck. I didn't like the story line or all the crazy violence.
3,Action packed,Interesting plot. Great cast. Kept me in the edgeOf my seat. Some comedy as well. Alicia keys is a star!Suprise ending!
4,Better than expected,"Surprising, refreshing and had a much deeper plot line than I imagined it would. Give it a look, you may be surprised too."
2,It's not an ace. It's a joker.,"The cover of the DVD case is colorful and eye-catching. The movie was beautifully filmed. The actions scenes are fast, furious and bloody. The story is nothing. It's just an excuse to make a movie! If you like comics books, you might like this movie because the story does not have to make sense! This clearly shows a picture with great casts does not guarantee to be an interesting movie.It's worth watching once."
4,Good movie with rich characters and plenty of action,"Buddy ""Aces"" Israel a Las Vegas performer turned wana be gangster starts pulling moves on the street. His actions divide the last Mafia family and make him the most valuable snitch there is. The word is out that he is working a deal to turn states evidence and the Mob has put a 1 million dollar bounty on his head with a special requirement attached.This movie was very entertaining with some of the most interesting characters I've seen in a while whether it be Jason Bateman as Rip Reed or the Tremor brothers. All the characters you encounter seemed unique.The Good: As stated some of the best characters I've seen in a while. Plenty of action and cools weapons (.50 caliber was awesome) and some laughs as well. The pace of the movie was very fast and things are constantly developing and happening.The Bad: Nothing memorable, just make sure you keep up with the plot.Overall: A highly entertaining movie that is definitely worth checking out."
3,Action film for the sake of action,"This movie is an action movie specifically for people who want to sit down, and pretend the plot is deep. This film trys to act as though the plot is more deep and interesting than it actually is which I found bothersome but not a deal breaker. A good film to watch is you want to see people shooting at eachother and going, ""is that guy bad guy A, B or C?"". Not a bad film, but I expected more from it. More worth renting than buying, unless you know you're into that sort of thing. If you really want an bad*** action movie try Crank or 300."
4,Smokin' Aces Blu Ray Review,Picture quality is very good although very stylised (blown-out contrast and lurid colours) though I'm sure that's exactly how it was intended by the director. Sound is great (go the .50 cal.!). Very happy with the purchase. 8/10
4,Blu-ray took long enough,"I've been waiting months for this to come out on blu-ray before buying it. Too many good actors to list; Jeremy Piven, Ryan Reynolds, and Ben Afleck all display the best acting of their careers. Plenty of violence of the assassin variety, don't count on too many people living until the end."
4,Smokin' Aces,"Mob boss Primo Sparazza has taken out a hefty contract on Buddy ""Aces"" Israel--a sleazy magician who has agreed to turn state's evidence against the Vegas mob. The FBI, sensing a chance to use this small-time con to bring down big-target Sparazza, places Aces into protective custody-under the supervision of two agents dispatched to Aces' Lake Tahoe hideout. When word of the price on Aces' head spreads into the community of ex-cons and cons-to-be, it entices bounty hunters, thugs-for-hire, deadly vixens and double-crossing mobsters to join in the hunt. With all eyes on Tahoe, this rogues' gallery collides in a comic race to hit the jackpot and rub out Aces. Smokin' Aces has humor and flash, and there's always something going on."
1,Ben Affleck school of sh*tty acting,"Don't waste your time or money on this movie made to make musicians appear talented and talented actors appear stupid (Ray Liotta) I'm surprised that Ray took a look at this script and instead of wiping his[..]with it he was apart of the flic. Also, that cute girl from Hustle n Flow was superb in that movie, only to be an unconvincing, over-energetic lesbian with the hots for big thighed Alicia Keyes. Not buying it. There's no talent in this movie, all the good actors suck, all the musicians suck worse. If this post had negative stars, I would've given that."
4,-=Insert WittyTitle Here=-,"I don't have to tell you about this film because you saw it already. What; really? You didn't see in theaters? For shame!Smoking aces is over the top action, like a poorly written, themeless Natural Born Killers, or TV's ""24"" meets DIE HARD II.Either way, if you hate Michael Bay but love Guns, Explosions, Senseless violence, And Humor of the Black, Slapstick, and Stupid variety, you'll enjoy. If you've seen The Good Shepard, then kick back and numb your brain to Smokin' Aces. You deserve it."
2,Still R rated? = Avoid,"Universal have yet again dropped the ball here. It's all good and well releasing Smokin aces 2 in R and Unrated form, but how about the infinitely superior original? It suffered heavy cuts at the hands of the studio and the MPAA. Get with the programme Uni, this R rated edition is not worth the upgrade to HD unless you're a slavish fan in need of sharper sound & image quality."
2,Something To Watch. . .,". . .To pass away the time while Easter dinner was still being prepared. Other than that, I never would've watched this movie. It seemed to be the end result of a copy/past job and it made no sense. I thought it was pretty awful and I couldn't believe Ben Affleck would star in something like ""Smokin' Aces"". At least his character died off in the beginning. Alicia Keys is beautiful, but her acting was horrendous. She used the same expressionless face and the same flat, raspy, expressionless voice throughout the entire movie. She was as interesting as a piece of cardboard with a wig on top of it. Common did a little bit better and he should definetly consider a career in acting. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they were really bored."
1,A really bad movie,"This is one of the worse movies I've seen in my life, to the point of making me leave the theater after its first thirty or so boring minutes.Anyone who's able to watch it entirely, should be rewarded for being really patient."
3,Not worth the time,"I never thought I'd say this but too much action not enough story. Movie was ""shooting"" for a dark comedy but was hard to stay interested in. It was like watching 2 hours of trailers from similar movies. The movie was edited poorly I suppose. There were some cool little snapshots that stay in your mind but overall it was a waste of $16."
2,Mostly a waste of time,"I'm all for the auteurist theory in filmmaking. Joe Carnahan's Narc was a very successful film, full of intensity and bravado, and established him as a director of distict vision and energy.But this is a messy, ultimately stupid, fundamentally meaningless action-popcorn-slick kill-fest, whose only positive feature is a handful of engaging performances (Joel Edgerton as Hugo Croop, Chris Pine as Darwin Tremor, Jason Bateman as 'Rip' Reed stand out) and a great looking closing credit sequence.This film seemed like something for all involved to do on the way to making films that can be entertaining, enlightening or both.Half way through this I knew I didn't care, and at the end I didn't care."
3,Man,"I really wanted this to be good. You look at the list of characters that star in this and you figure it has got to be good. I was hoping for a semi serious picture with a great story like Ocean's Eleven(the remake). Instead this was more of a Hong Kong over the top action film with buckets of bloody killings. I don't mind pictures like that, but the box said drama comedy. I'm not sure where the comedy was in the movie. The acting is fine, and there certainly was some offbeat characters. Unfortunately everything has a ton of promise, but very little hits the mark. This was decent to watch and entertaining, but I wasn't blown away like I would have hoped. Certainly worth renting, and probably a buy for a lot of people. I would watch it first rather than making a blind buy."
3,Mediocre,"This was an interesting and stylized film with an original plot and a few good characters; but it dies the death because of a really forced and incredulous ending--not that the film itself was any more believable, but at least it was palatable. The resolution killed this one for me so I won't even labor over the plot. See it if you want, don't see it . . . who cares. . . ."
3,Smokin Aces Blue-ray,"I liked the movie, buy many have said it was far too violent, including some of my friends.KenWebmaster[...]"
2,"Funny concept, terrible execution",This was a funny comedy - ruthless hitmen racing to the target before someone else gets him first. Unfotunately you need more than gratutious violence and absurdly outlandish characters to make comedy.
2,this hd-dvd doesn't work with xbox hd-dvd?,I exchanged item thinking it was defective disc but new one wouldn't work either. The movie is good but I had to watch the plain dvd side. My other hd-dvd's still work in my xbox.
4,Ben gets smoked and its awesome,"Ben Affleck catches some machine gun bullets early in this fun film, and it is awesome. Ben's roll is very very small, but he does set the table well. Fun, fast paced and little massive firepower always makes a movie a little more enjoyable. Good to watch with the guys, or a for night."
2,Steamin' Deuces,"How many mediocre takes on genre clichés and half-hearted performances of a ridiculous piecemeal script can you pack into an hour and a half? What sort of mess would result from an uninspired pastiche of the hooks of Ritchie, Tarantino, and Ocean's Thirteen, a hopeless attempt to borrow together the coolest movie evar? Smokin' Aces has the answers. Some times it seems like a poorly executed rip-off, other times like a poorly executed parody.Things explode fairly nicely, in general, though also implausibly. Sadly, Ryan Reynolds' head does not."
4,dont listen to bad reviews,"if u like good acting...crazy in the head action, not action like lethal weapon action but litteraly crazy in the head action where the camera is all jacked up...a fantastic soundtrack and did i mention brilliant acting by jeremy piven? then u should watch this movie."
2,Waste of my time and money,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was a much better film.Ben Affleck died like in the first twenty minutes."
2,"ok ... er, yeah ...","Well, this was an acceptable waste of two hours. The new caper flick with all the Guy Ritchie cliché freeze frames and the endless countdown of character's who's fates become intertwined. I think my favorite part was when Ben Afflect died ... but, hey, that's just me. Oh, and ""a straight-to-DVD prequel has been announced"" according to wikipedia, so ... there's something."
3,Huh?,It starts out the way you would expect with lots of action but at the end they try to explain themselves. Huh? If you like action with a lot of crazy characters then this is for you. Don't try to make sense of it.
5,Smokin Aces,My Oppinion: This movie was awesome. A Must SeeAbout The Movie: This movie is about a illusionist who give away mob secrets and the mob has a 1 million dollar hit out on him and a lot of ruthless killers tries to get to him before one another.
4,Where there's smoke there's usually fire...usually,"Smokin Aces is a good action movie for those people that like action movies. It's funny, smart, and packed with good scenes that make it worth watching. There are enough twists and there is enough violence to liken it to other similar movies like Snatch, Ronin, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and I enjoyed it. The HD-DVD combo worked well in my 360 HD-DVD player and showed marked improvement. I would recommend this to the action movie fan easily as well as anyone looking for a good HD-DVD to add to their collection."
3,decent movie,"this was a cool assasin movie but,i just fail in love with georgia sykes (alica keys) and her sexy body!especially when she had to change her clothes in the hotel to do the hit........ i was like wow! i wish i could hit the rewind button in the movies!"
3,May the Best Hitman Win!!,"This is a fast paced action flick with many twists and turns. Mainly, you have the main character of Buddy Israel, a Las Vegas headliner and member of the mob, willing to give evidence against the mob to the FBI. The mob gets wind of this and wants him dead. So, a plethora of hitmen are hired to kill Buddy Israel and so it becomes a race to see who can kill him first.Although, there are some funny/odd characters, interesting twists and turns throughout this film, and non-stop action.... I must say that this was also this film's downfall. There was too much action and too many twists and turns in this movie, that it was difficult to follow the movie at times. And although the ending of the movie had a big plot twist (which was good), there was also an unrealistic part of the ending that was disappointing as well."
3,Fast paced action movie!!!,"I enjoyed this movie. There were so many recognizable actors in it, not just for space either. I'd recommend this film. However if you're against gratuitious violence and all of that other mayhem, then this movie probably won't be your cup of tea. I just took this movie for what it was...entertainment."
4,Jump in and Fasten Your Seat Belt,"Pleasant and very violent movie and to that extent I liked it better than I expected. You have to pay attention as to who is the good guys and who is the Bad Guys and the Movie is very good at that.Extremely Violent and certainly not a kids movie.You got the Mob, Revenge , FBI, Bad Guys/Good Guys as it jumps all over in who is shot or stabbed or other next. Somehow it stays in Fabric which is real surprising with so much activity and themes. Well done."
3,Packin and Stackin,"This movie is about body bags, lots of em. If you like your movies full of bad guys and gals spouting gangsta rhetoric and cursing one another this may be your brew. Only one problem, it really didn't offer much that everyone hasn't seen in a half dozen other movies. Fans of movies like ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Alpha Dog"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Snatch"", ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", ""Desperado"", ""Oceans Eleven"", and a half dozen others have already seen this movie. This niche is getting hard to fill with something new and different. So although there is good acting, effects, and lots of action, you won't be surprised about where it starts or it takes you."
4,Entertaining and satisfying.,"This movie was entertaining from the start to the end. I enjoyed finally seeing Ryan Reynolds have a serious role in a movie, and I personally think he did quite a good job. Ray Liotta didn't really have much to work off of and I never really liked him in the first place. The plot is very cliche, but I think Carnahan did a good job with it. Some say that there's a lack of transition in between the two different styles the movie alternates between (crazed out action scenes or parts that actually move the plot of the movie forward), but I didn't really notice it. If I had to relate this to another movie I would say Lucky Number Slevin. LNS is a better movie imo, but the way they story is drawn out is similar if the flashback in LNS is removed. I was sort of disappointed with part of the outcome of the story, seemed anticlimactic but that's all up to opinion. Overall, I was satisfied and this review was pretty useless."
1,DO NOT USE FOR MICE,"Box states it's suitable for mice:My husband bought this cage and brought it home for our full-grown male mouse. We had to seperate him quickly from the momma once she gave birth. This cage is smaller than I am comfortable with, but I thought it would serve its purpose. I thought wrong.I've been woken up and yelled to when Cocoa (the mouse) gets out of the wires on the top of the cage. He's a super friendly and mild tempered mouse, so he's not even an exception in that department. This cage just flat out doesn't contain a mouse of even full-grown size. Thankfully Cocoa just sits there on top of his cage usually once out, but I finally gave up on this one since we have a cat in the house and this just isn't safe at all!!!"
1,Hard to handle flavor,"I never had a chance to see if these worked, I couldn't handle the flavor of the lozenges for even a minute before I had to spit them out. I tried to have one twice. If you do not have an easy gag reflex they may work out for you. As for me, the flavor and texture had me so distracted, by the time I'd spit it out I'd already forgotten about my craving. I ended up quitting still w/o lozenges or gum."
4,Basilisk Attack Playset,"The toy is discribed as ""Harry Potter Basilisk Playset"". The only problem is that there is no Harry Potter that comes with the playset! In order to fight the Basilisk you need Harry Potter with his sword! The box has a very attactive picture of Harry Potter fighting the Basilisk; but in small print it says action figure must be purchased separately. The web site does not say ""action figures must be purchased separately"". ... By the way, read the small print, not all the action figures shown on the box go with the Basilisk Attack Playset, nor do they tell you which ones do! Youre left to figure out that yourself. ..."
3,Ok so where is the fun??,"My son wanted this so bad for xmas that it made the Santa list...we got it for him, but when he opened it xmas morning, all it does is hiss, you have to hold him forcebly with one hand while you push down his tail so his mouth will open. Then the only way to ""kill"" him is to touch a small lever in his mouth, or you can whap him with harrys sword (harry does not come with this, so make sure you have one..and not all figures hold the sword that comes with this, the sword that comes with the harry figure with the sword is to small..) after whapping him with the sword, he is supposed to fall over ..and turn off..meaning he died...ok...so is that fun?? i would have to say the coolest thing is the background..i wish the toy maker would make a castle play set for the larger figures..along the lines of a barbie house for boys! All in all the basillas is ok, a glorified and expensive action figure..."
3,Hmmm...,"You NEED other figures to make this fun. It should just be labeled as a serpent because it is not truly a ""playset"" on it's own. My son had it on his Christmas list but was not happy with it and lost interest soon after opening it."
3,"If you grew up in the Bay Area, it's not bad.","I'll admit it. I bought the book because of the cool cover art. A guy passed out, head down with 40-ounce in hand appealed to me in a low-down romantic kinda way. Sorta like bukowski waxing poetic after his 18th beer. I was also intrigued by the setting. Much of it takes place in my home town, SF. The writing is a bit unpolished, but that's part of the charm. It jibes with the content in a good way. In short, if you're from the Bay Area and started your drinking days with Mickey's and O-E purchased illegally from immigrant convenient store owners, this is the book for you."
5,The Beach Boys' second Capitol album,"Here is the Beach Boys' second Capitol album,at least in America. The original catalog number for the stereo LP copies is ST 1890. Mono copies bore only a T. On this album,David Marks filled in for bass guitarist Alan Jardine. I don't know why Jardine did not participate in recording this album,but he would continue being a Beach Boy for subesequent albums. Great songs from this 1963 release include the #1 title track,SHUT DOWN,LANA,FARMER'S DAUGHTER,the instrumental MISIRLOU,HONKY TONK which also is instrumental and FINDERS KEEPERS. Teenage girls were in love with these guys in 1963 just like British teenage girls were in love with the Beatles,who were the Beach Boys' Capitol Records labelmates."
2,Get the 2-fer instead!,"Once again, Capitol released all of these Beach Boys albums in 2-for-1 editions in stereo with bonus tracks. After a long disappearance, they're back as imports here. Get them while they're hot! This, the Beach Boys' 2nd album, is paired on the 2-fer with their first album ""Surfin' Safari."" You'll be much more satisfied with that edition. Plus you'll get the stereo version unlike this mono version. Get the better one and forget this Japanese CD!"
5,Thinking Outside the Block: Step by Step to Dynamic Quilts,The book was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely fashion.
1,Extremely Disappointing,I'm a traditional quilter in the mood to try something new. This isn't it. It's one technique done over and over. The quilts mostly looked alike. I don't have any desire to do any of them or anything like.
5,a little juice for anyone looking for a re-charge!,"The previous reviewer who stated that this is ""one technique done over and over"" clearly only looked at one PAGE of this book. There are at least SIX distinct techniques, along with multiple gallery examples for each, ideas for combining trad blocks with unique ""transitions"", beautiful color photos, an ending section on combining leftovers and layered throughout is a wonderful narrative of design basics and creative encouragement! Quilters who like watercolor quilts should check out the Garden Lattice technique - stunning! And the Irregular Checkerboards will appeal to Nancy Crow fans. There are art quilts, baby quilts, pictorial quilts - my personal favorite is Searching for the Light by Marilyn Felber. This book will be a boost to anyone's creatvity and imagination (providing you have some to begin with!)."
5,Had to have it!,"I have bought 15 quilt books for my wife. When I saw this one, I asked her to get it for ME. I've designed a quilt using the design overlap method in Ruth MacDowell's book ""Patterns"". This book gives me six new methods for creating quilt designs. These techniques are considerably more versatile than Ricky Tims' Convergence Quilts. Besides I like the quilts in the book. My wife, an experienced quilter, agrees. But, ""concerning taste, there can be no dispute"", so look before you buy."
3,Just OK,"This is just a notch above stack and whack. I was expecting more art and less craft. Many of the shown examples are repetative so you feel like you are reading the same exact method over and over again with a slight twist. I expected many different art quilting techniques, not the small unimaginative handful that is illustrated in this book.This book doesn't elevate the craft of quilting into the realm of art. Even the sample gallery pictures are much more folksy-crafty then the wow I associate with art quilts. Overall, I was disappointed with a book that I had high hopes for."
5,More than just a beginner's book,"I read the other posts and I really agree with the reviewers who say this book is great for beginners. It walks you step by step through every feature and function, with cool full-color illustrations. It takes the fear out of a fairly intimidating program. I learned an amazing amount about the program in less than an hour. The book shows you all of the special effects for audio and video, as well as all of the transitions in a way that's easy to understand. It also shows you how to use all of the panels, which initially I found really confusing. The book is the perfect primer to help you get started with this software. Adobe should hire Plumer to write their books. It actually makes using the software seem fun!"
3,Much screenshots - little words,"Easy Adobe Premiere Elements 2 (Easy)... Too easy i think. Bought this book for my birthday, but was expecting smth more. 90% of book are screenshots - click there and there and you'll get this. Not very professional - almost no explanations... Think almost the same stuff you find in Adobe ""classroon in a book"", but there more explanations.Have very double meaning about this book, but for people who already have any normal experience with Premiere or Premiere Elements i would not recommend this book - try to find smth more intresting."
4,Just Great,"I've listened to the cd several times trying to figure out how they managed to record this concert so well but I just couldn't!!! Really, it's great... from the first song to the last one... trust me, the cd's worth the bucks... the bands are great, their songs are great, too... it's just great!!!"
2,"Costume requires some ""assembly""","Pulling the ribbon through the front of the costume does not prove to be easy. I finally figured out after fraying it repeatedly, to wrap tape around it similar to shoe laces. Wings were also difficult to 'wire'. Still a cute costume, just not real smart for those in a hurry."
5,The best book for maternity,"I dare to qualify this book as excelent since have read a lot on the subject while I was pregnant and this one gave me the best guide-lines for what to expect during the pregnancy and in the delivery process. Any fear or uncertainty disappears when one goes though the comprehensive and informative text. And at the same time the pithy style keeps your attention without making you feel tired of the specific language. The terminology is very well explained so that a woman starts to feel like an active part of the medical team that assists the parturition not like some ignorant in front of them (if by chance this is your concern as it was for me). But what I liked the most about this book is the love to the Mom and her baby it is written with. It's amazing how Laurence Pernoud makes you feel like there is one more person out there who carres about you. With my respect to the very popular american author Dr. B.Spock, I sincerely recommend Laurence's books."
5,Cadillac History,Outstanding hard bound book expertly written with great pictures and illustration. A treasure for the collector and an outstanding purchase.
4,A Quick Trip to London,"Originally, I read about this series in National Geographic Travel. I bought the London book as a gift for a seven year old who is a certified Harry Potter fan and, as a result, becoming quite the junior anglophile. While this may not be an up-to-date trip to London (some of the landmarks mentioned are no longer there), it sparks the imagination and whets the young traveler's appetite. The illustrations are fun and it doesn't stay on the shelf long at our house."
5,beautiful,"Exclamations come to mind: beautiful design and drawings, comprehensive and to the point guide! And this goes for all his city guides Paris, Rome, Venice and Hong Kong. You might argue it is a bit old fashioned, but I think you are confusing it with ""it s one of the Classics"". And when something is called a Classic, it is timeless and a Must-Have! Trust me, it is worth your while and money!"
5,"This is London, indeed!","I first saw this book while visiting London, England. It cost something like '20 pounds. I decided I'd wait til I got home and order it off of Amazon instead. Glad I did - it was far less expensive. It is also a great book. Miroslav Sasek's books on different locations across the globe are great - fun art, informative and a nice sense of humor as well. A little outdated but the new editions tell you what has changed in the city since the original publication. I have actually been collecting this series of books for every location I have been to (if there is a Sasek book out there for it - and so far there seems to be!)."
3,Comments on This is London by Miroslav Sasek,"One of my favourite artists. I have most of the series now, however, I was very let down with the quality and colour of the editions I have received from Amazon - the colours are dull, printed on dull paper. I have an edition of ""This is San Francisco"" which I purchased many years ago, printed in Germany, and the colours are clear and bright - the books I received from Amazon, printed in China are disappointing."
2,Beware! These are used books!,"This is a great book for children. However, when I put this on my daughter's wish I thought that it was a new book. Not so. There is nothing in the description that says it's used. The book received is a used library book with stamps all over it. It was delivered badly wrapped as well.So, if you're looking for a new book, this seller doesn't provide. However, if you are looking for a book on London (or any other European city for that matter) that's written for children, you might want to buy anyway. They aren't easy to find."
2,This is London,"I thought this was a legitimate book on London, i.e., Foders, but it was a childrens book. Be careful not to make the same mistake."
3,Just OK,"I like the concept - but the blade wants to tilt funny sometimes, and I have to adjust it back before it will work. Also, It doesn't have an ""eye"" remover for potatoes. I think I would have done better getting the slightly larger version with the blade at a angle....."
2,disposable,I like the idea of a blade that stays sharp... but this particular peeler is made poorly. The handle is plastic. the blade holder is so thin it will likely snap off within a few months. Very flimsy plastic blade holder. The peeler is very sharp... BUT does a better job peeling items like squash. Thin skin items like apple are more easily peeled with a zyluss peeler.
3,Consise but not that helpful,"This book seems to closely follow Ackerman's Surgical Pathology by Rosai, and it does a an admittedly good job of condensing the material down as much as possible. It very much appears that the author has published his personal notes from his studying for the AP boards. I really don't know how helpful this would be to someone else. The material is very dense (as many outlines of technical information must be), and you probably can go back and read your highlights of Rosai in the same time it would take to try to comprehend the material from this outline. The one exception is the appendix on Syndromes and Bodies that I thought was unique. Everyone studies differently, and there are many surgical pathology study aids out there. This one wasn't nearly as useful to me as the Pathology Pearls of Wisdom or ""Osler"" notes."
4,"Excellent for the layman, angler & researcher","This is a superb book. I am a fly fisherman, and Caddisflies provides a comprehensive overview of a fascinating insect family (although to be clear, this is not a fishing book). The book is written to be understood by a wider audience than just naturalists, and the illustrations are superb."
5,Classic color,"I love this long-lasting eye color. It's been my eyelid base color for the past 3 years, and I hope for many more."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Planning a trip to Niagara Falls in the fall, I thought this $6 'book' may give me some information I couldn't easily find elsewhere. Tips on where to stay, where not to stay, places to avoid, hints on how to get around, etc. As it turns out, the 'inside scoop from experienced travelers' is a hodgepodge of reviews from everyday tourists. I don't need to pay $6 for 13 pages of reviews that I can find for free on any number of travel websites, and certainly don't have to pay $6 for reviews of the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood. Some of the write-ups on attractions and local restaurants are ok, but again, nothing I didn't find on other free sites. And only 2 reviews of hotels out of the dozens in the area. That's what I was really hoping for before plunking down $200+ per night. Save you money and use your favorite search engine on the net."
3,Diary of a Mad Screenwriter,"This book can be described by that old chestnut: ""breezy."" It's a diary of David Sherwin's 35 years in the screenwriting business (If..., O, Lucky Man, and Britannia Hospital) and as all diaries, it seems that it was harder to edit than to write and luckily, even easier to read.If you're involved in the creative process (and who isn't now-a- days) you'll probably enjoy reading how tough it is to make a living in the film business, especially if you're manic-depressive, alcoholic, difficult to work with, and insist on living in the UK when the big money is in Los AngelesAdd an extra two stars if you worship Lindsay Anderson."
4,Really useful,"I bought this before I moved to the city from the West Coast, and I'm really happy with it. It's easy to navigate, and small enough to carry around in a purse. Obviously it only covers Manhattan; I wish it had some coverage of the outer boroughs but maybe there's another book for that. The only minus is that the maps don't show subway entrances/exits, which I think would be very useful. Overall, very very happy."
5,The only map you need in NYC,"I have used the Manhattan Block by Block guides for years and they are the absolute best if you want to get around in NYC by something other than cab. If you drive or prefer mass transit, or if you have multiple clients in Manhattan, or if you are touring NYC - buy this book. This is ALWAYS in my purse - and you may catch me using it if you visit Manhattan.6/28/2010: Wait for a new edition if you are using this for MTA (Metropolitian Transit Authority) info on buses and subways. A number of lines were combined or eliminated in order to cut back on costs."
3,Not as good as Guide to Frame Construction,"I purchased this because I was very impressed with the ""Graphic Guide to Frame Construction"" book. I was much less impressedby this book - lighter on the details and less updated."
5,Great! Great!,beautiful CD! fast shipping1 perfect! I love this CD and the one i had was scratched it was very old.
3,Not Everlasting but keeps my dog busy,The first time I used this it kept my dog entertained for hours. He figured out how to get the treat out of the ball so now it will keep him entertained for maybe 30 minutes. Really expensive to keep buying these treats that distract him for such a short period of time now.
2,The Fifteen Minute lasting treat.,"I got this for my Cairn terrier puppy when I first got him and I have to say, the idea is a good one but execution is poor. There are two basic problems with this toy.1) My dog just licks it until the treat gets smaller and then manages to pull it out and finish it. This takes maybe fifteen minutes at most.2) Even if he didn't do that, after about three uses the rubber became loose around the treat, so that now it basically just pops out by itself.So save your money and invest it in something more durable."
1,too small for large dogs,"I did not like these, they said they lasted long an for big dogs.My dogs swollowed them whole and did not even chew them"
2,dog liked it,"My dog liked it but what doesn't he like. He chewed this up in 10 minutes. ""My money"". I thought it was going to last longer."
5,Dog loves these!,"I bought these after the toy they go to was recommended to me for a pit bull who easily eats everything! Although she can easily get the treats out of the ball, she loves to spend time chewing on these, and they keep her busy for a long time. which means that she is not getting into trouble or chewing on my childrens toys!"
2,"Once the treat is out of the holder, game over","I'd seen this for a while, but now that I'm trying to get my 18mo old Labradoodle to transition out of his crate, I thought this might be the perfect treat to keep him busy during this phase.Unfortunately, my fluff monster managed to knock the treat ball out of the holder within minutes, within another 10 minutes it was completely gone. Really disappointing, considering the price of these treats (and the $20-$25 investment in the holder). I guess I'll stick to stuffing kongs for a while longer, even though I hate cleaning up the mess."
1,Check the ingredients out.,"These are not premium ingredients, glutens are not something I feed my dogs, and the poultry is not one of the first ingredients...I'll stick with pizzles, tendons, raw bones...that actually do clean teeth.Everlasting Treat Ingredients: Wheat Gluten, Gelatine, Water, Glycerin, Poultry Meat and Bone Meal, Natural Flavoring, Corn Gluten Meal, Garlic Powder, Brewer's Yeast, Lecithin, Sodium Diacetate, Vegetable Gum, Titanium Dioxide, and Natural Coloring."
1,Diarrhea!,"After I gave my dog this treat, she had diarrhea for 2 days!. What a mess! She won't be getting this again."
1,NOT everlasting at all,"My 10 month old german shepherd loved it. And loved it so much that in about 5 minutes he was already chewing pieces off the thing. In exactly 45 minutes the damn thing was GONE. My dog had eaten it all. I don't think it's going to hurt him, but this is NOT an everlasting treat AT ALL, definitely not for 60 pound + dogs (my pup is a very strong 80 pound gsd - all muscles, no fat)."
1,Sick,"My Dachshund devoured the treat in about 3 minutes flat. Now she seems like she isn't feeling well and I'm going to take her to the vet because I think it may have given her a bowel impaction. Great. Don't get these, please. I got them at a feed store thinking it would keep her entertained for a while.. nope. Just made her sick. I think I paid like $17 for the ball and a package of refills. What a waste."
1,Everlasting? Not even for 1 hour!,"This is one of the quite typical case of misleading descriptions and claims. This so called ""everlasting"" and ""large"" treat did not last for even an hour after I gave it to my dog. It is a dinky little thing. Totally not worth your money."
3,Enjoyable but hardly everlasting,"These treats are good fun for my dog for about 30 min. He loves them but it takes about 30 seconds for him to remove the treat from the holder and maybe 15 to 30 minutes to eat the treat. They are good, I just wish they lasted longer."
5,winner winner chicken dinner!,"My dog LOVES these. She loves to chew on things and this is the first toy that she has not destroyed within the first week. We have had the ball that these treats insert into for over 2 months and it still is like new. The chicken flavor appears to be her favorite so far. They will last several days if we don't take the toy away, longer if we limit her exposure or rotate toys. She will lick and lick and chew and chew for hours. Inserting the treats is a bit difficult but not too bad. We have not had any problems with her removing the treat as others have described, my guess is that they are not getting the treat set into the ball correctly. This chew toy is a keeper!"
1,Of course it lasts forever; the dogs don't go near it.,"My dogs love chew treats such as rawhide bones and bully sticks. How great, I thought it would be, to buy a dog treat that had some staying power. Staying power it has. What it lacks is any attraction for my dogs.It was a waste of money. Not that much money, but a waste all the same."
2,"It's okay, pricey.","I got this from Petsmart for my Aussie mix. She is the destroyer of toys, even the toughest of toys will last 2 days at most, I spent something like $40 on tough toys one night and they were destroyed by the following night. Yes, I walk her, she gets walked over 4 miles per day, goes to the dog park 2-4 times a week, and gets to play tug with my brother and I every night.She's just friggin smart and finds the weak points in toys quickly, her record is the Kong 'Wubba' - destroyed in 2 minutes, plush stuffed toys I don't even bother with because she rips in to them instantly.So I got this to see if it can keep her occupied, it did, for about 3 hours. Instead of biting the ball, she licked the treat till it was soggy and then just took it out and ate it. Not bad but a Nylabone costs half as much and lasts way longer, not as tempting for her sure but I bought a Nylabone Durachew for $11 a month ago and though it's now half its original size, at least it's still around."
1,Everlasting can be very short,"I was pleased to,read about these treats and thought what a good time my dog would have with them. It lasted about 10 minutes. I think there is something amiss with the product description"
5,My lab loves these!,"My black lab mix loves these. It doesn't take very long (probably an hour or so) for him to remove the top ""dome"" part of the treat and make it a flat cookie inside the blue dispenser ball. The flat part of the treat lasts another four or five days until it's just a ring inside the ball and finally the ring will take him about another week to remove and consume. He loves these things so much that I have to put refills in his ball while he is outside doing his business or I can't even get enough space in the kitchen to pop the new one in before he's trying to take it back! And even when the ball is empty he carries it around and licks around the inside of the dispenser part. I guess he's licking the smell out haha!"
3,"Five stars for the dog, one star for me","All of my dogs went nuts when I gave this to my 55 lb., only 5 month old, German Shepherd puppy. I have a 15 lb Bichon and a 4lb Yorkie-Poo. They were willing to (literally) walk into the Big Bad Wolf's den. So, the dogs go nuts over this. I do not. It stinks. I cannot stand the smell of it. Perhaps if you have an ""outside"" dog this would be fine...but, no, it would attract skunks and raccoons. You have to REALLY LOVE YOUR DOG if you are willing to put up with the smell. (bully sticks are nothing compared to these) And, to add insult to injury, the toy that I purchased with these inserts does not comply with those inserts. I would've really appreciated a heads up on that. I would have been happy to buy the truly corresponding toy."
1,Choking hazard,"Seemed like a great idea, and my dog loved it, but when she began choking on the treat, I threw them away. She's a 40-lb lab and loves to chew on anything she can get. It only took her 5 minutes to figure out how to get the treat out of the ball. She's fine. I was able to immediately dislodge the treat from the back of her mouth, but the scare was enough to decide I wouldn't let her have them again. She does still enjoy playing with the ball."
1,my cavie puppy choked on these!!,"If I hadn't been right there watching, he would have choked to death. He had worked the round treat loose from the toy and chewed the edges until he tried to swallow it. I used Heimlich to remove it. Don't leave your dog unattended with any chew toy!"
2,Disappeared too quickly,We have purchased these several times. This past time our dog got it out of the holder and ate the whole thing in less than an hour. Too expensive to have it last this short of time.
3,everlasting treat,they wont get it untill christmas but its worth the price -I think they will love it
3,Gone in one session,"My dog sat and cried when I gave him this in his Christmas bag. He finally figured it out but he ate the whole thing in one session. I was hoping for something that would last several days. It did not smell very good, but that didn't stop my dog I guess."
1,no Dog likes it but NO makes her sick,not long lasting really and makes the dog sick when she eats too much of the treat. I have to take it away from her after a few minutes so she doesn't eat too much. If she eats the whole thing she gets the hershey squirts (liquid stool frequently). I think a better long lasting treat is peanut butter inside a bone or kong FROZEN. That keeps her busy and she doesn't get sick.
5,Noisy and Fun,I bought this for my Mom's small dog and she loves it. She can play tug with it and it makes alot of noise...which she really loves. It is pliable and soft and it is well made. You won't be sorry with this toy!
1,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with this book. I had been looking for a book like this so when I saw it, I grabbed it up. Most of the recipes are not what I would consider low-carb at all. There were a lot of starchy foods listed in the ingredients of the recipes I browsed through. Too bad I didn't keep my receipt, I could return the book."
1,"No ""low carb"" here!","I wish I'd seen the other review before I ordered this book. It's a low carber's nightmare! Many recipes are for ""side"" dishes, and not made in the crock pot, and I do not believe that the (high) carb counts on the recipes are even accurate. Sure, I could keep this and try to modify the recipes to fit my diet-but what's the point?! If you are watching your carb intake for whatever reason-AVOID THIS BOOK!"
2,So-so recipes,"I bought this book to get some variety in my slow-cooker recipe collection, not because I am on a low-carb diet. So I've made some of the recipes, and they're not terrible, but they aren't great, either. Although the book does avoid the typical ""add a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup"" for the most part, which is a nice change, nearly all the recipes still call for some kind of starch to make the sauce thick: tapioca, cornstarch, flour. If you don't want every meal to be covered with a thick, jellied sauce, don't make these recipes! A good cook will be able to adapt them, but I wish I'd saved my money."
4,Mostly gluten-free!,"I know that this is supposed to be a low-carb cookbook, but I bought it because most of the recipes are gluten free. There are a few that call for cream of something soup or barley (neither acceptable on a GF diet), but most have basic ingredients and sauces. I've enjoyed all but one of the recipes I've made from the cookbook, and it's great to find a book with so many GF recipes."
1,High Carb slow Cooker Recipes,I only paid $4.50 for this book at a discount bookseller. I think I paid too much.
4,Low-carb isn't all about losing weight!,"I think this cookbook is great...is it for Phase 1 folks on South Beach or Atkins Induction people? No, but there's more to low-carb than just the first two weeks of the program.For those of us who have been off of the ""20 carbs a day"" thing for many months and on low-carb maintenance, it's refreshing to find new recipes to fix. As anyone who has been on a low-carb diet for an extended period of time can tell you, life can get mighty boring and spicing up the way we fix food is always a good idea.I also liked how many veggies are in the recipes to once show again that low-carb isn't all about how much meat and fat you can stick into a recipe. For the people who are up to 60-100 carbs a day, this is a great cookbook with easy recipes that don't take forever and are full of flavor.If you're losing weight the low-carb way this isn't the book for you...but then again, the title of the book isn't Induction Slow Cooker Recipes."
1,Cash-in Junk,"As others have stated, this is not a proper low-carb cookbook. It is an attempt to cash-in on the (formerly) popular diet by recycling a set of normal run-of-the-mill slow-cooker recipes. Had this book lacked the ""Low-Carb"" moniker, I would've given it two stars for having carb count information available in the corner and having a decent selection of recipes. The reasonably informative introduction does match the recipe selection in terms of philosophy. Unfortunately, that philosophy is the typical hedge against the traditional food-pyramid diet. It's really unfortunate that the low-carb diet has been given so many hurdles to mainstream acceptance because it addresses very well the dietary needs of a great portion of the American populace. This book, coming from mainstay Better Homes and Gardens, did nothing to advance the important cause."
2,Moderate-Carb Slow Cooker,"This is definitely not a low carb cook book, perhaps a moderate carb cook book but even still there are a lot well, almost all of the recipes that make a stew or soup have white potatoes in them. Not for the Atkins diet or the induction of the South Beach, I liked some of the ideas but often felt myself substituting the potatoes for sweet potatoes, turnips or cauliflower."
2,Low-carb buyer beware!,"This looks like a perfectly decent slow cooker cookbook, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. But putting ""low carb"" in the title and saying it's full of recipes ""for carb counters"" is wildly misleading. Hint #1: just putting the carb count on the recipe, without modifying it to actually make it low-carb (like, I don't know, maybe taking potatoes out!) does NOT make it a cookbook for low-carbers.I'll give just one example: the Dijon Pork Chops call for a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and potatoes to create a recipe with 39 carbs per serving. Unbelievable! Just for comparison, the two chop recipes in Dana Carpender's200 Low-Carb Slow Cooker Recipesare Tangy Pork Chops for 11g carbs and Mustard Pork Chops for only 4g carbs. Hint #2: neither one uses a can of condensed soup or any sort of root vegetable."

4,HISTORY of Garage & Original House Music,"This CD lives up to the hype. Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles were making history in the late 70's and 80's. I grew up on Frankie, but Larry was first. The music is all from the era before 1980. You get over 80 minutes of seamless, transitional, dance music of the day. There are elements of Jazz, R&B, Disco, Dance all present here. From beginning to end, this is a moving CD."
4,Leapin and Lopin - Larry Levan,"This mixed CD is Jumpin. If you're into the warehouse DEEP House grooves, you'll love these mixes. Levan produced a work of a genius with his remix of songs, his choice of songs and the placement of those songs in the mix. Disc 2 is too short. I wish I could have been at one of his parties when he was alive."
3,What Am I Missing?,"I have great respect for Larry Levan, and I wish he would have lived to see the impact he had on dance music, but my feeling is that this was an off night for him, because his mixing is really bad! I've been a DJ since the 70's, and I know that back then with live drums (instead of computers and drum machines keeping a perfect beat) and the equipment we had, it wasn't easy to mix from one song to another flawlessly. But, I listen to this CD and I feel like I'm listening to one of my old tapes, on one of those nights when I had one cocktail too many. I guess you had to be there?!"
5,AWESOME Namie,"This is the ultimate Namie Amuro, in this CD she shows every style she desires to show! You will love it."
2,too hot for baby?,"I used this headrest in place of the one that comes with the infant Graco carseat, which didn't seem to provide much head support. This one provides the support but my baby did not like it and her crying made for a very unpleasant car experience. I think that it is either too constricting or too hot. I bought the padded animal shoulder straps instead and she seems to like those."
5,Great Kids Book...,"I grew up with my father reading this book to me as a bed time story, It was my favorite book growing up and I was curious if Amazon.com had it and apparently they do...It is a story about a stray cat and a classroom adopts him as their school pet...If you are looking for a good bed time story book to read to your kids, this is it!"
5,World War Two from a German Perspective,"During the Second World War, each country had it's propaganda machine running in high gear. The purpose of which was to de-Humanize the enemy while reminding everyone of the good things about their own country. The United States had ""Look"" and ""Life"" magazines. The Germans had ""Signal"".This book, and the others in this series of collections of Signal magazine articles, is an idealized view into the picture of German life painted by the ministers of propaganda. No serious collection of World War Two literature would be complete without at least some of the excellent S.L. Mayer books. I was so impressed with the books, I have donated two to the college library where I teach."

1,BOOOOOOOOOOOO,"WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE STOP THIS LADY FROM RUINING THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE... I KEEP BUYING THE BOOKS EVEN WITH HER NAME ON THEM, ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE STAR WARS... AND I THINK EACH TIME, HOW BAD COULD SHE SCREW UP THE CHARACTERS I KNOW AND LOVE... AND EACH TIME SEE DOES IT AGAIN... STOP HER PLEASE... BEFORE SHE KILLS OFF LUKE OR LEIA IN SOME BORING MYNOCK FIGHT TO THE DEATH... HEY BARB... KNOW WHAT A MYNOCK IS?"
1,HAMBLYS A HACK!,"These books(Children of the Jedi and Planet of Twilight)prove that Hambly has no business writing Star Wars novels. Hambly has a weak grasp on the characters of Star Wars. In a genre and series whose readers are keen to every small detail in a characters life small changes on the part of the author make a huge unwanted difference. I would not consider these books to be Star Wars novels. The characters were Hamblys own, not the characters that we all know. The only things that remained were the names. Hambly wrote her own stories with weak fluffy pages that had nothing to do with Star wars. The stories are slow,overly descriptive, and extremely choppy. In these books Hambly failed miserably."
4,O.K.,"Evil Hutts, super weapons, a mad imperial dictator, and a princess held captive? This may sound like the novelization of episode IV but it's not. This is the book Planet of Twilight by Barbara Hambly. It starts of with a plauge, and then goes onto an adventure with B-wings, droids, hyperspace, and mutated misquitos. this book shows us that even admidst our differences we can all help each other(Awwwwwwww)."
3,where to take it?...,"I don't know where to take this book, I read through once, and I intend to read darksaber and Children of the Jedi, only because I'm curious about the way she handles things in that book. I mean some things in this book is hard to follow, I enjoyed it none the less, but I've read Courtship of Princess Leia too... which is by far a better book but as someone that doesn't swear by star wars with an undieing loyalty of some. I won't cut this book down. I don't like to read the trilogies only because I don't like the Idea of having to read three novels just the get the whole story line hence the reason I like the stand alone novels but anyway... I don't hinder anyone from reading this book but do read "" Courtship..."" which I do highly recomend."
3,read it,CHILDREN OF THE JEDI is better but this one is still enjoyable. The openeing is good and the head bad guy is a clever and gruesome creation. The relationship between Luke and Callista was so well built in CHILDREN OF THE JEDI and DARKSABER that it ends dissapointingly here.
3,read it,CHILDREN OF THE JEDI was better but this one is still enjoyable. The opening is good and the master villian is a clever and gruesome creation. The relationship between Callista and Luke was so well built in CHILDREN OF THE JEDI and DARKSABER that it ends dissapointingly in this one.
1,"Revolting....waste of trees,time,money,brain cells","This is quite possibly the most pathetic book of all time. Hambly seems Hell-bent on keeping Luke in anguish through tho whole eternaly long whine-fest. moving with the pace of a granite slug, the plot is as stupid as the idea of an overgrown tapeworm holding a planet hostage which is managed to slip in as well.this book has dragged the star wars name down to the level of the sub-humanoid specieces of coruscants lowest level. do not waste your money or your time on this. Barbara Hambly should try writing drivel for the enquirerer."
1,Boring...Boring...BORING!!!! Did I mention this book sucked!,"This is absolutely the worst book I have probably ever read! The characters are dim and have no distinguishing characteristics. Hambly writes her characters and stories like a crappy romance novel. The story makes no sense and the least she could have let was Luke and Callista have some sort of relationship in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed Darksaber, it at least kept me wanting to read after the first page. I picked up this book expecting Luke and Callista to encounter eachother more througout the story. The least Hambly could have done was kill off Callista. And enough with Leia always being the brave and heroic one! Give Han and Luke a chance to show that they can be brave without being wussies. All in all, not worth the money I spent. Don't bother to even read the summary. Don't read the title! Stay as far away from this book and Barbara Hambly as you possibly can!"
1,A new SW book with what?...,This was such a disappiontment! I generally don't quite like the author's books as they are rather boring. I was teribly bored!!!!!!
1,I wish I could've given it ZERO stars........,"Suck, suck, SUCK! Just like her previous book. It was lame to the core, poorly paced, and didn't make ANY sense! How many people think Luke would be such a whiny brat? If you know Luke's character, you would know that he's always ready to help and make a change. He just seemed lethargic and dull. And Callista. If she really loved him, it wouldn't have mattered if she was powerless or not. What the heck happens to Leia? She gets kidnapped....BORING! I can't believe I spent over $20 on a book that SUCKED so bad. Hambly couldn't write worth beans. Stop writing ""Star Wars"" stuff, lady. Your work is ill-paced, effortless, boring, and shows lack of a developed plot line. I recommend people trash this one."
2,Good idea executed poorly,"I liked the idea that the book was based on, but there is a complete lack of execution in making the story worth reading. I tried so hard to finish it because it was Star Wars, but alas I could not."
2,I'd give it 2 1/2 if it would let me....,"the plot of the story was not bad, it could have been a very good book, but however the author is entirely too wordy, she completely ruins the characters, they don't act at all how they should have. but all in all it wasnt a bad story, the concept was good, but the presentation was poor, i would give it a 2 1/2 for effort it would let, but since it wont, 2 will have to do."
1,Didn't care for it at all,"As far as Star Wars books go, this ones rates as second-worst only to The Crystal Star. Improbabilities, characters acting out of character, and the return of Callista -who wasn't a particularly interesting character the first time around. Plus the villain itself wasn't particularly believable. All in all? I would advise any true Star Wars fans to avoid this book."
4,"Good, But a Little Confusing.","This was a pretty good book. The other people say it's bad, but they're wrong. Farther into the book you get a feel on what is going on. The book has a very good plot and it could use a little more action, but it's a good. My favorite part was when Leia has her first lightsaber fight. I think that this book is worth the read, and it's worth spendig you're money on it."
1,Don't Bother,"I read this book almost a year ago and frankly I can't even remember what happened in it. I'm very glad that I can't remember what happened, this book was horrid. Don't even bother reading it unless you are a huge Star Wars fan and even then you may not want to. All I remember is that I had to force (no pun intended) myself to get through this book and that the whole thing was boring. Spend time reading Zahn's works if you want to enjoy some good Star Wars, because Planet of Twilight is totally lacking."
3,It's really not that bad.,"I wasn't expecting much when I first bought. I mean, her previous Star Wars novel Children of the Jedi was absolutely horrible. Anyways, this novel did surpass my expectations. It did have some of the good stuff you would look for in a Star Wars story, like lightsaber fights. It was nice to see the New Republic facing defeat (again), as it was nice to see the droids get a somewhat bigger part than they've been getting. (I do think, however, that Bantam shouldn't have hired so many Star Trek writers to write Star Wars novels. You can sometimes really tell in the writing.)"
2,Still not up to the standard of the star wars universe,"Looking at the reaction of most readers it would seem that i must be an oddball. This book just as ""Chidren of the Jedi"" is boring, lacking excitement and never get the pulse going. As with ""Children"" i struggled all the way through this book. The chapters are way too long just as the previous novel was, at 20 to 30 pages a chapter this is not a pick up and put down book, it is a journey that never seems to end. I wish everybody could be a Kevin Anderson or Steve Perry and such like, but it seems that it is not just possible."
4,Hambly has done it again,"Hambly has made yet another exciting story plot. It was difficult to get into, but once I did, it was impossible for me to stop reading. Hambly could have come up with a better way to fit Han and the droids in the plot, though. And she seems to be dragging out this relationship between Luke and Callista. Either continue the relationship or stop it. There's no need to have it drag out for ten years. (Which it has, if anyone has read the Young Jedi Knights series. Luke's still single.) However, Leia had an excellent part in the story. It's tempting to give away the entire plot when it comes to her. Luke spent most of his time searching for Callista, but imminently had a few adventures along the way."
1,Poor writing style and uneven pacing ruins this one,"I have read most of the Star Wars books out there. Usually I'm thoroughly engrossed within the first 50 pages. However, in this case, I was not. I found that the author tends to just skip over transitions from one place to another. One paragraph the characters are in a ship, and the next moment they are somewhere completely different, and the reader has to reverse and scan because characters aren't where they were assumed to be. In addition, many of the most fascinating aspects of the story are left murkily unexplained and poorly described. I felt like reading this one was more of a chore than enjoyable. Apparently this author likes to ensure that the reader is willing to re-read paragraphs to keep up. Not much fun."
1,This was one of the worst,"Barbara should have quit at ""Children of the Jedi"" which was just as bad! I gave it a try but I just didn't like it! Oh and to top it all off Callista was in it, she already ruined two other books but they keep bringing her back! Give it up!"
2,"I'm kind of neutral on the whole thing, but...","personally, I didn't like Planet of Twilight just because it doesn't seem to line up with all of the other stuff that is out there. It just seems to be little details of continuity in the writing that keep me from liking the work. Hambly can write well, but flowery, descriptive sentences that go on and on (early on in the book I think there was a sentence that took six lines to painfully unfold), is not what the typical Star Wars fan is looking for. We are used to seeing the story unfold and move at the speed of light in the Star Wars books and it just doesn't happen here. As with her other book, Children of the Jedi, I find myself falling asleep much more quickly in my pre-bedtime reading ritual."
4,"Good, and written with a stylful prose, but somewhat boring.","Planet of Twilight has a good plot, is interesting, and a treat to stay with, but was slow paced, and at times, boring. It's written with a definite prose; a prose I seem to recall from the time I read Children of the Jedi, which was only marginally better. Though good, this ranks amongst the lesser Star Wars novels which include the two above mentioned novels and The Black Fleet Crisis, written by Michael P. Kube-McDowell"
5,An ecellent sequel to Children of the Jedi and Dark Saber.,I like all of te Star Wars books but I paticulary like thisgroup. It gives us more of an insight to Luke and his Personalitybeyond the Jedi Master.
4,Star Wars,While I won't say this is one of my favorite Star Wars books it is an interesting story. It is also an important part of the Star Wars Universe of books.
1,Wasted Time....,"The universe of Star Wars is a great place to be, with books and movies to help take you there. This book shatters that nice universe. While BH might be a good writer of her other books (I've never read them), her writing some of the books of Star Wars is an example of how badly we need some new plots, and better writers. BH seemingly does not know how to handle more than one person in a book, this entire book is about Leia. Throughout this whole book, everone is off doing something by doing nothing. I counted only once where Luke used the force, and at times where he could have used the force to help him, he would have these little excuses to the effect of: ""I can't concentrate"".There are a few good parts in ""Planet of Twilight"", but mostly you are waiting for them to happen. So if you are a fan of BH, buy the book and form your own oppinion of it, but if you are a fan of Star Wars, reread the Rogue Squadron series until the next Star Wars book comes out."
2,Yawn-O-Rama!,"Just about the only good thing in this book is the return of Callista. It was good to hear from her again,but she really wasn't the same character. Han Solo was off doing something else and his part in this book was otherwise secluded. I can only remember about three of the original characters ever meeting at the same time. The book went by so slowly that many times I spent hours trying to understand only one chapter. The main character was Leia and it might as well have been titled ""Small Book of Leia."" All of the others may as well not even been mentioned in this ""book."" They weren't mentioned that much anyway. Action was rare and had no background. It was every bit of a waste of my time!"
2,Pretty dull,"This is not a Star Wars book. It might say it is, have the Star Wars names in it, but it is not. If you are after an exciting thrill fest, go buy something else"
1,SOMEONE STOP HER!!!,"WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE STOP THIS LADY FROM RUINING THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE... I KEEP BUYING THE BOOKS EVEN WITH HER NAME ON THEM, ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE STAR WARS... AND I THINK EACH TIME, HOW BAD COULD SHE SCREW UP THE CHARACTERS I KNOW AND LOVE... AND EACH TIME SEE DOES IT AGAIN... STOP HER PLEASE... BEFORE SHE KILLS OFF LUKE OR LEIA IN SOME BORING MYNOCK FIGHT TO THE DEATH... HEY BARB... KNOW WHAT A MYNOCK IS?"
2,More of the same,"Has anyone noticed that the Star Wars plots, with the exception of Timothy Zahn's, are being repeated over and over again? With the latest batch of one volume tales, a small crisis happens, someone goes to investigate, they uncover something that could destroy the universe and the New Republic, all the main characters get together, Luke usually gets injured, and they overcome insurmountable obstacles to save the day. Well, this book is the same thing. About the only thing that was even interesting was Leia and a Hutt having a lightsaber duel! Stick with the X-wing books and/or the original Zahn trilogy. Zahn's newest book also shows some potential to break out of the mold. Of course, if you've got a friend who bought this, go ahead and read it, but I wouldn't bother reading it."
1,What can I say? They wouldn't let me give it no stars...,"This comes from the ""What in God's name were they thinking"" pile. I can't believe that they actually let this woman write another SW book. In all my years as a Star Wars fan I have never come across a book that I felt actually made me less intelligent by reading it. I started reading this book while in a dentist's waiting room awaiting a root canal. I don't know which one was more painful. Avoid this book at all costs."
1,TIMOTHY ZAHN.....YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE,This book is .... I am literally at a loss for words. It's long and awful.
1,Wait a second...how did this horrid book get by Lucas?,"Planet of Twilight was the creepiest books I ever read. I found myself flipping to parts with Han or Leia. I don't really know how it ends because I gave up once I read about those disgusting 'drochs'. The plot was a mess, the characters seemed to have lost their personalities (poor, poor Han!), and when Callista (who I can't stand from Children of the Jedi) showed up, I couldn't stand it anymore. I know Lucasfilm has to approve Star Wars books before they're published. All I can say is that somebody let this one slip by them."
1,Long and drawn out!,"This is perhaps the worst of the Star Wars books. It does have a good plot, yet it could have been shortened significantly with less detail in unnecessary delict or insignificant parts of the story line."
1,Let me just say this,"I think that this is, without doubr the worst Star Wars book ever written. There is no plot, no chacter development nothing. I read this book several years ago and can still remmeber clearly the absolute confusion I was in upon reading it. If you don't believe me take a look at the sample pages."
2,Could be better,"I enjoyed Children Of The Jedi (Also by Barbara Hambly), but this book was a letdown. Try Specter of the Past, or Jedi Search."
1,The Force?,"I would rather sh-- a double-bladed lightsaber than read this book again. BH uses sorry exuses to push the Force out of her books (ex.1 <Luke:My leg . . . oh no I can't concetrate ex. 2 <Luke: Oh no . . . the drochs, I can't concentrate.) Anyone noticing a pattern? This is the ultimate example of wishful Star Trek thinking at its worst."
3,Gets better as you read on,"I thought the first part was so boring! I was almost falling asleep!!! It got better as it went on. Hambly sure improved a lot from that terrible book ""Children of the Jedi"". It's an OK book."
2,Diappointing James Bomb soft-core spoof,"I really wanted to like this book (and it's sibling The Desdamona Affair), as Clyde Allison has a reputation for clever, sexy thrillers and crime stories, with the tongue often firmly placed in the cheek. And it was an Agent 0008 of SADISTO story - the pinnacle of the author's fame, I thought!But I'm afraid I found this too book simplistic and dull, with average writing, a thin cartoonish plot, sex sequences that were repetitive to the extent of being boring, and an ending that felt like the author decided that he was going to wrap it up in the last 4 pages whatever happened. And to add to the experience, the proof-reading of this edition was very poor - typographical errors were frequent.So, I'm forced to report this was a real disappointment, to me anyway - and I warn others accordingly. And I'm not going to review The Desdamona Affair, as I gave up reading it part-way ..."
4,Definitely a unique and impressive debut,"If I had to explain this album in one word, it would definitely be ""unique"". How often do you come across an album that starts off with a mellow instrumental? Not often. Hence the originality of this album, which first drew my ears in the direction of Doves. Aside from the uniqueness of the alubm, the band placed the songs very cleverly so it's a good listen the whole way through. It's a very impressive debut, to say the least. The overall sound of the album is very meloncholy, but there are some songs that are more upbeat than the rest. Very melodic and sometimes beautifully symphonic-sounding rock. I highly recommend this album."
5,JUST OUTSTANDING!!!,"This group is so much deserving of praise and recognition. They have this atmospheric, dark, intense sound to them. They are in a category all their own. Their songs are a little on the long side, which some people might find boring, but those who understand the beauty in it will appreciate them. My favorite song on the cd is ""The Sea Song"". This song leaves me in awe. Totally worth the money I spent. I think these guys will be making music for a long time to come, and I plan on being there when they do. In case no one else has mentioned it, a couple of the guys from Doves are additional musicians on the Badly Drawn Boy cd, The Hour Of Bewilderbeast. Buy and treaure this cd!"
2,You can skip it,"Catch the Sun apart, there is not much here worth more than 5 listens. If you are looking for something new to listen to, you've come to the wrong place."
3,ddddoooovvvesss,"Sounds good,not great--sounds like others--seems like a reallynice record has no deep passion-- to average to spend money on."
3,Wildly Overrated,"There is one--ONE--outstanding song on this CD, and it is over 7 minutes long (and lets face it, only the Stone Roses and Janes Addiction can pull that off). This labum is wildly, wildly overrated. Beware tyhe astroturf."
4,Dive In,"Doves are sort of an inverse doppelganger to their label-mates the Chemical Brothers: the Chems enjoy their electronica laced with a little rock 'n' roll; Doves enjoy their rock 'n' roll laced with a little electronica. Breezy, jangly. Lovely, lonely. Lost Souls is a shimmering jewel of an album."
4,A mighty fine piece of work,"A fantastic album. One of the best I've purchased in quite a while. I actually bought it on a lark and am very glad I did. I've listened to it many times since...""Lost Souls"" is great to put on at night to help wind down for the evening or while driving around in your car. There is an intense, jazzy vibe to this album that permeates almost every track. No ""5"" because a few of the tracks don't do anything for me.""Firesuite"" is pure genius and ""Sea Song"" never fails to deliver the goods. The most commercial song on the album, ""The Man Who Told Everything,"" is wonderful from the unusual instrumentation that begins the track to the intelligent lyrics. If you are asking yourself if you should buy this album, the answer is yes."
5,When the Computer is not OK,"I picked this album up last night based on amazon recommendations, and I haven't taken it out of my CD player yet. Basically, it is absolutely amazing background music. Its not too loud or too soft, and has a terrific amount of sonic variety.I'll be the first to admit that I haven't really gotten into the whole Radiohead sound. Too often, it sounds like my old TRS-80 computer wanting to jam. It just really has no effect on me other than wanting to play 'break-out'.What I really like about the Doves is that they are actually playing instruments! When I read the reviews here, I thought ""big deal"", too. But, it really makes a difference. The sound is more full and classic (in a Pet Sounds kind-of-way...)I'm happy I bought it...."
3,Front Rank,"The fifteen tracks of Doves debut CD Lost Souls last for approximately 72 minutes. That's a lot of time to assimilate this Manchester trio, especially when the CD doesn't hit its stride until midway through its sixth song, the title track, which sounds like the Cure fronted by Badly Drawn Boy. From there on out, including bonus tracks, Lost Souls is a front rank piece of work, especially the rockish ""Catch the Sun"", haunting ""The Cedar Room"", and folksy ""A House"". Songs one through five are dream pop of varying degrees of usefulness. I'd prefer never to hear any of them again. The beauty of CD programming is that I never have to."
4,"MUCH Better that ""The Last Broadcast""","Warning: This is a gut-reaction. I just bought this album about 2 hours ago. I will say this, for certain: it kicks ...their other album, The Last Broadcast. That album was totally unimpressive in comparison. This album flows very nicely. No tracks are really losers. But nothing stands out in a profound manner. It's excellent relaxing background music, but I don't think of it as an album you can ever really listen to and sit there for an hour just enwrapped in the music. It's not as engaging as that. But for what it is, it is excellent. It only recieves 4 stars because I rarely find a perfect album. Really a great effort from a good band. Nothing revolutionary, I don't think, but they're good. Check it out if you like good chill-out music or enjoy mellow, atmospheric tunes like Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here""."
3,It's good,"I'll keep this short. Lost Souls is good but not as good as their latest release ""The Last Broadcast"". But this album does have alot of good songs and is definetly worth buying. Check it out."
5,Excellent CD (from a group I have never heard of),"I had never heard of this group, but saw the videos for ""catch the sun"" and ""the man"". So I sampled it at the local CD store.I enjoyed this album from the first listen, which is rare for me. It took me several listens to get past the whinings of the singers of coldplay, travis, and radiohead. (Not to put these artists down, but after several listens I have come to enjoy them all).Musically, much more experimental than travis or coldplay. Though, not as experimental as radiohead or Massive Attack for you conservative music listeners.I was shocked to find out that the Doves are a British Band. I thought they were from Michigan or Minnesota. Its a great album to escape from the boring and redundant American Music Scene."
4,"Strong writing, but hazy production prevent greatness","This doesn't have a bad track, the problem is that the production and track selection makes the album as a whole a mood setter and nothing more. Certainly, when you're listening to the album you know you're listening to good songs, but at the same time the songs don't really stick out as completely separate, but equal entities. Some song's music could be interchangable with another one and this is a longer album. It does become a tad monotonous in it's mellow nature at times and that's what keeps it from being great."
1,DO NOT BUY,I bought these speakers thinking they would be nice to listen to in my room but I was wrong the sound is horrible. If you do buy these dont buy these speakers from www_eblazingttech_com because they sent me the ipod ones.
1,Package is worth more than speakers,"This product was purchased with some expectations that would be somewhat equivelent to speaker phone volume on my cell. It is W O R T H L E S S. You can barely hear it, my bud ear phones are louder just laying those out in the open. Great marketing and packaging for a useless piece of junk... Wouldn't even sell it on ebay for 2 cents because I'd be screwing someone out of their money... Dr. Chase PhD CS I give it Negative 10 stars, worse than nothing"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this speaker for my sansa view. piss poor sound quality, very tinny. If you turn it up above a whisper volume the sound gets badly distorted. It doesn't fit very well if you have any kind of skin or case on your sansa. VERY fragile, I set mine down on the table(from about 1.5 inches up) and the plug snapped off. Pure junk don't waste your money."
2,A situational product,"These speakers are okay to listen to in a quiet office setting. Perhaps they would also be okay for a work setting. So, they have fit the bill for me. Otherwise, they are pretty weak. But, for the price, you only get what you pay for."
3,Deal,"Got what I paid for, a small speaker system for personal use. Now I can ride my bike and listen to music without breaking the law."
2,low quality device,"i was disappointed that this product was $20.00! its sound is very low quality and its volume is extremely low. also, if you forget to turn the speaker button to off, its battery runs down in no time!"
1,"Buddy ""Dumb"" Bell","Buddy's name is on the book, but the way he manages he follows none of the advice that the book gives.Obviously a sham to earn money by using a household baseball name."
1,Boring,"This is too routine and fabricated for the real Grand Funk Railroad. By this time the band had lost its edge - and how many itmes do we need to hear the drum solo in .T.N.U.C? Get ""Live"" instead - when the music still mattered. It all died when they recoreded ""The Locomotion"" - are you kidding me?? What a joke!"
3,LP Version MUCH better!!,"This is a fun album to have. Unfortunately the CD cuts out some of the drum solo on T.N.U.C and the introduction on the LP is funny, and they cut it out of the CD. They at least could've fixed the silly ending they had to ""Closer to home"" so it doesn't fade out...come on, CD versions are suppose to be an improvement over the LPs not cut things out and leave the flaws. It still is a fun album, neat versions of ""Rock n' Roll Soul"" and ""Gimmie Shelter"". The First GFR Live album is much better, but if you like the post TK stuff live, then get this one or Bosnia. Capital is rumored to be remastering all of GFR albums on CD, including CITA, and hopefully they will improve it by not having ""Closer to Home"" fade and put back the crowed, announcements and the drum solo in tact. If you want CITA, until the remaster comes out, dust off your turntable and look through used album stores for it if you don't have it already. MUCH better then the CD version."
4,Grand Funk--Caught In The Act,"Having been in my long-haired prime at the time when this album was originally released on L.P. & 8-Track, I thought that Grand Funk sounded better live as a four-piece band than they did back in '70, as a three-piece band on the first live album. As musicians they had all polished-up their acts a bit, but hadn't lost any of the energy that they created when recorded live. When I listened to Caught In The Act for the first time, it sounded as good, if not better than the Grand Funk concert I had attended in '74. Although I felt that some of the songs they had chosen to record over the years were a bit too Top-40 for my tastes, it hasn't stopped me from again purchasing the album in a fourth form, CD. Any fan of Grand Funk should have this album in their collection as it represents just about the best work they ever did, live or in the studio. So I guess its true, if its too loud, you're too old."
5,One of the truly great live rock albums!,"When I was in college in the 70s, my roommate and I would slap this on the turntable, crank it up loud and just jam from start to finish. The energy of the band in this live show is fantastic and the recording quality is about as good as I have ever heard of an arena rock concert. I asked for (and got!) this on CD this past Christmas and can say the album still is breathtaking. The band are extremely tight, have great vocals and demonstrate outstanding musicianship. I wasn't a particular GFR fan back in college (or even now), but I still put this album very high on the island disk collection list."
5,Late era live Funk,"Grand Funk Railroad / Caught In The Act: This is an excellent live album that includes some early greats along with their late era pop-songs, which makes this the perfect substitute for those rather embarrassing late albums that had one or two hits and not much else. GFR was always a better live band than studio band and this CD is a treat. This however is far from being an `ultimate' live CD for, as good as it is, this is more of a companion piece to the earlier GFR live releases. Yet, this live CD deserves Five Stars."
4,A very good Rock Live album,"I was a kid in the seventies, my favorite band were Uriah Heep, Deep Purple and Grand Funk. I still like these bands and listening to ""Caught in the Act"" reminds me the good seventies. This is a very good Rock album and contains the ""almost"" perfect choice of songs, the sound is very good.A must have if you are a fan of the band or a classic rock music lover !"
5,Great Funk,Caught In The Act contains all the great songs recorded live on one CD. If you are looking for some good Grand Funk this may be the only one you will need. Sounds clean and great.Caught In The Act
4,a great sampler of new talent,"Corrigan has chosen a great selection of funky, post-punk rock writing. I especially loved the alt rock metaphor from Kristen Hersch and Emily Perkins woeful tale of weight problems and friendlessness. A ripping good read - perfect for a bus journey to a new city."
2,typical crap,"I got to the second story in this anthology and stopped short (therefore should probably not be writing a review). The story ""Saved"" is probably one of the most unecessary pieces of writing I have ever read. How does a gun toting killer (male) brutally killing a transvestite in a hotel room relate in any way to the feminist zeitgeist??? It made me sick. The story ""Story of Nick"" is alright, better, but feels equally as meaningless. I don't know. I guess I recommend that one simply read the morning paper for such depressing accounts of modern female life. Only 50 cents."
3,feminism is a dead form of thinking,"well...i loved all the stories in this book, bar ""tuberama""...but it left me with the question ""why are all these brilliant writers letting themselves be put into the feminist pigeon hole? so ignore the introduction if you will, it'll only put you in a bad mood...the stories are great, it is irrelevant that the ed. puts the feminist hard word on in the beginning. ignore it...stand out stories: 'saved' by Poppy Z. Brite & Christa Faust, 'having myself a time' by josie kimber amog the rest. good showcase of talented writers, who just happen to be very very smart women"
5,E O Tchan always delivers great party music!,Haven't been disappointed so far by E O Tchan! This music is fantastic for people who like to have fun and dance! Their music is very entertaining and enjoyable to listen to.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!,NON-STOP DANCING. GREAT MUSIC. A LOT OF FUN!! MAKES YOU WANT TO SAMBA AND PARTY...A MUST BUY!!
1,Axé Music,"If you like this...You still haven't listened the real brazilian music...Music for brainless people, whose do not appreciate the quality of brazilians composers. Try somenthing better or you will waste your money !!!"
5,Some Pigeonholes Reviews,"""... inventive, amusing, heartfelt, and filled with gems of social commentary and human awareness. Bravo!- Pat Launer, theater critic""'Tell Me Why' moved me very deeply. I LOVE that song! You are one brilliant dude, dude.""-David Pomeranz, multi-platinum award-winning recording artist, songwriter.""...a damned fine album, populated by great tunes and wonderfully meaningful and tight lyrics. If you don't know the music of Neal Fox then it is time you did.""- Mike Gibb, Spotlight On Musicals""Irreverent and wonderful""-Harriet Schock, platinum award winning songwriter""Fox delivers hooky melodies that in turn thrill you and then break your heart.""-The Entertainer""Pigeonholes... comes from an eminently honest place.""- Marty Westlin - San Diego City Beat Magazine""Poignant, genuine and sincere...thought provoking entertainment.""- Micheal Sheehan, Independent ReviewerRead the Pigeonholes story on the Apple Computer web site![...]"
5,Great blend of christmas cheer!,"This album has so many genres of music in it it's hard to believe it is a Christmas album. There is rock with Whiteheart's version of ""Little Drummer Boy"" (which is an AWESOME version), R&B with Tim Miner's ""The First Noel"", and even Tejano with Steve Taylor's ""Winter Wonderland"", which features a verse in Spanish! This is a fun filled album filled with the best of Sparrow artists of the 80's. I recommend to all!"
4,Great product,I use these very frequently to setup networks for clients. Highly recommended! I also suggest looking into the other steren products... there all great.
2,Does not stay frozen for very long!,"I put these in a cooler and was quite surprised that when I went to put frozen items in the cooler after shopping(only about an hour later) they were just about melted down! I will go back to using Blue Ice blocks, they last a really long time! To sum it all up I was really disappointed with this product."
2,unhappy with this product,"I was excited about this product--I liked that they were filled with water rather than a chemical gel--but it wasn't long before the ice ""pillows"" began to rip open. They also are very wet in the cooler--even when they don't break-- compared to traditional ""blue blocks"". disappointed--will need to replace soon."
5,Easier to use and store than stiff sheets,These fold up easily for either storage in the freezer or in your cooler. They maintain their temperature well and do what they are supposed to do.
2,no better than any other,I found these cold packs no better than any ice packs I bought at Dollar Tree Store(and they cost a lot more even with Amazon's discount). They don't keep things any colder for any longer period of time than what I had been previously using.
1,Icy Cools leak,"I purchased this product because it did get alot of good reviews, I used it twice and on the second time I found the bottom of my soft side cooler completely soaked! several of the thawed cubes had sprung a leak and what a mess!!! Its a great idea but very poor quality!!So because it truly was an Epic failure, I couldnt give it any star... well...I tried not to give it a star but Amazon forces at least one...."
5,Icy Cools Reusable Ice Mats,"Bought these for a trip to Maui. Took frozen food in a softsided cooler and wanted to make sure the food would stay frozen. The food was still frozen when we got to our condo after a 12 hour flight, 1 hour waiting for our luggage and a 45 minute drive to our condo.I also like the fact that when they do ""melt"" there is no water dripping. You just freeze and reuse. Shipping was fast too."
4,Happy with purchase,I'm happy with my purchase. The mats are nice to wrap around food containers and bottles so the cold surrounds them. They are lighter than the typical blue ice blocks. The only reason I didn't give them a rating of 5 is that I think they are easy to puncture if they get poked or rub to hard against things. The pros are greater than the cons and I would purchase them again.
2,Soggy Sandwiches,"The mats were great at keeping soda cold, but when it came to sandwiches they still got soggy."
4,great short story,"GREAT BOOK...THIS SHORT STORIE DESERVES TO BE MADE INTO A FEATURE FILM...IT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL. JSUT LIKE MOST OF THE SHORT STORIES FROM THE NIGHT SHIFT COLLECTION, QUITTERS INC GIVES THE READER A NICE CHANGE OF PACE ALWAYS UTILIZING KING'S OWN SINGULAR STYLE...I RECOMMEND THIS COMPILATION OF SHORT STORIES TO BE READ BY READERS WHO ARE NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH KINGS STYLE...."
4,Part of 1983 movie,"This story has stayed with me ever since I first was exposed to it at the movies in 1985. It is one of three short stories within 'Stephen King's Cat's Eye', with James Woods playing 'Dick' in the Quitters, Inc segment. As this particular story had such an effect on me, it was a challenge to not imagine James Woods while listening to Eric Roberts. Fortunately, Eric Roberts did a great job, and allowed me to be absorbed by this wonderfully twisted story again!"
3,"Nicely written, but a bit too predictable.","Quitters, Inc. was the first audio book I'd listened to by Stephen King. Eric Roberts does an execellent job of narrating the story. I liked the flow of the story and the ambiguity at the first of the novel...it reminded me of the movie, ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas. The plot however, I found predictable. From the moment the main character sat down to talk to Mr.Donatti,and asked if he loved his wife, I knew the rest of the story. I wish there had been more character development but I suppose that isn't possible in such a short story. Nicely written but I would have enjoyed more suspence. I did expect Mr. Morrison to slip up a bit more. The short story that stuck with me for over 20 years was ""Survivor Type"" by Stephen King. It had gore and a comedic darkness."
5,"Excelente libro, creo que es único","Tuve la suerte de ser uno de los primeros en poder leer esta obra y me parece sumamente interesante. Sobre la violencia familiar he encontrado muchos trabajos sobre sociologia o psicologia, pero este es el primero que enfoca el problema desde un punto de vista juridico. Y aunque yo no soy abogado me parecio muy entendible y ponde el dedo en la herida. Ojala se escriban muchas obras como esta para tratar de evitar que se cometan conductas tan graves para la familia."
2,It Will Do,Advanced Tactical Fighters is an okay book.Oh sure it has pictures and all but not very many planes.Some planes go on with facts that don't have to be in there for a few pages which makes it so there are'nt many planes.The pictures in it are'nt very good either.If you just want a book that does'nt show many planes this is the one.Not a good book for a report or anything but it's still pretty good book.It is certainly not a reference book but if you just want to take a quik glance at a fighter it will do.
3,Not bad but good information,This book contain good information about lots of jet fighter. It's good for those people who like to know something technical about the planes. But it does not have any good pictures & it's too small. It's very handy if you want to search something technical about some planes which I find it very easy to look for.
2,boring,I usually love reading True Crime stories but this one was a slow read. I wouldn't recommend it. I removed it from my kindle without even finishing it.
1,Zzzzzzzz,"Hugely boring, not at all well written. Even if it is for free don't waste your time. Very short & nothing new or novel about it."
1,Boring.,"Not what you would expect. It is written in the time of the original era of the crime, so old English to some French, to modern English, not a book worth reading at all unless you are a law student with a lot of down time...."
3,A rough read,"I'm one of those who have read true crime books for years. This is one of those books that was rough to trudge through. I rarely give bad reviews so I thought I'd meet in the middle. It wasn't all that bad, but it wasn't great either."
1,Worse Than Bad,"Did not get beyond the first crime. It was not the crime itself, but the writing. A first grader could have done better. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
1,ugh,"I agree with what some others have said... this book, in my opinion, just wasn't written well. There are true crime books written with flair and then there are true crime books that are like literally reading a case file. Names, dates, deeds, facts, no feel of a story at all. I can see why some people would be able to enjoy it, but fair warning, this is no Anne Rule type crime book... like I said, reads like a file. Didn't get past the first few ""chapters"" =/"
1,bad,no wonder this book was free. read the first two stories and started the 3rd but was extremely bored and could not read any more. I have been reading true crime stories for 30 years and have read some boring stories but these are by far the most boring. Dont waste your time.
1,Poor choice,"I was not expecting stories from long ago, so I was pretty disappointed in this book. I would not recommend it."
4,I always get what I want...,"From Back Cover - Adam Thornton's words struck fear into Natalie's heart. For the survival of her modeling agency depended on keeping him and his company happy. Her own sister - Thornton's Cosmetics' Dream Girl - had put her firm in jeapardy. And Adam Thornton, her irate client, was not a man to be trifled with. Ruthless in business, he was also dangerous to love, as Natalie discovered. For what he wanted most of all was Natalie - as his mistress!"
2,Poor research produces fatal flaw in storyline,"Harold Coyle usually does a fine job writing and researching his stories. Up until this latest product, I enjoyed seeing the improving quality of his stories. More than Courage however does not reflect a Special Forces A-team. The members of a real team have much more experience then reflected in Coyle's characters. The inclusion of Specialist and an inexperienced officer as part of the team goes beyond fiction. He could have accurately reflected an A-team and still tracked along the basic plot. I recommend passing on this book and hope his next one is better."
3,Annoying,"The author knows his stuff, but disappoints when, after introducing characters we care about, has them disappear without detail and off-stage."
1,Skip it,"I literally could not finish this book; I stopped after exactly 100 pages.There were too many technical flaws that anybody familiar with the US military and its special operations forces would be able to point out. I felt like I was reading a Hollywood manuscript...that's how technically inaccurate it was.Sorry, but when it comes to military books, suspension of belief is not in my vernacular. The author obviously did very little research in writing this book. His editor should also be ashamed as I found a couple of proofreading errors within the 100 pages that I read.Although I feel bad for giving this book a review without even having read the whole book, I cannot bring myself to read a book on military fiction that is technically inaccurate with proofreading errors.I suggest the author research his material better next time."
2,Inaccuracies ruin a good storyline,"I have enjoyed Coyle's books in the past. However, I found too many technical flaws in this story to really get into it. From the start, the make-up and equipment of an ODA (Special Forces 'A' team) are completely incorrect. You will not find an ODA run by a junior liuetenant or captain, nor with Spec-4s as operators. The senior NCO is likely to be an E8 (master or first sergeant) and the other members will be E6s and 7s. Even to such trivial things as the terminology of the M-2 machine gun. It's a ""Ma Deuce"", not a ""Ma Two"". Much as I tried to just go with the story, I seemed to find myself saying ""Well, that's wrong"" about every other paragraph."
2,Did Coyle Actually Write This?,I am a huge fan of Harold Coyle but this book reminds me of the junk books that Tom Clancy continues to spew out. I find it hard to believe that Coyle even wrote this! There is little character development and the story line is sporadic at best. Getting thru the first 100 pages can be mind numbing and doesn't get much better after that. This book is a huge disappointment for the Coyle fan and one would hope that whom ever ghosted this book for him goes away and he once again puts pen to paper. Don't waste your money on this unless you plan on using it to start a fire.
2,More Than Courage,"I have read almost all of Harold Coyle's books and have always looked forward to them. This book was a tremendous disappointment.It contains too many technical errors and improbabilities. The Land Warrior system really was an underplayed segue within the story, and the two system experts were both exposed to combat. In addition, the editing job was a disaster. I found four errors, and I am sure there are more."
5,"Solid product, good price","I have used this socket set with my impact wrench several times. No problems so far. Easy to read, large text showing socket sizes."
3,Second time's the charm?,"Bought this watch from a local department store in Boston, and had the crystal shatter within 4 days of purchse. [...] replaced it without question, and there hasn't been a problem yet. Overall, I love the watch. Thin, lightweight and fashionable."
2,Flawed design - make your own jewelry? Fix it yourself.,"I agree with the prior reviewer who said the rubber bands start breaking. I had it about a month and wore it nearly every day when I noticed that the rubber bands which were at first neatly concealed, began to shred and break - thus poking through between the bands which make up this otherwise charming piece.Also please note that it is 'silver tone' - NOT sterling, so it also tarnishes easily and can cause discoloration of skin in metal sensitive wearers (like myself).I stopped wearing it due to the unsightly rubber strings poking through. I plan to visit a craft store for some jewelry making supplies to salvage it since I do love the sentiment and quaint charm of the piece nonetheless."
1,Terrible,"It's came all scratched, hardly as shiny as the picture, which was probably brightened to white out the scratches. Also, the bracelet is 2.25 inches in diameter (TINY)...held together by rubberbands. Dont get this~~By the way, I think all those people below this comment with the ""Real Name"" thing are all just BSing as in none of them actually bought it.Edit: Even the gift box I ordered it in is scratched...sigh.."
5,Great ideas for quality projects,"We borrowed this book from the library and liked it so much that I decided to buy it. It has lovely photography which makes each project very appealing. The instructions are very easy to follow. I disagree with the review that said the materials are hard to find, but you will need some basic tools (drill, hacksaw, utility knife, needle and thread) for some projects. Also, I would not recommend this book to someone without a backyard. It is not kitchen table science, but really requires access to the outdoors."
5,Great Projects,I received the book only a few days after I ordered it. It was in perfect condition. It has great ideas for science projects that are interesting and go along with the science curriculum that kids are learning in school. I have already picked out several projects to make for the Science Fair.
1,Why would anyone buy this?,"This audio version, read by Debra Lynn, is FREE at Librivox.com. Martin Chuzzlewit is in the public domain and volunteers at Librivox.com have created a free audio recording for anyone who wants to download it. That is all this is. The same free mp3 files are available via a number of other sites too. So if you buy this, you are basically paying $19.00 to someone who has taken these free files and put them on an MP3 CD for you. If you are tech-savvy enough to know what to do with an MP3 CD (it won't play on most ordinary CD players, only MP3 CD players), you probably also know how to download a file from a web site. So why buy it?More importantly, Amazon sells a professionally recorded version of this book (with all apologies, it's better than the Librivox version) at a lower price. See this version:Martin Chuzzlewit. A better narration at less expense. That is what I would choose."
2,Song of Scheherazade,"One of my favorite films from the '40's. Unfortunately, the Portugese subtitles, which I couldn't turn off, are very annoying. The product description doesn't mention the subtitles."
5,Song Of Scheherazade,"Song of Scheherazade is one of the best movies that I haveever seen. A great cast. Jean Peirre Amount is one of myfavorite actor. I would love to have all the movies he made inthe 40's and 50's, in English. Getting back to the movie.Eve Arden, Brian Donlevy, Yvonne DeCarlo were supurb. I have lost count ofhow many times that I have watched it. It is just a wonderful and powerfulmovie. I feel so lucky to have been able to purchase it. The color justgreat.Plina"
5,Worthy sampler of an evolving area,"A great overview of the intersections of games, linear stories, and interactive artworks. This book almost inevitably leaves you with a richer perspective, because the range of articles (the uses of voice synthesizers to the Sims) makes it unlikely that you are familiar with all the terrain. The commentary discussions parallel to the main text give a feeling like chatting with your smart friends about some brilliant lecture you just saw. Thought provoking and fun."
2,YAWN!,"Written like a clinical textbook that you must force yourself to read. There is nothing adventurous, enticing, or even entertaining about the writing in this book. It has a lot of information and anecdotal commentary, but it is a chore to read and not useful in group rehab sessions."
1,"GREAT RESOURCE, FLAWED COPY,DON'T BUY USED","I bought this in the used section to calculate currents in the San Juan Islands and it worked very well [coupled with the current Washburn Tables booklet] until I discovered it was missing a page/chart defeating the whole point of using it. I have replaced it with a new, spiral bound version which I would recommend."
3,frustrating,Gorgeous heavy pans very even browning. Darn near impossible to get out of the pan in one piece. Have tried these pans four times once with PAM once with PAM and flour Once with grease and Once with Grease and flour and have never managed to get more than one out all in one piece. Maybe better luck with professional baking spray that combines grease and flour? Hope to get these to work they are so pretty and are a really nice size
5,Baker's Joy,"Tray Baker's Joy non-stick spray with the Nordicware. I have the Nordicware teacake mold, and Baker's Joy does a fabulous job with all the tiny intricate details."
2,Better than toast....Barely!,"I, being a man of middle age resent being referred to as a grandaughter. In my seasoned years, I've grown accustomed to old men bear-baiting me. Only to have them disappoint in the end."
4,Enjoyable Grand Funk album,"Grand Funk / Closer To Home: ""I'm Your Captain"" is clearly the best track on the album. The rest of the album can hardly be called classic, but it IS enjoyable. I like it, so I give it four stars."
4,Please Play Loudly,"I was over a friend's house and she put a CD on and I had no clue what band it was. I soon found myself listening to the songs and becoming enthralled at the quality of the sound from not only the CD, but the music itself which was just amazing.After listening to the entire CD I decided to buy it even though I had never even heard of the band before (that's how good it was). I bought it at B&N and listened to it at least 2 times every day for about 2 months. If someone is interested in classic rock with early heavy metal and blues influences, this is the CD for you. The live bonus tracks are great, especially the sound and energy of the crowd.However, the three tracks of Mean Mistreater are a little excessive, and after a while I found myself skipping over the re-mix and the live version."
5,"Great Grand Funk Railroad Album, Even Better With Remastering","CLOSER TO HOME is a great Grand Funk Railroad album that's now even better with warm, crisp, thick remastering. Many of the songs here, including the Top 40 single ""I'm Your Captain/Closer To Home"" and ""Aimless Lady"", have become standards on such classic rock stations as WPYX, KGON, WCSX, KISM, WQUS, WCMF, WGRF, KZOK, KLPX, KFEG, WPDH, KUFX/KUZX, KQMT, KXPT, KVRV, KOZZ, and many others. Even lesser known songs such as ""Sin's A Good Man's Brother"" sound a clarion call for peace, love, and understanding that even today might inspire a high school boy not to reject an ordinary girl in favor of the cheerleading captain. Moreover, the fact that past and present members have supported recent efforts to free Americans jailed abroad on false charges makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
4,"For three musicians and three chords, this is tops",The songs on this album are hot and heavy with a driving bass rythem. Mark Farner simple but elegant lead lines blend effortlessly into the driving melodies of the tunes. Anyone into the early 70s rock scene must have this album in their collection.
4,Closer to Home ~ Grand Funk Railroad,HeyI have been looking for this album for the last 20 years.Whenever radio stations played the title song i could nevercatch the name of the album. Absolutely no regrets.It feltLike i was a kid again and thanks to Amason i now own a copy.For classic rock lovers this is a very good addition to anycollection.hope you enjoy it!
2,I Don't Know,"Tinny and hard to digest, the lone worthy track , ( I'm Getting ) Closer to my Home, is cool enough for me to give it 2 stars. It's a dreamy song with special sounds like water splashing. If it wasn't so hollow, and the production values better, it would probably be a song still heard on radio and TV. Otherwise, not much else here."
1,Recognized accreditation is important!,"....and unfortunately the author fails to recognize that. When I saw that Kennedy-Western University was included in this book, I knew there was trouble. KWU is an unaccredited school that has maintained campuses (Mail Boxes, Etc. locations, actually) in Hawaii, Idaho, and now Wyoming. Although the school is actually RUN from California, it is not allowed to enroll students living in California.Red Alert, folks! If this is indicative of the research that went into the rest of the book, I'm frightened. There are a number of other guides available (Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, Campus Free College Degrees, and Peterson's Guide To Distance Learning) that do their homework and offer many convenient, legitimately accredited options for the nontraditional and distance learner."
3,this book needs serious editing,"i agree with some of the other reviewers that moon's book is difficult and frustrating to read. on one hand it provides some interesting and educational information on scientology, the oto, jack parsons and aliester crowley. personally, i don't believe israel regardie murdered crowley, but that is only my opinion. what i dislike about the book is the stretches of fiction he mixes into the matter. there is this ongoing parallel universe story that really doesn't tie into the book at all. besides, for me, it's not even an interesting or entertaining story. if all the fiction would have been edited out, and this was a strait forward look at mystical systems, this would have been an excellent read. but for it's disorganization and superfluous material, i give it 3 stars."
1,Not Moon's best,"Being a fan of the Montauk Project books, I looked forward to reading this.There are some fairly interesting moments, but all bets are off when Moon fanatically ""legitimizes"" tall tales from shady hoaxer, Joseph Matheny. To publicly speak of Matheny with the same reverence as figures such as Parsons, Dee and Regardie is disingenuous and patronizing. To suggest that ""Ong's Hat"" and the ""Metamachine"" are anything more than fairy-tales casts suspicion on the entire body of work.Suffice it to say, I was disappointed in the writing, but even more so that he clearly did not check his facts.I don't know yet if I will write Moon off completely - everybody has their bad days. I will probably read his next book to see if he is back on his game."
4,Who Can Resist Dr. Einstein?,"Centainly not confined to accolades about Dr. Einstein's genius, but an entertaining insight into his sense of humor, his practical side, his views on education, of God, of war, and human nature, all salted with irreverent humor,critical analysis,and refreshing self-deprication. A multifarious man, Einestein's commentaries on life are surprising and colored. A great gift book.A good companion book: Albert Einstein, Ideas and Opinions, 1982 Crown Publishing."
4,Well Worth It,"The book arrived on shelves 10 or 12 days ago to little or no fanfare, and mores the pity. It is an inspiring story of an improbable hero and the many, MANY tests and challenges he has faced both on and off the wrestling mat. It is also the story of an unassuming, everyday kinda guy who faced adversity in many forms and always came out on top because of his belief in the idea that you never stop trying until you win. For any self-respecting wrestler or wrestling fan, this is a must-have. For the rest of the world, well, the writing style and prose pose no particular threat to Messer Hemingway or Faulkner's standing in the literary world, but that's part of what makes it such a fun and interesting read. It is a great story and great read. Go buy it. A few more Rulon Gardner's and the world would be a much better place."
4,Combat Conditioning Helps,"I have suffered from problems with my back for some time due to injuries. I purchased Combat Conditioning in order to learn exercises to strengthen my back muscles, hopefully eliminating some of my problems. Within one week after starting, I could already tell a difference. Most of the pain in my lower back has disappeared, and now I am moving on to my upper back."
2,Combat Ripoff,"If you go to the website of the author, you will get truly pumped up to buy this book. It is all marketing and you have just bought snake oil. He focuses on three exercises that are not new or his own (to his credit Matt didn't take credit for them). They are hindu squats, hindu pushups, and the neck bridge. The other exercises in the book are ones you probably did in grade or high school. His tapes are not any better. His book then has all of the garbage that you shouldn't buy as advertisements in the back. The exercises are fine, but the book is overpriced and I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Wise foundation,"Although written somewhat complicated, this book offers detailed, well-researched information on composting and organic farming in general. Great book."
2,p u,"i didn't like the way this product smelled at all, it did in fact work to take of the hollisters spray adhesive, but left me and the entire house smelling like an auto shop or worse. based on this i wouldnt use it again, just threw some out actually so that it wouldn't accidently get opened. again it did work, but i don't recommend its use, i had a skin reaction also, all better now thanx, h"
4,Good Ol' Days,"This is the first book I've read by Mrs. Butler, wanted to read ""The Night Before Thirty"", but never got around to it; I picked up this book, having no clue what it was about(the cover was missing). I just started reading and found myself totally caught-up in Lanita's story. This book was so well written and so interesting from the 1st page, it just draws you in. I loved the main character and loved reading her story, the ups and downs, highs and lows; Being around the same age as Lanita, I could totally relate to some of her experiences and it was fun reminicing on the good old days, the fun I had as a child, the people I've met; Very Good Read, Loved It....... Definately will be picking up other titles by this author."
3,Just Okay...,"I picked up this book because I have read Ms. Butler's other three novels. While I think those novels were great, this one was just okay. I didn't care for the characters to much in the story because they all seemed to lack personality. The one thing I did like, but I felt she over used too much was the historical backdrop. It was cool up to a point, but then it just became irritating. This is definitley not her best writing, but I am looking forward to the next one."
2,You get what you pay for,"This lens in just ok. It is a little soft at the edges and at wide apertures. After using it for a few months I sold it to buy a Canon 17-40 f/4 L. The Canon is a stop slower and a couple hundred dollars more, but the images are sharper and it is weather sealed. I would invest the extra money in a Canon lens."
4,One of the best Sigma lenses,"Quite a sharp lens, did some very good shots until I replaced it with Canon 16-35 f/2.8. Overall I was very happy with it, the tiny little problem it is a very fragile lens (like most of Sigma lenses), and it needs a very special treatment, also the size of the filter is very big, makes it very expensive to buy 82mm C-PL for example."
2,Not as sharp as I'd like,"I love being able to get wide angle shots, and I had high hopes for this lens. However, I have yet to get a crisp, sharp image out of it. I've had it on both auto focus and manual focus, on a tripod using a remote shutter release and mirror lockup, and still only ever get slightly hazy or blurry pictures. I'm not sure if I have a bad unit, or it's a problem with the design, or I'm just not using it right. And, alas, it's too late to send the lens back."
2,Actual product doesn't look as good as the picture,"I purchased this product to replace the DLO Action Jacket Protective jacket for iPod shuffle that I purchased with my Ipod Shuffle Gen2 since its velcro strap was rubbing my arms raw after much use.I was extremely disappointed when I received this product. The velcros were very visible and shabby-looking. And when you use the extension band on it so you can wear it on your upperarm, it looks more ugly. The extension band looks like an afterthought expecially since the extension band that came with mine wasn't even the same color are the band itself (the main band was charcoal gray and the extension band was light gray, silver almost).Sad to say, I don't think I will actually be using this thing."
5,"I've used them for years, soft, work great.",I've used this particular brand for all my saxes and couldn't be happier with the product. I highly recommend them.
5,Tenor sax neck saver,I needed this item to protect my investment in a new tenor saxophone. It does the job and I have no complaints.
1,Flaky connections - don't buy these!,"I don't tend to be picky about headphones or speakers, but these are terrible. The electrical connection at the plug is flaky, so you only get sound in one ear or the other (you get to choose by wiggling the cable at the point near the plug)."
1,"I really disliked this book, very disappointing","I am a HUGE Sanders fan but this book left me cold, I kept reading hoping it would improve but it never did and was just dreadful (IMO) all the through. I found it depressing and boring and just hopeless; I'll stick to Delaney and McNally and leave Marlow to others."
3,sog sheath,"I just recived my new Sog seal pup through Amazon today ... the knive is great, it is as I expected .. The kydex sheath however is extremly disapointing , the knive fits loose , I wouldn't want something that you had to strugle to pull out of the sheath , but the only thing keeping it from falling out of the sheath is the strap with metal snap ... it's to bad such a good knive comes with such a poor sheath ...I agree with Jonathon100 % , I can't believe they didn't notice this before they started boxing the knive and sheath together and presenting them as a proper package ..."
4,Singing Sammy Birthday Cake,"This is my second Singing Sammy and it makes it to every birthday party I attend. Everyone who sees it enjoys it and ask where they can get one. Sammy is paired with the ""Dancing Cake"" which is not as lively at Sammy, and the singing Birthday Hat, and what a hoot when they are all playing at the same time.....This is a got to have for your birthday enjoyment. And I not taking about birthdays for kids....senior adults have fun too!"
5,equally comical and touching,"i saw this doc at a festival in madison, wisconsin, and happily joined the crowd in a standing ovation. the subjects are varied, ranging from slightly deranged to wholly endearing, but i cheered for each and every one. competition docs seem increasingly common, but this one stands out, given that to set a guinness world record, one essentially competes against the planet's entire population. definitely on par with MAKE BELIEVE and KING OF KONG - and a good lesson in successful filmmaking on a budget. the director said it took him five years. hoping the next one comes sooner!"
3,just ok,ok looking frame. the glass is definitely the worst part. even after windex-ing it it is still hazy. would only recommend is you just need a cheap frame
3,Khubilai the Great.,"Rossabi dispels the notions that the Mongol horsemen that conquered half the world were barbarians. He details Khubilai's life and how as a grandson of the great Genghis, he expected to someday be one of the ruling princes of the Mongol Empire. Khubilai's rule was not anticipated. He had to battle his brother for the throne. However, when he became a great Khan, he conquered most of China, and extended his influence over a large chunk of Asia. He was a consensus ruler, taking people from all ethnicities. He took the best ideas from all and used them in governing his empire. Other than some military setbacks in Japan and Java, his influence was great.This is dry reading at times. The author is an academic, and this is a serious academic work. The author wrote an book detailing all the knowledge we have of Khubilai. However, this book is not for everyone.A detailed read."
3,This book was ok,"Khubilai Khan was the first of the Mongol rulers to make the transition from nomadic conqueror of the steppes to effective ruler of a sedentary society. His reign in China witnessed the construction of a capital city, the development of a new legal code, and court patronage of the arts, science, and medicine. He expedited and encouraged travel in his territories: Asian goods reached Europe along the caravan trails, and the ensuing European demand for these products eventually inspired the search for the sea route to Asia."
2,Wrong picture?,"You're selling a tool holder, but you have a watch pictured? People are going to be upset, if they buy the watch in the picture for $15, and get a tool organizer. False advertising. Please change the picture. :)"
5,Amazing. South Korea cinema is too notch,Wow. I saw Safe House for Hollywood one night and the Yellow Sea the next. Yellow Sea blew it away
3,"review of ""The Yellow Sea""","This movie was well worth watching. There was a lot of violence in it, but there was a definite plot that made the viewer care about the fate of the main character. The educational value of the film alone made it worth watching, for me. I had no idea that the people in this part of the world had to live this way. There were rich people who lived comfortably, but there didn't seem to be much of a middle class, and most people who had jobs lived meagerly. But they still wanted the same things that most people want. They had framed photographs of their weddings, complete with as many fashionable and nice clothes as they could manage. They decorated their homes with as much comfort as they could. Almost nobody of the main character's income level had a car. That would be a luxury. Their streets were often unpaved, their clothes cheap, their opportunities limited."
4,It was interesting,"I liked it. I found very creative and interesting. I was never bored. Great work, Paul! :) I highly recommend it."
4,4.7,"No fillers here! Kreator's best. Excellent production and mix! Betrayer, Some pain Will Last, and the absolutely awesome Don't Trust! There are no bad songs here. pure Kreator thrash that was once on Sony records (believe it or not they had a major deal for a while). This cd is up there with 'Reign in Blood' as one of the best thrash cds ever! No BS!The reviewers aren't exaggerating. this is great."
5,It's been too long my love,"Had this on cassette, now on cd:) Hooks with speed and I've always felt that Keator boaderlined on Death Metal, most because of the singer. He has a raspy screamy voice. These guys are just fast and catchy. This album and I guess Terrible Certainty are treats to behold. Other reviewers had mentioned this album with Reign in Blood, and I couldn't agree more. Flys under the radar. I feel that the singer might not be for everyone. Be sure to listen to samples. Highly recommended if you want classic thrash."
1,Do you want to know about cave exploration????,"I am a big fan of romance, esp. Elizabeth Lowell, BUT, what a disappointment. If you are into cave exploration, learning the ""lingo"" of climbing, what to wear, and how to describe the inside of a cave, then this is the book for you. I bought the unabridged audio and after the first tape, it was hard not to hit the eject button on the second one. The audio could have been 2 tapes instead of 6, if you left out the cave explorations. The characters were constantly having thoughts about their past, but would not tell each other how they felt. This kept getting old. Give Elizabeth Lowell another try, but I would definitely skip this one."
1,Thoroughly disappointed,"I listened to the unabridged audio tape of this book and was thoroughly disappointed. The author spent so much time and too much focus on cave exploration and not enough time on the relationship of the 2 main characters. I was bored after the first cassette, but I tried to continue listening to the remaining 5. After the 3rd, I gave up. Unless cave exploration is your hobby and you have a passing interest in romance novels, I advise you to take a pass on this book."
2,Dragged out and kind of silly!,"If you have read Elizabeth Lowell's books before you kind of know what to expect (crossed lovers, misunderstandings) but this book seriously drags out the miscommunication and the whole ""he loves me/ he loves me not"" situations. I skipped trough about a third of the book, I felt so many chapters were just fillers and didn't really add to the plot or development of the characters. Towards the end they have supposedly cleared all their misunderstandings, yet they're still fighting about the past (what?). I guess if you really want to read it, look for it at your local library."
2,Not Lowell's best,"Though I'm often a fan of Elizabeth Lowell, this wasn't one of my favorites. Much of the plot revolves around caving, and Lowell obviously did her research. However, she included so much detail - such as a description of every item they packed for a caving trip - that the story often dragged and at times I resorted to skimming. There is also an awful lot of blame and moping about a past misunderstanding, and often I wanted to yell at the characters, ""Just talk about it already!"" Real people might behave as foolishly, and the continued misunderstanding is necessary for the plot, but it's a problem when most of the secondary characters are more likable than the main characters."
2,Ugh... pick another Lowell,"The two charcters hated each other. They were so mean and nasty. It just wasn't enjoyable. I really like Elizabeth Lowell, but this was a disappointment. Pick another one."
1,Not This Time,I didn't know this was a re-write till I read some of the other reviews. I always look in the front to find the publish date and it seemed current. I haven't finished it yet but I got to say I got tired of being beat over the head with the alleged abortion issue. Lowell must have mentioned it at least 50 times in the first 100 pages. THREE times on one page. I got the message already! The caving doesn't sound interesting to me at all. I will stay above ground thank you.
3,Just ok - pick another Lowell book,"I really like Elizabeth Lowell, but this is one of her weaker efforts. It's pretty boring. Lots of anger and miscommunication. Not enough honesty. Pick another Lowell book to read - she has lots. Some of the caving info was interesting, but way too much of it. I skipped whole pages."
2,Disappointing!!,"What a waste of my time and money. I felt nothing for the plot or characters. I know Elizabeth can write compelling stories, but lately... I think she needs to take a break to get her punch back."
2,Disapointing!!,"What a waste of my time and money. I felt nothing for the plot or characters. I know Elizabeth can write compelling stories, but lately... I think she needs to take a break to get her punch back."
3,"Racer is a joke, the helicopter thing is cool, rocket ballons were most favored","So - three different balloons, 3 different options. The ""rocket balloon"" is the super-long kind that you inflate with the included pump. Those were the favorite - they shoot up in the air or just hit something and do nothing as they deflate. My niece and nephew loved it though. They had a hard time inflating them (ages 5 and 6) but they still thought they were hilarious. The car thing was a joke - they couldn't inflate the balloon too well and even when I could, the car is too light and doesn't go far or move at all. The helicopter thing was the most cool, I thought, but again the kids had a hard time inflating the balloons. I'd say for the price, it's a good amount of fun. Something different for the kids to play with indoors from time to time."
2,Cheaply built,"My son liked blowing up the balloons, that's about all it's good for. The cars don't go straight. Quality is like cheapo dollar store."
5,hit with the grandchildren,"We heard about this toy from friends whose grandchildren had loved it,so we got it for ours. It has multiple parts to create different scenarios to show the propelling of the varied vehicles. It's safe and really fun indoors or out."
1,not easy to set,"its impossible to set up the balloon and move the vehicle.overall, its not a toy for kids to play with !"
3,great fun,"Got it for my 6 year old son's birthday party ,the rocket balloons were a great hit but the balloon powered vehicles were a bit bland, the helicopter was good but didnt last long at all, but was still better then the car!!!"
1,"This is NOT ""The Sun Came Out""!","This digital video is *only* the concert film of the 2001 ""7 Worlds Collide"" concert, which is included on the physical DVD of the documentary ""The Sun Came Out,"" which chronicles the production of the 2009 followup concert and album, which features some of the same musicians, and some new ones.Don't get me wrong, it's nice to have the old concert movie, but I purchased this to get the newly-released documentary film. I will post a positive review of *that* film once I'm actually able to *watch* it. Amazon, fix this."
1,Poor sound quality,I think they were in a tin can when they recorded this cd. It is really poor quality and doesn't do justice to Chuck Berry.
1,Unhappy!,The only thing I could get this to pair with is my cell phone. MY OSX comnputers can see the headset but says it doesnt offer any services. Even after I bought a Bluetooth dongle with the l.2. Headset is a little too small for my head. Radio reception is pretty horrible. Never invested in the memory necessary for MP3 play.
2,Disappointing,"This book attempts to cover culture in ALL of the countries of the ""far east"", and in doing so has no depth or substance on any one topic. It also has no suggestions for further reading if you are intrigued by a particular topic. A much better book along these lines is the JAPANESE POP CATALOG which does contain fascinating detail, though admittedly it ""only"" covers japan."
3,more trendy garbage from this stupid magazine,"this magazine is so bad and white washed. i can see it now: hip city dwellers invite friends over, friends look on covvee table and see EST, and say oooh! how interesting! i love asian culture! i love hong kong films and mao suits! what a load of garbage. i feel sorry for all you asian hipsters who are victim to this whole asian fetish thing. dont you remember the racism of your childhood?"
1,My Disappointing Introduction To Bad Boys Blue,"I have downloaded various Bad Boys Blue songs over the past few months trying to decipher their exact sound. I have heard that they are a group from the 1980's, so I was a little sketchy about them as I hate '80s music. However, after hearing some of their excellent songs like THE POWER OF THE NIGHT and SAVE YOUR LOVE '99, I was sure that they could not make a bad song. So, without hesitation I purchased their newest album release, ""Tonite"". What I found was one good song (S.O.S) out of the entire album. The rest of the album's songs sound like regurgatated '80s tunes with absolutely no flair or orgininality. I was extrememly bummed when I realized that this album was a complete waste of my time and money. I am not dissing the ""Boys"", but this album was weak! I hope that in the future they can put a little more effort and enthusiasm in their projects. They have good stuff, but this album just a'int it."
5,Keep the albums coming,"First of all don't listen to the other reviewers, They don't know what they're saying. This album is great. There are 14 tracks and two of which are rap. I even found myself listening to the rap version even though I can't stand rap. The rest of the tracks are filled with great lyrics and high beats. Its true that track 1 and 3 are good but what the other reviewers didnt mention was that 4,5,6 and 7 are also as good. I have only listen to the cd for a day so I'm sure the rest of the songs will grow on me. Don't expect to buy a cd with only good songs if you're picky because that is not possible. This album has many great songs and yes there are some average ones. I said average not bad. I have been a fan since the early 90s and will continue to be one. As long as John is the lead singer, my support will alway be with them."
5,A Superb Compilation,"If you've ever wondered why so many other pop singers of the 20th Century expressed their debt to Bing Crosby you should listen to this album. While much of his earliest work seems still to suffer from the technical short-comings of the period in which it was recorded and much of the later stuff is hard to take because of the lackluster arrangements, all of that is transcended here. As much care has gone into the arranging as Frank Sinatra always demanded on his recordings. And Mr Crosby's voice is at the same time strong and nuanced. There is a lot here, not the songs you most commonly associate with Bing Crosby, maybe, but that seems to be all to the good, because, to my mind, he demonstrates just how well he could interpret both the American Songbook and a few things beyond it and you get the idea, as you listen, that this singer was for the ages, and he was."
5,classic lines with the elegance of platinum,I bought the champagne flutes and the iced beverage glasses in this style and I love them! They complement my Mikasa Parchment china SO well and are neutral enough to go with plain white dishes (and even Corningware French White with the vertical lines) and the iced beverage glasses are great with casual dinnerware too!...Of course the reviewer before me would be disappointed if she expected Waterford crystal quality for nine bucks but that's just silly! It's a great quality product for the price and I'm very happy with it...Macy's usually charges twice the Amazon price
1,Not worth a dime,"Huge waste of money, the lace is garbage, tools are garbage, never use oil on a glove. There is nothing in this kit worth buying. there is nice lace on Ebay and always use Pecard's Leather care on your glove."
5,Great stuff.,"Does exactly what the directions say it will do. I'v hardly used any since purchasing and already see the results. Although I only use it on my legs, which for some reason don't tan as easily as the rest, I will never go back to the tanning booth again. Saving a ton of money each month. Worth the purchase for sure!"
5,It just works,"I used it 4 times in the 2 days before before New Yrs Eve and it totally worked. I even got a couple comments by people asking me if I'd been in Florida recently(I live in PA). It works fast, and it looks natural. The smell is a little unpleasant (to me anyway) but it's not a big deal and you're not going to be using this daily so you can live with it when you do use it."
4,Sunless Tanning,"I really like this product and it worked quickly. My only complaint is that I am looking for sunless tanning that will give me more brown than bronze. It works though, leaves a nice, streak-less effect, and if you want bronze - this is the one for you."
2,Not much of a tan,"I ordered this product because of the good reviews, however it just didn't work for me. Maybe I just don't have the right skin for it. I applied after showering and exfoliating but received very little if any color - i applied 1-2 times daily for 3 days with very little noticable tanning. It might work for some but it didn't for me."
1,There is NOTHING Gradual about this tan,"I am a very pale person, so I thought I would try this product as it clearly stated that it was to ""build a tan"", that it would not streak or turn you orange. WRONG!!!! There is NO WAY this gradually adds colour to your skin. I am BLOTCHY AND STREAKY AND ORANGE!!! Even the girls at the Tim Horton's drive through noticed how bad it was (it is so bad I am using drive-through because I wont get out of my car)I did everything I was supposed to, I used exfoliant made specifically by Neutrogena for pre-self tanner, I used a downward motion to apply the creme, I even let it dry properly,but having my arms and legs propped up and letting it airdry for 45 mins (although it says it dries in 5).It may work for those who are already dark, but 100% did not work on me properly."
2,when they say gradual...,"...they mean it. could barely notice any color change after two applications. so if subtle is what you're looking for, you won't be let down. just too subtle for me."
4,"Good System, but change your office software","This is a solid hardware system and most the software is fine. No complaints as far functionality and using CDs. No offense but not that many people use Word Perfect and Quattro Pro. So if you want a smooth transition of documents to other systems you will want Microsoft Office. Granted MS Office is overpriced for that convenience but still it is the most widely used. I realize HP is probably trying to keep their system cost down but sometimes a little additional cost is worth it. Since HP could buy MS software in quantity it would reduce the cost to the end user, us. I highly recommend HP give that some serious thought."
5,More Than Just THE CANTERBURY TALES.,"If you have any interest in Chaucer or The Canterbury Tales, then THE COMPLETE POETRY AND PROSE OF GEOFFREY CHAUCER is a volume that you must own. As the title says, this is the complete poetry and prose of Chaucer, written in the original Middle English. The Canterbury Tales and Chaucer's longer poems are relatively easier to find, but some of his other writings are more difficult to obtain, such as some of his shorter poems. This is one of the only collections that I know that includes all those works and in the original Middle English. The book is quality bound and the text includes some very useful introductions, footnotes, and commentaries. A great gift for any person who loves the work of Chaucer."
4,70's man,I bought this cd as a Christmas gift for my dad and he absolutely loves it. He was impressed with the number of hit songs on one cd. A great buy.
3,OK But Missing Many Songs And Pointless...,"first off this cd is missing lots of songs like, rock n roll all nite, black magic woman, takin care of buissness, aqualung, do you feel like we do, surrender, crocodile rock more than a feeling... the list goes on... so really buy this and some other complimation rock CDS and youll have all the essential ones but also buy the albums... pointless too really make another rock cd complimation songs already about a few hundred on amazon alone..."
5,Covering Era's,The Powerful thing about this Disc is that it Covers Different Era's.Again A Great Collection of Material that Reaches across Time Lines.From The Stylistics to Mint Condition.Classic Soulful Slow-Jams that only Get Better With Time.The Dells are Represented real well here with Stay In My Corner.
4,Retour de flame,Ce livre est essentiellement une réponse point par point aux attaques les plus courantes faites contre les souvrainistes. Norman Lester cherche à démontrer que si les québécois sont racistes le reste du Canada l'est aussi. La recherche de squellette dans le placard se joue donc dans les deux sens.
2,You get what you pay for,"These components are extremely low quality. I think I could snap this keyboard with my fingers. The mouse is a BALL mouse, if you can believe it. The speakers are tiny, lightweight and flimsy. I haven't checked the sound quality yet. Assuming they work my expectations are extremely low. What good can I say about this product? The connectors are PS2 which frees up USB ports. yay."
2,The New Great Depression,"For the first time in forever, I didn't thoroughly enjoy something I read. The book was too depressing for words. I mean, I understand that death isn't fun, but other books are written on death and they don't depress me like this one did. John Edward, stick to what you think you know-helping us to connect with our loved ones on the other side!"
4,Handy. Bit weak.,"Overall a great idea. Not a bad build quality at all, jaws line up neatly, due to the length of arms etc not a great deal of pressure at the tip so do not expect this to grip and be able to turn with any great torque at the tip but because of the design gets into very tight spots and can latch onto things in tight places to retrieve things dropped in awkward places, unhook electrical clips you can't otherwise reach etc etc. Pretty handy."
3,"The Sword (The General, Book V)","Mediocre ending to outstanding series. Every other book in this series I would give 5 stars to. This one was not too bad as a story, but as the climax of a 5 part series it was flat. It had essentially the same basic plot as the others (go to enemy, overcome obstacles, make brilliant tactical move, gain victory). The overcoming of the major problems and enemies the reader has been following for the entire series (untrusting ruler, corrupt and evil chancellor) are summed up with a few sentences at the end. What made this series outstanding is its combination of realistic warfare, politics, character development, history, and fantasy. The Sword essentially leaves out the politics and character development. As a next to last book in a series, The Sword would be fine, but it fails to wrap up the overall story in a satisfactory manner. Overall, however, The General is a must-read series for any military or SF fiction fan, and enjoyable for nearly everyone else."
5,good read,"Glad to be able to finally finish this series. I've read about everything David Drake has written. Need the new ones, now"
2,don't bother,I am replacing this iron. Tired of its constant dripping water everywhere. It does have a lot of steam but requires re-filling for each item. I've had it. Time for another iron - think I'll look for another brand this time.
5,Love the Rowenta,"I just generally love the Rowenta Power Glide (basically a smooth polished bottom)I'm not professional ""Ironer"" but this does make it easier and I will always look for Rowenta's."
2,monotony,"I have great expectations for Forthy Deuce. However, most of the songs are in the same aggressive tone with melodic refrains in between."
2,Not the right stuff for me,"I'm sorry, but i really didn't like this album. Although there is an interesting aproach to this ""new metal"" kinda thing (is a sort of Deftones style but more hard rock), the songs didn't fullfilled my taste. Anyway, i believe it's been a good thing of Richie to discover new muscial horizons, which is in fact, a typically Richie Kotzen thing to do. So, i respect that very much. If that's the pattern, then i'll just wait what musical challenge is next for Richie. That's all folks!PS: I would recomend this cd to any hard rocker, hehe."
5,A powerfully moving blend of lyrics and musicality,"Susan Ashton is one of the best artists in the world of contemporary Christian music. This CD is wonderful--Susan has a beautifully pure voice and pours the deep emotion of someone who has ""been there, done that"" into the lyrics of her songs. I never get tired of listening to her!"
5,Susan Ashton touches the heart,"I well remember the first time I heard Susan Ashton. I was in a Christian bookshop in Chelmsford, England, and this CD was playing. I was going through a tough time in my personal life. Then ""A rose is a rose"" came on. I just had to stop and listen to the whole track, wipe away a tear or two, and then buy the album there and then! This album is charged with truth and emotion, and I would challenge anyone to question the divine inspiration which runs through it.This is an album of the highest quality imaginable: beautifully crafted songs, a voice that reaches out and grabs you, and a team of musicians and technicians who know exactly how to get the best out of the two. I'd happily recommend this to anyone - of any religion or none."
4,"Just a ""disclaimer"" of sorts!","This is a wonderful album, but the Amazon review has one piece of info wrong - this was Susan's third solo album, not her debut. Her debut is called ""Wakened by the Wind"" and ""Angels of Mercy"" followed that. Terrific singer with the sense to pick strong songwriters. The opening two songs ""Summer Solstice"" and ""Waiting for Your Love to Come Down"" are worth the price of the CD alone."
4,Awesome Sockets,"These sockets are great. They are thinner walled than my older SK sockets and seem to have the same tough qualities. As i have stated in my other IR impact socket reviews, the only issue i have with these sockets is the finish. The black coating wears off depending on the amount of rubbing your sockets endure during use. Because these are not stamped the sizes will wear off making them partially unreadable. These, none the less, stand up to the quality of my tool truck sockets and ive yet to have an issue with them."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"Although the cover of this book is what convinced me to buy it, I was greatly disappointed with the contents. I thought it would contain at least a few ideas for decorating, but there wasn't anything like that inside. Gifts-in-a-jar recipes are a dime a dozen; I needed some inspiration to make them pretty to sell at an upcoming Christmas fair. Also, the paper is cheap looking and feeling. The money spent to publish this must have all gone into the cover!"
3,Perfect Mix - A Homemakers Gift,"While this little book was not what I expected, it has good recipes for mixes that do not have chemicals such as aluminum for preservation. The recipes are placed adjacent to the mix so they are easy to find and to use."
3,Worth it if only for Dressing Up,"I had ""Dressing Up"" on tape(from Radio) for some 20 years before I even knew who it was or what it was called (Thank's Google for your help). This Track has been (and still is) my number one favourite track of all time in my collection. The Drums, the Guitars and Martha's voice all come together to make this an Air Guitarist's dream. Thank god enough people appreciate the Motels so I could get it on CD at last. The other tracks don't quite make it but worth every penny (sorry - cent) for ""Dressing Up"" alone."
4,Good,This was my favorite eyeliner until they changed the formula. It seems like you have to go over the line a few times to make it look darker.
4,good but still asking for more,"For the price, this product stays on quite well all day and is easy to use. Withstands tears well. While not having to use a sharpener makes it quick to use, it also means the point is dull unless you use the small, awkward sharpener built in the end. So you end up using it dull or end up using the sharpener which defeats the no sharpener appeal. Would like someone to invent the self sharpening eyeliner that also keeps a sharp point."
3,No staying power on the waterline,"Revlon Colorstay may be a good eyeliner on the lashline, but it definitely does not stay on the waterline, which is where I like to use eyeliner. It seems to just disappear after about an hour. I will say that it is easy to apply & remove and goes on smoothly."
2,Disappointing print,This book is imperfectly printed. In this day and age it is unacceptable.If were easy to return and I didn't need it right away I would return it.The content is good and well composed.Some paragraphs are too light to read.
3,A good enough memoir,"After the enduring love affair I've had over the years with Burning Questions and Memoirs of An Ex-Prom Queen I have to say I expected more. More heart, more soul, more humor, in fact, more of a book than this rather dry recapturing of old memories. Not a bad book, just not a really good one, and as such, a disappointment."
2,Not a Good Enough Book,"Memoir is my favorite genre, but I found this memoir totally unengaging. Large doses of humor may have helped leaven this weighty prose. Halfway through, I just couldn't bring myself to care enough about the subjects to go further."
3,Okay to Read When There's Nothing Else to Do,"I bought this book because of a review I read in""Bust"" magazine, but I must say this book isn't really worth reading. I thought I might get something useful and insightful out of it since I just turned 18 and will be moving out of the house soon. Boy was I wrong. The entire story is about a woman who reviews her childhood and her parents. The only interesting thing is how she progresses from seeing her parents as just that--parents, designed to keep her caged in, to seeing them as real people with real desires, people who don't always get along and see eye to eye. I'd have to say, don't buy this book unless you're desperate."
3,sportline stopwatch,"I am a USDA Food Safety Inspector and work in a wet enviroment. We can't wear a wrist watch so I need one around my neck. I use the chronograph and I love that the time, day, date are all on one large display. The only thing I don't like so far is that I have to push the button twice to get to the chrono and four times to get back to the time."
2,Review of stopwatch,The watch is excellent but the battery went dead in less than a month. Normally a battery will last well over a year. I can only assume the watch has been sitting in storage for a long time. It would have been nice to get a fresh watch.
3,Big Shrimpy compacts down too much,"I like the exterior construction of my large nest bed, I am not happy with the Smartfill stuffing.It has lost its loft, and trying to wash it to clean it and restore its loft was disasterous and potentially dangerous.Many fibers were so sort that they flew everywhere, and clogged the lint trap on my dryer--creating a fire hazard. They also made it hard to breathe. And to top it off, it didn't improve the loft."
5,I like this one...,"First, I heard V6 because they sing the song Change The World, the theme song for Inu Yasha, the anime. And then, I love that song very very much, and then I tried to search for other songs by them in Napster (is it illegal?) and I love them. So, I decided to buy a CD of them, I bought the very best thing, and I think I like it... although I don't know any single word in japanese... I still like it. I think it's true, music is the language across culture, and I like V6."
3,Interesting variations,"Buyer beware-- until the recent 2-CD VOYAGES set, there really had been no actual RW ""Greatest Hits"" set-- even the one that had that title! This is another somewhat questionable package containing new 1993 recordings of 3 of Rick's most popular pieces-- but how many ways can you re-do a classic? Sadly, every version of ""Journey"" since the original has suffered for lack of its wonderful narration. On the other hand, I never tire of the growing number of ""Catherine Howard"" versions-- perhaps because the music reminds me of someone I know in my own life? Actually, the one delightful surprise of this album was Wakeman having the nerve to add LYRICS to ""Merlin The Magician""! You'll only hear them on THIS disc-- take that how you will."
1,Definitely Junk,"We have now gone through the second DM170 in 2 years. The first one was replaced just as the warranty expired, and now the new one they sent us has problems too. Leaking out of the sole plate and handle. Also, it just shuts off for some reason. You have to plug it in several times to reset it.Our 1st Rowenta (not one of our DM170's) also had this shutoff problem (of course Rowenta wanted us to pay the $45 repair charge on a $70 iron). Rowenta refused to replace it of course and also declined this second DM170 as being under warranty. This will be our LAST Rowenta product. When it works, it works great. Too many mornings my wife and I have had to change clothes due to the water spotting and fighting with it to turn back on.Why is it so hard to make something so simple not leak or have faulty wiring?"
1,JUNK!,"This is without a doubt the worst iron I have ever had. I wanted a really good iron that didn't spit or leak. Rowenta is priced at the top, so I felt assured ""you get what you pay for"". I couldn't have been more wrong. I can't even keep water in the reservoir. You pour it in, and start to iron, and the water just leaks out. What a mess! Writing to the manufacturer is of no help. I just bought this, and because their product is defective, I have to send it to their repair center, AT MY COST. What a rip off!!!"
1,Waste of money,"Don't buy this iron! I was suckered into thinking it would be a good idea to have an iron that didn't leak. Yeah, it doesn't leak alright, it doesn't steam either! It's anti-leaking design has made this iron one that puts out very little steam even at it's full steam setting. I constantly have to press the steam button (several times) to get sufficient amount of steam to iron my clothes. I wish I could return it but it's too late. Rowenta has some good irons, and I do recommend them, but this particular model just doesn't cut it (or should I say ""steam it"")."
5,The best dance track since into the groove.,"Three years later music still can rock the house mixed or not mixed. Madonna open the new decade with a bang!!!!, like she started the 1990's with dancing (vogue). Note music was last US commecial single to go platinum."
1,Fell apart,"Are you asking yourself, why are some HDMI cables very cheep and some very expensive?I asked myself the same question and decided to go mid-range to make sure I was getting a quality item. But what is quality? I was not sure until I saw what happened to this piece of crap.Keep in mind I plugged this HDMI cable into my TV (never used the cable before) and it literary fell apart. My TV signal went out the other day and to my surprise I saw this cable had disintegrated (please see pixs). Please keep in mind that I bought this April 2006 and may be I got my moneys worth but for it to fall apart is crazy.I will replace this with cheep one and cross my fingers."
2,Pricey for the length,"After seeing a wide range in the prices for HDMI cables, I did some research into why is it. Found out that these cables carry digital signals (0's and 1's), so no matter what kind of fancy name you add before this cable, its basic purpose is simple like a cat5 cable. Then I went ahead and bought the cheaper ones which are working perfectly fine. So, dont be fooled by the high price cables. There is no special sheilding &%*p in them. Its all misleading marketing. For this length of cable, I would pay maybe $5."
4,HDMI cable,not sure if actual AR HDMI cable(acoustic research). Did'nt have the AR intials stamped in the connectors. price was nice
2,Poor Consruction,The connector is easly seperated from the cable and as a result damaged beyond repair. The cable is heavy and when the connector is mated the weight of the cable puts pressure on the connector and the stress begings to seperate the connector from the cable.I had this failure happen with both cables. I recommend less expensive cables that meet minimum standards. This type of connector is available at less than half the price and works fine.
5,Great Deal,"Awesome cable for the money. As others have pointed out, an HDMI cable transmits a digital signal so there is no difference in the ""high"" end ones from cheaper ones. They all do the same thing and equally as well. This cable is excellent. If you but a more expensive one you're just paying for the name, which I guess is okay."
2,Works ok but can cause damage in the long run,"I've had these cables for about a couple of years and when I initially plugged them into my LG LCD 37"" and my PS3, they worked nicely. However, after 6 months I began to notice the signal would go out and I'd have to jiggle the cable to get it to work again. I realized that the weight of the cables were weighing on the HDMI ports of both my TV and PS3, loosening them. The cables would literally fall out of the port and I would have to position them just so in order to distribute the weight evenly. Eventually it came to the point where I couldn't start my PS3 up without jiggling the cables and repositioning them every five minutes to maintain a good signal. I ended up buying cheaper, more lightweight cables and am much happier for it."
2,"Overweight, stale, out of date","I have used the Lonely Planet guides in Asia, the Middle East, and in Europe. Lately, they seem to have lost their way. Originally, the LP guides were for people who had travelled at least a little bit before and needed some pointers to an area. The guides usually had some sort of walking tours in the cities they indicated. Their guides have become filled with useless colour photos of generic scenes, The quirky, fresh information has disappeared -- In the summer of 2004, I used the LP guides for both Portugal and Spain. I was traveling for about three months. I had been in both places before and had used a LP guide. The most recent guides are stale and minimally updated. They are also occassionally misleading; especially concerning food. Sadly, the LP guide to Portugal is not worth the weight that goes along with carrying it."
2,I kept on thinking I should have brought another book,"The print was so small that we needed a magnefying glass and the description of several of the sites, restaurants and accomodations in Portugal were a little off. All the information they wrote about was available for free at any tourist information desk. The maps were illegible. All the time I was in Portugal using this book, I kept on thinking I should have gotten another book. I brought this book because I saw the Lonely Planet show on the Travel Channel on Portugal. I though it was great, unfortunately the book wasn't as great. I'll never buy a Lonely Planet travel guide again."
3,Not the greatest but still a good help.,Egypt and Portugal are the only two countries besides America I will ever want to travel in. While not the best guide I have ever read this one is still quite useful. If you ever go there see the Palacio Nacional da Pena in Sintra and the Palaco do Visconde de Estoi near Faro
5,The best,"An excellent, full color and clearly laid out guide to nearly every drug on the market today, illegal, recreational, and medicinal. Lots of photographs, quotes from people who have used the drugs, side effects, addiction and safety information, charts and graphs. This book was a help to me both for researching a book I was writing and for looking up the drugs my 89-year-old grandmother is taking for her pain.I highly recommend this book."
5,Uppers Downers and all arounders,"It was farily fast (faster than some I paid to have rushed). As advertised it was still brand new.Thanks,"
5,"Uppers, Downers, All Arounders",I have been around Drugs of all types for a long time and this book is EXCELLENT! It is a wealth of knowledge.
5,Everything Jude,"So far since I was 16 I have loved all of Jude deveraux's books I am patiently awaiting her new ones to come! This Book was great, but then again I think they all are."
2,What happened to the ending?,"I enjoyed this book up to the last section. The sudden resolution left me very disappointed, it was not even remotely believable. The ending was such a disappointed that I would advise others wait for the paperback - or even wait until your library has it, but don't pay for the hardback."
4,VERY ENJOYABLE READ!,"I laughed outloud so many times during this audio. I believe the narrator is Exquisite! She does the scottish accents so well that you really believe in each character. I believe she may be a co-author as well, but I'm not sure. This was a cute corky romance that I enjoyed very much. I believe the only thing I didn't particularly like was the time the two main characters spent apart towards the end. But over all I would definitely recommend this, at least in audio format."
2,I couldn't remember,"I was trolling Amazon for all the Jude books I'm missing, trying to fill in the blanks. I've read them all, top to bottom, front to back and she's my favorite author. However... When I came across Temptation I couldn't remember which story it was. I knew I'd read it, I recognized the book cover, I just couldn't figure it out. I went to my book box to find my copy. I had to read the WHOLE blurb on the back just to remember who the characters were (I think I may have to read it again 'cause I'm still not too sure). I don't think there's ever been another Jude book I absolutely couldn't remember and I hope there aren't any more."
4,Well I liked it!,I agree that there could have been more romance and character development. But I still thought it was a good book. I have not read too many of this author's books but I am not in the group that thinks she is great. I admit that I did NOT like Knight in Shining Armor. I liked The Velvet Promise but did not like Velvet Song. Perhaps I enjoyed it because my expectations were not as high as other readers.
1,WASTE OF TIME,"This book is a mixed up bunch of trash. Very poor character development, trite situations (uh oh, she fainted, must be pregnant) and worst of all riddled with mistakes. Maybe I am a nit picker but if someone DROWNS they do not have a DEATHBED. DUH. I also have serious doubts about being able to travel from NY to England by ship in 1909 in only 4 days. Does the word EDITOR mean anything to the publisher? I kept wondering if, accidentally, a VERY rough draft had been published. I abhorr books that WASTE MY TIME and I shall not read another by Ms. Deveraux. I will also think twice about purchasing from this publisher again."
3,"Almost, but not quite.....","Jude Deveraux has always been one of my favorite authors. I was slightly dissapointed in her most recent works but with this she has made great strides back to her former greatness. Almost, but not quite.....in my opinion she does her best work with historical romances and perhaps she should stick with what she does best. Although this story was of greater interest than her most recent works, I have to say that I found the ending lacking a great deal. I was happy to see Temperance and James reunite and work out their differences however a longer, more involved ending would have done their story better justice."
2,Great beginning - but then spirals downward,"As I started out reading this book, I liked it a lot, and the chemistry and humor between Temperance and James was great. But as the story goes on, it drags and the ending was really haphazard and without emotion. Plus, there is only one love scene in the entire novel, and even that ends on a sour note. I normally love Deveraux's books, but this was a major disappointment, except for the great first 1/2."
3,Better than some,"I got hooked on Deveraux books when I was in college. I read all her early books and loved them all. Then she started writing books where the main characters play silly little games to get their man. That bored and annoyed me. So, I quit reading her books for awhile. Since I liked her books so much in the beginning, I decided to give her another chance. Temptation was well written with a strong main character. It was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it to any romance reader."
4,A beautifully written story..,I have read all of Jude Deveraux's books and I am happy to see that she has done it again! Another beautiful story by her... I have enjoyed her other novels..each one of them brough tears to my eyes or made me laugh... you really can feel the characters emotions...My cousin introduced me into Ms. Deveraux..and I am glad she did... =) what a wonderful & talented romance author she is!! =0) If you have not read any books by Ms. Deveraux... I suggest you start with Remembrance or A Knight in shining armor.. :) Enjoy!
2,Sad Decline of Jude Devereux,"What happened to her writing? I still remember the first time I read A Knight in Shining Armor. Well, Temptation is nothing like it. The plot construction and style of the novel are choppy, which progressively got worse the deeper I got into the book. I liked both of the main characters just fine (especially the heroine), but together, they just don't have chemistry. This book just didn't do it for me and was a very sorry disappointment."
3,Where is the Romance?,"If you are looking for a good romance book with lots of interaction between the hero and heroine, don't buy this book. I have no idea why Temperance even liked James. They are hardley even together in the book, and when they are they just don't seem like they should go together. If you are looking for a fun book about a woman discovering who she really is and changing herself for the better, then this book is for you. If you want real romance read ""A Knight In Shining Armor."" That is the sweeting romance I have ever read!!!"
3,Disappointing - Not up to par,"I have read, and loved, Jude's books for years but found this one to be a bit of a disappointment. The concept started out ok but I didn't find the usual warmth and depth of characters that I've come to expect from Jude Devereaux. This was a cute, somewhat entertaining story but not what I anticipated."
3,It was okay,"It was interesting enough to keep me interested, I finished it in two days.. But I have read better ..."
1,Bad editing,"I loved the book, however the editing of this audio was awful. this seems to be a common occurance with this author's books."
2,So Dissapointed!,"I have and always will be a HUGE JD fan but this is one book that I am sorry to say left me a bit upset.... Although I liked the plot, I kept reading til the end WAITING for the smile to come to my face in the end.... but it never came, I was upset with the the lack of chemisrty from the the hero and heroine, although I felt her drive and got to know her, I was very dissapointed when I felt truly nothing for the hero which is a FIRST ever as I usually fall in love with the hero's in JD's books. I felt this this was all centered on Temperance and really no depth was given to him at all. I absolutley HATED the ending which I will not go into for those who have not read this book, but hated is truly an understatement on this one. I was generous giving this 2 stars due to the fact that I did make it to the end of the book, so again the story was ok but the end result never came together as it should have."
4,"Surpising, not your classic ending!!","This is the first Jude Deveraux novel I have read and I must say I loved every bit of it. Many parts will put a smile on your face and some parts may even cause you to let out a giggle. What suprised me the most is that this book does not have a classic ending, which I really enjoyed. The ending has a unique twist to it but still brings adequate closure to the story of Temperance and the McCairn."
1,Cartridge leaked toner,"Purchased this item in March, 2010. Although we did not open package until January, 2011, toner had leaked out all over and was unusable. Since the 30-day refund period had expired, we basically threw away $177."
4,A Blazing Trail of Truth!,"Trailblazing has been one of the first nonfiction titles I have ever read from Alyson Publications, a favorite publisher of mine. It is also a perfect example that true life is better than fiction. Although I am far from being athletic (I was a band nerd in high school), Eric's story is one that I would highly suggest to all ""team players."" A story of acceptance, it is much like any other high schooler's battle to fit in, yet this time it is the teacher trying to win that battle instead. The support he received from his students is truly touching, as they stood by his side to meet their goals as a team, ignoring the hate and harassment. If you read The Front Runner by Patricia Nell Warren, then don't miss out on Eric Anderson's Trailblazing, the new leader of the race. Pardon the pun, but he is definitely on the right track!!"
3,Comprehensive but mediocre,"The range of recipes is highly commendable; one can find a recipe for chili con carne to african chicken and everything in between.However, the recipes don't seem to have been properly tested. The blue plate chili for instance is 2 cans of tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons of masa harina, and a tablespoon of sugar short of being a chili. The asian short ribs omits the all important corn starch coating. Perhaps the most important mistake as others have noted is that the amount of liquid doesn't seem properly calibrated.In today's age of the Internet, perhaps these recipes are meant to be used a starting point only. The timings do seem accurate so use them as a reference. But if the blue plate special recipe is available on the internet, why the need for an inaccurate cookbook in the first place?"
1,don't buy!,"This book was a big disappointment. I've tried two recipes, each with terrible results and cannot recommend the book. Rice Pudding with Cherries and Almonds turned into a curdled, browned mess. Grits `n' Cheddar Cheese were not much better, encrusting the crock in a thick, layer of burned grits. Each recipe recommended cooking on high for 4 hours but was overdone in under 3. Both recipes called for eggs, which, after mixed, rose to the top and cooked separately from the rest of the dish. I honestly think these recipes were not tested by their author. Buyer beware!"
1,A Big Mess,"Although Finlayson's book is well-laid out and beautiful to look at it, it has major problems. She seems to have overlooked the need for liquid in many of her recipes. The split pea soup has NO liquid listed, leaving me to guess at the amount. The recipe for short ribs in black bean sauce ended up a burned disaster. I will not use this book again."
2,Very lacking,"To make a long story short, do not get this book unless you already understand OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP. I work w/ EIGRP and OSPF so the chapters on those were decent (b/c I already know them). But the chapters on BGP were awful. I read them twice and still didn't understand what it was saying. At this point I went to the Cisco web site and printed out the white paper on BGP and read it. That made sense. Buy the book for brief overviews on the topics, but nothing more."
2,Routing Study Guide review,"This is the third book I have purchase authored by Tod Lammle. The first was his CCNA which was very good, the 2nd was his Switching book which was okay but there were several topics not covered that were on the test. I expected the routing book to be as good as the CCNA, but it fell very short of that expectation. There was a lot of granular information in the book that is good to use when researching a problem but was not touched upon in the test. I had a decent understanding of BGP before reading this book and thought the BGP sections were hard to understand and in some cases the information was just wrong. There should have been a better review of this book before publication for technical accuracey."
2,CCNP routing study guide,"I used Todd Lammle's CCNA study guide with a good result. And as result I purchased this book without thinking about it. It was a bad decision. This book had lots of spelling errors and worst, incorrect material - which is really bad, I coudn't trust the material. Even though I did read the whole book, I ended up relying on another study quide (actually testing software) which explained things at a more detailed level. Simply, this book will not prepare you for the test, it's too simple and haphazard."
2,Way too many errors,"I have passed my CCNA, CCNP switching and Support exams and I have used the SYBEX range of books for all of them, I found those books to be good and informative with no spelling errors, command line errors and information in the wrong places. This book is full of mistakes, the information within this book is very informative but also very frustrating when you spot all these obvious mistakes, this book was rushed to be put on the shelves that is for sure, it can't of been proof read because if it had there would be no where near as many mistakes as this. Yes this book i'm sure can help get your CCNP:Routing exam out of the way, but I really don't believe people should waste their money on something that clearly has not been throughly proof read. I now have questions on using the Sybex CCNP:remote access study guide."
1,What??,"This booklet was missing most of the middle pages. Wired, organic and hard to find drugs (Do It Niw Foundation publication ; DIN 213)"
2,Unsatisfying flavor --- and too much work,"I've tried several of these Annie Chun noodle dishes and soups with noodles. I don't find any of them very good as compared with 'real' Asian food. Some aren't too bad when doctored with some soy sauce, hot sauce, or other sauce. And some aren't too bad for ease of preparation.This one isn't easily doctored, nor is it that fast/simple to make. Therefore I don't see any reason to keep in the pantry. If I don't feel like spending 20-30 minutes to make my own Asian food from scratch, I'll stick with better/easier ready-made products to keep on hand."
4,Great Collection,"Steve Camp was a popular Christian artist during the 80's and 90's. This is a great collection of his songs. What is great about Steve Camp is his Biblically sound lyrics. Although I did not enjoy every song on the collection (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), it is a great introduction to this fine artist."
1,Be Careful!! Made in China,My bull terrier loved this toy. It's long lasting and the only toy that my dog didn't destroy in 10 minutes. I thought it was great until he came down with a fever and intense diarrhea and a low grade fever after getting a piece of it out of the toy. The vet said that it was recalled a few years back but couldn't find out why. She said to stay away from any pet things made in China as there are no regulations on the making of them. I won't be giving them to my dog - please be warned and make an informed decision before buying it.
3,Great idea but overpriced,"The Everlasting Treats are best combined with the Everlasting Treat Ball. This is a great concept to keep dogs occupied, give them something to chew on,etc. but the Triple Crown products are overpriced."
3,My dog loved these but they are far from everlasting.,"I have a 1 year old lab/australian shepard mix, 65 pounds, and she tore through the Everlasting treat in 5 minutes. She liked both the beef and the liver flavors, but I was expecting more from this treat. I figured the treat would at least last an hour. I still like to give this treat to my dog because it breaks into small pieces versus a rawhide bone that can tear into large pieces and cause choking or digestion problems. Ordering the treats save about 40% of the price I pay at my local pet store."
3,"Worst Smelling of the Lot, but the Dog Loves Them","First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really ""everlasting"" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in theStarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large.Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.Third: The liver discs SMELL. Well, they ALL smell, but these are pretty pungent. I try to make the dog play with it across the room, whereas the other flavors aren't nearly as off-putting."
4,dog loved these,My pitbull would go crazy for these. they even lasted a few days with relentless chewing. Due to the price though they were only ever a rare treat for my dog.
3,Doesn't last long,"My minuture schnauzer likes these in the ball....he can eat one in less than an hour, so this wasn't what I thought it would be."
4,Not Everlasting but great,Not Quite Everlasting but my Bluetick Coonhound and Majestic Tree hound loved them. The treats did last a couple of days which is far longer than most treats in my house with 2 hounds over 100 pounds each. I will be buying more.
3,Misleading dimensions.,It may just be a mistake in my part but.. under the product description it says the product dimensions are 6x2x9 inches.. this is the packaging not the treat itself... if I would have known how small the actual treats are they would not... and are not...worth the cost... Don't waste your money.
5,Great treat for a great toy !,"My dog LOVES this flavor, though he also loves the other flavors as well! I swear by these treats and the Everlasting Treat Ball which these cookie treats fit in. I have to keep a constant supply of these cookie inserts on hand just to insure that I don't run out. It takes my dog about a week just to get through one of these cookies because the dog's can only scrape off small amounts of it at a time rather than gulping down big bites quickly. If it weren't for these cookie inserts and the Everlasting Treat Ball, my puppy would have chewed through all of my furniture, so I can not say enough good things about them. I will not be without them and have recommended them to my friends, whose dogs love them too."
4,"Good, but not everlasting","My 9 year-old pom, with his little doggie teeth, ate 3 of these in the span of 3 days. He did not have the holder, and I think that helped him. He doesn't eat anything but beef treats, but he liked the liver. He also prefers softer treats, but he liked these. I will buy them again."
4,"Good treat, but only safe with ball","This is a good product to use in combination with the treat ball. My Cocker Spaniel uses a medium size. Probably wouldn't be good for a large dog, with a stronger jaw. The ball itself is made of a sturdy rubber/plastic that is flexible but enduring. My dog's a chewer, and she hasn't destroyed it yet. The Everlasting Treat disks used in combo with the ball seem safe. I wouldn't give the dog the treat on its own, because of the choking hazard. But when in the ball, my dog can only lick and get small bits of treat at a time. It's a good toy and treat to keep a dog occupied. As for the price - I can get a 2 pack of these treats for $7 in a pet store."
3,11lb dogs: Ball + 2 treats (1 on each side) good for 2/11hr spans of time,"My dogs are obsessed with these. First I bought the wrong ball - don't be confused with the treat ball where you put small treats inside. I nearly died when I realized that i needed to buy TWO balls that were more than TWENTY DOLLARS EACH!! (thinking: ""these had BETTER be good"")My dogs are 11 lbs each and I got the medium ball. I think that's the right size. I gave them each a ball with a treat in both sides. After two days gone to work (22hrs in total) they've eaten the treats. So I have to spend at LEAST $7 per dog to utilize these balls for 2 days out of the week.Hmmm...this is like a smoking addiction or something.If you need for shorter periods of time; i.e. while you watch a movie, dinner, gone for coupla hours, GREAT toy. I do have to be careful because my two dogs will fight over one ball when another is sitting a few feet away. I guess they REALLY like them.Good luck."
4,Dog loves them.,"These are great and my dog loves them, but if you put them in normally (rounded side outwards), my dog can east more of it in a day leaving jsut a ring that she can't get out of the ball, and then grows bored of. Putting them in the other way makes them last as long, but doesn't keep the dog as active with the toy either. Still a great product"
1,What is the point?,This scale only will weigh about two pounds. It is of no use as a kitchen scale and is very expensive.
1,Broke immediately.,"My 2 year old loves this drum, but the top of the drum ripped within a week. It is made out of something like a heavy paper. A toy car fell onto the drum. While the drum clearly isn't made for that, it was not a heavy toy or a long drop. It was one of those things that happen often in a house with a child. I would purchase a drum with a different kind of material on the playing surface next time. Something a bit more sturdy."
2,Cannot cope with a 3 year old,"A really nice drum. It sounds loud and kids love it. Unfortunately, the drum skin didn't last long and was destroyed by a three year old within days. Not sure what the cover was made out of, only a sort of paper. It was really was weak. Luckily there are two sides that are playable on this drum and the second side is hanging in there under adult supervision (but kids naturally want to whack this thing of course). If the makers provided extra and better quality drum ""skin"", then this drum should last a while and be a 5 star product (that can't cost them much). It is relatively easy to take apart and reassemble, but parents of toddlers don't want to spend those rare moments of time they have to themselves to locate, buy and reassemble parts to newly purchased toys."
5,Toy Drum Review,"I bought this as a gift for my 3 year old daughter. She has a fascination with the Drummer Boy (from the Christmas song), so we bought her this. She seems to really like it. It is very well made."
3,Fair drum,"The drum is lined with a thin paper so it is very easy to tear just by beating it with the drumsticks, but it is a very affordable drum so I really didn't expect much. Even after a tear, you can place tape over it and it sounds as good as new. You basically get what you pay for with this item."
5,This is the best cd of Aziza,When you will listen yandi ganim daha you will understand how is great this artist.
1,Still haven't gotten it,So it's been more than a month and I haven't gotten it. Lost in the mail? Never sent? I don't know.
5,Just What I Wanted,A high quality paperback that shipped exactly as promised. The book of course is fantastic. Very pleased with this purchase
3,El Coronel No Tiene Quien Le Escriba,"I guess it's an ok book, but once you read it, you realize that it doesn't really have an ending. You never really find out what happens to the rooster, or if the Colonel ever really did receive the letter."
5,"""a wealth of practical information""","Cassidy and Allanson have assembled a talented group of authors to address the more common genetic disorders. The chapters are extremely well organized and each emphasizes not only diagnostic techniques and differential diagnosis, but also patient management. The generalist will find a wealth of practical information readily available and accessible. The clinical geneticist will discover and rediscover valuable ""pearls"" within this text. --Edward R.B. McCabe, Department of Pediatrics, Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA"
5,Thank you,This product was just as described. I have not listened to this yet though. There are no scratches on the back of the Cd. I was happy with the speed of delivery.
2,Could this be the inspiration for Li'l Kim and Foxy Brown?,"Before Li'l Kim and Foxy brown burst onto the rap scene with their sexually explicit raps there was HWA (Ho's With an Attitude). On this, their smutty debut release they hold nothing back with rhymes about such topics as cunnilingus ""Eat This,"" and Phone sex ""1-900-B-I-T-C-H-E-S. The girls can rap and some of the songs are quite clever. Perhaps with some more top knotch producers the group could have had a brighter future. But as it is, this album only succeeds as a humorous novelty. An album that is initially enjoyable for it's unabashed raunchiness, but ultimately becomes quite boring after repeat listening."
1,Overmixed Garbage,"These CD's had the potential to be a good buy, with several great songs and artists. The overmixing, however, completely ruins even the best tracks. Songs stop in the middle for no apparent reason, or are overwhelmed with an added generic techno beat which completely obscures the original. Fortunately the middle portion of each song is generally untouched, so you can at least use these CDs to get an idea of what songs/artists you want to buy from other producers."
4,Excellent dance mixes. Well done.,"This one reminds me of the best of my dancing days! Very well mixed, upbeat, fast. Worth the money. You could play it at a club and it would be a hit!"
5,Best book ever!,One of the most interesting books I've ever read about WWII. I liked the fascinating pictures depicting the war. The book was easy to read and I was able to read it quickly. It is a simple book about the Battle of the Bulge and easy for kids to understand.
2,flimsy,"Although I liked the size of these earrings, they were very thin and the closure was not secure. With my long hair, it wouldn't have taken much to have lost one or both and not known it. Certainly not worth the money."
5,Wonderful Poetry Book,"I was introduced to Justin Chin's work through an Asian American literature course in college. A year later I found myself still thinking about his shocking poems because in class we had only read ""Lick My Butt"". I wanted to know more so I bought this book. What I found is a collection of beautiful poetry.Some poems are hilarious and in your face and some are really lovely to read. I went ahead and bought some more of his poetry books. I'd suggest this for anyone with an open mind. I think anyone under that condition could appreciate his work."
5,An innovative guide to producing fabric bowls,"Linda Johansen's Fast Fun & Easy Fabric Bowls is an innovative guide to producing fabric bowls provides five bowl designs to create in the fabric and colors you choose. Tips included for creating flexible forms, interfacing materials, and special effects provide some intriguing insights into producing impressive fabric bowls which are both reversible and washable."
3,Not fun,This is not a fun project & when you finish you wonder now what do I do with it & not cheap to make either.
1,Book Description Missing Important Information,"Before I bought this book, I did not realize that (a) you must know how to sew and (b) you must own a sewing machine before you can make a fabric bowl. I was extremely disappointed when I eagerly opened the book to find that sewing skills and a sewing machine are absolutely required - you cannot make a bowl without having both. I would never have purchased this book if the description had made it clear that sewing skills and a sewing machine are required. I did return this book."
5,A Must-Have for the Serious Canaler,"Kate Mulligan's new book is a must for the glove compartment of all serious canal fans! She gives detailed descriptions of canal sites in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland, focusing not only on the places, but on the people, ""the characters,"" who worked to make their parks a reality. Kate highlights sites along most of the 19th century canals in the three Mid-Atlantic states, describing their history and current events sponsored by each of the canal parks. The book includes related, noncanal places of interest, such as the Brunswick Railroad Museum, the Johnstown Flood Museum and the Eckley Miners' Village. A great gift for anyone who loves travel and the transportation history of the Mid-Atlantic."
3,Music CD,I was a bit disappointed as I thought it would be more digitally mastered.Still overall good CD for old smoky blues.
5,A in Torts,"This book is sufficient for Torts. If your Professor uses this book consider yourself lucky because it's quite small compared to other casebooks. Every sentence is of the book is useful and you won't waste your time reading nonsense. My particular Professor only taught what was in this book so other supplements (E&E's, Crunchtime...) was not necessary. Read the notes after the cases and you'll understand the core concepts!"
1,Palm Pilot Cover,"I was very disappointed with this cover, as it split right at the hinge within a few days after purchase."
4,Just like the OEM part and cheaper...,This part looks just like the OEM part I removed and seems to work just as well (and is much cheaper than the Ford OEM part). The repair takes about an hour and you don't need to a mechanic to do it. Found some good repair instructions and pictures at Autoclinix.com
3,It works. Just not super well. But it works.,"I bought this to replace the Door Actuator in my 2002 Ford Explorer 4x4. Is is exactly the same as the unit I took out, minus color and guts I imagine. I didn't even have to take apart my dash to get at it. I only took off the small part of the dash under the steering wheel and then the metal brace and cut some plastic away and got right at it. It works, but slowly. I imagine the original part was faster. Also, have to put the blower on high to get it to flip the heater door. You can hear an audible clunk when the heater door flips over. I fear that without turning the fan on High when turning to heat, the gears inside the actuator will get stripped just like the original did. Perhaps a factory part would work better, but this will do for now and took me about 40 min to install."
5,Perfect fit,"Fit perfectly and has operated reliably all summer. The working space is tight, but manageable with a low profile ratchet."
4,Works good,It was not made like the old one but it fit and opens the door now. Now I have A/C again for less than $40.00 good enough for me. Who cares what it looks like the old one or if it fits the same as long as it works. My local parts store wanted over $60.00. Thanks
1,"Leak, leak, gushing river","Does anyone make a product that will last?! I've had this iron for a few years and have put up with leaks until the reservoir finally leaking out around the electric cord! If you have this model, throw it away before you shock yourself or burn your house down. You do not get what you pay for with this iron."
1,"Drip, leak, drip!","I really think people should wait a while before they write a review on a product or appliance. I loved this iron at first, but after about a year, it started leaking. Not just a little...a lot! Now I feel I spent all that extra money for nothing. Even when it sits for a little while with water in it, it leaks all over my counter and onto the floor. Also, the burst of steam doesn't work--it only worked for a little while. All directions were followed. I am very unhappy with this iron."
1,# Leaks Heavily From the Bottom! #,"I've had this iron for maybe two years and purchased at Target. Thought the ""German"" made and name were known with good quality, but I was proved wrong. I have put up with leaks around the reservoir and electric cord area when upright and horizontal! If you have any Rowenta model, throw it away before you shock yourself or burn your house down. You do not get what you pay for with this iron."
4,no vertical steam,I purchased this iron at Target a month ago. When I first used it the steam button didn't give a burst of steam. I exchanged it for another one thinking the first one was defective. I am still having a steam problem. When I push the steam button nothing happens. Other wise the iron is great. I am dissapointed I don't have vertical steam and am considering returning it for a different type of iron.
4,That's right...,"This record has a message, and that message is 'ladies, take off your clothes.' I put this whole style of music in a catagory I call 'Bitchin' Metal. Now where is my hairspray, fringe pants and cowboy boots."
1,Not worth the time to read this...,"Oh my...these little boys don't even have a CLUE what rock is all about. Poison lives up to their name on this absolutely horrid drivel masquerading as ""Metal"". If you want TRUE rock and roll, please visit the Jimi Hendrix ""Are You Experienced"" page and you'll be on your way to truly realizing what artistic creation is all about. This is merely loud noise to make money and score chicks."
4,In good Condition,Though new the sleeve was slightly damaged. I didn't read anywhere that there was damage but that may have been my fault for not looking closely enough. The actual record itself was in fine condition with no scratches. New was a true statement as it was still in it's original plastic sheeting. Overall a great buy.
3,Simple?,"Yes. Poison is simple, and cheesy, and silly and shallow, and all of it.They are also fun. They're a good party band, and this is a good party disc. Don't expect Queensryche or Iron Maiden or Motorhead. Expect an 80s party, and you'll be happy."
1,hair metal sucks,"I have no problem with a band that dresses up a bit as long as they have talent. Poison is not one of those bands. They have the mentality of adolescent junior high-school horn dogs. If you want to hear a good eighties band, listen to the Police or U2."
4,"Good CD, Even for Hair Metal","This disc is alot better than ""Cat Dragged In"" probably because Poison had matured a little bit and wiped off some of the makeup (not all of it). ""Nothin' But a Good Time"" was catchy and popular and you can't deny that. ""Fallen Angel"" is also a well written track. ""Every Rose"", of course, needs no description being one of the most popular ballads of the 20th century. Just don't take Poison too seriously and you won't be disappointed."
4,"Great sound, mediocre bonus material","As others have noted, the remastered sound is really good, and makes the purchase worth it. The bonus song is fine, but not more. The ""world premiere interview"" is really lame though. There's nothing ""premiere"" about it -- it's just some replay of an interview from the time of the album's release with *a lot* of the album music included under the voices. I didn't hear anything that wasn't just the usual rock star marketing b.s. I would have preferred an actual premiere interview, maybe some new commentary from the band or something. Also, who releases a big remaster without liner notes or recollections or interesting anecdotes? Poison, apparently. As I said, if you're a Poison fan, buy this for the sound of the remastered tracks."
3,Open Up and Say ... AHH Not Bad!,"Up there with Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and other bands of the era, Poison helped create the greatest decade of rock music ever made. Although not the best Poison album Open Up and Say ...AHH! is still a worthwhile purchase. Their most covered song by pub bands Every Rose Has It's Thorn, a slow love ballad is on this album which most people either love or hate. The other huge hit Nothin' But A Good Time, on this album is a sensational rock song. Most of the other songs on here are pretty good too. I would also recommend buying their album Flesh & Blood as well for sensational songs like Unskinny Bop.If you like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, AC/DC and similar bands then you have to listen to Poison as well. The cover booklet also contains lyrics and photographs of the band."
4,Catchiest song on today,its a good song that you will be singing all day and still not get sick off...its contagious and has a real beat to it
2,not porn,"my boyfriend flipped through it,an said there is no nudity on this dvd,or even close,just a bunch of girls touching themselves"
2,"Two good CD's, but not as good as just one of his recent CDs","Unfortunately I disagree with the other reviewers. I found this compilation album to be a reasonably good introduction to the music of John Michael Talbot, but by taking snapshots from his long career and large repertoire it does not adequately represented his best music. Talbot himself says that his mid 80's album ""Heart of the Shepherd"" represents the beginning of his mature music, and that and his later music is what I prefer. I own that album and also ""The Hiding Place"", and ""Meditations in the Spirit"". Each of these albums presents a consistent spiritual message and I find that any one of them has more good music, and consistency, than this double CD which is weighted towards his earlier, maturing work. But it is John Michael Talbot, and does have much wonderful music. Three (or maybe four) stars for the music, but I only give it two in the end by comparison with his best work."
5,So very peaceful,"I actually bought this cd by chance. I was surfing on Amazon when I accidentally clicked on this album. I decided to listen to a few of the clips and immediately I knew I had to pick up this gem. Praise the Lord for music like this! In these times of cheesy commercialized songs, Talbot's music stands out with strong Biblical lyrics and haunting peaceful melodys. I just recently had surgery and during my recovery this album has brought me much comfort. I definitely recommend these 35 songs for your collection. Thank you."
5,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"If you want music that will take you into the Throne Room of theLiving God, this is the CD for you!Fill your heart, your spirit with His love. This music willhelp you to adore Him, worship Him, love Him.Highly Recommended! Outstanding!"
4,Uncompromising music from a gifted franciscan monk,"JMT continues to provide music to an every growing audience. this CD is a wonderful ""taste"" of the music by a performer who is centered on music to lift the soul. I continue to be amazed at the ability of JMT to bring such richness from such simple music."
3,Too much Hollywood music a la Ben-Hur,"The point is not whether Michael Talbot is a talented singer and devoted Christian. He is certainly both. The point is: is this particular cd good or not? From my point of view it is a rather mediocre album. I feel that Michael Talbot is at his best when playing the guitar with minimal orchestral accompaniment like in his acclaimed ""Come to the Quiet"". Unfortunately, what you will find on this cd is a medley of such delightful songs with more ambitious orchestral compositions which are simply terrible and smack of Hollywoodian film music a la Ben-Hur or The Ten Commandments."
4,Kids learn math in a magical land.,"Alice in Numberland is a painless way to get your kids learning math. If they know Alice from her other books, they'll especially like it. Generally, Alice here is concerned more with logic than mathematics per se, which makes this book a good introduction to the field, by teaching logical thinking. The riddles seem to be at a good level for kids, not too difficult, but challenging. I'm not sure I like the illustrations or the writing very much, but overall it's not bad, and a nice effort. If you're looking for a good book of riddles, to keep your kids busy on those long car rides, this might be the one."
5,great for yoga enthusiates,THe best yoga book written. Goswami Kriyananda shows you the way to sequence your yoga to open the chakras for the best health. Great pictures of the poses and why each works for you. You need to do yoga in the right sequence and this book is the one to lead you. This book will lead you to a happy and productive life. Namaste.
3,Some interesting Ideas.,"The author has presented some interesting food for thought about yoga and spirirutal living.If this subject is your interest, I would also strongly recommend reading ""Autobiography of a Yogi"" by Parmahansa Yogananda, which gives one a greater overview on how Kriya yoga came to the west and what Babaji's great plan is for humanity."
1,I don't think this is a beautiful book,"This book is from a person who claims to be a disciple of a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda ( and surely it is true... ). As the teachings given (in my opinion) seem to be 2nd hand ones; the worst thing of this book is that it contains a strange (and apparently wrong) form of kriya yoga which, I think, it may be either delusive (if it is a fake) or dangerous (if for some reason it really works). I think that kriya yoga is a holy science and maybe it should not be taught this way. Furthermore other techniques, mudras and so on are described, but as far as I know all these things do not belong to the kriya yoga tradition of Paramamhansa Yogananda.I suggest you should read some book of Paramahansa Yogananda, Roy Eugene Davis or Swami Kriyananda instead of this one."
4,Interesting Ideas,"the author has presented some very interesting data on Kriya yoga.Also Recommended: AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI by Paramahansa Yogananda.............and God Talks With Arjuna (BHAGAVAD GITA) ,these books will give more details about the history and spiritual meanings of kiya yoga."
4,Good Quality,"High quality whey protein. No artificial anything. Smells a little funny at first, but makes a nice addition to Shakeology."
3,New whey drinker,"About a week ago I added whey to my diet, to get more protein. I really hope it's good for me, 'cause it tastes like liquefied board chalk. I have tried it with pretty much everything I have in my refrigerator: 1% milk, whole milk, diluted milk, soy milk, almond milk, plain water, and with coffee. The end result is the same: chalk. I don't want to add sugar or any other sweetener. Guess I'm just going to have to tough it out."
3,Tastes like nothing,"I have tried many ON products in the past. This is my first ""natural"" ON product. This is advertized as not containing any artificial sweetener and for the same reason it doesnt taste good. I will be using this to make smoothies only. When I am just drinking with water, I will prefer the non-natural product"
4,No sugar so not as sweet,I like this whey protein. It mixes very well with both soy milk and water. The taste is just ok because there is no sugar added so the mix is not as sweet as the ON Double Rich Chocolate. It is a nice change to switch on and off between the two so you don't get board with the taste. Great prices from Amazon but it does fluctuate alot.
5,The best for the money,"The gold standard whey protein from Optimum Nutrition is the best protein you can buy for the money. I have used it for my post workout protein shake and I have noticed increased recovery, strength and energy. It mixes VERY well with just a spoon and the Natural Chocolate flavor is not sweet like the others - just perfect. I cut it with 1/2 2% milk and water and it tastes great! Best thing, it doesn't upset your stomach like most heavy proteins."
3,Too sweet,"I have loved the flavor of regular Gold Standard Double Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream, but I just received this natural version and find it almost undrinkable because it has such an extreme artificial sweetener taste. I don't have the ingredient list with me at the moment, so I can't see the sweetener that is used--I guess it has to be something natural, maybe stevia?--but whatever it is, there is too much of it. With the other powders I would mix with milk, but this one was so strong that I have to mix with water and use only 3/4 of a scoop instead of a whole scoop just to be able to drink it (and that is not even enjoyable)."
5,Best tasting great natural protein,This is the best tasting natural whey protein I have tried. I usually mix two scoops with water and ice in shaker.
1,whey,"I have ordered whey many times and never had a problem but this last one---- it is horrible tasting, I was very disappointed with this product.optimum Nutrition 100 O/0 whey gold standard natural whey"
1,Did not care for taste and it is sweetened with Steva derivative,"I did not care for the taste, slightly artificial and bitter which I think is due to the fact that it is sweetened in part with a Steva derivative. I will not order again."
1,Beware of sromach upsets.,"I was suggested by somebody to try this. I tried chocolate variety.Following are my findings after using this product for a while:1. I never felt it is working.2. I have had some stomach upsets after using this. In the beginning, I did not understand why I am getting frequent stomach upsets. I did some research on internet and came to know that many other people have experienced similar problems with protein powders. After discontinuing this product, my stomach upsets stopped. So I am convinced that this product is not for me.I am not saying that these products don't work as many people claim that they work.But, for me, natural sources of protein like eggs, yogurt, milk are more effective than all these company made products. Now I lost confidence not just on this brand, but on all brands of protein powders."
5,Perfect,"Ok, so usually I'd expect protein supplements to be a chore. Hell, my friend drinks some canned protein mess that makes him gag as he's struggling to chug it down. But this vanilla whey... wonderful! Blend it in a glass of slim milk and some strawberries and I have a 35+g protein shake in the morning. I can add it to plain water to have some good vanilla flavoring while boosting protein intake at the same time. I haven't tried the chocolate flavor but since there is no added sweetener, I don't know how it would taste. Thus I went vanilla and have never looked back."
4,does not taste good,it doesn't have any flavor. it's drinkable. definitely worth it if you don't want artificial sweeteners.
3,Contains MSG,"I got this based on the claim that it was all natural. It is, kinda, about as natural as hydrolysis anyway. The ""whey peptides"" are hydrolyzed protein. When you hydrolyze protein containing glutamine you get MSG. No thanks. The online information may not mention that the protein is hydrolyzed but the product label does.EDIT: Changed to 3 stars because the whey peptides are the 3rd ingredient and this product only contains 4 grams of glutamine per serving, only some of which would be from the whey peptides. MSG is a natural & necessary neurotransmitter which only fries brain cells in excessive amounts. Still I think I'll be mixing this powder with another to limit my exposure. People with MSG intolerance need 3 grams or more to notice it and AFAIK they're a good gauge of which restaurants to avoid."
5,Love It!! Taste Great,I bought this Protein a little nervous because I am used to drinking the Gold Standard Reg. Vanilla Ice Cream so I wasn't too sure on this one. But being cheaper I Decided to give it a shot and I am Glad I Did.it Taste Great! I really Like.Hides Really Well and its Natural.I make my Power SmoothieContains:1 cup of Soy Milk ( Costco Kirkland Brand Vanilla Flavor)1 Cup of Blue Berriesand one Scoop of This 100% Whey Vanilla Natural)Works Great for me I have been feeling Stronger and Lifting Heavier Overall Increased my Performance in my Work out Routine.Price is Great and if you sign up for Subscription you get %15 Percent OFF. Even Better
5,Great product - Good taste choices,"I've been using Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein for several years, and I absolutely love it. I've used it on shakes, oatmeal, puddings, etc - anything that I can add a little extra protein and flavoring to. The good thing is it's low cal, has 1g fat per serving, and very low sugar.The only downside is choosing the ""right"" flavor. I recently bought the regular ""vanilla"" flavor, but it isn't as delicious as the others I've purchased. My favorite flavors so far are Vanilla Ice Cream (!!!!), Banana Cream, and Chocolate Mint. My least favorite - Cookies and Cream. Tastes nothing like it, and it has a strong malt taste (which I don't like). You may want to consider getting small sample pouches at GNC or Vitamin Shoppe so you can determine which taste suits you the most.Highly recommended product."
5,Great Product!,I've used Optimum Nutrition's Whey protein powder for 3 yrs now and love the stuff. I put one scoop into my yogert in the morning and I'm good to go!
5,Great taste (chocolate) - Use as coffee creamer,"I've been using ON 100% Natural Whey for almost a year now, and it's fantastic. Whether used as coffee creamer, mixed in a glass of water, or used in my frozen churner to make ice cream, the chocolate flavor is the best!Don't let the new packaging fool ya, it's the same ON 100% Natural Whey protein."
4,Doesnt Taste as good as Muscle Milk,"I decided to try this out instead of my regular muscle milk because of its high sales rank on Amazon, its pretty much the same thing as muscle milk but you only use up 1 scoop per serving of this vs muscle milks 2 scoops per serving and this is $10 cheaper then Muscle Milk. The taste of this product is not as good as muscle milk however, muscle milk taste smooth, creamy, and like a milk shake with no need to add additional products to add taste to it. This product taste almost like nothing, I purchased the Vanilla flavored tub and didnt taste any vanilla flavor in there, it tasted almost flavorless with soy milk.Pros- Cheaper then Muscle Milk- 100% Natural- Good source of Protein- Will lasts you longer then Muscle Milk since it uses 50% less powder per serving and does the same job.Neutral- FlavorlessCons- Does not taste as good as Muscle Milk- Amazon Subscribe & Save not available for this product- Amazon Prime Shipping not available for this product"
2,vanilla = sickeningly sweet,"With high hopes, I tried the vanilla flavored Natural Whey. Disgusting! WAY too sweet--almost inedible for my tastes. And the vanilla flavoring is too strong as well. What were they thinking?Still searching for a good quality whey protein with nothing artificial AND without added flavoring or sweetener.(Update: I've since discovered Now 100% Pure Whey Protein Isolate (Natural) Unflavored. Excellent!)"
2,Not impressed what so ever,"I absolutely LOVED the original chocolate flavor of the whey protein... so i figured 'Hey why not try out the Natural whey' so i received it in the mail and was super excited to try it out. PFFFF to my dismay it tasted NOTHING like the original. it was chalky like, bitter... blahhh if returning items were easier i would have definitely done that. Looks like im stuck with 2 lbs of bitter/chalky whey for a while.Only reason i put 2 stars is because of the company; i know its giving my body what it needs but...if youre looking for a yumming tasting whey or you think it will taste like the original. im warning you IT TASTES LIKE CRAP"
5,good taste,Its great and i will but it again for my workouts. it is resonable priced and last a long time.
4,"Good, but not great.","I have been using Jay Robb 100%whey which I love, but it is very pricey. I can not use artifical sweeteners due to chemical sensitivity. Aspartame,even in small amounts, effects my cognative skills (I can't even count to ten)and causes SEVERE migraines. Splenda in small amounts is ok, but I would not want to take it daily basis. Stevia is a healthier option, but it does leave a slightly bitter taste in your mouth. This product mixed ok in milk, although it's consistancy is thinner than Jay Robb's. When mixed with 1/2 cup yogurt and 1/2 cup milk, the consistancy was much better. I am giving this four stars because of the price (12oz of Jay Robb is about $24.00). I don't hate the taste-it's just ok. If I wasn't using it every day for breakfast,I would probably opt to buy the Jay Robb."
2,Too Strong,"I'm a fan of the line, I love the chocolate, but this vanilla was too fake tasting and too strong tasting. Vanilla should be subtle, this was more like taking a shot of extract."
2,Yucky taste,"I am sure those who rave about the taste of this protein havent tasted the good tasting but slightly expensive proteins like Allthewhey Isolate(vanilla only), Myofusion, musclemilk, monstermilk etc. This is one of the worst tasting protein drink I ever had. The Stevia taste makes me vomit. So buyers beware and dont fall into the hype. Ideally taste a sample first and then buy if you like it. I wish I had done that."
4,My go-to protein.,"The fructose and lecithin are unfortunate, but less additive than many other whey products have. The protein itself is very high-quality, and is processed at low temperature to avoid denaturing (which has several health benefits beyond just muscle-building)."
5,Protein shake,"Was happy to see it didn't have most of the artificial sweeteners. Instead it has Stevia, which according to books I've read is supposed to be okay to prevent blood sugar roller coaster effects.I mix this with water and add cinnamon, so don't worry about the taste. I drink it for the protein."
4,Solid,"The Whey Protein Powder is all you could ask for, besides the lack of taste, but that's what you're getting when you want 100% Natural flavored. It's cheap, it's helpful, and it does the job. The taste is something you can get used to, especially if you use milk. If you mix it with water....try something else then."
4,Great Product - Okay Taste (Natural Vanilla),"I had previously ordered the ON 100%% Whey Gold Standard 5 lb in 'Vanilla Ice Cream' flavor and loved it. Tasted fantastic (if you're into vanilla like myself.) This time around, that same flavor was not available, so I tried the 'Natural Whey, Vanilla'. It's good and the product is high quality, but it's not as tasty as the other one. If you're looking for a good, high-protein content powder, this is the right thing - just choose your flavor."
3,too pricy; go with ON whey gold,"Way 2 expensive at $66. Optimum has good protein, I myself have (my 4th 5lb purchase) Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound and it's $45. The ""natural"" label isn't worth it."
4,Top of the line,"Gold Standard has the best protein shakes hands down. It also tastes decent (none of them taste good, stop lying). The only drawback is because it has such a distinct flavor, you get tired of it quickly- especially if you're drinking it a couple times a day. However, their formula is top-notch and I would recommend this shake"
4,almost perfect..,"This protein is great and has the least amount of filler and garbage I've found in a natural protein blend. It mixes well with a very small amount of water and goes down easy. The only reason I am giving it a 4 out of 5 is the flavor...it tastes a tad like spoiled milk. Nothing over powering, but certainly noticeable."
5,Can't Tell The Difference,"I used to use ON Whey and decided to use the Natural Whey this time around. It tastes identical. I get the Strawberry flavor. The powder is a more white in the natural container versus pink in the regular whey containers. Once you add milk though, the powder turns pink. It has the same effect and is overall better for you. Amazon offers one of the most competitive prices with Prime so you beat tax and shipping charges. Overall, its hard to see my gain differences from regular ON Gold Whey because I cycled right on this one. I would recommend this and will continue to use this over any other whey out there."
4,"Great value, great taste","Great value considering you get pretty high quality protein with no artificial sweeteners. I think there are 2g of sugar in each scoop, which I'll let slide. Basically tastes like chocolate milk when you mix a scoop with 1-2 cups of milk. Very filling and can easily substitute a meal when you don't have time to prepare something or cook. Very happy with my purchse and I'll likely purchase other ON products in the future when I need to restock."
4,Good taste depending on how you mix it,"Good with water. Better with milk. Great with instant oatmeal. Doesn't work in yogurt. I liked the taste of the same brand Vanilla Ice Cream flavor better, but this one's not too bad."
5,"Tastes great, less shaking","Once I realized that most whey protein powder mixes contain artificial sugars and flavoring I sought out for an all natural solution and I ended up with Optimum Nutrition Natural Vanilla with much skepticism.However once I added this to my shake I noticed a huge difference. It tastes much better, it mixes much more smoothly and is all around superior.I highly recommend it."
4,Good source of protein,"This is one of the better protein powders I've taken. It packs 24 grams of protein per serving. That's very helpful when you have to take 200+ grams of protein a day. It mixes fairly easily with vigorous shaking. Some lumps though. All in all, well rounded supplement that's economic."
4,Good price and product,Good quality and quantity for the price. Mixes fairly easily and has good flavor. I'd recommend it and purchase again.
2,Wrong flavor came in,"ordered it in strawberry but the vanilla flavor came in. lucky that i kinda like vanilla but whatever, 20 bucks is a decent price. fast shipping too. now i have to deal with vanilla(bleh) for a month since i dont like the hassle of shipping it back."
2,Not Very Good!,"I read a couple reviews for the Optimum whey protein, reading that it was one of the best tasting products out there. I decided to try the 100% natural whey protien and was NOT impressed! When I got this product I expected it to be a little different because it was all natural but I did not expext it to taste as bad as it did. Mixed with just water or milk the taste is horrible! Mixed with bananas however, tastes very well."
4,Good Stuff,"I think that this protein is tasty for being 100% natural. That being said I think there are better tasting protein drinks that are not 100% natural. So, if you want natural this product is the way to go. If you want taste you may want to look elsewhere. I actually make frozen drinks with this protein and when you do that, you can't tell the difference in taste anyway."
5,Dont buy for taste....or smell,"Alright, well, since its natural, it tastes pretty much like nothing. And smells kinda bad. I personally will be switching back to the Gold Standard Double Rich chocolate, but if youre someone who doesnt care for taste, then this is perfect for you. Great product, just not for me though, i will gladly take the artificial sweetners over this stuff. If im gonna drink something everyday, it should taste good."
5,NO artificial flavors or sweetners,"Natural or 'clean' protein powders are hard to find. The ON natural is tasty, mixes easily and is reasonably priced. It's pretty much straight up whey protein...We add vanilla to our plain, instant oatmeal in the mornings (instead of buying the sugar laced flavored crap) in addition to flax, wheat germ and fruit. Good way to start the day. Just be sure you mix the oatmeal and protein together before you pour on the boiling water or you will have clumps. The chocolate is also excellent, and usually what I use for smoothies with soy milk, a frozen banana and a tsp or so of peanut butter."
1,Terrible taste,"Usually optimum nutrition products are the highest in quality, but this specific protein and flavor is one of the worst iv ever had"
1,Stevia is in this protein,I do not reccomend buying this product if you get headaches from Stevia. They just put a different name for Stevia on the ingredients label.-Jason
2,Formula altered and tastes terrible now,"I used to take this when the melamine breakout was running rampant. The same time my cats kidneys began to fail and I became extremely lean while drinking this along with Muscle Milk. Since then, which was a couple of years ago the flavor has changed from ok to worse. I used to mix it the the MM, but now can't stand to because the taste is so bad. MM still tastes the same. I use this with milk and bananas and it still tastes bad. Of course this review is based on a personal preference and I can't vouch to the results of this product, but if you liked it in the past and have not had any for a while, don't expect it to be the same."
1,###This product has cancer causing soy lecithin..####,"This product has cancer causing soy lecithin. I just had a cancerous kidney removed because of soy lecithin found in Protein bars and Drinks I've used over the years. Do some research. I wish I had. I'm finding out that soy lecithin is in almost every sports nutrition supplement, especially Protein Drinks."
4,"Natural, safe, and high in protien","I was lead to this item by a free bodybuilding website made by a man named Scooby. He Suggested this protein because he doesn't trust artificial products, and I don't blame him. This product did the job it was supposed to, High protein for low calorie and natural."
4,"Tastes ok, mixes well","Normally I purchase the double rich chocolate flavor, but since this was on sale I decided to give it a shot. It is not as tasty, but mixes very well in water, milk, or juice."
4,100% Natural Whey Protein - Optimum Nutrition,"I've consumed Optimum Nutrition products for years now. Since I take one or 2 servings daily of the 100% Whey Protein, it's important for me to consume a product with the least amount of artificial ingredients, and this one fits the bill."
4,"best, but not delicious.","ON 'gold standard 100% whey protein' is the best if you like natural additives with only 2 grams of sugar per serving (sweetened with 'stevia'). It mixes very well, the texture is that of water when 1 scoop is mixed with 8 ounces. The flavor is undoubtedly ""vanilla"", with the flavor of vanilla and texture of water... it tastes' like vanilla water, feels like it going down too. The sweet flavor of stevia is not like the sweet flavor of sugar. So, my thoughts on ""ON 100% whey"", its a great value while also being top quality, it is awesome that it is all natural with low carbs and low sugars, Mix in a blender with a banana to give it texture and a better flavor. Although the flavor is not THAT bad to begin with.~Ken of the kane"
3,Clumps,"Most Optimum Nutrition protein powders I've used tasted good and mixed very easily. For some reason the Natural Whey Vanilla does not mix well,left with big clumps,and doesn't have much flavor."
5,Easy and tastes good too,Mixes very easily with just a spoon. The chocolate flavor is pretty decent as well. You get a lot of servings for what you pay for. Recommended!
4,Right amount of sweetness,"I find most protein powders to be sickingly too sweet for daily consumption. Most of them make me feel like I just ate a chocolate cake. The fact that I find most chocolate cakes to be too sweet should warn you of my taste preferences. One of the reasons I purchased this over others was due to their use of Stevia and less sugar. I liked the end product very much and would have given 5 stars but I noticed on the ingredient list on the tub, there was no mention of Stevia. Due to that contradiction of disclosure, I took off a star."
2,Very dissapointed,I was very dissapointed when I got this product after I read a lot of reviews saying this is a great product so i ordered it. When I received it I noticed that it would not mix at all and clumped. I tried with a spoon but it left lots of clumps so i put it in my shaker and it still had clumps. I finally had to put in a blender and that got almost all of the clumps out but it whipped the milk making it hard to drink. The taste is great but for protein if you can get it to mix.
4,Its alright,"The vanilla flavor aint that great but hey, its protein powder in reality it should NOT taste great as the old saying ""if it tastes good, spit it out"" however if you're gunna buy this product make sure u have a strong stomach. it doesnt taste that good and its unpleasant. But if u need the protein i would suggest buying this with it being flavored as chocolate.overall i would say that its alright.I would recommend this to a friend."
5,Decent Whey Protein,I've been using this product for a while and like it more than other whey proteins. The flavor is better than most and I've tried my fair share of other products. I like to make it into a shake with fruit and have it for breakfast as a good start to my day.
3,Great product... if you don't mind the taste,"I have been using Optimum Nutrition whey protein for a couple years now and absolutely love it. I decided to try out this natural version to feed my curiosity. I went with the chocolate because that is what I normally get. While the results are the same, I can't wait to be done with this because the taste is absolutely horrible."
3,Taste Horrible,"I have just started using this a week ago, so I can't judge the effectiveness of it yet. But since this is ON, I believe that the quality is nothing to worry about. However, the bigger issue is that it taste really bland. I know that I am going to get a less tasty mix by going for an all-natural product, but I really can't stand the taste of this particular flavor. I'll switch back to the original chocolate for my next buy/"
2,Tastes really vile,"The price and everything is fine, and it's not a bad product, but it seems falsely advertised. It's really foul tasting, I mix it with unsweetened chocolate almond milk. It barely mixes with a shaker, still clumps kind of bad, but I usually drink it really fast in the morning for breakfast anyway.It tastes really awful. The stevia extract or whatever they use leaves the same sort of filmy taste in my mouth that artificial sweeteners leave, which is a pity. Had I known what it tasted like ahead of time, I would have just stuck with what I was using. I'll go through what I have, but I won't be buying it again."
4,"still the best protein powder, but the flavor is different","If you are looking for a product without artificial sweeteners, and not loaded with sugar, this is the product. I've used it off and on since it was first introduced. It always had an excellent taste and fulfilled the need for high protein, low carb, and easy on the wallet.I would give 5 stars, except this bottle tastes a little different than all the other bottles I've had, like maybe they have switched up something, and it does not taste as good as before. But with every competitive product seeming to be loaded with artificial sweeteners or tons of carbs, an athlete looking for low carb protein without artificial sweeteners is probably limited to this."
4,No artificial stuff!!,"Whey isolate is 90% pure protein by weight and provides 24g of protein per serving. I like this version since it contains no suger or artificial sweeteners. Stevia is a natural source of sweetness, but this product does not go overboard with it. I mix mine with fat free milk, a banana, frozen blueberries, a squirt of extra virgin olive oil and a tbsl of ground flax seed. Mixing this with milk is the best way to experience the full flavor potential of this powder. On the rare occasion I mix it with just water, the taste is pretty good and it goes into solution easily.Note that on all containers I tried, the seal under the cover was not completely sealed, but the outside seal wasn't broken so I never worried. I think this was caused by shifting of the powder during transit.Price is a bit high, but that is my only complaint."
4,"More protein, good taste","This product is superior to other whey protein products I've used. It has more whey protein, a bit of sugar to aid recovery, a good taste and dissolves quickly in cold water."
3,I really liked this product but not a fan of ingredients,Just a warning: This product contains Stevia. I am not a big fan of Stevia saying how some studies showed it as not the safest sweetener. If you don't mind Stevia then this is the best protein powder for you.
2,Awful taste,It smells awful. I have to hold my nose to drink it or I get nauseous. The non natural tastes phenomenal.
5,Great Product,"Not as sweet as their regular whey but I guess that's the point. I always use in my post-workout shake and it blends very well with no clumps. I really wanted a whey with no ""ose"" in the ingredients and Optimum works for price and quality. Very recommended and zero problems with my order!"
5,Best Naturally Flavored Protein Out There,"I've tried numerous protein powders, but this one is by far the best. And it's naturally flavored (no Nutrasweet or Splenda). Blends perfectly without clumping and absolutely delicious. I have two scoops every morning. Fantastic."
5,Delicious and effective,"Having just switched to whey from hemp protein, I wasn't sure what to expect, but god this stuff tastes good! Not too chalky either, and it mixes pretty well with water which my old stuff didn't. I dig it. Glad I bought so much. Also it shipped really quickly."
5,Good stuff,"This is a no brainer - tastes good, high protein content and all natural, with a price you cant beat."
5,Surprisingly Delicious,"I was a little nervous about buying this because of some reviews I read about the taste and the mixing. Because of what I'd read from independent sources about the high quality, I decided to give it a try. Wow! I was amazed at how good it tasted. And it's not too thick. It mixes great in both my shaker at the club and in my blender at home (of course, the blender is a little smoother, but the shaker isn't clumpy, just not as smooth). Even better than some other more expensive products. Tastes great when I mix it with water. On a day when I can have more carbs, tastes absolutely awesome with a little yogurt."
5,Great Product,"Don't believe the naysayers, if you mix this with almond or soy milk it tastes too good to be true!"
5,Best protein for the money,"I tried a lot of different proteins - Muscle milk, EAS whey etc before I settled on this one. While EAS from Sams club is definitely cheaper, I had a tough time digesting it. Optimum nutrition 100% natural whey goes down pretty well in my stomach. May be it is because of the enzyme lactase they add. In any event, it is 100% natural, no artificial sweetners and 24g of protein per scoop. What more could I ask for ?"
5,ON Natural Whey is Great,"I've used ON Natural Gold Standard Whey for years.Before that, I used ON Gold Standard Whey, and prior to that, many other proteins.I take it daily and did not want to keep consuming sucralose (ON Gold Standard Whey), so I switched to ""Natural.""It's a mix of whey isolate and concentrate at a good price.If you're really serious, you may want to look at just whey isolate, which is a bit more expensive for the volume.ON is a good brand.Gold Standard Whey is a quality product.Highly recommend."
5,Great product,Both the strawberry and vanilla shipped very fast and I was pleased with everything about the protein it is perfect but I do prefer the strawberry over the vanilla taste wise
2,Not that good of a protein,"I thought this would taste like most proteins but it didn't. To ""watered down"" even with milk and tastes horrible. Not enough sugar so you taste to much of the powder/protein. The taste isn't legit."
2,Hard to swallow,"I was very optimistic about this powder because of the great reviews. I almost threw up the first time i drank it. the label on the bottle says that it mixes well with just a spoon - it doesn't. also, the natural chocolate taste isn't very chocolatey. unfortunately i bought the 5 lb bottle and am trying to find different ways to be able to take it. so far putting it in chocolate pudding is the only thing that makes it palatable. i would not recommend this for taste or texture."
4,Very good taste,The taste is great but I have a slightly difficult time getting the powder to mix in if I only try to stir the drink and not blend it.
5,Great. Just what I wanted,Item was just as I wanted. No problems. Delivery was fairly prompt. Thanks for great service.
1,tastes bad,I've been using other ON products and I love them. They are really fair priced and good. But this onee.. It is terrible when you drink it with water. I sometimes mix it with yogurt and thats okay. Anyway good to use but it has a bad taste.
2,My seal was broken too!,"I think these guys need to get their act together. I read the other poor review about a broken seal, figured it was an isolated incident, and then when I got mine in the mail same thing!I unscrewed the cap and 1/2 of the seal popped off with it. I don't how bad this is, but I'm keeping it. You can't beat the price.For anyone who is bothered by a broken seal, or their product being compromised by one, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON!"
1,worst flavor ever,"hated the flavor. Didn't like it from the first scoop, and that's never good when you have a 5 lb bucket. the Chocolate coconut is my favorite"
5,Tasty!,"Had Designer Whey before this, but was looking for something with a higher protein count and no artificial sweeteners. I don't know if it's because I don't have much sugar in my diet, but I think it tastes really great! After I bought it, my friend who has Gold Standard - regular (French Vanila w/sucralose) gave us some of his for a taste comparison. His seemed way too sweet and and didn't mix as well as mine does.TL;DRTaste: 5.0 starsMixing: 3.5 starsFrench Vanilla Gold Standard - Regular w/SucraloseTaste: 3.5 starsMixing: 2.5 stars"
5,awesome product,I really enjoy this product because it is extremely versatile and gives whatever food you use it with a great taste. it also has a good flavor when drunk as a protein shake.
5,Good buy,"Good stuff, taste good with no unnatural sweetener taste but still very low fat & sugar, ship fast with bonus samples (with vendor Esther Hochstetler)."
5,prosource whey protein,Great product and fast shipping. I have been using this product with Decacor createne and have seen good results with building muscle. I recamend this product.
3,Not happy with the increase,"I used to pay $38.95 for 5 pound, strawberry flavored ones under ""Subscribe & Save"" plan almost one and half year ago. Now, it costs $52.99, and I think, the increase is just too much."
5,Very good- for daily use-clean-,"I like this powder a lot - you can feel it if you take it daily - and best thing is that it burns real clean. I have noticed other powders will put some weight on me due to caloric content but this stuff is very lean. That said -it is the kind of powder that has to be taken every day as it burns off and is not long range. It is also not as potent as Syntha 6 powder but that one will put on weight and I notice has some small after effects - (for me it causes small things like complexion is not as clear, slight bloating. and if its possible- dirty fingernails also-)Myotein XPI is longer range and also very lean stuff -it is also designed to be longer range-Again though-this is solid and packs a good amount of grams into scoop and is easily consumed-very very clean"
2,It was a entire year expired,I only gave them 2 stars because it came on time. other than that my experience would garner ZERO stars because it was a whole year past the expiration date... Just realized it about a month in to drinking the thing.
3,Tastes like trash,"This is a nice cheap product but you get what you pay for, the taste is TERRIBLE! Maybe one day I will try out a different flavor."
3,$10 increase from end of last year,"I brought this product at the end of last year and for $42 for 5lbs of ON whey that 5 stars. Now a little over half a year later the price has gone up 25%, sorry but price gouging. Still a great product but increase in price hard to over look."
3,Strawberry aftertaste is like old burnt tires,"That stench & aftertaste went away after it ""aired out"" for a day or so with the top off. Raised to 3 stars; pretty good now, but as high as I could rate after that 1st taste shock.It's got a mild strawberry flavor and a decent amount of sweetness at first, but watch out for that aftertaste. Yuk. Maybe it's the beet powder. I so hate beets. I'll blend it off with another one that's too sweet."
4,Good - not the best taste,This is a great natural whey product. The chocolate is the best by far. I purchased some on Amazon and it was excellent. I then purchased some vanilla from GNC because I had a coupon and of course it was horrible. It tastes like old milk and will not dissolve in liquid. I'm suspicious that it was old but due to this I will never try the vanilla again. I will continue to purchase the chocolate from Amazon and only Amazon due to the price being the best you'll find and if you do the recurring purchase you get a great deal for a great whey. Top quality from Amazon unlike the chain stores.
5,Excellent Supplement,"This powder is great! It mixes well with milk and helps me recover from an intense workout. Plus, since its completely natural, I recommend it to all my friends for the added health benefit."
4,"Doesn't taste as good as ""regular"" to me, but it's just protein","I got this product over the regular, non-natural version because I wanted something more ""natural"". I realized I don't like the flavor as much as the non-natural version (it actually tastes a little unnatural to me). However having said this, as the protein in it is the most important thing to me, I would purchase the less expensive version the next time I need protein."
4,Good protein for the price,"While I prefer the NOW whey isolate, they were out of stock so this was the next best thing (the NOW has potassium, and a couple other benefits). Mixes well, tastes good, I use it in my spinach/fruit smoothies, good stuff."
5,Good stuff,I love their french vanilla and natural chocolate flavors. I can get 32g of protein from a single glass of milk! Without the extra added sugar!
4,Teller's inspiration to others,"Edward Teller was the founder of the American hydrogen bomb and a longtime controversial figure in the intersection of science and politics. One of the seminal figures in the American physics community. So this book celebrates his 80th birthday with a compendium of research papers.Those of you interested in Teller's achievements may want to peruse these articles. While not written by Teller, they indicate how he provided inspiration to the many authors, and undoubtedly to others.Also, ironically, the occasion was almost at the end of the Cold War. In retrospect, very apropos for Teller. For his career spanned this War, and he was one of the keynote participants."
3,not connected,I chose this book for a class i had to take. I did not see the connection between Marxism and Black Theology.
2,A Little Disappointed...,"I had read (online) a lot of good things about this DVD. However, either I misunderstood the target audience, or I'm a lot better at hand percussion than I thought!I was under the impression that the intended audience was not the beginner, but more of an intermediate player. As such, it seems that the majority of the folks would already be intimately familiar with setting up congas, basic hand techniques, the (widely used) tumbao conga pattern, tambourine/shaker usage, etc.While I did learn a few useful things, I really feel that the Kalani ""Ultimate Conga/Bongo Jam"" series were much more informative and useful for those who are qualified to swim in anything deeper than the kiddie pool."
3,Very Unbasic Freud,"Frued's approach to sex and psychoanalytic interpretations are legendary and changed the culture we live in. They tend to be Id-based theories, but interesting nevertheless. Freud's ""principles"" like libidinous sexual urges that operate without benefit of developmental growth a' la Erik Erikson, permeate modern thinking and language (""the Freudian slip"") even though they fell out of favor to some more modern interpreters like Carl Jung, Eric Erickson, and Object Relations experts like Donald Winnicott. This offers some particular insights. -PJ Adams, author of Freud's Revenge"
2,"OOOH, SO Close...","The Tubes were the greatest live rock show ever, but even the best have their ""better"" years. This tour of the ""Remote Control"" album seems to have fallen between their outrageous ""older"" days that made them famous as a live act, and their more ""polished"" tours starting with ""The Completion Backward Principle"" album. This tape lacks a good deal of the bite that I expected, but is still entertaining. A lame and overlong and purposely-edited version of ""What Do You Want From Life?"" makes for the lowest point on the tape, and Fee plays everything too squeaky-clean IMHO, but most things hold up well enough. If you've never been a Tubes fan, you'll be impressed, if you are an Old Tubes Fan, like me, you'll wish they'd taped a tour about 2-3 years earlier!"
5,One of the essential albums of '80's metal,"In the '80's metal movement Queensryche is often overlooked in favor of bands like Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Megadeth, but with their album ""Operation: Mindcrime"" Goeff Tate and company show that they belong in that elite group. This album combines Black Sabbath with Pink Floyd and forms one of the greatest concept albums ever, inspiring later efforts by Dream Theater and King's X in their progressive metal efforts. No heavy metal collection is complete without this album."
5,best,"I'll keep it simple. This is one of thetop 10 best albums OF ALL TIME. It is thatgood, and I mean the whole thing.Own it."
5,Shear Brilliance!!,"Somebody should make a movie using the lyrics and music from this album. Not since The Wall, has an entire concept album told such a riveting tale using every single song without straying off course. Mindcrime is in my all-time top 10, and it will never be replaced. (unless 8-tracks come back)"
5,Great,Love this album and it is hard to find in stores. I am glad I found it at such a resonable price. Shipping was great and speedy.
5,Great transaction,"I purchased this as a gift, great ease making this purchase and quick shipping. I wouldn't hesitate making another purchase."
4,A Reason To Revisit Mindcrime,"For those of you that haven't heard, Queensryche is coming out with Operation: Mindcrime II sometime this year. If you caught them live recently, this would explain the ""2nd-half"" of the show. Something to remind you of what's coming! If you didn't catch the show and don't yet have this album or DVD, then I suggest you get on the ball before the new album hits. After all, you don't want to be left out in the cold staring into ""The Eyes Of A Stranger"", do you?"
5,better than Livecrime,I read some negative reviews but being a huge QR fan I had to buy it. I don't have videocrime so that is cool to have. The live concert however I like better than Livecrime. It is a year earlier and you can tell. Geoff's voice is just better. He sings a much better representation of Mindcrime. Yes Livecrime may be a bit more polished but it is supposed to be. It is from two nights put together. It isn't actually a straight through concert. This one is. One night. A couple missed notes here and there but that's real. Geoff doesn't lower near as many parts vocally. I Don't Believe in Love and Eyes of a Stranger are sung perfectly. You can tell the tour took a little from him if you listen to both this and Livecrime. The sound I thought is also pretty good. I didn't have a problem with it. It didn't sound like a bootleg or anything. I love it.
1,Pretentious Garbage,"If you love music with every ounce of joy and emotion wrung out of it, then this record is for you. This is a perfect example of a band that takes themselves far too seriously. Queensryche is obviously inspired by Pink Floyd, but everything that makes Pink Floyd great (good taste, humor, originality, pop sensibility) is totally lacking in this record. OK, I will concede that if you are a Metal junkie who likes theme-albums for their own sake and musicians with good chops that like to show off (for the sake of showing off) then this is a must-listen. I had a neighbor that thought this was the greatest album ever. He once said to me, ""Music isn't supposed to be FUN; music is supposed to be SERIOUS!"" I guess you are pathologically impaired from enjoying music, then you won't mind listening to music that brings no enjoyment to the listener. But, on another level, this music can be enjoyed. That is, for the sheer hilarity of the stupid, over-bearing story that goes with the songs."
1,This is what you should get if you're a joke with no taste,"This album doesn't make any sense at all!! The songwriting is crap and this Tate guy just can't sing. All this is is another co-called ""classic"" that is nothing more than throw-away junk. When was the last time you saw any of these songs played on the TV or radio?? For a real concept album get Usher's Confessions or The Streets - A Grand Don't Come For Free. Now those are GOOD concept albums that are more ground braking than this unknown tripe."
5,definitive concept album,"This album is the definitive concept album - Queensryche's polical lyrics really put together a powerful storyline that grabs the attention of the listener. Such a complicated story for me to understand at first but I love this music and the story as well! They need to make a movie off this album kinda like a Pink Floyd thing. I bet this would make a good movie: Operation Mindcrime. This is great progressive metal writing (more like lyric writing) but the music itself is heavy as well - this is Queensryche's best album along with ""Empire"". If you love Prog. and concept albums be sure to get this when you can because this concept is great. I'm not spoiling so you gotta get this thing for yourself, man!!!"
2,great album - but this particular vinyl release is a bust,"I was really excited to purchase this album on vinyl and in fact always seeing it in the record store was one of the reasons I decided to jump into vinyl and get a turntable. So when I finally picked up this Capitol Records ""from the vault"" edition I was expecting awesome soundSo I was pretty disappointed to hear very poor sound and numerous pops, clicks, hisses and general surface noise - even after cleaning it. the retailer was a good sport and let me swap it out for another one but it didn't sound any better.So even though the album is awesome I would strongly avoid this particular release. If at all possible find a copy of the original vinyl release from the 80's - much better."
5,The perfect album,"Amazing, great, perfect.There you have it in three words.Wonderfully crafted, each song speaks on so many levels. Great muscianship, great lyrics and vocals, great mixing and sound quality. I really can't say enough about this album. If you like Queensryche at all, you'll adore this album. If you like Metal/Hardrock you should love this album. If you were a fan of any 80's or early 90's hard rock at all, this should at least be something you really like.Sounds like some of the best Dream Theater or Def Lepard ever made."
2,Definately milking it,"I love the original album. One of my favorites of all time. But this is a sorry excuse for a DVD package. I just don't understand why they didn't redo the music for the videos. Mono sound? Give me a break! How hard could it possibly be? They're probably planning on redoing it again with stereo or 5.1 in some super deluxe package so I have to buy it again! And the live album isn't that good either. I have every version this came out on, including the Livecrime CD version from way back. If you have that, I really don't see the need to buy this.Stick with the remastered CD and don't bother with this. Or better yet, save your money and buy the Revolution Calling box set and you'll get all of their EMI remastered albums. You can get it through a CD club for less than half the amazon price and it's a better value than this."
3,Operation Corporatecrime,"I bought this way back when it had just been released on VHS. This blew my mind away. It was and probably still is one of my favorite live albums and perfomances. Anyone who was a Queensryche fan should have already had the VHS version. I am glad now that it came out on DVD but I must say that I am very disappointed. What is so special about this deluxe edition...The slipcase. Cmon. The sound quality of the concert is poor for a dvd format. Not even in Stereo. If you havent bought this boxset yet, dont. Buy the VHS edition instead."
5,I guess i'll add another 5 star review to the collection,"GREAT cd. I love the story, its really intriguing. I love the vocal bits in front of the songs, and Tate really does live up to the praise he gets. I'm fascinated by concept albums (Scenes from a Memory by Dream Theater is my favorite album of all time) this album is very good. Tate is phenomenal, and the instrumentalists (while they can't match DT's virtuosity) are good and still very fun to hear. If you like good rock, (TALENTED rock mind you, no Good Charlotte) and/or concept albums, this is for you."
2,Disappointingly Generic,"A coworker loaned me this CD with the promise that he was doing me a favor I didn't yet realize. I have to disagree, though, because this album is nothing special. It all sounds exaclty like any other music you'd expect to hear from this era, and could easily be mistaken as Def Leppard or Poison by the casual listener. There's nothing really bad in here, but there's also nothing to make you sit up and take notice. None of the songs really differentiate themselves if you listen to the album straight through, and the album itself just seems lackluster and monotonous. It's OK, but I can think of a lot of things I'd recommend before it."
2,terrible!,there's some great lyrics like suite sister mary but the rest of the songs are gospel! why? the vocals are quite good!
4,Darkly entertaining,"I just want to say first of all that I'm just starting to get into the harder rock area of music. For years I've been more of a pop/light rock listener. However I've lately been trying to expand my musical horizons so I asked my younger brother to recommend some music. This was one of the first albums he suggested, so I gave it a listen. Then I arranged to buy it. What a great album! In addition to catchy, edgy music, the album tells a story about conspiracy, brainwashing, evil and the descent into despair. Not a great subject area to get drawn too deeply into, but very entertaining to get a glimpse of. Queensryche has done an excellent job of creating mood and telling a story without bogging down the album."
4,A great storyline CD,"Operation Mindcrime offers so much more than just hard rock! It offers a great story (from beginning to end) of a man who is brainwashed into commiting political murders to make DR. Evil's fantasy world come true. It also offers the great voice of Geoff Tate, who shows off his operatic background, as well as some of the tightest guitar playing around. It is heavy metal with a hint of a soft side. A great CD for any rock fan!"
5,The best album of the Century.,"Simply the best album of all times, no heavy metal band has achieved so much as Queensryche has with this masterpiece, even if you are not a Metalhead, you HAVE to listen to this masterpiece, it is rich in every way, lyrics, guitars, bass, drums, and, of course ...the incredible and potent vocals of Geoff Tate. A must."
5,Greatest Music of the Modern Era,"Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime is a modern masterpiece. Tate's vocals are insurpassable.The only singer whose voice gives me chills.Degarmo and Wilton are genious on the guitars, the solos will blow you away.not to mention the killer performances of Rockenfeld on drums and Jackson on bass. The song writing is extrordinary, the story grabs you and you can't turn it off until its done. And then you want to play it again!This has been my my favorite CD for the last ten years, I never grow tired of it."
1,Operation: Online Crime,This is not the real remastered edition...the sound hurts my ears and is really bad with my headphones. Just buy the original cd and rip the music that way. Amazon needs to fire their sound mixer.
1,"I loved the Original CD, this one is Awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I thought I would buy the RE-MASTERED CD and get a better Sonic quality. What I found to my Shock and Horror, is that they introduced so much digital clipping and distortion that I can not stand to listen to this version.Don't get me wrong, I think this is one of THE GREATEST albums ever made in it's original release.I even exchanged the cd for another thinking it was a problem with the disk, but this did not help, as they all have the hidious distortion.I tried to contact the record company, but there is no way to get a hold of anyone to let them know someone really screwed up on this album.There is Clipping, Sizzling, and clicks that are not in the original release.Listen to the beginning of ""I don't believe in Love"" and you will hear all kinds of sizzle and crunch. This is all throughout this CD.Whom ever Re-mastered this cd should be shot"
2,1/2 Disappointed,"After reading all of the info. available, I was under the assumption that I would be receiving the 2 cd's. And the DVD that was the MOVIE.. Not short clips of said Movie. :("
5,Operation Mindcrime,"Awesome Metal Anthem album. Songs speak of political change through assassination, control, love, dispare and dissolution. Great writing, hooks and performances. One of the best albums from the late 80's early 90's."
3,Preety good one,This album depicts the band's ferocity which is conveyed to the listener by shocking lyrics regarding the existing corruption in the American system. I don't consider this album a 5 star mainly because it doesn't follow the prior albums' heavy metal standards.
4,Intriguing.,"A little jumbled, but overall quite good. Not a fan of the lead singers vocal style, but I'll get over that. If you like concept albums than feast until you explode. Enjoy!"
5,Very good!!! Can't wait to start second one!!!,"Well I didn't know that the movie The Princess Diaries was based on these series of books! My sister is the one who introduced me, and she and I are in our 20's but we still read them. There fun to read and the story in the book seems better than the movie so far. Its interesting to see the differnece but also I still enjoy the movie but reading is so much more fun because then you can imange the people yourself. I love this book, can't wait to read the next one."
3,Okay story likely to surprise fans of the movie,"While I enjoyed this book, some parents may take issue with some of Mia's more blunt commentary about her life. The movie may spark the interest of younger readers who will be surprised by what they find.I'm not sure if this specific version has received an update treatment. However, in the version I read, the numerous pop culture references make the text seem dated and are likely to cause confusion for teens who barely remember the 1990s."
5,great for any reader.,"These books are great for any reader. I think the book mainly focuses around middle school and high school though since in the start I believe she was in 8th grade maybe 7th... Sorry, it's been a month or so since I read this. I'm up to book 5. again. :) Anyways, I started reading these around High School. I think that's when they were published because I remember having to wait on the last 3 or 4 to read. Anyways, That would be around 2004-2008. Those were the years I was in High School. I have read them each about 5 times since. I have lost count because my books have been read so much. These books are good for any reader young to old. Maybe just from middle school and up though because they do talk about their boyfriends and french kissing, and other stuff. If you like these, I would also recommend Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."
5,"Very, Very, Very Cool","I purchased this book at the local book store in the small town I live in...after I had seen the movie, hoping for a good read on our vacation to the Cariboo. Well, duh! I sure got one.As soon as Mia whisps you away into her world, you love the book. Mia, the fourteen year old heir to the throne of Genovia has alot of problems. Her mom dating one of her teachers , her grandmother with tattooed eye liner (what's with that?) and princess lessons, and all the media attention. But, she some how gets through all of it.It's nothing like the movie...so if you've seen it, your in for a surprise, and that's all I'm going to say!"
5,A Great Book,"this book is about a teenage girl who is flat chested and a freshman in highschool everyone thinks that shes a freak but shes real cool and one day her father tells her shes the heir to a small european country and suddenly she is popular.this book is soooooooooooooooooooooo great its very funny meg cabot is a great author...the second one [is] princess in the spotlight...and its also realy great ,and shes writing the third one called princess in love and im sure it will be great too.and theres the movie coming out this august."
3,not what i expected,"This book was not what I expected because I had seen the movie beforehand, and there are a lot of major changes. Mia Thermoplis is a regular teenager, failing algebra and drooling of Josh, the hottest guy in school who's going out with Lana, the snobbiest chearleader of the bunch. When Mia finds out she is really a princess of Genovia, her Grandmere comes to give her princess lessons.When the press finds Mia, they are extremely agraviated. To see what happens, if Mia will accept being the Crown Princess of Genovia, read this book."
5,Keeps you laughing!!!,"This book is about Mia Thermopolis regular girl, until her father comes to town and tells her she is a princess. So on top of dealing with the normal teenage problems(like her mom dating her algebra teacher)she has to worry about princess lessons. I really loved this book! It was so totally awesome that I could not put it down. I bought it yesterday at like 5 and finished around 7! I would reccommend this book to anyone over the age of about 12-13!! GREAT BOOK!!"
3,"cute, but not for kids","The Princess Diaries is the endearing tale of Mia Thermopolis, a shy, unpopular girl who suddenly discovers she is the heir to the throne of a small country.The book is written as Mia's diary and describes her struggles, both internal and external. Issues such as her mother's dating life, her academic problems, her hopeless crush on a senior boy, and her quarrels with her best friend make the story realistic, while her identity as Princess of Jenovia adds a fun and interesting twist that appeals to most girls. The book is humorously written and easy to read.The only real flaw this book has is that some of the material is not suitable for younger readers. There are many sexual references and some subject matter that is probably best left for more mature readers, which is a shame because the idea of the book has so much appeal to young girls.All in all, the book was cute. I don't think I'll read the rest of the series, but I did enjoy this one."
5,Enjoyable book,The reason why I enjoyed this book so much was because it is neat that just an average girl found out that she is a princess. It is like a dream come true. The other thing I liked was that the book was written in a diary form. The part of the book that I disliked was when everyone knew Mia was a princess everyone started treating her differently and noticing her. My favorite character in this story is Mia. The reason why I like is that she is a very strong person and she can make a bad situation into a good one. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is very easy to read. When you read this book you will be glad that you chose this book. What is neat about this book is there a lot of series that go along with this book.. There is also a movie about this book. So it is neat to see if anything is the same or different as the book So you can see how the character is growing and how or if anything is changing. I hope you would give this book a try because it is worth reading.
3,"Okay, not the best","This book was not nearly as good as I expected. The overall plot is boring (not-so-attractive girl like oh-so-hot guy, girl gets made over, gets asked out by guy, finds out guy is a jerk and thus becomes a ""deeper"" person). I also found the lead character to be shallow, although she did improve as the book went on. The entire first half of the book consists of the vocabualry ""whatever"" ""like, HELLO"" and ""yeah right"" repeated continusously. On the up side, the princess theme was pretty funny (although there's absolutely no way the lead character WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED that something was different about her dad. No one is that dumb.) But it was still enjoyable enough. Some good characters were Lars, her bodyguard, Grandmere, her grandmother and my favorite character, and Tina, a girl she becomes friends with during the book."
3,Funny...but fluffy.,"Okay, I liked the book. I liked it very much. It was very funny and Mia had a distinct voice. However, it was fluffy. And fluffy is a BAD adjective for me to use for a book.As a previous reviewer said, Mia is just like every other teenaged girl in the world except she happens to be a princess. She has a mother and a father and a best friend. She hates her hair. She hates her body. She worries about the size of her breasts. She has a massive crush on a popular guy who doesn't know she's alive.If it wasn't for the princess thing (and it wasn't realistic; how could Mia have known her father 14 years and not figured it out?) this novel would be just another fluffy adolescent-angst story with nothing distinctive about it.Which isn't to say I didn't like the book. I did, and I will watch the movie and probably read the sequel too."
1,Awful with a capital A!,"Even though I kind of liked this book when I first read it, looking back... It's ridiculous.Mia Thermopolis is an average, geeky, 14 year old girl who discovers that her Grandmother is the Queen of a small country, Genovia, and she (Mia) is an heiress to the throne.Sure, the plot sounds great, but it wasn't written well at all. Mia is TOO obsessed with her body and complains often about her breast size. There's also the fact that she has very little respect for adults, mostly her Grandmother.I will also warn you on the content of this book. It's shocking that this book was created for young girls, if you were to go by all of the extra thrown-in innuendos. There's talk about her Mother sleeping with her math teacher, a foot fetishist stalking her best friend, plus many sex-based conversations. There was a ripe level of swearing, too.This book is a complete waste of time... however, I recommend it if you want to reduce your IQ level."
4,A good book for girls.,This book is alright. Mia is a typical girl with an average life until her father lets her know she's a princess. The book is a lot better than the movie.
5,14 year old reader from TN,"I think I would have to say this is one of my most favorite books of all time! It is soooo funny!! And it is A LOT better the movie. I am now reading the second book to the series, and it is just as good."
4,a fun easy read,The princess diaries is a great book for young teenagers. it really teaches great lessons on growing up and what girls have to deal with. this book is easy to read and cheerful. i would recomend this book to all my friends.
5,great book,this book the princess diaries is one of the best books i have ever read! i really liked it. i read all three when i had pneumonia and they really cheered me up. they are really funny and quirky.
5,Princess Diaries,"Meg Cabot's Princess Diaries is my favorite book right now. It's so much better than the movie (quite an understatement). If you liked the movie, you'll absolutely love this book. It's written in diary form, and like she's talking to you. It's hard to put down. I finished it in 3 days (I had to go to school. Sob...sob.).I can totally relate to Mia, not that I'm a princess or anything, but she's just so normal and real."
4,Really Fun,"I read this book in one day. It was really light and fun and it was really great to read about how Mia--a sort of flakey teenager deals with her problems that are sometimes really funny. So many books are weighed down by heavy problems like drugs, and death and abuse,and suicide, rape that it's refreshing to hear about Mia's life. Although her life is not simple, her problems are so outrageous that you just want to laugh about them. Even though most people probably can't relate to the princess part in the book, i'm sure most people can relate to not doing well in a class or problems with your best friend, or having a crush on an older guy, and the way Mia tells it through her journal is really funny and real. Meg Cabots writing is sounds like a real teenager, making the story so easy to relate to. So if you're looking for a really quick, easy, fun book to read this is a great pick!"
2,It was okay.,"But it wasn't what I expected. It really wasn't that much about Mia being a princess. It was just a typical nerdy girl wants the hunky guy kind of story. The princess thing was really kind of background, like Mia's got all these typical teenaged problems and oh, by the way, she's also a princess. And I thought Mia whined a lot."
4,"This book was very good, but its not a Pulitzer Prize!","Hi. I just finished this book and I did enjoy it. I thought it had a very cute plot, and its storyline was very interesting, but the storyline was especially easy to follow. It's not really what you would call ""active reading,"" but I did like most of the characters except for Mia's mom. She kind of got on my nerves. One thing I did notice is that it was slightly bias towards cheerleaders, and I being a cheerleader didn't really like that part. Overall I thought the book was a good read and fun. I recommend it for any girl who wishes they were a princess."
2,"See the Movie, It's so Much Better.","The book, The Princess Diaries, was an ok book. I do not think the author did a good job on planing how different events happen in the book. I think the way the events happened were unrealistic. When Mia's school finds out she is a princess, I think that if you found out that someone in your school was royalty you would do a little bit more then point and stare. I also don't think Mia's grandmother should have been so mean to her. Any grandmother, even a queen, would never be that mean to her granddaughter. I also don't think other people should read this book because it isn't that interesting. When something major happens it goes by way to fast. This is a book you can skip."
1,Feel your IQ points drop as you read...,"This is a rare case in which the movie is better than the book. Instead of having morals like the movie, about being whatever you want to be, instead the character obsesses (whines and whines and whines) about her looks (oh, yeah, she's a *real* role model for girls her age) and her boyfriends Cabot so many cliches about teens its not even funny. This book is one of the reasons why the English language is deteriorating."
4,"I know this book is for teens, but...","it was a fun read. It caught my attention after I heard about the movie coming out. I was curious, so what the heck? I can hardly wait for my daughter to get old enough to read it. It's a cute book, looking forward to the film (a guilty pleasure, ok?)."
5,Hysterical! The Best!,"This was one of my favorite books that I have ever read. It was so funny that at some points I had to put the book down and just laugh. But there was a problem. When I was laughing I didn't want to put the book down. If you are a 14 year old girl, or about that age, and aren't quiet sure about where you fit, you will love this book. I thought I was reading a diary of my self, minus the part of me becoming a princess of a small country. I am so excited for the second book to come out. I hope Meg Cabot puts it on order faster. Also hurry up b/c this book is also turinging into a movie. If that always spoils it get to it fast.Have a great time reading the book. You will enjoy it."
5,*One of the Best Books I've Ever Read!!~,Mia Thermopolis was nothing untill she found out she was a princess. That is Princess of a whole country. It may be a small country but thats still a whole country. Her mom also starts going out with her teacher. Nothing could be worse for Princess Mia. Her grandmother is nothing but a witch who thinks Mia should act like a princess. Then a bunch of reporters start taking pictures of the princess. Not only that but she has a big crush on the most popular guy in school. He is tall dark and hansom. He asks her to the dance. Of course Mia says yes. When the reporters show up her crush ends up kissing Mia infront of everyone and Mia is hummiliated. She has never kissed anyone. Really the only reason her crush asked her out was to get some publicity. How will she deal with it all being a tall flat chested unpopular girl in the 9th grade who is failing algebra.
5,The princess diaries,"The princess diaries is such a good book!Ive never read a that book had action,drama, and one well a little bit about romance. Mia Thermopolis is a freshmen at the Cultural University High School,she is a 5 foot 9 and is flat chested.Everyone at her shool thinks she is a freak.Her mother is dating her algebra teacher Mr.Giannini,and her father tells her she is the princess of Genovia.Mia has to acept her new life but when she finds out that Josh Ricterthe cutest and most popular boy asks her out but then he only asked her out to get his face on the news paper she gets mad and dumps him. ""I recommend this book for all ages!!!""Read it i know you'll love it, trustme!!!"" Virginia Contreras"
5,Meg Cabot Rocks!,"Mia Thermopolis is an ordinary 14 year old with huge feet, long height and pretty much flat whose mom is dating her teacher. The one who teaches a subject she flunks. Algebra.All that is about to change.Mia learns that her father is not able to have other children. More importantly, she learns that he is a prince and since he can't have any more kids, she is heir to the throne.Soon she must endure painful encounters with the press, useless princess lessons from Grandmere, her grandmother with tatooed eyebrows, her crush on both the boyfriend of her enemy and her best friend's brother, and not having a date for the Cultural Diversity dance."
4,Cute and Quick Princess Book.,"After having seen the movie a few times, I needed something to give me a good pick me up after a bad week. This book has is a good laugh at times.There are major differences between the movie and the book, but I felt that at times the movie was more better then the book.Mia is 15 and feel like she is a nobody in this world, her and friend Lily live there lives normally, but Mia wants to fit in with the some of the popular people. As she realizes that it isn't going to happen.Then along comes her Grandmere and father to tell Mia something that will change her life forever and she will never just be plain old Mia.Overall this book was wonderful, I found it focused more on her life then it did with her being a Princess, but I suppose there will be more about her being a Princess in the upcoming books."
5,A great read!,"While the movie did change a lot of the aspects of the book, I still enjoyed both. I think, though, that if I had 2 choose between the two, it would be the book. I can relate to Mia a lot. I really like her funny, realistic reactions to different things (""WHAT??? A PRINCESS??? ME??? Yeah. Right."" and ""OH MY GOD!!!!!!"" several times. :D) I can't wait 2 read the second volume."
5,Very entertaining!,"Great book, great story, great plots, great princessy personality, great funny lines!...hey, you know how the story goes right?"
4,Great book!,"Who: Amelia ThermopolisWhat: She's a princess of Genovia and her parents have been hiding it from her 'til now, her 16th birthday.When: Who knows? Her 16th birthday.Where: Finding out she was a princess in New York, and staying summer at Genovia, and also princess lessons with Grandmere.Why: Her dad can't have anymore kids; he has some freaky cancer. And she is the only heir to throne."
3,not worth rereading,The Princess Diaries is about Mia who finds out that she's a princess. It deals with he first month or so after finding out. For once the movie is much better than the book.
4,Very cute,This is so strange I had no idea that this was a series of books. I just thought it was a cute movie that I liked. I was at a thrift store and found book 4 and 5 in the series and started to look on my kindle for this. I was so surprised at how much a delight this book was to read from the start to the finish and so want to read the rest of the series now. It is such a quick read and keeps you moving. I love this and wish the movie would have stuck to the book but was refreshing the way it was written .
5,"A fun, light read","This is a great book that deals with an unrealistic situation (a teenage girl suddenly finding out she is a princess) realistically. Mia not only deals with all the problems surrounding that revelation, but with the same issues of friendship and first crushes that all teenagers face.Meg Cabot perfectly captures and the drama and angst in a teenager's life. The only potential problem with the longevity of this book is the constant pop culture references that may quickly become out of date. (But kudos to Ms. Cabot for knowing so much pop culture!)"
3,"funny,exciting,outgoing,depressing","Mia Thermopolis is having a rough time right now. Her mom is going out with her algebra teacher Mr.Gianini. And she does not like the idea of that all. But besides that Mia kind of has a normal life with friends like Lilley, and Lilley's brother Michael Moscovisz. And also she has some little love problems with a guy from school named Josh Ritcher. He is supposed to be the hottest guy in school and the most athletic and everything else. But she is in love with him and she thought that he did not even know that she existed. To find out more about this story you have to read the book."
4,Princess in the Sportlight,"i have never read a book that related to me so much! ever since the age of nine, my favourite books were diaries. i enjoyed living someones elses life, but i soon out grow the books. thanks to meg cabot, i can start reading my favourite kind of books again!"
1,Overrated,"I watched the movie first and I liked it so I thought that I would read the book and see if it was as good as the movie. Unfortuantely, it isn't. This first volume wasn't too bad, but the consequent books were terrible, despicable, redundant, boring. It seems like all that she cares about in all of the boooks is her boyfriend. Whether she's going to lose him, if he actually loves her, if they'll go to the dance together ect. It gets very dreary and I regret even picking up the books. It seems as though after the original book, Meg Cabot lost her steam and started fixating on a few specific points, including her boyfriend. I apologize for anyone who liked this, but I think this series is drivel. Very annoying. Not worth the money"
1,Very Dissapointing,"After seeing the Disney production of this book, I was very excited to read the adventures of Mia and her crazy life. However, this book did not live up to even one of my expectations. It was not worth my time or money. The movie is wonderful and apropriate for all ages. However, there is no way I would let a twelve year old read this book. It is too crude for any of my ""princesses"" to read. Instead of being inspireing about how anyone can become what ever they want, I found pages of an annoying young girl who is too concered about the size of her chest and whether or not her algabra teacher is ""frenching"" her mother. Do not waste your time ont this book."
1,OBSCENE!!!,"My eight year old sister bought this book, thinking that it had SOME relationship with the movie she liked so much. She read it very quickly, so I read it myself, on the offchance an older reader might enjoy it. I was appalled. Within the first two chapters, this book discusses sex, testicular cancer, and it actually describes the main character remembering finding her mother's diaphragm in the shower. Throughout this entire book (I find myself hesitating to call this piece of trash a book, by the way) are vulgar references to sex and the main character's sexual feelings, thoughts and fantasies. This book does not deserve to be on bookstore shelves masquerading as a book for young readers."
1,I weep for the future,"After reading the reviews of this book by my peers, I am more concerned than ever about the mental stagnation of teenagers. I can't believe all these girls are lapping up this tripe. The struggle to change perceptions about body images and individuality is already lost if teens are this undemanding about the kind of crap they read. Books like this are part of the problem when good books can be part of the solution. Wise up, girls. A real princess could spot this rotten pea under the mattress."
1,Totally inappropriate for teens! Not recommended,"I did not like this book, probably because I had such high expectations, but also because it was NOT appropriate for pre & young teens. I was expecting a great chick lit /coming of age, that was as wonderful as the movie. I give the movie 5 stars, and I have to give the script writer for the movie many kudos for coming up with such a great movie from this lousy book.Usually it's the movie that doesn't live up to the book's expectations, but this was the opposite. The book has swearing and her mom sleeps with her teacher! The movie was a G-rated, uplifting, complete family film. I couldn't even finish the book I was so dissapointed. Maybe if I hadn't loved the movie so much and been expecting so much, it would have been okay, but come on, why all the talk about sex? Is that something that we really want our pre-teens and teens to read about?"
4,Princess Diaries blows me away!,It was kind of hard to get into but once you get into it its a rollercoster ride of a teenage girl that goes through so much that normal teenagers will never go through. Mia goes through boy troubles and trouble with friends but she still pulls through and continus her life. I currently finished this book ad I'm reading Volume 2. It looks interesting!!
5,YUM YUM YUM!,"This book is like good chocolate cake: once you start, you want to devour it, and when you are done you wish you had more. I mean, a *really* good cake--the kind with chocolate chips and excellent frosting and ice cream on the side. Everything about the _Princess Diaries_ is charming, from the deftly drawn characters to the clever and compelling plot. I gobbled it up in one sitting, and now cannot wait for seconds. Buy and enjoy this book today!"
5,A must read for teens and parents,"As the mother of two girls, 13 and 10 years of age, I am thrilled by the prospect of both of them reading this book and passing it on to their children. It is rare that a book is written that is entertaining, sensitive, funny and appropriate for both teens and parents.Cabot's book has reminded me of the trials and tribulations that teens go through and will provide my daughters with a rare insight into their days to come. I laughed out loud and will laugh again as my daughters do the same."
2,"Funny, but incredibly superficial...","To begin, I thought this book was hilarious. It was very entertaining, but that is as far as it goes. Maybe I am just sensitive, but there was so much harsh teen-cliquing it was unrealistic. For instance, later in the book, the 'goths' are protesting their right to worship Satan. Uh-hum? And how many goths do you know, Mrs. Cabot? The character of Mia was overly cliqued. She was everything unrealistic and controversial - hardheaded, self-centered, and overall annoying.And that is my review.Ta'ta!"
3,"Cute, short and sweet.","The Princess Diaries is the story of young Mia Thermopolis, whose life is turned upside down when she learns that she is heir to the throne of Genovia, a small European principality. The book is great for teens, and fun for adults, too. The book deals with lots of issues that teenagers face, and puts them into perspective with a morally strong character. Mia Thermopolis is a wonderful girl, and her ideals are strong in the book. With strength of character, Mia deals with the situation graciously, and much more eloquently than it is dealt with in the film.The film undermines some of the most interesting issues addressed in the novel, but it is cute, too, nonetheless.If you are looking for a light summer read, The Princess Diaries is just that. And, it has a little bit of substance too, that might even get the adults thinking.Purchase this one as it is a Mass Market Paperback, and worth the [money]. Enjoy!"
2,Didn't Care For,"I read this book after seeing the movie it inspired, and thought I'd really like it, since I loved the movie, and the ""book is always better."" This may be the one exception to that rule. I found the book to be tedious. The queen is cold and unlovable, and I didn't care for most of the other characters that much either, but she was especially horrible. Skip if you're a fan of the movie."
3,Strikingly Familiar,"The Princess Diaries, though vastly more successful, reminds me a lot of Ellen Conford's A Royal Pain: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0590438212/qid=1121896194/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-7127910-9293666"
3,Not an easy read for a special needs girl.,We will be passing this on to our other granddaughter. This book in the series did not generate as much enthusiasm while reading.
5,Princess Diares,"Mia's life was normal. She was an a average girl, 5 feet 9 inches in height and still waiting for appropriate body parts to arrive. But that all changed when her Grandmother came to town. Her Grandmother comes with the startling news that Mia is princess of Genovia.Will Mia like the news? If she accepts the role of princess, she'll have to change her life. Between princess lessons and dealing with the press, her life will never be the same.Also Mia deals with the normal life and society of a teenager with her best friend Lilly, Lilly's brother Michael and the guy she's had her eye on for a while. Will being a princess change Mia's life for the better or for the worse?"
4,"Finally, a book for teens that teens will actually read","This was a good book. For one thing, it was relatic. Mia life isn't perfect, and while she tries to be socially conusis, she sometimes fails. so what? shes a teen, she's human, not perfect.as for the story? if you enjoyed the watered down, kid 'friendly' movie, you might like this. if you hated the message the movie sent you, then you'll defintly love this book. check out the sequals as well, they're just as good"
5,Something everyone can relate to,This book sweaps all people away into a fanstay world where even though the main character is far from perfect you begin to love her imperfections and you dont feel bad about your imperfectness. This book makes your believe anything is possible!
5,A great book!!,"Although this book is for older children, more like teenagers, this is a great book to read. It deals with issues like cancer, an how it's hard to adjust to new things, but Meg Cabot does it in a funny way!! If you have younger children, let them watch the movie and not let them read the book."
3,typical,"This book, though it is funny and truly sounds like a teenage girl is, I thought, shallow and, well, typical. It doesn't show any depth of character, nor does it display a substantially developed plot toward the end. It's a good book to read when you're bored, but otherwise, . . ."
4,Oh My God!!!!,This was the best piece of writing directed at teens written in the 21st century. Perfect for every one out there even adults.
5,Super dupe of a book!,"I really love this whole series. I've read pretty much all of them. It's about Mia Thermopolis, who thinks she's just an average girl until she finds out she's a Princess. It's not called ""Diaries"" for nothing...cause it's written like one. It is really funny. The movie's really good, too. Try it, speshly if you liked the flick!"
3,It was OK,"I liked this book, I brought it because I love the movie but they are not the same. I didn't realize that it is more like a diary (duh!) but it was ok, I like a lot of dialouge in my books but this was decent."
4,Its a good start,"To a fair series. I never quite got into it as much as Meg's other books book I still enjoyed it. This is the only one I've read seeing as my library at school and my public one don't have the second edition and I'd prefer not to buy it so... But I did like it, I just thought it lacked spunk.For an easy book with boy drama and best friend fights, this here is for you!"
2,The Princess Diaries- Princess in the Spotlight,"I purchased this book for my 11 year old because she had enjoyed the first book. I started to read it myself and was disappointed with the subject matter involving Mia's mother and her algebra teacher sleeping together, Mia's mother becoming pregnant, and Mia pondering whether her mother would consider getting an abortion! Needless to say, I did not give the book to my 11 year old after all, and told her she would have to be much older to read it! I feel the content is for older teens only."
4,The Princess Diaries,"The Princess Diaries is a fantastic book to read. This book is about a high school girl named Mia Thermopolis.Mias real name is Amelia, but at school she goes by Mia.Amelia Thermopolis lives in New York City. She is an ordinary vegetarian with a crush. Mia Thermopolis is really not the prettiest girl you will see until she gets a makeover.One day Amelia not so confident goes to a ritzy hotel to see her Grandmere, which is what we call our grandma. Her Grandmere tells her she is the princess of Genovia.The next week her Grandmere gives her a makeover. Mia gets some good and bad vibes from her classmates. Mia finds out what she really wants to do.This is a fictional book and very fun to read. This book is very much like the movie, but it has a couple extra details. This book is part of the Princess Diaries series. I would recommend this book to girls in fifth through eight grades.-Rachel Emmitt"
2,Poorly Pessimistic,"This book was wonderful. It had a great story line and series of events. However, Mia's character was incredibly pessimistic. She had such a narrow veiw of the world! You would think that someone that concerned about the less fortunate would appreciate the things that she has more because many do not.I found her unbelievably self-centered and selfish, no matter how ""enviromentally friendly"" she was. The thing is, she never looked on the bright side of things. Okay, so her hair looked like a triangle. Oh well! Very Vain. Also, WHY does being 5'10"" make her a freak??? and what is wrong with big feet? Alot of people have large feet nowadays, and what is wrong with being tall? Many glamorous people are. Models are. That was the main stickler about this book. If Mia was just a tad more positive, this book would be good."
2,So much more then expected,"As a picky reader, I was quite hesitant to read this book. My first thought was ""isn't this for little kids?""That's also what I said about Harry Potter, which is my favortie book. Ever.But I dismissed the thought and bought the book, read it, and laughed so hard! I could relate to many of the circumstances, well, not about being a *princess*, but this is a book for all teenage girls. It's funny, sad, and perfect for any girl who hates reading. This is a sure way to get your daughter, best friend, or sister to read.Recently, my uncle passed away, and when my feelings became sad and angry, I read this book. And I laughed. And laughed. And laughed.My sister kept asking me to leave the room, I was laughing so hard with this book. It kept me up to all hours, and I'm very eager to read the second book.I beg of you, do *not* pass this book up! It's great, and I'm sure you will love it!"
1,HORRIBLE,This book is 100% pure trash! It is very inappropriate for anyone. Even though the movie is good the book is one of the trashiest books I have ever read. It is constantly making fun of Jesus Christ/God and using his name in vain. It is also very immoral and set bad examples! I would not suggest to anyone and it desevres 0 stars.
4,"a cute, light read","I read this as a favor to my mother, who's a children's librarian, and was pleasantly suprised. Both of us have read the author's other books, and were not impressed, but this one was fairly well-written and original, if somewhat implausible. I'd recommend it for middle-school girls, and perhaps ninth graders as well."
5,This book RULEZ!,This is like the best book ever. It's not cheesy and it's soooo funny. It's like real life happenings too. Just read the book if you haven't. The only thing is that a guy would hate it. So guys: don't read it!
4,Love it on Audio too!,"Mia Thermopolis is a normal teenaged girl just trying to get through normal everyday life, and is thrust into the spotlight when it's discovered she's the only heir to the throne of Genovia.She finds herself taking princess lessons from an overbearing grandmother. Wonderfully read by the actress from Disney's recently released movie. The plot in the movie is the same although some of the story is different, i.e. location and father existence.Read or listen, it's a great story."
4,Quirky fun,"Teens will enjoy this story about high school freshman Mia Thermopolos, who learns that her father is the prince of the small country of Genovia, and that she is the only heir to the throne. Her horror at learning this is magnified when she discovers that her dowager grandmother will be giving her lessons in how to behave royally.While the teen slangy-ness and light tone may be off-putting to some adults and mature teens, the plot moves along quickly, and the diary format will keep readers hooked. Subplots are minimal and the boy-girl situations are easy to predict, but Mia's sense of humor and quirky determination to keep her royal status hidden will endear her to most young adult readers."
5,"Funny, educational, totally entertaining","I predict that this book will be the big surprise bestseller of the year 2000. I have been privileged enough to read advance copies, and I was absolutely entranced. The characters are vivid (just wait till you meet Grandmere), the situation is intriguing, and the denouement is completely satisfying. This is the definitive young teen book of the new century.Its appeal -- while absolutely modern -- crosses generations. Without a word of a lie, I gave my advance copy to my mother -- 89 years young -- and she could not put it down. She was laughing, she was crying, and she thought it was the best book she had read in years.She -- like the rest of my family -- cannot wait for the movie!"
4,An Enchanting Modern Fairy Tale,"This is the most creative book I have ever read. I really enjoyed this book because it actually does sound like what teens today would write. The language of the book is very modern and the actions are very realistic. This story isn't the classic ""Dear Diary"" thing with calmness, but it is an explosion of emotions written down. It is something more likely to be found in my diary. This creativity is simple, yet it makes the story much more fun.I also loved the plot of the story and the characters. The plot is very original. It is about a girl, Mia, who finds out that she is the next heir to the throne of a microscopic country, when she is already fourteen! Imagine not knowing that for all your life. The characters are very fun because none of them are that normal. Mia is an invisible girl who needs more self-esteem, and she has a best friend who is rebellious and independent, Lily.The book is somewhat different from the movie, but I think it is more enjoyable."
4,a reader from Italy Taylor Cade,"At the begining of this book you think that it is going to be really boring and like the movie, but it is not like the movie it is actually quite different and it isn't boring at all. It took me two days to finish this book, I couldn't keep my nose out of it!"
3,If you acctually like Jahn then you might like this book...,"It's a great overview of projects Jahn designed in the 80's. Unfortunatly most of the projects look dated but the book does shed new light on the processes envolved with designing them. It does contain O'hare, 425 Lexington ave, Northwesten Atrium Center, His infamous Messetrurm and 120 North Lasalle. Unfortunatly it doesnt include commentary on the state of Illinois center or the xerox bldg."
4,birthday gift,We got this to give as a brithday gift and my daughters loved it too. In fact everyone at the birthday party liked it. The tiny accessories could be a choking hazard for younger siblings though.
3,Kind of confused!,"It's kind of a confuse book, lot's of newspaper news.. from the 60's and some texts and stories... but not well organized."
4,SMACZNY!,"Co slychac? I may have lost just about all my Polish, but this album still ranks. I picked this one up by accident when a friend snagged it in Warsaw a few years back (I'll complete my HEY and KULT back-catalogues some other time). It is a capital r Romantic album that grows on you, with nice orchestration of pieces that I will place in a bardic tradition....imagine Vytautas Kernagis with the LRTV Orchestra, if you can....I wish I could tell you more about Pan Tadeusz, but this disc speaks for itself...even if you can't continue a conversation beyone ""Czeszcz"" anymore."
1,Watch out about any sissy bar with clamps...,"I ordered this to hold up my banana seat on a retro-look motorized bike I'm building.Due to not being able to adequately being able to tighten the clamps to the bar no matter how tight I could get the clamps...had nothing but issues with not being able to ride my bike. As long as this type of sissy bar is not being used to support any type of weight and for decoration only...you will have no problems. Because of this...ended up finding a less expensive 42 inch sissy made to fit a beach cruiser frame and bolt to the axle of the rear wheel. This ended the issue of the ""adjustable"" seat while being used. Plus...was able to bend that new sissy bar to an almost 45 degree angle for an even more funky look.In addition...you are on your own to locate the bolts and nuts to hook the clamps to the bike. Would have been nice to have included 50 cent bolts and nuts to install to your bike."
1,Beauty is as beauty does,"Any beauty in this novel is only skin deep. It is disturbing, distorted, and decidedly disingenuous. Unhappy people make silly and/or stupid choices throughout. These things don't amount to an engaging story, they add up to an avatar protagonist with an agenda.Put bluntly, the book stinks."
1,As dull as watching paint dry,"I read this academic mumbo-jumbo passing as Literature, and thought it was awful. Leaves a bad taste in your mouth. ""Epigone"" comes to mind as a way to compare this work to the works of other contemporary Asian authors."
1,Blah Blah Blah....,"Invisible Gardens made me feel like an ADD sufferer. I found myself thinking about grocery lists and meeting schedules rather than focusing on the story. I was so bored with this woman's daily life, I was forced to think about my own. This is not to say that every book should be filled with excitement, but I do expect to be entertained in some way shape or form.The story itself makes no sense. Lily is so bored with her own life, she rebels by having an affair. There is no rhyme or reason to the plot, characters or ending. It's like listening to a boring friend telling a boring story filled with nonsense. Who cares?"
5,The only guide for making curtains!,"I would recommend this book to anyone. It guides the reader in making all types of curtains-from sheers to swags to bed linen. It is easy to follow and although no patterns are included, one can easily follow the steps for making the pattern!"
3,Deceptive.....,"At first glance this book seemed excellent but after reading it it transpired that the instructions are not always very clear. Although an experienced curtain and blind maker at times I could only decipher instructions in the light of existing knowledge. A beginner would sometimes have difficulty in working out what to do. Text and diagrams were often not clearly connected or illustrated. Also, alternative methods of procedures were not highlighted. For example, different ways of dealing with the construction of a roman blind."
1,Dont buy this!,My Aunt owns this thing. I used it to vacuum her car. Well! I was so dissapointed! This has no suction power what so ever! It wouldnt even suck up a piece of fuzz! What a joke.I would rather pick up the dirt with my hands then struggle with this thing! Dont buy this!
1,Awkward and not-so-good,"I purchased this thinking it would be a wonder and I was right... wonder what I was thinking! Its suction isn't powerful when you use the hose. Try to vacuum up spilled kitty litter? It sucks it up but not in, and as soon as you turn it off, a bunch of kitty litter spills back out. The fact that the cord isn't retractable and doesn't have a spool to wind it on makes the Shark unwieldy - you have a ton of cord to try and deal with. Not to mention that it's pretty heavy and using the shoulder strap to carry it like a purse is also awkward. It doesn't hold much dirt - you have to empty it quite often to regain any suction. I am extemely disappointed with this product."
4,Great vacuum with shop vac like power,"I bought this locally on sale and I must say i was impressed. Right when I opened the box and turned it on the sound coming out of the motor shows you how powerful it is.I bought it to keep in my car and clean it without hauling out a shop-vac and be held down by cords or the shop-vac hitting the side of the car.It cleans car carpets and seats with ease. The construction of the unit is quite good, does not feel cheap like other small hand vacuums. The cord has lots of length without needing to pull an extension cord around with you.Although there is some cons like not having a carrying case which makes putting this back into the box after use a little bit of a pain. Also it should have came with a car adapter so you could use it anywhere anytime. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something like a boat, car, truck or motor home."
5,BUY IT!!! WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!!,I just bought my shark and I love it! What suction! I read the reviews of those who say it does not work and I am soooo confused. They must have done something wrong. For the price and quality it is a great purchase. I am buying one for my mother!
2,Perfect until the motor went.....,"This vacuum was a dream until the other day when the motor went. I noticed the problem when I was using the appliance. I started to smell smoke. I thought perhaps the Hepa filter in the back was too full, but it was not. That was when I noticed the sparks flying in the vacuum. Needless to say I have to investigate if I can get a new one from the company. I will say this; I take very good care of my appliances. After every use (usually weekly) I washed the filter and let it properly dry for a day. This product failed because it was poorly designed. If they don't make good on this problem, I am reporting them to the proper agencies. This is a safety concern, especially when I have owned it for less than one year. I would advise not getting this product."
2,Not as much power/suction as I expected,From the commercials and ads on this product I really expected a lot of power and suction. I was very disappointed. It does not have half the power of my small Dirt Devil hand vac. I had given that one to my son to take to college and thought to get a new one for me. So I bought the new powerful Shark. What a let-down!
1,Not what I needed-maintenance too high,"The portability is great. Unfortunately, half-way up the stairs I have to empty the cup/clean the filter. Emptying the cup/filter causes a big mess. The unit just does not hold enough waste to be and effective vacuum."
2,decent but not up to expectations,"Compared to other handheld cordless vacs, it is very good.However, the Shark's claim of being powerful and quiet is highly exaggerated. The vac worked fine for the first few months, but the motor seemed to lose a little power and after a year of use the suction power was mediocre at best. You will need to empty the bag constantly and keep it fully charged for it to perform well.Also the round shape of the vac is a major design flaw, the ""snout"" of the vac is so broad and blunt with the opening of the vacuum so small it was hard to get into corners unless you use an attachment.The charger is also another design flaw, it is often hard to dock the vacuum in it and doesn't fit so well.It is also noisy, it's not terribly loud, but it produces an annoying whiney higher pitched sound.Generally, cordless vacs are not the greatest in terms of performance and longevity, but if you must get one and don't have much to spend than I could recommend this vac half heartedly."
5,lithophane night light,I bought one of these night lights for my mother and it is so pretty. The picture really does it no justice. Haven't seen the color one in person yet.
3,Very pretty,"Very pretty. Choose a place where it can be viewed from straight on as the plate sits away from the light. It is quite bright, but viewed from at least 15 feet away is just what it is advertised to be. It too bright to put in a bedroom and not right for a hall."
5,Auto safety gear,I bought 4 of these for our cars as we are in the Colorado mountains during some challenging weather.I have not used them as we keep them available for emergencies.Colorful material should help in a rescue situation.Insulation ability should help with survival when needed.
4,Good product,"This blanket is good. I haven't gotten to use it much yet, but it does appear to be everything advertised. It is a plastic layer on the inside and outside, with an aluminum and one other layer in between. This multiple layer design also allows the product to be rain / windproof. Most of these ""blankets"" are designed the same way, but if you buy the thin aluminum ones, these are noticeably different. These seem much sturdier than those thin ones. These have the grommets at each corner which help if you want to use it as a lean to, or wind break.These can also be used for a ""table"" on the ground, a fish cleaning station, etc. The possibilities are pretty much limited only by your imagination."
5,great lightweight tarp,Love this blanket! It's a great light-weight tarp and folds up to about the size of a paperback book. I bought the orange one for our emergency kit and have pulled it out and used it at several outdoor concerts now. My only concern is it's durability. after just the first time using it I noticed a very small hole at one of the folds.
3,Tested on 18 degree nights in an unheated camper,"My husband works on the pipeline in Ohio. He used to be in the Marine Corps for 13 years and spent many nights in the cold during training, so he familiar with similar products. I purchased this blanket because he stays on the yard in an unheated camper most nights. He uses this blanket with his sleeping bag and he said ""wow, what a difference"" he is very comfortable now even on the coldest of nights.There is a con - it is stiffer than it looks in the picture, very similar to the typical rescue blankets that you see out there. It is silver on the inside not fuzzy green as it is portrayed in the picture. That is very misleading. However, we have tried both and this one comes out on top."
2,did not look like this picture,the picture they had with this looked like it had a soft lining andnot a foil look at all. And now I cant find this kind on amazon.
3,Long Time Gone,"Interesting, but long and depressing.As a sailor I liked the sailing parts best, but for the drugs what an ugly way to live. But then he sure had the women."
3,A Rose Colored Autobiography,"This is an entertaining read of a flawed personality. I recommend you take David Crosby's contributions with a grain of salt. He is very careful to accept no responsibility for the lives he helped ruin, he shows no remorse and often tries to paint himself as a victim. On more than one occassion he tries to paint his actions as being noble. If you can stomach all that, you will enjoy it. It is very hard to read this book and have any respect left for the man. If that is a problem, it is best to read something else."
4,Great Book,"I really enjoyed Long Time Gone. Great autobiography, if you are a fan and lived in the era you must read it."
3,On Par With The Original,"My opinion of Puppet Master II is about the same as my opinion of the first Puppet Master. It's great when the puppets are on screen, killing and looking creepy. However, when the puppets aren't around, the movie isn't that great. It takes itself too seriously. I actually favor Demonic Toys over the Puppet Master series. That one at least had a nice sense of humor...and Tracy Scoggins."
3,Gloriously stupid!,"The Puppet Master films are some of the best low budget crap you can get, and I say that with love. These movies are pure, brainless fun. My only real complaint is that they can't seem to decide if Toulon is a bad guy or a good guy, but then again, low budget crap. :P"
3,Basic Home for a SMALL animal,"This cage is very basic, good for a first time owner of a SMALL animal - hamster, gerbil, mice, etc. I would NOT use this for a guinea pig, chinchilla, hedgehog, or ferret - it is wayy too tiny. It is light, easy to move, easy to clean, and not too much of an eyesore. The only reason why I feel it isn't worth 4 or 5 stars is because of its size. I would give the My First Home cages 5 stars but I would highly recommend the Large or Extra Large sizes."
5,Very Happy,I received the pet cage on time and in great condition it was delivered to my house sooner then expected and was easy to put together was done in 5 min and there was no problems! I highly recommend ordering a pet cage from this company not only was it smooth process but it was an excellent price!
4,"Good popcorn, but...","I bought this popcorn popper for my husband and he loves it. Our 8-year old daughter helps him make it every Sunday, which is pretty cool. It makes great popcorn, if you like it fluffy, which he does - and it's quick. The popper is easy to clean, but not so easy to store. Also, the lid broke when my husband was washing it, BEFORE he had even used it. He was still able to make popcorn, and the company was quick about sending a label to return it at no cost to us, but it's a hassle to box it up and get it sent out. I'm afraid the new lid will do the same thing as it is rather flimsy. The popper has a 25 year warranty, but like I said, for me it's a hassle to send things back, and I don't like hassles."
3,best tasting popcorn,"I love movie theater pocorn, and this is very close! 100% better than microwave popcorn. But the appearance of this popper is deceiving. The wood handle is sturdy and thick. The cranking mechanisms seem to be well made. But the pot is a thin aluminum, and the L-screws that connect the lid to the sides so that you can lift up each side of the lid, are poorly designed. I have had to replace the L screws when they fell out at least once, and there are four of them. I even attempted to glue them in place, but that did not work for long. It is a nuisance to clean, and getting the right amount of oil and butter in the dish is a trial and error process. As disappointed as I am in the shoddy workmanship, I still use it, as I love the taste of the popcorn it makes."
2,Great Popcorn but.....,I've owned this popper for almost a year now. When I first received it as a gift I was really excited. It makes great popcorn BUT it is a pain in the neck to clean! As someone else stated in their review the L-screws that connect the lid fall out when you take the lid off. Cleaning the popper is a chore because of the was the lid is designed. It only took four or five times of using it before I got tired of cleaning it. I can't think of the last time I've used it because of the chore of cleaning up...I'm back to the microwave.
1,"Good popcorn, bad design","As others have said there are many problems with the design of this popper. The popcorn is good, but that does not reflect the different poppers because they will all taste the same. This popper has a viewing window (plastic) on the top. This window is what I saw as its biggest fault. Since I like popping popcorn several times a week my poppers get use a great deal. The window cracked after using it for 3 days. For the next month it continued to crack more and more until the window just dropped out of it. With that window gone, there is no way to &quot;safely&quot; pop popcorn because it will shoot out and the oil splashing. The little butter holder is pointless and useless. My advice is find a popper that does not have a viewing window."
3,It's Alright,"First I want to say that this popper makes excellent tasting popcorn. I had no problem with grease splatters or a loose fitting lid. Which leads me to my explanation of giving this popper 3 stars. I have owned this popper for less than a year. Before I even used the popper, I took it apart to see how easily it fit back together. It didn't easily fit back together. I had to have my husband manipulate it back together. I thought what the hey and used it anyway. As I mentioned the popcorn is 5 star quality. But then after about 3 months use (once a week), the aluminum clasp that holds the lid on snapped off. The popper is still usable without the clip, I just have to hold that side of the lid, while pouring the popcorn into the bowl. If I don't hold the lid, popcorn is everywhere. I shouldn't have to make due with a 3 month old product. Regardless the thing still works even though that part broke and I can not take it apart and reassemble."
2,Cheaply Made,"I'll be honest, I love popcorn. After I decided the real popcorn machines were too expensive, and too much of a hassle to keep clean I thought the Back to Basics Stove-Top Popcorn Popper would be the perfect alternative. Unfortunately it broke the second time I used it."
1,good pop corn but lid broke,"The pop corn is very good, but the lid broke. I am going to look for one that has a solid metal top. But the pop corn is great, and you can put sugar in there with the oil and salt to form glaze, and cinamon, pepper, chinese five spice, and so on"
2,Butter drip cup,The butter drip cup handle/hook broke on the second use. I am having trouble getting to the manufactures site. The rest of the popper is wonderful - a little too easy to burn the popcorn though.
3,Good results - Poor Construction,"The popcorn that this popper makes tastes great: much better than from a microwave. But the popper itself is poorly designed. The lid is hard to get off for cleaning, and the doors are getting very loose. I have never had trouble with popcorn burning or sticking."
2,great popcorn,"I agree with other reviewers. Very poor construction. The plastic lid broke within 2 uses, and the screws began loosening everywhere at once and it literally fell apart before my eyes. The popcorn was great while it lasted."
1,fundmentalist godfather,"Sayid qutb was an influential member of the muslim brotherhood who's writings still to this day misguide many.Sayed qutb strips the verses from many of its colours so he can twist its neck around & mould it into whatever suits his groups aim. By what is called the expression generalization you can almost contort any verse to suit any purpose or goal. Sayed qutbs tafseer or writing isnt only antiquated or obsolete,it only values with fanatics. Its a real pity that such a name is read by many yet other moderate religious thinkers such as sheikh Mohamed Abdou are forgotton.to those who think much of sayed qutb, i advise them to read what a past compatriot of the muslim brotherhood had to say about qutbs writings, the sheikhs name is Khalil Abdel Karim."
5,Best sounding EMI comp,Despite the fact that this compilation was released in 1987 (or perhaps because of it) this is still by far the best sounding compilation of The Animals EMI/Mickie Most sides. No noticeable noise reduction or compression and more or less straight transfers for the masters - another Steve Hoffman forum favourite.
5,Had this book as a child,I had this book as a child and I loved it. It was worth the money to buy it for my son. Great moral lessons.
2,I couldn't finish it!,"I really loved the Amber series, also by Zelazny, so I purchased this book. Now, it is very rare that I do not finish a book, even if I dislike it. However, this was one that I could just not bring myself to finish. Even halfway through, I was unsure of precisely what the plot was. It was extremely strange and I found it hard to follow. I do not suggest this book, especially to fans of the Amber series. It was nothing like what I expected."
3,Not his best,"While this book is certainly not a bad read, it did disapoint me a bit. I expected really good things from this book since I greatly enjoyed ""Donnerjack"", (another of the Zelazy, Lindskold ""collaborations""), but it didn't deliver. Some of that Zelazy charm was there, but the characters just didn't jump of the pages like they do in ""Donnerjack"" or in other Zelazy's works. I guess everything can't be as good as the Amber books or ""Lord of Light."" So I guess I'd say, not bad, but not fantastic."
3,Wish they had 3.5 stars...,"I would give this 3.5 stars, but this option is not available and I just can't give it 4, so...This book feels like an adaptation of a role-playing game session or something. It just doesn't translate. The idea is good, and the book holds promise for the first 1/3 to 1/2, but doesn't deliver.As previously noted, the ending is too pat. The intrigue unfolds too rapidly, and is much more simplistic than I expect from Roger. And, I just couldn't stomach the cheesy way he resolved the final battle. I could have come up with that one myself - and I would have rejected it out of hand.I wonder how much of this is due to Lindskold patching things together?"

5,Lord Demon - a great farewell,"To know Roger Zelazny is to love him.Here is his final story. The story of a quiet artist trying to find beauty in a modern world.Beauty in his works of glass art, beauty in his limited friends and hidden supernatural worlds. But danger arrives quickly and friends die.His anger wakened, the protagonist sets out on a mystery to find who his hidden enemies are and why they have drawn him out of his peaceful life. The adventure is intriguing, the characters are well drawn.Betrayal is a promise around almost every corner.Zelazny's touch is evident in every page. Comparisons to other works are unavoidable (look at the other reviews for this.) This story shines.And when it ends, you do not want to walk away from the characters. You want more. Fitting final tribute to an author who wrote characters designed to explore the universe and intrigue your heart.Thanks to Jane Lindskold, a brave lady, a fine writer. You may wish to look into Lindskold's 'Athanor' books here on Amazon."
1,Roger did not write this book....,While Roger Zelazny may have sketched the outline for this novel - he certainly did not write it! Roger never liked the use of vulgarity but Jane Lindskold seems to feel the need to use vulgarity to infuse masculinity into the work---Unfortunately Rogers major strong point was his poetic writing ability and style - it just isnt here and should not be confused with works that truly bear his name...
2,Three Strikes and you're out,"I am an avid reader of mystery novels, I love them so I know a good read, when I read it, I am a die-hard fan of Judith Smith-Levin, now that's a mystery writer, and many other African-American mystery writers as well, so after I read all three of your books Ms. Thomas-Graham, in my opinion, I did not find your books an enjoyable read, I lost interest quickly. I became bored with the mystery solving as well as the romance part of the book."
4,Good Read,"Ms. Thomas-Graham has created an entertaining story line, that will have you guessing who did it. This book actually is more ""readable"" than the first two, although the first two were good, she used a lot of large terms that one may not understand. This book however is an enjoyable read, and I'm looking forward to the next one."
3,"*sighs*.....same plot, same theme",This sure happens a lot. Ashleigh or another character gets attatched to a horse and when it dies they close themselves off from horses until another horse magically makes them feel better. These books are great--I ALREADY HAVE FOURTEEN FROM THE SERIES--but there should be a little more variety.
4,"DVD release, PLEASE!!!","I first saw this movie when I was 11 years old. If my mom had known the subject matter, I would have definitely been prohibited from seeing it. However, what my mother would not have realized is that, if anything, this movie actually discouraged me from under-age sex. I'd really love to watch this movie with my 14-year-old daughter so maybe she can get the message I got from it... that sex IS a big deal and NOT something to do out of peer pressure. My biggest drawback of this film is that I always found Tatum O'Neil utterly annoying, but Kristy & Matt make it worth it! Of all the movies I saw as a child, Little Darlings, Parent Trap & Star Wars are the only ones that really stayed with me as very memorable."
4,What happened to the ending song?,"I recently bought this at Media Play, ( a video store here in Pittsbugh) and was disappointed that ""Let Your Love Flow"" by the Belemy Brothers ( i think) was omitted.. Why is this?? I always remembered this as the ending song, why did they take it out? I saw on the box that some music had been changed, but why?? Anyone know? BUT, I still love this movie!!!!"
5,Desperately seeking Tatum!,"Ok, so I'm a good 30 years late, but totally crushing on Tatum O'Neal, so much so that I sought out her movies. Watched this on Youtube.. great little film! Agree that it's underrated, especially Tatum. Tatum Tatum Tatum... we need more Tatum! Pleeeeaaaase release this on DVD or Blu-Ray Paramount!"
4,Enjoyable movie,"Little Darlings is movie about two very different teenage girls(Tatum O'Neal as rich girl Ferris,Kristy McNichol as tough girl Angel) at summer camp who enter into a contest to see who loses her virginity first.That may not sound very exciting,but the young cast really makes this film enjoyable.Tatum O'Neal does decent job,but it's Kristy McNichol who really shines in her role.The rest of the cast includes (a very young)Cynthia Nixon,Matt Dillon,and Armand Assante.I have one beef with this video edition.I saw the movie on cable and the Bellamy Brothers' ""Let Your Love Flow"" played over the closing credits.It was replaced on this video with some generic late 70s/early 80s pop song."
3,American Pie for the girls?,"This movie is about two girls who compete to lose their virginity. At several points in the movie I so embaressed for the characters I had to mute it so I wouldn't have to hear the dumb things they said.It reminded me of American pie because in american boys compete to lose their their virginity and the only one that does lies about it to protect the girl he slept with. Of course it isn't funny like some people thought that damn pie movie was.Personally I will never watch this movie again, but it was fun for one night."
1,FAKE! THIS FILM NOT RELEASED ON DVD.,BUYERS BEWARE! This listing is for a bootleg copy--of a film that has never been released on DVD.
2,"Movie is still great, changing the music isn't!","Wow, it's been years since I've seen this movie and it's still funny and very touching, but why on earth did they change the music? I hate that they took the Bellamy Brothers song from the end credits and even worse? They took out John Lennon's ""Oh My Love"" song which was a haunting part of the movie during that scene in the boathouse. They ruined the re-issue. ARGGH!! That stuff is all part of the nostalgic charm of that movie, in my opinion. When it comes out on DVD, I sure hope they restore it back to the original way it was. I don't like this VHS version at all because of the changes, so I'll be reselling it eventually."
4,Oldie and Goodie!,"This movie brings back my childhood. I think it is hilarious and lots of fun. It is also a good lesson on ""don't judge a book by it's cover"". I agree that it needs to be on DVD ASAP. Let's hope they add the alternate scenes I've seen on TV as bonus features."
1,bootlegs,"I could already tell it would be a bootleg, and for the price they want, forget it. I bought a bootleg copy of ""Bless the beast and the children"" but it was only $15, i can deal with that till it comes out. But this, no way. i love this film, but can wait till official release."
3,"This movie is cute and entertaining, but extremely 80s corny","Two fifteen-year-old summer campers become rivals at first sight. Angel is a poor, streetwise girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Ferris is wealthy and naively stuck-up. The two 15-year-old girls are competing against each other in a contest to see who can lose her virginity first. It's a rich-girl, poor-girl bonding movie with hormones flying everywhere. Not an Oscar ""should've-been"", but cute and worth renting for an evening of fun and 80s flashbacks."
4,Finally somewhere I can watch this movie!,"I looked just about everywhere for this video and no place has it! (Don't buy/rent dvd's of this movie from anyone...they have not released a DVD of the movie!)So I was really, really happy to find it here. Its a really great summer teen movie and I highly recommend it!"
4,"A Great ""Coming of Age"" Movie.","My mother took me to see this movie the summer I turned 10 (after seeing it once to ensure it was appropriate). It helped me to understand, in a non-confrontmental way, some of the issues that I was heading into in my own life. It opened up a dialogue of discussion between my mother and myself about several topics involved in the movie from peer pressure to self-asteem to the ownership of one's body. If and when I have a daughter, I will share this movie with her and hopefully she will respond in a similar manner as I did.While it is not a masterpiece, it is a sweet movie about two girls, competitiveness, friendship and the feelings of insecurity we all (at least us girls) had as teens."
5,Pure flowing electronic/downtempo,"Thank you LTJ. This is a reminder why you top the genre. Downtempo lounge mixed with electronic and instrumental jazz riffs. Some real solid perfomances on this album and all in all a fantasic effort. Blame, Artemis, DJ Addiction.. very fine talent represented here."
1,Made in China,"I actually researched this company and according to their website, this product was supposedly made in the USA. I ordered it. It arrived today. It's made in China. I'm returning it tomorrow."
2,"Looks good, but what the heck happened to mine?","I purchased this from Amazon. It looks great except for a few tiny little problems. Namely, the product packaging looks as if this thing was either punted or hit with a baseball bat.Maybe it is just the shock that the first item I bought something off of Amazon.com for a Christmasgift arrives ten days beforehand clearly damaged. But, but I am torn about what to write here. Consider the damage the box took I am amazed that the damage isn't worse than it is."
5,Frank Sinatra sings the Select Cole Porter,This CD was in good condition as it was a used CD. No problems I had encountered with the seller.
3,lucky buddy,"I was really looking for a buddy, but I didn't realize there were babies, buddies and mini's. This seller was very nice and offered to take it back b/c I wanted a buddy,but I like the baby too! Great seller!"
4,Awesome trek down memory lane....,"Even though I was just a child when much of their hits were made, I was still raised on much of the Motown and Stax soulful sounds. Just amazes me to hear David Ruffin's raspy but commanding voice as well as the unmistakable and inimitable, Eddie (Keep On Truckin') Kendricks...as well as the only living Temptations survivor still playing venues, Dennis Edwards. My dad is going to LOVE rolling down the street listening to this and recalling wonderful years and youthful days gone by, of growing up in rural Georgia!"
1,First Of All.........,"These are great songs but..........this compilation was put out purely with corperate ideals in mind and you can pick between it andThe Ultimate Collection,Anthology-The Best of The Temptations,Gold,Psychedelic Soulor the boxed setEmperors of Souland be more satisfied.These songs are victims of pure oldies radio ware and tare."
3,mediocre for Krahn,"While this book would be quite good for some authors, it's definitely mediocre for Krahn. There are excellent moments, but the twists and turns are repetitive and almost comical at inapproproate moments. The villains are inconsistent and most are too easily dealt with. The roadblocks are sometimes contrived and not worthy of the weight given them. Brien's father's character alters according to the role he needs to play in the plot. Krahn's descriptions of Aaron's enthusiasm for the opportunity in America is marvelous, though, as are some of the moments for the romantic leads.It's an okay read, certainly better than many, but it has too many faults to be a must read and it's certainly not a must buy."
2,convoluted claptrap,"Bettina Krahn usually writes a good novel. This was not.The plot was convoluted and silly. Her dominating Daddy wants to marry her off to a man of little honour, who is a one dimensional very nasty fellow.Our intrepid heroine goes off to London and pays the hero 4000 pounds so he'll wed her, a total stranger. He then seduces her, just as her slimy fiance doesa few days earlier. She seems to have trouble saying no to complete strangers. The wedding is a sham, and she docily marries the villain who is a very, very bad fellow indeed. She keeps him from the marriage bed, but he fortuitously expires in suspicious circumstances. Oh yes, she undergoes a complete overhaul of her appearance and gets skinny. Probably from being locked in the dungeon. And then we have the Big Misunderstanding. I didn't finish it. This was apparently one of these rewritten early stories. Why take a potboiler and make it worse? Bettina, you are capable of so much better."
1,Total garbage,"Worst quality endmill Ive ever seen. Probably fine if youre using it to cut styrofoam or something. Used to take some light cuts on aluminum, 3"" DOC, 7500 RPM, .010 stepover, 60IPM, and the thing exploded."
2,Sucias are only so-so,"I liked this book at the beginning. Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez has a wonderful way of describing her characters (and exposing their flaws). Each of the characters is at least marginally likeable in her own right, but because the point of view switches so frequently, I got to the end of the book feeling I didn't know any of them very well.The persecution of Elizabeth for her ""secret"" struck me as unrealistic and not likely. And the characters' revelations about God seem to come from someone who has never cracked the cover of the Bible or stepped through the doors of a chapel. My advice: Enjoy the book for its awesome characterization, but ignore the liberal preaching."
2,well...,"I like a fun guilty pleasure read as much as anyone. As I started this book, I was encouraged by the novelty of a diverse group of Latinas in literature. Unfortunately, my excitement didn't hold. As a previous reviewer mentioned, none of these characters are particularly sympathetic or makes the reader feel an emotional connection.The storytelling often comes off as shrill and needs to be toned down. One gets the impression that this book was thrown together too quickly or without the aid of a skilled editor. What's worse is the author resorts to the typical literary female character flaws that we've all seen before. Aside from the protagonists background, it's similar to the recent glut of ""chick"" books which I have found lacking in plot and character development. In the end, it wasn't a fun read which is a shame because novels with a Latino-American perspective are eagerly awaited."
2,Ugh.,"I am absolutely baffled as to why there is so much praise for this book. First off, the first chapter was absolutely grating. The writing style was horrible and seemed like a high school student wrote it. I appreciate that it showed Latinas of different backgrounds and ethnicities, and it was a light, entertaining read, but it is definitely not quality literature. Also, two details bugged me: At one point in the book, a black British man actually says that in England there is no racism. (??????) Also, Lauren's bulimia is almost passed off as a normal coping strategy, and there is no indication that her behavior is a disease. I felt that was pretty irresponsible of the author.All in all, it's like a soap opera -- mindless entertainment with plenty of eye rolling."
3,O K but not great.,"I think the book was ok, but it wasn't a great read. Like many have said, something you can read on a rainy day, or a on a Sunday with some ice cream. I did notice that there were a few inconsistencies in the book, and all the Latina Spanglish jargon got to me. It was overboard, and unrealistic. My favorite character was Lauren, probably because she was more real, and not so composed. Amber was my second favorite."
2,"If not looking for fluff, you'll be disappointed","I was expecting a Latina Terry McMillan but thought the conversations were not that witty, the ending was predictible, and the writing was just not that clever. I agree with the other comments about the stereotypes; the story contained too many of them and they were exxagerated and inaccurate - a Puerto Rican as wide as a bus?! Even with all the problems, if you don't expect much, you'll be entertained."
3,"Good, but a little disappointing","This book started out strong -- I was immediately drawn in to the author's description of these unique characters (or at least unique to the chick flick genre). She had a real flair for bringing them to life and making them interesting. But, there were several things that kept me from loving the book (I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could -- I didn't love it, but it wasn't bad). One, a few pieces of the ending seemed too overtly set up for a 2d book in the series (I could be wrong about her plan, but I like books to be a little more subtle in this respect -- give the readers a little more credit). Two, Sara's storyline was far too predictable. Three, I never really bought why Lauren was such a boozer, and her new boyfriend was a little too good to be true. Despite these flaws, I enjoyed the story and will still read book number 2 if and when it comes out."
3,Five Friends,"Five Hispanics girls become friendsin college, forming the sucias,the dirty girls. I love all theHispanic culture, the Spanishwords and phrases, so much thatI can overlook the amazing waythat each of the five is froma different Spanish subculture,almost as if they were chosenfor a Census Bureau study, andthe happily-ever-after endingsthat occur for each woman, eventhe gay woman journalist, eventhe battered wife, even thegirl dating the former drug dealer."
2,One of the dumbest books ever,"This book gives latinas a bad name. Basically it's about a group of empty headed, useless, lazy, out of shape, and on the top of that boring girls. They are a disgrace to latina community. The book was the most boring one I've seen in ages. Yuck!"
2,"Big, fat, enh...","This book was just OK. It's not fabulous, and not horrible. The biggest weakness is that there were just too many characters. If Valdes-Rodriguez had four main characters instead of six, the book might have been better. There just wasn't enough character development to really get interested in the lives of the six. Usnavys, I felt, was very undeveloped. They were also stereotyped characters in a way. There's a token lesbian, a token victim of spousal abuse. Sara and Usnavy could easily be left out, spend more time on the other four, and the book would be a lot better.I came away from this book not loving it and not hating it. I didn't feel like the time I spent on this book was wasted, but then again, I didn't have a lot to do on the day I read it.It was nice to see a book set in Boston though."
3,An Captivating Pageturner -,"I finally got this book out of my to-be-read pile and now I'm mad at myself for taking so long to read it! It's a wonderful story of women and friendship. That these women happen to all be Latina is somehow both only a part of the story AND the whole story. Valdes-Rodriguez is truly gifted, giving so many different women such full and complete voices. I gave it three instead of four stars because I felt some of the characters had much weaker voices toward the end."
1,negative,"I expected the book to be funny. Instead, the opening chapter was one long complaint about Latinos being sterotyped, discriminated against, etc. It was ""poor,poor,pitiful me"" paragraph after paragaph. The following chapters were downers. Not until the last chapter did good things seem to happen--not the high=spirtited funny novel I had expected."
5,"Well, I just flat-out loved it","Yeah, it's not deep, it's not great literature, but no one is pretending it is. It's sharp, sassy, irreverent, funny, and just made for women to enjoy like tortilla chips with salsa and a cold Dos Equis straight out of the bottle.This debut novel by a skilled and experienced writer with Attitude with a capital A delivers on its promise. Six friends since college days meet twice a year to catch up on all of each other's dirt, and there's a lot of dirt being dished around.Read it and enjoy it. Don't expect to be educated or transformed; just expect to be wildly entertained."
2,Ok ...a little disappointing,"After much hype from the media I purchased (full price) the novel ""The Dirty Girls Social Club"", I was a little disappointed it wasn't everything I thought it would be, the characters are somewhat unbelievable at times but its kind of cute. I guess I am what the book would call a Latina, my mother is American and my father is Mexican (directly from Mexico), but I couldn't relate to any of the characters at all. I am a professional and around the same age group as the girls portrayed in the book but just some of the things in the book were a little hard to believe. In my opinion wait for the movie because I'm sure there will be one to follow:)"
3,The Stupid Girls Anit-Social Club,"This book was a letdown. I saw it in all different magazines, so I picked up a copy. I though it was going to be funny, but it wasn't. The girls are supposed to be ""sassy"" and ""feisty"" (that's what other reviewers have said), but the girls let people in their lives walk all over them. I only gave it three stars because I'm a nice person."
2,Not Worth It,"I had been on a roll reading like crazy until I got to this book. It definitely slowed me down. I just couldn't get into it. It's about 6 Latina girls that are friends from college that are getting their careers, love lives and thoughts together. None of them were really deep characters that made you want to root for them. The only character that I even came close to wanting to see how she came out was Sara, the domestic violence victim. I thought this was going to be a easy going beach read for the summer but I felt like I was slogging through it. I won't be reading anymore by this author unless she gets a lot better."
2,Dry.....get your saltines out !!!,This book has a very dry start. It does not get good until page 200 or so and 306 is the end of the book. Take your chance if you want to but I would say don't waste your money and get it from the library.
5,A Promising New Voice...,"Valdez-Rodriguez is a promising new writer. As a Hispanic who reads, writes and thinks in English, I appreciate her style, content and ability to break the rules.The Dirty Girls Social Club is a funny novel that touches our realities in a smooth easy to read way. I enjoyed her treatment of each character, her ability to weave social situations, and her humor. Unlike Hispanic literature from native Spanish speakers, or translated works, Valdez-Rodriguez is a writer for us here in the US - ""Latinos"" come in all shapes, colors and from diferent socio/economic backgrounds. Any book that tries to put us in a box is bound to be critized, and this book will certainly have its critics. However, there is no reason why some Latinas should not be snobby, materialistic, and on the prowl for men with money. Welcome to America!Read the book and keep an eye on her (hopefully) future works.Joel"
3,Quite a Fairy tale ending!!,"I picked up this book because im a student at BU and it was really neat to read about the whole Boston scene....anyways...this novel was a quick, ""chick-flick"" read, but at times the story was unbelievable and the end was totally unfeasiable and down right to perfect. It was by no means a bad book....but can not be considred a literary masterpiece"
3,"Sort of good, sort of......not","This book looked like a fun, light read about a small group of friends sorting out their 30s together.And in many ways it was - there was some humor and light moments. The author also explored some more serious issues in a thoughtful way as well.But what I found insulting was the way Valdes-Rodriguez portrayed anyone who didn't share her liberal outlook. She slammed Christians as a group, Dr. James Dobson and Dr. Laura Schlessinger. This added a bitter edge to her tone and I was alienated by her attitude.The characters themselves weren't all that likeable either. Usnavys was a shallow woman that in reality a quality man like Jose wouldn't have found tolerable, the rest of them were very two-dimensional, and the ending was wrapped up far too neatly."
1,blogging isn't a novelistic form....,"This isn't writing, it is thoughtless blogging. But if you like soap operas and reality tv, perhaps you'll enjoy it.There are a few real women writers out there, but AVR is not one of them, not yet. However, identity politics seems to bring in a bigger paycheck than writing....so why shouldn't she cash in on that?"
3,What could have been...,"Even though I found this book entertaining in certain parts, and it was enjoyable to read phrases and quirky sayings familiar to my upbringing, this book did not really live up to all the hype. Yes, it was a fun and fast read, but it lacked conviction in terms of character and story development. The voices of each character blurred with one another, some of the storylines were far-fetched, and the ending was like a nicely wrapped-up bow. I recommend it for a lively summer book, but do not expect it to be a profound and life-altering experience. Just like the cover of the book, it is cute and attractive, but that's all it is."
1,Stereotypes,"The Dirty Girls Social Club is about a group of Latinas who meet in college and who meet a few times a year to dish the dirtt.The characters aren't believable, and everybody is stereotyped, especially the men. They're like something from a bad telenovela. Plus the author doesn't seem to know anything about Latinas outside of her own background, and the errors make you cringe.I don't recommend this book."
5,AWESOME,"This book is what I call easy and FUN!A great group read. The girls are funny, bitchy and vivacious. Latinas will be able to relate to some aspect of this book."
2,Not what I expected!,"I was disappointed by this book. I usually like to read women oriented stories, especially from different cultures and expected the same of this. Unfortunately it didn't keep my engrossed at all. It took me few months to finish it...wasn't interesting enough to compel me to pick it up every night. There are many better ones out there, so don't waste your time and money on this."
4,A fun book to read,"I read another book by the author which inticed me enough to try this one. They are both (the other being ""Riding with Boys"") deal with women in various stages of crisis, and all share common latina heritage. Although I liked ""Riding with Boys"" better, this book is worth a quick read. It's not going to win any prizes for literature but it's a good story with likable characters. It would be interesting for the author to spin both of these books into run-offs using all the characters we meet as their own main character with a central story line. Give it a try - if you like ""chick"" books, you'll enjoy this one."
3,Pleasant Reading,"The Dirty Girls Social Club is what I would call a relaxing book. It takes you away for a little while into the lives of others and also teaches you a little something about different latin cultures. Great book to take with you on a vacation to fill the travel time - short enough to finish & can be read between flights or events. Just enjoy it & don't expect to be blown away, it is just a pleasant book to read."
4,I really liked it!!,"This book was really funny, and it was one of the first books that got me hooked onto reading ""women's novels"". It also made me take an interest in the Spanish language. I thought the characters were really funny, and I ended up finishing the book in only a few days. I had a good time reading it!"
4,Viva Las Sucias!,"This was a great book! It was one of those that you hated to finish, because once you did, there was no more. Until Alisa writes another one, that is.My advice to you? Buy it and read it. It's a keeper."
5,A world apart,"Two hours of wonderful acting and recreation of a world apart. Great to enjoy whilst driving a two hour or three hour journey as the CD is way too short at two hours I was left with a desire for more. Thank you BBC, please reissue more."
3,"Great book, kindle copy full of typos and difficult to read...","I love barbara hambly and this is a great story. Unfortunately, the kindle copy converted every occurance of the word 'me' to the word 'the'. As you can guess, the word 'me' gets used a lot - about 3 times a page. For me I just get up to speed reading when I hit one of these and my brain derails going 'what? what? what does that mean?! ' Trying to decypher the sentence. I finally gave up and went to a printed copy.If anyone knows how to let the author know, please do!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Jumping forward, but crossworld worries persist.Heroine and wizard boyfriend have been living fairly peaceful for a while, so this book doesn't follow on directly from the previous two.However, you know that isn't going to last - as said wizard soon notices strange goings on. Going home to his own world, his bosses are suspicious of him and his story, and hobble him. Just like your typical hidebound Wizard Council, in general.Anyway, problems to be solved, and little magic to do it with, time for the female solution, instead."
3,Not quite as accurate as others,Not as accurate as I would like and tends to zero out by itself. It you're careful not to accidentally touch the reset button it'will be okay. You have to monitor it and make sure it is in exactly the right place for your motion or it will be inaccurate.
3,"Works fine, but durability is a problem","The Sportsline model 340 was my second pedometer this year. I was pleased with the accuracy and ease of use. It was accurate as far as I could tell, as long as it was in a horizontal position on a belt, waistband, or pocket.However, I am replacing the pedometer after approximately only five months of daily use. The hinge for the belt clip is broken and cannot be glued or repaired. I realize this isn't a top-of-the-line model, but it should have lasted longer than five months. My first pedometer, a different Sportsline model, broke in almost the same place after two months. The spring-based belt clip seems to be a weak area in the design."
1,Major quality control problem,"This was completely inaccurate - the first hour I wore it on a long walk, it counted a reasonable number of steps. The following day it registered 200 steps for a 2 hour walk. I'm going to ask for a refund - but I advise readers to get an Omron, I've had good experience with at least one of those (2 years accurate use before it died). I've had 6 different pedometers so far, there is a really widespread quality problem - one of the Omrons was the only reliable one."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I have bought 3 of these and thought the 3rd one would be the charm. I was wrong. The first one, the clip broke off. So, I bought a second one. That one broke too, but the display broke this time. The 3rd one didn't break, it just didn't work accurately. None of them really did. You put it on your belt like it says and it doesn't even count all your steps. Sometimes, it even resets itself and goes back to zero. It is just so frustrating. I am not wasting any more money on these cheap pedometers. I will search for the perfect one. Don't even waste your few bucks on this unless you don't mind it not counting all of your steps."
1,very disappointed,"As I said I am disappointed, it was put together backwards and does not work. I also ordered another one and it did not work either. I really rate it zero but there was not a category for that"
1,Trashed it after a week. No wonder it's discontinued.,"Not worth the shipping cost. Completely flawed. I ordered the Oregon Scientific, which is perfect. Should be ZeroStars.Dr. Parham"
3,Okay for the Money,"This pedometer doesn't always keep an accurate count of steps, but it does an okay job for the money spent."
1,Too Sensitive,Put this in my purse to bring to work with me. Moved purse a few times and started counting steps. Way to sensitive. But I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Sportline 340 Pedometer,I'm not really fond of this piece of equipment. Can't say a whole lot about it as it's always falling coming unclipped. I think it may be a little off on steps as I take about 4 steps and it only measures 3 SO not sure about the accuracy really but hey what do you expect for $15 right? I would recomment for people who don't walk fast and for people that walk on a flat level surface otherwise get something better if you can afford it!
2,reasonably priced - but not very accurate,"I bought this for my daughter. She wanted a pedometer to count her steps every day. This one is a great price and perfect for a child. But, I would not recommend it for a serious athlete/individual looking for an accurate recording of their steps and distance.The pedometer indavertently counts steps even when she is not walking. If the pedometer shakes or jiggles (which is possible just shifting positions when you are seated) it will log a step or two."
3,Functional with proper usage,You absolutely have to wear this where it stays level. Follow the instructions that come with it and it will do right. I had to find the perfect place along my belt line in order that it work right. It's as good as any pedometer I've used.
2,The data that the pedometer reports is not consistent,We got the pedometer and we have been used over the same path several times. Based in our estimations it is about 6000 steps per turn. This pedometer reports anything between 3000 and 10000 steps in different days.
4,"ok for the price, but a little cheap","i bought some for my employees. it's expensive, so you're not getting something super high quality. button fell off of one of ours. and we had one employee who reported to us that his 'reset' without him knowing, he suspect he sat down and the button indavertently was pressed. other than that, for the price, pretty good and accurate."
4,Sportline 340 Strider Pedometer,"I received this product expecting something a little bigger, no big deal on the size. There are a couple of issues I noticed with this product, one is when I clipped on my clothing it adds steps before I start moving and two the middle button doesn't seem to do anything when I press it. It meets my needs to give me an idea of the amount of steps I take per day. It's not too accurate but I get a ballpark figure."
2,dont buy this one.,"First, I bought it because the size was so small. but the clip was loose. it always fell down to the floor. then, it wasn't accurate after 3-month use. i suggest to buy $20 one and made sure that it is made in Japan."
1,It's a rip-off!,This product is useless. It doesn't work at all and no one at the company answers the phone. I think they are a bogus company just sending out junk that costs them 2 cents to purchase. I purchased them to have a walking contest at my place of employment and now no one can use them and we have to re-buy elsewhere. This doesn't deserve any stars.
1,Waste of time and money,"Waste of money, of course, as this device is very inaccurate. God knows how it passed the quality tests (if any).Waste of time as you try to figure out how to make it work"
2,does not work properly,I did not use this item right away since I have other pedometers; started using it about 2 weeks ago and realized that it does not keep accurate track of steps; it is approximately off by 30 %; need an exchange or credit...thanks
4,Keeps me honest,"I have used this little device for seveal years and have purchased them by the dozens as give-aways to friends who need a little incentive to ""move their bodies"". At the end of the day, if I haven't registered at least 5 miles, I know that I, personally, haven't been as active as I should be. Wearing it for an entire day doesn't accurately tell me how far I have walked since just moving around the house or at a store causes the pedometer to ""click"" - but at least it gives me an indication as to how much my body has moved during a day. By no means is this a completely accurate indication of how many miles I have walked, but it tells me whether or not I have been too much of a couch potato on a given day."
2,Works a bit,"Unfortunately, I ordered two of these having forgotten that it doesn't work well. Sportline used to make a model that worked great. This one only counts steps taken with your right foot if worn on your waist band so you have to double your numbers. If you are wearing loose shorts or pants, you can carry it in your pocket and it seems to be quite accurate."
1,Cheesy,"I guess you get what you pay for.This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered.It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily.I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person.It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it."
2,Final Digit Disappears,"This is a cheap pedometer. Its attraction is that it's simple and may count roughly accurately. I bought several, thinking I'd be able to keep replacing the disfunctional ones with new ones. Silly me. There's a gremlin inside every single one that eats the last digit (the one's digit) and renders it invisible, sometime within days of activating the pedometer. So sorry but I'm going to have to move up to better quality."
2,not very lasting,"I purchased this pedometer a couple of weeks ago, I was initally very happy with it, but it stopped working after three weeks of using it."
2,Lame CD Part III,"You know, this isnt a bad compilation, but they cant really call it a soundtrack cause its missing THREE Annie Lennox songs that are the heart of this great, and very misunderstood, movie.If you are a fan of the movie, then you will recall Demi dancing to two terrific Lennox tunes, ""Money Cant Buy It"" and ""Little Bird."" These tunes marked the clear highlight of the film, but mysteriously are missing here, along with another haunting Lennox song titled ""Cold"" which can be found on the album Diva along with the other two missing songs.No props for the producers of this incomplete disc. 2 Boas"
1,KansasMan,"This juice is disgusting, you would be much better off buying sprite then stirring in some aloe vera juice. I would rate this product -5 if given the choice."
2,Black Belt Requirements,"While I haven't seen this video, I am wary of the advertizing. In my martial arts experience (I too am a second degree black belt), every school, organization, master and/or instructor will have different requirements for their black belt test. While this video may well be a helpful resource to the Taekwondo practitioner, it may or may not be helpful when preparing for promotional examinations."
3,"Good basic facts, but...","All in all, not a bad book...but it is a difficult read. It is a very good resource for the bare facts of the trial, and on occasion Mr. Ginger even attempts a certain wry humor. The tragedy is that he isn't very good at it, and many times it falls flat, the author taking a moment to laugh at a punchline to which he hasn't told the story. Mr Ginger also has a rather disturbing penchant for throwing in bits of trivia at exactly the wrong moments, interrupting the flow of the narrative, a bit like stubbing one's toe while at a full run against a rock that wasn't there a moment before. For all of that, I would recommend the book. As I stated before, it does give one the facts of the trial, and it is a good study of the time and place of the event."
1,Darling Lili,"I was very unhappy with this item. Apparently the manufacturer took some short cuts and perhaps, liberties. Several scenes had been cut from the film and tacked on at the end as ""extra scenes"". I considered the product mutilated. I didn't review it right away because I didn't feel it was Amazon's error. However, I realize now, I should have warned others about it. Ended up taping it from TCM. Could have used that money on other items I'd like to own."
3,What Were They Thinking?,"One of my favorite movies, I was delighted when I found it was coming out on DVD. Imagine my pain as I watched scene after scene hacked up. The missing parts are available as ""special features"", but there was no justification for removing them in the first place. Please - somebody - go back and redo this film. It deserves to be seen in it's entirety!"
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately I have to express a degree of disappointment on this film released on DVD. Whilest I enjoyed the acting & storyline, I was extremely annoyed on the number of scenes which had been deleted from the main film and shown as additional scenes within the main menu - for what purpose I don't know - it just seemed to leave gaps in the film which certainly detracted from the enjoyment. I remember seeing this film many years ago and rated it one of Rock Hudson's and Julie Andrew's most cherished performances - however the deleted scenes really robbed it those memories"
1,A HUGE disappointment!,"Paramount's DVD edition of Blake Edwards' ""Darling Lili"" is one of the biggest disappointments in the history of the medium. Anyone not fortunate enough to have seen this movie in a theatre in 1970 may not be aware that the original 136-minute version was a pure delight, with drama, romance and comedy perfectly balanced. Unfortunately, some years later director Edwards, apparently not content to leave more than well enough alone, prepared an abbreviated ""serious"" (dismally boring) Director's Cut, and incredibly this is the version Paramount is offering on DVD. (A few, but not all, of the deleted scenes are offered as DVD extras; hardly a satisfying alternative to seeing them in their original order and contexts). Paramount might at least offer the original version as an alternative. As it now stands, this is one DVD to stay well away from!!"
3,Complete version Available.,"the complete 137 minute version of ""Darling Lili"" in glorious techinicolor print is available in Australia on DVD for those who have a multizone DVD player. I agree the cut version with all the 30 minutes of scenes cut makes the movie look incomplete (is this really a director's cut??). Fans of the movie should jump on to one of the australian video websites (Video Ezy is good and this is not an advert) and order it. I am presuming DVDs in the States are all multizone as they are in Australia now, where we can play DVds from anywhere in the world?"
3,Julie's magic pulls it off,"I remember when this films came out--at a time when a cultural shift in taste had recently sunk Miss Andrews previous outing with STAR (a musical retelling of the life of Gertrude Lawrence) Fortunaely Julie is not only a great singer but a great actress. I personally rate her as one of only three actress/singers who rate a 10 out of 10 in their ability to perform greatly in a film musical (the other two are Garland and Streisand) Although the songs Julie sings in this film are very appropriate to the story , when she sings, it is so easy to get lost in it, and forget the plot. Because of Miss Andrews good girl persona, it is also easy to forget that her charater""Lily"" is really a spy working agaist her own country.This is a charming enjoyable romp, counterpointed by the swagger of Rock Hudson and the physical comedy of Blake Edwards. The only Special features of note are several deleted scenes. I only wish it had commentary by Mr and Mrs Edwards the DV o Victor/Victoria."
2,Director's CENSORSHIP to be exact,"I have the original film copied from Showtime with the 29 minutes removed by the Director's cut. This ""cut"" is simply censorship. Both scenes where Julie Andrews sings ""Three Guesses"" are removed. Just a guess on my part, but maybe Ms. Andrews does not want ""her strip scene"" to be seen. Removal of these scenes was integral to the story showing how upset she was at MAJ Larabee. I liken this censorship to having pages of a book removed. I was also fortunate to see this movie at the theater while I was overseas in Vietnam/Korea."
3,Pointless 'Director's Cut',"Granted, this was never a great film, but Julie Andrews gave an engaging performance. The revised edition released on DVD lops off over half hour of film. The studio has wasted their time to release this edit; those familiar with this film want the original, regardless of how 'not great' it may be. I will wait for the proper release which should include both versions."
3,HOLD OUT FOR THE 137 MINUTE VERSION,"The full 136 minute original version Darling Lili is shown on Turner Classic Movies. It's Thanksgiving morning and I just finished watching. I don't know what they cut out for the 107 minute version but whatever it was is a travesty. Not a great movie at all but anything with Mary Poppins.....errrr....Julie Andrews (sorry, I've been making that mistake all my life) in it can't be all bad. You'll know if you're sitting down to watch the 137 minute version if there's an Overture."
1,Tell Paramount No,"If as I do you have fond memories of the complete or near complete film do not buy this. Tell Paramount that the least they could have done was to include BOTH versions and let us decide which we prefer.Paramount Studios5555 Melrose AvenueHollywood, CA 90038"
3,Unfortunate,I had heard the reason this movie didn't do well in the theaters was because the studio made Blake Edwards cut many important scenes. I have an unedited version that I taped on VHS and it so much better than this version. There is no flow to this movie.
3,"It Is What It Is, Which Sadly Isn't All That Much","Blake Edwards pushes the envelope on this film by giving us a sexier Julie Andrews a decade or so before S.O.B, Julie has charm to spare as well and carries the whole film as Rock Hudson makes a pretty fly boy love interest, quite a bore.The musical numbers are a treat and there is a few fun scenes here and there it's just a pity this wasn't put together better, on the whole it just doesn't gel, making it more of a curiosity than a classic."
4,See the Film the way Edwards Intended it to Be Seen!!,This is the directors cut of the film. When first released in 1970 Paramount had taken the film away from director Blake Edwards and--instead of a nice little comedy with music--they turned it into a Julie Andrews Roadshow Attraction. This was never the intent of Edwards or Andrews. That is why this version of the film is so much better than the original release. Edwards cut out alot of extraneous nonsense and musical numbers and put back the heart of the film.I believe if it had been released this way opriginally it could have been a hit like VICTOR/VICTORIA was a few years later.Julie Andrews shines as the music hall entertainer with a secret life and Rock Hudson and she have some nice scenes together. Rock`s wooden acting doesn`t help the proceedings and probably it would have played better with James Garner but why carp. It`s a fun movie for Andrews fans and in this version it doesn`t overstay it`s welcome the way the roadshow version did.
4,Director's Cut is Golden!,"I really want to give this movie 4.5 stars... I was really impressed. I had seen the longer version on television a while back, and I remember my father fell asleep watching it. HOWEVER, the version on this DVD is the director's cut and I think it is rather good. You can watch all the delelted scenes, and I believe that Blake Edwards cut the film very wisely and in all the right places. It's just the right length now and it is my firm belief that it would not have flopped so badly if this version was the one in theaters in the 70s. Give it a chance! Darling Lili is one of Julie's under-appreciated treasures."
2,More of a Butcher's cut...,"The review by ""Movie Buff"" said it all. Anything I could add would probable get edited for content!Shame on Paramount! Shame on whoever is responsible for the hatchet job that was done on this beautiful movie.PARAMOUNT - You owe Ms. Andrews, the late Mr. Hudson, and all of the fans out here a HUGE apology!!!"
5,LINDO!!!!,"Que cd de rara qualidade!!!Page 1 A aglutino de diferentes instrumentos e técnicas de produzir música!! Que bem que soa ouvir música que junta instrumentos como: arpa, piano, violonelo,violino... e mélodicas batidas de Drum and Bass! Page 2 Para os amantes do Drum and Bass puro e duro! Recomendo ouvir o 2 cd com o volume bem lá no alto!"
4,A milestone in Electronica,"I heard 4 Hero described as DnB.After hearing their song ""Journey from the Light"" I was impressed, so I downloaded random tracks.The first being a song called ""Spirits in Transit"".This song couldn't be farther from traditional DnB if it tried.Which is what I would have to say about the entire album.That is exactly what makes this such an impressive cd, 4 Hero's ability to tap into some older styles(jazz,early IDM..ect)and do it well.This cd comes off less as an electronica cd as it does a theater album.Heavy jazz influences and very rich percussion add to 2 Pages's ""big sound"".Be warned, this is not for you Junglists, rather its more geared toward the intellectual minded listener.You don't have to be a fan of Electronic music to enjoy this album.Very nice work."
5,a classic in 1999,i have listened to this recording and it is a classic. great programming and live instrutments done the right way. and there is the lyrics sung by great singers. i am a big fan of 4 hero. if you are a drum and bass / r & b / soul fan. buy this c.d. and enjoy it for years to come. 4 hero has set a new standard in music.
4,This stuff just sounds CLASSY.,"It really does. Beautiful, orchestral take on drum and bass, soemthing I really haven't heard before. Fabulous stuff, and it still has a pumping beat. BUY THIS, PEOPLE."
5,98 - the year of 4 Hero,"""Two Pages"" is one album that you simply have to hit replay after every listen. The first CD is full of uplifting and mellow tunes. 'Planetaria' for example (you'd really wish the violin section in the middle could go on forever) is both lush and atmospheric. The second CD takes a 180 degree turn and is filled with hardcore drum'n'bass. While 'page one' displays 4 Hero's musical arrangement skills, 'page two' emphasises on their soundboard-tweaking abilities. All in all, ""Two Pages"" is a superb mixture of jazz, drum'n'bass, classical and hip-hop (courtesy of a guest appearance by Butterfly from the now defunct Digable Planets). Personally though, I wish there was more of 'page one's material. Nevertheless, this album is a landmark in the realm of dance music and should not be missed."
4,Miss 4 Hero and miss the future!,A fantastic album - forgive them the over-indulgent sleeve-notes and off-beat art-work. One of those album which reminds you why you once bought vinyl. Buy. Enjoy.
3,bought as a gift,Read his books years and years ago. This was bought as a gift for a incarcerated relative and as he probably doesn't have a whole lot of other stuff to do I am sure he will enjoy it - or not.
4,Fun Read!,"I just finished The Secret LIfe of Becky Miller and I'm looking forward to the next in the series! Sharon Hinch has created a group of characters that are real and relatable. The struggle to figure out what God has planned for us is something I identify with, and seeing how Becky deals with the many twists and turns that occur in her quest to find out what the Big Thing she is supposed to do is both awakening and inspiring."
2,Not for me,"This was a book that my book club decided to read. It was okay, but just not something I was really interested in. I didn't find the characters likable. I found Becky whiny. I just couldn't relate to her. I am sure that young, Christian mothers may like the book for a quick read."
1,Don't do it!,"I'm a mother of two small children with endless responsibilities, just like everyone else I know. I usually love a good ""mom-lit"" book...but this one was awful! The writing was poor, and after just a few pages I put the book down. Loaded with cliche, the author paints a picture of a stereotypical ""stay at home"" mom. And yes, I happen to be a Christian...it wouldn't matter what religious standpoint this author was coming from. The writing was terrible."
3,Should have read the tags before ordering!,"This title came up during my quest for a good summer chick-lit read. Did not realize it was Christian mom-lit. Nothing against religion, but when one is hoping for Helen Fielding or Marian Keyes but gets this book disappointment is almost certain. However, I did finish reading the book and felt it was cliched at best, dull at worst."
5,Striking,I've only worn the watch a few times so I can't attest to its durability but its simplicity is striking and attractive. It's easier to read than any watch I've owned recently but the date is get-the -glasses out small. After 20 years of clunky dive watches the thin profile and light weight is appreciated.
3,It is great when it works,"After a week of wearing the watch, it started to stop at random times until I pulled the pin used to set the time and put it back in. I sent for an exchange but Amazon has pulled this color saying several people complained about their recent batch.The watch itself looks amazing and is extremely light and thin. The clasp feels a bit cheap and does not seem like it really snaps closed even though it has yet to open on me without me pulling it myself. The strap is comfortable although if you wear a coat with fuzzy material, you will be picking some material off the band.If the watch works consistently, I would recommend it."
5,Great watch,Tis watch is beautiful. I bout it as a gift for my boyfriend and was very pleased. It is sleek and stylish and very modern. It can be used as an everyday watch as well as for dress.
4,"Good, but not great","The face of the watch is beautiful, and as always, Amazon delivered it promptly. My only concern is the band. I don't want to discourage anyone from buying this, but the locking mechanism is a bit tricky to set and get used to. Also, due to the titanium band, some of the band sticks out of the top and bottom of the face. THESE NUANCES are minimal and this is a great watch!"
3,Pleased so far,"watch is pretty good, a bit larger than I thought, but the mesh band is comfortable and easy to adjust. so far so good"
5,Love It!,My 18 year old son purchased this watch and loves it! It is very lightweight and comfortable and good for both casual and dressy occasions. He is very happy with the purchase.
2,Mesh wrist band an issue,"Good looking watch but the mesh wrist band that accompanies this particular model Skagen watch was problematic with band asjustment to wrist. Give me an old fashioned expandable or other conventional wrist bands,"
2,Too Thin & Too Small? For Me at Least,"I'm a watch collector with close to 40 watches in my collection. They range from about 40 to 52 mm in diameter. The Skagen was intriguing for its titanium construction, the mesh strap and the very thin design (which I consider a good thing). Upon receiving the watch though, I was disappointed. I think the watch is too thin and too light--even thinner and lighter than the Movado Museum watch I have. Because of its small size, light weight, and thinness, the watch feels flimsy and fragile. Maybe I am used to heavier and bigger watches, but this watch feels insignificant--if that makes any sense. On the positive note, the watch is beautifully designed and I liked the colors. Had the watch been bigger, I definitely would have kept it, especially considering the exceptional price, but i ended up returning it. On a 6 foot, 250 lb guy, it just looked like I was wearing a paper cut-out of a watch instead of a real one."
3,"Great looks, but.....","Impressive looking, slim, light, classy, but I would caution about the black finish which started to wear off the clasp in about a week. Also, there is way too much glare from the crystal. Go for the grey titanium finish (add one star). I found the clasp secure and the date easy to set."
5,This & Light Watch,Works well. Thin & light. Easy to read display but the date is rather small. Band is a little difficult to latch but is very easy to adjust.
5,Love it!,I was keeping an eye on this product for a while now. It got to my home fast and in great conditions. Absolutely am in love with Skagen watches!
2,Fragile,Glass got scratched after nearly 4 months of using it still love the materials used as well as the ultra low weight
3,Not very good,ActuallyCthe watch is beauty and thinClooks very niceCbut after I used one month laterC I found that the watch band is brokenCas you knowCthe bond is made of the steel wireCand by nowCthe wire will scratch my cloth and I really annoy this situation.
1,skagen watch # 233xltmb,"Very disapointed in Amazon and Skagen for the handling of my skagen watch.3 weeks after receiving the watch the crystal shattered. I contacted Amazon, they said I would have to contact Skagen, Skagen said it was not covered under warranty and would have to pay to have it repaired.I feel this this was a very unprofessional way for Amazon & Skagen to handle this."
2,Nice design but poor clasp design.,I like the watch but the clasp keeps coming undone. It is also difficult to shut but since it open within a few minutes to several hours I guess it doesn't matter.
4,Great watch,Great watch.We had just purchased one at Macys when that same night we found it on Amazon for approx 60% of the Macys price.Ordered it and compared it upon arrival to the Macys one ( you can't be too careful) - it was the real deal.The original purchase was returned the next day :)
3,Watch band,"I can't figue out how to adjudt the wrist band. The instructions are so small you almost need a magnifying glass to read them. And, the instructions, when finally read, don't seem to help explain how to adjust the band. Right now it is a bit too large, but we can't figure out how to budge the darn thing to make it a bit smaller!!! help please."
3,Skagen watch came as advertised and the quality was good enough for the price.,"Good quality and dressy enough. Clasp looks cheap, but it's OK. One cannot see the numerals light up at nite. That's unhandy."
1,Skagen = POS,Looks are deceiving as these watches are garbage. Try changing the battery. If you get the back off you will never get it back on without a press. Cheaply made and short lived. Compared to Skagen I'll take a Timex any day.
3,Cheap Clasp,Really disappointed by the cheap clasp;the watch itself and titanium band was just what i was looking for but once the clasp was released for adjustment it would not resecure;returned for credit and perhaps a better clasp.
2,Skagen Watch--#233XLTMB,"While the watch is a handsome timepiece, the latch on the watch band is defective. It comes loose frequently.I will be returning the timepiece. I have another Skagen watch that I am very pleased with."
3,it quit working,"The watch I ordered came quickly, was packaged very nicely, & looked great. However, less than a month later, it's quit working. I'm hoping it's just the battery. I haven't had it replaced yet. I would expect it to work for more than 3 weeks. I'm not sure I would recommend."
2,Dissappointment,"this is a nice and thin watch, but is almost useless in the dark because it lacks of any source of light; it's a lie that it glows in the dark."
3,"decent, but..","I bought it based on presentation and reviews.Overall it`s a decent watch until now (couple of months)Cons:1. it doesn`t have luminous hands like in the pictures. No matter how long I left it in the sun, I never saw the time in the dark...2. the color on the clasp seems to be going slowly.."
3,Good Watch!,"I tend to like watches that are slim and sleek. My first reaction on receiving it was WOW! But after weeks of usage now, the black color seems to wear off from the metallic parts.. it's kinda too soon for that. So that's a big NO!Otherwise, a pretty decent watch."
2,Looks good but dissapointing,"It's one of the most attractive watches. However I was disappointed in three areas. 1. The crystal is not ""mineral crystal"" as adverised. It's glass and scratched very easily. 2. The catch does not hold as well as expected. Mine unclasped and fell off my wrist several times in the 6 months I've owned it. 3. This may not be important as to its functionality, but although it says ""Skagen Denmark"" which I thought implied it was made in Denmark, on the back in small print it says ""Made in China""."
2,SKAGAN MEN'S 233XLTMB Titanium Watch,"I live in an Assisted Living Facility. Thus, I do not live a rugged life. This watch appeared handsome when I bought it. But within 6 months a crack appeared in the crystal. And the crack got larger and larger, well, enough said. I contacted Skagan about their warranty. It doesn't cover the crystal. They wanted $40+ to replace it, no way. I just cut my losses right there. I bought a second Skagan, different model. It's just laying on my desk. Yea, the crystal shattered on that one also. $40+ to fix that one too. First time, shame on you. 2d time, shame on, well, shame on me! There will be no 3d Skagan."
3,"The watch cannot shining,why???","I received this watch with excited feeling.I like its looking, a man would be stable wearing the black watch.but I am so confused that why the watch is not shining in the dark. The instruction picture shows it can shining. Why the watch I purchased from amazon cannot shining, so I ask if it is broken? Who can tell me?"
2,All Black Skagen,"I've bought 3 batteries in 4 years. Heck, the battery is dead now. The mesh black has faded off. I am basically wearing it for fashion with hopes nobody asks me what time it is. I also got a all gold color one. Same exact thing, the battery is dead and i am wearing it for style. Until I find something that looks about the same and better, probably will not get another."
4,watch,great watch fast ship keeps great time I liked the adjustable mesh band doesnt bother your skinnice clear veiw of the numbers my numbers no glow in the dard as advetised
2,Good product,"the product is good, the ad said that the band was actually titanium and it is not, it saddened me a bit."
4,"Nice dress watch, not an everyday watch","Bought the watch because I wanted something simple I could wear everyday to work, etc. Looks great! Only downside is that it scratches easily, and the scratches are easy to see due to the black paint. If I had to do it again, I would just get the silver version of this watch. It's harder to see scuffs on brushed titanium with it's natural color."
4,the watch is nice,The watch is exactly as advertised. It is thin and the steel band is fully adjustable fits nicely. I've had it for a few weeks and it has kept time to within 3 seconds of the time on my computer. The dial is a bit bigger than I expected (my wrists are small) and might look a little better on someone with a larger wrist but I'm not disappointed. I got it because it is extra thin and light.
5,Very Pleased,"My boss had this watch and I saw him wear it every single day over the last four years. I always admired the sleek design and the classic look of the watch. And when time came to get a few gifts this holiday season, I looked up the reviews here and ended up buying two of these watches.My shipment arrived yesterday and this watch has surpassed my expectations. It is really light and thin and sits very well on my wrists. I wear a Tag now and bought both these watches for gifting in the family, but now am really tempted to hold on to one of these.Pros - very light, very thin and very classic look with formal ware.Cons - the lock looks a bit flimsy, but I doubt if the paint would break off any time.Overall a very good investment for less than hundred dollars. Will buy one for myself as well!"
3,Great Looking watch,A good combination of dressy and sport watch. Very confortable and light. The clasp on the band is not dependable. Needs to be redesigned because it often fails and opens.
2,Great Watch...If It Only Kept Time,"I purchased this watch in March 2012 and have worn it almost daily since. It was my new weekday watch as it was lightweight, sleek, and professional. The large face is very easy to read at a glance. Those are the major positives of this watch.Unfortunately, appearances alone do not make a watch great. Its primary function (for me, at least) is to tell time. Despite carrying a cell phone, I prefer the simple movement of looking at my wrist to check the time. In the past week, I have noticed that my watch was consistently losing time versus other clocks in my workplace. I started double-checking my watch against my cell phone and noticed the same phenomenon. I am consistently losing 1 minute every 24 hours.Given that it is failing at its primary function, I had to rate this item harshly. While it is packaged wonderfully, the core mechanism just doesn't work well enough."
3,Wears out too fast!,I bought this watch for my boyfriend to replace the silver version he had for years. He works at a desk all day long for work so his wrist is rubbing on the desk and after only 3 days of wearing it the black was already wearing off on the clasp side of the watch. I knew that the wear on the black version would be more obvious than the silver version but I was not happy with so much wear showing after only 3 days!! The top of the watch is still very sharp and nice attractive looking but the underside is turning completely silver WAY TOO FAST.
2,Amazing watch! Got a hundred compliments! Black on mesh came off and mesh began breaking apart after only 6 months though!!,"This watch is a beauty. It is sleek and cool. I received so many compliments.Problem is, the black paint on the titanium mesh is coming off.Now, a couple pieces of the mesh are coming off as well.Not as good quality as I thought.Skagen offered to replce it for $33.95 + shipping.Customer service and warranty are lacking.All in all, I can't recommend it."
5,Strap issues? Adjust the clasp.,"People who buy this watch need to adjust the position of the clasp on the band to fit their wrist. It was set initially way too long. If it's too long there will not be any tension to keep the clasp in place, but if you adjust the clasp so the band is effectively a little shorter, this mechanism works fantastically well.I went on a five mile run the other day with this watch and never had any of the wrist strap problems that others had. The adjustment is seriously all that you need to do. I made the adjustment with a small narrow flathead screwdriver.Great product."
4,Love this watch...,I had different skagen watch which I lost when I was not using it.... So never remove Skagen... you will loose it.My watch always has been point of attaraction so I did not weast my time and bought the different modle as the one I had is not sold by anybody anymore.So I just started using it feels the same as my old watch may be bit light as my old one was steel and this one is Titanium.I like this watch as it has date display. I like their mesh design for belt just do not like the lock.
2,Very Dissappointed,"Looks great at first, the band lost it's color within weeks from normal wear, the day display is too small to see. I should have read the reviews."
2,Not as happy with the watch as before.,"This is my 2nd Skagen watch of this style. My first one lasted for years (worn nearly every day) and I finally decided to replace it because it was looking worn. I purchased this watch in August and have already noticed that the black is wearing off the band and buckle area. Very disappointing. The first watch also laid flatter against my wrest, while this new one doesn't bend as easily - sits up higher."
5,Very nice!,"The watch is excellent, packaging is also fantastic. It's timeless and elegant, absolutely stunning. The strap in particular is very very solid. I will certainly purchase more of these watches."
2,Should have believed the reviews.,"Read most of the reviews, but deceided to purchase it anyway. Should have paid attention to the customers who returned the watch. Like others have said, the watch band would not stay clasped and kept falling off my wrist.Loved the watch, too bad I had to return it."
2,Disappointing,"The watch is thing, and nice. But here are the problems:Glass breaks easily, and company won't repair.Band while very strong loses the color quickly, and has problem with the closing mechanism.The Day display is very tiny and if you have trouble reading tiny print w/o reading glasses then you will probably not be able to read it.The Day number is basically 1 through 31, and has no clue as to which month it is. So you have to change it often. Now each time you wish to change it, say you want to go from 31 to 30 then you have to turn the clock dials completely 60 time!!!"
2,The look and feel was great for my husband........,However he had to return it due to the black wearing off of the band. We had read other reviews of this happening but purchased it anyway. We returned it to order a different style. Not up to Skagen standards with the band quality.
2,Skagen Men's 233XLTMB Titanium Watch,"I am sure that Skagen makes a good watch, unfortunately I was not able to experience ownership for any length of time because the clasp mechanism design that Skagen has incorporated on the Men's 233XLTMB Titanium Watch does not stay closed with any type of normal ware. Even after sending it back to Skagen to have the problem fixed it was returned with the same problem. You would think that with the use of one of the hardest mettles in the world it would make for a solid closing mechanism but it is all about the design. I swapped it for a new one and it came with the same problem (Three Strikes). Just shake your wrist a little while wearing it and the clasp would drop open thus risking the watch falling to the floor."
2,Thin and sleek.... but,"I have a prior Skagen that I love for it's size. So when I saw this online in black, I thought cool I can now have two in different colors.The new watch is 4mm larger. I have small wrists so this looks a little out of place. One of the major reasons for going with Skagen was the reasonable size and slimness.Point number two, it's not as slim as the previous watch, but still manageable.Point three, the band sucks. Looks nice until you try to close it around anything less than a 9"" wrist. Seems there are tabs on the backside where it connects to the watch that do not allow for the band to extend downward past 30 degrees (it's preset) no movement.Now I can opt to change bands for an additional $40 or sell the watch outright. Buyer beware."
5,Skagen Watch: Assured Quality,"This watch was purchased as a gift so I asked my husband how many stars and he enthusiastically gave it 5. Smooth fit, sleek appearance, easy to put on and take off, and accurate, easy-to-read face. I was pleased with the price I got here on line as I had just seen this same watch at the jewelry store for almost twice the price. This is the 4th Skagen watch I've purchased: 2 men's and 2 women's watches and they ALL score a 5. Janis of Riverside"
4,Perfect for what I needed,"If you get tired of wearing the big heavy watches that are in style these days, then this is the perfect watch. Just the opposite, I don't even know it is on my wrist. The band is great and looks good. If you need something that looks nice in black and can wear all day then I recommend this.One thing, the date is so small I can't see it, but so what."
5,Good purchase,"I think (for the price) is a real fancy watch, with the use I will know the quality of the machine and materials. It looks better than in the picture, that was a nice surprise. I'm happy with this purchase.I'd recommend it to all."
4,"Slim, elegant, ideal for business wear.","I've bought two of these watches - one black, one the natural gray of titanium. I like them because they are very thin with a very simple, elegant dial. The bracelet is both elegant and comfortable. For business wear they are ideal.I've had them for about three months and they keep good time - a few seconds a week is all I have to adjust them.The gray one is a little hard to read - not much contrast between the hands and the dial. The date is hard to read on both - the numeral is very small but then I suppose that once you've looked at it once you know what date it is and you don't need to look again until the next day.But for a reasonable price you get a watch that looks great."
5,Great watch for small wrists,"This is the second Skagen watch I've owned. I have a rather small wrist, and I like metal bands since I live in the U.S. Southwest - leather bands just do not last long and they're hot. The band is easy to adjust, and I gotten some nice remarks from strangers abut the watch. Love it!"
4,Qaulity Watch,"Comfortable high quality watch. Would highly recommend. Only down side to the watch is the day of the month is small and hard to read, especially in reduced lighting conditions."
4,Classy and light,I really like the light weight of this and other Skagen watches. This one is noticably more classly than most people wear now. It is easily read. My only problem has been that twice the bank pins have come out. I may need to check with Skagen but I'll keep the watch. I like it.
3,"Nice, but..","Docs are wonderful shoes(I have 7 pairs, and swear by them) but these are way to pointy toed. They look very stubbed toed in the pictures, but in reality they look like dress shoes that have some holes in them. They will be returned."
3,A treat for Dylan cover fans,"If you are not already a Dylan (or an Odetta) fan, this is not the place the start. But if like me you can't resist a good Dylan cover, this album is a treat. I've had this album for years on vinyl and jumped at the chance to get it on CD. The real gems here are the obscure songs: ""Baby, I'm in the mood for you"", ""Long ago, far away"", and ""Walking down the line"". The better known tunes suffer in comparison with the oft-heard originals or covers by bigger stars. Odetta's voice is a marvel no matter what she is singing. The finger picked guitars and acoustic bass accompaniment provide a sparse, classic folk setting."
2,I had great hopes ... but,"I am a long-time fan of both Odetta's singing and Dylan's songwriting. Nonetheless I found this marriage disappointingly wrong. This is a jarring collision of styles. Even as unlikely a performer - I hesitate to say singer - as Marlene Dietrich was more simpatico with the Dylan songs she recorded. Further, ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" is musically too naive to justify and sustain a treatment of almost 11 minutes. Interminable. On the positive side, the sound is good and it was a treat to revisit a couple of the rarer Dylan songs from the mid-60's."
5,Simply Brilliant,"In a time when Compilation and Tribute CDs wash through the stores, its very refreshing to have access to this early rendition of Dylan's songs by Odetta. Not the same usual ones dragged out time after time, but including some lesser known gems from the past.The quality of sound is superb. The interpretation of the material (except for Tambourine Man) is easy and spiritual. The simplicity and strength of her presentation belies what a force she was in her time.This is one of my favourite all-time ""Dylan"" CDs and I recommend it to anyone who likes Dylan music. It beats Dylan's Bootleg Series of these songs hands down."
5,Another Hit n' Run for Lolleata Holloway,"Another greatest hits package on the mark. This CD definitely captures the essence of Lolleata's career. With dance floor favorites ""Hit n' Run"", ""Love Sensation"", and ""Runaway"" (with the Salsoul Orchestra) this is a must have for a full collection of club classics.The only thing I was disappointed with was some of Lolleata's hits from recent years, such as; ""Crash goes Love"", ""Stand Up"" and ""Dreamin"" (remix). The ladder of the three was released after the greatest hit package, but still I wouldn't have mind a reissue with the remix. I do know when you record with various labels it is hard to get consent from all of them to use in a collection of songs.Anyway, it still is a must have, trust me on this!!!!!!!"
3,Not bad for the price,I'm the first time user of a rechargeable cordless shaving system. Did not know what to expect from this product but went ahead and bought it since the price was pretty attractive( i paid about $30 including shipping). It's a good product and i will recommend for any first time users like me.
4,Very Adequete....More Than Satisfied,"...had to finally pick up an electric shaver; have extremely sensitive skin, and more than often cut myself to shreds with a blade. This electric razor has thus far proven very adequete; though it does not cut as close as a razor (takes a little more work...almost grinding the razor into the face), it satisfactory conducts a relatively smooth shave. A high-quality shaving unit, at a reasonably economic price. Recommended!!!"
1,It is not for everybody,I do not recommend it because it not cut my facial hair at all. I prefer to use shick or mach 3 of gillete
1,Works but poor quality,"It woks but not very good. Bought a $100 razor shortly after this and WOW! what a difference. Don't waste your money, get a good razor."
2,not as good as reviews stated,"I bought this for my husband b/c he has three razors he uses in stages. I was hoping to eliminate them all with this one. however, he goes a few days without shaving and he said it pulled the hair. it was okay once the hair was cut shorter (using one of the other, older shaver that he has). so then i decided to try it on my legs since I spent the money and the box was torn up and in the garbage (i didn't think i would be able to return it without the box). I figured since leg hair is pretty fine, it would work sufficiently. I guess it works okay if I wirl it in circles, but it doesn't work good enough."
4,Good Buy,"I am very satisfied with the shave I get from this shaver. It is quick and gives me as good a shave as I was getting from a bladed razor. It is also quieter than a more expensive brand shaver I had borrowed in an emergency. The only negative is that it takes 18 (or more) hours to recharge, and according to the instructions, only holds a charge for 30 minutes. However, for the price, it's a great buy."
4,New to electric shavers,"I recently switched over to this electric shaver and I must say I am impressed. The reason why I give this model 4 and not 5 starts is that it takes 16hrs to charge which is a bit inconvinient. But I've learnt to keep my disposable razors handy, just incase.This shaver gives a really smooth shave and it makes the job so easy that sometimes I shave twice a day. I would certainly recommend it for the price that it is selling for these days."
4,Gets the job done.,"With a remarkably low noise level, and what are apparently slower turning blades than on my previous (6 year old) Norelco, this rather low priced model does a creditable job, although as has been my experience in the past, nothing shaves a close as a blade. But then again, nothing removes the top layer of skin like a blade. Easy to clean, and I although I shave 6 days per week, I have only been charging it up every other week. In short, if it holds up for a year, for slightly more than the price of a replacement head, I have a new shaver."
2,"""Shaves below the level of the skin""...does no such thing",I am very disappointed with this purchase. I bought the shaver for my dad and he complains that it pulls the hair and the shave is no where near smooth. I also tried it and I have to agree. I found that I have to make too many passes to get an acceptable shave. I have an old single head electric shaver that my uncle gave me...probably cost $10 and it gives a closer more comfortable shave. I think its more comfortable because it runs at a much higher rpm than the 6613X and it has be running on 2 AA batteries for months.The 6613X book said to use the shaver for 3 weeks before deciding. I guess I will have to wait and see if the shave does actually get better with time but it seems highly unlikely.
3,Norelco,I am a long time user of Norelco Shavers but I would like a a light or similar warning to deshow the ideal time to recharge the battery.
4,Very Good!,"This is a very good razor for starters. This was my first electric razor and I decided to go with a cheaper version rather than the hi-fi expensive ones. This was well worth the money spent. I've been using this one for over 2 years now. I'll be upgrading next year, but spending 60 bucks for the razor and replacement blades over a 3 year period is not bad at all. The shaving is very good, although I would expect just a little sharper (maybe too picky here)."
2,I've had better,This is a very basic shaver. A downside is that the shaver does not work with the cord in when the charge runs out. A good thing is that the charge lasts over a week. A downside is that the closeness is not adjustable. It gets a close shave but not great. The flexible heads are good. I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and got a better shaver.
4,Remarkable electric razor...,"This razor by Norelco is excellent. I have had close shaves ever since I bought this a month ago. Two of my senior leaders borrowed my razor when their electric razors broke and they remarked how good it was. The only reason this is 4 stars is the lack of a power meter on this model. While not perfect, I consider this to be a worthwhile investment."
2,Shaves below the level of the skin....does no such thing,I am very disappointed with this purchase. I bought the shaver for my dad and he complains that it pulls the hair and the shave is no where near smooth. I also tried it and I have to agree.

I guess I will have to wait and see if the shave does actually get better with time but it seems highly unlikely.
4,Can be better,"Since Im using this razor, my face is bit irritated after shaving, it takes more than 3 weeks to get used to it. Another thin is, this razor takes too much time for charging and short time of use(aprox. 15 min) .Overall. it works for me only if I use it in early hours (7 or 8 am) after that, its a mess"
2,Please let customers known the manufacture,"What I want is manufactured in Holland. But when I received my order, I was disappointed by the manufacture. That's why it's cheaper than others sale on other website."
1,Norelco 6613X reflex plus rechargeable cordless men's shaving system,"Do not buy this product.I did and regret about it on the same day I received this""shaving system""."
5,Great Shaver,"I have been very pleased with the 6613X. Get close, smooth shaves and charge lasts for at least ten day's shaves."
5,Beats paying through the nose for Gillette,"Why pay ridiculous prices for Gillette's razors when you can buy the Norelco and only have to change blades once a year? Smooth, comfortable shave every time. It does take a little longer if you go 3+ days w/out shaving, but for everyday shaving, you can't beat it. The pop out trimmer is great too."
4,Happy Again,"After several years of using a safety razor, I decided to return to an electric razor. After over a month of use, I am pleased with the performance of the razor. It was not necessary to recharge during a two week trip out of the country. It is nice to be able to recharge using the European voltage (with a plug adapter)."
4,Nice close shave,"Not as powerful as the older norelco I had (12 yrs old, only the battery has worn out) but still cuts nice and the flexible heads are great. Definitly sold on Norelco - the screen style shavers are irritating and only last ~1 yr before needing replacement screens/blades."
2,nothing like Braun,"very awkward design, very low power - first I thought the battery was low.. even after letting it charge over 16 hours as it says on manual, still nothing. Apparently, I am not the only one who had that thought. I have always been using Braun and just wanted to try Norelco since it was cheaper but it was a mistake. I don't recommend this product to anyone. Do yourself a favor and buy Braun."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. I have been a long time Norelco user, but after buying this model 1.5 years ago I'm fleeing. Since then, I have had several days with vast swaths of uncut stubble on my face. I have had to spend large amounts of time, going over the same area time and again, only to have it miss over and over again. I end up using a disposable razor to catch all of the uncut stubble. Also, after 1.5 years, the battery is toast. I have to charge it every day now just to get 5 minutes of use each day. It will not operate on cord alone--it requires hours of charging for 5 minutes of use!"
2,NOT A GOOD RAZOR!!!!,"I purchased this razor for like 39 bucks. I tried this razor for a month and half and I absolutely hate it. First, the pop up trimmer is very cheap and does a lousy job. But most importantly, this electric razor is simply not powerful enough. I have to shave over an area three or four times and that leaves razor burn. I find myself going to a disposable sometimes when this razor won't cut after going over an area five times. Maybe this would be a good razor if you are just beginning, but I'm returning this junk and buying something better. NOT GOOD."
4,overall a good razor,"Overall this is a good electric razor if you want a solid product at a good price. I purchased this razor in April of this year and it has worked great. I bought it after my old Norelco razor stopped working after like 8 years. I paid about $40 for this one and $100 for my other one. Would I have to say that the old razor was better; absolutely but I expected it to given the price. Overall this razor is solid, cuts the hair, gives no skin irritation, and keeps its battery life for a long time. Overall I would recommend this razor to anyone. If you want a better razor you will be paying at least $50 more."
4,Great Watch,"This is a beautiful watch. The thing that I like the most about it is how thin it is. Most digital watches are so thick, you can't get a shirt sleeve over them. I believe this one is only 7mm thick which makes it ideal. The only knock I have on it, is I wish it had been lighted or at least luminescent. You just don't know what time it is in the dark. As others have noted it takes a couple of tries before one gets the hang of using the clasp, but once learned it is safe and secure."
1,Broken crystals and broken promises,"I loved the look and feel of this timepiece. However, within weeks of light usage they crystal broke. Naturally, that is not covered by the warranty. I wonder why? I then ordered a new crystal on my own dime ($25 plus shipping). While I waited, I wore the watch. I needed to know what time it was! During my wait, the watch fastening mechanism failed THREE times, sending my watch to the floor, denting the watch. When I received my crystal and had it put in, the crystal lasted 2 days before breaking on the end of my desk at work (which has a rubberized edge, by the way). ABSOLUTE JUNK and Skagen knows it -- they warranty all but the crystal. MANY other watch-makers warranty the crystal. I will be choosing a different brand today. I strongly suggest you do the same."
2,"Nice looks, but poor service and durability","I have purchased two of these watches, I love the design. The first one had a cracked crystal after only 2 months wear. It was not covered by guarantee, so I paid the $25 + $8.95 shipping, a month or so later it was returned - with major damage to the case back where they opened it. I called the company, and was only able to leave a message. I asked to be called back and explained the problem - no call back yet!So if you would like a good looking watch and you don't mind if it breaks or if the service is terrible, buy a Skagen.Follow-up. They sent a replacement watch which has worked flawlessly since day one. I REALLY like the design."
4,Nice watch for semi-formal dress,"This watch is attractive and rides thin on the wrist avoiding messing up the cuffs on the shirt when wearing long sleeves. It is a good color but limits use in some wardrobe choices. Great choice for blue accessorizing. Just O.K. with other colors. The band is somewhat rigid which is sometimes uncomfortable if worn too loosely. Keeps time just fine...but a little hard to read with these tired eyes. The face is reflective and the hands don't show up distinctively against the blue background, not enough contrast. Consequently, it is not a good ""subtle glance down for the time watch."" You have to pull up your wrist and look...so, I tend to wear it more for going out on the town than for working with people."
5,Skagen is excellent,I'm very happy with my new Skagen watch. It is a very attractive timepiece and keeps good time. I especially like its slim profile. It was an excellent value.
