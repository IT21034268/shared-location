4,GREAT book for dads-to-be!,"This book has been extremely helpful for my husband, particularly in dealing with me. I bought him this book to help get his mind on the pregnancy and the impending arrival of our baby, but it's done way more than that. Every time I get hormonal, or say something crazy, or want him to rub and talk to my belly, he says ""the book said you were gonna do that."" It really makes it easier for him to see me go through all this when he knows what to expect. It also speaks a lot to his feelings, and he's been doing a lot of what the book says too - so it makes him feel a little bit more normal. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it didn't have information on fetal development, and the information is arranged more by month than by week (we typically go week to week). Having babies is a big deal, but to know that others have had similar circumstances, and that all the emotions and side effects are normal is a great help!"
3,"Basic intro, lacks depth","This book is focused on the father's side of pregnancy. While I was looking for a factual, detailed guide to what goes on with the woman and baby, and how to prepare for the birth itself, this book glosses over those subjects and instead spends a lot of time talking about how the man feels. Mostly talks about how dads feel left out emotionally, what their main fears are related to pregnancy and fatherhood, and other psychological issues. If the psychological aspects are what you're interested in, this is the book for you. If you're looking for some substance in the areas of pregnancy and childbirth, I suggest you look elsewhere."
4,The only book that I needed,"This book was very informative and I do not think an expectant father would need anything else. In fact, I tried to talk my wife out of buying herself books because I thought this was enough considering Google is handy for specific questions.What I did not like is that it is 99% text and considering I have the attention span of my soon-to-be new baby, I found it hard to read at times. That being said, you can read the whole book in a day or two and then reference back to it through the pregnancy since basically each chapter corresponds to a month of the pregnancy.***Keep in mind this deals with just the pregnancy and you will need another book for how to change diapers and things like that. I recommend the Baby Instruction Manual. I love it.All in all it was good and fulfilled my needs and I 100% would recommend this book."
4,My husband and I both love it!,"I got this book for my husband, and ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" for me. My husband loves this book! His only complaint is that it's not as reassuring as he would have liked. He looks at my book and it has a lot of ""don't worry, you're normal"" and other feel-good stuff. This book is a lot of facts and humor, which is what he wanted. But even he was surprised how much consoling he would need as a new daddy-to-be! But as far as the practicality of it, it's an amazing read and we're both very happy for it. But ladies...be sure to tell your man everything's going to be all right. He needs it too! :)"
4,Nice gift for first-time daddy,I purchased this as a gift for the father of an expectant friend. He was touched to have received something for himself and thrilled to have a resource on what he can expect and how he can help out through what is a first-time experience for the both of them. A unique gift idea and useful knowledge for the first-time daddy.
2,Written for the Homer simpsons of the world,"Not a bad book, but seems clearly taylored towards the Homer Simpson type of father out there, some advice is good, while the rest of it is almost insulting to one's intelligence, or are there really that many fathers out there that have no clue? If you have a general idea of how to be a good husband or father, dont get this book."
5,New Dad's to be MUST buy this book!,"This is a must buy for a brand new dad. Of allthe books that I have bought on having a new baby, this proved to be the most informative and the book that I return to on a regular basis as a reference. It not only addresses the development of the baby, but the development of the new family. I found that it's insight into the emotional changes that my wife and I were experiencing were remarkably synchopated with our actual experience. I also found it to be very easy to read and follow. I would describe it as an ideal companion book to 'the girlfriends guide to pregnancy', and would recommend both new parents to read both books to get the male and female perspective of the experience. If you have to buy one book as a new daddy, have this be the one. I have just purchased the follow-on book, 'the new father' with the hopes that it equally illuminates the first year of the newborn."
2,Better books out there,"I was excited to get this book for my husband- but after reading through it I was very disappointed. There is too much information about how ""expensive"" babies are (as if Dads are not already worried about money) but the information is too generalized and many times inaccurate. For example when they discuss the ""added costs"" of labor and how expensive a complication can be- I wonder if they have health insurance? All insurance policies are different...ours covers such ""complications"". Why freak out new Dads so much? The section that makes excuses for why men cheat on their pregnant wives also personally offended me. I gave it 2 stars because I'm not a man and I think some of the later chapters dealing with emotions of men have merit. That said- I personally think Dad would have a better time reading some standard baby books though."
4,My Husband Likes It,"Although this book is for my husband he has commented several times that he really enjoys this book. As we are laying in bed he will read aloud certain passages that he likes; even going so far to wake me up to read the comics in the book to me. The books I read have all the details of what my body is going through and he doesn't really need to know that. He is interested in how I am feeling and what he can do, this book provides that information."
5,Loved this book. Great for moms too!!!!!,"Great for the moms, too! Some of the women in my prenatal yoga class recommended this book in order to gain a better understanding of what their partners were going through. It brought me and my husband even closer together during those exciting months! Thanks for such a great book."
1,Would you like a doggy bag for that?,"Absolutely terriable. This book seems outdated. From how he describes his pregnancy test it doesn't sound like he's gone through the process since the 1970s. In many cases his comments just seem stupid. I quit reading after he devoted a whole page to saying that he took his placenta home, stored it in the freezer (along with some of his friends placentas...) then buried them and planted a tree over them. Hope he doesn't grab the wrong item when going in for leftovers..."
1,You should know this stuff already!,"This book presents only basic information that expectant fathers should already know before they read the book, or would be able to ""intuit"" naturally from the course of the pregnancy. Those who don't already know this stuff, or don't have the ability to figure it out on their own, have a real problem in my opinion! Also, it simplistically presents ""typical"" situations that expecting fathers are ""expected"" to feel month-by-month, throughout the 9-month period.....I must be atypical, because I didn't agree with any of the author's ideas of what I ""should"" be feeling during my wife's pregnancy. I don't know how many books out there have been targeted at men's experience of pregnancy, but this is a very bad example of one.Don't waste your time with this book. Instead, concentrate on some of the books written specifically for women, which will focus on more the technical realities of pregnancy."
4,Great for first time daddy's,Bought this for my husband and he listens on his way to/from work. The book is broken out by month which has really helped him keep on pace with the things that are happening to me during my pregnancy and gives him great advice on things he can do or what he should participate in where appointments are concerned. He has become a fountain of knowledge about what is happening during each month of pregnancy and often spouts little facts and tips about the pregnancy and things I can do. It's been great for him and very entertaining for me as his newfound fascination over pregnancy and what I'm going through is pretty out of character but totally awesome.
5,First Child,"This is my first pregnancy experience, and the book is a life saver for the expectant father. Nice step by step explanations and timeline."
1,Not very useful,"I have not completed this book yet. But so far there has been only basic and common sense type information. Information like ""don't let the mom practice kick boxing while pregnant"" makes me wonder that the author assumes the dad is dumb. I will update this review after I finish the book."
1,What a load of garbage,"This book is for complete morons.If you need a book to explain to you that you will soon no longer be the center of your pregnant wife's universe, you need some serious counseling.What a bunch of garbage. I am embarassed that I actually read part of this book -- thankfully, it was a hand-me-down and I did not contribute to the author's pocketbook."
1,Not for This Dad,"The Expectant Father by Armin Brott is one of the worst books on fatherhood I read in preparation to become a dad. There is very little in the way of concrete, usable information and the tone of the book is extremely patronizing. I got this book from my wife and after reading it, I wished she hadn't spent the money on it; burning the money would have been a better use for it."
1,are men really so bad?,You'll only need to read this book if you are an insensitive block of wood. Other than that you'd be better off reading something sensible. Read what your wife reads!
1,Too neurotic,"While the book spends a lot of time trying to convince fathers that the feelings they have are normal, it went overboard. My husband couldn't get past the first chapter because of the overabundance of discussions on paternal jealousy, envy, etc. etc. Not enough discussion of what's going on with the baby early on to balance it out. By the time they get to anything useful, he was thoroughly disgusted with the book. Just have him read your books."
1,Horrible!,"Somehow this guy has decided that parenthood is all about HIM. He is caught up in jealousy, insecurity, and misinformation. He has decided that his goal should be to be a pain in the [rear] to all around him. I was truly annoyed by him and could not get through this book. I was reminded that if I try to be a good dad I will be a good dad and I don't need some fool to tell me how to do that."
3,"A bit silly, but some good information","My husband is reading this one month at a time as I progress through my pregnancy. Although some of the information is useful, much is very stereotyped. For example, one chapter has simple recipies so he can 'help out' around the kitchen. My husband does most of the cooking. The book also spends a lot of time discussing how the husband feels left out the process. Maybe it's just us, but he's not feeling left out and is, in fact, quite glad that he's not exhausted all the time, gaining weight and outgrowing clothes at a rapid pace.Although some of the information is useful and it's easier for him to read this than the technical books I have (Sears, Unofficial Guide to Pregnancy, Girlfriend's Guide, etc.) the book seems geared more for very young or inexperienced fathers."
2,Its a book you can do without,"A very superficial book, which goes through the motion of trying to explain pregnancy and how to handle it.Lacks details and depth. It could have done with more inputs from real dads."
3,"It's OK, don't expect much","I felt like the author kept repeating himself over and over in each chapter.The author is also a very sensitive guy, I leave that to your own interpretation."
2,Overwrought,"This book is too much. I think the best example of how far out this book is comes near the end when the author talks about strategies for salvaging the placenta so you can have some kind of ceremony with it later on.The ""Be Prepared"" book is much better to read, entertaining, gets the information out there, and isn't overwrought like this one."
2,Where's the funny?,"I bought this book because several of the reviewers on this site complimented Mr. Brott on his sense of humor. I just kept reading this book thinking, who thought this guy was funny? Granted, it's one of the few books out there written from a man's point of view, so that was nice. But I was disappointed and now I wish I could go back and uncheck ""This was helpful"" on the reviewers who said it was an entertaining book. Informative - Yes, Entertaining - No.""Bun in the Oven"", (or ""Up the Duff"" as it's titled in Australia) is the book my wife was reading and she laughed herself to sleep every night. I don't recall the author's name, Katz or something. Anyway, my wife loved that book and I enjoyed the chapters she read aloud to me.If you're looking for an informative book written from a man's perspective than this is the book for you. If you are looking for something entertaining, then look somewhere else."
1,bad book,"As a dad, my wife bought this book when she became pregnant. I read the it and nothing seemed to help me. Then my mom gave me this great book called Pickles and Ice Cream a Father's guide to Pregnancy. This is a brief short book which truly made my wife's pregnancy much easier for me to deal with."
5,Book for both dad and mom,"My husband got another book first, but it didn't go over the practical financial aspects, and it made fun of the wife and assumed all dads were absolute knuckleheads. In search of a more helpful book, a friend recommended this one, and we have loved it. I say we, because I steal it to read. The author has great insight into what both men and women feel during pregnancy, and gives practical tips and suggestions for what dad can do to be more involved, help mommy, and how to understand all of the crazy feelings and thoughts that go on during this time. I own the ""what to expect book"" for moms, but honestly, I like daddy's book more! The author says, ""you wife might be feeling... during this time,"" and I think, ""yes! that is exactly how I feel!"" Then the author says ""You (the dad) must be feeling...right now,"" and again, I think ""yes!, that is exactly what he has been saying!"" I highly recommend this book for expectant fathers, and encourage moms to read it too!"
4,"Good, but unrealistic","This book is good and has good info for dads-to-be, but it is written by a guy who seems to relax by giving his wife a 3 hour massage. I enjoyed reading it, but my husband (who is a great guy, by the way), laughed at the unrealistic advice sometimes. These men would have to quit their jobs to be able to do all the things for their wives that are suggested. It's great for ideas, but reads like it was written by a woman (by that I mean that it is all about ""be understanding when your wife is a psycho"" and ""rub her feet every night""), but there is very little to make the men feel better if they aren't having the politically correct feelings about the pregnancy."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"The book is simplistic and preachy. More often than not, you're reading three pages about something that can be clearly stated in a paragraph. Equally often, that material seems misplaced (waiting until the sixth month to speculate about gender???) and thrown in there to thicken the book. I believe, with common-sense editing, this book could be less than fifty pages without sacrificing any content. The few things that I did learn I could have learned from several other books, along with a great deal more."
2,Too mushy for my husband...,"I got this for my husband when we found out I was pregnant. He started reading it but then lost interest because apparently it was too sappy. I haven't read any of it myself, but thought I would review it according to what my husband thought. Too touchy feely I guess for him (and he's a pretty sensitive new-age guy!) Ah well. Don't know what else one should expect from a pregnancy book I guess."
5,Wonderful book!,I love that this book is written in the view of the husband/father. It gives great advice and insight on the process of pregnancy and helps to explain many of the quirks a pregnant woman may form during the pregnancy. A MUSTY READ FOR THE EXPECTANT FATHER!!!
4,Husband likes this book,"Bought this for my husband and he is really enjoying reading it. He even tells me whats coming when he reads ahead. The best was when he saw my bellybutton and said, ""oh yeah, they said that would happen"". Lol."
2,what about my needs?,"This book does have some good information and the month to month format is good though the author is completely self-centered, whines alot and seems to be more concerned about his needs and feelings rather than his pregnant wife."
2,Too touchy-feely for me.,"The information is fine, but I'm a guy. Spare the new age approach.This is Dr. Phil for dads. It's an OK book, but not my style."
2,Very very light reading.,"My husband made it through about 4 pages of this book before it began to grow mold on his nightstand. It was very light on content and didn't help him feel more prepared or informed. He actually enjoyed real books about pregnancy, like Pregnancy Childbirth & the Newborn and even What to Expect."
2,A stereotypical view of men and fathers.,Nothing new in this book. It's the same old stereotype of men and fathers. Sexist and way behind the times.
2,How to make the transition from clueness to annoying,"I admit I'm hostile to anyone who uses the phrase ""we're pregnant."" Sorry, but pregnancy is a medical state in which one's womb contains an embryo or fetus. If that doesn't describe you, you aren't pregnant. My husband is being wonderful and very supportive during my pregnancy, but if he followed the advice in this book, we might not be getting along as well as we are. How about reading some of the pregnancy books your wife is reading and talking to her? It sounds crazy, I'm sure, but it's just crazy enough to work."
2,You can buy better books,"I bought this book for my husband as a gift as soon as I found out I was pregnant. It was in a baby boutique store I like and I just grabbed it, knowing nothing about it. I/we were very disappointed in it. We found some of the information slightly inaccurate. We also thought it could have covered more and was too simplistic. There are so many good, informative, easy to read books out there that do include the dad..... I say pass on this one."
1,Needs work,"Not very good. Lacking in details I feel are important. I thought that Dr. Marcus Goldman's book on Fatherhood (The Joy of Fatherhood) was more practical, down to earth and helpful."
1,Terrible,"My husband called me laughing hysterically about how ridiculous this book is. He read me some parts of the book and I was also amazed at the weird things the author suggested. For example: the author said one of his favorite things he did (and suggests that every father to be should do) is make a hat with a bee on it that says ""father to beeeee."" If you think that is cute, then this book is for you. If you think that is cheesy, I recommend you find another book. We actually threw the book in the trash instead of donating to the thrift store because I did not want anyone wasting their time or money on it."
3,Nothing we don't already know...,"Like every other couple having our first child, my wife and I picked up almost every book we could at the bookstore. This is the only book out there that is targeted to expectant fathers, which is nice, but after reading all the ""What to expect"" books and other general pregnancy books I really didn't learn anything new from this one that wasn't covered in the others. Basically the book covers all the stuff you would encounter - mood swings, lack of sex, and even the fear of the baby not being your own - but this is found in other books too. If you feel you need to read this one, at least wait till it's in softcover so you don't blow over 10 bucks on it."
4,Good book for new dads...,"I bought this book for my husband when we first started trying to have a baby. He has a 12 year old, so it's been awhile since he's been in the baby game. We both liked the writing style, very informative and humorous at times. I wanted more, but I'm an ""information overload"" kind of person.I recommend this book as a gift or for dads who'd like to read up (especially before the baby comes)."
3,Maybe a bit too much advice,"I gave this as a gift to my husband during our first pregnancy. He learned so much, and I appreciated the fact that he learned it from a man's perspective. The only downside for us (and it may not be a downside for you) is that it covers so much information, he can't keep it all straight. I'd recommend skimming the book to make sure it's your style."
5,Awesome book,My husband really enjoyed reading this book. He new what was going on and what to expect.
3,"buy it, but beware...","there is some good information in this book and i did find it worth buying; however, some of the information is outdated. this second edition is from 2001 and may be missing some relevant info. this book also stopped functioning right when i was supposed to start the ninth month. tried deleting and redownloading several times but the issue still has not been resolved."
2,Not too impressed,"After reading up on almost everything pregnancy related, I thought I give this book for expecting fathers a shot. That was definitely not worth doing. Maybe if this is the first book you have ever read about pregnacies you may learn something. Otherwise, just remember ""to be supportive"" and keep reading her books ... you'll learn a lot more!"
5,Expecting first time Fathers,We received this book in the mail within a few short days after we placed our order. This book is very helpful and offers great advice for first time dads to me and in general. The book arrived in excellent condition as promised.
4,Good but wordy,"This is a great book for expectant fathers- it is a bit wordy, so if your partner is not naturally a reader, you may want something else. It does address topics such as finances, fatherhood worries, and mother-in-laws."
2,My partner won't read...,"I don't recommend this book simply because my partner wouldn't read more than the intro. He said it was just like my books and he might as well read mine. However, I do highly recommend Be Prepared! (I saw him sneak it off to work today). It's a great read for me too!"
2,Meh,"If your husband is genuinely clueless about pregnancy and kids, this might be a decent book. If you're fairly educated or have spent time around pregnant women, it's a kind of a waste of time."
5,My Husband LOVED it!,"I bought this for my Husband when I bought my baby books. He read it so fast and kept stopping to tell me ""Did you know (blank) is going to happen? That's crazy."" He is now the go to guy for the expectant fathers at my office and is so understanding anytime I have an issue. He says ""yup they said that would happen in my book, sorry about that""It was great!!!"
4,A good book for an expectant guy.,I purchased this book the day we found out that we were pregnant. I enjoyed this book. I found the humor to be right on but not too much. This book give a month by month blow of what's going on with your partner. I like to go back and review the months that we are in pregnancy wise. The advice is right on and should be for most new fathers. If you already have kids this may not be the best book for you.
1,Better read whatever she is reading,"I read several books on pregnancy while my wife was pregnant with our first child. I bought this one, because it was the only one I could find that was addressed to fathers. I was hoping that it would give me additional information or at least, information on pregnancy from a different point of view.I was rather disappointed with this book because, in my opinion, it doesn't give you anything. I think your chances of doing well during her pregnancy are pretty much the same if you read this book or if your rely on instinct and common sense.I recommend books like ""The Pregnancy Journal; A Day-To-Day Guide to a Healthy and Happy Pregnancy"" or ""The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy: Or Everything Your Doctor Won't Tell You"" I learned much more from these books and they were also more enjoyable.My advice, do not waste your money on this book. Read whatever she is reading."
5,Breath of Fresh Air,"Found this book helpful, to the point and well written. I am giving it as a gift to my friends who will shortly become parents. Specially appreciate the author's humor. I was somewhat taken aback by other reviews I read here (several of which seem to have been written by the same angry person)which express the ""fathers are unnecessary"" point of view. Perhaps they are trying to sell their own books. I found that I had a lot of questions -- some simple and some not so simple -- which this book dealt with in a straightforward way. Although this was our first pregnancy, we'll be saving this book for the next one."
5,great book for moms-to-be too!,"I bought all the female books.... ""what to expect"", ""the girlfriends guide"", and ""the mother of all pregnancy books"", and my husband bought this book....I was not a big fan of ""what to expect"" and ended up referring to and reading his book ""the expectant father"". The tone of voice, information provided, and content flow are great. I would recommend this for women (as well as men). It is also nice because it provides financial planning and life planning information that many of the women-geared books do not offer (hard to believe, I know)."
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm going to be honest - this book is terrible. While it's well researched and the facts are accurate, the tone is horrific. The author seems to think men should take control of their partners' pregnancies and asks men to tell their partners what to do, how to eat, when to rest, how to breastfeed, etc. It's terribly condescending and paternalistic in the worst way. My husband didn't like it either. I do not recommend it at all. There are so many other books targeted toward expectant fathers that talk about the physical aspects of the woman's pregnancy as well the emotional impact for both partners."
1,"Here's hollow, silly,and time-wasting platitudes for you","The inane cartoons that rarely have much pertinence to the topic set the tone for this trite book that factually tells you less than one could imagine. This book is written for the barely literate neanderthal who needs to be reminded that your pregnant wife should be treated with consideration or that you might care about the development of your embryonic child: it's full of the most obvious commonsense ""ideas"" and more filler than I can stomach. That such a worthless book should be published says much about how few books there are for expectant fathers."
1,Worse than Useless: Insulting,"This book seems to think the only purposes a father has are to (a) earn the money, (b) plan the finances, and (c) try to survive the overemotional antics of his spouse and child.There is precisely one chapter that deals with any kind of interaction between the father and the child, and even that one is mostly about not letting fatherhood interfere with your work life.My husband threw it across the room; we recycled it. It is profoundly insulting to the entire parent-child relationship, as well as utterly useless (for anything but financial planning)."
2,not so helpful,"I hardly touched it. It was given to me by someone. Well, given to me to give to my husband when I was pregnant. ""The Birth Partner"" is a much better book, and my husband swears by it, and even buys it for his friends whose wives are getting pregnant. In fact, something happened during the birth part that is almost completely described and covered in the book ""The Birth Partner"". This one is probably a bit too polished (make it less real) for the dads to be. If you are a husband that wants to be involved quite a bit, go get ""The Birth Partner"" instead of this."
2,"Long on psychology, short on practicality","Whether this book will interest you depends to a large extent on what you're looking for as an expectant father. It was not particularly what I was looking for, but other people might find it useful. The focus of the book is on emotional and psychological reactions, and generally non-specific touchy-feely topics (""What You're Going Through""... ""What She's Going Through,"" etc.) As a new dad, I want to know stuff like how to change a diaper (like most men without kids, I haven't a clue), what I should be thinking about in terms of saving for college (tax issues, investment vehicles), whether I can take my wife to a smoke-filled restaurant once or twice, etc., topics that are glossed over in this book. If you want suggestions for keeping your wife happy, like giving her a foot massage, this book is for you. If you want more practical advice (and I assume this is what most guys are looking for), this book is not for you."
1,full of shallow and trite observations,"It's hard to describe this book without insulting the author for this ridiculous and shallow work; indeed, I often felt my intelligence insulted when I read it. It adopts the most demeaning and infantile attitude towards the men who are supposed to read it: as if we need to be continuously reminded that pregnancy and birth are life-changing events, and the book often stupidly reminds its supposed audience that our wives' experiences are physiological and emotional or that we men have roles to play.The book's least-common-intelligence tone can be appreciated in 3 minutes by leafing through the stupid and unnecessary cartoons that provide filler to expand the book. They aptly appeal to an audience with short attention spans and a hunger for pointless diversion--and they rarely have anything to do with the book!"
4,Good advice for the 1st time dad.,"My wife bought this for me for the birth of our first child. Very informative, sometimes humerous, and easy to read. I particuarly liked that it was broken down by months during the pregnancy. This allowed me to read a chapter or two at a time which covered the relevant time frame. I am now re-reading the book as a refresher as we are expecting our second child. I liked it well enough that I just bought a copy for a friend who is expecting his first child. This is a good book to ease your anxiety!"
2,"Helpful yet not deep, far too much merchandizing","This book is filled with a lot of information that becomes helpful along the way and it's directed to first time Dads. There are many categories of information that one has to learn, such as the products that one has to buy, and it's amazing to me how I didn't know any of it. I had never taken care of a baby or learned much about the subject, so I got a lot out of The Expectant Father.After reading this book, I saw one of his instructional videos and then seeing him talk, I understood much better how passionate he is about his work and the commercial aspects. It's a kind of calling to Brott and he has a website that promotes his books, speaking engagements, various products and he even has his own Mr. Dad seal of approval. That's a lot of promotion, but somebody has to do it. I regret paying to see the commercial, yet there was some helpful advice."
4,easy to lisen to on in short segments,good to start and great for most dads but if your going to be a stay at home dad then it would be more helpful to get mothering books. otherwise this is a good informative read.
4,Great for Dads to be!,This book has a lot of great information written in a way the new Dads can enjoy. My husband likes the short chapters but interesting facts and details.
3,Sliced 'N' Diced,"I purchased this set mainly because of the song lineup. While the mastering of these vintage tracks is typical Rhino, so unfortunately are the edits. The short three minute and change songs are untouched but Golden Earring and Steve Miller are hacked. A mere one minute had been shaved off most tracks clocking in at over four minutes except for Rod Stewart and Mike + The Mechanics. The total time for both cd's is at 50 minutes which leaves 29 minutes of unused programming space per disc and that's a lot of Real Estate. Outside of original album re-issues I pretty much am finished with Rhino."
3,average,"The sound quality is great, the interference is alot better but not totally eliminated. The only bad thing is the caller ID, its letters are small and hard to see, does not display the cellular number . they can do better on the caller ID screen."
4,A Great Debut!,"A Great debut. Nothing extremely unusual or original, but it sounds pretty good. A great blend of rap/rock. The Best songs on the cd are ""Toxic"", ""Black Cloud [My fav.]"", and ""Butterfly"". ""Think Fast"" is just another trendy try at making a good fast rap/rock song [which isnt going to happen]. Overall This Is a good cd. If you like Crazytown, I recommend Linkin Park, Saliva, Endo, Kid Rock, Powerman 5000, Orgy, Incubus, And Methods Of Mayhem."
4,This cd kicks,"This cd kicks, and if u like Limp Bizkit u like Crazy Town. they rock teh house ya'll."
5,Thank God!! A Decent Album,"The Gift Of Game is an album that i would recommend o everyone. There music has at last begun to infiltrate the UK through their single Butterfly. But their top musical skills dont end their, their album also contains tracks like Toxic, Think Fast, Face The Music and Revolving Doors. If you are going to buy the single Butterfly, then dont just buy this album as it will be cheaper in the long run as you are going to wnat to have this album"
1,Rap Music's worst moment...,"run-dmc was mixing rock with rap almost twenty years ago, and did a great job with it, so when i hear bands like korn and limp bizkit ape the style, i just yawn...crazy town brings nothing new to the table...same old song, same old insanity, simply tired lyrics...this is one of the reasons why i dont buy much new music now..a lot of artists aren't making music that's real and from the heart...they just care about demographics...but that's what you get when suits in the music biz can't tap their feet...cd's like these only make good frisbees....avoid..."
3,Better off getting Linkin Park,"Crazy Town is similar to Linkin Park but they dont play as heavy of music that Linkin Park plays. I personally dont think that the rap and the soft beats go together that well. I think this is an ok CD, but it could have been a lot better. Trust me skip this CD and pick up Linkin Park you would be glad you did."
1,nope,"How can anyone ever say these guyz are anything close to metal? The only reason they got to Ozzfest was cuz mrs. osbourne recognized the fact that girliez would go to the show to see them. bunch of pretty boyz trying to be hard. pssssh gimme a break. and another thing, i saw a reviewer say ""they mix rap n hard rock better then kid rock"". KID ROCK?!?! somebody kill me please..."
2,Where have all of you been?!?,"I happened to see that Crazy Town (great name! heh-) were on the Billboard 100. Then I listened to the sound samples here. I cannot believe that it's been (8?) years since the Judgement Night soundtrack came out... you wanna hear something that'll make you feel like a newbie? Listen to the Judgment Night soundtrack & THEN come back & tell me what YOU were listening to eight years ago. This stuff isn't exactly groundbreaking, guys. JUST ABOUT ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO RAPCORE CAN PICK UP THE INSTRUMENTS & DO IT THEMSELVES! I'm not talking down on the band; I agree, the stuff is catchy. But TRUE music lovers will listen to this & tell you..."
1,Utter garbage,"Rapcore bands never are very good. In fact rap in genreal is very lame and too cheezy to be taken seriously, but these guys do it worse than the average joe. Butterfly was annoying when it came out, and it's still annoying to this day! this band is a disgrace to any music scene. Not quite as bad as Limp Bizkit, but still terrible enough to vomit blood for 40 days and nights. Words can describe the feeling of filthiness that comes from listening to this band. They're terrible. Don't even bother! It's not worth a single dime. I can pretty much garantee that anything that is from MTV will suck, and this, well, THIS SUX!!! Don't buy at all."
2,not that good,"I listened to this cd and at first I thought it was okay, but then I relised that crazy town don't really have any hard core songs. All they really do is rap. I like rap-rock but this is just to much like just a bunch of guys who want to rap but don't want to be considered rap. Some songs on the cd are okay but on some songs where they do nothin but rap is where I cross the line."
2,¡¡¡A SUCCESSFUL MARKETING STRATEGY ON THE 1ST TRY!!!,"Congratulations, Crazy Town, You have suckseeded in making yourselves bona-fide rock stars! Now what are you going to do? Let me guess, drugs. Makes sense, now that you can get the good stuff! How about afterwards? I bet you will go and render yourselves irrelevent. Maybe in five years you will seem as silly as Krokus or Accept do now! I wouldn't worry about that, though. Music would actually have to improve for that to happen. I guess you probably will have another hit or two. Well, I have to go look for a real band, now, so see you guys (stay shallow)!!Hugs and Kisses,Someone who is bored by your dumb music.P.S. Keep workin' on your biceps, Shifty, or Shafty, or whatever your lame street-cred name is."
2,"a couple of highlights, but mostly lowlights","crazy town burst onto the scene with the cringeworthy ""butterfly"" in 2001, and sold over a million copies of this their debut.while ""darkhorse"" saw the band wither away their rap and hip hop influence, ""giftof game"" focuses heavily on shifty and epics duel rapping style, with a lot of turntable effects thrown in.guitars are crunchy at times, and very basic, while drum work (if used) is limited in range.epic has a much smoother voice than shifty, and you can notice it.overall this cd is nothing special, and sucks alot of the time.""toxic"" is a pretty cool song, but shifty's voice in the chorus sends it grating up your spine.""darkside"" is ok for like 30 seconds, while ""bboy 2000"" is good for the first two minutes, before it gets lost in a mellowdrone state.if you like cheesy rap and cheesy rock slammed head on, this is for you."
1,"Yee Gods, Look at us, we're a BOYBAND!","Take a quick blink at the Butterfly video. What do you see?You see all those mainstream, overmanufactured, sellout boybands... with piercings and tattoos.This album is just a collection of boring, mind killing, hair tearing tracks. Can this get any more stupid? I don't think so.If you try and be a good band, at least be respectful enough not to debut a cover. Thank you."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I was very disappointed in The Gift of Game by Crazy Town. While, ""Butterfly"" is a great song the rest of the album is not. The album is filled with unnecessary swearing and horrible lyrics. The only other song on the album that is decent is ""Revolving Door."" I would not recommend this album to anyone. My advice if you like the song ""Butterfly"" is to go out and buy the single and save some money."
1,No More Fakes In Music,"If I hear one more fake rip off rock-rap band I'm gunna buy a Britney Spears CD. I'm so sick of fakes in the music bizz and these lime-light addicted punks are just that. They would switch there style at the drop of a hat if it brought them more money. Personally, I feel they personify all that is wrong in the music industry. I saw them dancing around in their video actin like they're hardcore but still trying to be pretty boys. Pick an image already. If you want rock/rap listen to any material by Rage Against the Machine and find out just what music is."
3,Great music,I love this CD. The music is really great. However some of the stuff on it takes away from the sound. I think that they are really talanted but I don't think that they need to have so much stuff about sex in it. I mean half the CD is entirely about sex. I don't mind the language so much as his obsession on sex. I don't see why they need that on there. But like I said I absolutly love the music part and the way he raps. Every song is enjoyable to listen to and that is only because of the music. With the possible exception of a few songs. One or two are O.K. lyrically and musically. You'll never tire of listening to it over and over again; I know I dont.
5,CXT totally kick (with the exception),"The Gift of Game, totally rocks. CXT show us both a heavy side in tracks like Toxic, Darkside, Think Fast, & then a much softer pace with Butterfly, Black Cloud. I think if you are a fan of the rap/hip-hop metal genre this CD is well worth a purchase, it has wicked catchy hooks & some good rifts like butterfly (The Chili Pepper's re-make). Revolving Door & Face the Music are my 2 personel worst tracks, you might disagree then again its up 2 you."
2,not very inspiring,"so i guess i should at least be happy that i can say i didn't get suckered into buying this album becuase i heard 'butterfly' on the radio and thought it was a beautiful song. i actually bought this on a whim before i had really heard anything from them. there are a couple of good songs on...toxic is by far the stand out track and black cloud is pretty good. but mostly it's just cliche rap lyrics about sex, drugs, and violence mixed with some occasional rock rythms.i applaud what this band tried, especially with one of it's lead vocalists battling back from drug addiction. but that still doesn't change the fact that the majority of this album is ...with little social value."
3,what the hell is this?,"Crazy Town is a new station to the couch potato's TV. Some may like it, some not. They mix rock with hip hop/rap and expect normal outcome? Think again. Shifty Shellshock's voice is pretty damn annoying. The band I betcha won't be together for long becuz they are a freakin' freak show containing seven guys including three guitar players."
5,AMAZING,Crazy Town is so awesome I can't even describe it. There is at least one song on this CD everyone will love. It is so full of great rhymes and beats and everything you can imagine. There is tons of variety. I garuntee if you buy this you won't regret it.
5,"Crazy Town, far from ordinary.","Crazy Town is new and not very well known, which is a good thing because all the posers out there would tear them up then. Crazy Town has GREAT songs and they're funny too. The First time I heard ""Toxic"" I was hooked."
1,This is a wastew of money,"This album sucks.It has one good song ""Revolving door"" the rest of the songs rely on swear words for people to like them,Dont get me wrong,I haven't got a problem with swear words but it usually helps if a song has decent music.The exeption of this is the song ""Butterfly"" wich has good lyrics and a great tune but I dont rate it as a good song cause its sampeled from a Red Hot Chillie Peppers song.The music has to be original to be worth buying."
1,WHAT THE ????,"crazy crap, the gift of garbage and queers would be a more accurate title. I'm surprised RHCP didn't kick their ass. How much more unoriginal could a ""group"" be. Pretty little ditty from the Mother's Milk cd was much better. For one, it was meant to be instrumental, and all these fags did was put a bunch of stupid worn out lyrics and a stupid beat that wasn't even made by a drum in it that no one wants to hear, well say maybe a bunch of dumbass preps. Rap, by the way, is not even music. It's just a combination of ripped off music styles with a bunch of macho ignorant words written all over it. I'm glad to see alot of others who are RHCP fans like me agree with me. All you others, you are stupid, bulligerent dickwads and i feel sorry for you that you don't even know what music is"
1,crazycrap,"no talent, They thrash and tear with no purpose, spouting now-trite clichés of their own misery. Join the club, dudes (or, as it appears, they already have). Plenty of other bands do this stuff a whole lot better and with much more conviction. don't buy this unless your an mtv f@g"
4,Pretty darn cool....,"I bought this CD having heard Butterfly only once and I thought it was a stupid CD ta first beacuse I hardly listened to it. Then I really listened to it and my fave songs are revolving door and darkside. darkside is something i can relate to ""dressed in black formt he wrong side of the tracks"" is SO me. Anywayz..i wanna go to one of their concerts and meet the lead singer..ooh what a handosme guy! LOL, six pack and all yum!! LOL Im playin!!Jessi"
1,Bland and manufactured.,"What more can I say that the title doesn't? The market was already saturated with ""white-boy rap groups"" like Phunk Junkeez and Kottonmouth Kings being on the scene before Limp Bizkit could show up and influence a nation of imposters, these guys definitely being the latter. Despite whatever individual talents of some of those who were assembled for the band and the album (including DJ Adam Goldstein and drummer James Bradley Jr.), the only thing that's remarkable about the album is the fact that it actually sold a million records, proving that for a brief history in time people actually enjoyed listening to this. The first two singles floundered, the third single ""Butterfly"" took off because the hook was lifted from an existing RHCP song, and after that, the group went back to relative obscurity.Rumor has it these guys have a new album coming out soon. I'll be floored if it charts."
4,pretty okay,"this cd is good if youre in a bored mood and want to be perked. i liked it alot. i hate the boys. they are so nasty and brag about themselves (or at least shifty does)quotes i dont like: ""my name is shifty capone, i make em moan"" ""and there aint no need to brag about the way that im hung""my fav song is black cloud. not only am i a huge fan of orgy, i really relate to this song. im a wonderful driver and have been in 3 wrecks :( so i feel this song is for aimee lou :)"
3,A good debut,"This album is kind of like Limp Bizkit, those Rock n' Rap kind of music. Butterfly is a good song. but it is a Red Hot Chilli Peppers song. There are few good songs in the album, such as Darkside, Lollipop Porn, Black Cloud and Only When Im Drunk. My favourite would be either Lollipop Porn or Darkside. The album is worth getting, but i would recommend you to spend your money on Linkin Park: Hybrid Theory. Its a much better album."
2,ok i dont care for it,crazy town i liked a few of the songs alot of profanity though would not recommend to parents or children
3,Pretty cool!!!,"I was expecting to hate this album, basically because my first impressions were made of the band's contrived textbook nu-metal look and the intro to the album, where the band claim they are troublemakers (yeah, right). However then `Toxic' came on and it just changed my opinion instantly, with its addictive catchy chorus. The most obvious choice of comparison is Limp Bizkit `Significant Other' disc as this is virtually identical in terms of styles and production. However there are plenty of highlights on this album, like `Think fast', the mellow `Butterfly', B-Boy 2000 (featuring KRS-One) and Only when I'm drunk (a cover of a Alkaholiks song). So if you're a fan of bands like Limp Bizkit and (Hed)pe then check this album out because you are going to love it."
3,Good Quality,"The seller was fantastic, shipping was phenomenal, CD was in perfect condition, still in the packaging, the only problem I had at all was that it was an edited version, and that was my fault. I tend to get so excited when I find what I'm after that I neglect specifics, all in all, great product though."
1,Only one good song,"I thought I would like this CD after hearing ""Butterfly"" on the radio... No. This CD is so disgustingly degrading to women! Any female with ANY self-respect will agree with me and put the CD in the trash. And any decent male would do the same. Butterfly is the only song in which girls are not portrayed as prostitutes or just ""sex"". I was very disappointed with this CD."
1,15 Bucks For A Hockey Disc?!?,"Geez, what a ripoff. This hockey disc is very dynamic and can break into three hockey discs, but 15 bucks for this? No thanks.Wait a minute, this isn't a hockey disc, it's a CD!"
1,f#$*&* led zeppelin and metallica listen ot these GODS!,come my lady is the best songforget stairway to heavenforget oneforget smoke on the waterforget bohemian rhapsodylisten to limp bizkit and crazy town and learn to love good music
1,the spice girls of nu-metal,Some kid just told me that Crazy Town is the best metal band. I would have killed him but that would be illegal and I dont want to go to prison for killing a kid. Anyways I looked them up on here to write a review and someone is selling this for 1 cent. That says it all. I was subjected to hearing it a long time ago in school all they are is a bunch of limp dick impersonators. They couldnt play a guitar if there life depended on it. They cant even rap for that matter. I dont want to sound racist (...) (...) Real rappers just laugh at this or they exploit white rappers like Feminem because they know that millions of braindead mtv addicted welfare wiggers will buy it up.Bottom line is this is a complete waste. I hate rap but Id rather listen to real rap than sink so low that i would listen to this crap.
2,not very good,"boring and blah ., listened to the tracks and i sware ive heard this before . i dont mean from the genre or anything . this band just sounds like nothing . i tried , i couldnt get into to it ...try out these bands if you want something and got nothing out of this ....ReveillePrimer 55Taproot"
1,One word: useless,"Don't believe me? Just look at all the people trying to sell their copies of this album for less than a dollar. Crazy Town is nothing more than a Limp Bizkit clone with rapping that sounds more ghetto and more egotistical at the same time. The lyrics are very much in the style of ""Crazy Town is in da house, and we will show you where it's at, etc., etc."" ""Butterfly"" is nothing more than the RHCP's ""Pretty Little Ditty"" intro sampled, with a hip hop beat slapped on it. The look of the video for that single is straight out of the Backstreet Boys. On top of all that, from what I saw, the Ozzfest tours they did were horrendus. Keep far away from these guys. Considering how they've fallen out of the spotlight, that shouldn't be too hard to do."
4,Awesome lens!,"This is a great ling lens for the price, $120.As an amateur photographer, I wanted to get closer to the action w/o having to do it physically. I own an Olympus E-500.* It is awesome for shooting tall building and close-ups of nature.* Not ideal for close range shooting. The auto focus has a hard time focusing even when set to 40mm for regular/indoor shooting.Nothing wrong w/the lens itself, but I wish I had bought a macro lens instead as I see the need for it now that I want to shoot portraits."
4,Zuiko zoom lens,The lens arrived promptly and was quite satisfactory.I would have appreciated a little more info about exact model numbers as lens models change frequently with often similar specs.
1,Can the taste be lower ?,"Henry Marshall's mantra recordings represent an extreme decay of basic aesthetic and spiritual values in these days. Ancient Indian mantras sounding like some folks chanting in a village pub (mostly out of tune and with a strong American accent) show very low degree of musical taste and skills, lack of respect and a complete ignorance of the basic mantras principles. Empowered by a strong commercial marketing, these recordings are quite in pair with modern unhealthy American Hot Dog culture. Not that there do not exist other inspiring mantra recordings in a modern rendering – there are actually plenty of them. But Henry Marshall's „mantras“ are a cheap and unfortunate parody on values which should be treated with respect and deep understanding, thus giving to listeners very false notion about what mantras really are ..."
4,Gripping Reading,Excellent book. Good Pace just like his previous book Impressionist.i am looking forward to his next novel.Way to go Hari !!
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I really wanted to like this book - I really enjoyed Kunzru's very accomplished debut novel and the idea of exploring the dramatic potential of computer viruses is a very interesting one. Transmission is extremely good in parts but the novel as a whole is unsteady. I think he has succumbed to trying to manage too many locations and characters and consequently the novel as a whole becomes shaky. It's still worth reading, but it just is not quite engaging enough. It's a shame as there are some lovely moments. I agree with the reviewer who comments about the packaging which leads you to expect a more lyrical, misty novel than this which is full of spiky edges. I know it's a cliche, but Transmission does feel a bit of a victim of 2nd novel syndrome. I hope that the publishing industry is kind enough to Kunzru to forgive him this book and give him space to grow, because he has the scope to become a really good novelist indeed. Next time maybe."
1,Poor Quality Remote & Probe,"I was very disappointed with this product. Despite the claimed 100ft wireless range, the remote was unable to pick up a signal when more than 20 feet away - even in the open with no obstructions. I though that was pretty bad but to add insult to injury, the probe died the first time I used it in my grill. So, this may be perfectly fine if you are cooking in your oven at moderate temperatures and you do not plan to use the remote function, but otherwise you should look for something better"
4,Much better than Sargent's Dynamic macroeconomic,"This book is much more readible than Sargent's dynamic macroeconomic. It explains all the mordern Dynamic macroeconomic theory in accesible way. Authors also introduce simple numerical methods. If you were dissapointed with Sargent's book,you will be satisfied with this."
5,Sargent/Ljungqvist Book is Macro-Riffic !,Sargent continues his tradition of applying new methods to get to the bottom of macroeconomic phenom'ns. Should get the Nobel one of these years for work in rational expectations and macroeconimcs econometric techniques.
1,Misleading Advertisement,"Misleading Advertisement:I will start by saying that this product is very good, which is why I am shopping for it. I spotted that it was available through Amazon and found most were selling the 1.75 oz box which has 5 bags x .35 oz. The problem here is that this vendor is selling the 1.75 oz box and showing the 3.5 oz which has 10 bags x .35oz per box, instead. The picture is what brought me to this seller since I knew what I am looking for. People that are unfamiliar with the product sizes can be easily fooled by this type of deceptive advertising. It is my hope that they read this before committing to the purchase."
3,Close but no cigar,"This phone has the voice quality and sturdy build that we were looking for but has some key deficiencies:1) If you recieve a call on one handset, the call can't be picked up on the other handset w/o 'tranferring' the call to the other handset- a serious annoyance.2) It does not have speakphone capability on the handsets-only on the base.3) The maximum handset capability is 2.Other than that it's a good system."
3,Awkward handset with too much static,"I purchased this phone and returned it after two days. Programming the two handsets and base station separately was tedious. Of greater concern, however, was the static and ""tinny"" sound from the handset. I found the layout of the handet to be too awkward -- especially the small ""end"" key needed to terminate calls. I upgraded to Uniden's newer model and have been thrilled! (Be aware that the base station of this model is not wall-mountable!)"
2,Dissapointment,"Sure it's got all the bells and whistles BUT...They forgot the most important thing. Sound!!! I don't understand how my 12 year old cordless actually sounds better that this new Uniden. It sounds like I am in a tunnel and I can hear my words echo while I am talking. If you want good sound, keep shopping. The bells and whistles are fun but not fun enough to overcome the frustration of bad workmanship when this phone was designed and built. Like I said, my 12 year old cordless sounds much better. Maybe I'll go to a yard sale to look for my next cordless."
2,Uniden TRU4485-2 for a month,"Good sound quality, reception, standby & talk time. One handset went out of order within a month. Cleaning the caller id was a pain because even the calls received had to be cleaned on both handsets separately. Uniden customer service was disappointing. I will not recommend it to anyone because it is not reliable and simply not worth the money."
3,It's a pretty good phone- but nothing great!,"Quality is reasonably O.K. but you can't use both hand sets at the same time! ie. if you want to have both your kids talk to Grandma, one on each phone, it's a no go! If you get any distance from the base, it gets very 'staticky' and you lose the signal very quickly.We recently purchased a Panasonic Model TG2730 and are much happier with it!"
1,DONT DO IT! STATIC CITY,I set this phone up yesterday and I am shipping it back today. The first thing I did when I recieved the phone was turnit on to check for static and it was terrible. That is what have based my review on. I have not explored all the options that the phone has as the static was all I need to hear and it was back in the box. So back to the search in hopes of finding a good cordless.
3,Less horrible than reviews suggest...,"Google this product and you will find all manner of bad reviews and warnings. The only problem I had was that the PCI bracket had to be removed to fit the device in the PCI slot, so it's just hanging there in the case, no big deal. The driver(s?) loaded off the disk with XP holding my hand all the way, the new drive plugged right in and after setting up the new drive away I went with extra storage capacity on my vintage 1991 PC. I have NOT configured the device as a RAID unit, maybe that's where the horror stories come from?"
1,Garbage,Everything about the packaging was a red flag. It already looked cheaply packaged. It was missing the owner's manual and one SATA cable. I got it to work once. Then after that it prevented my system from booting up. Stay away from this cheap brand.
2,A big letdown,"Some things you should know.1. My watch lasted 1 week past the warranty.2. If the watch gets too much light or gets too warm it goes bad. You can't tell if it needs recharging because the power gauge stops working. The only way to know the power is low is if it resets and looses all its data.3. Adding phone numbers and other info via TWO buttons is a long and painful process.4. When the watch goes nuts and looses all of your phone numbers, time and other settings, you become a little nuts yourself."
4,Family history,I bought this for my sister and she found it very helpful when she went to Salt Lake City last year.
4,Great Guide.,This book is a great guide for people who are going to make a trip to Utah to do family research.The perfect Tool for genealogoligists.
3,Second Sunday by Michele A. Bowen,The book was written in such a way that it made me laugh. I sure hope real genuine christians do not act like that.
3,Not as good as Church Folks,"Second Sunday was not at all what I'd expect.I'd hoped it was a great sequel to Church Folks.It was in noway good as Church Folks.Even though it was funny and quite humors at times. Some of the situations were believable while some were not .Especially the the one about Rev. Wilson and Sheba.I hope I am not being judgemental but I just do not see that situation happening.No I'm not going to tell what happen, but I do not see those twotogether.To rate this one would be 3* to 3.5*Okay so I can believe all the other situations happening but not the marriage between the Rev. and Sheba with 4 kids by four different men.Okay so I told it.Sheba was only guilty in falling in love with the wrong men which neither meant her any good.I'm glad she did find true love but I would not have believe it would have been with the minister."
5,Suddenly Victories Resound Loud and Clear!!!,"Michele has done it again! Hit with a sudden and totally unexpected transition, the congregation at Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church is rocked to its very foundation. One strategic shift leads to the uncovering of a plethora of unresolved issues, hidden agendas and predatory schemes that affect both the individuals involved as well as the congregation at large. This story is proportionately seasoned with the humors and the hurts of love as relationships develop and the congregation increases. This inspirational work reminds us ""...that God don't play, and that if He is for you, can't nobody even think about standing against you"". It also encourages us to know that God allows the pains of transition to propel us into our new dimension in Him. Thank you, Michele, for an awesome work! I was so inspired that I read it twice!!"
4,A Delightful read,"Second Sunday, displayed exactly what the author set out to show; which is a glimpse at the African American church. Gethesemane Church on it's 100th year of sitting on loaned property is about to experience much of what Paul preaches about in 1 Corinthians. Christians being puffed up, discord amongst the congregation and infidelity.Greed is the driving force of this property being re-claimed by an ancestor of the owner. Redemption and prayer is part of what made this book a page turner. Church Folks her debut,was excellent now with Second Sunday Ms. Bowen has rapidly become one of my top 10.Keep up the good work you have definitely satiated this Christians soul."
5,A Sunday To Remember,"A wonderful laugh out loud page turner. I really enjoyed Second Sunday. I loved Church Folk and I've been waiting for Ms. Bowen to write another novel. A must read, you want be disappointed."
4,review,greatgood this product was a very successfully thing and i really did enjoy the way it helps me. It is something else.
2,broadway stage production,"this album like the cd tyranny reminds of stage productions theres some good parts but overall its not a cd i keep going back to the music is very good but the vocals for me dont come acrossed as inspired but that may be fine for others its just that if i listen to music of this style i would like to hear a vocalist sing in a style like steve walsh, john elefhante, or old phil collins, ex.and then there were three, or john wetton, trevor horn, all those singers come across as if what they have to say is important and with passion the singer on these cds doesnt, sorry to say thats just my opinion, in closing i dont hate this cd its just that there is not enough of what i do like on this cd for me to go back and listen to"
2,this album is a joke to all prog-metal bands out there,"If you want better progressive metal, stay away from this album, i reccomened you just download the song ""ghostship"", that song is the album. The piano solo in the middle of the song is really really good. Overall the keyboards aren't good, the vocalist sounds like Geoff Tate on crack, yet Geoff Tate is an excellent vocalist mind you, but the vocalist for this band ruins it. The guitars are shameful, and there is no power to the drums or bass.Dream Theater is a deffinit, but Symphony X or Pain of Salvation might also wet your whistle."
2,Big Letdown!,"I purchased this CD based on the ""high recommendations"" of other reviewers and found it extremly boring! I tried to give it a chance by listening to it several times, putting it aside for awhile and listening again but it just drags and has no excitement whatsoever. Try Dream Theater, Symphony X, or Fates Warning to see what progressive metal/rock should sound like!"
5,Trace Adkins Greatest Video Hits,"Great video, always enjoy watching his videos. He is always fun to watch. Recommend it highly to any fan of Trace Adkins."
5,Trace Adkins' Videos--Enjoyable,"Anyone who enjoys Trace's top hits, will Love these videos!Since it is not always feasible to view them on TV, this DVD functions as a great tool for viewing Trace's Hits. I would give this one 5 Stars."
5,Fans of Gale Storm,"Have been a Gale Storm fan for years! I was tickled to get this on cd. Mostly because I have a old collection of record player records....Upgradeing my collection was the answer. All the songs on this CD are a must for a Gale Storm fan ,Even if you are not ...Its very very good !!! And easy to listen to!!!!!"
2,mesh roof sides tapers down too much,"My husband goes camping alot with the boy scouts. The tent is not roomy enough for 3 cots. We also did not know it had a mesh roof. Even with the fly on top, on cool nights it would get damp in the tent. The material doesn't seem rugged enough even for our summer use. The screen room isn't tall enough to stand comfortably. This tent would be great for the once in a while camper. Does anyone know of a large sguare type tent possibly with a screen room or dining fly?"
4,Roomy and Sturdy,"This particular tent is roomy and sturdy. The screen room is an added feature even though it has no floor (a tarp is useful). It didn't rain on our camping trip, but previous Coleman tents I've used have held up quite well in rainy conditions. The middle portion of the tent is high enough for an adult to stand up, and the smaller room was large enough to fit a queen-size air mattress. Two adults and two pre-teens camped comfortably with no problem. The only complaint is the instructions weren't very clear. The color-coded poles were not marked properly and the tent had to be disassembled and reconfigured."
2,Leaks like a sieve!!,"In spite of the name ""Weathermaster"" it leaks like a sieve through the rainfly!! It offers no protection from rain whatsoever!!"
5,The Wife Loved It,My Wife is always looking for this perfume and we seem to only be able to find it online to order since most stores do not carry it.
2,"Love MV, but this book was too quirky for me.","Although there was the occasional astute observation, most of the chapters were just completely made up and abit too tongue in cheek for me. There was nothing real for a person to sink their teeth into and laugh with true recognition. As a year rounder, I might enjoy reading this as a column in the MV Times, but was disappointed by the book."
5,The techniques work,"One of my friends used the techniques in this book and ""pitched"" herself into a new and better job in three weeks. And it's summer, usually a dead season for job hunting. The techniques work."
5,Awesome--the best career guide I've read.,This book has inside information I've never seen before. I can't recommend it highly enough!
5,It speaks to you deep down.,"wonderful music. I think everyone would enjoy this regardless of your musical tastes.I love rock and roll and this is so far removed from that but I still enjoyed it... a great stress reliever but not so ""high brow"" as classical.."
5,THE FAIRY RING SUITE,"THIS MUSIC HAS HELPED ME THRU VERY ROUGH TIMES. IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. IT HELPED ME RELAX WHEN MEDICATIONS COULDN'T. EVERYTHING GOES MUCH BETTER WHEN I LISTEN TO THIS. IT GIVES ME HOPE,PEACE,A LIGHT HEART AND SO MUCH JOY. I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL MUSIC THAT I HAD EVER HEARD. I HAD THIS PLAYED AT MY YOUNGEST SON'S VIEWING AND FUNERAL. WE KEPT HEARING PEOPLE COMMENTING ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, THAT IT WAS SO SOOTHING AND ALMOST MAGICIAL."
5,Awesome Gift,"I do not know ""jack"" about tools but this is what my brother wanted. He, his coworkers and friends freaked out about this tool. It makes nail driving seem second nature. It's balanced and just cries to have you drive nails through it. Best gift I bought on a whim."
5,Great faucet - easy install and well made,Really like this product - wasn't so big like some of the other goose neck type faucets and the install was pretty easy. Doesn't leak and Delta parts are easy to find. Main reasons why we chose this faucet.
5,Great Video and a Collector's Item,"A Retrospective of Richard and Karen Carpenter's career. 11 of them never released on video This particular video offers some rare footage from their TV Specials including a never seen before clip to ""From This Moment On"" A Great Anniversary Celebration"
2,A trifle for the truly dedicated,"Even if, like me, you have an appreciation of the Carpenters that goes beyond their camp appeal, this selection of performances from various TV specials functions only as camp. The hits are familiar and the performances so robotically professional that there's not much to do but gape at the awful 70s sets and Karen's brutally unflattering outfits. There are only a few songs, and the whole thing goes by in a flash. Probably not worth owning unless you're a Carpenters completist."
5,star wars clone blaster,My boys 7 and 9 really love this toy. My only problem with it was how hard it is to find replacement bullets.
5,West of Paradise Run,"The western novel, West of Paradise Run, is one of the best books that I have ever read. Actually, I have never read a novel that was fair to the black soldier who served nobly in the Civil War of 1861 through 1865 until this book.J.J.R. Ramey must have done a lot of research to uncover facts I never knew. I've searched for more books in the Jonathan Frederick Shelby Western Series which I expected to come sooner. I can't find them. I hope Ramey finished the 6-book series he talked of during an interview years ago. I hope I'll be able to find out what happened all the way through the end of West of Paradise Run.Bravo J.J.R. Ramey. Please. More on the life and times of Jon Shelby in the Civil War.J. Ray"
1,Pre-feminist relic,"I remember this book, too, and only retroactively became horrified by it. The girl wanted to be a knight, but makes a complete mess of it. She finally concludes that (direct quote) ""having a knight is better than being one."" In other words, live through your husband rather than have a life of your own. The prince marries her because he wants ""a girl with spirit"", totally clueless to the fact that forcing her to give up her dream will turn her into a bitter housewife. This idea that it was OK for women to have careers, as long as they give them up once they get married is a very common theme in 50s popular culture. It should be read today only as a cautionary monstrosity."
5,It IS About Time!,"Kenny has another great album. Each song is different, which keeps your interest, as you listen to the CD. Played on a high-tech sytem, it reveals how well it was produced and mixed, giving equal attention to vocals (awesome) and instruments.Kenny's song-writing talents and amazing voice will make this CD a ""Must-Have"" for his ""Die-Hard Fans"", as well as anyone who enjoys really good music!"
3,Great underatted album from Loggins,"At one point at the turn of the 21st century Kenny Loggins was going to do several songs with Michael McDonald on one album. Unfortunately they only got to the title song (which also features Michael's wife Amy Holland McDonald on backing vocals) As with his most recent effortHow About Nowit is more Nashville oriented than his previous efforts. There are three good ballads written with Richard Marx (I Miss Us, With This Ring, The One That Got Away) which dealt with the fact that he and his second wife were going their own seperate ways."
2,"""It's About Time"" you wrote a good one!","I have,and always will be,a diehard Loggins fan.He's a #1 AOR genius,no question.Unfortunately,this venture has none(possibly with the exception of the title track)of the invention of his old stuff.Sure,you can't write really amazing groove-fusion material and expect to make any sales,but this stuff is such vacuous,radio-friendly,predictable pablum,that you can't help but wonder if playing it safe isn't a sure ticket to nowhereland.Michael McDonald's album ""Blue Obsession"" suffered from the same thing-no songs.You know,with good hooks and a cool ""C"" section?Vannelli ""sold out"" in his own way,and it backfired.These guys and others,according to me,should cultivate the following they already have-it pays off a lot better in the long run."
2,it was about time but....,"yeah it was about time for kenny to finally make this new record come true but...yeah but unfortunately we're far from its best quality speaking...go see him live if you have the chance..he's awesome really...his voice is astounding...hey youngsters go see this ""old man"" kicking a..Anyway you're a great man kenny...all the best.Francesco from Trieste (italy)("
4,Gracefully aged and matured,"The last time I really listened to Kenny Loggins was in 1997 with ""For the First Time"". Before that was series of adult contemporary hit singles from ""Leap of Faith"" years in 1991 - 1992. Well, this CD puts Kenny Loggins back in great adult contemporary root with ""I Miss Us"". There are few other tracks that remind me of ""Leap of Faith"" type of music. Although it's not consistent, I would recommend this on the merit of ""I Miss Us"" alone."
3,Doesn't quite move me,"I hate the thought of writing a mediocre review for Kenny Loggins, but as a true fan, I have to be honest and admit that this is not one of his best albums. When I heard ""The One that Got Away"" and ""It's About Time"" in concert, I didn't think I would be able to sleep until I had the CD in hand, but having listened to it twice, I feel like something's missing. Where are the energy, the verve, the beat that rocked through me and the heart that knocked me sideways in concert? Alas, the tunes are flat on disc and the beat is still. I will always love and support Kenny, but this one is just okay."
4,What A Special Performer!,"With ""It's About Time"" Kenny proves he isstill a very special artist. He hasn't losthis gift for performing great songs withwonderful lyrics, melody, and style. It'sjust too bad it's too short. Highlights,abound and I don't think there's a song thatI didn't enjoy. Bravo, Kenny!"
1,Breaks easily and the WORST customer service,"Had to send the base unit back TWICE due to it not charging the handset. Was able to send it back after many, many phone calls and explanations to the rep. Have had this phone for less than one year and already hate it for it's unreliability and lack of functions.WORST customer service I've ever encountered. Well, except for Dell, but that's another review.I recommend the Panasonic MultiTalk. It costs a little more but worth it."
3,using it as a speakerphone didn't work,"The handsets for this worked great but the mic for the speakerphone was under the machine so to get it to pick up my voice at all I had to lift it up and talk into it. Since this kind of defeats the purpose of a speakerphone, I had to return it. I'm bummed - it worked great otherwise."
5,Great for puppy or small dog,"I bought this crate for my Shih Tzu puppy and it was the perfect purchase for her. She's in and out of it all day. Love the flexibility of the different openings - I usually use the ""roof"" access, and sometimes leave the end panel open so that she can come and go as she likes.The only downside is that it doesn't have a way to hang a water bottle. My puppy likes to tip over her waterbowl so I needed a way to hang a drip bottle. I found one normally used in gerbil cages that attaches with a screw and bracket - and cut a tiny hole in the canvas to push the screw through and hang the bottle. It works great but I wish the manufacturers would change the design to include this feature."
5,Excellent small animal crate,I use this portable crate for my t-cup chihuahua and we absolutely love it! A great buy!
5,Perfect for our puppy's needs!,Absolutely love it. Very sturdy and comfortable for our puppy even as he grows. Great buy.
5,Excellent product.,"I am Venezuelan and sometimes it's hard to get CDs from previous years, at least in my city. And with the gradual Amazon Store family make it possible and very good form and cost. The product arrived in good condition.EscucharLeer fonéticamenteDiccionario - Ver diccionario detallado0.am"
5,por siempre,el album es muy bueno me gustaria poder escuchar las canciones atravez del internet. Me gusta ricardo arjona porque escribe canciones con sentido el es muy famoso en puerto rico y le escribio una cancion muy bonita a Rickie Martin que me encanta. Nunca habia escuchado de ese grupo. me encanta la musica de grupo.
3,"A great guitarist, a shamefully mastered release","I find myself very conflicted writing this review, as Freddie King is amongst my favorite artists of all time. I have almost all of the originals on vinyl, including imports, etc. The material on these ""Very Best of..."" collections is without a doubt worthy of 5 stars. However, these have been ""hot mixed"" into garbage. The levels are set so high that they pretty much max out on every downbeat! Totally unacceptable, it ruins the dynamics, PRAT, and general sound quality. Whoever mixed this should clearly be subjected to some form of corporal punishment. Perhaps a caning at every ""chopped off"" waveform would be appropriate. Anyway you don't have to take my word for it - listen to the samples and watch your levels.Source material 5 stars, mastering 1 star, (***** + *)/2 = ***"
4,BOUND,"This is one of my favorite books that I have recently read. It takes a couple chapters to get into the heart of the story, but once you learn about the life of Xing-Xing you can't put the book down. To read about someones life being so terrible and living somewhere that they are not wanted, it is very interesting to me. I am not living in that situation, and can't not fully comprehend what it would be like to live with a stepmother who doesn't want you. I enjoyed reading this book and learning about some of the chinese culture. Xing-Xing tries to live a noble life in honor of her parents who have both passed away. I was very happy with the ending, that with all the hard work Xing-Xing has done it pays off. I would definitely recommend this book to those who want to read about how living a good life can pay off in the end."
2,Boring to a Tee,"Boring, boring, boring,. Donna Jo Napoli's Bound was completly boring. Basically, Bound is a Chinese Cinderella story complete with stepmother and a missing slipper. Although it was interesting to learn ancient Chinese customs, the story was just a little too out there. For instance, Xing-xing who is the main character/Cinderella, befriends a carp fish whom she believes is her mother reincarnated as a fish. Near the end of the story, her family eats that fish and Xing-Xing is crushed. What the heck! Are we supposed to feel sorry for her? The author also describes things in way too much detail. Or at least the unimprtant things in detail. Bound was also breeching risque in that certain things are described as ""sexy"" and there are ""erotic pictures"" on medicane jars. It's as if Napoli wanted to write an adult novel and wound up writing children's literature instead. So if you're looking for a sappy, melencholy Cinderella story than be my guest. If not, don't even try."
3,Bound .... the book,this book is more geared for a younger audiance. It is the basic Cinderella story but told in a Chinese setting
3,A junior version of Amy Tan,"I read this book in the hopes of finding a quality book to include in my class library for those students who are not quite ready to read the Amy Tan novels I have included there. I found the book to be not as interesting and engaging as I had hoped. The basic story line is interesting, but seems to be lacking in some regard -- perhaps too superficial. I never really seemed to feel invested in the story or attached to the characters.That being said, it would probably appeal to some of the readers in my class of 8th graders, most likely those with a lower reading level."
3,Bound to be Read,"This far-eastern rendition of the universally beloved Cinderella story closely follows the ninth century Chinese folktale entitled, Ye Xian (Teh-Shen). After losing both of her adoring parents, our protagonist, Xing Xing, has been left in the ominous care of her father's second wife. Longing for her stepmother's approval and her half sister's camaraderie, Xing Xing serves the family, both the living and the ancestral spirits, with undying loyalty. Distinct from hundreds of other versions told the world over, Bound's plot revolves around the richness of ancient Chinese culture, including the now forbidden practice of foot binding. As poetic justice would have it, the more commensurate elements of the story destine the antagonist and her not so lovely daughter to the perpetual frustration of their own schemes. Bound is a story of adversity and wonder, of devotion and betrayal, of injury and redress - ending in enchanted fairytale fashion."
3,Ended Quickly,"I think this story starts out great. The characters develop well, and the plot gets set up nicely, but I feel that the book ended rather fast. The rapid pace of the last one quarter of the book was not enjoyable and because of this the ending became less satisfying than I feel it could have been. Overall I liked the story, and her writing style."
3,A disappointment,"Though I love retellings of classic fairytales from foreign countries, I found Bound rather disappointing. Except for the rather gruesome ""raccoon and cleaver"" incident, this book was more than a little boring and the ending was unsatisfying with the princes sudden arrival in the last two pages of the book. Though I generally like Napoli, I am sorry to say that this was not my favorite of her novels."
1,BOUND to make you fall asleep....,"I agree with the other reviews....although i love hearing retelling of folklores, this book was very boring. I couldn't even finish it when i got halfway. I didn't really like the style of writing either. It was too childish for me and should be located in the children's section instead of the teen section of the library."
5,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"Xing Xing is a young woman who is treated like the classic lower class stepchild in Donna Jo Napoli's BOUND.Her mother died when she was very young and her father then remarried. The woman that takes care of her (if you want to call it that) is her father's new wife. Xing Xing has a stepsister who has bound feet and can't walk, so she is treated by her stepmother as though she were a maid.The story is told in the classic tale of Cinderella, with the wicked step-family and the prince trying to find the girl who the missing shoe fits. There is even a great mix of Chinese culture thrown in! I learned a lot about the old (and now mostly) unused tradition of binding a girl's feet.I enjoyed BOUND because I really love the Cinderella story. Xing Xing becomes a character that you want to see succeed and a girl whom you want to find a suitable husband. You care what happens to her and want to know how she survives her mean stepmother.Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"
4,Lovely version of the Cinderella story,"A very nice retelling of the Cinderella story, set in China, with a girl in the mold of Danielle in the movie ""Ever After"" rather than Disney's blond princess."
5,I really enjoyed this one,"This should be one of the first DVDs a beginner dancer gets because it provides insight into the rhythms of the music and how the drums and zills work together. I feel that the dancer needs to understand that even if she does not play zills yet. I love the ""no lead hand"" method, but that is probably because I could never play with a ""lead hand""! This DVD also gets you DANCING with the zills and not just playing them. Everything else is covered in the other reviews!"
4,A Nice Addition to Have,What I liked:Elsa encourages us to be ambidextrous by not using a leading hand.Elsa names and teaches 7 different patterns to the drum with various combinations.What I didn't like:Elsa is not facing the mirror with her back towards me (my pet peeve) which made it difficult to follow especially since she is not using a leading hand.The number patterns that she teaches stays on the screen for only a short period of time.I also have Michelle Joyce's Killer Ziller DVD and they both will enhance your dancing with the zills. Both have different things to offer.
4,Lots of new information!,"I was taught the dominate hand method of playing zils, but found everyone I asked who was really good and really fast with zils played with both hands. I now play ambidextrously but have a hard time explaining the concept to my beginner zil students. This DVD has given me some enciteful ideas to help me with my zilling. There were a few things that were a little confusing, I had never heard of ""Balady Triples"" and finally figured out she meant ""Triples"" or what we sometimes call a ""gallop"".Also when Elsa does her exercise switching between ""Balady Triples"" and ""Basic"" it would be helpful if she did it once slow and counting, since for many the 123 1 123 1 123 pattern is a new concept. I was taught Beledi aka Masmoudi Seghir a little differently from this. Otherwise, this would have been a 5 star DVD. I always enjoy World Dance New York products and find them a great value for the money."
4,Great for beginners!,If you've never played zills or have little experience this is a great instructional DVD for the basics. She shows you the basic rhythms that are used most often. She is not the best dancer but is very skilled with the zills. This is far too basic for the experienced or advanced ziller.
3,Pronuciation,"My only comment is I wish it had the pronuciation of the Russian words also. I work in a preschool with and have a Russian child in my classroom, and would like to know some words in order to communicate with him better."
3,"Very basic, not impressive","I am teaching my daughter Russian and was looking for good Russian books for a toddler. This serves the purpose of having Russian words written under the pictures, but the book is nothing special. The pictures are so basic, that I could probably put this book together myself by printing the pictures off of the internet. There is no story, and nothing exciting. I would highly recommend the First 1000 Words in Russian instead."
3,The famous and the forgotten.,"Noir Fiction: Dark Highways provides thumbnail biographies of a number of authors whose dark, claustrophobic fiction qualifies as noir. Among these authors are Americans, Brits and a couple Frenchmen. Many of their names are household words. Like Woolrich, Goodis, Cain etc. Others are far more obscure. Like William Lindsay Gresham who wrote Nightmare Alley, the book on which the Tyrone Power movie of the same name is based.The usefulness of this short, cogent publication derives mainly from the plentiful lists of interesting sounding but now forgotten and out of print titles it provides. I look forward to hunting for some of these old noir gems."
3,Good for basic cleaning,"If you have negatives in pretty good conditions, this product works fine for basic cleaning. I was not impressed with more tough tasks like removing glue, etc."
5,What we all need to help us with the turmoil of last year,"Lucia Capacchione uses all of the artistic modalities to touch those emotions which are often difficult to express. She leads the reader through a series of easy to follow directions and exercises which helps you tap into emotions and then interpret your own words and pictures. Whether you are an artist or a novice, you will be guided through this self discovery process and given samples and testimonials along the way. Capacchione helps you capture, express and understand the your feelings which will release you and allow you to move on. I loved the format of her books, unlike most of the therapuetic books on the market, she offers you exercises that you can do without needing an instructor, follow up projects to expand the process and sample drawings and stories which anyone can relate to. If you are still feeling the effects of the 9-11, this book allows you to process those emotions in the privacy of your own home."
3,Simple but good,"As an experienced Art Therapist I found this book to be a little simplistic and repetitive of other books I've read, however for the therapist just starting out it would be very helpful and gives many ideas. This book is well set out and easy to read and has many exercises which can easily be applied to work with clients.Much of the information in this book is the same in Lucia Capacchione's other book ""The Art of Emotional Healing"" so I wouldn't recommend buying both as there is much repetition between the two.J Thomas"
5,"F.Q., Potomac, MD","This is a wonderful product. It is simple to use, economical and cooks rice perfectly, just add rice and water, push the button down and walk away. I use mine atleast 5 times a week."
1,Guaranteed to burn your rice!,"I bought this rice cooker, and soon found that my girlfriend has an identical one. Both rice cookers have the same problem - they burn the rice no matter how closely you follow the instructions! The instructions say that you should stir the rice if you want to let it sit more than 30 minutes, so that it will not get burned. However, by the time the ""cook"" light switches off, the rice is already burnt black on the bottom! This isn't a rice cooker, it's a rice burner. There's no way to adjust it, because there's only one button. Buy some other rice cooker; this one is a major rip off and greatly lowers the opinion I have of Black and Decker. This should never have passed quality control."
1,Avoid this item like the Black Plague,"This ""security"" device can easily be removed by pulling the trailer one or two wheel revolutions with it still attached. It will break off where the stem (the weakest part) meets the lug attachment. I know this from experience because one of my contractors did it this past weekend (didn't even damage the tire or trailer). I should be mad at him but instead I'm mad at the manufacturer."
1,not good enough,"first of all, you have to get the rv wheel positioned just right so that this lock can fit on as intended. that might mean re-positioning the camper a few times until the wheel is just so. that is the most aggravating part of this product.secondly, it does not seem very secure, meaning that someone can probably defeat this lock if they spend a little time with itand lastly, it fills with rain water and rusts the inside making a nice mess anytime it rains"
1,POS breaks,Exactly as the other reviewer described. I moved my trailer slighly and the steel arm broke right where the pin is inserted. Looks like a good product but it won't keep your trailer safe.
2,good in the right area,"The device works very well when you are in an area that supports traffic information. Like on major highways and interstates near major cities. If your not then it doesn't notify you. However, it may still get you around traffic if you see it ahead and can detour to an exit. This does not always work if your not somewhat familiar with the area. Other than that it's pretty cool. I think the yearly subscription fee is a little high."
3,Area Dependant,"I bought this with a C340. No problem in set up. I travel mostly between Cincinnati and Columbus and both cities have decent coverage but travel even on major highways outside radio reception of a large city and it won't get anything. If you live away from a large city and won't travel much to one, skip it."
2,Only usefull if you are on an interstate or toll road.,"I feel this is very expensive for the limited usability for my personal use. Maybe is more useful if you are closer than 10 miles to a major metropolitan area? Only really reports traffic situations on major interstate or toll roads that I am never closer than 10 or 20 miles to. On several occasions I ran into stopped traffice due to bad accidents and not once was I notified in advance by the traffic feature. All occasions were on heavily traveled state roads, not some hidden secondary local road. For the expense it is not worth it unless you only travel on Interstate or Toll roads."
1,Doesn't do what it promises to do - accurately show the traffic patterns,"This is a great idea but one that is not ready for prime time. The signal is either poor, or the traffic reporting system is very bad. Soemtimes I will be sitting in traffic at 6 mph and there is no indication on the GPS that there is traffic. The signal is poor if I am more than 20 miles away from detroit, so planning my route BEFORE I am stuck in traffic is not realistic with this device. The specificity is poor - in other words the symbols don't tell you whether the traffic is very bad (i.e. how slow is the traffic). It might say heavy, but sometimes that means traffic is going 50 MPH.It is actually sometimes more accurate to just listen the radio.Maybe the idea with tracking our cell phones will come into fruition some day. For now, I would avoid this device. Too bad - it's a great idea on paper."
4,I went through Atlanta without hitting traffic!,"It's really great to get info on traffic conditions ahead and have the ability to route around it, It's the logical extension to using GPS to get around, especially in unfamiliar cities."
4,Would be nice if it wasn't another separate piece,"I hate that this piece adds yet another cable/piece to my windshield. Who wants that? It works fine as a traffic receiver, but I don't like having all the extra stuff on the windshield.Other GPS systems have the traffic receiver built in, or the traffice receiver serves as the power supply and the receiver so only one cable is hanging from the device/cradle."
1,Wonder if I'll ever hit traffic...,"I live in the Wash. DC area and we have pretty bad traffic. I normally take a route that isn't extremely bad but does has congestion. I get no warnings at all.Also, recently there was a smaller side road (Non-Highway but well used road) that was closed on both directions but had no information on this road. The antenna works but Clear Channels Traffic information sucks.Sucks really bad. When I check the traffic information, the only information I get is the main large interstate highways.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.Who knows, maybe the XM traffic service is better but I can honestly tell you Clear Channel Traffic Service SUCKS!Maybe I'll get some traffic information traveling on I-95 somewhere...Sorry for the unproffesionalism but its the honest truth."
3,Adequate . . .,"This product does an adequate job. I live in Japan, and it takes the lesser 100v outlets here just fine. But, I found that when I am charging my iPaq and I am using it at the same time, the charger gets overloaded, and shuts off for a few minutes until it cools down. So, that's annoying, but it does charge my ipaq when I let it sit there. And I haven't had any other problems with it--so, it's adequate."
4,trip to honolulu 75 years ago.,This album takes you back to the laid back island days of steam ship travel. Leon's harmony with Malia's dulcet tones can't be beat.
5,An extensive philosphical commentary,"Written by Jo Ortel (an associate professor of art history and recipient of the James R. Underkofler award for excellence in undergraduate teaching), Woodland Reflections: The Art Of Truman Lowe is an artbook featuring the abstract wooden sculpture and other works of native american artist Truman Lowe, whose bold and original creations set him apart. An extensive philosphical commentary ranging from reflections upon native traditions and cultural survival through art to education and identity, the distinctions between art and craft, and much more adds a thoughtful dimension to the captivating gallery of full-color photographs of Lowe's eye-catching creations. A most welcome addition to avante-garde and Native American artbook collections."
4,Reliable for years,"I have owned this watch since they put them on the market...probably close to 20 years. The watch itself has been the most reliable watch I have ever owned and I have used it almost everyday. I haven't even had to change the battery that often. I love this watch and it has become my most treasured and loved possession.The only negative thing I have to say is that the chain has held up but I have had to replace the clip and jump ring several times. I find this a small price to pay to have such a reliable and awesome watch with me at all times. Wrist watches need bands every so often; so, I feel replacing those two incredibly inexpensive parts every few years is worth it. I bought a small bag of each part at a bead store and fix it myself."
3,"Not bad, would be better with out the ads at the start","All in all, my 11mo likes this one. While many reviewers did noted the complex backgrounds and lots of movement, my son really liked it. I didn't find it any more complex that say an Elmo video.My biggest complaint is all the advertisements before the main menu appears. Really unnecessary and very annoying. Expecially when you are trying to get it started in the car and you can't see what it going on. Compared to the BBBH DVD's, you just slip them in and hit play. They could have put the ads at the end (so we could skip them)."
2,Probably better for older kids,"I bought this video for my 16-month old after watching the Wiggles on the Disney Channel and then buying one of their previous videos-- Wiggle Time. Unlike Wiggle Time, this video had a lot of conversation and a lot of background activity. My toddler showed no interest in either the music or the dancing. The songs would probably be fine for an older child though."
1,A big disappointment,This video was such a huge disppointment. My 17 month old will not even watch it and he is a true Wiggle-Head.
5,Our Absolute Favorite!,"Out of all our Wiggles Videos, and we have them all, my son loves this the most. I think because there are lots of kids in it. The whole video is very simple.It does get a bit corny in certain areas...La Cucaracha is a bit corny. Marie's Wedding is a very neat song and dance. But for all you Wiggles Mom's there's Fun On The Farm- I have to say I'm not big on overalls on a man but these guys sure know how to make them look good. :-)It's worth the buy!"
4,They seem to love it !!!!!!!!!,"I am a first-time gradmother. When I asked my daughter what entertains my grandaughter she replied, ""The Wiggles"". So against my better judgement I ordered it. Well, my granddaughter at 15 months stands still for nothing. But, she sits still for these guys. For that reason I think they are great. Catchy toons and lots of entertainment."
3,"Good music, wiggling not so good","The songs on this video are catchy just like the other Wiggles' tunes. But the video pales in comparisons to older videos like ""Toot, Toot"" and ""Wiggle Time."" The sets and the backgrounds are much more complicated than the ones in earlier videos, and many of the songs show too many children dancing on the stage. Both of these issues make the TV screen very visually complex, and it is difficult to focus only on the Wiggles. The beauty of the earlier videos is their simplicity. My daughter, who just turned 2, can focus on the Wiggles and imitate their simple dance moves in the earlier tapes. On ""Hoop Dee Doo"", there aren't many songs with simple dances--some of them are animated and have no dances at all. This tape does hold her attention, but she doesn't dance like she does with the others. With the complex visuals, this tape may be better suited for older children who like increased visual stimulation!"
2,Disappointed,"My daughter and I love the Wiggles and their videos are a part of our day. We have enjoyed Yummy Yummy, Toot Toot, and Wiggle Time. This video has been produced more recently and I am very dissapointed. Their previous videos have been at a slower pace with calm and gentle backgrounds. This video has hypnotic backgrounds and a much faster pace. I'm not sure I can put my finger on all of the changes. The Wiggles themselves have severly short haircuts which looks kinda of military, and not warm and friendly. Dorothy, Wags and Henry all have a different look and none of these do I see as good. The music is more at a disco tempo then one suited for little ears and eyes. It also seems as though the Wiggles themselves are trying to be more animated and trying too hard. My daughter pays no attention to this video although she loves her other Wiggles videos. I can only assume that some Madison Avenue type got to these guys and they surrendered the precious innocence and gentleness they once had."
2,Dissapointing for a Wiggles fan,"Lets admit it parents: the glory days of the Wiggles are already over. Since getting more money and technology the quality of writing and choreography have gone down. My daughter loves all of the forst three videos - she doesn't even glance at the screen when I play ""Hoop-de-Do"". All of the computer generated backgrounds and kids dancing all over make it confusing to little kids. The dancing is lacking the creativity and enthusiasm of previous videos too. I love the Wiggles, but I don't recommend this one for younger fans like age 1-3. I HIGHLY recommend ""Wiggle Time"" and ""Yummy Yummy"""
3,too flashy and not as catchy,"I wondered what all the fuss about the colors was about, now I know. Yikes! It is enough to give you a headache. The songs are just okay and I didn't see where many of them would stick in my head if I ever purchased this DVD (we borrowed it from the library). My daughter seemed to like it, though. Unfortunately, I watch DVDs with her a lot and I wasn't dying to see this one again, and we have enough other good Wiggles material already that I don't need to buy one I am not excited about."
5,Hoop Dee Doo-You will have this music stuck inside your head,Great fun if you are a Wiggles Fan! My daughter loves this DVD and it one of her favs of the Wiggles. The tape or CD that goes along with this is a blast too. You can't go wrong with the Wiggles and the 1-4 age group. Highly recommend buying this.
5,Very Catchy,"My daughter- 15 months- loves this video. She would watch it twice a day, every day, if I'd let her. The tunes are catchy; they, unfortunately, get stuck in my head, too!"
3,Not their best video,"I Love the wiggles! We have most of their videos, but I have to say we were very dissapointed with this one. The quality wasn't their best and the songs weren't all that ""catchy"". The dances were done by a different choreographer, and the children used weren't as professional as others used in other videos. Our 1 year old son doesn't pay any attention to this video at all!..."
2,Wiggly potty?,"These guys know they are selling to an American audience, could they try to control the accent a little? My 3 yr old is certain the whole tape is about a ""wiggly potty"" and wants to know why they don't show the potty! The songs are only a little catchy, hard to learn since they are so fast, unusual and heavily accented. I agree with another reviewer that the dances are too difficult to pick up on. Also there's a little too much of that stupid pirate - freaks my daughter out. This is our first wiggles video and I'm disappointed."
1,This is too mental,"My son and I love the wiggles. He squeals with delight whenever the show comes on TV. We recently viewed this video at a friends house and we all just sat there wondering what we were watching. Even my 14 month old son just sat there with a blank look on his face. It just didn't seem to have any of the farmiliar bits. I agree that there is way too much Captain Feathersword, who seems to be slightly.....off. This video is nothing like the show, and even the animals seem different. None of the songs are recognizable. No old favorites like Hot Potato, Big Red Car, or others that we had hoped for. If you're looking for something to entertain a smaller child, stick with their Playhouse Disney episodes."
5,My toddler loves this video!,"This is our second video and the one that my husband and I enjoy watching the most with our daughter, who is 20 months old. The music and backdrops are a little more complex than previous Wiggles videos and there seems to be a little more humor. We're laughing the whole time, anyway! My daughter already knows all the motions to Wiggle Hula and loves to have us sing this one to her. I will caution that there is a rather long skit in the middle with Captain Feathersword that my little girl makes me fast forward. I've heard that older kids enjoy it just fine, though."
3,NOT THEIR BEST...,"MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES THE WIGGLES, AND NOW MY 18 MONTH OLD SON IS GETTING TO KNOW THEM AS WELL. WE HAVE ALL THE OTHER TAPES IN THE COLLECTION INCLUDING THE 2 CHRISTMAS ONES. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS PARTICULAR ONE. THE SONGS WEREN'T AS CATCHY AND THE DANCING WAS SOME-WHAT BORING. THIS TAPE DIDN'T SEEM AS ENTERTAINING OR ENERGETIC AS ALL THE OTHER ONES. I HOPE THEIR NEXT ONE IS MORE LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONES AND NOT LIKE THIS ONE :(!"
2,Hoop Dee Do is to much To Do for toddler,"My 2 yr old daughter absolutely loves Wiggle Time so I purchased this DVD thinking she would love it as well. Where are all the nice ""simple, catchy songs"" like on Wiggle Time? The sets are elaborate, the songs are long. Neither my daughter nor myself enjoy this DVD."
4,Hoop-Dee-Doo & Yummy Yummy are the best!,"My 21 month old loves the Wiggles!!! Out of the 4 Wiggles DVD's we have, the songs on Hoop-Dee-Doo aren't as catchy as the songs in Yummy Yummy. Yummy Yummy is a better DVD for the little little one's- less skits, more singing & dancing. As my son got older, (he's 21 months now) he favored Hoop-Dee-Doo. Hoop-dee-doo has much better effects and is more modern. More children are involved in this video and after the second or third time watching, you'll find yourself singing along. While Yummy Yummy used to be his favorite from 15-20 months old, Hoop-Dee-Doo is now his favorite. I'd recommend both titles. He couldn't sit still through the Wiggles Magical Adventure Movie... I'd recommend that one for older viewers. Dance Party is cute but definately outdated. After he got used to watching the other titles, he got very bored w/ Dance Party."
4,Actually it is among their best,"As with the better Wiggles videos, this one has lots of song and dance, and isn't dragged down by a tedious ""plot"". Some of their best songs are ""performed"" and kids play an important part."
2,Worst of our Wiggles Videos,"Our family loves the Wiggles, but this particular tape does not hold my 20-month-old son's attention and I can't bear to watch the whole thing. Instead of the simple blue backgrounds of many other tapes, there are distracting, flashy, backgrounds, and the songs are not as catchy as on the other tapes. Other moms of toddlers I know feel the same way about this video. I bought this one by accident when many people recommended The Wiggles' ""Dance Party"" and I thought that ""Hoop De Doo, It's a Wiggly Party"" was the same thing. Warning to others-- it's not! I recommend Yummy Yummy, Wiggle Time, Dance Party and Wiggly Safari."
2,Not as good as the others,"We have all of the Wiggles videos. My two year old is obsessed with them! This one is the only one that doesn't captivate him. His favorite part is learning the dances and dancing along, and he can't really do that with this one. There is much more random dancing instead of easy-to-follow choreographed movements. Watching any other of the Wiggles videos will get him up and dancing, but when this one is playing he tends to just lay on the floor and watch. I would suggest any of the videos except this one."
5,"Tranquil Voice, Stimulating Music","Jose Gonzalez is a class act. One of his greatest talents is his gift in combining a beautiful, tranquil voice with stimulating, rousing instrumentation. 'Veneer' reflects this perfect combination track after track, and brings the acoustic genre to a new level. It is the perfect soundtrack for buffering this crazy world we live in today. I was introduced to Jose via his work on the latest Zero 7 album. His tracks on that cd bring depth and substance. Likewise, 'Veneer' recharges the mind while soothing the soul...as in my favorite lyric: ""Cast some light and you'll be alright"".I have seen Jose perform live twice and even had the opportunity to chat with him briefly. Watching him live is a treat. He becomes one with his guitar, as if he were born playing it. Jose Gonzalez is a rare talent, a humble performer, and a genuinely good guy. Get to know him...get 'Veneer'."
3,Ok for a First Album,"This is pretty good for those looking for a bit of ""retro"" sounding music. His latest album is MUCH better. This guy is up and coming, though...Also check out his remixes on Zero 7's latest album. Very good."
4,Jose Garcia Live or Recorded?,"I had the pleasure of being introduced to Jose Garcia's music when a friend working for a record lable got me into a secret live performance at an ""undisclosed location"" during Bumbershoot 2006. His first number was ""Heartbeat"" by The Knife. I was instantly mesmerized by his skillful use of the guitar and his smooth and disarming voice. When I finally got around to hearing his ""Veneer"" release with that cover on it, I was a little bit disappointed. Perhaps I am just partial to live performances, but I felt that he was ""muted down"" in the studio and the magic I heard that day was buried in the studio sound mixing. I truly believe he is better left ""raw"" and that if there is some post production to be done it should be on the background music and not his voice and guitar. Still, if you weren't spoiled by a live performance as I was, I definately recommend you buy it. I am - after all - a tough customer."
3,"Great Songs, Lazy artist","I bought veneer because I had heard ""heartbeats"" on the sony Bravia advert. I thought it was absolutely beautiful. Most of the songs are awesome cos you feel that the artist is emotionally invested in the music but the disappointing thing about this album is that most songs are way under the 3 minute mark. dont know about anyone else but that just strikes me as plain lazy,with such acoustic beauties the lack of length is a crime."
3,only 2 good songs,this cd is okay.you really have to be in the right frame of mind to listen to the whole cd. but 2 songs on this cd are really very good.
1,Snooooooooooooooze,"Boring beyond words, the only life associated with this album occurs when the voice gets so on your nerves you have to hit the NEXT button before you jump out of a window."
2,could be a great folk musician but....,"frankly not for everyone. Jose Gonzalez explores intimacy in this album through his melodic guitar, but frankly I was not able to dig all the album, perhaps I was not in the mood? or maybe was too folky for me?. Certainly I have read several reviews and it seems that everyone loves José, I wonder if it is an overrated musician?,or it just maybe that I didn't appreciatted that much that it didn't touch any fiber for me?.There's always something for everyone, and ""Veneer"" is not for me."
3,A WRITERS' CONVERSATION,"Anything by Kurt Vonnegut is good! Well almost anything. I was attracted to this gem featuring two authors of different generations conversing about the meaning of writing in their lives. I expected an enlightening tome that would set my mind to thinking and provide me with new insight.Neither happened. Vonnegut and Stringer are good writers but these interviews just didn't come off well in print. A question is raised as to what the two writers had in common. Stringer gave some good points but Vonnegut rambled on into the wild blue yonder. Of the two, Stringer appeared to stay focused on the questions and provided the reader with insight as to how writing impacted on his life and freed him from his own internal demons.As a collector's item in your Vonnegut library, yes, do indeed purchase it. If you want something more in depth with Vonnegut and Stringer read their works. This text just doesn't get to the heart of their writing world."
3,"Short, yet inspiring","I was able to finish this short book in a few hours at my job. When I was in high school first looking for colleges to attend, the only thing I was certain of was that I wanted to write. Of course life managed to get in the way of that dream, however, after reading this 80 page conversation I feel more inspired to pick up where I left my dream. I was expecting more out of the conversation, but hearing these two incredible authors speak back and forth makes you want to read more and more of their material. I suppose I find it nice to see a personally attached to writers. I would completely recommend this book to anyone who reads their work, and has an hour or two extra."
4,Good read.,"I love all Kurt Vonnegut books, so I am not going to say anything bad abound the book. The book is overall a great book.I think everyone should read this great book."
2,"Waste of money, not of time.","_Like Shaking Hands With God_ is not worth the money of you have read the other works by Vonnegut he wrote since 1980 that spells out his personal philosophy on life, the universe and everything. However, I stand by my assertion that if someone were to publish Vonnegut's collected grocery lists, I would buy that book.This book, comes close. It is short and spare and lacking in depth -- 80 pages of widely spaced larger type font. I am now vaguely interested in the writings of Lee Stringer now, but not enough that I plan on following up on finding moreabout his work."
3,Another drawback!,"Be aware that this system does not feature intercom capability.Whitch means:- You can't have intercom (offline) use with another person next to the second handset.- You can only transfer an incoming call from one handset to the other without being able to introduce the call or even ask the other person if he/she wants to take that call.Otherwise I agree with the other reviews, it's a good buy for that price."
5,Great Product,"I have just under an acre of land, & I can walk all the way around my property with out any interruption. The Blacklit key pad is great. The telephone is comfortable to hold. The only thing I wish the telephone had would be a speaker phone. But over all I am very happy. I have owned Uniden telephones before & I will continue to purchase them. Great Product line."
4,Great sound and range - missing 2 key features though...,"I've owned a variety of multi-handset 2.4Ghz phones, the last pair being Siemens. This one (in my environment) provides greater range than other models and good clarity.Beware two shortcomings compared to a Siemens: (a) You cannot use both handsets simultaneously. Although you can transfer a call between handsets you can't pick up on a call in progress from the unused handset. (b) There is no visual indication of remaining battery life. If you are like me and don't like to charge the phone until it is almost dead - you have to guess.I still like the phone, though, and would recommend it to anyone who needs superior range and wall-penetration."
1,Charging of the Phone,"I have noticed that neither phone will not charge in its base unit. When you rest the phone on the cradle, it will not charge unless you provide additional support to keep the phone on the charging contacts. At present we use a popcicle stick to position the phone so it will charge. This is a trick we learned from a previous Uniden phone purchase. That phone took 2 years for the problem to develop, this phone set took 3 months. We have always liked the Uniden phones for their clarity and sound quality, but a phone that won't recharge is of little use, no matter how great the sound quality. This will be the last Uniden phone that we purchase. At least with this phone the keypad didn't stop working too, unless that will happen in the next few weeks!"
5,Money well spent.,"We needed to reduce the overall flow rate of an autofill for our pond, and could not afford an elaborate pressure or flow regulator. These units are simple and foolproof. You can't go wrong for a very basic method of controlling flow rates. We also use one to place a ""cap"" on the available flow rate to our drip system. Just remember that these are not pressure reducers in the pure sense - if the flow is slow enough, full inlet pressure will appear at the output. But for placing controls on just how much water can squirt in the event of a malfunction or a leak, these are a perfect solution."
5,Work the way they are supposed to!,These Raindrip reduction valves reduce the pressure from the main water line from the house and allow the right amount of water to be supplied to the vegetation.
2,Goopy Mess,"Disappointed in these pricey patches. Too much gel, leaked out on clothing, pulled off of skin. Back to the drawing board, UniPatch. For me back to the old fashioned carbon gel patches."
2,A few more negatives about this book,"Some of the previous reviews have pointed out some serious problems with Stars & Stripes Triumphant. I just finished reading it, and I noted some more discrepancies.Count Iggy could not have gone to the Royal Naval College Greenwich before the Crimean War, since it wasn't established until 1873. Moreover, it was not a place for training officer candidates (that was done at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth, started in 1863). The courses taught at Greenwich were for mid to upper-grade officers, lieutenant commanders and above.The river running through Cork is not the River Lee but the River Lea.Ulysses S. Grant was known to his contemporaries as ""Sam.""In the 1860s there were two battalions of the Royal Fusiliers, not 25. Only during the massive expansion of the British Army during the First and Second World Wars did certain regiments grow anywhere near that large."
2,Stars and Gripes Triumphant,"Stars and Stripes Triumphant was a weak, brief, and very predictable conclusion to an otherwise great series. Harry Harrison may have bitten off more than he could chew, technologically, for the military innovations were fairly limited. I know I was waiting for the submarine that never surfaced. While it was satisfying to see the histrionic and arrogant British aristocracy get their decidedly un-Ambersonlike comeuppance, it was oh-so-expected.The book suffered from failure to further develop (or even use) most of the main characters from the previous two books. New characters also could have used a quick personality and body-building session, especially Gladstone and Disraeli.The book was disappointingly short; there was plenty of room for all that was lacking.Fans of the series will need to read the book, just for closure's sake. But wait for the paperback."
4,Nice Alternate Historical Fiction,"This was an entertaining book. I have a degree in History and enjoyed the obvious research that the author did in preparation for this work. Also, the style was very easy to get into. A solid book in its genre."
4,Interesting idea brought to the painful ending...,"The reason this book gets four stars is because Harry Harrison did such a good job of building the foundation of the story. He deals not just with the USA and England, but on how the European nations were dealing with the events, past and present. A shot is not fired in anger till about page 128. And even after the war there are chapters and chapters of post-war events to tie it all up. Now if only the events and characters of the conflict were as realistic as the logic he used to set it up. But if you've stayed with the series up to this third and last book you are already use to the grand and sweeping scenes that keep the plot moving. Now I know the reason for the trilogy - Mr. Harrison wanted to find a way to free Ireland and Scotland!The plot drives the book, like the last two, and logic be damned.Fun, but that's all."
2,Disappointing conclusion to a good trilogy,"I enjoyed the premise of this series when it first came out, but this book reminds me of an old Monty Python album, titled - ""Contractual Obligation"". That's the way this book seems to be.After the US and Confederates have send the English packing from North America, they kicked them out of Ireland in the second book in this series. So guess where the English are being confronted in this book? Yep - England.Most of the plot was laid out for the reader, but the end (invasion) was anti-climatic. You knew it was coming and you knew how it was going to be done. A few twists or turns would have been nice. Just something that would have made the light in the reader's head go on when reading for a second time.The pace of the book was good, and the plot wasn't bad, but the depth of some of the characters was missing, and it was just too short.If (or when) this series comes out as a single volume, that would be worth the money."
2,World Police (circa 1865),"The concept of this trilogy was fun. It's a Civil War alternate history about a re-united United States at war with a bellicose Great Britain. Lots of fun in the first book, more of the same in the second. Some of the characters were very interesting, and it created a stage on which to explore some interesting political ideas. But unfortunately, by the third book, Stars & Stipes Triumphant, it has turned into a horrible imitation of contemporary politics, with the USA using its superior technical and industrial might to dictate to the world just what kind of democracy the world's nations need. Our kind! It doesn't mater to the first Republican president of the US that the nation he sets to invade (without first declaring war) is already a democracy. The only true democracy is a U.S. style democracy! Let the world tremble at American Might!"
2,Another Beating of the British,"My Overall opinion of this book is that it was lacking in the suspense part, I knew that the U.S. would once again trouce Britain and once again American Ship designs would trouce the Warrior Class. However it was a solid ending to the series. Anyone who calls this insulting to Britian really ought to go to hell. Personnaly I think they could have done better by putting Britain out of the picture. It was kind of a Good Guys triumph book, but it is a pretty good book. I hope you find this more helpful than the critical view of other reviewers (No Offense)."
1,ANTI BRITISH RUBBISH,"HAVING READ HARRY TURTLEDOVE I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD SEE IF THIS BOOK WAS UP TO THE SAME STANDARD.I WAS WRONG .THIS BOOK IS,WITHOUT DOUBT,THE WORST THING THAT I HAVE EVER READ.I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE OR PUT ACROSS HOW CRAP THIS BOOK IS.I CANNOT BELIEVE,FOR INSTANCE,HOW HE MAKES OUT THAT THE WARRIOR CLASS OF BRITISH BATTLESHIP WAS SO INFERIOR TO WHATEVER THE AMERICANS USED.IN FACT, THIS CLASS OF BATTLESHIP WAS SUPERIOR TO NEARLY ALL THAT THE AMERICANS HAD AT THIS TIME IN HISTORY.I ALSO FIND IT OFFENSIVE THAT HE TRIES TO MAKE OUT THAT THE BRITISH SOLDIER IS SOMEHOW INFERIOR TO HIS WONDERFUL AMERICAN SOLDIER.PLEASE,DONT BUY THIS BOOK IT IS TRULY AWFUL.INSTEAD BUY SOMETHING BY HARRY TURTLEDOVE INSTEAD,HE IS THE TRUE MASTER OF ALTERNATE HISTORY EPICS.TO END,I FOUND THIS BOOK SO OFFENSIVE AND INSULTING ABOUT THE BRITISH THAT I TORE UP MY COPY AND THREW IT AWAY,IT IS TOTAL RUBBISH"
4,Thickskin Review,"Many bands go through lead vocalist changes and release good music although it isn't as popular or isnt excepted by many of the fans. One example is when John Corabi replaced Vince Neil in Motley Crue, although the album wasn't liked by many of the fans, that album was one of the best albums that they ever did...""Thickskin"" is exactlly the same way. Johnny Solinger isn't a Sebastian Bach clone, but his vocals works very well with the music. The heavy songs will remind you of the glory days when Skid Row were at the top, but the soft songs will remind you of Matchbox 20 meets the Goo Goo Dolls. Don't purhase this album if you are expecting another ""Slave To The Grind"", but purchase this album if you want to listen to a band that has changed and grown-up over the years, but yet hasnt lost their abillity to rock."
2,One killer song and the rest filler,"""Thick Is The Skin"" is one awesome song. Great guitar riff, great bass, good vocals. It is almost worth buying for that song alone. But other than that, I didn't much care for the CD."
4,Up from the Skids,"Thickskin is one of my favorites of this year. It's heavy, the songs are well written, and the guitar hooks are memorable, and radio friendly. The band manages to keep their classic sound, but updates it to stay fresh. However, I don't think of Skid Row when I listen to this CD. I'm sure they needed the name to help promote it, but the music really stands on it's own. If the name Skid Row wasn't used on this album, I think the music would be able to tear up the rock radio charts. I can't believe the rock friendly record labels passed on this."
2,Skid Joke,"Sorry, but this is one of the biggest dissapointments I've ever heard. Once a great band with an amazing vocalist and good songwriting has turned into a band with subpar songwriting (are u there Snake and Rachel?!?!?!)and mediocre vocals...and worst of all it doesn't sound like Skid Row. I could've never believed Skid Row trying to sound like Goo Goo Dolls, losing their edge or even defecating in their past with the autoparody ""I Remember You 2"". Maybe Sebastian Bach isn't the nicest person to work with, but it's pretty clear The Skids have lost the fire, passion and attitude they were famous for. Yes, it's a shame...this isn't Skid Row anymore. If you wanna listen to the real Skids buy their first album, ""Slave To The Grind"" or ""Subhuman Race"" and avoid this one...and if you already have'em don't waste your time and money. I WAS a fan too."
4,Almost as good as the old days,"First off, new vocalist Solinger is great, but he's no Bach. I saw them open for Kiss a few years ago, and he sounded great live also.This album is very good. Several tracks are strong. New Generation, Lamb, Thick is the Skin, Born a Beggar, and Hittin a Wall, are the best, and would fit wonderfully on Slave to the Grind. The only difference is that they sound more mature, which is not a bad thing.See you Around is a good, mid-tempo ""ballad"", and Remember you Two is also okay. My least favorite tune is Ghost, which sounds too much like Nickelback, who I'm not fond of so I skip that one.All in all this is an excellent album. It just lacks that certain edge of previous Skid albums, probably just because these guys are a little older. However, I'd recommend it highly."
4,Skid Row - it's great to have them back,Yep - Baz isn't in the band anymore and yes this album would be awesome with him - but he ain't in the band anymore is he !The songwriting is a good as it's every been and would say it's on a par with Slave to the Grind.Go buy it - it's a worthy addition and it got under my skin on the first listen
2,it is not bach,"I have been a SKID ROW fan for many years, the cd is good,and should have been in the spotlight more.. the only thing that is missing is the voice of Bach..all the tracks on this cd are very well written and put together,but the remake of I REMEMBER YOU is was not LL that great.. evertime I listen to the cd, all I keep saying is that bach could have done better, the new signer has a good voice, but I think the band really tired to replace bach...(you know that can't happen)I am glade I got the cd, it is cool to jam to but I do wish Bach would come back......it is worth picking up..but just keep an open mind when you hear it......"
2,mediocre at best,"I got this cd for $3 so I wasn't too upset. There are a few tunes with potential. Hittin the wall- lamb- You can tell that they are really trying to rock, but it just doesn't come off. Some good beats, but the melody is blah! The mellow songs are just garbage, these guys have heard one too many Matchbox 20 tunes.Another tragic tale of how ego and pride can destroy a very talented band. Sorry guys. These guys were once way ahead of the group, now it all sounds like any local band in town. YUK"
1,Truly awful,All you have to do is listen to I Remember You Two. That says it all. Truly awful singing and lifeless guitar playing. Why would they even think of redoing this song with such a singer (if you can call him that)? This record has to be one of the worst ones I have ever purchased.
5,got to get...if as good as live,just saw skid row live in erie pa and i must say...not a single thing missing just a diffrent lead singer and i must say...as a old die hard fan...i am a new die hard fan too....new album they said to be released in fall with all new stuff
3,better than expected,"sebastian, cooome baaack!!!!! sollinger can't be compared to bach, he sounds like scott stapp of creed. but this record isn't bad. the more i listen to ""thickskin"" the more i like it. sabo and bolan didn't forget how to write energetic and catchy songs. there're are some bright points like ""hittin' the wall"", ""lamb"" or ""thick is the skin"". ballads are not very successful, but ""ghost"" is quite cute. ""born a beggar"" is also nice but it doesn't sound like skid row. so, i don't regret i bought this record, i'm not dissapointed, but it's still hard to accept for me that bach is not going to sing with skid row anymore:("
3,not bad,I like this Cd but think Sab's voice would have added to it and made it much better. He has much more vocal range.
2,Not that good,"To begin with, why did they do this re-make of I Remember You? I know why. This cd needs all the help it can get and it's NOT coming from this tune. Ruined it totally. The new vocalist is lousy. Has absolutely no vocal range. On a couple tunes, I thought he was trying to impersonate Dee Sniders Widowmaker type vocal style. By that, I mean an older Dee Snider. The musicianship isn't really to bad, which is why I rated this cd 2 stars. Otherwise, would've only gave it 1. This cd will not sell all that well even if radio picks up on it. The only reason this will sell at all is from past laurels."
3,"Good rock, but not the Skid Row of the 1980's","I saw Skid Row in concert in late May and they were awesome and I couldn't wait for the release of their new album Thickskin. After I finally got the album, I must say that I was slightly disappointed. Their sound would remind you of some of today's new rock and the last few tracks sound like they are from a strong punk influence. This is a solid album, but the change in material and the absence of Sebastian Bach (the original lead singer) were just not what I was hoping for."
1,A painful cd that doesn't even deserve 1 star,"I'm a huge fan of the old Skid Row. Skid Row isn't the same band without the voice of Sebastian Bach. After listening to Bach sing ""I Remember You"", it is painful for this second rate singer to try and sing such a great song. Especially since there isn't the emotion that is in Bach's voice. He sings so monotone that it is impossible to get into this CD.Stay away from this CD if you like The old Skid Row with Sebastian Bach."
5,New Generation... indeed!,"New guy on vocals? YES. Kinda modern sounding? SURE, but don't go crying ""sellout"". And they call themselves SKID ROW? YOU BETCHA!! This record kicks! Absolutely no filler here! It has not left the player since day one! If it didn't say ""Skid Row"" on the cover it would probably go platinum... it's THAT good! Really! This gives me relief that there still are true artists out there who can, and do, make great music. Every song is a hightlight... but the best (for me at least) are ""Ghost"", ""Born A Beggar"", ""Thick is the Skin"", ""Mouth of Voodoo"" and yes, the punky ""I Remember You Two"". Again, every single track is great. This is definitely in the top five rock releases of the year! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Oh... and go check 'em out live... yes, Johnny (the NEW voice of Skid Row) can belt out the classics too! Sebastian who?? Highly Recommended!!!"
3,Affordable but uncomfortable,"You get a lot of value for the money with this phone/answering machine combo, but I ended up returning mine for a refund. Here's why: the handset earpiece isn't shaped to fit my ear and I was always uncomfortable with this, plus there isn't a headset jack so you can't plug in a more comfortable headset. I ended up buying a model with a very similar look and feel from Radio Shack. Though it cost twice as much, the earpiece fits my ear and I can plug in a headset for longer calls."
1,No illustrations,Save your money. None of the nearly 900 illustrations from the original book are in the Kindle edition. I tried the sample and assumed they must be at the back of the book--not.
3,No diagrams,Book is great with detailed explanations but all refer to fig. for diagrams or illistrations of stitches. Unfortunately there are no illistrations in the kindle edition. My fault I should have read all te comments first.
1,WTF?!?,Lucky me! I apparently bought the edition that look like it was hand-typed with no illustrations. That'll teach me to read the fine print. DO NOT BUY! IT'S WORTHLESS!
2,Affordabe equals Cheap,"This book is not at all as advertised. It says it is high quality and affordable, but the only high quality part is the cover. The interior is all text, not one illustration and in a needlecraft book that makes it very difficult, (if not impossible), to use. If you are new to any type of needlecraft the book will not help you. I've been doing most needlecrafts for over 40 years and find the book difficult to use.The problem is in the way the book is formatted, they used generic computer text, which is large and takes up all the room, if they'd spent any time at all on choosing a correct and easier to read font they could have included the illustrations. It might have meant a slightly higher price, but it would have made it a useful book.This is the first book I've ever returned to Amazon.com, (in the 15 years I've been shopping here), but I will be returning it. I give it a D-."
3,Complete Encyclopedia Of Needlework: Anniversary Edition,"3.0 out of 5 stars Complete Encyclopedia Of Needlework: Anniversary Edition, June 21, 2009By Rachel M. Gregory ""Fashionista315"" (Brooklyn, NY) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)I bought this book because I was looking for a book that covers smocking and and other older hand stitching techniques. This was one of the few that I could look inside before buying which in retrospect was not too helpful but did make for a more comfortable buying experience at the time.This is a complete book of needle work but just like the other reviews have warned, the images are sometimes dark. Also, it's not a quick read/reference. It's an exact reissue of an earlier book and I think it would have been helpful to update the instruction style. It's a thick book and some of the stitching I will never use but the small section on smocking was helpful. So despite my negativity, if you are looking for a complete book of antique needlework, this may the one for you."
2,Disappointing,The book in entirely in black and white. Many of the diagrams are so dark and of such poor contrast that no detail can be discerned. The book has a wealth of detail but the illustrations are very disappointing.
1,No pictures!,The print version is a wealth of knowledge and techniques for someone who enjoys experimenting with needle work. I thought it would be fun to have a tablet version of this wonderful book but was disappointed to find it without any illustrations. Lack of illu's makes this a bore to read and super difficult to execute any of the stitches. Waste of time.
3,Definition without illustration,Not very helpful as far as instruction goes. Very wordy. It tells you of variations and definitions but does not do much for illustration
2,Did not like this book,"I'm new to chakra work. I have a few books on the subject and this one is by far the most confusing. I found it hard to read because of the terminology. If you are into Yoga then this book is for you. I am not, so it was very hard for me to follow."
4,A great self-development tool,"A great self-development tool. Wonderful workbook exercises, meditations and visualizations. I'm always looking for new ways to explore my own chakra system as well as assist my students in their own journey. This is one book I can pick up every now and then and see something new."
2,Looking For More,"""If I Were Your Woman"" was ok but to me but it left too many loose ends. I know this is a Romance Novel but it seemed more like Mystery Novel one would have to come to his/her own conclusion. Although it had a good plot there were too many characters to keep up with. I wanted to know what happened to Drake's Ex, Satin's Ex, Satin's Great Aunt's ex, and so on. If you want a book that touches and goes on topics very briefly, then this is the book for you."
3,Great Plot but...,I really enjoyed this book. I felt like there was a lot of lose end at the end of the book. Like what become of Troy? You mean his ex just gave up like that. Women of color is not that simple. I can't believe Drake's parents didn't have a few choice words. The Romance was there but then as soon as they started they were over. However the plot was good the charters were great but I think the book could have had a little more spice.
5,Very comfortable and great sound!,"You can't beat better headphones for $4. Seriously! Great sound isolation and great sound all around. I bought 2 pairs because I beat on them pretty hard. My originals still work, but I run a lot and there have been times when I have caught the cord on various things - branches, fingers, you name it....and yanked them out of my ears (ouch!) and I eventually created a tiny short in one of the wires due to the abuse. I love these and I want to make sure I have a couple of pairs for years to come! I have talked a few of my friends into trying these and they love them as well (and have bought a couple of pairs)!"
4,Jvc Marshmallows,"First off, I did the Kramer mod to these, so they are not stock. These are excellent 'phones for the price, and after the Kramer mod (google jvc marshmallow kramer mod) the bass is much more balanced with the mids and highs. The sound isolation is decent, especially with higher frequencies, such as keyboard typing. These do suffer, as do most cheap 'phones, from the stethoscope effect, as well as picking up sounds from an mp3 player. Bottom line, after the mod they are better balanced and have decent isolation, which is all I need for mowing, not great sound but excellent for the price."
1,ITEM NOT AS PICTURED,"FALSE ADVERTISING! The company sent me the WRONG PRODUCT! It was different than the one pictured on the site! The correct item code was originally written on the box but was apparently crossed off by the merchant and a new, incorrect code was written next to it. I called and nothing was resolved or refunded. TERRIBLE! BEWARE!!!"
5,Great Product!,This is my second set of these earphones. They are the best I've ever used...seriously. They are really good blocking out ambient noise...even airplane noise. They fit comfortably in the ears and stay put once in. I highly recommend this product.
4,"For the money, you're golden","They sound great, and they're comfortable. I have a similar pair that cost almost $100. They're brighter and more detailed, but they're also $80 more expensive and have little bass. At the end of the day... just buy these. I see myself using these more, oddly enough."
1,"Tinny sound, don't buy","These ear buds are trash, a waste of money. DO NOT BUY. If exercising, they will slip out of your ears once you begin to sweat. The sound is very tinny...a major downgrade from Apple earbuds."
3,Could be good but...,"The primary failing point of these earbuds is the fact that they do not stay in your ears. Even when I followed the instructions telling me to compress the foam and let it expand inside my ear, the buds did not stay firmly planted.The audio output of these earbuds could be decent, but to hear them at their best you have to constantly push them back inside your ears. Not an ideal listening experience, and thus, not an ideal product."
4,Comfortable with Pretty Good Sound,"These aren't Bose headphones, but priced at under $20, these headphones sound pretty good and are very comfortable. The only problem I have are replacing the cushioned tips. Because these are inner ear buds, they get dirty. JVC is the only place to buy replacement cushions and they are $2.50 per ear (plus $7 shipping on all orders), so it actually costs the same just to buy a new set of headphones. I hate wasting a perfectly good pair of headphones. Why JVC charges so much for a part that can't cost them more than a few pennies is beyond me. As much as I like my headphones, I'm actually debating not replacing them for that exact reason."
1,Sound Quality is AWFUL,Paid 24.99 for these headphones to (upgrade) from the ones that came with the MP3 player. Compaired to the ones that came with the device they were awful. The bass is scratchy. They are comfortable to the ear. But as for the sound. NOT GOOD. I boxed them right back up and took them back. Buy something else. Not worth the $$$
2,Very comfortable but.....,"These headphones are very comfortable, they almost feel like nothing is in your ear. The only problem is they sound horrible. There is no bass at all. It sounds like someone took a speaker out of one of my two year old's toys and stuck it in an earbud. I still use them but if you are looking for quality sound, look at something else or a newer model. I did notice the model number of mine isn't the same as the ones being sold in department stores. Maybe that's why I got mine for the price I did."
2,comfortable but weak bass,"These earphones are comfortable, but the bass is weak. Hardly any response below 64 Hertz. (Using the iTunes equalizer, changing the gain for 32 and 64 Hertz has very little noticeable effect.)In contrast, my Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia earphones are also comfortable, but perhaps have too *much* bass."
3,this is why you should spend more,"These earbuds are alright, but they aren't any better than the headphones i got with my iriver - the only advantage is that they block out sound. if i push them against my ear, they sound better, which leads me to believe that my ear canal is too small for the earbuds. my suggestion is that you should only buy an earbud if it's supplied with different sizes (e.g. sennheiser 300)."
3,Okay for the price,"I bought these for about 12 bucks and I wouldn't pay more than that for them. They're a step up from the standard iPhone buds which wouldn't stay in my ears, but if you're looking for quality then pay a little more for a better pair. The feedback is awful. Everytime the cord moves you hear it."
1,"Great Comfort, Poor Sound Quality","These are the most comfortable ear-bud headphones I've ever owned, but the sound quality is near the bottom of the scale. There is NO bass whatsoever, nor is there any depth in the sounds that it produces. I expected more for a $20 pair of headphones. These sound more like a $5 pair of headphones. There are better, much better, headphones at this price point."
1,Amazon sucks!,"After placing this order, which was clearly stated in-stock, Amazon actually never shipped it to me. They have the tracking number and everything, but when I called UPS, they said that Amazon never called them to pick-up the merchandize yet. I was told that Amazon wants to wait for the palette to be full before having shippping company picking the entire palette (?).Anyhow, this is the 2nd time this happened to me, and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened to other Amazon customers, too. More than 6 months ago, I ordered two T-mobile phones and had the same problem. In both times, when I called, all they can do is apologizing.I myself a long time customer of Amazon, but I've decided not to buy from this company anymore. There's nothing more frustrating than guessing when you would get the thinngs you've paid for.This company used to be my #1 choice, but it sucks big time nowadays. Beware when you order!"
4,A Tween granddaughter's delight!,"I looked for durability, color, and read reviews and ratings of this product before buying it, since grandmas don't always know if preteen granddaughters who are into the electronic age and live miles away would find our gift acceptable. However, our 11 yr. old granddaughter said the earphones were ""fantastic""! Her satisfaction says it all."
4,JVC Ear Buds,Product as described. Shipped quickly. I use these with my stereo system on my motorcycle. Product knocks out unwanted road and engin noise. Very comfortable. All in all a good product.
4,"very good for the price, if you like the fit","This is the only style of earbuds that will fit in my ear. Very comfortable, good (but not great) sound quality. I wear these when working out, and they never fall out and rarely need adjusting.Only problem: After 6 months, the original foam pads have hardened, and just this morning I replaced them with the second set that came with the earbuds. That's fine for now, but in 6 months I'll need another set of foam pads. Haven't been able to find any yet, although I could probably make some out of regular cheap foam earplugs.*Edit: I bought some foam earplugs, cut them in half, put a hole in them with a pen, and slipped them onto these earphones to replace the ones that they came with. Works great."
4,Great value earbuds!,"I purchased these earbuds because there wasn't much else in my price range at the store I purchased these at (big blue box store). However, I am very pleased with them. They fit very comfortably and do block a great deal of noise. I travel by subway a lot and I like to be able to listen to music without turning the volume all the way up, but I also like to be able to hear the announcements in case of an emergency. These were perfect!! I recommend these to anyone on a budget who needs some decent quality earbud headphones. I am not too critical about sound quality, so these may not fly those that are really concerned with quality or who want noise cancelling features."
3,not bad...could have been better,"I read this book and got only a few things out of it. I am not into Office Espionage but had it done to me. I have a lot to protect and when people started coming against me I needed an advantage, so I got this book. Not bad I must say. Some things I already knew while others made me take the time and try. This is a decent investment for only say 10 bucks. I was looking for more and got less. But I don't regret buying it. It is a little gem."
3,Good for a smile,"If you are shopping for a conspiracy theorist, than this is not the book for you.This is a light, fun book that is a quick and easy read. I bought as a gift for someone who loved James Bond-type stuff. He loved the book, and it was passed around the party and we all had a good giggle.There are a few creepy things in the book (like learning about how you can figure out someone's computer password), and it will likely make you a little more paranoid than you were before.Just don't buy this expecting to come away with super-spy type powers. It is more of a good stocking-stuffer/birthday type gift."
1,A Serious Waste of Money,"Here's a gem from page 13 on Discovering Computer Passwords: ""Secretly observe the person entering his password."" Yeah, thanks for that top-notch advice. The whole book's like that. In the chapter on Redconstructing Shredded Documents, they recommend ""Reconfigure the strips."" There is no bigger waste of money than this book."
4,Must have!,"I really enjoyed this one. Wayne has definitely honed his skills. The read was suspenseful and contained everything: humor, sarcasm, politics, and slapstick."
1,worst slippers ever- Made in China,"Both men's moc's came apart at the seams...same place on each one, and the fleece lining wore right through, all within 1 month. I've bought better slippers at Wal-mart for $10...and i paid the pre Christmas price of $50. The website represents them as quality American made but the tag says made in China."
3,PRODUCT QUALITY,The Men's Moc Slipper is OK but the sole comes off and I have had to gluethe sole back on 3 times in one year.Not the QUALITY you would expect for the PRICE!
2,Quality?,"As soon as I recieved and tried on my Staheekum slippers I notice that the wool on the sides seemed loose and when I wore them a flap of wool about2""1/2 long on the side came loose and fell out. Also there is an odor that becomes unpleasant after a while."
5,great slipper,I bought these slippers for my husband at christmas time. they arrived on time and in perfect condition. they are very warm and very well made. he loves them.
4,Slippers,"Before I got these slippers, I had a spot on my heel that felt like a corn. After wearing the slippers, which padded the sore spot, I no longer have it and can walk long distances in my outdoor shoes without difficulty."
2,indoor/outdoor house shoe?,"I don't know why or what they put such a heavy plastic sole on these for, unless they wanted to make them for indoor/outdoor use. Other wise they are nice and soft and warm inside. But that heavy plastic sole make them stiff and klunky to ware.I guess they are ok, but I won't buy another pair of them."
1,If you pay for cheap slippers that's what you get,Not Happy at all with these slippers. Do not buy them. They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot.
2,This rack is too narrow!,"The rack looks very nice and is well built; assembly is not difficult, but the rack is too narrow. I was planning to move some rack-mounted machines to this rack, but I was not able to install some of them. Maybe it's an issue with tolerances, but I have never run into a 'standard 19"" rack' that's so non-standard. I'd recommend going with a 44U rack from APC to avoid surprises."
4,It's a rack,"As noted in another review, use the supplied instructions to get started, but don't try to follow them exactly - just do what makes sense. Solid unit once assembled, sizes are accurate."
1,Do not buy! This rack will not fit servers with rails!,"Do not make the same mistake I did. This rack is not the correct width, none of my servers with Rails will fit correctly. I am now out several hundred dollars since my servers did not arrive in time for the return window.A correctly built rack should have a width of 17.75 inches. This rack is 17.5 inches."
3,Poor translation,"The negative nature of this review reflects upon this particular translation of Descartes' seminal work, not upon the content of the work itself. The edition in question (ISBN: 0330067739), published by Yale University Press and edited by David Weissman, utilizes a translation rendered originally for Cambridge University Press in 1911. Unfortunately, this translation does much to obfuscate a work that should help enlighten.The saving grace of this edition is that 3/4's of the book consists of nine separate essays, many of which are excellent, that review a broad spectrum of topics pertaining to Descartes and his ideas.I recommend that you buy this book for the excellent supplementary materials, but look elsewhere for a modern translation (i.e. the John Cottingham translation in the 'new' Cambridge Philosophy series)."
3,For Opera Lovers,"I was not expecting much, but I got more than I expected. Clearly Zefferelli wanted to film ""Carmen"" badly but never has a chance, so he made up the story and fimed ""Callas Forever"". It has everything for a nice evening with your TV - beautiful cinematography, excellent performances, terrific music... no catharsis though, but nevertheless it was worth buying. Oh, one stipulation - you have to ba an opera lover, otherwise it will be boring as hell. I am a huge opera lover, so I enjoyed it immensely."
3,Should Have Been a Biopic!,"Understandably, Franco Zeffirelli loved this woman, and wanted to show this affection on the screen. But the picture doesn't match the person.Maria Callas was a drawn, bitter woman at the end of her life, with a severe addiction to medications that would have made the premise of the film impossible. She is shown as a beautiful woman, and a caring woman, with a strong accent when she spoke English . . . Maria Callas was born in America and had no such accent, which took away from the fealty of the character.I would rather remember Callas as I saw her and heard her and read about her during her lifetime . . that is satisfaction enough for my memory of her. This picture would have been better as a biopic than as the practically complete fiction that it is."
1,"A disgraceful, muddled mess. . .","That a film ""about"" Callas starts with rock music should be your tip off. The gay sub plot has so little to do with Callas: although shewas surrounded by gays and adored by them, she was essentiallyconfused and irritated by homosexuality. Although Ardant is agood actress, and occasionally LOOKS like Callas, she never soundslike her. I'm not sure the technology ""used"" in the film to create""Callas Forever"" (the Carmen film) even existed in 1977: the whole concept is cartoon-ish andembarrassing to those of us who appreciated Callas for the supremeartist that she was. The money spent on this film would have beenbetter spent making an authentic film about Callas, or a definitivedocumentary. Zefferelli is a true genius of film and theater, butlike some other ghastly mistakes of his, this film is simply painful andembarrassing. All copies should be bought up and destroyed! Ardant may be forgiven for her noble attempt, but Ironsand Plowright should have known better."
3,Lana,"When I watched the movie in the movie theater originally few years ago, the sound was so perfect. The movie itself moved me so mainly because of the powerful sound. So, I purchased the DVD few years later because I could not forget the emotional effect this movie had on me. I was shocked to learn that the DVD sound track was awful. Somebody has to have absolutely no sense of music to make a DVD for production without checking the quality of the sound. For this movie it was a killer. I am so disappointed; I want to return this DVD."
4,great film,I love this movie. I would have given this move 5 stars but I had a problem with Fanny Ardant's accent. She sounded too French.
3,fantasy,"I like Maria Callas and find her life to be fascinating. The music in this film is good, after all, they used her voice. The actress who plays Callas gives a good impression of her. That's the good part.The story is fantasy. We don't know how much of it actually happened. The story is not compelling and an extraneous affair between one of Callas' business acquaintances and his young male companion add nothing to the story of Callas. Rent it if you want to hear Callas. Better yet, buy a CD of hers, that way you won't have the music interrupted by junk."
4,"Absolute cheese-fest, but lots of fun anyway","This movie is truly a guilty pleasure. The acting is top-notch and WAY over the top. Lots of high octane actors (Jeremy Irons, Fanny Ardant, Joan Plowright) chew the scenery like its celery. Campy fun and well assembled. An amusing bit of cinematic candy floss."
2,Don't use this,"Instead of using this, just buy Hagen Fluval Carbon 300G off Amazon and drop one in. You get three bags for the same price and its MUCH higher quality."
1,Buy The Hagen Fluval Carbon 300G (replacement) Bags,My 501 filter wasn't doing a good job with the Zoo Med Carbon Bag until I bought theHagen Fluval Carbon 300Gbags.BTW you get 3 bags of the Fluval compared to one from Zoo Med for the same (give or take a few cents) price!
3,careful analysis may not equal ground truth,"This book makes an interesting contrast to Robert Baer's ""See No Evil"". Careful analysis of mountains of facts versus the on-the-street experience of a seasoned case officer. My take is that if you got Pollack and Baer in a room together, they would agree in principle, but would end up in a brawl over the details. Try this book if you want a crash course on Iraq that is less boring than you'd expect. Try Baer's book to get a flavor for a grunt in the trenches of the spy wars. Try both to be even less clear on what to do about Iraq than ever--no matter what your political stripe."
4,Well documented arguement,"While you can agree or not with what Pollack has to say at the very least he gives you lots of information to base your decision on. I think if the government had given a more detailed argument for dethroning Saddam, like Pollack does, than much of the criticism they are getting now would have been headed off. The most striking points in the book are the poor policies enacted by the Reagan and Bush administrations of the 80's and early 90's. Bush now calls him ""evil"" but we knew Saddam was a madman then and still supported him."
4,Better than the title suggests,"This is a calm, lucid argument about the case for war against Iraq. Despite the flashy title, Pollack does not come across as a rabid war-monger. He musters his arguments and presents them in a dispassionate fashion. He makes a far better case than the Administration has offered."
2,Genuinely Poor Scholarship,"Six months later, not one drum of VX, not one vial of anthrax, not one nuclear weapon... Well Mr. Pollack, where are they?"
1,What Threatening Storm ?,"What a wonderful view into the pathetic rationalizations that helped trigger the deaths of thousands of innocent women and children. We can now give pause and take a deep introspective look into the mind set of America's 'true believers' knowing in retrospect that as a species mankind can be easily manipulated in mass to accomplish the insane biddings of a small group of impotent goons as it always has been. Whatever Mr. Pollack's true motivations were in writing this book he still bears the responsibility (along with his publisher) for empowering an obviously criminal administration in it's drive to war. It is pitiful to read his post invasion comments in the Atlantic Journal and painfull to think that approximately one American per day is still being killed in that ""threatening"" country! I hope Mr. Pollack reflects daily on the mass murder his propoganda has wrought."
1,Would anyone out there trust a book written by the CIA,"People please. War is a racket and most smart Americans know that.Saddam has never been a threat to the US. He's never worked with the CIA made Bin Ladin. He has no WMD.People. Wake up.First ther's this perpetual war on terrorism. Then you are told we must topple this evil government because of their WMD. Then when they find zero, notta, zilch, a whole number between -1 and 1, they change the story to one of liberating the people.Please. It's all lies. Go read Russ Kick's book ""your being lied to"""
2,Well-written but one-sided,"As a 15-year analyst on Iraq for the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council, Pollack gives an USA-friendly picture of the story. He does not mention the use of poisoned gas by Winston Churchill against the Kurds, nor the CIA-engineered coup that brought Saddam's Ba'ath party to power after the Iraq Petroleum Company was threatened by nationalization. Nor does he mention the chemical and military build-up of Iraq against Iran by the West, or the failure of the U.S. ambassador to warn against the invasion of Kuwait or, above all, the human costs of wars. For Pollack, there is now a ""window of opportunity created by the tragedy of September 11"".If you read this book, please also read more critical reviews such as the books by John Pilger or John Stockwell."
1,We reap what we sow - dare we harvest the violence?,"I have only one thing to say in response to this book, which is to quote Stephen Hawking as saying:""The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge"".If you insist on reading and taking this book to heart, then you are required also to read ""War Plan Iraq"" by Chomsky before you may consider yourself versed on the topic of Iraq. All ""The Threatening Storm"" will do is give you the rationalizations you need to agree with other conservatives. Using it to argue against truly informed opinion will only lead to your own public humiliation."
1,An awful written book. The case for executing Mr. Pollack,"If you think you can trust in what a CIA agent can tell you, then go ahead and read this nonsense. A spy is, by definition, someone who lies always to almost everybody. I think the CIA should give a medal to this guy. Well done, baby !"
5,An unbiased opinion regarding the case for invastion,"Pollack delivers a convincing case for invasion without bringing in partisan bias. Thouroughly researched, the book provides historical background and a complete discussion on the current political situation in the Middle East and Iraq. Pollack weighs various options and points out the advantages and disadvantages of each option. If you are looking for a book to help you understand the situation that the world is facing in Iraq, I would recommend this book without any reservations.***********************I wrote the above review before the war started. Now that it is practically over, I am amazed at how much Pollack was right on in his assessment. This book is still a must read if you want to understand the situation in Iraq and what the future might hold for the Middle East."
5,Informative and Superbly Written,"In this exceptionally well-written book, Kenneth Pollack clearly and concisely takes the reader through each of the options available to the U.S. during the lead-up to the war in Iraq. He explores the issues from multiple sides, addressing both the pros and cons of each available course of action (including the ""do nothing"" option). Ultimately he concludes that invasion is the ""least bad"" option, given the situation into which we'd let ourselves slide over a 12-year period. Whether or not you agree with his conclusion, you're sure to be impressed with Dr. Pollack's thought process, objectivity, and ability to communicate his reasoning.By the time I finished the book, I felt very well-informed on the issue of Iraq. I wouldn't have felt this way if it weren't for the objective, non-ideological nature of Dr. Pollack's analysis."
1,What Pollack should have learned in college and the CIA,"I borrowed this book from the library because it was suggested reading by Time magazine. Unfortunately, I find it hard to get past the first chapter. Pollack gives plenty of information about the history of the Persian Gulf region; none of which is backed by primary sources. These are basic rules to writing history..."
5,Perfect explanation for those who do not understand.,"Many Americans do not know that the US has been in Iraq for over ten years. It started when a US diplomat told Saddam, the US had no interest in his disputes with Kuwait. The rest is history but the world has forgotton it. This book outlines the case as to why the US military is in Iraq today. No conspiracy theories here, just the consequences of using half-way measures in dealing with a dicatator. The book is easy to read and avoids a lot of the technical words and jargon you would find in other books about the Middle East. Good for parents or college student or anyone who wants to know why the US is in Iraq today."
1,debunked,"I wonder how all these bobbing heads feel now that Pollack's vision has been debunked. There are no weapons of mass destruction. Saddam was never a threat to the United States. No nuclear sales or development took place. If any of this were true, the Bush administration would be crawling over themselves to justify themselves to a doubting public. This book should stay in print just to prove how swindled a ""democratic"" society can be by their leaders, who clearly have their own personal, financial agenda at stake."
1,Philips gives poor customer support!,"After we used and liked the phone for two weeks the handset developed severe static. When we contacted Philips' customer support they agreed it was a defective handset and gave us an address to which we could return the handset for repair or replacement. Our poatal service record of receipt indicates they received it on October 21, 2006. For more than two months we made numerous phone calls, spoke to many different persons, and were promised callbacks that never came. Finally a ""supervisor"" assured us that a handset was ""in the mail."" That was more than three weeks ago. We plan to keep trying to get some satisfaction, but meanwhile we have lost any shred of confidence we ever had in this manufacturer."
1,HORRIBLE,"Nothing is good about this - poor battery life, poor interface, i could never conf two handsets even after reading the manual 10 times, no phonebook sharing, 2 handsets went bad within 3 months and flash is not working anymore!! I hate it - am ready to throw it in garbage as soon i get my new set."
2,Stop working in a few weeks,I have this a gift to a friend in Atlanta. She just called me to tell me that it has stopped working over the 4-th of July weekend. It would have been nice if it had lasted a few months instead. I will have to find out how to get it repaired or replaced this week.
2,Philips Phone,The sound quality of this product is no where near what it was rated. The line is always full of static.
2,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT TO PURCHASE,"I brought one Dect2251g/37 with an extension handset. After charging the base handset for the initial 2 minutes, the AC power adapter blasted. It's good that I had installed one of those power trippers to save my life :).But overall, I won't recommend this product due to this kind of faulty piece i got."
3,basically o.k.,"Got the phone after seeing it in a store.Pros: looks, small footprint, easy to use.Cons: very small symbols on keys, display too thin and small with not enough characters,no date/ time for caller ID and messages.Conclusion: works fine for now, won't be my last phone of this kind, will probably get somethingmore substantial with better display and a little larger. This is like a mobile phone turneddesk top on a docking station.Update July 3, 08: Phone retired, no longer in use."
1,CHEAP,"Price reflects quality. Poor sound quality, NO features, not that easy to use. Don't waste your money"
3,A good book but...,A lot of good information and decent intro to techniques but I dropped a star because he claims to be running a Christian program in the book but got caught recruiting (cheating) a few years after this book came out. This best thing about this book is that it covers about EVERYTHING he does in running a top high school program. It's worth a read to anyone below the most elite highschool teams.
2,How to Be Rude,"That is essentially what this book teaches. If you were socially challenged before you read this book and actually inclined to follow the instructions, you'll soon wonder why random strangers and old friends alike seem to hate you. This book details perfect examples of most, if not all, unpleasant encounters I've observed with what I considered to be extremely rude individuals. However, that appears to be its rather well masked intention."
5,Such a fun book,"I loved this book. It made me laugh throughout and yet I feel like I really learned something. It's going to make a great gift for all of my friends, only some of whom need the advice."
5,funny and helpful!,"I love this book! Ms. Tiger's wit kept me reading and I picked up some helpful advice along the way. I've bought this book for friends and family alike, and everyone has loved it. It makes a wonderful gift, and because of the humor with which Ms. Tiger writes, no one is offended when they receive it."
2,Tragic,"Karen Matheson has without question one of the finest voices to ever utter a note. On the other hand, a great singer alone does not make a great, or in this case, even good album. With the exception of Morning, which is not that bad of a song, but still somewhat bland, the lyrics are just boring and the music being played to accompany the lyrics are nothing to get excited about either. One of the songs uses Robert Burns' writing as lyrics, but again the music just fails in every aspect.If you wish to see Matheson at her best, find her tracks that appear on almost every Secret Garden CD, or any Capercaille album, her voice is just beautiful. This, unfortunately is the complete opposite other end of the spectrum. I advise anyone but die hard fans to stay away."
3,A little too short,"I wish it were longer. It is beautiful and works well, but would be better if it were a few inches longer"
3,Okay but you can do better for less,The Cleret works okay but it isn't as good as the professional squeegee I used to use and it's more expensive. It is more aesthetic but I prefer that form follow function.
4,"Great looking, well performing squeegee",Soooo much better looking than standard squeegees! Works well. Tricky to find best way to store in shower but worth it!
2,Not Worth the Money,"It really does look good in the shower, but that is about it. It is difficult to hold comfortably...works mediocre at best....still squeaks, although not as much as most."
2,Small,Small squeegee and not very flexible. Unlike other squeegees i have used in the past this one is very hard to use.
4,Pretty Good...,"I bought for my parents and myself so we could listen to music and also listen to audio from the T.V. Unfortunatly I never got around to buying audio cables to hook up the stereo to the tv.The stereo does a good job of playing CDs; produces high quality stereo sound, though the CD scaner is very sensative in that scratches on a CD will upset the sound quality with anoying static pulses.The radio is the real disappointment with this product. If radio reception isn't great, the unit will often get confused and keep automatically switching between Stereo and mono sound playback. When reception is good enough for stereo, loud bass in music will upset the sound quality (only in radio mode).Over all, The Stereo system can be better, but it serves my purposes well enough."
1,Total piece of crap!,"I think the title says it all. So many problems from day one -- I have stood in front of this thing for 10 minutes trying to get it to read and play one freaking CD! Displays ""reading"" forever, then just stops, or doesn't read at all and doesn't play...invest in another $[...] and get yourself something decent. I will NEVER buy RCA again!"
1,"CD stuck inside, door won't open","The RCA RS2663 is nothing but trouble. It chews up tapes. Now the door won't open and 1 CD is inside. This happened before. I had to unplug and unscrew the panels, finally got the tray to slide out. I put it all back together again and it worked great for 1 day. The next day, the tray won't open again. I won't buy another RCA product again. Their engineering sucks. Also, the Bass Boost is too much but, without it, the sound is even worse."
1,bad bad bad,"This product was defective. It wouldn't play CDs. The manufacturer directed us to the seller, and the seller directed us to the manufacturer. We got no resolution, and are out the money we paid for this piece of garbage."
1,Worthless,I bought this piece of junk in early2008 and from day one the CD Player only played intermittently and now it don't play at all. I wrote to RCA and ask where I could get some support for this thing and naturally there was no response. This is the last item of RCA equipment I will purchase. It's nothing but junk.
4,so far so good,"It is a nice little system, I was looking for something nice and compact.Nice sound and everything works. I love that a 5 cd changer could be this compact. No complaints.."
2,Anecdotal Stories,"Unless you are totally ignorant of the various areas of the occult, this book will be of no real help to you. There is no Scriptural treatment of the subjects with little logical or critical assessments given of the areas either. The best the book has to offer is a lengthy list of anecdotal stories provided, ostensibly, as proof and/or examples - stories which, of course, cannot be checked out for accuracy or truthfulness. I was hoping the book could be used as a reference. I was wrong."
2,Buyer beware,"This is the only book I have ever given a bad rating. This book not only has useless information on the occult but has a negative and unappealing tone throughout the reading. Although I can agree to disagree with some of the thing he states about the Charasmatic movement, this book is poorly organized and is a hard real. Buyer beware!"
5,Show Biz Kidz,"I am a Steely Dan fanatic. Years ago I bought this album in vinyl. Rather than take the time, money and effort to convert my vinyl to Hi Def quality I decided to purchase. Since today you can buy a single track for .99 rather than an entire album it seemed a no brainer. Then I discovered these older albums sell for considerable less new today than they did new yesterday. So there's the story. I now have my most favorite Steely Dan tracks in Hi Def for less than I paid years ago. Ain't America great?"
5,Fantastic,ROC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle night cream is fantastic stuff. My crows feet are barely visable.
1,Will not play in Blu Ray players in the USA,I have recieved three discs so far and none of them play in my Sony BD player. USA zone code.
3,OK fan,"I bought 2 of these and expected them to be quiet but I am dissapointed with the high speed, its loud. I put one in my kid's room to help circulate the air but the fan's high speed is loud and it scares my 3 years old son. The mid speed noise is ok but does not blow. One of the fan has a clicking sound during the oscillation, the other is not."
2,Loud!,"I just bought this fan and it is too loud! Even on its lowest setting, the noise is a bit much. It does put out a stiff breeze, but I'm not sure it's worth it. My Black and Decker tower fan is better."
2,Not worth the money,"I ordered this product hoping it was the same as the product I was using. The picture that was shown was the exact product that I had at home but when the order arrived it was the ""new, improved"" product with completely different ingredients. This new product does not work as well as the old one. If they would have changed the picture from the purple bottle to the cream colored one, then I would have known that the product had changed. Even the name is different.Since ordering the above hair product I have tried ""Bouncy Cream"" by Iso. It is a wonderful product and so much better than this one from Silky, Sexy Hair."
2,"pretty run of the mill, but solid","This isn't a bad collection of standards. It's not really that adventurous but it's a good starting point. There are a few dud ideas in there but a few good ones (I got it bad and that aint good is a winner). So I can't say I'd buy it again, there's better around."
5,Bellydance Show Basics,"Tanna does a great job of instructing you through a Basic Show. She changes costumes often - fun to see! She goes thru a makeup session that was very helpful.Although I do not consider myself a beginner, it was nice to see how manage a show with a low amount of stress and yet fun and exciting! This was a good purchase!"
3,Hard to hang up!,"The phone has a large button to answer calls but to hang up you have to find a second, tiny button- I found it difficult and replaced the phone with a different phone after using it for about a month. I gave this phone to my parents who, just like me, disliked the hang up button and have stuck it back in the box. Just need to write up that ebay listing... The rest of the features are good and easy to use. It's a poor design element (just my opinion) that rendered the phone to garage sale status."
4,"Good, reliable system","Although several other reviewers have complained about static or poor voice quality, this phone system has been great for us. Never a problem, easy to set up and use, clear voice quality and very reliable. Uniden has been my brand of choice for years. The only reason for giving this phone 4 instead of 5 stars-- the fact that you can't use the two handsets at the same time. The other day I was on the phone and I started getting a low battery warning beep from the handset I was using. I went to switch over to the other one, and discovered I couldn't. I had to hang up and call the person back from the other handset. Not exactly convenient, but not a dealbreaker for me either."
1,dead in 14 months,"One of the handsets lost its ability to transmit, just after the warranty expired.But wait, there's more:These two handsets do NOT share phonebook information -- if you plan to store telephone numbers for easy dialing, you'll have to enter them twice. There's no way to beam phonebooks from one to the other, like some Siemens phones do.We tried one third-party headset, and it did not work well. We bought the Uniden HS910 Headset (an additional $20) and it is only barely adequate; both its speaker and microphone produce substandard sound.All in all we've been underwhelmed with this unit, and we're looking to replace it even though we've only owned it for 14 months."
4,Almost Perfect,"I have had this phone for a year, and I can say it's almost perfect. I have had perfect clarity, and I live in a 3 level house and use 802.11 wireless networking (netgear base and cisco cards).Pros-Digital Answering machine, Headset jack, rocket dial+++, different rings for each caller id (need id though), message waiting on handset, crystal clear (see my exceptions), two headsetsCons-Address books are not shared (each entry twice stinks), the battery life is short and no extended available, and if the other side disconnects and you don't, holds the line up.On my reception/buzz problem, I had direct tivo installed with the phone to check before dialing..sounds like static...only heard on the cordless...not my landline...Overall 4 Stars"
5,A talkers haven,"I talk a lot, and I prefer cordless phones. I purchased this particular model because it offered 2 phones, with 2 seperated bases at a reasonable price, and I am still completely satisfied with my decision! If the phone rings for someone else all you have to do is transfer the call, no more yelling or walking the phone to them, this phone adds a lot of convenience to your day! I love them!"
3,"Great concept, but one problem....","I purchased the 900MHz version of this phone and was excited to set it up as soon as I got home. One problem, however..... You can't use both extensions at once -i.e. more than one person cannot talk on the phone at the same time. This was a huge downfall for us because our kids love to get on the phone at the same time we are to talk long-distance to family members. You can only transfer a call from one extension to another. Unfortunately, I had to return the phone system and buy two separate phones....a cordless phone answering machine for downstairs and a separate cordless phone for upstairs. Great concept with a lot of great features, but one BIG downfall. Try again Uniden!"
1,Floperoo,Second phone never worked. Quality of speakerphone was abysmal. We gave up on it and bought a different phone. Save the money
4,Uniden Dual Handset Phones,"Why would anyone think that two people in the same household can talk at the same time on phone(s) associated with one phone number? There are not two lines! The second handset is just for convenience, say, in another room. I am investigating these phones before I buy, and this one seems pretty worthwhile. Right now we have a cordless downstairs, and 3 other cordlesses in bedrooms, and they tend to interfere with each other being so close together. That is why I want this type of system - the dual handsets with add-on capabilities. Anyway, it seems like a good bargain for the money - 2 handsets, caller ID and an answering system! I am just not sure - they have 5.8 Gig systems out now. The 2.4 G we have now has reception problems sometimes....not sure if it's the brand (V Tech) or our area."
2,"Good for the money, but you get what you pay for...","Pros:-Easy to set up and use.-Good quality construction-Charges quickly-Second handset is a ""nice to have""Cons:-Voice quality is terrible if you are out of line of sight of the antenna in another room. Sounds more like a cell phone than a land line."
1,THIS PHONE STINKS. PERIOD.,"While I have enjoyed a [money amount]Uniden cordless for two years, I cannot believe they let this particular model out of development and into production. The sound quality, ESPECIALLY to those on the other line, is simply unforgivable. Static, distant and just terrible. I like the functions, price and even the look, but without good sound quality, what good is everything else?Last word: I don't understand how others writing good reviews haven't had the same experience. Weird thing is: after telling my friend about my phone, he told me he had the same one and ended up returning it for the same reason. So, I KNOW the sound is not because of where I live / localized interference.Keep looking."
2,Sound quality problems,I seem to be the only one with this problem but I had to return my phone due to poor sound quality. Handset #1 echoed badly on my end and the people I talked to told me that I sounded far away or muffled. Handset #2 was better but there was still some echoing on my end. I liked all the features of the phone and was very disappointed that the sound was a problem.
2,terrible sound quality,"like many of the other buyers, i ignored warnings and purchased this phone anyway because it had so many features. bad idea. the sound quality is terrible. people constantly told me that they couldn't hear me, i heard a hissing in the background and i had difficulty hearing people as well. i bought this phone about 4 months ago and initially it was fine. i especially like the second handset but at this point, i'm still looking for a good quality cordless phone. i don't ask for much. just want good sound quality. if anyone has any suggestions.... i would not recommend this phone. oftentimes, i had to call people back on my cell phone because this phone was so unclear."
5,Its Great,"I have used many cordless phones in the past and have abandoned them for this reason or that. The clarity on this phone is amazing and the range is also outstanding. I believe the issue about not being able to use both handsets simultaneously has to do with security issues, so I am fine with it. The features are good and for the price I paid, it can't be beat. A paging/intercom system would have been nice, but hey I use my phone to talk with people at the other end of the line, not on the same one. I like this phone and highly recommend it."
3,"Great product, bad price","I bought the same phone at Sam's Club for $50. It's been great, no problems, super easy to use! Just don't byu it here, it's a rip-off!!!"
2,They Call This A Phone???,Not the phone for me. Some phones are designed to last only through the end of the month. Bang and Olufsen phones are far superior.
4,EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE VS COST,I ordered 20 or so of the TRU-448 for use around the office. I have had nothing but positive feedback from all the users that this model was issued to. I also purchased a set for use at home. It has been over two years and aside from our pet rabbit chewing through the power cord for the remote unit we haven't had any issues whatsoever. The range and reception around home is outstanding and the battery life is much better than expected after 2 years of use.
2,Disapointing,Complicated to usePoor sound qualityUnable program correct day timespare handset goes dead after 2 minutesjust not user friendly
1,Average phone with the perks of a $15.00 phone,"DO NOT spend your hard earned money on this average phone. What you get from this phone and answering system, you could get investing in a $20.00 system! The phone reception is terrible . . . don't expect to have the TV on and be able to hear when talking on the phone. And the answering system . . . .HORRIBLE. We have set the ringer to pick up after 4 rings and it ALWAYS picks up after 2 rings. Messages left on the system are ALWAYS cut off; rather the message is 5 seconds are 20 seconds.NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
2,Taking back today,"I purchased this phone because of all the features. They all work very well, except two. First, there is a terrible 'echo effect'. It sounds to me like I'm in a tunnel. The person on the other end says the same thing. I found the further you get away from the base unit the less this happens. So, if you can handle having the base, which has the answering machine, in your bedroom, while all the phones are in other rooms, it might be okay.The other problem is the wall mounting. Yes, the base is wallmountable, however, the phone does not stay on the base. I have had other systems that it works, but not with this one.So, this one gets a 2 star. Most important to me is sound quality and it fails."
4,Exceptional Phone,"I had been searching for a 2.4GHZ phone, with integrated answering machine, for the last month and have researched all of them. I've owned Sony's, Panasonic's, V-Tech's, AT&T's, etc, and I was never too pleased with the sound quality of these products. After reading some comparisons, and checking with Consumer Reports, I decided to purchase the Uniden TRU-448-2. The sound quality is great. The set-up process is simple, and the owners manual is very in-depth. I would have given this phone 5 stars, but it's limited expandibility held me back. Overall this is a great phone."
2,"Good, but quirky software","Reception is fine and the double handsets is the major reason I purchased this set for my parents. However, the speed dial and call end buttons are difficult to use and the backlit display is hard to read for those without exceptional eye-sight.Annoyances:- Most cordless phones have one button for both TALK and END. However, this Uniden model has *two* and the END button is about 1/6th the size of the TALK button.- Display hard to read for those with less than stellar vision.- Speed dial is not as simple as hitting a dial button then the number. It's some convoluted set of directions before you can get it to dial.- While the phone is ringing on the base set, if you pick it up, it will not automatically answer. You must also hit the talk button.- Interference with my wireless PC network (all 2.4GHz do though)Positives:- Decent reception- Dual handsets- NiMH battery"
3,Can't use both handsets at once!,"Great sound quality. Good Range. Good answering machine. No problems except for 2 big ones. This, as other 2.4g phones will interfere with wireless networking. If you keep changing the channel on the phone though you can get them to not interefere. But the BIG one is that you can't use both of the handsets at the same time. only one at a time. FYI - I think that greatly reduces the usability of the phones. Otherwise it's good."
2,Taking it back,"To me reception is all important. That is why I am taking this one back today. I really liked all the features, but I get an echo when I talk. The person on the other end says it sounds like I'm in a tunnel. I found that the further I got away from the base unit, the less 'tunnel effect' there was. If you can have the base unit (with answering machine) several rooms away or you talk outside alot, it's great."
4,surprise from the past,"Bought this for the cover of ""July you're a woman"".....A song from my not-so-recent past which I couldn't find on any John Stewart material. Other stuff was pleasant and quite a sleeper for me. The cover song was fabuloso and worth the price of admission!! Thanks for bringing back such a great song."
1,Not great.,"The weight of the sweatshirt that I received was about two sizes smaller than it should have been, and was around the same quality as a Jersey's from kmart. Save your money or get a carhartt from here, for roughly the same price. That's what I did."
3,good product,"These are really good for loafers or other slip on shoes that have more coverage in the upper foot area and on the sides of the shoe. They are not as great for shoes like ballet flats, where they show more."
4,talmud review,"Book is very interesting, at the beginning is a little boring but then has the good stuff. Good for college or seminary reading."
4,"good, readable intro survey to the Talmud","I really enjoyed the first 2 sections of this book. Interesting history of the Talmud and the reasons why the tome evolved the way it did. Then led to good surveys of how the Talmud addresses issues, both religious and (for me, at least) non-religious. My interest started to wane in the 3rd and final section, but perhaps that's a reflection on this reader and not on all readers. Overall, a good intro to an enchanting subject. I'm on to Everyman's Talmud by A. Cohen as a next step."
3,"Accurate and useful but at times ""overcrowded"" information","This book is good and useful for a beginner to understand the context and the structure of the Talmud. A limit, though, of this book is that too much information is given in a short tractation, thus sometimes it results in pages of bits of notions which the reader is unlikely to retain."
3,Title Required,"A bit tedious, but none-the-less interesting. Title & 13 more words required. Title & 13 more words required. Title & more more more words needed."
2,Needs better packaging,"As shown in Amazon's illustration, the 10 reams of paper are in a Hammermill cardboard box. I've received shipments of similar boxes that came through in good shape. However, as Amazon shipped the product, the 10 reams of paper were put in a box somewhat larger than necessary to hold them, and the remaining space was partially filled with airbags.When I received the package, all the airbags had collapsed, and all of the reams were broken open. Some of the paper was wrinkled enough to make printer feeding problematical.The solution is to ship the product in Hammermill's outer box, and package that in one of Amazon's cardboard boxes."
3,"A ""Regular People Review""","Really this is a good source if your looking to start a collection as a newcomer. If your just looking to expand your exposure to different works already having a grasp of classical music in general, the Goulding book may suit you better. Hope this helps."
4,"Very helpful, but stops with Leonard Bernstein","I got this book in 2003, and it has been indispensable. I've been going through the music in a more or less chronological order, and am now getting into the 20th century. It stops with music by Benjamin Britten and Leonard Bernstein though, which leads me to wonder if NPR will put out a book of essential modern classical music. I know of a few composers like John Cage, Steve Reich, Gavin Bryars, and Henryk Gorecki, but not much more. Something covering some of the best film scores would be nice, too."
5,"Informative, fun, indispensible","Anyone who loves classical music should have this book on their shelf. Often, there are composers I enjoy, or pieces I want, but I have no idea where to begin. There is an endless supply of titles in today's classical music market, especially for major works. This book is a good place to begin. Limiting itself to 300 works, it is able to give a good amount of information on the piece and the recordings it recommends. While you may not agree with Libbey's choices, at least you'll know what to expect when you encounter them."
3,Useful but bit old,"I have a difficult time finding the CDs mentioned in this book, and especially ones performed by specific orchestras. I've searched both online and music stores, but almost 90% of the items described in the book cannot be found since they're no longer being manufactured by companies. It's still nice to know the names of these composers and some background history. Another thing is that they should include pronounciation keys after each mentioned composer, artist, place names, and musical terms. Do you want to sound like an idiot talking to people?"
5,Enjoyable Listening,"Unfortunately I have not experienced Winston in concert, but I have most of his CD's. Plains is great for the pure listening enjoyment of Winston's style and technique."
2,Not at all satisfying mere salon music..this isn't Winston.,"Strange, but those who like ""Forest"" don't seem to enjoy this album too much--including myself. I completely agree with everything that was said in Bryan Douglas's review. It is overall a nice set of easy-listening tunes, but all of these pieces presented here could be performed by any other pianist of this genre and I wouldn't be able to find any difference. The extra tracks do not contribute too much either, I don't see a reason for anyone to get this ""limited edition"" instead of the plain version.I'm not saying that this album is not worth at all; it could be a very soothing, relaxing album to some people that simply enjoy those qualities of the music. If you were shocked and disappointed by the previous ""Forest"", then you may find this compensatory. However, this is not at all of the same class as other albums by Winston, which are true classics."
4,"Good album, but has a different feel to it than say ""Forest"" or ""December""","Any George Winston is good stuff. Some releases tho, are better than others. While ""Plains"" is very good, it doesn't effect me like 1982's ""December"" or 1994's ""Forest"". As for the individual songs... there is no ""Carol Of The Bells"", ""Thanksgiving"" (both from ""December""), ""Tramarack Pines"" or ""Cloudy This Morning"" (both from ""Forest"") here. There are however some classic Winston-esque tracks here. Check out ""Rainsong"", ""Cloudburst"", ""Before Barbed Wire"". While Winston is able to pick and choose his 'cover' tunes, I feel his choices on ""Plains"" could have been better. Sarah McLachlan's ""Angel"" just doesn't work for me here. Winston plays the Cahn & Atkins tunes well, but his own new age stuff is easily the best. Track 9 (""Merry Go Round"") should have been deleted. The majority of this album flows - and depending on where you are... it will give you the opportunity to experience some of those deep thoughts."
4,More enjoyable with each listening,"The first time through the album, I wasn't sure want to make of it. But each time I played it, I found myself appreciating more and more the artisty Winston brought to these selections. It should be noted that only one of the songs is an original composition, which was quite a surprise. Still the songs are enjoyable. Particuliar favorites are the opening ""Dubque"" and ""The Dance"" which I keep listening to over and over again. I would love to have his arrangements on sheetmusic, because many of them sound like they be great fun to play. This will not be remembered as one of his greatest works, if for no other reason then they aren't his compositions and there is nothing terrible originial in his interpretations. Still for fans of melodic piano music, and all Winston fans it it well worth owning."
5,"Absolutely Incredibly Soul-Touching ""All That""!","I'm just a little soapmaker in the ""Plains"" of the midwest, who just happens to absolutely love George Winston. This CD reminds me of the way I used to feel back in the early 80's when I first heard(over and over and over and over) ""Autumn"". This beautiful collection of medleys is having that same wonderful effect on me. Pure magical enjoyment!"
3,"Plain, jazzy, but where's the trance","I love George Winston's work. Unlike 90% of my music, the timeless quality is there. In ""Plains"", both ""Give me Your Hand"" and ""Cloudburst"" have his trademark foreground/ background work, in which the music exudes a power, an energy I've come to love. Like the Koln Concerts by Keith Jarrett, there's a flow.Yet, most tracks are searching, not quite evolving into an attractive work so freely available in Winston's seasons. Jazzy, yes. Clean, yes. Magic, well, no."
3,Rebuke for Barry Wilson,"I would like to ask Mr. Wilson a question: What is your point? Certainly it's your perogative not to like or enjoy a piece of music, but to completely trash an artist is ungracious and in poor taste, to say the least. I have not listened to this C.D. (hence the three stars) but being familiar with George Winston's music, I just can't imagine it being as horrid as you say it is. In my very humble opinion, you should quit the negativity--it's unbecoming--and try some positive energy. If you have ever done anything creative then possibly you have the right to be critical; but, if not, then refrain from nasty comments and actions. This world is too full of people like you and your friends. Try being nice for a change."
4,Another GW gem,"I really enjoyed George's latest. I found 'Forest' rather uneven (yet cool) - this one seems to flow well with a nice variety of compositions. I would put it up there with his best, although I hope he gets back to writing some originals soon!One must hand it to GW to pave the way for 'new age' pianists (eg Aaberg, Lanz, Brickman). I think some of the other negative reviews seemed strange to me - just simply 'Winston haters' - OK, you made your point - now go to a newgroup or grow up!"
1,I HATE THIS MUSIC!,Winston really smells up the room on this one. I can't believe reviewers like Barry Wilson giving this a GOOD review after all he has said in the past about Winston. THIS IS GARBAGE!
1,WINDHAM HELL!,"As always, the talentless Winston comes through with yet another artificial solo piano bore. My suggestion? Get yourself up into the mountains...far far away from Winston's ""Plains""!"
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!,Winston really stinks. This is his worst album yet. Stay away at all costs!
4,"Great product, slightly expensive.","As somebody who has had serious confident problems, this was light in the dark. Although it smells a little bit funny at first, it did a great job of flattening my chest, which is a serious confidence booster. It's a little tricky to get on at first, but it's doable; the best part is that it doesn't constrict breathing. It's a bit pricey, but I'd definitely recommend it."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Basically, the garment is a thick mass of rubber. As you might expect, it's real trouble to put it on, you'll sweat like a pig wearing it, and (because of the sweating) it's almost impossible to take off. Don't waste your money."
3,Lots of Fun! Not Bad.,"This album is lots of fun for little ones and better than most (mindless) children's music out there. And yes they wiggle. But still it is a little commercial, and I don't think you can really call them true children's musicians like Raffi.I strongly recommend you check out Raffi's music, such as ""The Singable Songs Collection"". Raffi has sold 13 million albums, millions of videos, a million books, and is considered the Mr. Rogers of children's music."
5,Never heard of them!,"I had not heard of the Wiggles until we received this CD as a gift. We played the CD during a visit by a friend with a 16-month old daughter, and although they hadn't been familiar with the Wiggles either, the daughter immediately started to dance to the music. As best I can tell, our baby likes it too. (He's only 8 weeks old. If our playing it doesn't make him cry, that counts as liking it.)The songs are catchy... I find myself humming or singing them pretty often. And there is an intersting mix of music: some Wiggles's originals and some Australian traditional.We're enjoying the CD so much that I've been looking for Wiggles CDs at our public library, and was very disappointed to find that they don't have any! So, we'll just have to buy them."
5,~Groovy....groovy.....groovy!,"My 2 1/2 year old absolutely looves these guys! Right now we are listening to the ""Yummy, Yummy"" cd for the second time in a row after listening to ""Let's Wiggle"" three times in a row!! He sings, jams, and dances along and after six weeks of this I'm buying more Wiggles because I do start to tire of the cd's after the third time in a row. All in all...the Wiggle's definately rock for the preschooler/toddler set!"
5,Who Doesn't Love The Wiggles???,My niece loves the Wiggles (so does our entire family!) This is a great array of Wiggles songs and a great gift for the little Wiggle-lover in your life.
5,You can't help but to dance to it.,"My friends told me about the Wiggles at one of my daughters play groups. They said ""Your daughter is going to love it more than Blues Clues."" Knowing that my daughter is a fan of Blues Clues I didn't believe it but, I gave it a try anyway. So I come home with ""The Wiggles "" she saw the movie and seemed to like it a lot. Then a couple of days later after she had been watching the Wiggles for a while I asked her ""So, what do you want to see today Blue's or The Wiggles."" and without any hesitation she said the Wiggles. I really like this movie because my daughter gets up and dances and that's exercise."
5,Kids and adults alike love this title.,"We listen to this CD every time we get in the car (along with all their other titles) and the tunes never get old. My almost 4 yr old daughter knows all the words now and that only adds to all of our enjoyment as we now turn the volume down and listen to her sweet little voice singing along. I highly recommend this (and all the other cd's) as a must-have to all parents of this age group - especially if you're like me and can't get the last song you hear in the car out of your head the whole day...these songs are catchy and enjoyable. You will want the videos for all of the cd's because the kids learn a lot of neat dances and get lots of exercise while wiggling along (parents, too - who needs aerobics!)."
3,MANY SONGS...SOME BETTER THAN OTHERS,"There are quite a few songs on this CD. The beginning of the CD is better than the end. I usually skip the end songs, as neither my kids nor I like them. My kids (ages 2 and 3) like the CD, but it's not one of their favorite children's CD."
3,very pleased despite..,"This is a great cd despite the fact that it has several boring slow songs that my toddler wasn't enjoying. We enjoyed the upbeat, dancing tunes, but we just forwarded the boring slow songs.I recommend listening to the songs first then purchase it if you like."
1,Big Mistake!,"From the time that we bought this phone, we have had problems. Our phone does not always hang up the connection when ending the call. The phone connection will stay open leading us to unplug the phone line and reconnecting. This occurs whenever we use the phone - making a call or checking our messages. Also, when we moved, our message light indicator quit working. It just started working again this week and now the light will not stop blinking even after we have cleared our messages. Nothing but problems! We should have returned it early on."
4,One o the best!!,"I love this lip balm. When you put it on, your lips actually tingle!! Very kewl! Also, for kissing and stuff, it's better to have a balm than a gloss or lipstick. It leaves your lips soft and hydrated and TIMGLY!! very cool, even guys will like it"
5,The Leadership Bible,"Taking Care of the BasicsThe Leadership Bible published by Zondervan is one of the most practical tools for applying biblical principles in the work place that I've ever seen. For the person who is serious about developing their leadership skills according to biblical insights and principles, this is the book. The organization of the book makes it easy to study the 52 topics over the course of a year by studying one per week. Then, the topics are also arranged to allow the reader to quickly find a specific issue or concern and study the passages related to it. With the daily study format and the insights of so many contributors, this is an essential for anyone who really wants to learn what the bible says about leadership."
1,Disappointing At Best,"This book lacks the well written literary structure of the original series and the illustrations are terrible. On top of that, the seals are in an unrealistic and old-fashioned entertainment centered ""show"". They should have been more biologically accurate and eco-friendly. I can accept that our favorite little monkey does all the unrealistic things that he does, but seals can't really jump and flip as depicted - that just bothers me,I love Curious George so much and am so pleased that my 2.5 year old is now enjoying it too. He also loves going to the aquarium and is facinated by sea life; I THOUGHT this would be the perfect book."
2,defective LCD displays,"I recently purchased the Audiovox FPE1080 and found out of the box that one of the pixels was always on solid green. I returned the unit for another and on powering this unit on, a pixel was stuck on solid red. The LCD displays are defective in these units. I returned the unit for another make. If your looking for quality or quality control from this unit, look somewhere else."
4,Great little tool,"This item was bought to save my fingers when mincing small herbs such as garlic,parsley and the like. It has been great except I have to get used to CAREFULLY pushing a few pieces that stick to the blades on the inside between the two. Other than that this is definately worth the money."
3,"Looks good, but doesn't take good pictures","CONS: No optical zoom, odd picture color, long flash delay, no action shotsPROS: Big display, cool silicone cover, CHEAPI got this camera two years ago on a Black Friday sale at Circuit City for around $80, then paid $10 for a 1GB SD chip from a 4 pack.Anytime I was in the picture I had a yellow tint, my girlfriend looked red. There is no setting for action shots. You have to be a couple feet away from an object if you don't want the flash to wash the image out. The only thing this camera would be good for is a young child's first camera to take still pictures. This held me off for a couple years, but I never used it because the pictures were horrible. I am much happier now with my Olympus Stylus 840."
2,Quality does not match price,"I'm no photographer, but the ""light level"" was poor. Unless there was really bright light, I could hardly see the image on the screen. If I took a picture, the flash would go off, but then the image was horribly washed out.The camera also had a ""plastic-y"" feel. A couple times, I couldn't even get the camera to turn on. I suppose this was because I didn't finesse the button just the right way. ...not something I want to deal with.I retuned the camera and got a Nikon. It was $20 more, but I got the quality I paid for."
2,CHRISTY,"I bought this camera for my daughter for a Christmas gift. I did the research and for the price (at the time)this seemed to be a good camera. I thought it might be a good starter camera. Unfortunatley, the camera really does take horrible pictures. Any pictures taken inside, you're not able to see. It looks like they were taken outside at night. Even when there is plenty of sunlight, there seems to be issues with the picture quality. They almost look grainy. Also, we seem to have a problem with the off/on button. The camera gets turned on easily without you knowing and then your batteries are run down. I would shop around before buying this Polaroid."
3,Good camera for a child or beginner,I bought this for my seven year old son last Christmas because he loves to take pictures. It is a good camera for a child or beginner. The picture quality is not the best and the batteries do not last long at all. We purchased rechargeable batteries to save money. My son loves it and loves using the recorder it has.
4,Intermediate Accounting,"I was struggling (what I call struggling) in the class until I bought this book along with Volume II. I found that it helped me immensely. Though my instructor is good, she goes through things a lot faster than I was able to take notes for. This book was definately beneficial for keeping my GPA!!!"
4,Great Accounting companion,"This book is a great companion to the Textbook Intermediate Accounting by Donald E. Kieso, and Jerry Weygandt. Helpful to the serious accounting student in identifying their mistakes and correcting them. Aids the student in the correct formatting for this course. This should be used only after the problems have been worked out as a check."
1,Returned Book no answer.,I returned this book and I did not receive an answer or refund they kept my money.
3,Runs out of fuel very quickly,"This is a really neat product and got it in part for the ""cool"" factor which it fulfills very well. It is also sturdy and easy to disassemble.It is almost painful how often I have to refill it even though I don't use it very often.Overall it is a good product but I may end up selling it in leu of disposable lighters."
5,a beautiful ting,"I wanted a windproof lighter so Zippo sprang to mind. Trying to light up on the golf course can be a pain with a disposable, besides I hate the idea of a ""disposable"" lighter, they're expensive junk.But Zippo's are still made in the USA of high quality materials and you can actually light something in the wind with one.Anyway the brass ""armored"" is way cool, a little heavier and very handsome.BTW the on-line price was way better than anything I could find locally."
2,Zippo Armor High Polish Brass Pocket Lighter,"As most thinks that are made now, this Armor Lighter does not have the same heft and feel as just the ordinary lighter from the past."
5,Love it!,"I love this zippo! Its a definite step up from a regular zippo, you can feel the difference. When will they fix the loose hinge though? There is always wobble, but it doesn't effect the overall fit. I would still highly recommend!"
5,Zippo Brass lighter,"Works very well, high quality. Only problem is coworkers trying to walk off with it because it works so well!!"
5,"made in USA, heavy brass, Zippo.. sold.","This American legend is even better in the heavy duty (50% thicker) 'armor' version. This is my EDC. If I don't lose it, it will certainly survive to be passed down to my (future!) kid some day.I don't smoke, but I use fire for finishing 550 cord, lighting stoves/lanterns, loose threads, etc..Fire is one of the 10 essentials. Carry it. And keep one of the Zippo fuel fobs handy. Or, keep your zippo in a tiny ziplock to essentially stop evaporation of the fuel."
4,sturdy,this is a more heavy duty lighter than the standard zippo the brass is nice and shiny but tarnishes fast and scratches easy.
5,Good and Strong,"Case is good and thick. Good price at 20 bucks, too. This is going to be a lighter that lasts a VERY long time."
4,it's a zippo,"perfectly adequate for the task of creating a flame where none presently exists. May be used for ""lighting a smoke"" or for throwing fire for a short distance as if lighting a bonfire. The reflective surface can be used for signaling."
5,Absolutely Love This Zippo!,"I have always wanted an Armored Zippo, but choked on the price. What I got this lighter for, less that 20 bucks! I mean, I'll probably get another one just for G.P. It is a great looking lighter, and classic in every sense. Love the sound of it opening and closing. The weight of it feels like I think a Zippo should. Don't know whats going on with Zippo lately, but a lot of their lighters feel, and look, extremely cheap. Now I love Zippo's, they are by far my favorite type of lighter, and this one really caught my eye when I saw it.On another note, this lighter IS made out of brass, and brass is a soft metal. BUT, brass stands up to the elements really well, which is why a lot of exterior fittings on ships are brass. This lighter, if you carry and use it, WILL get dinged up, and it WILL tarnish up. I imagine that is probably intended. I am 40 now, and have been using Zippo's for different reasons since I was about 12, and this is my favorite Zippo I have ever used."
3,"Useful book, very few changes in 3rd edition","This is a great book for preparing for the math GRE. Far more useful in terms of reviewing/learning material than the REA book. It has only one full length exam, but many practice problems, and every problem in the book has a detailed solution.WARNING: This book is essentially the same as the 2nd edition, with some minor errors fixed. As far as I can see, there are no new excercises, and the practice exam is basically the same. I would not recommend getting it if you already have the second edition. This is why I only gave it 3 stars."
1,lots of errors,this books review sucked. I found 5 mathematical errors in the first 19 pages. Five? I thought this was suppose to be a review book? AFter that I just used old exams to study from. Save yourself some money and don't buy the book.
1,Unacceptably many errors,"This book is riddled with errors. If you have a genuine need to review, it will do more harm than good. In the first chapter, I encountered:* boundary error in the first example problem* cosine sum/difference formulas swapped* sign errors in review problems"
2,Alright except for eggregious typos in formulas,Explanations tend to be good. Easy to follow order and lessons. But beware - has several major typos on formulas in instructional sections.
3,"Good summary of topics, but many tipos!","I bought and used this book and also ""GRE Mathematics (REA)"". The main draw back is that the book contains MANY tipos which make the book a bit unreliable. On the other hand, the book summaries the main topics very good and it also contains an excellent (fully solved!) practive exam.I would recommend buying this book and also ""GRE Mathematics (REA)"" (which contains six solved exams). You can use ""Cracking the GRE Math"" for revising the topics and ""GRE Mathematics (REA)"" for practicing the exams (which are more difficult than the real GRE)."
3,Too many typos!,"Basically, this book is so organized that you can prepare for your GRE math test. However, as I am solving Review Tests, there are lots of typos! It's frustrating a lot, so you should buy some other book, if you hate typos. Good luck!"
4,"A few errors, but overall a great review","This book is worth it for the tips and tricks. I took used this to prepare for my math GREs and while it was a supplemental text, it was definitely quite helpful. Don't use this alone to study for your GREs but it's definitely a useful review book."
2,poorly edited,"By the fourth practice exercise in this book, I've already encountered two typos that make the problems impossible to solve. This is simply unacceptable in mathematics prep books. You think they'd have fixed this by the third edition."
2,The problem,"The problem that i personaly have with this book is that even though each chapter gives you a review of main topics it does not prepair you enough for solving review questions at the end of the chapter. Read chapter 3(Calculus ii), for example, and try to solve the review questions--almost impossible. It would be much more useful if they would give some hints and technics how to sole those problems before you get to them--not after."
1,Useless,"This book is overly simplified and does not prepare test-takers effectively for the exam. It only includes one sample test, which is not nearly enough. The chapter on Special Topics lacks any review exercises and does not accurately reflect the level of difficulty of the exam."
5,STAIN BUSTER!,"I have not been this pleased with a book purchase in a long time! I read a piece in The New York Times that sparked my interest and purchased Field Guide to Stains. And let me say, that the stain removal techinques I've tried really work! What's more it's an interesting read and the close-up photos of the stains are not only hilarious, but very useful for identification. This book will get a lot of use around my house."
5,Spot on!,"If you have ever had to actually toss out a perfectly good garment that you loved with lots of more life left in it just because of a stain that resisted every attempt to dissolve it, this is most definitely the book for you.Packed with information and illustrations, The Field Guide to Stains will help you remove more than 100 different types of stains, and the information is divided up into sections by type for easy research while preparing laundry.The Field Guide to Stains: How to Identify and Remove Virtually Every Stain Known to Man is well-worth the investment, because potentially it will save you a fortune on even one favorite garment that you won't have to needlessly replace.I love this book!"
5,The Queen of Laundry Boo-Boos,"I'm not the best in the laundry room...don't even get a bottle of bleach around me, I'll ruin something everytime. But, I've very good at getting something on my clothes. This book is fabulous. Every time I have a stain, new or old, I refer to the book and follow the instructions to a T. Each time the stain is removed.Yesterday, I had a roller ball ink pen sticking out the bottom of a purse and, of course, I had five 10 inch marks all over the back of my hips on my BRAND NEW white pants. Sure enough, I got out the book, indexed ink and followed the directions. I could not believe the stain just got pulled off onto the other cloth.I keep the book in the laundry room above the washer!"
5,Sorayama takes his talent to a new height!,"His passion, and wonderfully diverse imagination is perfectly erotic. Every marriage he makes between stunning beauty, and suprising, if not shocking futurism, is intoxicating in the least. Daring you to let go of so many ideas, you will find yourself thinking not only of his art, but your own self. -Kevin"
1,Waste of your time and Money,"Bought this to compare output of my old 1995 Weber Grill to my new PGS-k40(Pacific Gas Specialities), which is NOT an infrared -- just 40000 btu output.The weber produced 650 on the thermometer, and the PGS was at 750 the last time I saw the reading, as the glass went cloudy, and cracked. The thermometer is useless after its 2nd time out.Will not waste my time on sending it back - paid $7.99 - guess at least I know the grill has good output. This was backed up by its performance in cooking a nicely seared steak."
5,works great,"I use it in my charbroil electric smoker. I keep it right on the cooking grate, while my food is smoking. I have to wipe it down after each use, to keep the smoke from building up on the unit, but that's to be expected."
2,"NIce, but did not last long","The overall build quality seems great, but just after a couple of uses the glass and the numbers started to become unreadable. It seems that it cannot survive the high heat that my grill is generating (~600 degrees)."
1,"Very poor, real waste of money","Great idea. I was excited to get this thermometer. I put it in an empty frying pan with the gas on high. After four minutes, the Teflon started gassing, indicating it was over 550F, but the thermometer only said 160F. Tested it in boiling water by putting the bottom only in the water, reading was accurate. then put it on the sink. After five minutes, the reading had dropped from 208F (our elevation is 3200 feet) to 150F. The problem is that this thing takes forever to change its reading. It is the slowest thermometer that I have ever seen. If I had waited for this thing to register 400F, my $40 pan would likely have melted. Great idea, useless product. Save your money."
1,Great for a disposable!,"Used this piece of junk one time on a new Weber gas grill. Seemed like a heavy well built item. Heated it up to 600 degrees for searing, then turned down the temp to finish cooking. The Red painted areas on the face turned black and the metal all discolored. Did not make direct contact with the flames. Very disappointed."
2,Not so great,"This thermometer is not accurate and takes way too much time to heat up to the same temp.OK for a general idea as to how hot your grill is, but not good for accurate temps.I would not recommend this item."
1,Horrible,This thermometer takes 15 minutes to decide on a temperature. It is way too slow to be used with a grill. After 1 smoke the lens was so charred I couldn't even see the needle through it anymore. I couldn't scrub it clean either.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this to check the surface temp on my gas grill. The first time I used it the color on the face faded so bad, it is really hard to read. The temp seem to read correctly, but it is hardly usable because you can't read the dial. I won't be getting another one!"
1,Not a quick read thermometer,"I got two of these (one for my brother) to know for certain when to put the steaks on the BBQ. This is the slowest thermometer I have ever used. It takes forever to warm up. While you wait and wait, your charcoal is burning up and you can't really tell if the gauge is going to go up further or not. So you wait some more. Save your money and use the old hand over the grill trick to judge the temperature."
2,slow,"I suspect that the my thermometer might be faulty, will be putting it in the oven to test it out soon.Used it twice, notice that the needle moves very slow to reflect the temperature. Even under direct flame it took like 3min to get to the temp reading. Another issue is that i got moisture under the glass and the screen is all blured and yellowish.I like the design though."
2,So So,"Bought two of these about 8 months ago. I grill a lot and have used them frequently. They didn't hold up very well. One got a little water in it and now clouds up whenever it's used. Both turned black and are barely legible (even if cleaned the black doesn't come off - it's on the inside of the glass). One of them reads 550 degrees when not in use. For the money, they were ok, but if you grill 2 - 3 times per week, don't expect them to last more than 8 or 9 months."
3,Accurate & useful,Advantages: Accuracy and easy to position on grill near food; excellent for slow/low temperature indirect heat roasting/smoking.Disadvantage: very difficult to clean the glass from smoke/grit that covers glass.
4,Works like a charm!,I recently started using a charcoal grill and this thermometer really makes life easier. You can tell when the coals are ready with just a glance and it also makes cooking indirectly a breeze. It gets a little dirty while BBQ'n but it cleans easy.
1,Didn't survive one use!!,"Apparently thermometer isn't made for the heat that a gas grill creates. In one use, the glass was cracked and the thermometer was dead. Total waste of money!!"
3,Love them Bucs,"Great hat, fits nice, always proud to wear my favorite team where ever I go, regardless of the talent and low payroll, I will root for them no matter what, until they fall 15-20 games out of first come August, sorry."
5,Perfection!,Magnifique! Perfect for the mini lathe. This product is very well made and built to last. For the money it's a no brainer!
3,Not ideal for the United States yet,"NokiaUSA has this listed on their store now, but for now there aren't maps for the NaviCore software that this uses. If you go to their website directly you'll not be able to purchase it for the US.I'm surprised the earlier reviewer found US street data *at all*.Buyers should note that this isn't useful for the US market in general at this time."
5,THIS CLARK SISTERS CD WILL UPLIFT YOUR SPIRITS.,"I ENJOYED LISTING TO THIS CD SO MUCH THAT I JUST ORDERED ANOTHER ONE FOR MY MOTHER. WHEN IS WAS A LITTLE GIRL MY MOTHER WOULD PLAY THE CLARK SISTERS AND OTHER GOSPEL GROUPS AND WHAT I REMEMBER THE MOST IS THE JOY & UP LIFTING VOICES THESE SISTERS HAVE. I AM HIGHLY RECOMMEMDING THIS CD AND FOR THIS PRICE EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE IT. PLAY IT ALL DAY, EVERYDAY. WHEN YOUR FEELING UP OR FELLING DOWN. THIS CD IS FOR EVERYOPNE. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LOCATE ""THE BEST OF"" CLARK SISTERS AND WAS NOT ABLE TO DO SO. I WAS PLEASE TO FIND IT ON AMAZON.COM MUSIC. I HAVE ALSO ORDERED THE CLARK SISTER GOSPEL CD ""MIRACLE""......"
5,The Dynamic Clark Sisters,This CD is HOT! The CLark SIsters is the #1 female gospel group in the world. THe sisters are phenomenal. The have excellent harmony whether it be live or audio. I tell you go out and purchase this CD if you don't you won't know what you missed.
5,A must.,"This is truly a classic gospel album, probably the best you can get from those years. The Clarck Sisters clearly remain as a top reference in the gospel music panorama, even today, and listening to this album you can know how did it begin. This is an honest, no-make-up-added recording and it has a bluessy-funky feeling, that will never get old. Musically great and God inspired, just the way a Gospel album should be. If you consider yourself a Gospel fan, I dont know how could you possibly not have this album yet."
5,Maybe only sisters can do what they've done.,"Listen to the harmonies, the scatlike vocal arpeggios in the vocal solos--Karen Clark in particular, the great keyboard work by Twinkie Clark--this is great music, period. I can't wait for a reunion album with Twink, Dorinda, Karen--with Twink writing and playing the piano, of course."
4,"The only serious guide around, as far as I know","I agree with the previous reviewer's comments. Get this book, a list of Foods to Avoid (ie high purine foods) from your doctor or HMO, and maybe check the current edition of the Merck Manual, and you'll be well prepared to deal with your gout."
3,Diet?,How can the authors write a book about gout without including a comprehensive section on diet?This is a major shortcoming to this publication...otherwise it is fine.
3,Pass The Black Cherry Juice,"I shouldn't be commenting on this, since I have not read the book. I don't know if I'm repeating information from the book, but as a Gout sufferer, I feel compelled to mention that black cherry juice or concentrate helped relieve the pain in my toe and ankle. Your mileage may vary, but Google it and there seems to be plenty of anecdotal evidence that it works."
2,didnt hold up to wind,i ordered this last fall for a 40th party it looks nice but after a windy day a piece of the top broke off and after that it all fell apart because it didnt have any support from the broke top rail
1,Rusted out in 3 months,We got this for our deck last May and it started to rust almost immediately. I took it down in August to store for the winter. Tried to assemble it today (mid April) and two parts fell apart in my hands. Save your money.
1,"Cheap, flimsy construction with thin canvas top","Unfortunately, they chose a convincing photo to display and the concept of knock-down construction sounded great. In reality, we should have payed better attention to the other reviews of this product. It went together quickly and easily but is so cheaply made that we are concerned that it won't even last this summer season. The inadequately supportive structure combined with very thin, cheap canvas was not worth the $250 this cost us. It took us twice the time to put together our last gazebo and it lasted two years. If you are considering this item, keep looking. You are sure to be disappointed with this."
3,Beware wind and ice,"The other reviewers are correct that strong wind will tear apart the fabric cover. An ice storm caused a small tear. Then high winds (50 mph) shredded it. If I can replace the cover, I will leave it up only in the Spring and Summer. The frame is still in good shape and the mosquito netting worked well last summer."
1,Collapsed on the 3rd day,"I purchased this product from Bond mfr company because it is CHEAP. I setup it and it looked very nice. However, there was rain (not shower) on the 3rd day, it collapsed while I watched it. This is a design issue, I bet the company never do any structure study (or did it but choose the inferior material anyway). What happened is the rain got collected on the canopy and would not flow away. This is a significant safety concern for seniors and disabilities. Be aware!Talked with Customer service of Bond back and forth a few times, the opinion is that is out of warranty coverage and do not admit that was a design defect issue."
2,Easy to set up...but!,I was looking for something to beatify my yard and a place to sit and relax. I found this product and it looked like it was what I wanted. I ordered it and when it came we found it very easy to set up. We did have a problem with it though. We only used it for about a week. The framework was too light and the wind folded the product and it collapsed.
4,"Functional, but could be a little larger","Adequately covers my Jobu gimbal but when closing the drawstring, the gimbal screw nut protrudes from the cover. I wish they had made the cover one inch longer."
3,Great until you use a headset,"I agree with the other reviews but when I use a headset, my friends complain that it is hard to hear me, a basic platronics headset with a microphone sensitivity switch set to max was an improvement but not sufficient. I have tested these two headsets with other phones without a problem. Uniden's customer service answer was to try their own headset but I fail to see how that is going to help when it cannot compare to the quality of the Platronics."
1,Not a good buy,Wife hates it..we have had trouble with signal breaking up and static on transmission. Contacted Uniden repair and they said to move to new location..easy said but not convenient to us.Micro Wave seems to drive it nuts. I guess it would work fine if used in the front yard.
3,Suspicious,"I'm very suspicious of the reviews for the Uniden's you sell. They're all so overblown and people write about things like how you can't listen in on a scanner, etc. Like they tried that? How much spare time do they have? The reviews are all total raves and for a company I've never heard of and of very inexpensive phones. I'm betting that the Uniden people are writing in on this product."
2,Not what you think!,I just bought a different brand name and it was not worth it. You can hear yourself talking back into the phone and it has static. I will not pay that kind of money for a digital phone. I just read in the sunday paper that digital phones are not worth it and have alot of problems! I returned that phone and will stick with the phone I have!
2,Don't be fooled by the specs!,"You'd logically assume that 2.4 GHz phones would offer better sound than 900 MHz ones which is why they cost more, right?WRONG!!!! I have another Uniden phone, at 900 MHz, and its sound quality is about 10 times better. This 2.4 GHz technology is all about marketing B.S.---I end up having to almost shout on this phone in order for other people to hear me properly, and I don't hear them as well either.It's too bad, because the answering machine seems to work quite well, easy to use functions. The phone is attractively designed, with the handset being of a very pleasing shape and appearance. The cellphone-like digital display is convenient too, but unfortunately the ""Rocket Dial"" memory-dialing system is a real pain to figure out and use consistently.My advice is, get a better phone for less money: opt for the 900 MHz stuff!"
4,"Best I've found, which isn't saying much","My phone is normally very clear and audible. It receives strong interference from my microwave oven, and occasionally gets weaker static for unknown reasons (my neighbors' microwaves, perhaps?) I rather like its ""Rocket Dial"" feature -- when I press and hold 3 for a second or so, it completes the number to my regular phone conference. If I then press the on button, it dials the conference number, pauses a few seconds to get into the system, then dials the security code. Nice and easy, and you see it before it dials so you can abort mistakes early."
5,New Waus in Teaching Writing,"Looking for a great resource to enhance your student's writing, this book is invaluable. With all the new writing standards, it gives teachers a step by step formula and is loaded with ideas. It is sure to help the new and experienced teacher. It covers all types of writing from the creative to the academic and business areas"
5,A blast to the past,Has to be the best compilation that I've ever heard. Guaranteed to make you sing along! Love it!
5,sweeping tale of historical fiction,"This is an epic tale about a young girl forced into slavery and her life's journey in regaining her freedom. Aminata Diallo's journey spans her childhood in Africa, her time on a slave ship, her growing up in an unfamiliar world (on plantations in the Americas, as a bookkeeper for an indigo trader and finally, as an assistant to the British recording names in the Book of Negroes) and finally back to her land. You won't be able to put it down -- and you'll root for her until the very last page. Highly recommended!"
4,A Good Read!,"I agree with the previous reviewer; Any Known Blood is engrossing, entertaining, and enriching. Weaving actual historical events and quotes into his fictional tale, Lawrence Hill engages the reader from first page to last. I do hope Mr. Hill gets the ""press"" and accolades he deserves. I eagerly await his next fictional effort."
5,"History, Humor, & Culture","I bought this book in Toronto a year ago and found it enriching and entertaining. The reader will be swept up in Langston Cane's search for his family's history, his struggling marriage, and his quest for a purpose in life. Along the way you'll receive entertaining lessons on Afro-Canadian culture, the trials of the bi-racial, and historical tales that reach as far back as the days of John Brown and the abolitionist movement. African-Americans need more ""serious"" authors who get the press of a Toni Morrison or Alice Walker. Lawrence Hill deserves to be one of them."
2,Blacklight?,"These seemed a lot different when I ordered it. It is listed as blacklight reactive, but I didn't see a big difference when placed in a room with only black lights. The colors barely got brighter. I don't know if it was the material or the color or a combination of the two. Also the material is really weird feeling- not exactly what I expected. It was more like a piece of cloth rather than a wall hanging."
5,A great support!,I read this book before my son was born. I very much related to the mom who wrote this book. She shared in the book many of the same feelings I was experiencing. There was also excellent information provided. This book gave me many things to think about before my son's birth. I had a chance to look into different types of special bottles and have them ordered and on hand before he was born. This book really helped me deal and understand the emotions I would experience as well as the medical situations he would go through. I would highly recommend this book to all new parents of cleft-affected children.
1,Your kids aren't the only ones! Can I have some choices????,"I found this book to have very basic information on cleft lip and palate, which was good in that it presents the conditions in non-medical terms for the most part. However, it did not explore some of the more current methods of treatment, including pre-surgical devices, and it seems to have been sponsored by a specific support group which is never really disclosed. I found the nauseating mention of this group over and over and over again to be quite an obvious overkill, and I had to return mine copy. I need a more objective book so that I may come to my own conclusions, and I suggest that other parents do the same."
3,A simple book about simple words,"I had expected more from this book. Several of the words seem to be redefined in order to fit the author's preconceived notions. An easy read and some good things to think about. Overall, not too deep, though"
1,This company are sham artist. Do not buy from them.,"On the container of this product it says ""1 pound"". Here they advertise this product for a set price for ""2 pounds"". But they only mail ""1 pound"".Amazon should be ashamed doing business with bait and switch thieves."
5,Powerful,This book shows how prayer and loyalty to the Holy Spirit can achieve so much.....though not without suffering. All people have a calling from God and some attend this calling heroically.
4,Great Purchase,The buyer was very good with reguards to the shipping of the item.Shipped item very quickly and the transaction was very smoothly.
5,Murder She Wrote Season 6,"I am almost finished with my Mother's favorite T.V. series. The price is just right and the receiving is even better, it reaches me faster than I can remember the date I ordered it."
3,"Murder, She Wrote sans Jessica Fletcher??","I automatically love anything Murder, She Wrote and own seasons 1-6 but I was really frustrated by the fact that Jessica Fletcher was in (it seemed like) less than half of the episodes. She only introduces the plot for a minute or two in the begining by reading a letter or recieving a phone call. It was very dissapointing."
5,MSW - 6th Season,Another outstanding season of one of the best shows ever. The writing is still good and the guest actors are always top notch.
3,A Weak Sister,"I think the 6th season of Murder, She Wrote was not nearly as good as the previous 5. Too many episodes were without Angela Lansbury and I especially disliked the ""Dennis Stanton"" character. I didn't enjoy the ""Michael Haggerty"" shows very much either. Too bad they couldn't have corralled Patrick McGoohan for that."
3,Too many episodes without Jessica,"I adore Murder She Wrote. Unfortunately, in the 6th season there are so many episodes that do not have Jessica involved. She begins each episode she's not in by talking to the audience and sharing a story of a friend but the plot does not include her at all. I'm not sure why (was she ill? did she need a longer break? did she have other commitments?) but without her solving the crime, I'm not interested. If you don't mind episodes without her then you'll enjoy this season. I would return it if I didn't take so long to watch it."
1,Hideous season,"About half of the episodes are pathetic experiments with unknown detectives (no Jessica), where the producers tried out new show formats.***Don't buy this season!!!!***"
2,Is this really the sixth season?,"I was really excited to buy this season, but it did not really met my expectations. Many of the episodes were ""introduced"" by Jessica. The third disc has reruns of other episods. I was really disapointed."
4,Inner Worth vs Outward Appearance,"I read this book to try to understand the ""modesty"" rules followed by Orthodox Jewish woman. I came to it as a modern woman and a feminist who was more than a little put-off by any type of dress code. After reading this book, I had to reevaluate the present societal value of appearances. I came away with a greater understanding of self-worth.This book explains the observance of modesty in simple and clear language with many anecdotal accounts. More importantly, the author tackles the opposition of inner worth and outward show. Are you only what you appear or are you even more? And if you are more than why would you need to show off? I'm taking a second look at how I want to present myself and how much more my inner self matters."
2,Not Eddie's best work.,"All new material, but full of allusions to earlier bits for cheap laughter and he mostly just rambles on about this and that, felt phoned in. He piles on the sound effects and impersonations, most of which were over my head, and I only laughed once or twice. I liked the stuff about computers and wish he'd mined that more. As it stands nothing special. He is a brilliant thinker and storyteller but he needs to work on his punchlines. I liked the stage dressings, I guess."
4,"Not his Best, Maybe his worst... But the worst has it's moments.","I was there the first night this was recorded. From the start he seemed a bit off, but he did eventually find his groove. The DVD is pretty tight, performance and material wise, but it definitely is not as strong as the others. Still, if your a fan, pick up a copy. It has its moments.ODD THING... between two tracks (Darwin / Creationism) toward the end of the DVD there was Massive skipping. Any one else find this or do I have Shit copy???Please let me know."
1,A total let down,"We went to see this show in Dallas and really enjoyed it, but this didn't seem to be the same show at all. I think I chuckled twice. This is not the Eddie we know. He was off. The political digs didn't help his performance at all and for the most part this seemed like a ""that'll do"" kind of performance, a B effort. Very nearly sent it back.. not worth the postage. Sorry Eddie - you blew it."
4,very cute,"I ordered these cobalt blue glass plugs in the 0g size. They seem a bit shorter than in the picture, but are just the right length to fit my earlobes snugly. When viewed from the front (while being worn), they appear very dark blue, almost black... the color appears more blue when light is shining through them. They're great for work (or anytime you want your gauged ears to be a bit more subtle/toned-down) because they look almost like ""button"" style earrings. Overall, they seem well-made and I'm happy w/ them. Mine arrived in a small box padded w/ lots of bubble wrap to prevent breakage."
4,Brakepads were nice,But they didn't fit the Honda Civic 2008 like Amazon said they would. I don't know whether Amazon or this company sets that option...
4,Brake Pads Work Great,"Akebono ACT787 ProACT Ultra-Premium Ceramic Brake Pad SetI received these brake pads from Amazon promptly and there were exactly the right pad for my Honda Accord. It was relatively easy to figure out which model to order. The instructions to install them were helpful, but very brief - not as easy to understand as I had hope for. However, installation went smoothly (note: I've installed brake pads many times before, so it might not go so smoothly for a novice). Now to the bottom line: the brake pads work great! They seem to be much smoother and more linear in response to brake pedal pressure than the original Honda brake pads. I recommend them."
4,Fast & nice,It is a worthy succesor on 3.0's Book of Evil.It is not core though so only buy if needed.Would recommend it to average players that value more the role than the dice throwing.
3,Satisfactory Pad,"I have owned Hawk HPS+ pads on my old Honda Prelude. They dusted and squeaked, but once up to temp they had absurd stopping power. These HPS pads now on a Honda S2000 are nothing like their big brother. I have done 2 autocrosses on these pads, and quite a bit of hard-brake-cooking mountain road drives. The HPS resits brake fade quite well. However compared to the OEM Honda S2000 pad they have slightly lesser overall stopping power, lesser initial bite, and dust significantly more. This is probably due to Honda's aggressive S2000 OEM compound. The pads have never squeaked. When it comes time to replace these I will go back to the HPS+."
2,Confusing Game,"If you like Trivial Pursuit, I doubt that you'll like this game. First off, the instruction are really confusing. A group of 20-something adults couldn't figure it out right away. The game is played in teams and depending on the outcome of the roll, you can decide to swap team members. The idea of the game is neat and the questions are pretty good but it's just not a great game."
2,"""In Pursuit of a better game""","I was very disappointed with this game. I thought since it was a Trivial Pursuit game that I would would enjoy it as much as the original. The questions are obscure and boring, there is no real objective to the game, the rules are confusing and the game board and pieces are poor quality. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game and stick with original Trivial Pursuit games!"
1,Misses the mark,"Wow, i was shocked to find i HATED this game. We are trivia buffs in our house.. this game was slow, boring and very hard to get.. its it definitely NOT designed for small groups , you need at least several 3-4 player teams for this game to work out. and the questions were silly. we opted to not play this one.. in fact i think it got left at a friends home we were that disappointed in it. wish i could have gotten my money back for this one."
3,"Get the ""Advanced"" version of this book instead","This is a good book but even if you are a beginner you should instead buy the version of this book that is billed as for advanced players. The advanced book is essentially the same book as this book (large portions are copied verbatim from one book to the other), but with some additional material added. They're the same price, so if you buy the advanced one you will be getting more for your money."
2,Buyer beware,"This is one of my favorite all-time albums. The band, while having great material and sound, has hints of Blood, Sweat and Tears, Chicago, and some Gary Pucket. The title track, Vehicle, is now widely used for General Motors cars commercials.Alas, this CD is a very poor shadow of the original album. The re-mastering is inept, as the sound is muffled, tinny sometimes, and overly bassy most of the time. It is not possible to adjust your equalizer to make it sound right.It hurts to listen to this poorly done CD. My advise: get the vynil if possible."
4,Amazon Strikes Again.....Score Another Old Album,"This is another case of replacing an old album that's been lost or stolen with a CD. In about 1971 I played lead guitar and sang for a band in the Atlanta area called ""Avalanche"", we were a horn band and used to open with the song Vehicle. As my album has been long disappeared from my collection, I opted to replace it from Amazon. And it sounds great, you might note that ""American Idol"" runner up Bo Buice sang ""Vehicle"" in the competition and recorded it with Richie Sambora on his 1st album, also performing it on Jay Leno's Tonight Show. If not for ""Vehicle"" I probably would not have replaced the record. The rest of the songs, while being OK are not significant enough for purchase. They're OK but not great. At the right price it makes a nice addition and representation of the 70's era horn bands for your record collection."
1,"Terribly disappointing sound quality on this ""Magic"" label release","Quite an example of uneven sound quality that is totally unforgiveable in this current day and age. I was very excited to finally find this ""LP"" on CD and couldn't wait to play it...however, when the CD arrived I could not believe how poor the sound quality was...drop-outs, surface noise, distortion--simply unplayable. I have heard direct transfers from LP to CD that sound waaaaaay beter than this garbage. My happy ending is that a few years later I was lucky enough to discover the Ides of March CD on the Rhino Handmade label. It was like Magic!--What a difference professional sound quality makes."
4,Great tune!,"If only for Vehicle, it's worth having. A very mature tune for such young guys at the time."
5,Bo Bice breathes Life into an Old rock Rocker,Bo Bice Really blew me out of my bed when he sang Vehicle ..I was thinking and hear the original almost weekly on the rock oldies..I have always Loved the song and thinking when I first Saw Bow Bice..I thought..I bet he would be Great singing Vehicle..and to my ultimate suprise..thats what he comes out blowing..I was so happy and impressed and shocked..because I had just told a co-worker..a week before..that I knew of a song he should try..and he did it..and did it Great..he should release it HIMself..he was that good..YOU go BOW!.I doubt he can top that..also he ended the song on a different note then the original..and it Was a Great ending note. Better then the original!
3,The bare facts,"This title is a bare bones summary of the the history of Sir WIllaim Lyons' Swallow and Jaguar cars. It summarises the history of Jaguar and its predecessor, Swallow in sections divided into pre war, post war and 50s, 60s ,70s, 80s and 90s.It does feature some quite pleasant colour photographs, and a few odd ones - there is a quite tacky gold XKE with gold plate where chrome should be, a hood (bonnet) with some kind of pattern painted on it, and a gold plated 'leaper' hood ornament. The XKE never came with the leaper , much less a gold one!However there are many other gorgeous examples of original and rare Jaguar cars which are a feast for the eye.As a concise beginner's pamphlet this book is adequate. If it's in depth technical specifications and objective criticism of the cars and their characters, then you will find better elsewhere, although not at this price, which is excellent value for money.Don't buy this book for the information , buy it for the p! ictures."
5,For the un-sporty who always get picked last,"This was one of my favorite books as a child, because I was never very athletic or the one chosen first for a team in gym. Pig hates gym class, and when the class plays capture the flag, the teams argue over whose side he has to be on. But when the chips are down, he finds that teamwork and determination may make up for his lack of speed. I give it a cautious five stars because some of this 1977 book is out of sync with today's PC society (when Pig drops a ball in gym he is called ""butterhoves"" and is told he is too fat... plus who lets kids pick teams today?) But it is a wonderful book, sure to be enjoyed if you, like me, are a bit too slow, or heavy, or not sports-inclined."
1,Christmas day disappointment,Visibly dirty in the chip area...... product did not work. Cannot rate the quality of product due to it not working.
1,UNBEILEBABLY BORING,I REALLY LIKED THIS PICTURE ASHIGH SCHOOL KID IN THE '80'SLENNY BRUCE was the cuttig edge comedian back thenbutther was hardly any funny about this movieit's just LENNY BRUCErambling on about his poor patheticlife i can't even see why i was so enthraled abot him way backwhen no comedic value a stinkerif you want comedy buy CADDSHACKand see how the master ROGER DANGERFEILD is as at his best
4,A Westerner's look at the West,"Fred Harman (1902-82), although born in Missouri, was taken in infancy to Colorado and there grew up steeped in the history, lore, and landscape of the West. He was best known as the creator of the long-popular comic strip ""Red Ryder,"" but in his late 50's he began a second career as a serious painter of the real and legendary aspects of the region. This book collects 88 of his paintings, some in color, others reproduced in BW, and ranging from charater portraits to Russell/Remington-style action pictures. Here are scouts and buffalo hunters, Indians (both Navajos and plains tribes), animals wild and tame, stagecoaches and sheep wagons, and above all cowboys and their horses. Each is on a double-page spread with a brief note describing the situation portrayed. There's also a biographical introduction that covers Harman's life and career. Lovers of Western art won't fail to enjoy these."
2,Predictable,"Unfortunately this film does not do a great story justice. The script struck me as simplistic, flat, and utterly predictable."
3,Had much more potential...,"I really was looking forward to seeing this film. Rugby as a mechanism for healing racial and political divisions in South Africa. Go team! But...Both Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon failed to make their characters come alive as significant players in this particular story. And most importantly, Clint Eastwood didn't make me believe that this particular rugby team had a healing effect on the nation. And isn't this what the film was about?I hoped for more..."
5,A Great Movie,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years! It tells a very special story about a critical time in the history of South Africa, when the system of apartheid had recently been eliminated. It shows that sports, in certain circumstances, can have a huge positive impact on a nation's development. Clint Eastwood once again proves he knows a story worth telling! Morgan Freeman should have won an academy award for his portrayal of Nelson Mandela. Matt Damon is believable as a rugby player. If you liked sports movies like ""Hoosiers"" or ""Miracle"" you will enjoy this movie! If you enjoy this movie, you should consider purchasing the documentary film ""The 16th Man,"" which allows you to get to know the coach and some of the players involved in the 1995 World Cup Rugby preparations and tournament."
4,Thought it was pretty good,"For all my reviews visit my websitePlease note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.Well, this movie does its job right. It both raises awareness of...something. It also tells us...something. Okay, lemme just say, I did not like this nearly as much as The Shawshank Redemption. I think this movie did it's job at telling a story (based off a book based off true events...seriously people.) It also does its job of...well...telling a story. I mean, there's not too much I can say about this movie. It just is good, real good at some parts. It does get confusing, I wasn't liking it for a substantial amount of time. However, I realized what the message was...it's just not within the idea of text or talking. Since this movie is based off true events, there's not much more I can say. Morgan Freeman is awesome!The Rating?.... 3.6+--"
1,Invictus,The movie is not in English nor will not play in the DVD player. This feature was not mentioned when I purchased it.
4,Invictus,"I was not aware of this historical event and was very happy to enjoy the performances of two of my favorite actors (Freeman and Damon)in this. The movie, purchased from Amazon.com, was exciting and held my interest for the entire length of the movie."
4,Invictus...well worth the money,"The movie was fairly streamlined...there were just a few hiccups where the video was not in sync ( picture stopped while narration continued), but for the most part I would and did recommend the site to my fellow classmates."
4,Movie,"This was a very good movie. If their was one living person that I would like to meet, it would be Nelson Mandela. His courage, ideas and drive brought a country together. He used anything and everything to work towards unity, this is one method that is very inspiring."
4,Feel good movie,Morgan Freeman was excellent as Nelson Mandella and will surely be nominated for an academy award.
1,Too bad I can't see it,"Buyer beware! To view this disc my disc says I need a ""special ramped-up Blu-Ray player, broadband internet, and lots of hard disc space"" -- to watch a movie! I'd rather have a DVD. If I'd only known."
1,Mandela Deserved Better,"I hated this film. Morgan Freeman is not cut out to play Nelson Mandela; the real Mandela deserves better representation. Freeman could not keep the South African accent going, he looked disconnected from the rest of the actors and totally awkward, no warmth, no substance, no serious undertaking of Mandela character. Matt Damon's talents were totally wasted here. And to know that Clint Eastwood directed a movie about this topic is a joke. This was sheer mockery of an important subject matter. Clint Eastwood should stick to what he knows best, and taking on a very dynamic and important man as Mandela was not something Eastwood was capable of accomplishing."
4,Good movie to watch.,I enjoyed this movie. I have seen it before but I decided to rent it again since one of my sons plays rugby in high school. It was a good movie to show that by putting some hard work into something and the result might surprise you. Keep pressing on and don't give up.
4,Certainly Satisfied,"This movie is a great one and it was delivered quickly, just in time for the Holidays. Still wrapped in plastic, with a shinning cover, the DVD was brand new and in great condition. I would definitely recommend this item to a friend."
2,"Not for me - Maybe for you, maybe not.","I really enjoy movies with Morgan Freeman in them and I do enjoy sports films. However, I could not get into this one, the movie did an excellent job showing the power struggle going on in South Africa and how somewhat of a little thing like changing the colors and a name for a rugby team could really make a difference.However, I've never played rugby before and no little about the sport or the rules that are played so it was a little confusing and while you are trying to take time to figure things out you miss part of what is going on in the movie. I think it would have been better if they somehow incorporated rugby rules into the movie."
5,Invictus,Invictus is an excellent tutorial for anyone encountering bias in the community. Mr Damon was an excellent star for the portrayal. Morgan Freeman was excellent as another star of the movie.
1,Poor QC,"Slow lens even for a low end DSLR, lasted two weeks before focus stopped working. Expect better than that from Olympus and after reading all the reviews elsewhere I see that it is a common problem, would not be so bad if we could even manual focus but it will not and as with all major manufacturer's they no longer have local repair so you have to pay to ship for repairs.No more Olympus for us."
3,Not as great as I would have thought,On the look for another a brush. This one doesn't do it for my long-hair cat.
3,Apparently not cat friendly,Product works great from a user perspective but the sharp combing needles appear to bother our cats. They now run and hide anytime they see the brush in a hand.
2,Self Cleaning Slicker,"Purchased this for my dog, don't waste your money, it really doesn't do the job it stated it does. Would NEVER purchase again."
3,Not what I thought it was,"I bought something similar a while ago, but the tines have gotten bent over time and I fear the cats (yes, I got this for cats) are getting poked by misalligned tines.The old one can lock in the retracted (cleaning) position, minimizing such bending, especially as my cats will chew on it if left within their reach. The new one retracts only when the button is pushed.Aside from that, it's quite satisfactory, great for removing excess hair. But a pain to have to put out of cat reach when not in use."
3,It was okay,"It came damaged. When I returned it and received the replacement, it was damaged too (Amazon came thru and refunded me in full). But I was not able to hear all of it; what I did hear seemed to be the same melody played over and over."
5,An absolute dream to relax or trance to!,"I've been hypnotizing people professionally for nearly ten years and have encountered *lots* of relaxing music. This CD remains my all-time favorite. It's two long, unbroken tracks and both are soft, flowing, transportive soundscapes of pure bliss. Let this cd sooth away your stress, melt your mind and lift you right out of your body...you won't be disappointed!"
5,One of the most profoundly beautiful pieces of music ever,"I first came across this piece of music many years ago on a PBS radio program called ""Music from the Hearts of Space"" and spent the next 10 years or so trying to find a place to buy it. I finally found it quite by accident in an obscure 2nd-hand CD store in LA. Too bad Amazon.com didn't exist at that time. Forget the new-agey mumbo-jumbo usually associated with this type of music. It is simply one of the most profoundly beautiful pieces of music ever made. It is extremely relaxing. It gets my vote for one of the 10 CD's I'd want with me if I were deserted on an island. Highly recommended!"
3,A good book,"For people that have an interest in Snipers and all they do, you've probably heard or read these stories before. Still, Carlos Hathcock's story is a good read again and again."
4,Good book,"Some of the stories in this book mix into one big ""sniper story"", though some stand out and are remembered. A good continuation for ""One shot, one kill"" for those who are interested in the subject and do not expect much artistism or drama from the book. The sniper's vocabulary at the end of ""Crosshairs..."" is also interesting. Thank you for the book!"
4,Kill zone,Very interesting inside view on the life of a military sniper/It shows the effect of a sniper on the battlefield.
3,"shooter, not writer","Mr. Roberts is a real sniper, but needs a better editor to be a good writer. The book is a series of short chapters, not really tied together in any coherent fashion. A few technical errors detracted from my enjoyment of the book. Some interesting vignettes, but not an addition to my precision shooting library."
3,"writing, problematic",This book would have been so much better if it were written in a more active voice and without glaring generalizations.
2,No Intellectual Stimulation whatsoever,"This book reads like an incredibly long fashion article. (Some fashion articles in Vogue and Harper's are excellent, but it's obvious why this one worked at MLLE.) It lacks depth in the subject matter. For all the work that she pu into it, I feel like she is just skimming the surface. It's writing style is utterly irreverant. No wonder people find fashion vapid and superfluous. The points that were made in the book are nothing ground breaking or thought provoking. It was well researched, lots of statistics, names and numbers, but I dont think that the writer understands fashion at a level where she can write about it in the normative sense."
2,Sucks!,"I was sorry I didn't follow the advice of others and skip this one. This book was SO BORING. Could have been called ""101 ways to say the same thing"" because she repeated her points over and over. The so-called ""fashion victim"" she was referring to seems to be a figament of her imagination. If they do exist as she describes them, they are shallow and not worth writing a book about."
2,"What, no works cited?","For a journalist, I'm shocked that Lee has compiled such research without providing exact dates, times, locations, publications, and interviews. I was expecting an unapologetic unveiling of the fashion industry along the lines of Schlossinger's ""Fast Food Nation"". Boy, was I disappointed.And about the court case referred to on page 34 -which editor allowed for such paraphrasing with no requirement for formal citation? Obviously, one un-versed in the term, ""libel""."
5,Great support and very mild pronation,"The 720 is soft to run and walk in, has amazing ankle support and a very mild pronation control that can be seen while running but not felt.my first mild pronation shoe and it has improved my running enjoyment, No more ankle and knee problems that I've experienced with moderate pronation shoes.New Balance has a winner with the 720"
1,NOTHING NEW HERE,"DON'T BUY THIS RIP OFF DVD! THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW HERE. CLIPS FROM SHINDIG, WHERE THE ACTION IS, ENGLISH TV, FRENCH TV, AND GERMAN TV. QUALITY IS NO BETTER OR WORSE THAN PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE VERSIONS. IT APPEARS THERE WILL NEVER BE A HIGH QUALITY YARDBIRDS RETROSPECTIVE DVD."
1,Some of the HAZIEST Video I've seen,"I'm not sure how this DVD got out there. No titles no credits and - while a few of the performances that look like a german TV show are watchable - most look like someone rubbed vasoline over the lens. I can't even recommend this to a Yardbirds completist.I wasted 40 minutes watching it. Save yourself the time. And thank me for alerting you. ;-)Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
4,Many uses for these...,"Though a little too expensive, these are well made and have many uses. We use them to identify our keys, our many types of cords/wires for phones, computers, chargers, etc. We use a thin point permanent ink pen. I think you get the idea: we no longer are at a loss which charger to use for a phone, camera, computer etc. Our choice of 4 star is only because they cost a about 50 cents each."
1,Shoddy,"This cheaply made, poorly constructed metal box with key lock is way overpriced. What a disappointment. To top it off, poor packaging for shipment resulted in the two halves of the box being jammed together such that I had to use a screwdriver to pry them open."
2,Tiny little figure embedded in a stinky fizzy ball,"My grandson loved watching the ball dissolve and he likes having the little Ben 10 figures but the figures are too small to do much with (and easy to lose) and the ball, possibly intentionally, smelled alien.I would buy more if they sold for $.50 apiece but no higher."
1,Voice quality on Answering machine poor,"The phone itself isn't bad, but I rated it a 1 star for the poor quality of voice/sound on the answering machine. I tried several digital answering machines and finally ended up with the Panasonic kx-tg2247s phone/answering machine. It works great and has good sound quality."
2,"bad reception, caller id registry","I can honestly say I regret buying this phone. With all the technology out there, I don't know how I ever found myself buying a 900 mhz ANALOG phone. To make a long story short, the reception is full of static and prone to be heard by neighbors. A neighbor picked up on my conversation ( I know it was him because I heard his pets in the background ). Also, the caller ID takes several rings to register the number. Spend a little more and go with a stronger transmission ( 2.4 mhz and digital as opposed to analog )."
2,"Phone OK, Answerer quality deficient","We were disappointed with the sound quality of the recorded messages (both incoming and outgoing). The phone itself was OK, but we returned it for the lack of recording quality (our old Casio had much better sound quality, unfortunately it died and Casio seems to be out of the phone/answerer business these days)."
2,You can hear you neighbors,In this day and age you should not need to worry about crossing lines or signels with your neighbors.....But on this phone we get background noise about 20% of the time. We use it for the answering machine now...
3,"Good phone, 1 problem","I liked everything about this phone, except for the fact that every time I spoke into the phone, my voice was amplified back into the earpiece which was very annoying to me. Otherwise, this phone was great (quality, clarity, range, ease of use). If you talk softly, this phone will probably be great for you, otherwise try a Panasonic."
1,Poor quality,"I bought one one month ago. Now I'm suffering discontinous voice and interrupted calls. I don't know if this is a common problem or not. When I call uniden, they just let me to contact repair department."
3,"Works well, somewhat noisy headset jack",This cordless phone works well so far after several weeks of use. One problem is the noisy headset jack: the noise is generated when there is even a slightest movement of the plug--possibly a bad solder joint.
3,Something you can live without,I bought it from my Amazon goldbox. my review follows...Plus: So it comes with caller ID and one mailbox digital answering machine (must haves for small apartment dwellers with space-saving requirements).Minus: The handset is designed for Frodo Baggins. It is rather uncomfortably small.On Net: Save yourself the trouble - buy a higher than 900mhz set.
2,Just OK,"This phone just works OK for me. The price is good, but the quality is limited. I can hear my neighbors when I am using this phone 50% time. I have though it was because I was living in a dorm and I was so close to other students. But, unfortunately, it seems like a common problem for this phone."
4,"Good value. Keep it on ""Lo.""","To make a long story short, the ringer on it has a ""high"" setting that is so incredibly loud...my neighbors almost mistook it for an air raid siren. Tonight, I finally found a way to turn it down.The phone and built-in answering machine are functional and attractive enough. Plenty of good features (like the caller ID screen) make it a bargain at the price.Just do the neighborhood a favor. Keep it on LO."
1,save your money...,"I never write these reviews but felt compelled after buying this piece of garbage. It worked ok for the first few months but then I gradually started hearing more and more crackling and interference. The straw that broke the camel's back was when my fiancee called and I couldn't hear her. When I tried to change the channel it bascially just died. I promptly spiked the phone on the floor into a million pieces. The battery never seemed to really hook up right to the unit, the caller ID came up when it wanted to, and the reception was uneven.Save your money!!! Buy something else."
3,day's last,"doris day's last group of hits included are mostly in perfect quality stereo, many for the first time. Only diappointment is the mono anyway the wind blows, which always appears in mono, inspite of fact i have an lp whith the sing featured in perfect stereo (without the voice overdubs in second verse)."
2,Very Disappointed with the A640,"I bought this camera to replace my Olympus C5060 Wide Zoom. I bought this camera to take pictures on a faily trip to Disneyworld & was sad to see many ""could have been great"" pictures marred by blur & red-eye. Here are my thoughts on this camera:1) Blurry photos - Canon did not include image stabilization in this camera & it clearly shows. Many of my pictures are blurry, fuzzy & look out of focus. On my old Olympus this rarely happened, on the A640 it was commonplace.2) Red-Eye: Many pictures indoors were plaged by terrible red eye. Again Canon did not include red-eye reduction & it is evident in many of my pictures.Overall I got some good pictures with this camera, but far too many blurry & bad photos to give this camera a good rating. After owning it for over a month, i'm already in the market for a camera that will take better pictures! My Olympus served me well for several years but this camera is not consistent enough for me."
4,Great camera,This is a great camera. The only problem I had with it is it takes a while to figure out how to use the features. I still haven't figured everything out and I bought it a few months ago.
5,No complaints...,The camera was everything I expected of it... I was looking for a camera that was better than your usual point and click and that was the step before buying an SLR camera so this was the perfect fit. It has enough controls that I can start playing with some features and start creating interesting pictures. At the same time its very easy to point and click and just snap pictures during a special event. I would definately recommend it as an easy transportable and flexible camera.
3,Great camera but not very durable!,I really love this camera. It takes amazing photos and the batteries last forever. I've only changed the batteries twice and I've had this camera for 9 months. I use it very often! But the lense cover is flimsy and broke the first month just from opening and closing. And now there are lines in the pictures! I have to try to return it already and I take extremely good care of it so there is no reason that it should already be broken!
2,Uncertain,We are still not sure if there is a malfunction with this camara or with the program it is being used with. It is the same type of camara as we had but part of the time it isn't working properly.
4,Great Camera - Cumbersome software,"The camera is great, though I agree it does less well in low light. We have Windows98SE which means you have to install their software ZoomBrowser. This opens every single image on the card before you can do anything. Way too slow. After 2 calls to tech support, we gave up. They suggested it is not really designed for 98SE, and I suggested they should say that in the description. After much frustration, we went out and bought a card reader for $20. It does enable you to directly pull the images from the card onto the computer so that problem is solved, but you have to remove the card each time which is more cumbersome. I wrote this review to let those with Windows98SE to expect glitches, and that a card reader, while cumbersome will solve the issues."
1,"Not Flashy, Not Good","I've owned mine for a little more than 18 months. The camera is fine, if nothing spectacular. However, the flash has completely quit working. A brief internet search reveals this to be a very common problem so use extreme caution if you're looking to get this item. You've been warned (I wish I had been)."
5,Awesome Pix,"I purchased this camera recently and am blown away by its quality and the great pix it takes. Granted we had a cheap 3.1mp Kodak with no Zoom prior to this one, but I can tell this one takes amazing pictures..It was actually recommended to me by a photographer friend and I am happy I listened. The screen come out and everything so you can see at different angles."
3,A little disappointed,"I bought this after much research. My daughter has a Canon A510 and the pictures are clear and the camera is so easy to use. When we book a trip to Europe I decided to get the A640 for myself.Even though the camera is 10Megapixels the photos seem a little blah.Color is not as sharp as I had hoped.Speed is still slow...when trying to take a quick shot, even with the high speed card, which was $150, the speed to shoot is slower than I need.Love the LCD viewfinder that is adjustable. Maybe I just need more practice with this one."
4,Camera Review,"I purchased this camera as a gift, and the person appears to be very happy with the product."
3,Canon Snap Shot 640,It's not really clear as it says in the ads. My 4.00 MP seems to be clearer than my new 10.0 MP.
3,PRODUCT GOOD - AMAZON SHIPPING TOO SLOW,Ordered the product via amazon with shipping paid on purchase. Item was shown as in stock took 3+ weeks to receive.
4,Good Pictures,"This camera is pretty much amazing, I love it! The pictures are awesome, so far. The LCD is really pretty crappy. Not very high quality at all, also the battery compartment is kinda hard to maneuver at first. Once you get the hang of it its not a big deal, but when I put in my 2.0MB sd card, apparently its too thick and it wouldn't come out of the camera easily. All in all, the camera is great, pics are awesome. Video is very good for being a digital camera and not a camcorder. I would recommend it for someone looking for a good quality camera for just personal use."
5,Great Camera!,My Epson broke a while back and I have been sadly without a camera. This was my Christmas present this year and I absolutely LOVE it!! I was interested in this particular camera after seeing it mentioned in Consumer Reports as Canon's latest. The digital & optical zoom are fantastic for a smaller size camera and I also LOVE the movie feature. I had checked everywhere and Amazon definitely had the best price plus it qualified for free shipping and it arrived super fast. I would highly recommend this camera. Note: The memory card that comes with it has a very small capacity so I did need to purchase a 2GB card.
5,Excellent Little Quality Digital Camera,I bought this camera to put in my purse when I don't want to lug the larger digital SLR one around. Very impressed with the quality of photographs under all lighting conditions. The price makes it that much better.
3,"Good camera, but...","I think for most folks, most of the time, this will be a fine camera. But for me, there was one big show-stopper: a minimum aperture of f8. This means you can take good portraits and vacation shots with it, but doesn't allow anything semi-serious. You won't get very good depth of field. For a nature photographer, this won't work!I was looking for a lightweight, high capability digital that I could use for mountaineering and rock climbing. The weight and capability seem fine, but I need the small aperture. I returned this camera (Amazon's return policy seems quick and easy--thank you!) and will instead try the Fuji S700 (which has a minimum f13). Note--almost all the compact digitals seem to have this problem. If you want good depth of field, you'll need to either look hard or go with a more sophisticated (i.e., heavier and more expensive) camera."
1,Battery Leak bad customer service,"My camera was just out of warranty and the batteries leaked. The company agreed to fix my camera then returned it without fixing it and charged me anyway. They would not release my camera for delivery without a signature so now they have our broken camera. They finally returned the charge, but we are still dissatisfied with them."
1,Worst camera ever!!!,"I bought this camera last march for our trip to Europe. The pictures were never of the quality of my Canon Elph 2 mp. A couple weeks ago the button to switch from shoot to view fell off. Yesterday the camera quit working all together. I have called Canon but they told me that the warranty was up. After three cameras and two video cameras, the rep told me; OH WELL!! I think I will buy my next camera from Nikon or Sony."
1,MP 2002 for Dummies is junk,"Buy this book only if you don't need it. The VB part is junk! It will look cute on your computer bookshelf. You like getting hung in dead ends, this book is for you. Reference to help on the web is just an advertisement. The CD file names aren't named for reference in the book and the chapter/file directories are confused. The book file transcriptions don't work - the CD ones do. The price is dropping as people realize this one is a dud. Save your money."
4,Decent introductory guide to MapPoint,"Although it perhaps doesn't go into the depth that the previous review desired, this book provides a good overall view of what MapPoint can do. Even if you have used MapPoint quite a few times before, you will probably discover new functionality in areas that you have rarely used. Also includes a number of useful tips that you probably won't find yourself.The programming interface to MapPoint is very useful because it allows MapPoint to be extended. Yes, the VB content in this book is limited, and only goes far enough to show you what is possible. Luckily the documentation that Microsoft provides with MapPoint includes a fully documented object model. The book wisely avoids duplicating this reference. For further help with using the VB API or using it in a different language (via COM), I recommend the microsoft.public.mappoint newsgroup or the articles and forums on http://www.mp2kmag.com/ - both of which are listed in the book."
3,MapPoint for Dummies,A good book if you are looking for how to do maps and insert them into documents. Less helpful in providing information on how to integrate business information into graphics.
4,Return To The Blackfield,"First I must say that this is a very good CD. However, I don't think it has the edge that the first CD had. It has a bit more ""poppy"" sound than the original. Of course it still has Steve Wilson's magic touch that always seems to deliver something interesting. With the original Blackfield there wasn't anything lacking with any track. I agree that the original CD is a masterpiece. With Blackfield II I think that although it is a very good piece of work, it somehow falls short. But I will continue to listen and enjoy their work. It is far and above most of today's popular music."
2,Anderson L,"This outing from Steve Wilson and Aviv Geffen was a big disappointment to me. For one, there are no standout songs on this cd. Its all one big mish mosh. I figured that this would be at least as strong as the first Blackfield cd. The songwriting seems weak and slapped together. They are going to have do something spectacular if I buy another cd of theirs. Also the song ""Where is my love"" shouldn't have been redone. It should have been left off this cd."
2,TALK ABOUT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Yet another band whose debut release was a musical ""sniper"" only to follow up with a ""hand-grenade.""Just barely in the ballpark.Boring. Uninspired.I was actually embarrassed for SW/Avi upon hearing this rehash.Pass."
4,Imagine a more mellow modern day Porcupine Tree,"This is not music that is going to blow your doors off, or leave your jaw on the floor, but it is a collection of very good songs. If you are familiar with the last several Porcupine Tree records, imagine the songs being more mellow with greater emphasis on piano, acoustic guitar, and strings. And that is what you will get with Blackfield."
5,"quiet, understated, unpretentious, beautiful","Blackfield II is beautifully-written, has smart lyrics, has great production value and is extremely catchy. Even the cd packaging is beautiful. It's a great album to just sit and get lost in.I highly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Coldplay, Radiohead, Keane, Snow Patrol and even Pink Floyd."
3,"Disappointing, with two exceptions","There's no accounting for taste--well, not mine at least. Blackfield's first album boasted some fantastic songs, the best of which I think were Aviv Geffen's. But I think Blackfield II is just not up to this partnership's potential, except for two--albeit glorious--songs.If Geffen and Wilson parted ways right now--today--we'd still have these two outrageously great tunes--""Once"" and the magnificent ""My Gift of Silence"". They're Wilsonian in reference, and in ""Silence"" 's case at least, completely fresh. They're so good that they overshadow what I find is the lacklustre (and in places unlistenable) rest of the album.I don't know what the future holds for Blackfield, but ""My Gift of Silence"" holds a warm place in my heart--lyrically and musically-- as Steven Wilson's must subtle and adult song--a song that's only really challenged by another new Wilson tune, Porcupine Tree's ""Time Flies"". If the album had to stand on ""Silence"" and ""Once"", it'd get a zillion stars."
4,"Gran disco, aunque.....","Buena continuación en el trabajo de Blackfield. Sin embargo, el disco hace demasiado énfasis en el lado melancólico, lo que para oídos acostumbrados al sonido de Porcupine Tree."
4,If you like melodic easy listening prog.....,"If you're a Porcupine Tree fan who likes the softer edge of the tree then I feel blackfield I & II will fill the bill. Shorter songs, good melodies and arrangements with some heavy guitars thrown in to pick up the mostly acoustic guitar, systesizer based songs. A nice easy listen even for those who don't usually venture into the catagory, Prog music, for their musical needs!"
2,"Need a ""pep talk""??","This book is most useful for those parents considering removing their child from public school. It is mainly a ""pep talk"" for undecided parents. I ordered this book with the expectation that it would provide useful suggestions on how to reach my ADD daughter. I was searching for information on HOW TO TEACH an ADD child. It does have some useful information here and there but the book did not provide the information I was looking for."
2,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this book with hopes of finding some information in teaching my ADHD son. I have been homeschooling for 3 years now and their ""start-up"" advice, although useful for others, was of no help to me. Most other books that deal with ADD/ADHD focus on children in the public school setting. I set out to find a book specifically dealing with homeschool children. This book is very deceiving in its title and I am saddened that the author would use ADD as a lure to get people to buy her book. Especially homeschoolers, who are often on a very limited budget to begin with. It should be titled, ""How to start homeschooling a child with special needs,"" and leave the ADD out of it. There are some very useful ideas for beginning homeschoolers, but if you are looking for ""specific"" guidance regarding ADD issues you will be very disappointed."
3,Too many ads,I expected more content from this magazine. There are so many medication advertisements in every issue.I am so frustrated with all the ads that I will not be renewing my subscription.
2,"So-so, not for my condition","As a longtime sufferer of osteoarthritis, I've picked up several issues of this magazine, hoping to find useful information to aid my recovery while waiting and preparing for bilateral hip replacement. I found the writing bland and the topics not of interest. I can see where the magazine would be useful for patients with RA and other conditions -- just didn't work for me."
3,"Articles are great, too many advertisements","I enjoy reading the articles but there are wayyyyyyy too many advertisements. I really wish magazines of this sort would stop advertising the many, many, many drugs out there for Arthritis. Those 2-3 page ads are in such tiny print I'm not going to read them anyway. Not to mention that I would never go to my doctor with an AD to request a medication. Reading real world articles from people who have tried various medications or double blind studies on the efficacy of medications, that would be swell. Advertisements? Just a waste of space.Personally I would rather pay a few dollars more a year and have more content and less ads."
2,The Best Vanessa Paradis Song ince TANDEM!,Commando is the best work to date! Same style as her second album but so much better!
5,Excellent book!,"I bought this book for my wife and she loved how it spoke directly to her heart. Excellent author, easy to understand, and the content makes you think deep."
4,A few flaws in an otherwise useful product,"I'm currently using the wrist rest to write this review, and it's providing decent support at my desk. If you are looking for a cushy rest that your wrists will sink in to, avoid this rest as the gel inside is firm and does not budge much with use. The rest slides around a bit over the course of a long day, but actually stays put better (due to its heftier weight) than some other wrist rests I've used.As wrist support is extremely important for someone using a computer for long periods every day, I'm pleased with the purchase as it's keeping my hands off the desk. It's also flat on one side (so it can be snuggled against the keyboard), but unfortunately the size of my hands forces the rest has to be pushed back a distance.Overall, select a rest based on how much 'give' you'd like. If firm is your style, buy this one. Otherwise, look at some of the other offerings on the site."
3,Average,"The gel pad is a little more rigid than I had hoped, as opposed to my mouse gel pad, which has a silky texture and lets my wrist sink in. It doesn't really fit to the contour of my keyboard (which is semi-ergonomic), but I got used to it after a week. Overall it's better than having no gel pad at all, although it's a little uncomfortable when playing games like stepmania. Like anything in life, you get what you pay for."
3,HD-DVD is better than Blu-Ray,"I own both an I had the chance to try the same movie for both formats in my 1080p capable HDTV, and I can assure you that HD-DVD is the way to go. Better picture quality, mor vivid colors and the audio sounds less compressed in the HD-DVD Player. And it's because Blu_Ray still uses the MPEG-2 while HD-DVD uses the VC-1 codec that allows for a better quality image and compression. Over the paper they sound like two similar technologies, but believe me, when you own both machines like me you will see that HD-DVD is the best format around. It should be the standard format without a doubt."
5,Flawless Video and Audio Quality,"I have owned the BDP-S1 for 2 days now. I can't stop watching Monster House. The picture quality on my 1080i HDTV is just spellbounding. I hooked it up to my Onkyo THX home theater in a box with an optical cable and the sound is crystal clear. This product really takes you to a whole new level. The visual clarity is like walking outside on a perfect blue sky day. I see no flaws in the image even with a 1080i TV. Really can't get better than this, at least hopefully not for a few years when I can convince my wife to let me upgrade again."
3,PS3 is a better buy over Blu Ray Players...Save your hard earned money!,After comparing the Sony to the Panasonic DMP-BD10 and PS3...for the price the PS3 won hands down...Also the blue front panel on the Sony is a total turn off. In my opinion the prices of all the Blu-ray stand alone players are way over priced compared to the PS3...and the Toshiba's HD DVD A2...you can purchase a PS3 20GB and a Toshiba HD-A2 for less than some of the Blu ray players...and the Toshiba can be bought for under $400 and puts out a awesome HD Picture...I feel the best buy would be the PS3 20GB and the excellent Toshiba HD-DVD A2. A blockbuster deal.
2,"First generation, and it shows.","We've got one of these in our office. It's slow - takes a very long time to start up, and is pretty unresponsive. Seems very finicky about disks with slight scratches. The ""eject"" button takes a long enough time to eject that you sit there wondering if you really ejected it and you hit it again, and it goes out about an inch and then goes back to tell you ""no you hit it before I just decided to register both presses at the same time"". Gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it actually plays disks and is basically functional, but I'd be upset if I got one for free (which I guess I kinda did). Looking forward to a 3rd or 4th generation version that's cheap, reliable, and more tolerant of scratches."
1,Over priced with low performance,this late in the format war I cant believe sony would release a player which doesnt even support the next generation audio formats i.e. TrueHD. It was my mistake to make an assumption that this player would at least be as advanced as the first generation of the Toshiba HD DVD playter. I now own both and can tell you with good conscience that if you want ot enter the HD era go with HD DVD.
1,DOESNT MAKE SENSE TO BUY,GET A PS3 60 gig version.. IT has this technology built right in plus u get the best gaming system on earth till 2011.OH YEA and buy a good hdmi wire from here.. i got one for 10 dallors and a 37 inch flatscreen from walmart hdmi hdtv.. u know the full deal.. and its emerson so its not a no name brand.. I hope this review is helpful to you
1,What kind of blue ray is this?,"I just seen the player this after noon at Best Buy and was really sorry about others' good comments about this player. I didn't have a chance to test the sound because I was so loud out there, but the picture, it was nothing to be impressed. I guessed it was a DVD upconvert at first. And after I asked the BB technician standing there I was so disappointed about Blue Ray. If this is all about blue ray, I rather buy a regular DVD player for Christ's sake. In addition, this player was playing through a Sony 40V2500 Full 1080p HDTV."
1,Sony Blu-ray stopped reading after 14 months,"Beware of Sony Blu Ray! There is a good chance it will die soon after the warranty expires! Most company's will extend the warranty if its within a month or 2, NOT SONY! Support is the worst in the industry! Very strange this happens more then the feedback states here on Amazon???"
2,Not ready for prime time,"Player has too many problems even after loading in the update discs. Things like: very slow startup, scan speed 1 usually works but forget 2 and 3, will just go into pause mode for no reason and you can't get it out without rebooting, etc. Very irritating machine, especially since it is relatively expensive."
1,Comapre withPanasonic first,"I have both Blu Ray players in my rig . The Sony is much inferior due to lack of gamma control , picture and sound quality is already not as good as Panasonic. the Panasonic has a built in scaler that is incredible. If you can compare chapter nine of Kingdom of Heaven on both players. The Panasonic can display tremendous color in dark scenes that just appear drab on Sony.I was disapponited because this is suppode to a ""Reference "" player. Get the upgrade for Panasonic before you view KoH. the sound is spectacular.Blu Ray is the format of the future . Spend your money wisely."
1,cheese,i bought this dvd pack....and i have watched them... and i am not happy.....quality is bad....i found i had to adjust my tv settings in order to get a clear image on most of the dvds...it seems more like home videos than a professional documentary....very sad because i was really looking forward to this dvd collection...
1,Very Strange...In a bad way.,"I was extremely DISAPPOINTED with this series. Most of the DVD's were so boring, I nearly fell asleep. An example of what I mean by ""boring."" Long periods of monotone, british accented, man speaking about the lives and deaths of people like Charles Dickens. About how his ghost ""might be walking the graveyard of a Rochester cathedral"" because that's allegedly where he ""wanted"" to be buried...but instead, they buried him at Westminster abbey...BOOOORRRRINNNNGGGG. Don't be fooled into purchasing these, thinking they will be the creepy stories that you see on Sci-Fi, History Channel, A&E or Discovery Channel. They are low budget and low entertainment value."
3,Ummm...Mixed feelings,Ok...The reason I have mixed feelings about this set is that there really isn't much about ghosts. It's more about the paranormal and less about ghosts. I found myself wanting to turn the channel sometimes because it was simply boring. The set would have been much better if there had been more ghosts and less of the other stuff.
4,This is a great CD,"I love Mike Rowland and have been a fan of his ""Fairy Ring"" for years. This was a little too similar to that to be all that exciting for me but I do like it and play it often."
4,the brighter side,"What happened to Mike\s previous cassette, The Brighter Side? It was the best relaxing music I have ever heard?"
1,Not so great!,I was disappointed in this product. While it did reduce the puffiness it leaves a white film under your eyes. I used several bottles and it always got the same results.
1,Dumbest impulse buy ever,"Sudden Change Eye Serum is a rip-off. You might as well stick rubber cement under your eyes for all the good it does. It's like a clear paste that doesn't dry clear. Not only does it do nothing for your under eye issues, it leaves a VISIBLE crusty streak on your skin as it dries. This is an impulse buy fueled by fear of getting older, and you don't need it. Learn from my mistake."
4,strangely affecting book,"I don't know why I picked up this book; I suppose it was because it's set in the past and most of my selections are present day. Almost in spite of myself, I found myself becoming engrossed in the lives of the Hawkes family, of Ben Joe and his sisters, his looney-tunes Grandma, and his reserved but strong-willed mother. It paints an exquisite picture of small-town Southern America in the early 60's. There's a lot more going on in Ben Joe's head than ever really happens in the book. It's a lot about what people let you see and what people try to hide. I enjoyed it. It makes me want to read more Tyler."
3,Anne Tyler's first book,"This is Anne Tyler's first novel (one she has disowned), and it definitely shows. Ben Joe Hawkes is a law student from North Carolina who is attending law school in NYC. He misses home and decides to return there for a visit. Home consists of six sisters, his mother, and his grandmother.We get lots of talk about past incidents, mostly of unusual doings (running off with salesmen, for example) that nobody seems to take too seriously. The book is fairly disjointed (in one scene a drunken soldier appears out of nowhere on their front lawn playing a bagpipe) and filled with lots of talk, much of it not very interesting. Much better work was to follow."
3,Her first and definately not her best.,"The author has definitely improved as a writer since she wrote this one. This is about Ben Joe and his family. Ben Joe is attending college in NY. He is studying to be a lawyer at Columbia. After learning one of his sister's has left her husband and moved back home, he feels compelled to go home for a visit right in the middle of a semester. Home is Sandhill, NC. The family of 6 girls and 1 boy (Ben Joe), Mom and Grandma, is quirky at best. Some of the interactions amongst characters in this book are just silly (for a lack of a better word). To me, this wasn't really a story that had a nice beginning and a happy, or at least concluded end. It was more like a picture in time that ended abruptly. Tyler has definitely developed as a writer, she is one of my favorites. I am glad I had the opportunity to read this book. It just isn't one of her best."
2,"IF Morning ever Comes, Anne Tyler",This must have been an earlier book of the author. The characters had little personality whichis not like her other novels. Really dull reading.
1,I thought I'd die of boredom!,"I hope the reviewer who said that Anne Tyler diavowed this book was right - it was a real snoozer! The characters were shallow, two-dimensional at best, and the pace was atrociously slow. I had to force myself to finish it, so I could give it a fair chance while discussing it at my book club meeting. Surely, even in the South in the era in which this was set, people had some feelings, some purpose in life, some rational thought processes that guided their lives. These characters seemed to have none of these. From Ben Joe (where was he from the time he finished college to the start of law school?) to his vacuous sisters, no character stood out as definable in my eyes. And how was it that Shelley could so easily go from one love to another, agreeing to marry someone she hadn't seen in years, and who proposed so hastily and half-heartedly? I wanted to change the name of this book to: ""If the End of This Book Ever comes, I'll Be Happy."""
2,When morning finally came...,"...Ben Joe Hawkes left his hometown as unenlightened about his family as he was when he arrived. On top of that, he's got in his baggage a new/old love, who seemed to be adding to his confusion. This story could have gone in a number of directions. Personally, I would have liked to know more about Philip Hawkes, Ben Joe's deceased father, through the recollections of his mother, grandmother, and Philip's mistress, as well as the relationships between the three women. Perhaps then Ben Joe would have shed some light on his past, and we as readers would have more light on him and his future."
3,Short read,It was a very short read. I enjoyed the story although I felt the characters could have been developed better. I read it as an ebook from my public library and found lots of misspellings/typos.
2,Not crazy about it!,"The book was written skillfully just didn't do for me what i thought it would do. ( did make my mind) I guess identified to much with the main character Ben Joe, a constant worrier."
4,wonderful,"I have had this lego since it came out and it is still in great shap it has many features, and has at least 15 droids. The doors open in the front by twisting the knob,but does not close by twisting in the opposite direction. The colors are all wonderful and it is very detailed. It is very sturdy."
3,Several pieces missing from box,"Not to sound grumpy, but for $300/set it would be nice if quality control would ensure that all the pieces came in the box. Further, after we found that pieces were missing there is no number, no contact information, that I could find by which you can get the missing pieces."
4,Grandson's 11th birthday gift,"I bought this as a gift for my grandson on his 11th birthday. He immediately started to put it together, and finished about 4 hours later.He loves to put things together and had experience with legos before. I think the pleasure of putting it together may outway the joy of playing with it. But when he got home and used it with the other similar legos I'm sure he is enjoying it. It is educational in the value of learning how to put things together and solve problems as well as organization."
4,Hard Pumping Goa,"This cd is one of my most expensive cd's in my collection, but still one of my favorites. The hard pounding Goa-Trance brings a new light to Goa music. If your a Goa Fan this cd is well worth the money!"
2,Not for beginners,"This would be a great reference manual, but I am using this test in my parallel processing course and the pseudocode is confusing and the MPI functions are introduced with poor descriptions."
1,Typical CS department book,I find this book to be poorly written. The examples are insufficient and the content is only a cursory introduction to parallel programming. My recommendation is to reaearch alternative publications relating to Parallel Programming.
2,A Mystery?,"I found this book very frustrating and hard to follow. I bought it along with a couple of other paperback mysteries and wish I hadn't paid the hardcover price! Try ""A Force of Habit"" for REAL mystery. This first time author did an incredible job keeping me guessing till the end."
3,Unfocused,"I am a big fan of Edgar Meyer and there are many pieces on this album that I enjoy. However, as an album, it lacks continuity and seems jumpy and inconsistent. The styles vary so much from song to song that it leaves you feeling a little unsettled. The other odd thing is that the break between each track is too short. How does this happen? They are so short that they feel like pauses in a song, but then you've moved on to the next song with a totally different feel and it feels a bit like whiplash."
4,My Fisrt Piazzolla,A very good cd whith the best of Astor Piazzolla. Easy to know a good player and compositor. Very good music
1,Scooby Doo Legend of the Phantosaur,"I was very disappointed in this latest Scooby Doo movie. They had Shaggy turning into a tough guy and using terms like ""kicking butt"" so I thought it totally inappropriate for younger children. They also had brawls and motorcycle gang fights, etc. I grew up on Scooby Doo and love how clean and fun the cartoon was and this was definitely not that. I was very disappointed that writers are taking characters that work well together to solve a mystery with clean language, fun spooks, and great 'monsters', and turning them into the usual Hollywood mess that is out there now. I do NOT recommend this latest Scooby Doo movie, stick with the Loch Ness mystery or the Pirates Ahoy, or Camp Scare for the usual fun mystery solving."
3,For older kids only,"While this book does present good information, it was way beyond the 2 year old I purchased it for. Some of its language was almost on an adult level. I would not recommend it for a young child."
5,excellent!,This book was a big help. I've ordered copies for friends who are pregnant and have children at home.
2,Too advanced for a 2 1/2 yr old,"Delivery was quick as always, but my low rating is for the book itself. This book was not what I expected. I have a 2 yr old and I think this was a bit advanced for her. I was not prepared for the whole conception thing to be described to her."
5,Very helpful in answering questions,"My daughter is four and we are expecting a new baby. As you may expect, she had lots of questions. This book was perfect for her age. I would recommend it for others with children in this age group."
3,"does not tell ""how the baby got in there"" exactly!","i found it when i was six years old. mom read it to me the night we got it. one sentence is:""daddy's sperm and mommy's ovum join together... like a jigsaw puzzle"". It did not tell me how the sperm got in and they come from. i never knew those things until i was almost nine.p.s. i reccomend it's so amazing and whats the big secret!"
1,Inappropriate,Definitely not for 2-5 years. It goes way too in depth for my son and he's 5. Words like sperm and vagina are too much for small children...
2,This book is over the top for preschoolers,"This book was recommended for the preschool age group but it is way too much information for that age group. My son didn't ask any questions about how the baby got in my belly so I didn't end up sharing this book with him. I'm not so sure I would have even if he did ask the question. ""When mommy and daddy want to make a baby, daddy puts his sperm inside mommy."" that quote from the book is pretty much what turned me off from wanting to share this book with my four-year-old."
2,Too much info/words for 14 month old,"I found this book at a discount book store and bought it without reading it. Should have read it first, my fault (it was cheap). It is way too lenghtly for a young child, read it to him for the first time at 14 months old. I realize it says 2-4 years old, but I thought it would be somewhat decent for my son. My son will be 18 months old when the baby arrives. We looked at the pictures and talked about them. I also paraphrased the wording and only read what I thought he could understand. Each section/question and answer has 50 words or more (sections are two pages long)."
1,Doesn't sell itself,"I don't like that the excerpt for this book only gives one page of text. I really can't tell what this book is about by one page or if it's appropriate for my 5-year-old who bores easily if it's not about him. The ""surprise me"" page is only an illustration. Rather frustrating. Because of this, I'll look for other books that give more detail."
3,"Excellent book, but not appropriate for toddlers","This book is best for age 4 and up, or whatever age at which you are ready to address ""how babies are made."" I quote from the book, ""Mommies have one piece, called an ovum. Daddies have the other piece, called sperm. When a mommy and daddy want to make a baby, the daddy puts his sperm inside the mommy."" We returned this book because neither my husband nor myself wanted to address that with our two-year-old."
3,An interesting book.,"I had read ""The Painted Bird"" by Jerzy Kosinski, before I read the biography by J. Sloan. ""The painted bird"" is a powerful book and I wondered about the author. A lot of things made sense to me after reading the biography. Sloan has written a very interesting book , but I feel that he has written too much of his own analysis. If Sloan knew Kosinski for about 20 years, there is no mention of a single event of that in the whole book. I found this kind of surprising, since the book is a memoir. In spite of all the controversies surrounding Kosinski, he is still a great story teller."
2,Sloan should have proof-read the manuscripts,"I grew up in Poland in the 70s and 80s and was unaware of Kosinski of that time. I was, however, aware of how the population felt towards the ""collaborators"", for example students who went on exchange programs to the Soviet Union.I personally was punished for refusing the obligatory field trips to the USSR throughout high school.While some people may see something good in collaborating with the enemy or doing anything to get ahead in life, I see 1 major flaw in this book: misspelling of Polish names, newspaper titles, names of towns. This may not bother Americans, but is annoying to a Polish speaker. This book should have been proof-read by a native Pole.I paid ... for the hardcover, and I consider it was a decent investment."
1,Don't buy iConcepts protectors,"Complaints about bubbling and scratching are absolutely true.Manufacturer's claim of no glare is patently false. The film is not matte but glossy, so there is more glare with this shield than without; to make matters worse, there is tinting that dims the display. Time to try another product."
3,"For tourists, not ""travelers""","Covers only the most popular tourist destinations and provides no coverage of cities one might drive through getting there. For example, Tampico and Monterey (!) are not even listed in the index. For covered areas, the emphasis is on the on the destinations popular with the fly-in tourist, while other major cities receive scant attention: Mérida, Yucatan's capital, has about the same number of pages as Tulum, a small Maya site easily assessable from Cancún. Hotel and restaurant coverage leans toward the upper end of the $ scale. Should be useful for the English-speaking tourist who wants to see something other than the beach (major archaeological sites are reasonably well covered), but is not useful for the traveler who might happen to arrive in Coatzacalcos (or any other non-tourist city) looking for a hotel and a meal."
1,Imitative at best,"Why was this book published? The premise--to rephotograph sites that Stimsom had already photographed decades earlier--is hardly original. Prospective buyers should be aware that this is really nothing but a coffeee table book, and it is substandard even for that genre. The rather mediocre photos are only loosely tied together by commentary that is hardly more than poorly written fragments. Even the used book price... is excessive, considering the paltry contents. Even compared to other works in the coffee table book ghetto, this one is surprisingly shallow."
4,Songs that taste good and are good for you!,"Great songs that have melody, big drums and loud guitars. 80's rock all grown up. Production is excellent on this album and the tunes are tastey and nutritious!"
2,Not a winner,"First of all, this was very overpackaged. I got a 12 inch x 9 x 4 box for a 4 inch tall product that wasn't even breakable.My main complaint is that, unlike the misleading picture above, the protectors dont cover the whole screen. I have about a half a centimeter gap at the top of my m130, and a small gap around the other edges. I suppose they could improve your handwriting, but all they do is make your stylus move slower. There are little bubbles all over the screen, and the credit card-like thing they give you to smooth them out doesn't even fit your palm correctly, and doesn't work well. In under a minute of writing, the screen was already very scratched up.Unless you are loosing sleep over your palm screen or having problems with people putting their fingers on it, I wouldn't recommend buying these (they are also very overpriced)."
3,The jury's still out ...,"10/31/07I just received these seeds in the mail & sowed them in some 8.5"" ceramic containers ... We'll have to see how they do.11/27/07The curly leaves are just starting to come out ..."
3,so sappy!,This book made me sick with the sappiness of it all. I like ms. bussey very much but I was very disappointed with this read.
1,"Good Name, Not Helpful",I really thought this book would be a little more helpful but it is vague and not very detailed.
4,Comprehensive,Covers many different kinds of uses of a treadmill. Mostly it just freed me up to find my own way.
5,Great for treadmill users,I found this to be a very informative book on a subject that has little available information. The author has done a good job of covering all of the specific needs of a treadmill runner. I especially like the various workouts that are designed for the treadmill. I would recommend this book for anyone that works out on a treadmill.
5,Cereal for Dinner,"What brave women we meet in this book! I feel like I know them now. I knew this would be good read for Moms with kids at home, but Cereal for Dinner has been good for those of us over 60 whose kids have been grown for a long time. Asking for help, speaking up,and rethinking long held beliefs. I am very glad to have read this book. I have bought and given many with confidence that anyone who reads this will appreciate Breese's powerful insights."
3,Menu Throwback,"The first thing I noticed about this DVD is that you don't have a choice to play the whole thing through. You get thrown back to the menu after each lick. So you need 3 hands to play along. One for the fretboard, one for the pick, and one for the DVD remote control.The instuctional aspect of each lick is good for the first several licks. Bruce plays each lick a few times at different speeds, and you get a nice breakdown of the fingering also. Toward the the end of the lick register, he plays each lick at tempo, then kind of slow with no breakdown, then ofcourse, back the menu we go; and now I can't even grab the remote fast enough to get the next lick before, low and behold, I'm back at the menu.Well, the licks are good anyway. Should have been called 50 Licks Remote Style. lmao"
2,Not as expected,"This dvd is not a bad dvd. There are some issues with each lick playing through & then having to go back to the main menu to repeat it or go to the next lick. The player on the dvd is very good, and I do like the way the earlier licks are shown slow & fast. What I don't like about the dvd is probably not a fault of the product, but a misperception on my part. I am a classic rock guitarist who has never played jazz before; I was expecting some entry level instruction along with the licks, which just is not there."
5,Mac,My Son Loves The Final Fantasy XIII For Play Station 3 That He Got For Christmas But He Opened On Christmas Eve
2,Damn I should have listened to the Negative Reviews,"I really should have listened to the negative reviewers. This game sucked. The story was way past kewl and I kept wanting to know what happened next and stuff. However, I didn't want to actually play the game to get there. I wasn't having any fun. The gameplay was just atrocious. I was forced to control characters I didn't like and watch as the computer (poorly) controlled the ones I did like. In fact my control was laudable. There was an ""autofight"" button that I had to rely on in order to maximize my battle score. Yes each battle is scored, meaning that the less time it takes to win, the better your rewards may be. Thus using the autofight button is almost required. It just took all the fun out of it. BTW, forget how much I disliked the gameplay, how is this a greatest hits in 2011 when it was released in spring of 2010? Why isn't prototype a greatest hit or mass effect 1? Well that was a waste of $20. I guess I'll just head back to ME2 and DA2."
1,"Slow, Slow, game","I'll be honest, I haven't finished the game.I have invested 30 hours into this game, and the story has not even started. I enjoy a good RPG, and I enjoy slow paced games, but this is stupid. And the leveling system is complex, with minimal instructions and explanations. Its possible to figure it out, but it was a terrible way to set up a leveling system. Combat is not great, but it can be fun (just don't plan on selecting which team members go with you, the storyline does that part for you).Maybe someday I'll try to finish it, but it left such a bad taste in my mouth, I think it will collect dust until the day I make it a set of coasters."
5,Another excellent delivery from the Final Fantasy Series,This is a great installment in the Final Fantasy series. The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay and system is fun. Doesn't have the openess and replayability of some like 7. But it is a solid delivery. The after main plot line games are ok but could be better.
2,terrible,This is the worst final fantasy game I have ever played you are led around don't get to free play and the characters suck it's a boring game don't buy rent
2,Final Turtle Fight 13,"I have been a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series since I was in grade school. I love the story, the characters and most importantly the planning and depth that goes into the combat in the games. This latest installment has barely enough of the first two to call itself by its own title. If you like farming (or killing over and over for items) then this is the game for you. In order to make your characters strong enough to kill the last extra boss you will be farming for over 40 hours. On the same enemy. With little to no drops most of the time. If you like being bored, buy this very linear one to two button game. If you like real Final Fantasy games, go buy VI or IX."
3,Good game,"Being to linear and not having great storyline, was the reason i didnt put 5 stars.Other than it was great. Characters and depth was awesome, but sometimes the storyline was too stupid and ruined the game, especially when it was getting intense.Intense is fine but when its like this, i think they're pushing for potential dramatic experirience from players, but i didnt experience the intense dramatic other than being annoying actually.II-X were awesome. But this one was ok, just a looooooot of battles. was fun but not great."
2,Not a lot of fun.,"I've played most of these Final Fantasy games but they just seem to be getting worse. There really is not much game play at all. You are pretty much forced to go in this path, then do that and so on. Pretty boring really. I think this one has done it for me with the franchise."
4,FFXIII,"the game is nice, it has its times that you have to do the same things over and over ""Fighting same style"" , but is fun at the end.I'm on the 20hr+ and enjoying it.Hoping the end is very nice."
2,Runaway as fast as you can,"So, whether you like Jrpgs or play Final fantasy series, this game will be on the bottom of your list. The worst part of this FF is the fact that its so linear. When my ps3 died and I realize I had to replay ff13, I decided to sell it.The reason why I sold it was:1. Its basically the same game every time you play it( especially the first 13 chapters)2. There is nothing unique about each characters( Similar sphere grids based on the class)3. Story was just ok.Many people didn't like 12 but at least in 12 I was playing the first same every time I start over. 12 did not hold my hands I could runaway open maps and talk to people in the city.Whats Missing from this game:1. Cities, World map, NPCs2. Replay valueI hated the weapons and armor system. The battle system was just ok. Music was great though. Square-Enix please stop holding our hands, don't dumb down jrpgs and bring back exploration. IF FF13vs gets dumbed down like ff13 then its probably multiplatfrom."
3,On Down The Line...,"I played this game over a weekend. Obviously I didn't play the WHOLE thing. I played it for about 12 hours total. When I was growing up we had games that we classified as ""on-rail"" shooters. Your imaginary character would be ""pushed"" down a ""rail"" and you had to shoot your targets. This game is too similar. I didn't think the linearity issue would be that big, but it was indeed a huge detriment to this game. You're pushed down a single path and battle enemies. That's it. There was no exploratory aspect whatsoever. The game seemed to be building to a decent story albeit not that original, but that didn't bother me. The battle system was extremly in-depth. A little too much for me. It seemed that after every other battle they were introducting a new aspect. This isn't the Final Fantasy I grew up with. It's much different. Perhaps Square should consider going back to their roots next time."
4,Love it. I am a FF fan.,"I love the game over all. I just hope for the future games that the story mode is not so linear. We need to go back to open worlds to spend some time doing side quest and stuff. I have hope in you guys Square-Enix, but for know you guys did a bad job with this game with the freedom to search the worlds."
1,NOT A VERY GOOD GAME,"Me, being new to the final fantasy series and hearing how famous it is i bought this game having high hopes that is was going to be fun, i was greatly disappointed. most games this generation have lots of game play and stunning graphics and great music. the music of final fantasy is just amazing, you'll be humming the tunes to the songs throughout your day. and the visuals are amazing, in fact it doesn't even sum up how perfect the visuals are. SADLY those are the only two good things about the game, the game play is fast an complicated but you can go through the game play by pressing x throughout the battle u don't really have to do anything. this being a role playing game is very story driven the main part of the game is the story SADLY the story is very crappy."
3,HD Romantic Drama emulating FFX,"Title pretty much says it all.The movies and sound is fantastic. But perhaps a bit much at sometimes.CG- Fight- CG- CG - fight- fight- fight- run in a line- CG- CG- Run- CG. You get the idea.If they were going for a ""Movie game"", try not to make the main charater kind of a b**** and Hope... All i can say about him is EMO.The fighting system is pretty nifty... about 4 hours into it. But at times it can be tedious. Case and Point- I will accept the whole ""leader dies= game over"" but at least give us the option to free roam the battle. Having 2 bombs in your grill casting a nice long self-destruct and my guys can't even move. lol weaksauce.I think the thing I dont like most is that the ""leveling"" is a more straight forward FFX, which I personally did not like.Bottom line:I think its safe to say ""Anyone who didn't like FFX won't like this game a whole lot"". Unless you like Chick flicks that is."
2,How the mighty have fallen...,"The last FF game I'd played was FF VII. I think that must be Squar Enix's crowning achievement. Things have definitely gone downhill from there, and XIII wasn't worth the plastic it was printed on. It has such a boring combat system, and boring gameplay. The open-world of FF VII was what I loved about it and that is very much gone. This is basically an extended dungeon crawl with cut-scenes between it.Visually and musically this is an amazing game, and I wish the gameplay matched. Sadly, it does not. Even the story had some promise, but I got so bored with the gameplay that I couldn't finish it."
2,Final Fantasy Fanboys - Prepare to be Disappointed,"As one who's played EVERY final fantasy, chalk this one up as a disappointment. In full disclosure, I favor the classic final fantasys such as FF4 FF6 and FF7. This one just doesn't cut it. Viewed without comparison, it's surely a good game, but is a disappointment considering its Final Fantasy title."
4,Great Game Not The Best,"I am a big fan of Final Fantasy for years, this game is not a bad game, has a solid story and allot of actions, i did like the new combat mode but there is some ups and downs with character changing as you dont just follow one story or upgrade one character, over all is a fun game that will make you play until the end as always has been with final fantasy, but still final fantasy 7 and final fantasy VIII was always my favorites. Enjoy"
3,Lackluster Game,Pros:Absolutely stunning graphics.Cons:Terribly linear story.Terribly linear world.Terribly linear level up system.Oversimplified combat.Systems in game don't make sense. I.e. Weapon upgrade system.
1,"Hate it so much, very disappointed.","I play RPGs because I enjoy the stories and the side quests/adventures you can go on before completing the game. If I wanted to play a game that has nothing but battles and prevents me from doing anything else I'd purchase something like COD or some other shoot 'em up game. The graphics are nice, but being interrupted with a freakin' mini ever few minutes is hella annoying ESPECIALLY since all you're able to do is battle, battle, BATTLE!I loved FF8,9 and 10...I don't understand why this crap was made and I am not interested in FFXII-2 either. Also, the characters SUCK! I can't stand Snow, but I detest Serah.Bring back what works, leave out what doesn't. If you're new to FF, you will probably love this crap. However, most loyal FF gamers should understand why this is crap and the level of awesomeness that has not been reached since previous FF games.Final note: 100% linearity is the most annoying thing EVER!"
1,What a total waste.,"So I bought this when it first came out, thinking that it would be another typically good Final Fantasy game. Imagine my surprise when I first started playing and discovered just what a piece of crap this actually is. This entire game has a mediocre storyline, pathetic linear gameplay, and characters that barely seem to develop at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ""GAME"""
3,"Yes linear, but kind of fun","The game is kind of fun, I really haven't gotten to play that much lately, and that might be because the motivation isn't really there like the other FF games gave me. The game I did notice is like one large hallway and you barely get to customize your party which really turns me off about the game. Other than that the cut scenes are pretty, but the story line is kind of dull."
2,Review,"Hi i just wanted to say that this game is a big disappointment, the graphics are great, as is the music, but the battle system one of the main components is horrible. There is a auto-battle button available at most times and it makes battles boring."
2,Honestly...,"Tired of game developers being forced to dumb down games based off the casual market. Square-Enix takes a beloved franchise and surgically removes practically all identifying characteristics. Your left with a boring husk that shares the name and technological prowess of the series with and action rpg mechanic. Boss fights are easy with only a handful of difficult ones to challenge you. Summons once again find little reason to exist (seems to be an issue since FF9). Music I actually loved, and graphics of course. The characters were actually pretty well designed but many do not have the development needed to make you care. By the end of the game your just so invested that you force yourself to complete to see the end, but your terribly bored. The combat is at first interesting but it becomes tedious and boring because its simply a race to staggger the opponent then quickly destroy them. Just disappointed."
3,"Story is good, game play bad. Ending Horrible!!","Wow, I am always a FF fan.I love all final fantasy games, but I have to tell you this game is kind sad.I just kept fighting and fighting, following the storyline.got bored so many times...the one thing that disappointed me the most was the ending.the ending only last about 2 minutes... wtf?I spent all these times to play this game and getting an ending that only last about two minutes?It was even sad or happy... it just wtf?I am so disappointed about this version....when will FF V.S 13 comes out!!!!!!"
5,Why so much dislike?,"I don't know why many people dislike this game so. I found it to be very enjoyable. Sure you have to get through the linear parts of the game to get to explore the rest of the world, but that is when the game opens up. I have played the other FF series game, FF3/6 so happens to be my favorites in the series, and the formula is still there, but has been changed around. Play this game without judgments that you may have seen or formed yourself before playing the game and you will get enjoyment from this game."
3,just boring,"The game is ok but the way they tell the story is so boring , the whole time i wanted to skip all the dialog and cutscenes , i didnt but i really wanted to. Graphics were ok too but nothing special. The audio was horrendous with crappy dialog and even crappier music and sound FX.GFX 3/5Audio 2/5Gameplay 3/5Replay 1/5"
3,not as great as i had hoped,i will keep it simple. this is a solid ff game with a rewarding battle system however it is not as immersive of an experience for me as some of my favorites from the series past. the story is not very good and the beginning of the game is just sad in my honest opinion. it's just poorly designed with an ungodly amount of cutscenes with little to no meaningful gameplay between them and it makes me wish they had just gotten some of the story out of the way in one long intro and then let the game unfold with a few less interruptions.i also wish they had started moving towards a more western rpg style of game. i've played games from bioware and bethesda now that have really changed my expectations and i wish some of my favorite older franchises would make the leap. this game just doesn't cut it for me i think they really missed the mark.
3,"Starts of slow, then it gets really good, then it gets boring.","The game starts off slow, but its understandable because they are trying to get you acquainted to the new battle system (which i really like). When the game finally picks up, it gets really good. I had a lot of fun leveling up my characters and the story was starting to get interesting.After putting about 30 something odd hours into this game, it was starting to get dull and tedious. Eventually it started to become a chore to play and it wasn't as fun anymore, because you're running around doing the same exact thing for hours with little to no variety."
3,Played every FF ever,"I have played every FF through and some multiple times. FF13 is not a terrible entry into the FF series but it is by far the worst of them all. They are slowly removing what it means to be called Final Fantasy. There is so much repetition in this game and unless you really understand the fighting mechanics some of the bosses can take 20-30 minutes to beat, not kidding. Having a complicated battle system is not what makes Final Fantasy, imo it is the story, a sense of wonder and exploration of the world/seeing what cool items & spells the town vendors have, a fun combat system and interesting characters. In any case if your an old school FF fan you might be dissapointed with FF13 but if you can get it used I would recommend it, if your bored."
2,Too much work to be a game.,"Played FF III(SNES), VII(PS1), X and XII(PS2). This is just plain too much work - and combining things without the least guidance is merely chance. the aprts are too abstract to understand why this goes with that, etc. And the boss battles are very unforgiving and leave you very frustrated. Die and restart until you figure out what you have to do differently to beat them. I still have no idea why I was able to beat the 2 Sisters! But I did, after 2 nights and 8 tries. And there are TOO many cut scenes. I feel like when I am just getting into the groove of the battle system, it stops and forces me to watch a cut scene...then go READ THE INCLUDED ENCYCLOPEDIA. READ! I will buy a book if I want to read - and I felt I had to read the stuff just to comprehend the convoluted story.Waited to buy and when I did, felt like I wasted my money. I was actually hurt that Square-Enix let me down. Played for over 12 hours and feel like I will not play it again."
2,Technically strong but leaves a lot lacking,"I like the battle system and graphics. If you go into this game with the mentality of a beatemup with a good story by action game standards you will have fun. Challenge yourself to get 5 stars on every fight and it's a good action game. If you want a story, interesting characters, and exploration look elsewhere. The level design is awful, you are travelling through a narrow walkway 95% of this game no exaggeration at all. There is very little story in the middle of the game, out of a 50 hour game only the beginning 10 hours and last 2 or 3 have anything happening. The characters annoyed me personally but that's very subjective, I know a lot of people liked them."
3,"Without doubt, the worst Final Fantasy I have played.","The Pros.Beautifully designed, completly over the top with great music. Exciting battles (for a while)ConsMind numbing, insanely repetitive, there's only one dynamic to the game (Kill, walk down a tube, kill, watch a movie, kill, walk down a tube), manipulative and sentimental when it should be emotional, doesn't really feel like a final fantasy, the game feels like it's being played for you half the time, etc, etc.i know the creators need to be allowed to experiment with the format, but why do this to it. At best, something like this should've been done with a FF spin off. Why get rid of the towns, the side quests, the card games, the little curiousities, etc. Why would you do that. The wonderful areas that you go through, litteraly abstract into virtual nothingness, it feels like you're going down a tube that changes colours. That is all. Not that you're on a spaceship or whatever, just that you are surrounded by colours."
2,Mediocre at Best,"I had looked forward to this for a while. I was ecstatic when I got it, and utterly disappointed when I played it. From my perspective, it was all eye candy and little substance. Where are the sprawling cities with neutral characters? Why does my hand have to be held through so much of the game? Why so serious all the time? The characters in the final fantasy universe have never started out so dry and uninteresting as the ones in this game. I prefer the battle system of FFX over the real time battle system employed here. Everything has been streamlined, which in my opinion takes the depth and fun right out of the game. Maybe it is because I am older and some of my imagination has left me, or maybe it's because this is a dismal effort of a game. It has the name going for it and everything else about it is hollow. The developers need to return to their roots. To sum it up, FF13 is polished eye candy with mediocre story and gameplay."
4,Not disappointed at all!!,"Great Graphics/Story.Fast pace fights.The game really begins at Chapter 11.The ""Retry"" function when you die or during combat makes the game a bit too easy to me, and therefore makes me wonder why there are so many save points..I would have liked more control on some scenes of the game instead of just a beautiful cinematic.. without mentioning which one to avoid spoilers.But I have a lot of fun playing this game as I had during the 5 previous issues."
3,Interactive Movie,"I'm disappointed with FF yet again. The last release was too automated for my taste. 13 is just rediculous with it. It is an interactive movie. You do little more than press x. They need to take a step back to FFX and give the user a little more control, choice, and stuff to do on the side."
4,WTF Japan?,I love games but after i turned 11 it seems japanese games just dont make sense after you hit a certain age i love the combat (i cant remember how the other games worked after all these years).The stories dont make sense the characters can be annoying as hell at times (just a warning the hope kid will make you go crazy listening to him whine for 40+ hours)combat 4/5story 2/5characters 3/5 (lighting is awesome)overall 3/5
4,I enjoyed it...,"As I am probably the 600th or so person to write a review on FFXII, I'll probably get buried on page 8 or so but I needed to write one considering this game is alot better than some people think.Personally, I love this game. I ended up putting in about 150 hours and after you get your characters fully developed the game really opens up as far as paradigm options go. Leaving a better oppertunity to slay those near impossible enemies that the FF series is notorious for having... I wish there were more or those enemies, though, to be honest.Certianly not a game that is worthy of a 1 or 2 star review, that's for sure...4/5 stars to Square Enix. (Don't believe the hater's hype, or lack-there-of)By the way, I've played almost every game in the Final Fantasy series. Including 11 and 14. FF7 will still always be the best game ever made!"
1,Worst Final Fantasy to Date,I have never been so let down for a video game before. I had such huge expectations for this game. I'll try and not repeat what others have said. This game is so bad it makes X look good. XII was 10 times better then X. Seems like PS3 developers are focusing to much on graphics instead of game play. This games sucks. Bring me back VI and VII.Deal Breakers-1. No towns2. No world map3. Not being able to control each character4. Vanille's sounds5. Lack of equipment6. Linear exploring7. Story8. Kid-ishLoved-1. Graphics
2,I Miss Square Soft,"I don't understand what their trying to do with the game play in these recent Final Fantasy games but I can't say its good. I for one didn't enjoy pressing the X button several thousand times in a row and holding forward for the 48+ hours of ""Game Play"". Ok the game is beautiful and sure why not the story isn't that bad either I guess. But its not fun in any way."
2,Worst Final Fantasy Game in the Series.,"The Good:+It's a Pretty gameThe Bad:-Extremely Linear Gameplay, no Exploration at all-horrible story-highly annoying cast of characters-Boring Battle System, it takes no skill-Major Grindfest-A.I is stupid-Animation is iffy-Plot of the game is boring-5 Years of DevelopmentNote: Will go into detail later, i finished this game a long time ago but feel like posting my thoughts here as well on Amazon.com to help Amazon gamers avoid quite possibly the worst game in the series, up there with XII and XIV."
2,Disappointed and still finished the game.,"I had great expectation of this game as this is the 1st FF game for PS3. FFVII game for PS1 and FFX for PS2 are my 2 favorite. Good story and nice combat system.As for FFXIII ......Story:The main issue of the story is it is too narrow. Just some random events happened among 6 persons + several relatives of them. My facebook network is more interesting than this. Who is the villain? The priest-like guy I can't even say the name? I know all FF is about saving the world. But this is one of the weakest. Better than XII though.Combat:Just too easy. Libra, chain, stagger, attack, heal, chain, stagger attack, heal,..... Is this a math pattern problem for my grade 1 son? You only control 1 person also. I don't remember I need to specify any interesting command except couple charater based special move. Summoning is joke as it is so weak.I gave 2 star just because the graphics are good and I don't want to look stupid playing a 1-star game for 60 hr."
2,"Awesome in graphic, bore in game play.","I played this game until chapter 12 (13 chapter total) and I can't continuous to play because it is too boring.Good:1.Very beautiful graphic. The cut scene is awesome.2.Lightning voice is very good in English version.3.The new battle system works well.4. The strategy guide is very beautiful.Con:1. the story is boring. I like the ff7 and ff10 better. The graphic is beautiful but missing a good story behind2. The game play is too simple. Basically, you just keep moving forward. Keep hitting the ""x"" button during the battle. You might need to change the battle mode once a while. Imagine you keep doing this for 60-80 hours.3. After you win the game, you use your point/experience to build up your character. Upgrade the character takes lots of extra time and effort.4. Over all, the game has no surprise in storyline and the game play is just too boring. You just repeat to do the something until the game finish."
1,Worst saga game ever,"If you rate the movies it will be 5, for this is the only thing that the creators took care of!.. the games is F""#"" repetitive, no option to move freely and you can get stuck many times. The ""magic"" is not controlable, you have to wait and see what the CPU wants to fire. I just stop playing this game. I thought that when you advance you will be able to do more things, but the game doesnt offer any fun. This is a WASTE of time. im not willing to play more final fantasy crap unless it ill come to me free!!!.... We paid so much for this awfull game and is not PS3 worth it!!..."
1,not as good as its predecessors,its hard to start on this game but the main issue i have is the lack of story and what little there is to it is very difficult to understand and get into. the gf/eidolon fights later in the game are way to difficult with the only two people available at that part of the game. way to much upgrading you have to do for each class for every character. if the party leader gets ko'ed then you start over from the last checkpoint or replay the fight. the only upside to ff13 is the graphics and that it. this is not a final fantasy in my book and it just uninteresting
5,Great Fun game,"I had been an Final Fantasy Fan since FFV. What should I said? All Series of Final Fantasy are so interesting, and FF13 is, too."
4,Good game,"Fun Final Fantasy game although a bit linear unlike FF games of the past, graphics are beautiful as is expected from FF as well as great music and voice acting."
1,Hard To Take In,"The excellent graphics, experimental music, and surprisingly good voice talent don't compensate for the game actively wrestling away exploration, experimentation, investigation, or really any kind of variable gameplay from you.The story's a sham. Characters are poorly written, willing to drop three minute speeches about promises or friendship, hammering in the most obvious of story points while pretending to have anything close to believable emotions. It is -embarrassing- to be within earshot.To sum it up, the game's technicolor stupidity will give you a headache."
5,It's Final Fantasy.,"I don't understando why people think that the Final Fantasy series should be only copies of FF3 or FF7. Those are great games, indeed, but they are were they are because they try and did somenthing new. And so does FFXIII. The game has gorgeous graphics, an ok soundtrack and the fighting is extremely fast paced!I really liked this game. Does it have its faults, yes. But there are MANY other great things that will make you enjoy the fantastic story it has to tell."
3,Conflicted,"I would rent this game before buying! If you are an big ff fan, like me try it out first.I have to say the graphics are by far the best I've seen in a ff game yet. It is a very visual beautiful game.However, I think they kinda forgot about the quality of the story. I felt the same way with ff12, great music, graphics, etc. But the story itself lacked that sense of being apart with the characters. I know I may be wrong to some fans, but for me I got attached to the characters of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.My Husband plays it more than I do. I don't hate this game, It's just missing a few parts to put it all together story wise.I am crossing my fingers for Verses to be like the past games.Don't hate, I did you tube the ending of 13 and I liked it.I don't mind to watch the cut scenes when my husband plays it. Overall, rent it and form your own thoughts. Thank ff fans! xo~"
2,1st 10 hours of FF XIII are really DULL--- by kaji,"This review applies only to the first 10-12 hours of play. If you like to explore expanded areas and have some fun, with some timely fights, don't expect to get it with this game. I don't know what happens later, but for at least 10-12 hours you spend walking a crooked line in a canyon fighting bad guys every ten steps. Other than the start of a basic story with some nice cut scenes thats it. If it takes this long to teach you a new fighting system, then what does that tell you. Since I forked out the bucks I will continue, but if I were you I would rent or borrow from a friend. God,I hope it gets better."
2,Graphics vs. real RPG experience,"In all honesty what we have here is a game that is visually stunning with a dumbed-down combat system. Character development is minimal at best, vastly reduced from the other previous FF's. This game is neither challenging or fun, just button pressing, walk, video and repeat. It's seems all the genres now days are about making something as visually amazing as possible with no substance along the same lines as half of today's movies. This game is great for a kid say 14 and under."
2,( 7.5) Review - Final Fantasy 13 - A REPETITIVE CHORE - Rental.,"If you like to do the exact same thing fighting 1 boss guy for 7 or 8 hours and starting over again and again, then this is the game for you.One of those games where the more you play the worse your weapons get, the more thousands of times you have to hit the enemy AI.Its a straight line of annoyance! I liked it at first but i don't have the time in the day to spend 12 hours hitting something over and over.."
4,A fine addition to the Final Fantasy Legacy.,"FFXIII is a great game,looks beautiful but held back slightly by being forced to choose from preselected attack patterns. I highly reccomend this game."
4,Final Fantasy 13 Short Review,"Final fantasy 13 has been a sought out game for such a long time and when it first game, my first impression was it looks so beautiful. However, as everyone says it is linear, so... sooo sooo linear. THe story is satisfactory, and the only standing out part really is the battle system. FF13 is a good buy, but dont expect it to be another FF7 or FF10."
1,final fantasy XIII,this game sucks big time thay totley droped the ball on this one. been a final fantasy fan from the start. and thay f&%$#@up on this one big time. waste of my money and time. dont be fooled by the good reviews. this is not final fantasy. its crap. use in the bathroom to wipe your but. if you are like me and dumbenofe to waste your money on this game. totle let down.
1,More like a movie than a video game,"I like to actually play video games, interact with them via a controller... with Final Fantasy 13 you can start up the game and do other things, I'm ""playing"" Final Fantasy 13 as I write this in fact! Wow, I am able to be much more productive at doing other things with this video game. I cooked dinner and they even will fight without you.... you just have to occasionally toss your team mates a potion so they don't die and you'll get a 5 Star rating on your fighting skills!They should have made this game in a similar style of FF10, that game had a good balance between game play and videos... but this one has just been totally taken over by videos to the point where I just do other things until it's time to fight something. Just boring."
2,Final Fantasy,"This game was very disappointing. I am an avid Final Fantasy fan. The graphics are nice, however, it doesn't make up for the lack of story that Final Fantasy used to have. I couldn't even finish the game due to lack of interest."
3,Decent game.,I am a huge FF fan and I waited for a long time for this game to come out. For the most part I wasn't too disappointed. The game is beautiful the plot is engaging and the characters memorable. The combat system is fun and the paradigm system gave the game a really great dimension...Which almost distracted from it's tedious linear game play. The game plays like a train on tracks. It hurtles towards the end and only the scenery changes. Whether or not the destination is worth it is really up to the individual playing it. I have played through it completely and won't bother to go back through and try to get any of the trophies that I missed.I went ahead and played FFIV(again) after I finished this and found it to be way more engrossing and satisfying.My final rating is 3 stars. As far as console RPG's go these days it's not too bad. But I think I will stick to the PC for RPG's.
4,Best since final fantasy 7,"This game is great. The story is very linear but there are opportunities to go do other stuff after beating the last boss (in fact, you still have a lot to do after beating the game). The fighting system is cool, placing emphasis on strategy rather than selecting your specific actions."
3,"Good, but disappointing at the same time","I really like the story, and there is strong character development here, but the game is lacking a bit. The problem is that the gameplay feels a bit stale and repetitive at times. I do enjoy the battle system, though."
5,An Amazing Game,"Final Fantasy XIII has to be one of the most amazing games i have played on the ps3. Before you play it, you definitely have to know what you are getting ready to play, since the game gets increasingly difficult, and plan ahead with stratagies and your character stats. I highly recommend this title to fans of Action RPG's and newcomers to the Final Fantasy series."
5,Awesome,"I've played final fantasy games since I was a kid... Granting the gameplay is different, but the graphics, engaging storyline and characters is simply awesome!!!"
2,I want a back to basics FF!!,"Oh Final Fantasy, how did you get so lost? You lost track of yourself!This game is just borringly linear, starts so god-damn slow that bores you to death for a long lenght of the game... Battle mode, level-up grid and everything is just bad. Especially to a game with the history of the Final Fantasy series."
2,For 13 and under,"The FF franchise seems to be targeting younger and younger gamers, the T rating on this game is an overstatement by far. If you have children this might be a good RPG for them to start with. If you are a lifelong FF fan from the Nintendo era, this will disappoint you greatly. I will admit freely that I was not too fond of 11 or 12 of this series either, it just seems to be losing the character development that other RPGs have, notably Fallout New Vegas. This game should be classified as a game-movie as you are really just playing a level to watch a movie more than you are fulfilling a role. I will not be buying anymore from this series, sad to say. I miss the Moogles"
5,More Final Fantasy!,I thought FF13 was a really good game. I was introduced to the game at my friend's house. After that I really wanted to buy it. If you are alittle unsure about purchasing FF13 I would recommend borrowing it from a friend or renting it.
3,First in the series to not be as great....,"Final Fantasy XIII, by far, is not only an extremely repetitive and linear game it does not match the great story telling its predecessors do. The story begins with a spark of interest and continues through the entire first part of the game. After that it begins to slow down, severely, and the next 25 hours follow the same concept: get from point A to point B. After that the game offers some free roaming but it comes too late in the game that you literally feel drained at that point. Overall I'm hoping Versus 13 will be a lot better."
2,FF13 Fall from grace,I dont think the creators of this game spent enough time on the gameplay. The music is good graphics are great but the game itself sucks.
3,Too much change?,"The game utilizes a new style that doesn't use numerical levels, you no longer have strength, stamina, magical etc. attributes to contribute to but a crystarium of skills and spells. The battle system has changed quite a bit but I don't want to spoil it for you. The game arrived as promised, used and in good condition and I'd probably buy from this seller again."
3,Awful.,"Gameplay: Mediocre (not as good as previous iterations)Presentation: Superb (great music and visuals)Narrativ: Awful (characters, plot, dialogue all cringe-worth)"
2,They forgot the game.,"1. Push cursor down to autofight. Click X.2. Repeat for 1 minute if done3. If health low, hit L1 and switch to heal for 5 seconds.4. Win fight.5. Move main character forward. If fork in the road, go towards treasure first. Else, goto #16. Repeat for 20 hours.To keep you from throwing the disc away, half the time you watch beautiful if inane conversations between cartoon teenagers. They have better dialogue in the average sitcom."
2,worst Final Fantasy Ever,"now don't get me wrong the graghics are outstanding but the game play is single minded and the games AI has to be dumber than a 5 yr old. you have no control of your other team mates and little control of your own chericter. i want my money back, it took them 4 years to make this? they should have worked harder and they obviously think little of how the possable inteligence some of there gamers have..."
2,"Great graphics, but gameplay lacks","This game was a huge disappointment. I am a fan of the Final Fantasy series, but this game just flat sucks. The gameplay is reduced to hitting x as fast as you can and occasionally changing paradigms with L1. I never thought a Final Fantasy game could be classified as a button masher, but this one is. The gameplay is too linear. There is very little variety. There are no towns or npcs to interact with. Overall this game disappoints in every aspect except graphics. I would not recommend this game to anyone. I liked FF12 on the PS2 better than this game."
2,Not my thing,"I like RPGs, Mass Effect 1 and 2, Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Dragon Age, and most recently Skyrim are amongst my favorite games ever, so when i choose to try out FF i was expecting something very different, just walk, fight (mostly pressing x) and walk again and fight again, and if you turn back the same enemies are expecting you. After around 10 hours of this i decided to give up and made the decission that this game was not made for me.The game is beautiful, is the best thing it has, the graphics are amazing, the enviroments and model all look great.Its too bad, i was starting to get interested in the story, but the repetitive gameplay made me quit."
2,Woulnd't purchase,"I used to love playing Final Fantasy games. We recently bought a PS3 so I thought it would be a lot of fun to play. There are way too many movie clips. Maybe I have just been on PC games too long but the experience of playing this game is like trying to play a movie. Even though you can skip most of them, it is a very linear game (run from one end to the other) with cut scenes and movies on both ends. I gave up after about 2 hours and am not sure I will pick it back up."
3,Final Fantasy XIII,Always been a big fan of the Final Fantasy games but this one to me seems to be a big let down. Not what I thought it was going to be.
2,DVD level game,"...title says it all, this is not a true Blu-ray level FF game, a true Blu- ray HD gen console FF game would have had to consist of at least 2 full Blu- ray discs...or 50GB plus, but that would have meant 6 DVDs for Xbroke DVD player, or dumb it down for Xbroke. So, they dumbed it down in another way to fit on Xbroke, they scaled the entire game back to fit on 3 DVDs yet keeping the graphics fairly equal on both systems, if they had made a true Ps3 level FF they would of hadvto dumb the Xbroke version down to PS2 level graphics to make a much longer game fit on 3 DVDs."
1,If you like Final Fantasy DON'T buy this game.,"The game is a disgrace to the Final Fantasy name. The only thing good about it is the graphics. It's bad enough that the gameplay is so linear and simplified but the story is even worse. All of the characters are a bunch of crying fags, the summons are freakin' transformers, the first one is Sheva which is a transforming motorcycle, the next one is a transforming pony, and it only gets worse as you keep going. Final Fantasy X was the last final fantasy. The folks over at Mistwalker are shaking their heads at this crapy company ruining their masterpiece, Sakaguchi must be disgusted. If you're looking for a strategy rpg than pick up Resonance of Fate. And if you're looking for Final Fantasy you're gonna have to buy a 360 and pick up Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, or a Wii and wait for The Last Story to come out."
2,"bad music, story killed the game",I've played many of Finals fantasys.. but this one is the worst. ..Pros:1. Great graphics.2. Good battle system.3. Good character designs. (graphic)cons:1. sick and tired of just pressing X thru out the game(movie).2. Just way too freaking much of talking. talkin. talki. talk. tal. ta. t. .. in this game3. the story suck big ballz. Fal see? fail seed? fal sea? fal C? wtf???4. music is worst than any RPG music you can find. (Where's nobuo uematsu)
1,Disappointment and then some,"What was Square-Enix thinking when they decided to sit down and create this RPG?!? I can understand 2 maybe 5 hours of tutorial linear crap, but 25 hours worth?!? They should have made it more open and indepth from the start."
2,"Visually stunning, boring plot _and_ gameplay","Just played through the first chapter, or rather I watched the first chapter. It was hard to tell even what was going on during battles because the screen was so busy. Story was not compelling at all. Characters were overly childish for a war situation. Battle was basically just mashing the same button over and over again. I've played nearly all Final Fantasy games and absolutely love them, but this one is by far the worst of them all. I mean it's graphically intense and visually stunning, but just an awful game."
2,SubPar,"I'm a big fan of the Final Fantasy series. Most of their games are very good to great. This is not one of the great games. It came out with so much hype and great reviews that I was excited to play it. I gave up on the game after 5-10 hours. Pass on this game. The audio is really annoying, and the game-play changes detract from the fun. It sounds like FF14 is a dud as well..."
3,Horribly Average,"This game has some really great things going for it. Obviously it's gorgeous, obviously the battle system and the way that you increase the strength of your characters is new and interesting. What can I really say about this game that hasn't been said already. **************SPOILER**********Okay it's linear and after you finish the last boss you then gain, in a wth moment, the last tier of strength. The fact that you can then go back and complete these extremely hard mini-bosses seems like an unfortunate afterthought. My only thought that could explain this game is that they knew they'd be releasing a completely non-linear FF later this year and so decided to create a frustratingly linear game. Overall a good game to play through that will give the player some frustrating moments but overall completely unreplayable with a lot of the charm previous entries in the series had being completely lacking."
3,To much grinding and not enough freedom...,"I am pretty well disappointed. Have to grind for hours for the upgrades, which are ridiculously complex to figure out. And the game only pretends to be open-world, and doesn't pretend very well. I rarely forgot I was just ""playing"" a game... no immersion, no loss of myself in the story... just another game.I am looking for a first-person, role-playing, open-world experience where I can become someone else for a while... and this game could not deliver.It is a good game otherwise... and I am sure there are many people who love this style of game. It is beautiful and exciting... just unable to convince me.I won't be buying anymore Final Fantasy titles."
1,Worst FF Ever,"This game has chosen to take away everything that has defined it for the last 20 years..... which is the ROLE PLAYING. This is no longer an RPG. Its just a turn based arcade fighting game. The story is typical cheesy anime JRPG stuff, its weak compared to previous FF games. People are being taken over by some sort of magical force and turned into zombies or something but its mostly incoherent. I don't mean cool George Romero or Resident Evil zombies either. You basically cannot explore at all. You cannot even fight as more than one character or organize your party when in combat. The music falls flat compared to FFX which had the best soundtrack and I still listen to. Imagine if a Grand Theft Auto game took out the ability to freely roam the city or experience the game how you want. That is pretty much what Square Enix did to this game."
1,Misleading and Disappointing,"I'm going to make this short and to the point. First of all I haven't seen a game this linear since the Mario Brothers. Second of all you can't level grind. They constantly put temporary ability and attribute(strength,magic,ect..)caps. You unlock as you go. Third of all the story is ok, but not Final Fantasy deep. At least not compared to its predecessors. I was very disappointed with this game. I don't consider this an RPG. That's why I consider this to be misleading. It's more like an action/strategy(Dante's Inferno, Devil May Cry) except with turn based combat."
2,Not like I remember,I used to love Final Fantasy 10 years ago. Too old for this teenage arcade-comic stuff now. Thanks for the history FF...OVERRATED...
1,a review only for true RPG fan,"This is a horrid game galavanting around as a RPG, let alone final fantasy, one of the best RPG series ever created. This game has no exploration, no choice control, no individuality, you can't even interact with NPCs! If you don't know what a NPC is then this game may be just what you're looking for. If this game did not have the title of Final Fantasy then perhaps it could be enjoyable. Having such a name dishonors all the great gaming which came before this abberation! You can't control party leader, give commands, or freely explore. My apologies for the rant, it is such a shame that this ONCE great franchise has fallen to such lows. Stay away those looking for a RPG experience. This is a CG movie of epic proportions interspersed with a few button presses from you, the ""controller;"" when I say few I do mean FEW."
3,It is only an interactvive movie,"I was so dissappointed in this rpg. I have'nt liked where square enix has been going with there rpg's. This is more of just an interacive anime. Dont get me wrong is was the best graphics i have ever seen in a game, but that was it. The game play sux."
1,Horrendous,"This was one of the most boring games i have ever played. I was so excited for FF13 and then i started to play it. Wow, was i sad after that. I haven't even gotten to the half way point in the game and ive had the thing since its release date. Not worth the money, the time, or the effort. Very frustrating."
1,Overrated,Tried this Final fantasy game after hearing all the hype. I will say to you that this game is overrated for sure and boring. The game play is downright awful and I am not sure what people see in this game.
3,"Final Fantasy XIII, great game","First of all, Amazon has to be more specific in the item description since the picture of Final Fantasy XIII is the 'original' version, and the one I got was the 'greatest hits' version. If I knew this was the version I was getting, I wouldn't have bought it because of the red color the case has. I just don't like it :(And second, this is another Final Fantasy game. It's just great! The gameplay, the cinemas, the battles, everything is fantastic."
2,A terrible disappointment,"The story is terrible, the characters are unlikeable and the gameplay has no substance. The game is incredibly linear and basically all you do is walk and fight things. And fighting consists of selecting ""Auto Battle"" over and over again and hitting a single button a lot. There is no real game here."
4,Fun playing the game,"I always buy my games at amazon because they are shipped to quickly. Final Fantasy X111 is pretty fun, I still have a ways to go before I'm finished. I haven't got stuck one time as of yet, I hope I don't but I probably will. Anyway it is fun trying to find my way out to get to where I need to be."
2,Couldn't Get Past the Beginning,"I was really looking forward to playing Final Fantasy XIII when I first got my PS3 but almost immediately I realized this game was not going to provide the experience I was hoping for. The battle system starts off as beyond simplistic, the ""world"" is just one long corridor and the characters alternate between being either bland or annoying. I hear the game gets better eventually, a friend of mine swears things really pick up after about 30 hours of game-play. I don't have the time or energy to slog through 30 hours of unenjoyable game-play to get to the good part. I can say, however, that the game is absolutely beautiful to look at. The non-corridor areas you see are spectacular and the character models are fantastic. As pure eye candy the game succeeds, but I'm more interested in games that don't take so long to open up."
4,FF 13,"love how it was shipped fast beat the game in week enjoy the stunning graphics not so much about the story lol half way of the game i barely know whats going on terms of nam e and plot is so complicated but overall it was fun something new all time fav ff 7, 8 , 10 good battle system awesoem story line"
4,Its Good Once you get the Hang of it.,When you get use to the battle system and how the rest of the game flows then playing is pretty enjoyable. The graphics are good love voices and characters are great. But most of all I like the Eidolons I love how they can fight with you in battle and even change into horses and motorcycles( Haven't gotten to far into the game yet.)Overall The game is a good investment and a must buy. ^_^
2,Steaming pile of overprived poo,"FF13 features a 20 hour tutorial that while your inside of it you cannot pick your char or your team, makeing this 1 of many downdides of the game. By the time you past the tutor you arnt left with nearly enoughf game to make the experience worth the price, add to that the fact that this is a very linier game based on one of the weaker FF worlds and all and all you have just spent $50 dollers on a game that you would hae gotten $20-$30 dollers value from. My advice is that if you are a fan of the FF series wait for the prive to drop, youll be alot happer with your gameing value and experience."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"I somehow managed to push myself through 9 chapters of this game. How? I have no idea. I will say that the thought of playing it once more feels like going to the dentist. This is EASILY the worst Final Fantasy ever, and also just a plain bad game regardless of the Final Fantasy title.Here's what's good in this game: Graphics, voice acting, some of the music.What's bad? Everything else. It is not fun, the story is not interesting, there is no sense of a world since you just appear in new areas magically and nothing is connected, the battle system is for a 5 year old and beyond boring, the characters are lame, the lack of anything to do other than walk forward in a line and fight is pathetic and the upgrade system is completely worthless. You can beat this game without upgrading 1 item at all, without a problem."
1,Don't waste your time,"I've been a long time fan of Final Fantasy and I was utterly disappointed by this installment of the franchise. Beneath a glossy package of superb graphics and good voice acting is a very linear, tedious game. The story is mediocre and it's often lost by the grinding you're inevitably going to have to do in this game. It's certainly not an easy game to master. I was also extremely disappointed by the score for the game. The music is not up to par with previous installments of the franchise and is instead too pop. While this game shows promise in a few places, the cons are far too rotten for me to say this was a mediocre game. It was a waste of my money and I don't recommend it to anyone."
2,Linear trainwreck,"I am a HUGE final fantasy fan, and have been playing them ever since FFIV. This is not final fantasy. It is painfully linear, with boring and tedious combat.Here's a sample of gameplay: Run in a straight line. Get in a fight. Continue on your straight line. Get in another fight. Keep going on the same straight line. Maybe see a cutscene. Keep going on the same straight line...I am returning this immediatly, what a total waste of money."
2,"Long, Boring but beautiful","So to sum this up as short as I can. This is a Beautiful game with lackluster story, annoying characters, and bad voice overs. There was a point in this game where every 10 min of game play there was a 3 min video that accomplished nothing. I saw a preview the other day for this game and their big line is ""The battle within begins"". I agree with that line completely. I battled with myself for days trying to find the desire to finish this game. I would not recommend this game to the majority of gamers. Stay away and wait for something worth while."
2,My 1st Final Fantasy Disappointment,"Well, I've been waiting for this game for a very long time, however, it just didn't pay off for me. Can I just say, that I really tried to like this game! I have been playing Final Fantasy since I was a kid when the very first Final Fantasy came out on the original Nintendo. While, the characters and story and graphics are amazing... the battle system just kills the game for me. I know that Final Fantasy was probably trying to appeal to a new demographic, and perhaps the series has left me behind. I have tried over and over again to like this game, I just can't get past the ""over and over"" battle tubes... I feel like this game is just one repeat after another. I just wasn't able to keep interest in the game. For the first time, Final Fantasy has disappointed me, and for the very first time, I won't complete a Final Fantasy game. I wish Final Fantasy would go back to their roots."
1,This is not final fantasy,"Between the butchered battle system and making the game accessible to the ADD-FPS crowd the game is all style and no substance.The story is not intriguing, the battle system is tedious and exploration hardly exists.Save your money because unless all you care about is graphics there isn't much to like here.Its funny I used to be this hardcore square fanboy and I've now watched the Final Fantasy series spiral all the way down the toilet.Square-Enix was more focused on sales rather than making a good game and it shows.I dont understand why it took so long to release this game when there isn't that much to it. Besides the graphics which are pretty amazing there isn't much to enjoy.Dont eat this tripe thats sold to you as steak."
1,Mediocre at best,"Pros:- Graphics are kinda nice.Cons:- Very plain, stereotypical, forgettable characters.- Dialog attempts to be poetic, but winds up downright incomprehensible.- Extremely boring story. Interesting twists completely absent.- Awful AI for computer-controlled allies.Overall thoughts:If you are an intelligent male above the age of 12, you will probably not like this game. If you're into girly jap-pop and just want to see some neat colors and shapes on your TV, buy this game."
2,Square Enix killed Final Fantasy,"I have played every single FF game ever made and this game killed the essence of Final Fantasy. Buy this game ONLY if you are looking for a ""movie"" video game. There is ZERO...ZERO strategy here. All you do is follow a path, you can not deviate from this path, you can not explore since there are no other paths you can follow, there are no towns, there are no shops, you don't talk to other people to find clues, there are no side quests, there is nothing but a good story. The only reason I'm giving this game 2 starts is that the story is ok and the graphics are incredible. But get this, all you will do is go from A-B, That is it, nothing more. If you are like me you will buy this game anyway just because we have been waiting for a long time but you will be disappointed. The graphics are great but gameplay is SOOO boring that its impossible not to notice."
2,not a rpg,Definitely went backwards on this one not sure why. Seems like they tried something different but the old Final Fantasies are much better.
1,the most boring game ever,"since the moment I started playing it, I got bored the graphics are amazing and very nice picture of scenes but the movements and the speed of the game, makes it too boring, you just want to see next movie. summary the game is frustrating."
1,"It's like a scam, but it's legal.","FF13 is a great way to attract the non-hardcore gamers. Square knew all the hardcore gammers would buy FF13...which we did. The real goal was to attract casual gamers to make even more money. When you ask peolpe that Don't play the FF games, but have tried the game. Usually they will tell you the game is too complicated. I haven't seen a review claiming that yet. I guess it was a brilliant way to make some extra money. I just hope I can lear my lesson and not run out and buy FF14 on the release date."
1,The worst FF of the franchise,"This game is a big change from the previous ones. Sometimes change is a good thing but in this experience its not. They take away the towns, replace freedom with very linear ultra restrictive invisible wall environments, take away the leveling up system, give us 100 battle tutorials to understand, explain the storyline properly only through waves of text instead of the cutscenes/dialogue itself, give us the most uninteresting characters, doesn't let us control our parties, doesn't let us level up our weapons until much later and replace shops with simple menu screens from a save point.With all this how can any normal fan like this? Even if one was to enjoy the combat the game is way too linear especially when you feel like doing something else besides battles to take a break from it.Sorry Square Enix but you really dropped the ball on this one, first FF game ever where I'm compelled to sell it within a week of owning"
5,A Fun Game,"Personally, I thought this game was a lot of fun.Gorgeous graphics, a unique story line and a terrific battle system. I didn't feel frustrated by the battles - this is one game where I had a chance to progress. Just needed to think about strategy a bit. Paradigm system was very well thought out.The linearity didn't bother me in the least. You need to have some way to move the story forward. It opens up in the middle and after the story you have plenty of open spaces to explore & missions to complete. Not just a game, it felt like an interactive movie in a way.Characters were fun too - except one who was a bit too chipper. Still it was all in good fun.If you don't take your games too seriously but want to have a nice diversion - this is a good one. I got my money's worth."
3,"Boring, disappointing and lame","This game is not worth the full price... Like all of the other reviews said, any Final Fantasy fan will be very disappointed. That said, they did a great job with the graphics. Everything else is either a let-down or simply mediocre. All of the characters are annoying or melodramatic, which is fine, it is Japanese after all. Except for the fact that most JRPGs have some decent game play to make it worth while. Wait until it is on the greatest hits or completely avoid it."
4,Was alright.,"Not the best of the FF series, but wasn't too bad either. Hope they do a little better next time."
5,I really like the story,This is probably one of the best games I've played out of all the ffx games this is the best ever I'm pretty sure the other two disks are going to be epic!!!!!!
3,Decent Game but some flaws (my own opinion),"First off this is a good game but not the best or anything in my honest opinion. I'll keep it short in my views on this game, I've only am about 13 hours in the game.PROS:This has beautiful graphics and animation and cinematic. GORGEOUS environments.I really do enjoy the battle system and the leveling up.CONS:This is the biggest thing I can't get over. The story itself, but I can't get into it. I don't know is it because it's still in a sense early in a game or what but I can't just get into it. I get so bored listening to them talk about their life.Very linear gameplay so far. I don't get the whole upgrading swords??I know i'm not completely done with the game just yet, but honestly if i'm going to spend the amount of time to do a JRPG, I figure the story needs to grab me the first 1-2 or else i'll just get sick of it. So basically it's a solid game but I just can't get into it with the slow story."
5,It grew on me after 24 hours of gameplay....,"I was arguing about how linear the game was, but after playing it more and more... It grew on me. I enjoyed this game, but after I beat it... I never bothered leveling up anymore to finish other achievements\trophies... I'm waiting for the sequel to this."
3,Movie more than RPG,"I like to be involved in my RPG's. Maybe I was wrong to assume that FFXIII would be an RPG in the first place, but I thought that is what SE's Final Fantasy series' are known for.Basically, it seems all you do in this is fight. The fighting isn't particularly difficult mob-wise. In fact, the mob fighting is so incredibly easy it leaves you a bit unprepared for the bosses. The few bosses I fought weren't extremely hard, but I had to focus quite a bit more than I did for the mobs. It would be nice if the mobs prepared you for the boss.As for an RPG? Not really - more like a movie. You sit back while the characters pretty much do everything during the cut scenes. Very boring. The path is very linear as well. Not at all the mark of a good RPG."
3,"Oh, pretty pictures....zzzzzz.....","Mindbogglingly repetitive gameplay prevents anyone with a modicum of intelligence from wanting to continue playing this. It's basically like watching a horror film and believing you have control when you shout ""look behind you!"" and the main character actually turns.The art is gorgeous and the story is interesting, but I just couldn't force myself to keep playing. I figuratively frogmarched my boyfriend through the game while we took turns playing, and even with two people gunning for completion, we got sick of it.I tell myself I'll go back and play it again someday, and it wont be as painful as I remember...but I don't see that happening anytime in the near future. With the short time period between this and XIII-2, I figure that will have the same gameplay as this, so I just won't waste my money."
4,a title for your review,"I found a new copy of this game for $9.99 when it was usually selling for $19.99. I immediately bought it. Due to certain circumstances, I was told I had to wait about a month to receive the game. Luckily, they were able to ship it three weeks faster than they had planned. Gotta love Amazon. This isn't my favorite Final Fantasy (that award goes to IX or X), but it is a good game. Definitely worth $10, even $20."
5,fantastic album,"ever since i went to the album release party at the coconut teazer in hollywood this album has constantly been on my MP3 list. i see lots of comparisons to rem and the beatles. i get more of a beach boys vibe off of it, crossed with some toad the wet sprocket. the great thing about the album is it gets better with each listen. now where's the third ""double album"" they've been promising? they put on a great, though all too rare these days, live show too."
4,mmmmmmnnnnnnnnnnnn,Awesome CD! I was blown away. Just goes to show that the best music out there isn't signed. Richard Ace would be proud.
1,How to make the reader whore melancholic,"Disappointing. Apparently not Marquez' masterpiece. Not enough about [...], too much about music, aging, bicycle, and a lugubrious pimp. And apparently not enough melancholy either. Contrary to other readers, the subject matter does not disturb me, albeit difficult. In fact, the novella would be a hazardously illuminating literary feat if the narrator follows through with the protagonist's unflinching sexual appetite (in other words, failure to consummate) from the very beginning...rather twisting his pillars of yearning into some rambling barren sentimental crap."
1,empty,"Perhaps it's what I do for a living, I'm a psychotherapist. This book was a disappointment to me. The whining of a dsyfunctional geriatric male. To call what he experienced ""love"" is quite dsyfunctional. There is no ""love"" Do you call that a ""relationship?"" I am not sure what this book was- but it was rather misogynist."
1,Ninety-year Old Coot Finds True Love,"If this tick of a book had been written by anybody other than a Nobel Prize winner, it wouldn't have been published, nor liked. It's not believable nor is it unbelievable. It just stinks.Some old coot--cold, whore-crazed--wants a night with a virgin. I was hoping she'd wake up at some point and give him what he wanted--and it would kill him right away.So where's the romance with a pedophile?"
2,Why Mr. Marquez why?,"I do not want to be too harsh because I admire his talent. I wish I had never read this book. Great novelists, like Mr. Marquez, have the power of portraying eccentric, volatile yet real essence of life with pure, ordinary elements of everyday routine. One feels enriched upon reading such masterpieces. This book did the opposite. It gives a dull message using fantastic set of events and cartoonish characters. The message is forced and everything is patched together to poorly fulfill the minimal requirement of coherence. It is alienating to the reader. For example, Rosa Cabarcas character portrays more saint-like sister than a vicious veteran madam. There are pages one even senses a juvenile urgency to insert isolated pieces before the book ends.I do not know why Mr. Marquez thought this is a finished work ready to be read by the public."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"Granted, I have not read those which are considered Marquez's ""greatest"" works, but I was not too engaged with this story. Certainly, there are some beautifully written passages, and you can clearly picture the narrative, but I found I did not feel one way or the other about the main character. I didn't understand his mission/motives, and found I neither pitied nor condemned his actions. Even so, if you're looking for a quick read (and despite much self-provoking to slow down, it went very, very quickly), it's not a bad story to have under your belt--just don't expect something revolutionary."
2,A disappointment from a great author,"Although beautifully written, I found the protagonist just too unlikeable. He goes through a change but in my opinion never actually achieves transformation or real love, since he prefers his lover when she's asleep and therefore not a real person. I guess I should have guessed by the title that I wouldn't like this book."
2,Uninteresting Memories,"I was really dissapointed with this readable but mediocre piece of work from Garcia Marquez. Self-plagiarism is written all over it, the story just re-writes ideas already explored in his previous works. Seems he needed to publish something to fullfill a contract, not because he was inspired to write. Characters are dull and not believable, all relationships are shallow. At the end, the book left me with pity for the main character, a 90 year old pedophile who confused infatuation with love."
4,Love and it's miracles,"The book is a must-read. It gives you an inside look at the life of a man in his 90's. It reveals his thoughts, his young soul and his dreams. This book brings back, the meaning of love. Also, it shows that everything is possible in love; that even a man in his 90's can find love and be happy in his last years. It was wonderful and I enjoyed reading it."
4,Relaxed Read,"Loved the way this book was written. I enjoy books translated into English, not everyone's cup of tea - but I loved it."
4,Beautiful little book.,"The language romances you, woos you into the soul of a 90 year old man. He lives alone in an aging apartment in a city loved so much ""for the purity of its light"". He decides to celebrate his 90th birthday with a virgin whore. I was initially appalled by this concept yet Mr. Marquez is such a gifted and generous craftsman that I was soon falling in love with his unnamed character. It is a love story of the highest order. A story about the rejuvenating and eternal power of love. About never being too old to experience its joy.The size of this book was perfect. Novellas are a dying breed but ""Memories of My Melancholy Whores"" is a superb novella. A masterful little book that fits much into little.A definate must read."
4,"A cute little book, but almost like an echo of ""Love in the time.....""","I finished the book last month--fast reading enjoyable. However, my previous Marquez title was ""Love In The Time Of Cholera."" Somehow this book felt like a smaller version of the former. For example, the sin both books mature as ""protagonist"" through their old age, they both are pretty much glorified ""whore-mongers,"" they both have issues with love, both have a mother figure in their lives, both books are full of steamy sexual moments, in both cases the ""true-love"" remains delayed, asexual (it becomes or hints to become sexual only when that ""higher love"" is materialized or implied to materialize towards the end of both books), and of course, the girls are in both cases quite younger than the protagonist.I was actually going to give 3.5 stars, but Amazon does not have 1/2 star system. So, this time, Marquez amigo gets 4.Try it-not bad, not too great either."
3,An interesting plot gone wrong,"""Memories of My Melancholy Whores"" started out great but ended up a bit of a dud. The premise of the book is interesting enough: a 90-year-old man decides to treat himself to a young virgin on his birthday. He ends up falling in love with her, and spends the next year obsessing over her and reflecting back on all the prostitutes he's slept with over the years. The book also touches on what it's like to age and fear one's imminent death. Unfortunately, though, many of the narrator's recollections are incredibly bland, making this short novel difficult to plow through. I suppose the author was trying to show us how uneventful the narrator's previous relationships have been, but that technique lost my interest in the process."
2,Not to par with his great works,"This book is not up to the level of any other major work by Marquez. Characters are mechanical, the main protagonist appears to be one dimensional and boring, and there is no excitement in this book. More importantly it is difficult to feel any empathy towards any of the characters."
2,Recycled and shallow... is this really Marquez ?,"The protagonist of this book mentions a Latin quote: ""No old man forgets where he has hidden his treasure"" Well....in this case it seems that Marquez has forgotten exactly that: the place where he has hidden his superb skills as a narrator of fascinating, magic realistic stories.The novel is a shallow, disappointing story about a 90 years old bachelor and his love for a teenage virgin he likes to watch while she sleeps. The magic atmosphere of the small South American city which is Marquez forte in other novels feels like a strained recycled background to an unsatisfying story.Is it possible that like Salvador Dali at old age allowing young painters to imitate his style, this book was written by a ghost writer while the old master nods his head slowly in the heat of an afternoon siesta in Macombo ?"
3,OK FOR ON TASK,ITS OK BUT RUNS SLOW. TO WORK ON ONE BASIC TASK AT A TIME YOU NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST 1 GIG OF RAM ON YOUR COMPUTER.
1,not compatible,This will not work with the latest version of OSX - won't even load. Had to return it. Amazon was great and refunded my money promptly
2,Well what CAN I say?!,"This software is in fact VERY SLOW! Even though it's helpful in using windows applications, I'm still dissapointed in how slow it runs. Only buy if you absolutely must, otherwise it's a useless investment."
4,Not quite there yet...,"Works well overall, but still pretty slow and I'm using it with a G5 where it's supposed to be speed optimized."
1,Waste of money,"This software arrives with little content....the implication in the descripton (at least to me) was that it included most, if not all, of Microsoft's XP. Not true at all....typical Microsoft ripoff. Plus won't accept uploads from Mac disk drive. All in all, a total waste of time and money."
2,A Big Disappointment,"When I upgraded from Mac OS 9.2 to OS 10 with the purchase of my new laptop I was very excited to go from Virtual PC 4.2 to the new 7.0 Home edition. I'd rather have my 4.2 back. Aside from the fact that it is incredibly slow, I have had to remove & reinstall it 4 times due to gliches of an unknown origin that I couldn't fix. Microsoft is no help what so ever unless I want to pay their exorbitant fees for support. There is no free support even for newly received products. If there was another product on the market that could replace this I would buy it instead. At this point I feel like I would rather have purchased a PC than to have to deal with this frustration."
1,Worthless Software,"Don't waste your money. It does not work with the new Imac's withIntel Dual Processors, and once you open the package you are stock with it.Wait for the new operating system ""Leopard"". That has ""Boot Camp"" as partof the operating system"
3,Slow but works,"Response is very, very slow, especially with Internet Explorer, but it eventually does what it is supposed to do. I do have a PC CD-ROM that it does not work with but other than that it serves its purpose."
1,The only thing that has crashed Mac OSX,"This is the worst piece of software I have ever used. Three separate installations have brought my Mac (with 10.43) to a complete halt. Each time the Virtual PC Windows installation was too scrogged to work after a hard re-boot. The last time it also managed to scrogg my OS-X Mail configuration (and who knows what else). I should have known better than to install Microsoft software on a functioning computer. For not much more money you can by an old, used Windows PC - that way when it crashes, at least it won't mess up your Mac."
3,It charged for duty fee.,"The cinnamon is arrived as described and everything is good. However, I was charged for $8 for duty fee or handle fee by post office. I do not know why I was charged. Next time I still are happy to order something from this company, but I suggest this company does not include shipping fee into the total price which customer spend when they fill out the form at post office."
3,For reference only,"The book, study guide, and solution manual will give you a good overview of GD&T;, but doesn't deliver on the title.Not much on the design side, except for fundamentals of position tolerances and fasteners.You get what you pay for."
4,"Fits a Honda Civic, of course","I bought it to replace a broken door handle, installed it, and all was well for a few months until the plastic housing for the lock mechanism broke, and it fell back into the door. Maybe it was just a bad mold, or some bad plastic. I'm going to buy another and try again, but if it breaks again I'd have to give it one star."
4,Great and funny toy,I don't know why poor Scrat got so many bad reviews. My kids absolutely LOVE this toy. They laugh hysterically every time and they're 4 1/2 and 7. He does have a tendency to fall down and doesn't scoot very well. But the laugh factor alone makes this well worth the money.
2,Disappointed,"After reading all reviews on Amazon, I have purchase this toy for kids and was very disappointed: tail does not move, does not do more than few jumps and even I have installed brand new batteries, you still have to push his nose every 10-15 seconds , so it would do something. Money defiantly spend for a wrong toy . Will not recommend to anyone."
5,Ice Age 2 Go Nutz Scrat,I collect Scrat things. I am 51 and enjoy the movies and of course Scrat. I have it sitting on my side bedroom table & lightly cross the arms of my eye glasses & place them on him. He is my eye glass holder. I look forward to more Scrat products.I sculpt & am thinking of making a tea pot of him with acorn cups to match.
1,Goin Nutz Scrat Toy is Goin Back toy,"Goin Nutz Scrat Toy is not really that great. I think it's a bit ""over-developed"" trying to be something of a toy that it's not. A stuffed animal with Scrat ""noises"" would've been perfect. A velcro attached acorn would've been fine. I cringe thinking that somebody got paid to develop such a ludacris toy. Toys should be simple, not needing explaination to what it's doing or happening. Enough said, end of review, THUMBS DOWN on this gimmick of a toy. Can you say ""return""?"
4,A book for devoid of water,This is book useful for all practising civil engineers.As the tremondous requirement of space construction activities are taking place in the areas of river shore also.so it is mandatory for going a dewater system without any difficulties.This book guides us in right path in right time
1,so slow as to be unusable,After 3 weeks with helpful Minolta tech support staff I have discovered that it is normal and OK for this printer to take 12 minutes to print one 8' x 8' regular photograph at 300 dpi at the printer's lowest resolution. That is way too long to be practical in a business environment. I regret the purchase.
5,Still ticking.,I installed this in my watch a while ago and it is still working. It is exactly what I was looking for - and an awesome price too.
4,Florence Ballard and the Supremes,"Great release, the songs have never sounded better. But, as a die-hard Supremes fan, it's clear these 2 tracks, although classics, aren't quite as good as some of their others. My World Is Empty Without You will always sound a little empty since it lacks Florence Ballard's superior soaring vocals, and the Flo-less and Mary-less Love Child never reaches it's full potential. These two much loved singers can simply never be replaced. Still great and glad they were made availble."
2,Only Amazon.com Purchase I ever returned,"I bought this book with the best of intentions, however the lessons were stilted and labored. I continued reading on hoping to find something valuable I could take away from the book, but in the end I came away with nothing. In being fair to the author, I suppose if you are a complete beginner, this book may hold some value, however if you have spent any amount of time writing in any form, there is little here that will aid you in your quest to write flash fiction.This was the only Amazon.com purchase I have returned in all the years and hundreds of books I have purchased. If you have read any books on writing in the past, please don't waste your money. I ended up losing in the end because I paid for shipping and was hit with some other fee, so I actually paid over $5 to read the book. Oh well."
1,"Very Poor Value, high cost , Poor fit, decpetive photo","I purchased these for my c70 volvo and was disappointed to see the poor value and fit they represent. For 70.00 I expect a very good fit and for 70.00 I expect the photos to be accurate. Theses are front mats only NOT LIKE IN THE PICTURE where front and rear are shown. Give me a break, for 70.00 only two rubber mats! stay away from these and buy the 4 mat set at Target or PepBoys"
3,Weathertech floor mats,"I really like the quality construction of the mats. They have the ability to protect my new carpet from all matter of refuse. My only complaint is that for the price they should have been shaped to the floors shapes. My S2000 has a ridge across the back of the foot well and these mats sit on top not conform to the shape. It causes the back of the mat to stick up in the air. This isn't a huge problem, but doesn't look as good and could cause liquids to flow off the front of the mat"
1,make-sure-it-fits feature is WRONG,"Was asked year,make,model and trim package to ensure proper fit. They said it would, but it never will! As a matter of fact, I said I have a nissan frontier, but the invoice says I have a volvo. I suspect it wouldnt fit that either. Now I have to spend even more money to send them back! Dont fall for their ruse!"
2,Classic Rubbers Mats,"Not happy with the mats that I bought, even thow it was ask what type of car I had the mats don't fit like I thought they would. After spending $69.00 I excepted a better fit."
2,Poor fit for Nissan Frontier,"The WeatherTech W3 Rubber Mats are a poor fit for 2011 Nissan Frontier. The cut-out for the driver's side foot rest is short by 4"" inches, nor does it accommodate for the center console bump-out. The same goes for the passenger side mat. It does not accommodate the center console bump-out and has a mysterious 8"" x 2"" cut-out along the upper right corner of the mat. We have nice fitting WeatherTech rubber mats for our Toyota Sienna, but didn't have much luck with the W3 for my Frontier work truck."
1,DOES NOT FIT AT ALL,"I have a 2010 Toyota FJ Cruiser. I entered my vehicle to make sure I was ordering the correct model of floor mat and even verified it on WeatherTech's website. I received the correct floor mat model # I ordered (W3) and it does not fit at all! The FJ's floor has particularly-shaped indention for a mat to go and the WeatherTech mat was even close to that shape, I mean not even a similar shape at all! It even overlaps over the left footrest. WeatherTech should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass this on as a product that will work for my car. If they didn't want to create a mat just for my car then don't tell me it will work for my car! Just say, ""sorry we do not have an available mat for your particular car."" Now I have to return these."
2,"Good mats, poor fit","I bought a set of these directly from the manufacturer, figuring that at least I would get a semi-custom fit as per their description. Such is not the case. They are well built, a very substantial mat. However, the fit is not quite there. I called to make sure I received the correct ones, and was advised that it's a 'generic fit' and I had indeed received the correct mats for my car.As it is, I'll make do. Weathertech offers a 30 day money back guarantee, but it's net of shipping charges. Since it cost me $15 to get them shipped and probably a similar amount to return them, I'll just keep them and look on it as tuition for a lesson learned.Next time I'm in the market for mats I'll buy locally."
5,Biometeorology textbook,"This is the 2nd volume on biometeorology written by Professor Lowry and his son--Porter P, Lowry II. Lowry senior did not live to finish this volume, which probably was the reason for the delay in it being published. His sons promised to finish this volume for him. It took them approximately 2 years to do this.Just as the title implies, it is about the interactions of organisms and the atmosphere.Categories include:Plants and the Atmosphere: PhysiologyPlants and the Atmosphere: Growth and DevelopmentManagement of Plant MicroenvironmentsAnimals and the Atmosphere: Some Basic PrinciplesAnimals and the Atmosphere: Small Animals including InsectsAnimals and the Atmosphere: Large Animals including ManMan's Personal Climate: Comfort, Clothing and HousingMan's Regional Climate: Urban and Industrial EffectsA Look Backward and a Look ForwardThis volume along with the first is for anyone interested in the functioning of life on Earth."
5,Pleased with purchase,"The spice rack is what I hoped. My largest spice containers don't fit, but most do, so my spices are much easier to find and take up less space in my cabinet."
4,Really pleased,We like the way the spice organizer fits into our cupboard and with the amount of spices that we can put into the organizer we have room for other items. The trays pull out easily and allow access to all of the spices. Would strongly recommend this organizer
4,Spice stack: the perfect space saver,"We love this little invention. Saves lots of space and makes all the spices accessible while cooking.Only complaint is that the construction is in need a more detail. As pictured when the bottom shelf is open it places a fair amount of stress on the unit, so we had to reinforce it to ensure a long life.A little pricey but nothing else like it out there."
5,Great Organizer!,"I'd been looking for a spice organizer for a long time, and this one goes above and beyond my expectations. So happy with my purchase!"
5,I am sorry I waited so long!,"I wish I had ordered this years ago! I read other reviews about concerns that this spice rack was flimsy, but really...it states what it is made of. Knowing this, I ordered it anyway and was very happy to see that it was so sturdy. The material it was made of was thicker than what I had imagined. I am very please with this product."
5,Love this spice rack,"This spice rack is great. It holds 27 jars, I think (15 ""standard"" sized, 12 ""large"" sized). Although the plastic it's made from feels kind of flimsy, it holds together remarkably well and the weight of the spices will keep the rack from slipping (along with the rubber/silicone feet). Each drawer pulls out nicely without catching and seems to defy gravity as you pull them out and let them pivot downwards so you can see all the spices. The drawers will come out if you pull them too hard or unevenly, but it does take a pretty hefty yank. It's only happened to us 2 or 3 times in the 18 months we've owned it. This rack also saved us a TON of cabinet space. Highly recommended."
5,Fantastic spice organizer,My daughter saw this in Ready Made magazine. It is just what I needed. The spices on the old turntable I had were always falling off. I couldn't see what was in the middle. This organizer makes it super easy to quickly find what I need. It fits great in the cupboard. I am very happy with this purchase and got the best price through Amazon.
3,SPICE HOLDER,VERY GOOD IDEA BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER IF PLASTIC HAD BEEN OF A HIGHER QUALITY AND HEAVIER GRADE. WOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE OPTION.
4,Spice Organization Problems Solved!,"I use a lot of herbs and spices and now they are all neatly organized and accessible in two Spice Stacks SPICE STACK. They fit side by side in the same cabinet that used to hold all my spice jars on little shelves, with enough extra room for the few large containers that wouldn't fit in the Spice Stacks. No more jars and tins falling off shelves every time I open the cupboard."
4,Spice Stack,I waited a long time to order this spice rack. I was hoping it would be sold in the local stores so that I could actually see it. It has been a life saver in organizing my spices.
5,Better suited for counter top,"I just purchased a second one of these. Great idea. Best thing around for spices in a small area...BUT....There is no way the plastic tabs at the end of the drawer will support the weight of a full drawer.The drawer when fully extended will have to rest on something solid to take the stress off of the plastic tabs.I would like to have placed this item in the cupboard but have decided to place both of these on the counter top. I then placed on top of the spice cabinets, other items like pepper mill, salt and pepper shakers, egg timer, thermometers, etc."
1,Disappointing and Dangerous,"Disappointing. It fit excellently in my cabinet, would have held all the spices I have, but the shelves do not stay. I started by loading the bottom shelf just fine, and moved up to the second. After it was half full the shelf itself fell out. I left it alone thinking it could be operator error, and came back after half an hour to try again. I loaded a few in the top shelf, when it fell out as well. I went back to the second shelf, and it fell out when almost fully loaded again.I do not understand why the bottom shelf was fine, but the other two were not secure. It is possible there was a defect in what I received, but if so it was not obvious and I inspected the shelves pretty thoroughly when they kept falling out. It's an excellent idea, but clearly need to be made out of something more sturdy."
4,Very good product,"The spice stack is a great space saver. I was concerned it would look cheap and be flimsy, but I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't hold unusually large or odd shaped containers, but I only had 3 or 4 of those. I didn't even realize I had 2 or 3 jars of some of the same spices until I went through and put them in. Funny! This won't happen now that they are organized and easy to see. I have a small lazy susan next to it that holds my salt and pepper mills and the very few items that didn't fit in it well. I have extra space in my cupboard now and I'm very pleased with my purchase. Worth every penny."
5,Works great for me!,"I've never been big on cooking, which applies to most bachelors, I suppose, but I realized that one big reason I never cooked was because I didn't have many spices. Over time, I've acquired more and more in order to make more exotic and tasty foods, and I soon realized I needed a way to organize them. This works really well! It's not going to win any awards for aesthetics, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do and tucks away neatly into the cabinet."
3,spice stack,"I love that this product takes care of my spice clutter. I also am pleased that they included labels. It's a little flimsy once you fill it with spice bottles, so it's important to take care when pulling open the shelves."
1,Piece of Junk!,"we ordered 2 racks and they are complete junk! one had discoleration and greasy fingerprints on it, the other was assembled upside down. and i'm sorry but 30 dollars for some poorly assembled flimsy plastic is ridiculous!"
4,Works as advertised,Works as advertised. Quality is a little flimsy but fills the need. Would recommend and order again any time. .
5,Great organizer and space saver,This spice rack holds so much I am not able to fill it yet. I like how the drawers pull out and fold down so you can grab as you work. It fits perfectly in my cupboard and made more space for other items. Great rack for a great price.
5,"Great way to get organized, save time & money","The spice rack fits perfectly into my cabinet. Now, I can go right to the spice I am looking for without digging around. I can see everything I have, so there are now no duplications...saves money. Great product."
5,wonderful item!!,Received this as a gift and it is exactly what I needed to organize my spices in my cupboard. Actually thinking of ordering another one!!Cheryl in Nebraska
4,Nice way to organize your spice cupboard,"This was a wonderful solution to my cluttered spice cupboard. I had been using a lazy susan, but it was over loaded and some of the spices would fall off behind it making it hard to turn. I also ended up crowding some spices in front. It was a headache to dig out rarely used spices from the back.With this product I eliminated all of my cluttered spices AND have only used about 50% of the capacity of this item. It is sturdy and easy to use.It holds the small, medium and large spice containers well, but I have one extra large spice container (the largest seasoning salt container) that doesn't fit in this rack. For 95% of the spice bottles out there you'll be fine."
1,terrible. choose something else!,"I've ordered three. two were broken, as were two replacements they sent. Fragile plastic breaks and can't support the weight of the drawers and spices. They were really nice about sending replacements and refunds, though."
2,kathys review,i like the rack but it doesnt hold all sizes which was disappointing and it really needs to be attached to the cuboard it will tip out which is dangerous for a young kid.
5,exactly what i needed for my small cabinet,I have one cabinet that is narrower than average. I'd bought 2 different spice organizers and they didn't fit. This fit just right. The drawers are easy to pull out.
5,exactly as advertised,I love this spice rack! It does exactly what it's supposed to do. It fits perfectly in my cabinet. The drawers slide out easily. The spaces accommodate all my spice bottles of various sizes. It does exactly what I need: stores my spices in an easy to see and organized way!
5,out of this world,This is a must have for any kitchen. It is a real time saver. I don't have to spend 5 or 10 mintues looking for the spice I need. I highly recommend this to everyone. It is a well made item. GET ONE. Would make a great gift for any kitchen.
4,great design,"Like others, I really like the design of this but am dubious as to how well it will hold up over time. It probably would have been better made of metal than plastic. When a loaded drawer is pulled out there's a lot of stress on little plastic pins...especially if you have glass spice jars. It seems to be the only thing anything like it on the market though and the idea is brilliant."
5,This item has proven to be the most helpful spice rack.,"I have purchased or examined many styles of spice racks over the years, but this one fits the particular cupboard and holds all the spices that I purchase in normal sizes. It is easy to organize the spices in the three levels, and they are at a good eye-level for a short to tall person. (I am 5'1"". My husband is 6'4"".The only thing you need to check carefully is to see if the cabinet is wide enough for the doors to open. Some cabinets have wide boards in the middle that prevents opening the drawers.A good investment. I am thinking of purchasing some for Christmas gifts.Thanks"
5,Spice rack,"This cleared out a lot of space in my cabinets and keeps everything cool and dry. Now I don't have to search thru all the shelves to find the spice I want. I'm thinking of other uses for this product, namely a thread holder for my sewing area. Very glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone."
4,just as pictured,"fits a lot of spices! The only downside is that if you put a rather large bottle in one of the shelves, its hard to get that shelf open. But, this saved lots of room in my cabinet and its worth the price."
4,Makes use of high shelves,"What I love about this rack is that I can put it on a higher shelf, one that is too high for me to see for storing spices individually or on a lazy Susan. The levels of this slide down and pull out, bringing them down to a viewable level when I access them, but then slide back up to that otherwise unused shelf. This is one of the best space-saving devices I've ever had, and it stores both ""regular"" sized spice jars and those that are slightly taller and wider. Fits most brands. There is one brand I have that doesn't fit in the rack, though. If you want to store all of your spices in it, you might be disappointed unless you have only standard sizes."
5,I Can Reach It!,"I love this little cabinet! I can see by the labels where everything is, can easily pull the shelf out and get my choice. No more shuffling items around and knocking stuff off the shelf. This is wonderful, especially for short people who have a limited view!"
5,LOVE MY SPICE RACKS!,"I am a major chef in my home. I cook from scratch and really love that I am able to see the labels of my spices and just pull out the rack drawer without having to hunt for spices that inevitably fall out all over me. This rack holds almost all of my spices and I even stacked a second one on top to add even more spices. I am able to have organization and easy find with this neat product. LOVE IT!Thanks,Amy MillerNorth Carolina"
4,"Wife loved it, perfect Xmas gift","Two Tagco Spice Stacks fit perfectly, stacked. All spices fit except for the very largest size. Makes finding that elusive spice simple."
5,Great spice organizer.,"Great organizer for your spices. Not flimsy at all, seems very solid. Holds most size containers. A few of our spices are too tall so we will just purchase new containers for them. Well worth the money for organizing your spices."
5,Excellent multicultural Text!!,If you are looking for art Ideas from around the globe this is an excellent book. It also has mini test to give students. I tried several of this activities and students had a great time.The projects turned out fabulous.
4,"Welcome home, Bruce","Ever since,perhaps, Born in America, I have regarded Bruce's music as more relevent and ""concerned"" than rocking, constantly in transiton looking to discover the prefect place to be. And I bought and listened because, like Dylan and LennonMcCartney, I regarded his art as original and authentic. The music was sensitive, angry, depressing and anything but fun.This album is just pure unapologetic fun! It's like Dylan remembering his roots and trading the Strat for a D-16.Who else could have turned an album of campfire songs into joyous party music?I only wish more of Mr. Seeger's classics would have been covered . An updated version of ""Bring them Home"" would have been incredible!"
1,damn copy protection!!!!!!!!!,"If you have an older cd player, or want to play this CD in your computer, don't buy this CD!"
5,The Seeger Sessions,I loved this CD. The arrangements were great! Bruce on the vocals was a perfect fit. I found myself thinking about a few songs during the day and singing it out loud. Watching the video really makes you appreciate the different muscians and how they work together to produce something meaningful and beautiful. Bye.. I think I'll go watch it again!
4,Front porch folk,Pour yerself a whisky and turn the volume up. This is a great album of folk classics that sounds like its being belted out on the front porch of an old farmhouse. I love it.
4,Interesting new take on a very old theme,"I purchased this recording on the advice of a review in the American Heritage Magazine. It is interesting hearing Bruce's take on these songs, many of which I learned in grade through high school. Here, he brings an energy, intensity and instrumentation that I had never considered. I found the videos on the flip (DVD) side of the CD especially interesting. Here, you get to see the Bruce the rocker driving down songs like John Henry with a truly amazing and eclectic collection of musicians all crowded into Springsteen's living room. Being part of it must have been a rip."
4,Just plain fun!,"The music on this CD is classic (I remember learning some of these songs in elementary school), and just a blast to listen to and sing along. Springsteen's raspy voice and musical talent works well with the selection of songs."
2,"""The Boss"" does Pete Seeger = strangely disappointed.","Not sure, maybe just the pre-listen hype, e.g. that this album destined to become instant classic; in any event, I listened, then listened again. Although a huge fan, of both artists, I do not like Mr. Springsteen's renditions, somehow lacking the ""soul""that made Mr. Seeger a true legend."
2,"The Boss does A Mighty Wind, Part Two","I've got to land on the side of the people disappointed that Bruce is not doing his own music. It's not that I wanted to hear another GHOST OF TOM JOAD or DEVILS & DUST either because I think he's done the folk thing to death, but some rock and roll would be refreshing...since it doesn't seem to exist anymore.With every track I hear, I can't stop picturing a recording studio with The Boss performing with The Folksmen, The New Main Street Singers and Mitch & Micki.(I also still cannot get the image of Bruce selling out to the Kerry campaign in 2004)."
4,listen to the original,"nothing against Bruce Springsteen, and I haven't heard the album, but when I look at Pete Seeger on Amazon.com, the highest number of reviews written for any one of his records is 6 , and thats for the Greatest Hits....!!!! (Pete's missus probably wrote three of them)this album is on release two days and here we are with 36 reviews!! by the end of the week there be a 100 reviews!!!....everybody listening to Bruce Springsteen singing Pete Seeger songs.....does it not make sense to also go back to the source?......what I did hear of this album on the radio sounded very good. i am not here to diss it, but I'm sure old Pete himself is worth a listen just as much as this album...."
2,"New Orleans style, but not Bruce's style","A completely new sound for Bruce. It might be something you would listen to if you were in the mood for zydako music, a sort of New Orleans Jazzy sound. At times Bruce slurs his words like Dylan, and other times he sounds like he ought to be singing ""gitty up horsey"". This is a very strange combination of songs, and after listening to it, I would unlikely buy it for my Bruce collection."
2,Clones to the left of me ...,"""We"" shall overcome, Bruce?We?With all due respect, what exactly is it you're trying to overcome, Boss?A tough tax bracket?Difficult decisions on which of your dozens of cars to drive each day?Your musical limitations and inability to grasp the core of these songs as you howl your way through them?The album, as anyone with their own ears can attest, is pretty much a raucous mess, a soundscape for scarecrows, a screaming plea for relevance. Walk on by."
1,Time to go away Bruce,"Bruce is done, he needs to pack it in. He was always grossly overrated and he get's worse with each album."
3,A little irony in the filthy rich singing American folk,"If you can get past some of the baggage Springsteen carries, this is a pretty decent album. Springsteen's ""I'm just a poor working class multi-millionaire, see, I'm even wearing blue jeans"" image has always been a little ridiculous. Springsteen also sings every song (even the cheery ones) in an angry and grizzled old-man voice. However, the music on this album is timeless, and the instrumentation is great. The album is also a lot of fun for road trips."
1,Locks up my iMac in the worst way and can't be ejected !!,"DON""T BUY IT !!!! I am a big fan of Springsteen and his music and I was expecting to love this CD. But I should have read the reviews more carefully. This non-standard CD not only won't play through my G5 iMac but it locked up my computer and could not be ejected EVEN AFTER REBOOTING THE SYSTEM !! I thought I was going to have to get a screwdriver to get it out. This disk will definitely be returned. I hope that Bruce wises up and dumps Sony or whomever chose to release this as a DuoDisk. It's worse than junk - it's DANGEROUS...DON""T BUY IT !!!!"
1,WHAT HAPPENED??,"My husband and I were more than disappointed. Bruce, the Boss, the Man ....well, it was a let down to hear him holler and screech with much too loud accompanyment - it hurt our ears and our brains.... we have NEVER been unahappy with any of his releases until now.... if he just did this for fun, that's great, but perhaps he should have kept it at home. We are more than surprised at the great reviews this has received. Just don't get it at all... unless you want to listen to a kid's play time music, but then we have heard a lot better of that sort as well - the world already has one ""Barney"". Hope he gets back to MUSIC in the near future. BRUCE, PLEASE COME BACK!!"
5,Outstanding Tribute to Pete Seeger,"When I heard about this disc, I was a little hesitant to get it at first. I've been a fan of Bruce Springsteen for more than 25 years, and a fan of Pete Seeger for a little longer. When I heard Bruce was making a disc of Pete's music, I thought it would be good, but since I already have those songs it might not be worth buying this disc.I'm happy to say I was wrong about that. Bruce has a great band backing him up on these songs, and the result is very different sound. I would love to know what Pete thinks of these new versions of his classic songs, and my guess is that he'd love them.The disc includes a dvd, but I haven't watched it yet. I'd like to see it, but haven't been able to pry the disc out of my cd player since I got it last week. This is the best disc from Bruce in a long time."
1,Album is a wonderful idea but DualDisc is a terrible one!,"I was so excited about this melding of two of my favorite artists that I preordered it and popped the CD into my computer moments after opening the amazon package. What little music I could hear sounded great, but due to the new format my computer won't recognize more than a few seconds of music from the entire CD.New technology is great in theory, but come on -- who releases a music CD with a label on it that states it ""will not play on some CD players""?!?!"
1,IPOD Users beware!!!,"This is produced in a format, Dual Disc, that I was not aware of. The CD side will not play on some CD players including the player on my new Dell. Therefore, I can't load it onto my IPOD.I will never buy another dual disc format. We don't even have CD players in our primary living spaces anymore. We use IPOD docking stations.Since I have had my IPOD I have bought more CDs than I ever did. But I listen to my music in new ways now. I feel ripped off by the Boss. He won't be getting any more of my money."
3,Very nice CD,"If you like old timey/traditional music, I would certainly pick this up - Bruce having a good time with a great backing band (You really can't help the toe tapping that will overcome you).If you are looking for some type of meaningful new material - this isn't it. Just a hall of fame artist with a great backing band doing Pete Seeger/traditional/folk music and having some fun. A very nice purchase but certainly not essential Bruce.As for the SONY bit, I was able to read the disc (PC). I was unable to play the CD portion on my stereo (new player). I was infected by the rootkit SONY distributed illegally earlier this year but I think I finally have all vestiges of it gone (SONY should pay me for the trouble). For those of you having issues, perhaps the rootkit is not totally done. I was having trouble ripping CDs (still) until i ran the latest version of their software. Overall, 4 stars for Bruce. 0 stars for his record company and the format."
1,Bruce Plays it safe,"With no less than the title ""We shall overcome"", you would thing that Bruce Springstein would use his iconic status and recognized talent to say something of his own, which goes beyond 'entertainment' - not so! Yes, you tapp your foot to some pleasant rhythms, but why the misleading allusion to Pete seeger and social change? Both the songs' selection and the musical interpretation tell us nothing about Bruce's musical and/or world view about the area which he is supposed to explore here. While the album is a misnomer at best, the song ""we shall overcome"" is the worst. It is painful to listen to the hopeless groans. It left me depressed."
2,He Shall Over-Sing,"Can't fault the canon - it's almost cliché to say that Seeger was/is one for the ages, as is Springsteen himself, and it was a joy to discover unheard gems. But Seeger purists will protest and Bruce's fans will exult [they rejoice everything their Boss doles]. Alas, Folk music is Folk music, folks, and Springsteen's intrinsic tendency for the Folk-less bellowing abandons every nuance by thumping every message home and only deters from the neglected could-have-been beauty. When you're a gazillionaire liberal not content with swimming in your ocean of cash, who else do you need to please other than yourself? I'm not sure whom he's singing to or for here. Other than Dave Marsh, Public Springsteen Sycophant Numero Uno, of course. My grade: B"
2,What a waste,"Bruce has one of the best band in R'& R' history at his disposal but seems to be very reluctant to use it in a studio setting or outside a R'&R;' format; I wonder why.The group on the album is an average folk band, but nothing to write home about. Let's hope the tour will be a lot better then this album.You can make a better use of your hard earned money by buying the wonderful Hammesmith Odeon concert from 1975 - which is the best official live album from Bruce by a long shot. Let's hope they dig out some other gems like that from 1978-79."
1,We shall over come : The Seeger Sessions,"Purchsed tha Album as my husband had purchased tickets for the MEN concert 7th May 2006.My reaction on listening to it was one of disbelief, from New Jersey rock to Dixie? No way. I attended last nights concert with trepidation but still hopefull that Bruce would come through and give his long term fans what they wanted to hear. This was not to be and despite the reviews in the papers today, at least half of the crowd were booing. This was borne out by the inactivity and relative silence of the crowd which is not what anyone would expect at a concert by The Boss. Even the rare 'old' song such as Cadillac Ranch was performed in the genre of folk! In despair my husband and I left early, unable to tolerate any more.Bruce you are no longer The Boss but someone who has lost their way and many fans. You may be in a position to criticise your President but what about looking inwards and considering the fans who have put you where you today."
2,A pet project?,"I love Bruce Springteen because of his great songs. So I'm not so wild about this. Sorry Bruce, Your one of my faves."
1,sadly disappointed,"obviously the boss's tank is empty (maybe those high gas prices have hit even him). These overblown takes on ancient folk songs are not worth listening to. If you really want to relive camp kukamonga, get the old golden book records and drink the kool-aid. E-street where are you?"
5,"Electric, Acoustic, Folk - who cares - it's BOSS TIME!",This album is unbelievable. Springsteen never ceases to amaze me ... this folk-gospel ridden blues album is electrifying. It presents songs of liberation and hope to a country and people that need relief from foreign oil and war.
3,"favorite songs, not favorite singer","I love any story-telling music, I think folk music is one of the best ways to commit memory to heart, and the songs of Pete Seeger have always been special to me. Even though folk music is meant to be sung by anyone at any time, I found this collection to be more about Bruce Springsteen singing than the stories. I applaud him for offering it, but I couldn't get over his particular stylings. If Alvin and the Chipmunks sang Bob Dylan's greatest hits, I'd probably buy it for the Dylan and hate it for the chipmunks. That's kind of how I feel about this cd. I sent it to my mom, who loves folk music too and she felt about the same.So, I recommend the music, and if you like Bruce Springsteen's voice and music, this will be one of your favorites!"
5,The Boss,Once again Springsteen proves he is a versatile musician. I really enjoyed the laid back style of the recording.
4,Bruce Springsteen does Pete Seeger???,"I consider Pete Seeger as one of the greatest folk singers around. Buying The Seeger Sessions sung by ""The Boss"" Bruce Springsteen and friends was a bit of a gamble, but I have to admit, that the interpretation of Seegers work by Bruce and his gang was good, very good. I keep my 5 stars for the best, but 4 stars tells, that I really liked this cd!Gerard C. van ParrerenOostzaan, The Netherlands"
3,Difficult to enjoy the music,The music is outstanding but I have a difficult time listening to the CD as it will only play in my car. We have a fairly new CD system in our home but it just skips over the entire CD - I've tried both sides. My husband can't listen to it all in his car. I was forwarned about this problem and figured that it would not affect us. I will keep this in mind when there is another Bruce Springsteen CD I am interested in and won't buy it.
2,Cannot play the CD side at all,"This gets 2 stars because the DVD side is worth 5, but I can't play the CD side on my computer AT ALL. I'm using an iMac G5, and iTunes doesn't seem to be able to be able to read the CD, though iDVD has no problem with the DVD side. The disc doesn't seem to be actually defective--I can play it on my car CD player--so I have to conclude that it's a format problem. It's still unacceptable, because I don't want to have to be in my car to listen to the disc. In fact I listen to music mostly on my computer and on my iPod, and if I can't get iTunes to read it, I can't get it on my iPod either. I have no idea what to do about this--having bought the CD, I don't want to have to buy it again through iTunes. Needless to say, I'm steamed, and it'll be a long time before I'll consider buying another dual-format disc."
1,Another DualDisc rant...!,"Great album... Really *LOUSY* format!The 1-star is for DualDisc, NOT a truly enjoyable album by Bruce. A similar rant will be posted for the DualDisc version of ""DEVILS & DUST"".Not only can I not use these discs in my PC, and I have gotten to the point where I do a LOT of my listening while on the PC, but I have found that the discs also will not play in certain stand-alone players. Wanna import into your iPod??? FORGET it!!!The ONE good thing I'll say about the DualDisc format is that it's not being foisted on the general public anymore!!Not to defend Sony, but they do warn right on the package that the DualDisc format MAY not work in all players. Now if they would just reissue this album, as well as ""DEVILS & DUST"" on a standard CD format I would be happy. Make that *happier*! As it is, I can't get either album into my iPod and, rather than pay iTunes for a digital download, I would rather pay for a *real* CD version of each album for my collection."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,Even as a lifelong Springsteen fan I was extremely (and pleasantly) surprised at the music on this CD. You could sense through the music (and the DVD) how much fun Bruce had putting this arrangement together. What's even better is that my two kids (ages 5 and 7) absolutely love the CD as well so we can all enjoy everywhere we go!!
4,Funky Folky Fun,"When I first fed this album into my car CD changer I was a bit disappointed. The sound was not quite what I had in my. However, by the end of the 3rd track I was hooked. The songs, mostly familiar, have nice catchy words. The music is bluegrass, which I must say I tend to enjoy. The sound quality is very unique. With different parts being sung by separate groups it's almost a ""live around a campfire"" notion without all the background garbage. All in all I was very pleased and anytime I'm stressed and need to sing my lungs out this is the CD I go to."
1,Overcome what??? Lies of 9/11 or Iraq-War,"Bruce Springsteen was once an intellectual ""good"" AmericanPatriot...with some kind of ""between the line"" lyrics. Todayhe seems to me like the male Eva Braun of country music fora total corrupt American war state...patriotic??? Sieg howdy!"
1,New Nick Lachey CD coming soon!,"Bruce is no longer the Boss. Today, people are now interested in Justin, Britney, Chris Brown, Pink, and Ashlee. Anyway, Nick Lachey is coming out with a NEW album real soon, and it's going to blow everything else out of the water. Wait and get that CD instead."
2,Dual disk format bombs!,"I heard the music and liked it a lot. However, when I got my ""dual disk"" home, my CD player wouldn't play it! In very tiny letters that blend into the cover, the producers indicate the disk is not formated like an audio CD and may not play on some players! Well, I got my money back and that sale was a lost one. I cannot buy a new player just because the production company is too cheap to make seperate DVD and audio CD in one package. Sorry, Bruce. Guess I'll not be able to buy your new music any more!"
3,Beware of this CD,"The music on this album is nice - if you can actually hear it. It works fine in my truck but won't play a lick on my Bose CD/DVD unit in the house. The error message says: Format not recognized. And lo and behold, in the fine print in the bottom corner of the back of the jacket (where everybody looks before buying a CD), it says this CD won't play on some CD and DVD players. So the question is this, Mr. Bruce: Why didn't you just make a normal CD?"
5,Bruce is no John Bon Jovi.,"Where to start..?Buy this album. It is one of the best folk albums I have ever heard. And they made it in New Jersey.New Jersey.Batten down the hatches, prepare for rapture. Things are not as we expected. I mean, this stuff is revelation.Now, I have always loved Bruce. Really loved him. Especially Nebraska, which I believe to be one of the greatest albums ever recorded. But this tops even that. Utter authenticity. Like 'Where Brother,' but even cleaner. And performed with sheer virtuosity. This is what real music sounds like.Let's just say that I doubt Courtney Cox is gonna get caught on film getting down to this.."
3,Bruce is not Pete,"Perhaps I did not read the discription correctly. I thought I was buying more of Pete playing and singing. I got Bruce. My mistake, I think."
2,Disappointing for Folk Music Fans,"I am a fan of folk music and to a lesser degree, a fan of Bruce Springsteen. So, I thought this would be a good album; I'd heard all of these songs before, covered by other artists, and my hopes were fairly high for this album. I was disappointed, though. Springsteen's versions fell short of my expectations. Unless you're a fan of the Boss, this album is one you should consider passing up.You can tell from the little clips here on amazon what the songs are like."
1,Another horrible record!,"Congratulations Bruce, you've put out the worst album two years in a row. I thought you couldn't get any worse after last year's ""Devils and Dust."" I was wrong, you topped yourself again. This CD is impossible to listen to. I'm so happy I didn't buy it and waste my money. If you want to hear music from Jersey that rocks and will make you feel upbeat, buy ""Into the Harbour,"" by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. It's a shame it won't sell close to what this will or receive any acclaim from the so-called critics. There are quite a few members of the Jukes horn section on ""The Seeger Sessions."" Too bad they wasted their talent for something like this.In closing, I hope Springsteen still has a good rock album in him. Bring back the E Street Band and give your fans what they want. ""Tunnel of Love"" was a strong album, even though it was mostly acoustic. Anything but this and your previous release. They make ""Nebraska"" and ""Ghost of Tom Joad"" seem like party records."
2,not all that impressive,"Bruce Springsteen was NOT meant to sing old style folk music. I'm a Bruce fan, and I didn't find this album very appealing at all. His version of ""We Shall Overcome"" is one of the worst covers I have ever heard."
5,"Brilliant, this is Joyful & Fun Music with an Emotional Resonance","Before I heard the album I saw the first rehearsal show in Asbury Park and from the first notes and sight of that Big Band I was hooked. To say I was blown away by this music and the show would be an understatement. This was the most enjoyable music I have heard in the last twenty years. Bruce was having more fun than at anytime I have ever seen him live and I have seen him live well over 40 times. Usually you have to be familiar with the music to really like a show, not with the Seeger Sessions. Ever song was a revelation, a new experience that took me into so many different worlds and emotional places. Bruce should put out a Live DVD from the Asbury shows to compliment the album. The songs really come to life in a live setting with an audience."
4,Gettin' Down & Gritty with the Boss,"This is really a surprise offering from Bruce. I am a casual Bruce fan but really love this departure from the norm. This is nitty-gritty folk music at it's best with the gravel-voiced Boss really getting his teeth into some auld folk classics. The beauty of this collection is that it is not contrived and there is no slick production here. This sounds like a collection of pals in a smoke-filled bar, jamming away and really enjoying themselves..Simple music from the roots...most enjoyable."
1,no excuse for this,"Why they designed this cd so it can't play on all cd-players is beyond me. I have a standard cd player in my 2003 Volvo which can't play this. There is a warning on the cd about this problem, but you wouldn't know about the problem until you bought the cd, saw the warning and then tried it on your own equipment. This one will be returned...pity."
5,Another dimension of Bruce,"Every time I think he can't get any better, he does. I have listened to ""Oh Mary Don't You Weep No More"" about 50 times, and only got the CD Friday! This man never stops growing and reaching for the next level. Some singers never get better, never try anything new, but not the Boss. His heart and soul is in every song he sings, and he has brought his fans a whole new level of enjoyment with ""We Shall Overcome."" To those who have criticized Bruce and/or this CD, this wasn't recorded for you anyway; it's for those of us who actually appreciate what music is supposed to be...an experience for the heart."
4,Go Jersey,"The new energy given to these traditonal songs is stimulating. Only two relatively poor cuts. The musicians assembled for this New Jersey session are excellent. Good work, Boss!"
5,Inspiring & Awesome,"I love this CD, can listen to it almost any time, even exercise to it to keep me motivated."
5,Two Greats--Seeger and Springsteen,"If you expect the usual Springsteen fare, you may be disappointed but Springsteen injects new sounds into the classics once sung by Pete Seeger. The cut of John Henry is the best of the album."
5,Thank God For The Boss,"This cd is the best recording I've heard all year. The songs are so good they'll have you singing along in no time, like you're sitting with Bruce and the band around a campfire. It's sentimental and sweet and moving."
4,Springsteen's Style Fits with Folk Music,"I feel like the Tom Joad album was Bruce's way of indicating which way he was headed. This album is that next step. If you didn't like Joad's gritty, consciousness raising folk songs, you probably would really turn away from The Seeger Sesssions. This is a classic folk music album in every sense of the word with great guitars and banjos, more simple rhythm sections, and back-up singers that deliver on the folk sound (i.e sounds like real people singing not over-produced or rehearsed studio musicians). The album is a joy to listen to- filled with real energy and passion that is essential to bringing the songs to life.Can you tell I liked it? While other folk singers may in fact have even better versions of these tracks, credit Bruce for bringing folk music to the fore like nobody else could."
1,BS's BS CD,Totally pissed. Bought the CD but can't play it on my computer or rip it to my hard drive. Why do I buy CDs again?
2,No more orders for CD's from Amazon,"I was unable to play this on my stereo system and could listen to it only on my computer. The description of its limitations was not detailed on the original site from which I ordered it. The music itself was awesome; Bruce is still the Boss for sure., but Seeger's material is still equally impressive."
2,Not for Folk Fans,"Bruce, you are a talented musician and my very favorite rock and roller. If you are ever tempted to do a folkish album again, collaborate with the Chieftains. They're masters at combining pop stars with the folk idiom cf Van Morrison's version of ""Senandoah"" on ""The Wide World Over"" CD.This Springsteen CD is overproduced, and Bruce, you are from New Jersey, stop trying to sound like you were raised with Woody Guthrie!"
1,Monotonous Nasality,"Wow, this album was terrible. I think BS picked one melody note and used it for the entire album. He writes in his liner notes how amazing it was that his band could sit down together and play the same song without rehearsal. Well, if he had ever actually spent time at any bluegrass or folk festival, he would realize that that's how it is done from coast to coast. This album seems to me to be a ""hook"" for another excuse to put out an album that might grab additional audience. Too bad it was so terrible. The musicians behind him were great to listen to. Maybe I'll find one of those gadgets that remove the vocals from an album."
2,How do you make it work? Now I found out. Should be 5 stars.,"I didn't give this a very good review initially because of having problems making the CD play correctly. As it turned out I was playing it in the wrong machine and now that I changed, it's great. Unfortunately I don't think I can change the stars I gave already.At any rate, it's so good that I'm taking it the next step and buying his Irish CD."
1,Why Bother?,"The trouble with most successful artists, and Springsteen ranks with the best, is that they fall into a belief that they can impose upon their fan base just about anything on the basis of them being ""creative"". This self-indulgent album lets Springsteen down badly and apart from diehard American country fans, won't rate elsewhere. Were I have to have one front tooth and a jug, I might find some joy in it, but I don't and I didn't. Next!"
5,A Girl's Story of Diabetes,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends WHY ME? for any youngster & their family who is living with diabetes. It is as bright & breezy as a Third Grader who is thrilled with being alive.It is also a sincere story of the dramas that rock their world: missed parties, misunderstandings with parents, teasing at school, talking things out about the emotions: fear, worry, frustration, anger & loss of self-esteem.WHY ME? is wonderfully illustrated & written, as well as an exciting story with something to say. A true collaboration between family members. It also gives some information about this chronic condition & what living with it is like.WHY ME? needs to be in every school, house of worship, summer camp, Boys & Girls club, library, clinic & hospital."
1,Cheap product at a cheap price,You get what you pay for. These flimsy protectors come apart easily. They are hard to put on and leave the screen hazy.Run away from here real fast.
4,Chemistry Update w/o Mathematical Rigor,"Enzyme technology? Molecular sieve? Nanotechnology? You'll find clear and illustrative discussion of these current topics in Philip Ball's ""Designing the Molecular World."" Though the impact of chemistry is ubiquitous, the author contends about the usual emphasis and coverage on physics, astronomy and biology. I tend to agree with this point as one might not even find a chemistry section in a decent-sized independent bookstore. Major chains would have one yet the selection is unfortunately poor with titles like ""Chemistry the Easy Way."" Ball also retells the discovery of buckminister fullerene C60. Don't be discouraged by the introductory physics remarks, you will find this book very interesting and open your eyes to the up-to-date chemistry research."
3,Not bad,"When Deconstuction arrived in Record Stores I ran to the nearest store a purchised it in a flash. When I got home, I found out that alot of her songs sound alot like the ones from Blurring The Edges. So technically it was like paying another 15 bucks just to get the same effect as her old album, but different lyrics. What I do like about her music is that she sings about all sorts of thing, love, happiness, peace. Not like so many groups these days that only sing about the girl/guy of their dreams, or things they want but can't have (ugh I hate that). Her musical genres are different and vary. Overall, if you are a fan of hers go out and buy the CD (but don't pay more that 13 big ones for it), or better yet tape it off a friend who has bought it, it's more efficient and less costly."
1,Deconstruction- the way her career is going,"Meredith Brooks dropped the ball big time. Her first self titled album was full of energy and great music. I waited with baited breath for her second cd (which Capitol Records took their time releasing). Can you say DISAPPOINTED? No energy, no great songs, just drivel. With songs like ""Cosmic Woo Woo"" you start to understand what happened... Meredith was enjoying the ride and forgot to be an artist. If you don't believe me, sneek a peek at the Quicktime video on the cd. There's no musican making music; theres a woman who looks shiney and sparkley in every video shot. I was hoping Meredith Brooks wouldn't be a one album wonder-- but it happened to her too!"
1,"Bland and ZZZzzzz, Oh sorry!!","This sucked!! Appears that Meredith just wants to look good now, so if she looks good who cares that the music sucks!! I thought she looked great during the BITCH session, should have stuck with that look, the music was better then!!"
4,Get this CD for the Great songs!,"This is a good CD, Not a great CD...However, it is a CD with some GREAT songs!Sin City, Back To Eden, I Have Everything, and Careful What You Wish For, are good enough to justify the cost of the CD all by themselves, and if you like the other songs, which are still pretty good, then that is just a bonus. I believe Meredith Brooks is too important of a song writer to not be working, hopefully she will get back to work soon and make another great album like ""Bad, Bad One"". If you don't have this album, really, theses songs are very good. If you don't know Meredith Brooks, Start With ""Bad, Bad One"" or ""Blurring Edges"" and fall in love with her rock music for grown ups!"
5,A Flower Growing Out of A Pot Of Popular Music Dirt,"Meridith Brooks is one of the most talented musicians I have ever seen, and it is a shame that she isn't selling the millions and millions of albums she should be! I love ""Blurring the Edges"" and this sophomore release was not a dissapointment. Meredith rules, keep it up baby!"
2,Brooks rules; Deconstuction Lacks,"I am a hugh Brooks fan and I have all of her cds, but this album is so unbalenced. It has too much of a range. That could be good for some people, but not me. I'm used to one kind of Brooks that sometimes tend to go out on a limb on some songs, but on the Deconstuction cd, it was too diverse. There are so great songs on this album, but I just think the few songs are worth buying the cd used. Love Meredith Brooks though."
5,For those of you who haven't bought this CD yet...WHY?,"How many more five-star reviews do you need to see before you realize that ""Deconstruction"" is a MUST HAVE album for your CD collection?Original? ABSOLUTELY! Poetic? YEP! Entertaining? FROM BEGINNING TO END!The layered guitars, inspirational lyrics, and varied musical styles are just too amazing to put into words. Whether you liked her first CD or not, Meredith has evolved into a woman who I think is the most talented artist working today (I am not even exaggerating)! Meredith is unfairly underrated. Give this album the chance it deserves, and call your radio stations and request her for God's sake! She is simply the best!When you hear ""Back to Eden"" you'll regret not buying this CD when it first came out.DECONSTRUCTION! DECONSTRUCTION! DECONSTRUCTION! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!"
5,Good Product,"Great way to bathe your pet in the tube! Easy to install and use. Make sure you have enough of the thread tape on the end of the shower water pipe to prevent leaks and you're good to go! Didn't notice any drop in pressure at all in the shower head. Only small issues were that the hose is a bit stiff, could be a little softer for better handling and a bit longer for when the pet runs to the other end of the tub! Other than that this is a great product for the price!"
2,"A ""labor"" to get through....","Some authors only have one book in them and I believe that may be the case with Mark Buchanan.His classic debut, YOUR GOOD IS TOO SAFE is tremendous. But the follow-ups, THINGS UNSEEN and THE HOLY WILD are more ""musings"" than well thought out works. I believe he really wants to write novels because the writing loses focus a lot and he enjoys telling stories but rarely do they add to the focus of what he's supposed to be writing about.This book sort of went on and on and on and on and never really added much to the need for a Sabbath. I recommend (HIGHLY!) Lynne M. Baab's SABBATH KEEPING. At 120+ pages, it has so much ""more"" to it than this bloated, unfocused book."
1,save your money,This is the worst book that I have read in a while. The author's thoughts do not follow a logical sequence in a chapter and he contradicts himself throughout the book. Save you money.
4,Encouraging and realistic!,This author gives us hope and understanding for keeping the Sabbath. The book is excellent and needs to be read.Perhaps more would keep the Saturday Sabbath if they understood what it is all about.According to the author what you do on that day is more important.
5,A book to read once a year,"I have a short list of books that should be reread every year and this is one of them. Mark is a wordsmith whose writing is exceptional and a joy to read. Add to that the outstanding content about the need for rest in our lives, and this book is a home run. Practical and empowering in its presentation and message."
5,A Moment of Sanity in a World of Chaos,"No one writes like Mark Buchanan. Don't read his books if you're in a hurry. This isn't tawdry self-help. ""The Rest of God"" is a singing, swaying, dancing masterpiece, an invitation into a new way of living; one where finite humanity is acceptable, and spiritual rest is the only prescription for the restless heart. Ignore it to your peril, embrace it to your everlasting gain."
1,"Mike Patton, what were you thinking?",This album is unlistenable! It is sad to hear Mike Patton (former guru of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle) degrade himself by trying to sing over the cacaphony laid down by this incompetent producer.Save money on this record by recording the sound of your toilet flushing on both sides of a 60 minute cassette tape.
1,Over-rated!,"I know that Kid606 has developed a cult following among the IDM crowd, but I find his music damn boring! He utilizes a lot of the same sounds (like the one that's akin to digital noise being flushed down the toilet -- you know what i mean!). The music is just really predictable after a while -- the same sounds are recylcled over and over. That's one reason why I love Autechre: they can't be accused for recycling the same old tunes. Anyway, this is basically a Merzbow meets Alec Empire meets Autechre album, but done in a really predictable fashion. But if you're really into this sound, I'd suggest picking up a Cex CD (Kid606's labelmate). Much more fluid."
2,For true fans only,"The Stranglers were a great live band but this album is really for true obsessives of the band only. In 1980 lead singer and guitarist Hugh Cornwell went to jail for possession of heroin. In his absence the other three members held two concerts at the Rainbow in London. To replace Cornwell they called in various friends to sing and/or play guitar. These included Hazel O'Connor, Toyah Willcox, Richard Jobson (Skids), Nicky Tesco (members), Ian Dury and Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers). As a result the album is unique in the history of the group and like no other live performance. Unfortunately only one of the songs really lives up to expectations and that is Jake Burns' growling rendition of 'Down in the Sewer'. The rest will be of interest only to obsessive fans either of the Stranglers or of those friends performing with them. If you want a true Stranglers live show choose 'Live X-Certs' instead."
5,Ingenius...,"There are few things, and few people I consider creative Genius'Rev. Brendan Powell Smith is one of them. I was first introduced to his Brick Testament several years ago on his website. I found myself smiling to the depths of my soul.I was overjoyed to hear that such would finally be in print. The book is wonderful, cute, intelligent...and endeavors to be Biblically accurate. Excellent for children, new christians, old christians, atheists, heck...this book is so cool even a Satanist could get away with having this version of the Bible on his living room coffee table.And at only $10 and change...what a deal!Perhaps my one complaint, and a minor one at that, is I loved and laughed so hard when I read these on the original website where they were marked with view ratings: V=Violence, N=Nudity, etc. I definitely can't wait for the next book in the Brick Testament series...""Stories from the Book of Exodus""=)"
1,Not for young kids!,"I bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas (He lives for Legos!). I ended up returning it before I gave it too him because it was pretty scary! I know the bible is full of violent things, but it's hard to see the minifigs drowning, bleeding, dying, being sacrificed and so on. I thought this would be perfect for a kid who loves legos, but I think it would have given him nightmares! Maybe OK for teenagers."
5,Lego my Bible!,"This brilliant work is artistic, entertaining, and spiritual--if you want it to be. It works for you if you think it's strange, or if you think it would be a great way to teach the Bible to your kids. I highly recommend it. As for the question of the author's motives--who cares? The book's wonderful and that's all that matters."
5,Fantastic!,"My favorite part of this book is the negative feedback it has received. Just skim through them real quick and take a gander--they're hilarious! ""Oh my heavens! This book depicts the Bible explicitly, and doesn't sugar coat its stories! It's therefore not for children!""Yes, because any good Christian knows that you can't be honest about Biblical stories with children because it'll scare the *hell* out of them! Or, wait; isn't that actually the point? ;P"
4,NOT FOR CHILDREN,"this is hilarious for adults, but the visual content is most definitely not appropriate for children. Specifically, I don't mind my child seeing an illustration of little lego men gambling or drinking. But sexual contact with a sheep? Nope!"
1,NOT FOR KIDS,"Would you give your kids the ""Family Guy Bible?"" Then don't give them this one. ""Reverend"" Brendan Powell Smith's gratuitous depiction of violence and sex is not appropriate for kids and in some cases not appropriate for adults. His interpretation of biblical passages is sarcastic and takes potshots at Christianity. He is an atheist, not a reverend and does not give a Christian perspective. If you are still wondering about buying this for your kids, take a look at the passages and interpretations of scripture available on his site:[...] Nothing by this author should have a ""For Kids"" stamp on it."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"DO NOT BUY! This is a shame full book written by an atheist who is laughing all the way the bank as he cons Christians into purchasing this book for their kids.I think most people just buy the book had it to their kids and never read it themselves or there would be far more negative reviews.I read the book to my kids every night for about a week and always walked away with a funny feeling because the message of the Bible stories was missed. Finally after the Lego depiction of rape, blood, and sexual scenes I did some research online and found out that this book was written by an atheist who is purposefully miss representing the Bible stores to deceive children.Several large retailers such as Sam's Club have banned the sale of the book in their stores.Shameful book of lies by distorting the fact and miss interpretation of the Bible.Best kids book I have found is:Jesus Storybook Bible"
5,Clever,"The author's use of legos to depict an often boring story helps readers learn and remember the stories of the bible. The author has depicted versions of many other parts of the bible as well, hope to see them printed."
3,Very readable,"""The Spiral of Shame"" is very readable with alot of examples, and would be great as a class textbook or for personal use. It will enhance relationships with friends, family and at the workplace. This book will help you learn to trust your feelings and have confidence in yourself."
2,"missed the point that women ran the temples, the misogyist of rome rewrote history as they wanted it to be","Author missed that the god's wife role was a middle ground role and myth. To the Romans women were confined to indoor slaves, killed as a warm up to a gladiator fight. Egyptian women built and ran temples as well as legal office. they new blood was part of life, seperate from unclean fluids. I'd hope that the author would catch this fact. Yet she asert the roman created culture of male dominated temples. She gets and f for history-herstory.C for clearlly written exercise and encouraging one to think about why they using this system and use it for the greater good. Find out through trial and error what they do, she doesn't give a clue."
2,If you love CK One you'll like illicit,"This smells almost exactly like CK One, except it costs way more. If you are on a budget I would recommend you just buy CK One. It is a good smelling fragrance, but for the cost you can find something that smells just as good for half the price."
3,"Alright, like the body wash better","I bought this after getting the body wash as a gift a while back. The body wash is awesome, feels so great on the skin and fills up the shower with the most incredible scent. Thinking that the scent was so great, I bought the cologne to match. This is not a bad scent, but is different than the body wash. This scent is a bit more powdery and feminine than the shower gel. Not a bad smell, has the citrus, ivy and tea scent which is refreshing. It stays on very well too, I can smell it all day.I love fragrances and have a ton, this is definitely not the one I go after often."
5,Enjoyed your Book and meeting you,"I've used several of Mr. Andrews suggestions, during play and have found his book to be helpful and easy reading. I enjoy conventional playing which he is a sole believer in. I'm a Bridge player and alot of this can be used in both games . I play both online and at many live tournaments. Thanks for the Book Joe! Joanie"
4,Great Guidline,"I Met Joe in Vegas at the IHSPA finals. I also had the discreet honor of co hosting this event with Joe. As stated to him in Vegas I feel this book is almost required to anyone interested in playing cards. Reguardless of the game spades or hearts, Most people will definatly get alot from these books. As far as trying to confuse them with bridge we need to remember that nowhere does it state in these books spades is at all similar with the exception of overall gameplay to bridge. Obviously someone diddnt either like the tourney in Vegas or felt the book diddnt make them a better player by reading the bottom message here. The bottom line is the book was done and is still a great source for general tips and strategys in spades and hearts. Those who feel diffrent maybe should just read Joes bio and see he never claimed to be a spades master :) Joe....keep up the great work ""Dusty"" Dave Spades Grand Master and 3 time NHSA regional finalist in spades."
1,THERE IS A BETTER VERSION,"Please don't be deceived by the title. This book alone is excellent. However, the newest book by this author, ""The Complete Win at Spades: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced"" is practically identical to this one. There are only minor additions that have no relevance to the strategy sections, I counted only maybe 20pages maximum of difference. NOT WORTH IT. All pasages are word-for-word identical. Please disregard this book and look for the new one. Thank you for your time."
2,sourly disappointed,"I play regularly in MSN's competitive rooms, and though I do not consider myself to be expert at anything, I do think I'm an advanced spades player. I was extremely disappointed with this book because I expected it to teach me something new and it didn't. The book consists of a series of example hands taken from real games. I was looking forward to reading how the author would have played the hands differently, but there's not much input except on the bidding. He really promotes conservative bidding. I found the book to be very basic, and though beginning and intermediate players would probably gain something from the book, I regretfully did not."
2,plastic/vinyl chair covers,"The product was not as I thought it would be based on the picture available on line - covers will serve fine for storage, but not for the every day use I was looking for to keep cats and their hair off the chairs. Price was was very low so I don't feel anything other than that I made an error in picking out a product and bear no ill will toward the maker - perhaps a clear explanation of the covers' usage would have helped."
3,"Cover works, but...","The product does cover the chair/cushion nicely, however, getting it to stay on the chair is another story - the wind blows them off. I tried using clothes pins, binder clips, etc. to no avail. I will not buy them again."
5,Not worth the price,"As the others said, it's a very thin and flimsy plastic, the kind used for disposable tablecloths.Most definitely not worth the price."
2,AllBoxes Chair Cover,This item wasn't what I expected. It is more a paint cover and I couldn't get it over my chair. I will not purchase it again.
2,too thin,Price ok but the bag torn sliding my mattress accross a carpet. What will happen across a hard mobing van floor.
5,AN EXCELLENT THRILLER!!!,"If you loved ""Flowers in the Attic"" get ready for this...The last line blew me away!!"
3,Evil and Creepy,"I have to say that certain parts of this book made my skin crawl. And I am use to reading some wacked out stuff. Dean Koontz, H P Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, just to list a few. But the way Saul describes death or the way some of the characters meet it is quite remarkable.The story itself wasn't bad, in some ways it wasn't complex and some ways I had no idea what would happen next. The one problem I did had was the antagonist. I really don't want to say anything without giving the story away. But besides that it was a good book. I read it rather fast.I would recommend this book and I will also read another John Saul book again, in fact I plan on reading Punish the Sinners next."
3,Good book,"This was a decent book, but definitely not scary. Though it did keep me intrigued enough to keep reading. And I thought the ending was implausible. But overall I rated this book a three as a good mystery thriller."
3,drags on,"This has been my least favorite of his works thus far. While it isn't terrible, it drags on. I felt like I had to force myself to read it, and that never happens with his works."
1,Pretty Lame,"The writer is decent but in this particular novel, he didn't seem much like he cared about it. This novel is based in South Carolina about a family that has never met their father's relatives but something causes them to leave their home in Connecticut (where the father's life has been planted for at least twenty years & his wife, plus 2 children know of nowhere else to call home) They arrive, meet the relatives, things happen & even more things happen but the novel just lacks any depth. The only interesting 1 is the killer. The characters are one dimensional...I will tell you that it does read like a bad-horror-flick."
4,The Unloved,"Kevin Devereaux awakens from a recurrent nightmare that his cruel mother is about to kill him. At that, the phone rings calling him home to his dying mother. Kevin had not been to the majestic southern estate in years, and his mother has never even met his wife and children. Now he is faced with having to return.Thus begins our story, and thus begins a wonderful tale filled with the usual Gothic horror images. The forces of nature combine with the human psyche to mirror and intensify the inner turmoil of the characters. Although the story is a little predictable, it is a wonderful experience, nonetheless. The images are crisp and clear, although horrific, and the characters are vivid and exact. This is one scary book!"
3,Just shy of great,"Just received the shower deluxe chrome in the mail. It took only 5 minutes to install and works great. The only disappointment is that the ""chrome"" valve is actually a cheap piece of plastic. If you are not careful installing it, I think the plastic threads will easily break if you screw it on too much. Careful with your installation! Other than that, it's great."
5,Best choice for cleaning your shower,"I purchased the ""Rinse Ace Pet Shower Deluxe"" so that I could rinse my large tiled shower stall. It installed in minutes and works perfectly. You just hook up the hose when you need it and rinse away all your cleansers off the tiles surfaces and it's sparkling clean. I would recommended this item for any household. The spray is gentle enough for your pets but strong enough for rinsing as well."
2,"Good idea, terrible choice of material","The attachment piece that goes between the shower pipe and head was easy enough to install and the hose and dog-bather part of the product worked great. The bad rating is only due to the fact that the fitting is made of plastic. YOU WILL STRIP THE THREADS. You might get lucky and install it without stripping the threads the first time, but at some point if you ever remove and reinstall it, the threads will get stripped. I was careful enough during the first install that it worked well and I didn't have any leaks. However, I just moved to a new house and when I removed the fitting I could see that some of the threads were a little ""smushed,"" for lack of a better word. Installing it in my new house was nearly impossible, it leaked terrible, and when I removed it to apply the pipe-sealing tape, I saw that it was irreparably damaged. Got a year of good use out of it, but why don't they just make the fitting out of metal??????"
3,Hard on your hands,"I bought a similar product that has the same type of shower head. It works great as far as water pressure and getting your dog rinsed down. If the connector is made out of plastic, then you may have problems with it cracking from the water pressure over time as mine did. I was able to find a metal replacement at Lowe's that works just as well. The shower head requires you to hold constant pressure down on the lever to keep the water flowing. After a few minutes, this makes your hand hurt and if you have arthritis in your hand or fingers, then you will not like this product."
2,Rinse Ace Deluxe,"I was extremely excited about the Rinse Ace Deluxe, when I saw it in the pet store. I was so tired of the buckets and standing on my head. It made bathing the dog a breeze. Unfortunately I have encountered the same problem with the cracked head. I too, would like to be able to keep the shower head on without having to hold the button down. I will check out the versions in the store now and see if there is a way to keep the head locked open. Any chance of just being able to purchase the head as a replacement?"
2,For my use...installing/removing the hose every time is a hassle,"For my use...installing/removing the hose every time is a hassle, I was trying to find another like the one I own, that has a diverter and the hose stays attached 24/7/360."
3,I didn't pay attention!,"I was excited that I was finally going to be able to bathe the dog in the basement laundry tubs instead of stuffing her in the small kitchen sink and using the sink sprayer to rinse her. However, since I didn't pay attention to the product description, I received the pet shower and was unable to attach it to my laundry tub faucet, so it was not useful for me. I have knee replacements and can't kneel beside the bathtub, so it would be of no use to attach it to my shower."
2,Low Quality .,"This will be the 2nd one I have bought. The first one cracked around the sprayer part for absolutely no reason . The prong that attaches to the end of the hose does not stay in place , it pops off easily. I bought a second one for the benefit of the doubt. This one has done the very same thing. We need a more quality product. Its flimsy. Not recommended."
2,Cheap construction,"This appeared to be a well designed product that worked fine at first. But it soon sprang a pinhole leak that has since grown in size to the point where the valve is a nuisance to use and leaks even when not in use. You may be lucky and get a good copy, but the cheap plastic construction makes it a risky proposition."
3,Not for (utility) sink use!!,"We were looking for a product to use in our utility sink (pet bath sprayer), and it is not designed for such use.So, okay, you'd think you could run to the hardware store and pickup an adapter fitting of some sort, right? Not! Evidently, you'd need a mechanical engineering degree to make that work, judging from striking out at 3 hardware stores...too bad, we were looking forward to the quick connect feature..."
