5,Grinder,"I guess they test each unit out so there might be some coffee grounds in it when it arrives. Sorry about previous statement. Grinder was great Wide range of fineness. For a 20 sec pour on my Gaggia I used 5 setting. Doser makes a little mess, but its ok"
2,Doser handle broke after a year.,It seemed flimsy and cheap but it worked ok until the doser handle broke just a month or 2 out of warranty. And we're talking about a grinder that was only used 2x a day at the most. Disappointing...And even more disappointing to see that the handle was made entirely of plastic. What lousy engineering. Don't buy it.
4,best espresso from this grinder,"I've been cheap over the years and always purchased a cheapie grinder. After using this one I see what I was missing. I've never been able to get the grinds small enough for espresso until I began using this grinder. Now my crema is the envy of everyone.There are 2 issues I have with this grinder. 1) the spring on the doser broke so now it doesn't go to the back position automatically. Not a biggie problem, it still works well. 2) there are no rubber feet on the bottom. The grinder slip and slides around my counter top. I stuck some rubber feet on it and now it's fine, but I wonder why they didn't do that in the first place?All in all, I still admit, this is the best grinder I have ever owned and I have never pulled a shot of espresso like this before."
2,A little shadowy,"Although the premise of the book is good, and the author does write well, I find that the book was somewhat self-indulgent and campy. He makes way to much of the coincidence that another Waterman (Johnny Waterman) liked to climb mountains. There is also way too much filler about other expeditions that have been documented elsewhere. And the last few chapters read like a camp journal.The book is best when the author details his life as a Denali park ranger. However,there is just not enough of that to recommend this book."
3,Pretensious Judgmental,The author falls into the trap of thinking that climbing is going to give him and some other fellow climbers an insight into life beyond that of the ordinary man.No doubt he has done some amazing things but the fact is when you get off the mountain you are the same jerk you were before you started. Being a great climber does not make you a better person than someone else.I thought the chapter about his winter ascent was really self indulgent. Under the circumstances of his physical condition he had no business being there.On the positive the author has a knowledge of the Denali area that is very impressive but ...
3,Nothing special for a winter blade,"I've owned winter blades before and this one is nothing special. It works just like any other winter blade. When I first installed them they chattered and after break-in they streak just like other blades. The important thing is the ice doesn't freeze inside the frame, the rubber boot keeps them flexible after a winter storm. I'm glad I didn't pay retail because then I'd be disappointed. But for the price I paid on Amazon, they'll do for winter use."
3,Not the best,This is the 2nd year I've bought these wipers. It's the last. I think the one's I received both years sat on the shelf long enough for the rubber to start degrading. They streak right out of the container. Not horribly but enough so that you can see little lines on the windshield. New wipers are NOT supposed to do that. Next year I try either the new Michelin's or Rain-X.
1,Crap,"Don't buy these. I bought a pair for my car in the 20 and 24 inch size and for my wife's car in the 18 and 19 inch size. I am sure these were the correct sizes but the blades did not fit either my window or my wifes window correctly. Only the middle 1/3rd or so of the wiper contacted the window and they did not work. I returned them and bought simple, cheaper, non teflon blades at a local auto store and they work great.Save your money"
2,Botti is Boring!!!!,"This review won't win a place for me as a favorite among Botti's loyal fans but so be it.I have to say I was unimpressed and disappointed in this CD of classic standards. It is a given that an Artist playing trumpet to drumless ballads has a huge hurdle to overcome to infuse some life into the music but Botti fails miserably. He drones on from song to song, with very little life or technical artistry displayed. This is smooth jazz at its somnolent sophoric worst."
1,What is this???,"Okay this is not a jazz cd. Put it in a category called easy listening. I call it boring. I call it uninspired. Call it what ever you want but don't you dare call it jazz. This is for all of you who want to say you listen to jazz but don't. There is nothing here of substance. There is no musicality here. Okay Botti might have a nice tone (frankly I think it is way to stuffy) but that is all. The is no creativity in the arrangements. Merely putting an orchestra behind you does not make the music musical. Frankly I think the guy is banking on the fact that some women think he is good looking. This really isn;t woth the effort. With so many great trumpet players out there, don;t waste your money on this."
1,no way,"As a trumpet player, I am not at all impressed. Chops? He has none, and frequently passes on high notes in favor of his background players. Wynton or Artuto Sandoval blow him out of the water in terms of dynamics, tone, and range. Not bad music, but Chris Botti is not a top tier player."
2,What's with the cover?,"I was browsing the new releases and saw an extremely odd cover to Chris Botti's new CD and I have to ask, what the *&%k??? I am more intrigued by the cover than by the music. It should really be hung and studied at the Metropolitan Musuem of Art. Is it homoerotic? Is she a vampire? Or is he blowing ""Blow it out your Ass""? Curious to find out...who is his agent?"
5,Botti is the Best,"9/8/2007. My wife and I saw and heard Chris Botti last January 28, a Sunday evening raw wind and freezing rain and snow, at the Chicago Theatre just north of the Loop, and again with Diana Krall at Ravinia just north of Chicago last Sunday evening, September 2, in the Pavilion with clear blue skies above. Both sell outs. Also saw him on Ramsey Lewis's TV program ""Legends of Jazz."" He is the trumpet's ""Frank Sinatra."" We have given his CDs to friends. Whatever others may think of him, my wife and I are sold on his use of his trumpet with this music. Terrific! Inspiring!! C. Yopst, Chicago"
4,Very Nice,"I love this recording. This is sumptious, luxurious skillfully produced pop music. The big shocker here...who knew Paula Cole could unleash a reading like the one she does here of What'll I Do? A truly relevatory moment that is the defining moment of this CD - beyond that, the rest is very nice as well. Enjoy Chris Botti, really enjoy the contribution of Ms. Cole, and enjoy the skill of a good producer at work."
4,Chris Botti with some beautiful standards.,Nice mellow tracks. Chris Botti plays these old standards beautifully.Restrained but very nice with some subtle reinterpretations.Great if you like old standards. My favourites - When I fall in Love & Someone to Watch over Me.
4,"Chris Botti ""When I Fall in Love""","Chris Botti is a masterful trumpet player, suspassed by no one. This is a wonderfully romantic album, perfect for easy listening, or as background for an intimate dinner party. I love it...."
4,musical diva,This cd puts me in love and I an transported to another place. This is definitely a cd for relieving stress.
5,Botti's Best,"A must have album for all Botti fans anyone that loves good music. In fact, I'm listening to the CD now for the 20th time. Buy it !"
3,Nice,"Nice is the best word. This is a pretty and enjoyble collection of mucis. Not Botti's best by a long-shot, not the best in the genre-but almost completely enjoyable. Really deserves 3.5 Stars, but with so many fan(atics) giving 5 stars(unwarranted) I had to go low. Nice-that is the right word, not great-not superb-definitely not bad, but won't represent Botti's gifts to newcomers. nor will it sufficiently charm the critics of ""smooth jazz"".""Someone to watch over me""-one of the best on the cd, ""No ordinary love"" somewhat weak. Check out ""Thousand Kisses"" for some great Botti work. Avoid ""December""-his weakest effort."
2,Unoriginal & Boring,"After buying Cris Botti's Night Sessions and A Thousand Kisses deep, I was chomping at the bit to purchase his latest, When I Fall in Love. Listening to it on the way home was the last time I took a listen. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Putting his spin on other songs was not the best career move in my opinion but judging from other reviews, it appears that I am in the minority thus my reason for writing this review. I have all of Botti's material sans his Xmas CD and his mix of funky pop trumpet and his muted horn sound a la Miles Davis is his trademark. Since I have jumped back and forth between smooth jazz's forerunner, fusion, smooth jazz and tradition hardcore jazz since age 17 (I am 41 now), listening to this was BORING. I hope that next time Botti comes out with something more original and a better mix of uptempo and love songs. In reading another comment on this CD, they (forgot the name) were right in that the better Botti was his previous 2 albums."
5,A very nice album for those who like trumpet and romance.,I am a professional trumpeter. This guy Chris Botti plays beautifully. I actually bought this album because a client of mine wanted me to play some tunes at their wedding like Chris Botti might. I listened to Botti's style and sound and enjoyed his playing a lot. My wedding job went very well and I have this album to partially give credit for the inspiration I got from it.
5,Chris Botti : The Legend,"Well, every so often a CD comes along that is more than fantastic, more than words can describe and more than a true work of art. This is it, and you better be ready for it. The renditions of these songs are what legends are made of and on this CD its song after song, in the end, Botti and Company leave you exhausted and asking one question, when is another new CD like this coming out. Sting,Dominc Miller, Billy Childs and the wonderful Paula Cole need to be brought back for an encore! Cheers PS: Botti is going rival Miles as he get older, its only a matter of time."
4,The CD I've been waiting for Botti to record!,"My favorite Chris Botti CD has always been Slowing Down the World. He has a certain sound that has been described as relaxing, peaceful, laid-back, romantic, etc. I've always been a fan of standards, so when this CD was released I was hoping to hear Chris put his own signature on these classics - I wasn't disappointed. Each arrangement is slightly different (5 different arrangers were used), but perfectly suited to the material. The listener is treated to covers of songs from different eras, different moods, different tempi, different accompaniments. Great stuff here - Daddy like.I look forward to another similar disc down the line, maybe next time without vocals. If you liked Botti's earlier releases (before he teamed up with Kipper, whatever that is), you'll enjoy this return to the late 1990's sound."
4,Great instrumentals/mood music...,Wonderful background music to do just about anything by. I guess I could have done without the couple of vocals but basically a good choice.
4,Beautiful,"In his later years, having long eschewed his cool-jazz past, Miles Davis was asked why he never played ballads anymore. He was reported to have answered that if he did, he was afraid he'd never stop. Miles' ballad style--a style and sound that made him famous--surprisingly had few disciples among his successors. Good for us, then, that Chris Botti finally and ably ressurects the Davis sound with this fine, mood-rich album. While one can argue with the occasional indulgence of the string accompaniment, Botti beautifully weds the phrasing of Kind of Blue with the lushness and romanticism of Clifford Brown with Strings. The album is top heavy with ballads, which is a good thing; Botti's up-tempo work needs a firm nudge toward the straight ahead. But all in all, this is a very listenable and compelling album. The title song is signature."
5,Great Album,"I think that Chris has pulled off another great album. His sound is so clear and has good tone. Being a trumpet player myself, i think it is an overall well done job. Sometimes when the day has been rough, i just pop in this or night sessions and just relax."
5,Chris Botti Music,The sound of Chris Botti is a special treat to my ears and soul. Great music To listen to and relax. Truly a great artist in his field.
3,Not his best,"This was the most disappointing of his releases that we have purchased. It did not have the range and versatility that we are used to from Chris.That being said, we will continue to buy his CDs--from Amazon, of course!"
1,Power outage takes out phone,"After two months with this phone, I'll be replacing it this week. We had a power outage today and our base unit no longer boots. I will say that we had a short period (30 seconds) with low voltage; however, this is the only device in my house that no longer works at all."
4,Unexpectedly Charismatic!,"The Rock may be the next Arnold Schwartznegger! To my surprise, the Rock is charismatic, well-spoken and will probably go far as an action movie hero. My children and I, who are fans of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, loved this movie also. The storyline wasn't too bad, the special effects were good, not too much blood and gore, the dialogue was decent, the humor was pretty good and The Rock was convincing."
1,Not pleased,Had this just under a year. As noted elsewhere the battery operation is only a few days. I suppose the battery option is good if you are taking it with while traveling but for contined use the battery is not practical. In addition the battery door broke off the first time I opened it. Now just short of one year of use the winder has quit working all together. Would not recomend this at the price paid for less than one years use.
2,Missing Manual Instruction for this product,"I bought this product 2 weeks ago. When it arrived, the product did not come with a very good condition. The plastic battery cover was broken. Also the inner plastic for the top cover came off. But I could fix that with the glue. However, the most critical thing was that it was missing the manual instruction. Without it, I did not know how to operate this thing which have with few switches on it. How can I get the manual instruction? Aside from that, the product design is good."
4,Fairly pleased,"Arrived as expected, very nice finish, easy to use and best of all the motor is virtually silent! The only change I would make is to increase the diameter of the insert that holds the watch so that it fills the entire wrist area of a men's watch. As it is my watch is not held tight and therefore flops back and forth as the winder slowly spins. This is not a problem but for the longest time I couldn't figure out what the slight thud...thud...thud sound was. Again because the motor is silent, and turns on and off automatically at regular intervals, I didn't know this sound was coming from the watch winder and I kept looking out the window wondering what was making the sound ;-)"
5,Everything you need in one place,"I've been knitting for more than thirty years, and I still found plenty new to learn from this book. Anyone who's knit for a while knows that you'll often find a cast-on technique you like or a trick for making buttonholes or a timesaving tip in a magazine or book. Unfortunately, when you want to use the trick, you have no idea where it was. FINALLY, all of those tips and tricks are in one place! You'll definitely want to keep this in the bag with your current knitting project."
2,Don't do it!,This product should be used only for aqua jogging and not teaching children how to swim. The bubble on top pushes the children in the water face-first and can be extremely dangerous.
5,Best Product out there for kids!,"Our daughters used the puddle jumpers and we loved them. Once they were around 50 lbs they could't wear them anymore and we were in desperate need of something else to help them swim, but that wasn't too bulky. These are perfect. Our girls are 5 and 6, so almost ready to swim on their own, but not doing it yet. I read another review about someones child not being able to keep their head up, so I was a little worried but ordered them anyways. Our girls have had no problem at all keeping their heads up. They allow them freedom to run and jump in the water and move their arms freely. I would say this is the next step up from the puddle jumpers for helping a child learn to swim in the proper position."
4,Friendship knows no bounds.,A genuinely heartfelt drama about 2 seemingly diverse characters whose crossing paths show them their differences while bringing to light tragic similarities that bind them in a deep friendship that spans generations.
5,A Storm in Summer,"Love Peter Falk movies starting after I watched in and Alan Arkin in ""The In-laws."" Have purchased the complete series of Columbo to watch this fine actor."
5,Works with 2005 Dodge Ram with camper shell.,"I bought this for my dad to use with his 2005 Dodge Ram pickup. He loves it and says it fits his truck and camper shell perfectly. He says it is big and roomy and he even went through a rain storm in it and it did well. He has only had it a for a week, so we will see how it holds up on his two month long trip up to the Northwest Territories of Canada. That should put it to the real test.Update:Well, he used it for two whole months up in Canada and it worked perfectly. He said it was a life saver. Definitely worth the money."
4,Texsport-tent,When I bought this I wasn't sure what to expect but I used for the first time on a turkey hunt. It did the job. It was easy to set up and take down. The weather conditions were very cold smewhat snowey with a lot of wind. The tent held up and when I was leaving I was able to load up the truck from the inside of the tent without any problems from the weather.
1,Junk!,"Bought this tent a couple of months ago to fit to our motorcycle pop-up tent trailer to use as a dressing room. First time out discovered that it is hard to set up as the tent is heavy and the 20ish foot poles struggle to lift the tent, even with 2 people setting it up. Also, the stitching around the windows and front door is pretty lousy.Second time out, one of the poles split and the metal ferrule split under the weight of the tent and this with 2 people setting it up. It was between 55 and 60 degrees when I broke camp and while tearing down this tent 3 of the pole clips broke even though I was using extra care in un-clipping them.Wasted my money on this one and would not recommend this tent to anyone.Junk!"
2,mini van tent,"disappointed in tent. takes 2 people to put it up. YOU HAVE TO THREAD IT through 5 feet of nylon on 4 sides. After we got it up the main ziiper would not zip, It cost us $20 to return it! Very bad design."
3,Texsport SUV Tent,"Go for this tent at best price! I fit it over my Hyundai Elantra (not SUV). This is a big nice tent that will require a second person to assist in raising fibreglas supporting poles. If you were only try camping once, this tent is WAY TO GO. Caveot: big tent is hard to put back into bag!!!!!"
1,Low quality stakes break,"The tent itself is spacious and has a number of nice features such as multiple storage nets. Without the rain fly it definitely leaks. No, it gushes. I doubt the rain fly would completely eliminate this, but cannot attest to that. My biggest problem was the poor quality of the stakes that thread through the loops and hold up the tent. In two nights I had two breaks at the top of the tent, which caused it to collapse each time. Unless you travel with a small saw to cut off the ragged edge so you can re-insert the segment into the next, this cannot be fixed. The remaining stake segments showed so much wear after two days that, no doubt, they were about to crack soon also. This tent is less expensive than other brands - but you will get what you pay for..."
5,Texsport Tent,"The tent was exactly what I expected. Even though it was 110 degrees when it arrived, I just had to set it up to see how it worked on my Honda CR-V. Looks like a great fit! We are camping this weekend, I can't wait to try it out for real!"
1,5 STAR as a STANDALONE tent,"The picture shows a Yukon/Tahoe type of SUV. My Nissan Armada is roughly the same size, but I could connect the tent to it as well as I had hoped. In fact, I gave up and used it as a stand alone tent, and it was actually quite good for the 105 dollars that I spent. So I am just keeping it rather than returning it. My Nissan dealer had a demo tent on display that connects much better (like a sock) with elastic around the edge of the whole connection, unlike the texsport which has hardly any elastic. But it costs around $275."
3,"Love the tent, but it has real downsides","+ Its large+ It fits over my SUV - Subaru tribeca+ It held up fine in 45mph winds.+ Nice being able to put the gear in the tent and have the bed in the vehicle.Major Minuses...- Tent takes a while to put up- Build quality is so-so at best. one corner has small pinholes in it where the seamstress stabbed through the fabric with the sewing machine.- When the liftgate is up on the SUV, the corners of the door stretch the material significantly and I have to put towels on the liftgate so it doesnt rip the material.- The rainfly is pretty small and does not cover much of the tent.- The heavy wind caused the zipper on the side of the suv to grind a large scratch into the car while it was gusting!"
4,Works Mostly With Full Size Van,This tent is half the price of the other van attachable tent manufacturer but a bit smaller. I used it for 5 days attached to the back of a Ford Van (E-150). Can't open both doors all the way but it worked fine to move between the tent and van or to get stuff in the van. It was like having a living room - we slept in the van. (Ordered elsewhere for a few bucks less.)
4,As expected,"We knew when we ordered this product that it had many small parts and was time consuming to put together. It took about 4 hrs to complete it. The pieces do frequently snap off while my kids are playing with it, but they are easy to snap back in.It's a fabulous toy for kids who love to play pretend. My 4 year old daughter loves it and plays with it daily acting out different stories. My 2 year old son also enjoys it, although not quite as much. I like that there are so many more rooms and accessories to buy in the future. It's an easy way to let others know gift ideas."
2,Keeps Falling Apart,"My daughters got the caste fron the grandparents. First of all it takes forever to put it together. My girls love playing with it. However, it keeps falling apart if you move it in any way. You think when you pay so much money for something like this it would be durable - but none of the Playmobil things are. We also have the house, and it constantly falls apart, too. It's sad because now both have broken so many times and are in pieces and my daughters don't even really play with it anymore."
1,Pieces keep falling off,"I bought this toy for my grandaughter's fourth birthday. Since it comes in hundreds of pieces, we spent a good part of the day putting it together. The pieces of the castle are constantly falling off and getting scattered all over her bedroom floor. As a result, some of the pieces have been lost. Many of the parts have sharp edges or corners and are quite painful to step on, especially with bare feet. For this price, I expected to receive a durable, high quality toy that my grandaughter could enjoy for years. Instead, we are stuck with trying to return our purchase, or having it fall completely apart in the next few weeks or months. I am so unhappy with this purchase that I am posting my first product review ever."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!!!,"I could not put it down. A wonderfully written book about an exciting president, with great photos included. I enjoyed it so much, that I started the sequel, Theodore Rex, immediately after finishing. I recommend it highly."
5,couldn't put it down,I hesitated starting this trilogy of books written by Morris about Teddy Roosevelt - all are very thick - but I could hardly put this first book in the series down - Theodore is an amazing man with a very interesting life - I'm on the 2nd book Theodore Rex now
3,"If you can buy only one: choose ""Mornings on Horseback"".","You can read my review over on the page for McCullough's book, ""Mornings on Horseback"". Like the title says, if you can buy only one, I would not recommend this one. But if you can afford two...While both cover basically the same span of time in TR's life, I judge McCullough's work to be the superior of the two. While it appears ""Rise"" may be slightly better researched, and the approach is a little more scholarly, the prose and detail pales when compared to McCullough's book.Overall, while a fine read for someone that wants MORE TEDDY, I would put this as a second or third choice for a new TR devotee. In fact, I would turn to a better book on different subjects first, before returning to TR and this book. Perhaps McCullough's ""Truman"", Massie's ""Nicholas and Alexandria"", or McFreely's ""Grant""."
4,Interesting personal view of a future president,"Very interesting in the enormity of facts about Teddy's early life and rise within the political arena of the time. This text was easy reading, and offered the reader a great opportunity to know him on a personal level, almost as if you were there with him. The author teaches about his subject. Very good presidential biography."
5,This book is a classic!,"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt is a classic of its genre. This book and the sequel, Theodore Rex, are some of the most intricately detailed, yet most entertaining, histories of anything ever written. I find no flaws with this classic whatsoever; the Pulitzer Prize and American Book Award this book received were well deserved."
5,The Best Biography of pre-presidential TR,"This book is the definitive biography of TR's life prior to becoming president. I have often told people that if it were written as fiction, no one would read it because it would be too far-fetched. The people spring to life, and the reader feels as though he were right there with them. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt is not just one of the best books on TR, it is one of the best biographies ever written."
5,Wonderfully engaging,This is a superb biography about one of the most charismatic and impactful US presidents. Mr. Morris does an excellent job bringing Teddy Roosevelt to full-blooming life. One of the few must reads to better understand important people in US history and the forces that shape the American character.
3,Great man,This book is filled with wonderful info but certainly laborious. It seems every conversation is quoted. Give me the Cliff Notes.
4,Biography Near Its Best,"An especially well crafted biography especially for those who know little about TR -- even us American History majors. This volume covers the rise of TR to the presidency (a second volume released in 2001 examines his presidency and after). Good balance between the human interest view of a very charismatic man and the historian's view of a rising political star on the eve of the 20th century. As the author quotes British MP John Morley: ""[Theodore Roosevelt] WAS America--the America that grew to maturity after the Civil War, marshaled its resources at Chicago [1893 World's Fair], and exploded into world power at the turn of the century. Historical Biography at very near its best."
4,Great Start!,"Morris does a detailed and credible job introducing this extraordinary president. This volume covers the time from Roosevelt's birth to his becoming president in great detail, including his marriage(s), his education, and his exploits in the American west. Strong start, I fully intend to complete the trilogy."
5,Shortest 773-page book I ever read,"A really fascinating biography; I often caught myself laughing out loud or reading to my wife an astounding description of some TR characteristic or adventure. I am amazed that something so well researched and full of factual information could be so entertaining! I did not want it to end and am looking forward to Thodore Rex, poised on my shelf!"
3,The Rise of Teddy Roosevelt,"I love Teddy Roosevelt. I cannot give this book a review because I sent it to my son in Afghanistan. When he tells me how much he liked, I'll pass it on."
3,"History BY Roosevelt, not OF Roosevelt","I can't disagree with anything written by other reviewers.BUT, to me, this book was highly flawed. Morris appears to have taken Roosevelt's diaries and supplimented them with some research. Nice, but not worthy of a Pulitzer Prize.There is little view of TR by any other person than TR.We learn little of his first wife Alice, and what she thought of TR, how she related to him, or what her family thought of him.We learn even less of his second wife Edith. Why did she ""wait"" for him and not marry before age 25 (when most eligible women were long since married)?What did Henry Cabot Lodge think of TR, and why despite their apparent differences pointed up by Morris?We learn precious little of TR's relationships with others -- just what TR did about or with them.This is a good book to learn about TR if you wern't familiar with his unique life and contributions, but not of TR as a person."
4,Fascinating Portrait,"When I got the idea in my head that I wanted to read a solid biography about our manliest president, Edmund Morris's name came up immediately. I was not disappointed. The book is well written and exhaustively researched. The prose is smooth and easy to read and as soon as I finished I wanted to pick up the next 800 page volume. I will definitely be reading the entire trilogy... eventually. ;-)"
5,deelighting!,Teddy's dynamism reminded me of Alexander Hamilton. This book highlights it does not wane as he moves forward. A fine book and example to the current day politicians.
5,Better than Theodore Rex,"I actually enjoyed Edmund Morris' ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" (the first book of his Theodore Roosevelt trilogy) better than ""Theodore Rex"" (the second book in the trilogy). Granted, I read the books out of order, reading the second book several years ago, and that might account for why I liked this book so much more. However, on the whole, I felt this was the superior book because it does so much more to define who Theodore Roosevelt actually was - before becoming President. What an amazing American figure! I highly recommend this read! Teddy's is a spirit that I wish to capture in my own life - a sense of adventure and fun in everything he did. From the earliest days of his childhood through his charge up San Juan Hill, his life was quite engaging - even 110 plus years later. I look forward to ""Colonel Roosevelt"", the third book in the trilogy, which comes out in a few weeks. These are Edmund Morris' masterpieces of biography, and a true treasure for Americans."
5,"Ask Good Questions, With Good Documentation & Earn Praise!","What a terrific book by a gifted writer whose book speaks volumes about him. The book was exceptional, in documentation of the endnotes, in making you want to read it without stopping and leaving you with more knowledge than when you opened it. Edmund Morris deserves all the praise, prizes and promotion by pundits of his work. I highly recommend it. Superb excellence simply superb excellence."
3,"Great Man, Great Topic somewhat dry","I have to say I was dissapointed with all the praise that I had heard about this book. Perhaps thats why I was a bit saddened with what I found. There is no doubt the book was well written, crafted and researched it just did not cover all the areas and aspects of this great mans life. There were forays into interesting tidbits and stories (the kind of history I love) but the connection to the overall story remained lost to me at times. It was an enjoyable read but I finished the book wishing I had a companion book to compare it to and fill out areas."
2,"A boring book, but once in a while a little interesting","Edmund Morrus tries to make The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt a great book, as he provides just about a whole written out recap of Theodore's (Teedie's) life. Theodore Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906, and there is only one sentence reguarding this fact, which kind of dissapoints me, as I was counting on reading a lot about him signing the many peace treaties. I gave this two stars, and choosing from Excellent, Good, Mediocre, Bad, Horrible; my answer would be in the middle of bad and mediocre."
1,I just couldn't get into In Trance,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Scorpions with Matthais Jabbs. I worked my way backward in the band's catalog starting with Love At First Sting. Blackout and Lovedrive are great albums, and I love World Wide Live. I couldn't get into In Trance, and I really tried to. It's lacking the energy and shredder guitar solos and melodies of the late 70s and 80s material."
4,First MasterPiece,"This fantastic album, released in 1975, was the Scorpions' 3rd album and definately one of the best they've come up with. With outstanding solos done by the great Ulrich Roth, brilliant and original rhythms and perhaps the best percussion ever on a Scorpions album, too bad that Rudy Lenners (drummer at the time) developed heart problems; and ,of course, Klaus sounds fantastic. Of the tracklist the songs that shine the most are the title track ballad, Top of the Bill (song about selling out), Dark Lady (sang by Ulrich),Robot Man (amazing rhytms in this one) and my personal favorite ""Longing For Fire"" (bass driven song).If you like TRUE Scorpions this a MUST, I wonder if this lineup would have stayed through the 80's ?"
5,The Title says it all,"If you are looking for angry, driving metal you won't find it here. Look at the title ""In Trance"". Soaring vocals, soaring guitars and superb duets between rhythm and lead guitars. For a change up the peppy and driving ""Robot Man"" which was the closing song in the concerts that made ""Tokyo Tapes"". It is clear why. There is taste of psycadellic reminiscent of the first album ""Lonesome Crow"". This album really comes into it's own when you have worked a lot of hours, achieved your milestone and are way too wired to sleep."
4,THIS IS SCORPIONS !,"One of their best albuns, although some songs are boring. THis was a higly creative phase of the band, and I hopo they had never lost the services of Ulrich Roth (who has a lousy voice, by the way! )"
3,Scorpions Better Not Get Into A Trance (3.5 stars),"Look, Scorpions are the best rockers, but this album absolutely not my favorite CD, and it never will. 'Dark lady' rocks, but it's better in live. 'In Trance' is a very good number. But next: 'Live's Like A River' is average. When you hear it for the first time, it aint bad. But it'll make you bored. 'Top of the Bill', the beginning is spectacular, but the Chorus is very disapointing. 'Living And Dying' is nice. Not worthless, just nice. 'Robot Man' is one of my favorite rockers. But 'Evening Wind' and 'The Sun In My Hand' really suck. I thought, Roth could better stop song writing. But he's getting better at the Virgin Killer and Taken By Force albums. 'Longing For Fire' is nice. 'Night Lights' is a instrumental song, and I thought that this is typically Ulrich Roth. Listen it more then just once and you start liking it. Keep On Rocking!"
4,Tragedy and Triumph,"This edgey drama about the hoplessness of poverty and drug addiction has the veiwer plunging into the depths of despair, and finally lifted into the arms of hope. Young David Wenham is inspiring as the oldest son of a hoplessly heroine dependent mother played admirably by Molly Parker. Wenham's range of emotion is surprising and broad for so young an actor. Keira Knightley is typically brilliant as the young boy's emotionally challenged friend and, unfortunately, his dark enabler. Knightley's character's struggle with her circumstance and the better angels of her nature yield a performance equally inspiring to those of Parker and Wenham.In the end, you are left cheering for the mother's apparent recovery, and wrenching decline of the friend. I'd recommend this film to anyone not already swallowing antidepressants. For those who are, see a nice romantic comedy."
5,A CLASSIC!!!,"THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH PRAISE ONE CAN HEAP ON SOMETHING UNTIL IT BECOMES EMBARRASSING, SO I WILL BE SUCCINCT - BUY THIS CD. IT IS BEYOND GREAT, AND IT REALLY SHOWS US WHAT A LOSS IT WAS TO THE MUSIC WORLD WHEN CASS ELLIOT PASSED ON. THIS CD IS JUST BEAUTIFUL."
5,Don't Call Her Mama,"Cass Elliot was my favorite entertainer when I was growing up. It was as rare then as it is now for a teenager to listen to music that would not drive his parents crazy. This album really had that cross generational appeal. With this self-titled album, Cass Elliot abandoned the '60s caricature to deliver a fine vocal album that has aged very well. All in the Game has always been the highlight for me, as well as the lilting Cherries Jubilee and smooth Baby I'm Yours. All in all this is a sophisticated effort. A major label like RCA would do well to keep this gem in print."
3,didn't meet expectations,"These socks don't have as much pressure/tight elasticity as other sock we have purchased. Also, I ordered brown and they sent black. It's a good thing they weren't very expensive."
3,its okay,"I am in sales, and im on my feet all day, thought these might help, nope! but they keep my legs warm."
2,NOT Comfortable at all,"I retain ALLOT of fluid in my legs....many days I have not ankles and they have kangaroo pouches under them!!I'm a female weighing 220 and 5'5""I ordered the XL sizethe first time I tried wearing them my legs cramped up after 6 hoursthe second time I tried them well my legs cramped up after 2.5 hours!!Andsaying they don't constrict at the top!!WRONG!!!!!!!!YES THEY DO!sorry NO GOOD In my bookif you can't tolerate wearing them they don't do any good!"
2,Loose in Ankle & Top Band Too Tight,"The Futuro brand is a better option, period.I thought I would try a pair of these to make sure I didn't have a better option in the same price range. The top band is too tight around the top of your calf, and the whole area of your foot, including the ankle, is way too loose. No pressure in the ankle area, which is kind of important in these kinds of socks. None of those problems with the Futuro's, which I wear with khaki's to work every day now.I've purchased 5 pair of theFuturo Dress Socks for Men, Brown, Large. My shoe size is 11.5 medium to wide depending on the shoe."
2,"Is ok on pressure, but rolls down your leg too often","The pressure seems to be fine from these particular compression socks, however, during the day, it has a tendency to roll down your leg causing uncomfortable pressure points mid to high calf. I only have problems with one leg, so I only need to wear these one at a time, which I don't think makes a difference in how the top rolls down.Otherwise, they seem very sturdy and have a decent amount of foot room. I have a large foot (15) and wide too (2E) and it fits in the foot and the ankle quite well. It's just during the day that these really don't live up to my standards, they don't last all day long without adjusting them."
3,Top band way too tight.,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews. The sock is amazingly well-fitted from the toes to the calf, however, the top band is way too tight. Even after cutting it a little, it is just too tight for all day wear."
3,When God Writes Your Life Story,"It's okay, I probably won't keep it on my Kindle after we have finished studying it, but you might love it. Some of the chapters are good, but some have the flavor of the perfect merry go round Christian life, and one even says that total surrender to God makes your life perfect. Yeah right, fine, but I'd live my life with God in a closet thank you, I would not write a book about it."
4,Thought-provoking,I'm currently reading this book and the first thing I can say is that it has presented different angles of God's plan for my life! It goes beyond the typical question - 'What is my purpose?' and makes you think of the unnoticed aspects and opportunities in your life that are actually part of God's own plan for your existence.
2,Degrades the Romulans,"The Romulans used to be my favorite Star Trek villains. I read the Rihannsu series because I thought it would be a fun exploration of Romulan culture and history. However, I barely recognized the Romulans in Rihannsu. The book degrades them and seems to radically alter their characters. The main character, Ael, seems too perfect, while the rest of the Romulans seem like a bunch of buffoons. Furthermore, the book radically changes Romulan history that just doesn't seem realistic. It's too bad - the Romulans as presented in the Original Series were fascinating characters who had both honor and deviousness. The Romulans in Rihannsu have little of either."
2,Not Star Trek,"I really hate it when authors make substantial changes to the Star Trek universe and call it Star Trek. The timeline in this book doesn't match the established timeline from the series and movies, too much emphasis is placed on new and unlikely characters, way too much of the story takes place in the recreation room (so as to give time to a new character), and too much emphasis is placed on using Romulan - excuse me, Rihannsu - terms to the point that our historical heroes don't even call the home planet Romulus (yet they start doing it again in the Next Generation?). Also, the story moves so slowly that you need the 4-book anthology for anything to ever really happen."
3,The Bloodwing Voyages,"I don't particularly enjoy the original series, and am not a great Star Trek fan.I thought the storyline was a bit laboured and the characters less than believable, as were some of the events.I wouldn't purchase another of this author's books."
5,I like this game.,I played this about 8 years ago but then somehow it got thrown out. I really enjoy the game and its lots of fun. Ijust dont like the need for batteries but I also got a special adapter for it so no batteries are needed.
4,Knitting refrence,I'm a novice knitter and found this book to be extremely helpful for my latest knitting project. This book was recommended by a friend and I'm glad it was recommended to me. I would recommend this book to anyone that is a beginning knitter.
5,The Blazers,"Puro Blazers is the Blazers first all-Spanish language CD and lets them revel in their own cultural roots, drawing on the deep well of Mexican-American musical tradition. The album came about as a result of the overwhelmingly positive response the band would receive whenever they would play a Spanish song during one of their live sets. In this effort, they use a medley of drums, banjos, electric guitars, bass, the tres, and bajo sexto which comebines to produce an enjoyable and culturally enriching CD."
5,Remarkable Compendium,"It's All Well and Good, a compendium of easily digestible, scientific healing techniques is suitable for anybody with a body. If you want a short take and an easily integratable approach to stress reduction--when it happens--order this book immediately. This volumn is filled with synthesized holistic healing solutions that anybody can remember and absorb throughout their day and life. This book is truly timeless."
3,small good for travel but a little too expensive,The spray rinse is a great color and really nice but smaller than I expected. We travel alot plus I am a hairdresser so it will get used.
5,You'll forget you're wearing it,"I was skeptical that this lightweight ankle brace would be able to provide enough support for me to play soccer in it, but I've been very impressed with it so far. I've hated other ankle braces I've had in the past because they restricted motion to the point where I couldn't run without sort of dragging my foot along. This brace provides the right amount of support and keeps you from rolling your ankle under you, but you will be able to move your foot up and down with no problem. Its so comfortable and lightweight, and I especially like that it only has parts in places where it needs to have parts. Its not like wearing a giant heavy sock like other braces, especially the lace-up variety. I would defintely buy this brace again."
1,Still have not received!,"I got this for my husband and ordered another magazine at the same time. The other magazine arrived a couple of weeks ago, but still no Road & Track! Bummer!"
1,So far $5 wasted.,I decided to try this magazine again after 15 years hiatus and found it was so far $5 wasted. The first issue had just one interesting article - everything else is lot of advertisement (much more that it was 15 years ago) and fantasy fodder for speed nuts.
3,road and track,the magazine is fine but I don't want the auto-renewal. I've tried to delete that but it still comes up with renewal. would you please fix this? thank-you geneva
2,The magazine is great. The customer experience is poor.,"I purchased the magazine to send to a friend as a gift.My friend told me he had not received his first issue after a few months. I called the publisher to inquire. They said the address provided to them did not have an apt number. They decided not to send the issue. I told them the address did have an apartment number, to which the customer rep replied, ""oh yeah, we'll get that sent out."" The first issue arrived one month later.I recommend Road & Track but not subscribing from Amazon.com."
5,First Issue Arrived,"I always thought that R&T was a car enthusiast's magazine that caterred more toward sports car than others. Loved it when I was a young boy and now, I still love the articles and track tests."
1,no like it,i did order this magazine in january 25 today is march 3 and not a single one and it says that i am gonna get my first mag in april 13 this is just not right and those guys just send me a letter saying that i can pay only 7 more dollars for another whole year wow i am canceling the order right now.
1,can't review it if I have to wait 3 months to get it,"It is a great pricefor an annual magazine subscription. The only problem is that it takes 3 months to get the first issue. I'll miss all of the new releases. By that time, I might be questioning if I should have stayed with Car and Driver. I am also not crazy about the auto renewal. I am aware that I can change this but hope I don't forget."
1,Road & Track,"I don't recommend! I ordered on 30 June, as of 31 July I have not received a single copy"
3,buy only for human waste,"This definetly isn't a good CD to start a Suffocation collection. Human Waste--one of their best songs--is the only worthwile song on this CD, all the others sound terrible. Tracks one through five have all been re-recorded and sound better on their other CDs. If you don't have Despise The Sun, Pierced From Within, or Effigy Of The Forgotten pick those up first. If it wasn't for the song Human Waste I would give this CD 1 star."
1,MLB Detroit Tigers Franchise Fitted Baseball Cap,"What was shipped was not what was shown in the ad. I wanted blue with white logo and all cotton. I got was tan, with an orange logo, and mesh, except the front two panels. I am disappointed, but am wearing it."
3,"Nice cap, but looks different than the photo","This was a present for my boyfriend; I ordered it online because it's hard to find a Detroit Tigers cap where I live. My order came very quickly and I thought the cap looked great, although it's a lot lighter than it looks in the photo. My boyfriend also mentioned there was a slight problem with the stitching at the front."
4,So good!!,"It's an excellent cd, i think that because I like to dance very much.. and Tommy really make me dance"
4,Very Cool,"Very cool, not too big not too small belt buckle, my boyfriend loved it. Very Western, and Texas-ish, which is what he wanted."
3,guitar magic,this is an ok release from a reformed classic 80s lineup. some of it is rehashed and has been heard before but for all of you guitar lovers Chastain is dynamic as always.
4,What a treat!,"It's always a treat to pick up a book by an author you're not familiar with and realizing by the third page that they've just become one of your favorites. LaFoy had me when the heroine refused to be ripped off by a client she did a drawing for (if you read this book I'm sure you'll mentally applaud like I did). Most heroines would just swallow their pride and accept whatever she got because ""it's for the children"", but not this one. She stayed strong throughout the whole book and never made any of the stupid mistakes most headstrong heroines do that makes you roll your eyes at their idiocy. She stood up for herself and it was refreshing. Oh, and the hero wasn't too shabby himself. My one complaint is that the ending was a little too easily wrapped up."
5,Excellent Historical Romance/Fiction,"IMHO - This, is an intelligent, well written book, and more than a pleasure to read! The storyline, settings, timeline, hero, heroine, and secondary characters are interesting, original, and well developed by the author. Each character, is distincly set apart, yet wonderfully interwoven, in a compelling story, rich, in well huned prose. I could not, put this book down, reading through the night. I was never so happy to purchase a book - I will purchase the rest of the trilogy to discover the fates of Adrian and Barrett."
3,fun but fragile,"While this is a fun game to play with, this is our second one that we had to purchase. You will enjoy the games, just don't expect it to work for years to come."
4,Ms. Pac Man,"This is a fun item for the whole family. Because there are several games, there's bound to be one for everybody. My favorite is Mappy. Sure, Nintendo and Game Boy's are fun, but the Plug N Play games are a lot of fun too and cost less money! Gives you the old arcade feeling!"
1,Not worth the price,I would recommend that anyone who orders this game get assurance from the seller that it actually works. I got my game today and it doesn't even work and I paid [...] for the thing.
1,Unsatisfied Customer,I bought this item new and the cord had a shortage in it. Bought a used one b4 and it was the same thing but only cost me $20 so I figured by purchasing the new one ($90) it would not have this problem but obviously it did. Couldn't even get a good weeks worth out of it.
3,"Great music, poor sound","If this review were of the music alone, it would be 5 stars. But some of the tracks on this disc are obviously old recordings, and the sound quality is not very good. There also is quite a bit of distortion on some tracks during the louder moments. This doesn't totally ruin the disc, but the bad sound certainly distracts from the beauty of the music."
4,Decent mini fridge,"I bought this for my office and have been please with it. The size is perfect and the selling point for me was the freezer.This is used primarily for lunches, beverages and condiments and I haven't had any issues with freezing anything that was not meant to be frozen.The downfall is the drawer on the bottom. It leaves little room for bigger items but could easily be removed if necessary.Overall, a stylish, functional, compact fridge that is perfect for an office or to create a small kitchen area."
3,Danby Refrigerator,Have really not had a chance to test the fridge totally but happy with appearance and features so far.
4,Great for fine hair,"I have fine, mostly straight hair. I've been growing it out for a year and the disadvantage is that fine hair doesn't really have a lot of volume. Using this shampoo (with the same brand conditioner) increased the volume of my hair significantly. I recommend it."
1,Not good for fine hair,"I have very fine, naturally dark blonde hair, which is prone to damage and getting split ends and breakage. I occasionally dye my hair and it cannot take much stress at all. This shampoo did give decent volume, however it has sulfates in it, which apparently causes issues and damage to my hair. This shampoo made my hair frizzy and increased my fly-aways. Whenever I would use it, I could never give the fly-aways to tame down, even after using Redken Anti-Snap leave-in treatment. I think it would be fine if you have naturally thicker hair with a stronger hair follicle, but my hair just can't take it. I would recommend that if you have fine hair with a tendency toward breakage, try the Abba or Kenra product lines. For flyaways, I would recommend Redken Extreme Anti-Snap. They do not have sulfates, which can lead to breakage and are in most shampoos on the market today."
2,Not impressed,"I love many products of this line, but have not cared for the shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling dry and dull."
2,Extra flat shampoo,"Do not buy this if you want volume. I chose this over the regular Big Volume shampoo thinking it might be a little better. This shampoo left my hair very soft, but very flat. It is also harder to brush your hair out after using this. The product is also clear and smells a lot different which didn't matter to me as long as the results were good, but they weren't so I'm returning the extra bottle that I bought."
1,Not Big Sexy Hair!,"I almost always read the Amazon reviews but for this product I did not. I have been using it for several years and knew I liked it. So when I saw the great price on the big bottle I ordered it.I was surprised when I got it to see it was crystal clear (Big Sexy Hair Shampoo is creamy) and had a fragrance to it. In addition, the label had some of the lettering coming off. I got online, read the other reviews and printed out my return label. This is not the genuine product."
1,SUCKS BAD!!,"THIS STUFF SUCKS!! IT MADE MY HAIR VERY DIRTY LOOKING,AND FLAT,I BOUGHT MINE AT WALMART FOR 10.00A BIG WASTE...DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID"
3,Riding the WIld Surf,"Without a doubt, ""Blue Crush"" has some of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring shots of surfing ever-recorded on film. But these shots do not a film make. There must be dramatic tension and concrete story-telling in order for any film to be considered successful.The director, John Stockwell and his writer, Lizzy Weiss have fashioned ""Blue Crush"" in such a way that the whole enterprise is targeted towards the conclusion: the surfing contest. Some of what comes between the beginning and the conclusion are fairly interesting and the actors: Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriquez (always impressive and strong), Sanoe Lake and Matthew Davis all do a good job. But there is a nagging feeling that during most of this film Stockwell is merely marking time until the surfing contest and even that does not have the drama and catharsis it should have."
1,"Just what we need. Another trite, contrived surf movie.","May I just say, the simple fact that this movie is rated with 5 stars from the onset makes me physically ill. Canned acting, an uninspired script, and the notion that we now get to look forward to ANOTHER three years of copycats spawned when this monstrosity inevitably attracts the same disenfranchised groups as Eminem and Pluto Nash, make me sincerely wish that the director had simply ended his own life before mass-producing another meaningless addition to the already lackluster screen collection.Though if you want a cheap skin film, this would be your top choice. You listening, hordes of 15-year-old guys with too much time on your hands? Save us all..."
3,I love surfing but I didnt love blue crush....,"Blue Crush is a far cry from such great surfing movies like,Pointbreak,Endless summer,Surf ninjas etc. It gets two thumbs down."
1,"Laim,typical, boring.","I do not understand why movies like this get made. It is predictable the actors do not know how to act.Very mainstream,Scammainstream.......... Warning for surfer lovers only."
5,blu-ray ... crush,dvd looks and sounds great ... bd looks and sounds a lot better with the higher resolution ...bd sound is awesome with Immersion qualities beyond ... bd picture looks like it was monkeyed with for the format and not with the best results; but still better than the dvd except for a clarity in shadow and texture which would have been welcomed on blu-ray ...so we have waxworks and a soundscape power thats off the charts; and saves the sale ... get it; it's a great and goodlooking surfing babes vs reality and some tasty waves film ... and it's well made
3,You Go Girl......,"An attractive cast, led by the charming Miss Bosworth, does the best they can with the dopey old ""poor girl striving to become a star"" storyline that has been a staple of the movies from the silent era through A Star Is Born, Flashdance, etc.; and reappears in some form or another just about every summer. So what? This one is done with a sense of fun and is ably boosted by the terrific surfing footage shot over, under, around and through the big waves of Hawaii.Beautiful girls, handsome guys, gorgeous Hawiian beaches and terrific surfing. Summer entertainment to my mind, done very well. 3-1/2 stars."
3,Okay,"""Blue Crush"" tells the story of an extremely talented female surfer and her quest to overcome her fear of drowning, being the best female surfer out there, raising her little sister, making rent, and finding love on the beautiful shores of Hawaii.I was neither disappointed, nor enthralled with this movie. What was most interesting were the surfing scenes and learning about a sport I knew nothing about. The overall storyline is okay, but it lacked something. There seemed to be some holes in the plot. We never really understand why Kate Bosworth's character's mother disappeared other than she found a new boyfriend. I know it happens often, but it just seemed far-fetched that her mom just up and left and nothing is really said about it.If you're interested in surfing, watch this movie. If you're a guy who likes to look at women in bikinis, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. All others could probably find something else to watch that will interest them more."
5,Great Hawaii Video!,"This is a great video if you love the tropical scenery of Hawaii. The storyline and acting is good. And the music is well chosen the the different surf scenes throughout this film. Basically, it a fun movie!"
2,"Nice photography, lousy plot","Well, the girls in the film were alright, other than that, there's not much else to say about this shallow plotted movie."
1,"This Movie needs to be ""crushed""",This movie was horrible. Other than the surfing scenes this movie stunk! I expected so much more from this movie! This movie has a weak plot and the acting is BAD! Don't waste your money!
3,Should have been better; Hawai'i's Sanoe Lake great but too much sterotyping!,"Hawai'ian male youths take a beating inthis haole made film from Hollyweird.It is very well acted and filmed, butcome on Director and Producer, the younghawai'ian males in here are made out tohave 90 I.Q.s like that idiot @ 1600 Penn.Ave! What young hawai'ian male doesn'tknow about the Pro Bowl and it's players?That QB dude in here looks pretty wimpy,is it Marc Bulger? 'Some hockey player'?! Dumb line. Kate Bosworth is OK butSanoe Lake is better (and can reallysurf!) Aloha Blue Crush..."
3,Blue Crush Crushes Girls Everywhere,"Blue Crush - Good surfing movie, injustice to females. What was up with this movie? You had three kick butt girls in the beginning, especially Kate Bosworth and then everything went downhill, and I'm not talking about the shotty face-placing or the loser ending. They made the lead to be all about girl-power and then in the mid-last part of the movie she doffs all of her I-won't-take-any-crap attitude and dons a sexy dress like all the other gold-diggers. To top that off, she goes hysterical and asks her jock boyfriend what she should do! God, making women look pathetic never looked so crushingly easy."
4,Great father / daughter flick!,"This rocks. I saw it first while in a S. CA surf shop (Hobie) where a bunch of teenage girls were watching it. I bought it for my 7 yr old surfer gal daughter. OK my 9yr old son likes it too. I love the positive and strong young female roles. Too many movies (all?) have young girls as secondary figures that are not strong or able to operate on their own - NOT this one!. My daugher and I enjoy watching it for the cool waves, the ""easy"" story and the true fun! Even though she is 7 she totally relates to the decisions the good girls and not so good girls are faced with and it is a great chance to cuddle, have fun and even open the topic of how to make the right choices while being a strong free minded young lady with looks, brains, determination, power and options!"
3,"Fun, but predictable and a tad boring","BLUE CRUSH is a very basic plot formula, saved by impressive ocean shots. Everything about the movie was predictable, and we even sped up some scenes just so the movie would finish sooner.A movie for teenagers only who dream of being surfers."
3,"Good movie, bad extras..","This movie was ok, I would recommend it to people when there is really nothing else to watch.It was about this surfer girls, and one of them (Mary Jane) wants to go pro. So she has to win this pipe masters competion. And people die at this pipe, so shes been in training with her friends. She then falls in love with this football player who wants to take up surfing lessons. She spends more time with him then her training, So can she win? Watch to find out more..This movie is better than it sounds.. But acting wise, it's not the best. I personally think that Michelle Rodriques did the best followed up by Kate Bosworth, but people can think what they want to think.All and all this movie was ok, there wern't any good extras, so I give it 3 stars, which is good these days. Most movies that real critics give out is a 2 star. But I thought this movie desirved 3. It's funny..yet romantic..and sweet."
4,Blue Crush- A great chick flick,"I must say that this was an awesome film. My friend Mathew, a 14 year-old kid, loved it from DK. I loved Blue Crush, and it was great. My God, Kate Bosworth is gorgeous and so is Michelle Rodriguez. The great surfing scenes truly helped out the movie, and I must say John Stockwell does a great job of directing this film featuring spectacular surfing stunts. The film is beautiful, and just simply amazing. Blue Crush, was the best!I love Kate Bosworth, and I love the movie. She is so pretty! I would definetly see Blue Crush, in theatres August 16th! My friend Mathew loved this movie, he would recommend this movie as well. I must say you should see this film! Blue Crush is rated PG-13 for Sexual Content, Teen Partying, Language and A Fight. So not a terrible choice for the kids. So see Blue Crush if you know what's good for you! See BLUE CRUSH! You'll love it!`"
3,This is It!,"Ok, so a girl named Ann Marie (Kate Bosworth) wants to become a champion like Rocky, but in a surfing competition in Oahu. Admirable. The Bonzai Pipeline is extreme, but will Ann Marie overcome her fear? You bet! She's got Michelle Rodriguez on her heels like a drill sergeant. ""This is it! This is it!"" Don't let your personal life interfere with business. C'mon now. Let those football players clean up their own vomit. Where's Steven Seagal when you need him? He could pass as a Hawaiian and played a Buddha easily. Go over there and call those mean guys 'CSFPAHs!' and toss them around. You'd think this movie is a chick flick, but ""Blue Crush"" has decent surfing scenes. ""Point Break"" was better, but ""Blue Crush"" compares itself to ""North Shore."" Yes, to the reviewer below, I have seen that movie and yes, Nia Peeples was extremely hot in that movie. Now, everybody see this movie."
4,One of the better surfing movies!,"This is one of the better surfing movies out there. Some of the scenes are the best surfing footage I've seen. The story can be a bit better, but the overall premise isn't bad; too bad there isn't a real Pipeline Masters for women, simply because they don't get enough sponorship and respect in the surfing community. The other surfing movie I would recommend would be ""In God's Hands""; not as mainstream as Blue Crush, but for the lack of better surfing movies, these two will do."
3,better than i thought it would be,"blue crush could have been a lot better than it was, but i admit, i liked it. the camera work is really well done, the plot is fairly decent, but acting could have been better. could have done without the one local surfer guy (""drew"" maybe?). everything he said was totally monotone. but if you watch the special features it says he's not an actor but an actual hawaii local that they hired for the movie (which explains his poor acting skills). all in all, it was better than i thought it would be. and if nothing else, it inspired me to get a membership to the gym so i can try to get a bod like kate bosworth..."
4,Another death metal classic!!,"A great album, yet I still have a few gripes about it...First with the pluses. This album is heavier and faster than Onward To Golgotha. The evilness of their fast/slow attack is still intact, the vocals are still brutally inhuman, and some of Incantation's best songs are on this album, such as ""Emaciated Holy Figure"", ""Nocturnal Dominion"", ""Blissful Bloodshower"", and the epic ""Abolishment Of Immaculate Serenity"" are all found here.Now with the minuses. The production sounds evil, yet really muddy at some parts. The drums (the kick drums in particular) are also kind of buried in the mix throughout the whole album, and the drumming itself is rather bland. They would've done better with someone who wasn't a sessions musician in my opinion, maybe they would've put a little more effort into it.Either way,this is still a good death metal album for those of you who like their metal brutal and blasphemous."
4,"Can you say low, LOW vocals?","I've been a Death Metal fan since I got into Cannibal Corpse back in 1991. Incantation was a band that I never really got the chance to get into, for whatever reason. I decided to buy this one. I must say, it is good. I love it, because I was looking for dark stuff, and this definitely fits the bill. My one tiny complaint is that the vocals could have been better mixed. As it stands, even while reading the lyrics and standing real close to the speakers I can't quite decipher the words. Again, not a big issue - I love Craig's vocals precisely because they are quite possibly THE deepest, lowest ever. But, I would've bumped them up higher in the mix, and/or tweaked some EQ to make them stand out more. Other than that, like other reviewers have said, this album is as Death Metal as it gets. Old School, baby!"
1,Painless Spanish,"Don't buy this book unless you just want a little history lesson. Dr. Vega and the publisher Barron's must have had some time on their hand and some left over data from some other book. This is not a good text book for any student. It is filled the same old words to use, and the historical parts are not that interesting. Be very careful when a lanugage book title has words like: ""Painless"" - ""10 Minutes a Day"" -""Dummies"". I suggest that you always come here to Amazon and read reviews on language books. Don't waste your money on shortcuts.Adiós doctor Vega. Por favor, trata otra vez."
2,"Lastima! (Translation: ""What a shame!"")","I've only reached page 37 of 278 but have already spotted a couple of typos (""cleaniness"" being one of them). Here's the whopper, however: The author, Carlos B. Vega, Ph.D., is trying to explain how we pronounce the 'v' in English: ""With the 'v,' you make contact between the upper lip and the tip of the lower teeth. . . .""Utter nonsense. It's the reverse: the lower lip makes contact with the upper teeth.Why do I now hesitate to continue reading this book any further? Where were the copyeditors? It's sad when a well-intentioned author and publisher shoots himself, herself, and itself in the foot. The Spanish in this book may be painless; the English certainly isn't."
2,You'll need a dictionary to get through this book!,"I made the mistake of taking this book with me on an airplane... without a Spanish-English dictionary! There were words in Lesson One that I couldn't translate. There's no glossery so you're on your own.This book could have been made so much better by adding more definitions and explanations.This is definitely not a beginner's book, and the typos make me wonder how much of the Spanish instruction might be incorrect."
1,A Painful Experience,"Unlike how this book is marketing as ""painless,"" this book is just another in a series of Spanish books that requires more than just effort as it purports, it also requires a basic knowledge of Spanish to really begin to effectively use this book. The presentation is haphazard, one of the first passages in the book is in Spanish that requires a Spanish dictionary as the book doesn't include its own glossary. There are better and more user-friendly books out there. Don't bother with this book if you are a beginner. And look before you buy if you are an intermediate student of Spanish."
4,"Facilitating approach, for a FALSE beginner !","A 276 pages of text in 13 lessons.Even though the book is directed to middle school student , the approach used makes it a good starting book for an adult who wants not only to speak and write spanish but also understand the culture.The approach is a CONTEXTUAL approach in its general meaning : word in a sentence, sentence in a paragraph , a paragraph in a short reading selection, a reading selection within a famous book, the book within the spanish literature, the literature within the country history.Every lesson includes pronunciation, grammar, history, culture,vocabulary. Here are the author's words : "" Each of the 13 lessons is divided into 9 main parts or sections,with titles given in both Spanish and English ...""Why the 4 stars : a number of typos which can be detrimental to a real beginner ; for example on page 21 : un Fuen fin instead of un buen fin.For a false beginner , it is a very good approach ."
1,Not good at all!,"Spent time learning adjectives, nouns, predicate,subject, and other things U learn in a grammer school textbook! No spanish!"
5,I like this book,"I like this book. There is alot in there that may not neccessarily agree with a 20-something year old woman and her lifesyle. But a real stylish woman will know how to adapt it to her own lifestyle. Besides, Genevieve stresses that all through the book. She also stresses quality over quantity which may seem like common sense but it is not all that common. Also, she indicates key pieces a woman should have in her warddrobe to look stylish and elegant at all times with relative ease. Oh how I wish I had bought this book 5 years ago. Then I would not have wasted my money on all those cheapies, purchases from clearance sales and of-the-moment purchases which I never wore for long or did not work with anything I owned already. At least now, I have a guide when I walk into a store as to what to stock and what to leave in the store. Very good book!!!"
5,timeless advice every elegant women should have,"in a time of fashion where ""anything"" goes, it is truly refreshing to have old school rules of elegance to fall back on. That said, alot of the advice in this book could be considered ""dated"". However this book can truly help in those critical times when one wonders ""what would be appropriate/ elegant to wear in this situation"". Most of the information is very valuable to any woman of any age who feels her style is in need of some improvement. Especially to women who want to send out the right message to society. For any woman who has wondered how the french woman can be so elegant at all times, this book is truly a dream-come-true."
3,Helpful but dated,"Follow all the rules in this book and you will be the most elegant women of your day -- if your day was the 1950s. Advice like an elegant woman never wears black in the morning just doesn't fit the needs of a professional urban woman (like me) who has several black suits in her closet. And this book isn;t trying to help you develop an interesting flair of your own -- this book's goal is to give you the rules to follow to be conservatively tasteful in all occasions. Still, it's helpful to know what the most absolutely proper thing to wear is, if only to decide how far from absolutely proper you want to veer."
3,"Eternal principles, outdated details","The principles of good dressing are eternal and well expressed here...dress for your body and not for current trends, quality over quantity, terrific basics accessorized with high quality goods make for an elegant appearance.However, the details are more appropriate to the last century, or even the one before than this one. After several witty introductory chapters, when the author discussees an ""essential wardrobe"" it is clear that these are essentials for a woman of leisure who, perhaps, lives in the 1950s. How many of us change several times a day...for morning, afternoon lunch, cocktails, evening wear?I can well imagine that Queen Elizabeth nods in recognition at these recommendations. For modern, working women, this is charming, yet impractical advice for day to day living."
1,Hopelessly outdated and utterly useless,"This guide would have been appropriate to women in the 1950s with a much higher than average income, but in today's world, it is absolutely ridiculous. I read through the entire thing hoping for some redeeming gem of wisdom, only to be continuously disappointed. The author gives the impression of thinking that she is better than everyone else, and that people who cannot afford to have a custom-made wardrobe do not care about themselves. If this snobbish attitude is what elegance is about, then the world needs a lot less elegance!"
2,Rather disappointing--40-year-old text without much updating.,"While wearing more than one color at a time may have been considered risque in the author's time, wearing black and brown together is no longer the scandal she claims it was.There are some useful points in this little book, but the author's continued insistence that one wear beige and wool (even in the summer!) quickly becomes tedious (particularly to those of us who, due to allergies and skin conditions, cannot wear wool under any circumstances).And given the English penchant for dressing frumpily, it is a wonder why she continues to refer to the English as masters of taste.The sad truth about any book like this (and this is no reflection on this book or the author) is that those who need to read it the most (the deliberately shabby and poorly groomed) are the least likely to read it."
4,A MUST FOR EVERY WOMAN SEEKING ELEGANCE,"Written forty years ago, this book is a must for any woman seeking guidance on timeless elegance. The author has a witty and charming way of keeping the reader engaged throughout the whole book. Anyone looking for a Audrey Hepburn ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" guide to elegance really should take a look at this one."
4,I would highly recommend it,Its great ! Easy to read and very entertaining . Timeless . Though a bit outdated at times . But you can always take the bits that work nowadays .
3,"A little dated, but the principles are classic","This guide gives insight and tips on how to become a more elegant woman. Gives tips on everything from clothing, cosmetics, food, pets and etiquette in general. Some 'rules' may be a bit old fashioned and mature for a woman in her late teens-mid 20s [like myself], but nonetheless it's good book to read when there's nothing to do during summer break."
2,Quaintly charming,"Written for a different Age, but contains some pearls of wisdom, memorably my new motto ""I can't afford to shop cheaply"". Worth the price."
2,Time Warp,"I purchased this book because occasionally I am required to present myself in an elegant manner. This book was not helpful. Instead of timeless style, the style this book promotes is arcane. It should be called ""A Guide to Being Snooty With Fashion (or, If You Have to Ask You Can't Afford It)"". Who lives this sort of lifestyle? Genevieve Antoine Dariaux's mentions such elegant icons as Jacqueline Kennedy and Audrey Hepburn, and then admonishes us to never wear costume jewelry, which both these ladies wore with great aplomb and absolute elegance. The best I can say for this book is that if you follow Ms. Dariaux's advice, you will probably be elegant. You will probably also be broke, exhaused, and looking as if you just emerged from a time warp."
4,Deliciously entertaining,"This book can be summarized in one sentence. Elegance is about good taste and discretion. That is it. Some of her rules can be taken with a pinch of salt (try telling a teenager she is not to wear black until she is 18!), but the general idea is powerful, simply because it is so rare to find a truly elegant woman these days. The taboos that I still believe work are - no diamonds (except wedding ring) during the day, no white shoes or bags- ever, diet alone, shop alone, and never act with affectation. Elegance is not expensive, it is more about cultivating a taste for a few superior things instead of a closet of cheapies. An interesting, fascinating read if you admire old school classic beauties."
4,"Old-fashioned, but still relevant","Ok, so realistically we are not going to chance clothes 4 times a day, and we DO have jobs to go to rather than just lunch! But overall, the solid advice still rings true!An interesting read if nothing else! Quaint would describe it well."
2,A Guide To Elegance,I do not think that anything in this book would make a woman elegant.! I knew everything that was in this book which disappointed me. I hoped to learn something which was the reason I purchased this book.
5,INCONTOURNABLE,"Best guide for girls.Genevieve Antoine Dariaux is so clever and funny.I am a fan and I am very happy to follow some of her advices.It's a very good present, always a hit !"
3,"Fantastic advice, but not always practical","I found much of the advise in this book very well thought out, including how to dress for one's shape in the easiest and simple way. However, for those of us on a limited dress budget, many of the clothing ideas are not very practical. I love some of her advice - such as not trying to cover up gray hair and keep one elegant and practical hairstyle as your own. This little books gets passed around to friends for some good advice and good laughs."
2,A bit dated...needs to be updated,"I enjoyed the ""what not to wear"" parts of the book. Although I found it to be incredibly dated. In order to be elegant she has you changing your clothes 5 to 6 times a day. Different outfits for 9,1,3,6,7,8 and 10 p.m. And stocking with seams...hmmmm Do they still sell these? There is some good advice but this book truly needs an update plus if you are not a city dweller spending weekends in the country a lot of this book will not be for you."
3,Weak on advice but quite entertaining,"While I was looking for advice that was more up to date and offered better examples, this book pointed me in the right direction on my quest for elegance and style. The book is short, sweet and amusing, but it fails to provide clear examples of what the author means. Left to my own imagination I conjured up rediculous images of what I thought the author was trying to describe as an elegant outfit. At one point, the author mentions a skirt suit worn with flat knee-high boots as an example of proper dress which caused a chuckle a return to the book store for more up to date advice."
4,Terribly Outdated and yet Adorable,"This book was written in the 60's and it's obvious once you begin to read through the chapters. It's been updated but it's still very archaic. The author says in no way can you wear heels with pants and yet it's all the rage in America as well as France. We've long gotten past the idea that you can't wear white past Labor Day, one of her beliefs, again quite dated, and that a woman's goal in life, despite working, is to capture a husband.It's an exquisite little book though, a pleasure to read and I love that the chapters are all in alphabetical order. I enjoyed reading this but I would have rather borrowed it from the library than own it. I would have given it three stars because it isn't updated well at all but it's such a delightful little read and has such a classic feel to it, her recommendations, that I didn't have the heart."
2,Useless except as outdated kitsch,"First, let me say in case it's relevant, that I hold true to many of Mme. Dariaux's maxims. I have a very small, selective wardrobe, tend to dress simply, wear neutrals, good materials, and what fine jewelry I own, and believe that it's necessary to dress appropriately to an occasion. However, this is advice that you'll find in virtually EVERY style book in existence (except perhaps the Lucky Style Manual, which I'd steer clear of.)That being said, any of the actual practical advice offered in this book is dated at best and offensive at worst. We're beyond the days when wearing black in the morning was gauche, when women wore gloves or veiled hats, or when women were expected to adjust their wardrobe to their partners' tastes. If you're badly in need of practical, untrendy advice, try Leah Feldon's books, or a book on French chic--following the dictates of this book will leave you frumpy and ridiculous."
3,"Fun read, but don't take her too seriously!","This is a really enjoyable, quick, read. It is fun to learn some new fashion rules, such as Alligator should not be worn after five. However, if I followed all of her advice my life would be quite boring. A lot of her advice is not too practical and quite pretentious. I do not care what she says, not every woman can have an Hermes bag(even if it does last ten years)! Also, an engagement ring under three carets is far from pitiful! Her book is a great piece for conversation, but not an elegance bible."
3,probably better for older ladies...,"Although this book does contain some good information, it seems to be aimed more towards the 30-50ish crowd. There are some excellent tips in the book, so I do not regret buying it. Most of the info is common sense, but just in case, if you are really clueless, pick up this book...however, if you want something geared towards 18-29ish women, I recommend finding ""How to Walk in High Heels"" by Camilla Morton instead."
2,Good tips if you can afford to take them.,"The author is extremely knowledgeable and has a grasp on elegance that is almost extinct nowadays. She actually knows chic. It is near impossible to follow her advice though. The book is really not adapted for modern women, let alone women with a limited budget.She lists items in the perfect wardrobe, and they seem pretty easy to attain. But then, for every occasion she describes throughout the book, she mentions another must-have. Usually what she describes are either impossible to find at one's convenient mall, or extremely expensive.She is very old-fashioned. I think if I followed all her advice I would resemble a snooty 60-year-old from France. I guess that's who she is."
1,NO WARRANTY,"I ordered a set of these. The description states ""FULLY GUARENTEED"". But when I recieved them ""NO WARRANTY"" is printed on each socket. Then I went to thier website. On the items description page it states the same""fully Guarenteed"" but then I went to the warranty page. Here's what it says:*Sunex Tools Impact Sockets, Wrenches, Screwdrivers, Specialty Tools, and VisesThese products carry a LIFETIME warranty--effective for as long as you own the product. Sunex International, Inc. will repair or replace at our option any part or unit which proves to be defective in material or workmanship. Adapters and extra thin wall impact sockets are not covered by this warranty.These are the extra thin wall design so thats why they have ""NO WARRANTY"" printed on them....Sunex is misrepresenting these by stating in its description ""fully guaranteed"" everywhere on the net. Total liars in my opinion. Buy another brand from an honest company."
1,Damaged Product,There were 2 pens ordered: a) 1 pen had a dry ink cartridge and b) the 2nd pen was cracked.
4,"Classy, Smooth Writing Instrument","I have the Phileas solid black in rollerball. A good-looking, classy pen with heft. Writes smoothly. First ink cartridge lasted over a year with significant note-taking use. Great alternative to the more expensive pens. A respectable instrument to pull out of a suit jacket or portfolio. A friend tipped me off to the value (price) when she pulled one out of her Coach case prior to a meeting. Wonderful addition to your executive style without the regret if lost.I'm buying two as gifts for executors of two significant contracts."
4,"Waterman acceptable, inexpensive alternative...","Bought this pen as a replacement for a well worn MontBlanc Generation rollerball that I recently lost. While this pen is not the same and clearly I would prefer the pen I had before, it is an acceptable alternative at a much lower price point. The weight of the pen is a bit low, and the case has almost no metal, but it writes well and gives me the continuity of line and definition that I like."
1,"Cheap, light, plasticy... AVOID","Not much to say. This pen feels cheap when held. It is light and the material is VERY ""plasticy."" Writes fine. The ""gold plated"" parts of the pen also seem cheap and gimmicky like the rest of the pen.Another note regarding the seller, the pen arrived with light abrasions and scratching on the cap. Clearly a used pen or the ""floor model."" Not happy, but not worth the hassle of tracking them down and hounding them for my $30.In sum, avoid this seller and avoid this pen."
4,A Window on the 16th Century - and History in General,"Marguerite de Navarre's Heptameron is a collection of seventy amusing stories which constitute a revealing ""window"" on the literate minority of the 16th century. Their principal focus is how men and women treat each other, not only then but perhaps always. The stories also provide other kinds of insights: e.g., the idea of predestined salvation or damnation was ""in the air"" intellectually before John Calvin's ""Institutes."" So it was formulated most effectively, but not originated, by Calvin. This fits a pattern of Western history: attributing developments to individuals, sort of a Most Valuable Player, individualistic version of history. For example, Gutenberg is said to have single-handedly ""invented"" moveable type, and Darwin to have discovered evolution, when these developments were hardly unique to them. As for Marguerite - or the storytellers for whom she is given credit of authorship - the stories are mainly fun."
5,The Heptameron,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. Its men vs women, lovers vs friends, making love vs rape. Everything you need to keep you wanting to read more"
3,Good,"The original Oasis version of Wonderwall is better, I would have liked if he included some of the live versions Ryan had done."
2,"Great album, but why is the re-mastering so poor?","Nothing to add on the quality of the songs, they are great, 5-Star. But since its release there was always the hope that one day a re-master would be created with Robert Quine's guitar as appropriatedly represented as on ""Blue Mask"". Instead, the ""re-master"" sounds almost identical to the original master, just generally louder, whith Quine's guitar hardly audible (rumours saying that in 82 Reed tuned it down after recording, since he could not stand Quine's guitar play being so clearly superior to his own...don't know if this is true but the sound is weak indeed). What a contrast to the recent fantastic re-master of ""Coney Island Baby"", where Reed himself apparently was in charge of the re-mastering. This seems not to be the case with this album, making it a disappointing experience."
4,rockin' Lou Reed on a roll,"From ""The Blue Mask"" through ""Legendary Hearts"" to ""New Sensations"" Lou Reed is clearly on a roll. ""Bottoming Out"", with its tight cinematic construction and carefully restrained imagery, is an absolutely brilliant lyric. Four stars, not five, because I usually listen to these songs only: ""Legendary Hearts"", ""Don't Talk to Me about Work"", ""Betrayed"", ""Bottoming Out"", and ""Home of the Brave"". By the bye, do you suppose Lou Reed knows really that ""Wherefore art thou Romeo?"" means ""Why are you Romeo?"", not ""Where are you, Romeo?""Also recommended: ""The Blue Mask"", ""New Sensations"", and ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"" by Jeff Burns."
4,good but not best of the Quine years,"This has some great songs, like One Last Shot, but Quine is mixed so far down he might as well not have been playing at all. (Supposedly Reed did this himself.) And for me, Quine's playing makes this the finest version of Reed's later bands. This was his last studio work with Reed. Buy the awesome Blue Mask instead."
3,Satisfactory for some children,This Stations of the Cross is intended for children. It uses the traditional stations and in the introduction describes briefly the indulgence related to the devotion. Each station consists of a single piece - a meditation/prayer in the first person in words appropriate to children. The glossy pictures accompanying each station are typical children religious art.
4,Savage Sam,My 10 year old son is reading Savage Sam..... he can not put the book down! I caught him in bed with the flashlight after the light were suppose to be out for bed-time. It has the same characters as Old Yeller and Sam is the offspring of Old Yeller...... Truely a great book.... an adventure for children....Little Arliss was captured by Indians in this book.
4,Savage Sam,"This is a really good book. If you like Old Yeller and other adventure/dog stories (Sounder, Jim Kjlgaard books like Stormy and Big Red, ect.) this is a book for you. It has all the excitingness of Old Yeller, and is (nearly) as good."
5,"Sequel to OLD YELLER; it's a great, lesser known novel","This lesser known sequel to OLD YELLER is a great coming-of-age novel for young people. I read it out loud to my fourth grade kids, and they were riveted. Yes, there was some era-appropriate violence, but nothing gratuitous. Highly recommended."
4,a race car of a coffee grindr,this thing works really great. i've enjoyed using it for a little over two years. the beans occasionally get jammed up in the hole leading to the clear plastic arena but this is easily remedies by a little fiddling with the tip of a knife. grinds the beans perfectly for my french press!
1,Zzzzzzzzz,"If you like staring at splash screens and listening to yourhard drive spin, you'll love this game. Once you actuallybreak through to the flying part, it's reasonably wellconstructed, although nothing like as revolutionary as thereviews would lead you to believe. But the mechanical parts,the set up, the campaign selection, the options -- arepure rubbish. And the amount of time it takes to load isjust flat amateurish. It's earned a proud place on my""little used"" file, and it's likely to stay there.Save your money."
1,Ubi soft not user friendly,"Bought it installed it ,no worky ,error msg ,replaced rts dll. as told still no worky. Tech support is just automated email response.I have heard this is common problem with a lot of there products ,I know the Pacifc Fighter starts out with a error msg. And no I never had both products installed at same time.Cheap stuff stay away."
4,"Get ""Gun""","I have watched the video of ""My New Gun"" three times, and each time I have discovered more interesting, telling details. The plot doesn't drive the film; instead, it seems to evolve almost by happenstance from the characters themselves. Although there is no ""crack-me-up"" humor at all, if you think about what is going on as it happens, this movie is hilarious. Diane Lane, James LeGros, and Stephen Collins all shine."
4,Great acting by Hollywood's most underated actress...,"I saw this movie without really knowing what it was about and was completely suprised by how good it is. Diane Lane, who is not only beautiful, but talented, plays a yuppie housewife who is given a gun by her husband. After she gets her neighbor involved, James Legros, they embark on series of strange, and mysterious events. This movie won best picture at the Sundance film festival in 1992, and is worth renting, but don't buy unless it's under $20. Diane Lane is truly underated in Hollywood and ""My New Gun"" proves why."
1,Disappointment,"The whole movie was a huge disappointment and was nowhere related to any kind of comedy,it is based on a very starnge relation between Diana Lane and a weird neighbor who she permit to have access to every detail of her life though she is supposed to be having a happy merriage..in general, a disappointing performance by Lane, and a very boring movie's scenario."
5,Excellent book for its purpose which is...,"...to provide an INTRODUCTION to the multiple debates spawned by the introduction of Darwinian theory...it is clear, concise, and interesting...more to the point it provides excellent references to allow readers to further pursue those debates and controversies which they find most interesting."
5,best blush ever,"but they always break up totally. my last 3 did,must be old. i still use it even all crumbled in container,"
2,too biased,"I was hoping to learn more about garbage and waste disposal by reading this book, but I was disappointed by the author's clear environmental agenda. According to the author, all garbage is bad and there is no such thing as responsible waste disposal although there is not a lot of data provided to back this up. I could have also done without the various laudatary quotes from Marx and Engels in the book. Dispite the opinionated writing, there is some interesting historical perspective on the topic of garbage."
4,Adept Guide,"There is little backward on the angles or truths in this book, as any traveller of this rich country ought to know its history, their own history, and if he is an American, the history of America's political impact on Nicaragua."
5,"a brilliant novel - fresh, in-your-face, lively and fun","""Under the Frog"" does what most novelists aspire to - it tells a rollicking story, brings history, place and character to life, and creates it's own unique story-telling style with fresh, slangy prose that makes a heavy subject funny to read."
3,The Laws of Attraction,Good reading. I love how Sherryl Woods follows thru on her series. I like reading about the same people and how their lives inter-twine.I just wish she would put a number on the series so I can read them in order.
4,Great book!,As usual Sherryl Woods provides an entertaining and enjoyable story. Would recommend this to anyone interested in an easy read.
2,glue issues,"They are nice and bright but the glue that holds the folds together is sparse and/or defective. I have to add tape, stickers or more glue to keep the envelope's contents from coming out."
4,Get your special mailing noticed,"I use these when I need to have no doubt this mail will stick out from the crowd of other mail. I can tell the client ""look for the bright pink envelope"" or something like that. I can also spot it in my incoming mail when I get a pile of junk I sometimes wait to open. I got a good price here too, much better than the local store. What's with the price of envelopes at the store anyway? You'd think they're processed with gold or something."
2,Won't stay in tune,"Ok it is cheap so what did I expect. I was buying something fun, a toy of sorts. But the headphone jack gives no audio. You would think that would work. The violin works ok with a small amp I got. But try as we might it will not stay in tune. Plastic tuning pegs in a plastic body is not a design that is going to work when friction is needed. But then why are all violins made with such a crappy tuning system is beyond me. But then I am not stuck in the 16th century on design. I am certainly not a traditionalist. Given how cheap this is we will probably make our own personal changes to it in the shop and have fun doing so. Fun factor high. Quality low."
1,Deceptive Seller - Stay Away For Your Sanity,"I have received the Barcelona Student 1/2 size violin I purchased from Austin Bazaar. I have tried to contact Austin Bazaar on the phone twice and left 2 messages. They didn't contact me back. I emailed Austin Bazaar and they replied with 3 links of their policy OF 30 DAY RETURN IF THE ITEM IS DEFECTIVE AND SETUP INSTRUCTIONS. I followed the 3 links they sent me to setup the violin AGAIN and had no sound. I tuned the strings with the Korg Chromatic Tuner TM-40 I bought from Amazon and matched the tunes of G, D, A & E. But, it doesn't have any sound when I pulled the bows. It came with 2 bows and both don't work. Austin Bazaar ignored my voice messages and emails by refusing to call me back and reply back with the Return Authorization Number. BUYERS, BEWARE OF THIS SHADY SELLER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Dont do it,Violin is heavy and hard to play because of shape. If you are a beginner this could give you shoulder and neck problems. The sad thing is that this violin has a good sound. The shape looks nice but is silly and not at all practical for playing.
5,Another great playmobil product,"Purchased this for my 4 yr old daughter last year. Lots of little detailed accessories that, in my opinion, draw a lot of kids to the playmobil line. Excellent quality product. Kitchen is stocked with everything from tableware to food to a maid whose tiny shoes come on and off. My daughter is not a ""princess"" type girl but got the castle as a gift and once the kitchen was added she loved it. I will get her another room this year, and one the next gift giving holiday (birthday). The kitchen is a great place to start if you are doing the castle piece-meal."
4,Everyday Basics Self-adjusting soft-cup bra,"A comfortable bra. It is especially hard to find bras with front adjustable, non stretch straps. Not very sexy but very fuctionable!Thank you!"
3,Didn't self adjust for me.,Don't understand why it is called a self-adjusting soft cup. It fit quite poorly and never adjusted to anything. Back it went.
5,Nice bras!,"These are very nice, and the price is right for them. Much better price than the big box stores. Same product."
2,Strangely put together,"While I found a lot of the material in the book very interesting, it is put together in such a muddled way that it is very difficult enjoy reading it. The book seems to be composed of a number of previously written (and in many cases overlapping) articles joined together with fairly boring 'filler' to try and present a 'complete' view.I would suggest buying the book if you're interested in reading about early colonial life in the vanilla industry in Papantla, Mexico. Most of the other information can be easily found on the internet."
2,"informative, but painful to read","Though this seems to be an extensively researched book on a thoroughly fascinating subject, the author's language is so awkward, inconsistent in tone and fraught with error that Vanilla is frustrating to read.Ironically, the author Patricia Rain states in her acknowledgements that her editors' English ""is impeccable."" I find it hard to believe that the text was even proofread.Consider the following sentence, typical of the language in the book:""Families pollinate with the stem off a leaf of the tutor tree, toothpicks, twigs, or long thumbnails.""It requires multiple passes from the reader before one realizes that there is a spelling error.I consistently find myself deciding if I want to decipher what Rain is trying to say and continue with the abundant information she has gathered, or to give up and wait for another, better edition."
2,Everything Anyone Would Ever Want To Know...And Then Some!,"I read this book as it was a suggestion from my book group. I adore vanilla. Most likely more than the average person. However, the author of this book REALLY REALLY REALLY loves vanilla. More than I think it humanly possible. Patricia Rain's pacing is terrible, she opens the book with a list of incorrect facts in an effort to ""trick"" the reader and then show off her smarts. I think the person who would buy this book already knows such basics as ""vanilla beans are green, not brown when they are growing"" so her trickery just comes off odd. If you really want a book that is badly written, but tells you everything you could possibly ever need or want to know about vanilla, then this is the book for you! If you're looking for an interesting read about the cultural history of a spice, I'd skip this one."
5,Great!,"These envelopes were very bright! I loved them. The paper used is very nice and the inside of the envelopes is the same color as the outside, a nice surprise from only outside dyed paper."
5,Great looking shoes!,I bought these shoes in pewter and bronze. I absolutely love them! They are so sexy and can be worn dressed up or down.
1,Tasted Like Plastic,We ordered the twenty pack and split it with another household. No one could eat them. They tasted like plastic. We tried several from a few different packages and had the same results.
3,Classic Greek mythology... and the really wierd,"""Princess of Troy"" with Gordon Scott is set in classical Greece and is definitely the better of the two films. Contrary to the impression of the title the story actually is a reworking of the Perseus-Cassiopeia story with a scheming king thrown in. While intended as a pilot of a children's TV series the acting is reasonable though the special effects leave much to be desired (especially the monster).By contrast ""Against the Mongols"" with Mark Forrest is just plain weird. Hercules works best when kept to his Greek roots and this film goes about as far away from those as is possible. The plot of Hercules facing off against the three sons of Genghis Khan is not helped by the acting, the make up for the Mongols, the occasional soldier dressed in pseudo-Crusader armor, or there is not much action actually involving Hercules, and way too many scenes of the Mongols raiding helpless villages and the brother arguing among themselves."
3,alright,Case and vinyl in great condition. Only wish htI would have been.informed someone's name.was written.on.front of case in big permanent marker
1,Beware,"I LOVE this album, however....... this is colored vinyl, not mentioned, warped, and the center hole was off center. Very disappointed."
5,The Numinous Arrives In Shaggy Garb,"No other work of the late 60's better epitomizes the totally fearless pursuit of new musical and lyrical pathways than ABAB. As a young rock guitarist I remember trying to parse the band's artistic intent, in crafting an album of such broad scope. I gave up after 10 or 12 listens, and just celebrated the crazy genius of it. This work is a voyage. Ulysses does the Haight. And while many other great albums by numerous artists (including the Airplane) would follow in the succeeding years before bean counters took over the industry entirely, I am unable to identify a single one that combines such ferocious focus and chaos in a single work. 'Wheels of Fire' comes close, perhaps. ""Exile on Main St."", possibly, or Moby Grape #1. Over 40 years later, I'm still mesmerized by the sheer audacity... Melting Bear remembers."
3,Is it a good job of remastering?,"Please tell me they've re-mixed this album. I only have the original LP. There are great songs on here, ruined by tinny, poorly-mixed recording. ""Young Girl Sunday Blues"" is a great Marty Balin song, but the vocals are buried, and ""Last Wall of the Castle"" sounds as though it were recorded on a walkman. Flesh out the bass, bring the vocals forward, and this will emerge as the second-greatest Airplane album, after ""Pillow."""
3,A biography with a unique perspective.,"Fodder for those ""upset"" with the man, focusing more on ""G"" than his teachings. Since G was not inclined to use money for selfish purposes, his means of aquisition must be tempered with this knowledge. The debate may rage forever regarding the notion of whether or not the ends justify the means. Taylor has done a good job bringing us into some of the personal aspects of a man he thought of as a great and profound teacher.A subjective glance at a man without much focus on the teaching, this is a good book for those more interested in gossip than spiritual growth. For those of us on the sidelines and in posession of ignorance, being critical is a simple matter which Taylor proves post haste. He does, however, lend some discussion to the way in which he clearly benefitted from being in the presence of the greatest teacher of the 20th century."
3,Portrait of a Con Artist,"Anyone interested in the psychology of religious fanaticism will find this book instructive, both through the author's nondeserved reverential attitude toward Gurdjieff, as well as the disgusting truths he reveals about this ""great teacher."" Taylor thus displays his own hypnosis by not even recognizing much of Gurdjieff's behavior (e.g. impregnating women & leaving them in the lurch) as atrocious."
1,The Big Man & His Shadow,Account of how the fearless leader hoodwinks yet another pidgeon. Too bad Toomer & the rest of them couldn't honor & respect those who truly deserved it...their wives & mothers.
5,Her Mother's Sins,"This is a very good read, its awful though what some parents put their children through. I myself was subjected to physical and mental abuse when I was growing up it has affected my adult hood in quite a big way so can see myself in some of the chapters. I hate the thought of what a lot of children are subjected too, its hard to believe that this abuse is still happening today. I always purchase my books at amazon.com for easy reading of the books via my Kindle which I also purchased from Amazon. Very prompt service from them too. They are my favourite company and don't download from any other source."
1,This book is about boycotting Disney.,"If you are looking for a book to helping you get the most from your experiences with the Disney company like I was, this book is not for you. The book was written by members of the religious right and is all about boycotting Disney. Don't waste your time with it."
1,Boycotting 101 for Bigots,"The potential contribution of this little volume cannot be overestimated: Imagine the joy of visiting a Disney theme park unspoiled by the repugnant bigotry that drives Land and York's calls for boycotting Disney. If they are successful in convincing fellow bigots to avoid Disney, then the rest of us will surely have added reason to take our children to ""The Happiest Place on Earth."" Thanks, Dick and Frank!"
1,Interesting opinion but poorly written,"With much interest in studying Disney, I appreciate the author's different opinion towards the Disney company. But as a book itself, the author seems to have put up a lot of irrelevant stuff into it, such as where did the word ""boycott"" in English come from, and what does the Bible say about the act of boycotting, which all seems unrelated to the Disney's issue. The author should have gone deeper into the issue, such as to provide more evidence and analysis to support his argument. But the author has not done that. As a whole, I will instead recommend you only to read the first chapter of the book!"
3,"strangely interesting, heavy","this bracelet was quite interesting, but the bracelet was very heavy on the wrist. The charms were a bit boring. However, for the money it is good value I suppose. The bracelet was slightly uneven in colour too. Perhaps go for the silver version"
4,raw but good,"this ep is only worth 4 stars because it only has 2 new tunes on it, they are as good as those off the karelian isthmus although the recording is not as good. there is also a new vocalist on vulgar necrolatry-jukka kolehmainen apparntly from abhorrence, although i dont know if this is the same band from brazil who recently released their debut.anyway, there are some good songs here and its rawness makes them a little heavier than their later versions, the cover is excellent and so are the songs, however i would only recommend getting this if you liked the karelian isthmus and want more"
1,Missing episodes!!!!,"Wow - hugely disappointing. We bought this for our parents specifically because the Chicago episode occurs in Season Two - they opened the package on Christmas day to find that this episode is not included in the set!!!This should NOT be sold as a complete season - it is in fact missing two episodes that ran during this season (Chicago and Katrina). It appears as though this was a HIstory Channel mistake, not this seller specifically (History Channel's ""Compete Set"" isn't complete either. But still - people need to know that they are not actually buying all of the episodes.VERY upsetting - what a waste,"
4,"Facinating, but too much hype","Interesting video with stunning visuals; great for high school classroom use. However, they buy into and perpetuate the 2012 hype, ignoring the beliefs of most experts on the Mayans and even Mayan elders themselves. Aside from this departure from true history, it is an excellent series."
3,Not all I thought it would be,"I loved Stormy Weather very much and had high hopes for this book. My complaint is that it is very long winded, and the plot doesn't make sense. I can only read so many descriptions of the landscape and weather. I didn't understand why the kids left the house to begin with and alas, the last 3/4 of the book is them trying to get home again. Throw in the infinitesimal chances Adair just happened to stop and stay at the house where her horse was taken. The killing of Dolly really upset me and was not necessary to the plot. I was disappointed. I would still strongly recommend Stormy Weather though."
1,It's a struggle from beginning to end,"At first I thought the historical information in the beginning of each chapter reflected some importance to the chapter itself, it didn't take me long to figure out otherwise. I skipped them for most of the book. I didn't like the characters - the love story was unbelievable. The hardships the main character encounters along her LONG journey home are just too overhelming to believe. I kept reading thinking at some point SOMETHING is bound to happen that's interesting. I was deeply disappointed - a BIG waste of my time and TREES..."
5,This Novel's Grit Glitters and Gleams,"I am no fan of historical novels, and I do not voluntarily pick up books on the Civil War, but this book is exceptional, brilliant, really, from its subject--one never explored, completely unknown to most of us--to its lyrical, lively style. I would call this an important novel, portraying aspects of this war we didn't know, and giving us an unusual female character with admirable spunk and guts. Jiles' research seems impeccable, and provides an underpinning to this book that makes its tension just that much more gripping. And that this author is also a fine poet is clear--the prose flows like water in rivers so clear and swift we realize we've forgotten how beautiful, how muscular they can be. A marvelous book, garnering well-deserved attention!"
3,feels like a personal substory of the Civil War,"If you are interested in history, this will put you in the period. It does get tedious at the end—too many problems to surmount before arriving at the end of the story."
1,Terrible,"Reads like an actual history book, it barely has any plot and the ending leaves you with almost no answers. Just terrible."
3,Compelling (3 1/2 stars)...,"I didn't love this book, but the beautiful and subtle writing compelled me to turn the pages. The story of Adair Colley has a slow start. She is a young Missouri woman who is taken prisoner during the Civil War. While in prison, she is interrogated by Major William Neumann. Despite their differences, they fall in love. (There is no way to describe it without making it sound like some trite romance novel, is there?) They are separated and she travels the long journey home -- hoping to find her father, her sisters, her horse, her home, her life. Needless to say, it is a difficult journey. This novel is banal and contrived at times, but the writing is rather poetic and it does vividly portray the horror of the Civil War. I'm a sucker for historical novels, and the Civil War has always intrigued me. All in all, the story, despite its predictability, is compelling enough to read."
3,Great start...boring middle....allusive ending,"I heard a lot of great things about this book although it looked like a historical romance. The first third of the book was great, even the romanc part. The writing is lyrical and beautiful also. After Adair is released from prison is where problems started. Maybe I thought she was going somewhere but the last half of the book is her wandering around Missouri. The ending was nothing that I hoped it would be and left a lot of loose ends. Overall is was an ok book, I would check it out from the library though before buying it."
2,Interesting premise but very unsatisfying read,"I must have read a different book than the other reviewers. While the book is filled with interesting facts (perhaps too many), I was disappointed by the lack of plot and character development. I found the storyline to be very disjointed. There are scores of superfluous minor characters who show up briefly and then disappear. And, when minor characters do reappear (like her sisters via correspondence), I just didn't care. It was as if the author were trying to cram too many vignettes and too many characters into this first novel. More often than not, I wondered why the characters were there at all. Even the main characters were relatively unsympathetic. The book didn't come together for me at all. I found it a very unsatisfying read."
3,"Learned some history, but the story line was bland","I read this as a member of a book club and probably would not have finished it but for that reason. I found the historical excerpts at the beginning of each chapter interesting, but they seldom related to the storyline. The lack of quotation marks was maddening - was she just thinking that or did she really say it?!? The descriptions of the wildlife and natural setttings were very poetic, but the character development seemed lacking. I enjoyed Cold Mountain more than this book."
3,Softball Rox @ LSMS,"Enemy Women is one of those books that I wouldn't have just picked off the shelf and read, but I had to read it for school, so I did. There are a few things that didn't go with me in this book: 1.) there were no quotation marks , so I often had to reread a passage to understand what was happening, 2.) the story can often be slow and have long, boring passages between the interesting ones, mainly at the beginning, and 3.) I wasn't so big on the ambiguous ending. You don't really know what happens at the end! All in all, though, it was a book I reasonably enjoyed once I got to about chapter 10 or so. Then it began to get interesting. Even though it's not the greatest book ever, it's still something I recommend reading if you ever have spare time."
3,Slow but it picks up,I am interested in the Civil War period so thought I would take a chance and buy this book. It took me several chapters before I could really get into it. Once past the slow chapters (1/3 through the book) it did keep my attention. The lack of quotation marks make it difficult to read. I wouldn't recommend reading it for the history. It is more of a love story although some history is thrown in. It just wasn't a book that I would recommend to my friends.
1,Texas Librarian,"I have a 30 minute commute to and from work so I listen to many books on tape. The readers of audio books make all the difference in the world as to how a listener responds, and this reader definitely could use some more lessons on reading audio books. I found her reading to be boring and tedious, with too little expression or variation in voice or tone. I have trudged through 4 of the tapes and will not finish the audio book."
2,Insomniac Special,"About three-fourths of the way through Enemy Women, the heroine Adair tells trivial, tedious stories to Lisa and Rosalie, who have taken her into their home. Adair wants them to fall asleep so she can decamp with Whiskey, her horse who was stolen and is now in the possession of these two women. This episode could serve as a metaphor for the entire novel, most of which is intolerably boring. The author tries to keep us awake with the clever literary device of dispensing with quotation marks, perhaps in hopes we will remain alert so as to identify what is dialogue and what isn't. But cheap tricks with punctuation are no substitute for a good tale well told. It does appear the author has done some admirable historical research for Enemy Women, though I must take that on faith. All in all, I wish I had used my time to re-read Gone With the Wind."
2,disappointing,"What did I miss? The stellar reviews surprised me as I found the book to be tedious and without a spark of realism, (except for the historical abstracts which were the best part of the book and for which I gave the book 2 stars instead of the 1 star the fictional part deserved). Too many coincidences, two dimensional characters, disagreeable Adair, delusional major (what does he see in the mercurial Adair?) and dull dialogue disappointed me. It all adds up to a big D if I were grading it in school. The subject,Southern women's fate in the war zone during the Civil War, is a good one. Too bad the execution does not live up to its promise. The author does merit my thanks for including the historical notes which I shall re-read instead of finishing the book."
3,"Historically interesting, but otherwise unbelievable","Historically, I found this book to be very interesting and educational. I had no idea about the imprisonment of women during the Civil War. Totally Fascinating! But as far as the rest of the story goes, none of it is believable. I want to say that things worked out too well for the main character, but obviously she was imprisoned and had other hardships so 'well' probably isn't the correct word. I guess I just don't believe that someone can experience that number of coincidences and lucky turns. When one day she found her stollen horse after all the traveling and time that had past I almost put the book down. Probably the most unbelievable part of the book was the romance. Even factoring in that wartime is different that other times does not make that storyline any more believable. As stated earlier, I really liked the historical lesson I received reading this book. The rest of it is was just OK."
2,Early details spoilt the novel,"On the night that Adair Colley receives Whiskey (a horse) from her father, the novel states that Savannah is nearly 15 years of age. This is supposed to be the year before the Civil War begins, the winter of 1860-61. This should make Savannah about 19 four years later when the action of Enemy Women takes place, and about 1 year older than Adair. I was irritated that this inconsistency was not picked up; Adair is constantly seen to be protecting her 'little sisters' when they are not really little at all. The style of the book was also confusing, with no speech marks and chapter prefaces that did not relate to the chapters concerned."
3,Captivating Story...,"This book had me hooked by the first few lines and did not disappoint me at all. Though, I have to agree with another reader that the lack of quotation marks did make reading it a little less enjoyable. I hope the author uses them if she is to write another book. The other problem I had was that I did not know if I liked Adair. I found myself sometimes pulling for her and other times hoping she would get caught. I really did like the letters that preceeded each chapter. Nice touch Ms. Jiles!"
3,Interesting Perspective,"I hadn't really thought about how women faired during the Civil war until I read this book. It was a different perspective to see it from. However, although I liked the main character, the author's style of writing threw me off. I found the lack of quotations and exclamations made the character's dialogue seem flat and it was difficult to determine the tone. I suppose this was supposed to be artistic, but I personally didn't like the style."
1,I didn't even finish it!,"I really didn't like this book. I read the first 100 pages, and stopped. I found it very hard to understand what was going on a certain points (and I am an avid reader), however, that may have been due to the fact that I had a hard time concentrating! It was a very boring, dry read, and my mind did keep wandering on to other things...The story was told in a strange sort of way...I can't quite describe what it was with the book, but I had to stop reading.I guess my recommendation would be that if you are looking for a fast paced, exciting book, with character development, this is not it."
2,A good story with a big style flaw,"This was an interesting novel because it illustrated how gritty and personal the American Civil War was in Missouri. The story was good enough to keep me engaged and I cared about the characters.Good is not up to the level of `Great', however. I have to give my rating a one star penalty because, for whatever reason, the author does not use quotes to distinguish dialog from other prose. This was a pretentious distraction that really chopped up the flow of my reading of the novel. It was useless and damaging. I'm surprised the novel's editors let it go."
1,PAINFULL!!!!!!!,This book was so slow and DULL! I got about three chapters into it before putting it down for good. The lack of quotation when someone is speaking is very distracting and hard to follow. I found myself going back to read paragraphs over and over again just to understand what was being described and what was actually being spoken. I am mystified how this could be given five stars by anyone. Don't waste your time or money on this one!!
5,Railroads of Nevada volume 1-2-3,"The 3 volume books on this subject hits the nail on the head great author great facts but needs mote photos of the different locomotives and cars that were on these railroads. David Myrick, in my opinion, has written some of the greatest books of railroads of different states. As I own them all.this set is made up of three volumes, and each volume is almost 400 pages. So I can see why we don't have all three volumes into one as it would probably be 1500 pages."
5,An Easy Read & Good Orientation to the Topic,This book or one similar should be a required first reading for those interested in more than keeping quality records. It orients the reader to the true driving force behind quality movements--burning desire for customer satisfaction. Have a copy or two in your facility library and make sure your new employees read at least the first 4-5 chapters.
4,A further description of the Deming Management Method,"Dr. Deming called Dobyns and Crawford-Mason ""the broadcasters and clarifiers of [his] message for a larger audience."" Their book and PBS series Quality or Else introduced the general public to the Deming Management Method."
5,Terry Orlick CD,I recommend all Terry Orlick products for any serious athlete who wants to improve their performance.
4,Challenging and surprising!,I emphatically love this cd! His long respected skills as a musician and songwriter are evident as the instrumentaion proves to be clever and complex. The chord progressions and lyrics keep you guessing as to what is coming next and the music is ripe with wonderful dissonance and synthesized effects. Navarro takes the mundane out of modern rock. He is able to satiate the knowledgeable music fan as few artists can. I hope this effort is not his last.
5,Absolute surprise,I saw This Guy On mtv and for the first Time Those Fvckers We're showing videos. anyway this is guy Fvcking awesome he can sing guitar and some other things.. buy it dEwds..
2,A Bit Dissapointing,"I got this CD after hearing Rexall on the radio. Unfortuantley, the entire CD was the same. It gave me a headache, and to tell you the truth, it was not worth 15. Jane's Addiction is excellent, so if you like them, don't expect the same from this album. It's okay for a solo record, but it's not the best i've heard."
5,The Best...,"I love this album... it's the best.. I do not even skip 1 song on it.. and there is only one other artist(s) that I don't have to do that with either... I really truly love this cd.. Dave has such a beautiful voice, and is truly talented.. I can't wait till he starts doing a solo tour..."
4,Trust No One Who Says This Is A Bad Album,"Dave Navarro's first solo album, ""Trust No One"", is an impressive first solo effort. Trust no one who says this is a bad album- because they are wrong. The only weak track on this album is ""Everything"". The rest of the tracks are great, and they all show Navarro's talents as a guitarist, bassist, singer, and songwriter. Navarro is also pretty good at playing a synthesizer. Favorite tracks include: ""Rexall"", ""Mourning Son"", (a song Navarro wrote about his mother, who was murdered), ""Avoiding the Angel"", and ""Slow Motion Sickness"". All fans of Dave Navarro or Jane's Addiction should check this album out."
2,Lackluster,"The only real reason I even bought this album instead of downloading is because it was, suprisingly, in the bargin bin at K-Mart. I figured ""Heck, Dave's work was truely amazing with Jane's and The Red Hot's, so for 9.99 I'll give anyone with such creditals a spin."" Plus, the single ""Rexall"" is getting major airplay as well as being very good.Unfortunately, ""Rexall"" highlights the CD in it's entirity (Which is only a very modest ten tracks long). While no songs were particularly bad (with the exception of the horrifying ""Everything""), i was dismayed it took Dave so long to write ten lackluster songs.Unless your an absolute Dave Fan, i recommend just getting the Rexall single"
2,The rats fled this sinking ship a LONG time ago!,"Bought this CD forever and a day ago (at an Ames closeout, for $1, nonetheless). It was a while before I finally put it into my CD player. When I did, I was stunned. And not in a good way, either. Around Not for Nothing, I turned it off.The only true saving graces on this CD are the two singles, Rexall and Hungry. Both are truly great songs, with really cool videos (and who, among all us girls, could resist a shirtless Navarro? He's as yummy as they come!). Unfortunately, the coolness of the first two songs doesn't lend to the rest of the CD.It also doesn't help that, prior to the reunion of the year, Navarro was doing guest guitar with Christina Aguilera (I can forgive the P. Diddy thing, because I actually liked that). We can only hope for good things out of the Jane's Addiction reunion :)"
2,A great listen if your impacted by western civilization,"When I popped this in the CD player, first thought that came to my mind was ""crockpot"" ripoff. After further listens, I began to see the influence of Dave's to be wife (Carmen Electra). Her stamp is all over this album. She is credited for vocals and bass on tracks 2,6,& 7. Navarro reminds me a lot of ""flux capacitor"" and post era Dave Grohl. Sequencing on track 8 is rough. All in all if you like ""chief wiggum"", go buy it!"
3,Good solo effort,"I think it's a good first solo effort from Dave Navarro. All the songs on the album are good. I think that the guy has a lot of potential. So, if you're a fan of Jane's addiction and Red Hot Chili Peppers, I think you should buy the album, you won't be disappointed."
1,Cheeseball,"Dumb album cover, dumb songs, dumb lyrics, alterna-spank power monkey. All songs sound the same. What happened? De-pierceify the nipple-ization, Dave, por favor. I guess, that, uh, yeah...this album was produced very well, and showcases some modern stuff. Very modern. Kind of like a nice glass of warm milk, or hitting yourself in the head with a hammer, or both. Buy this album if you like wheat toast without butter, or those button up shirts without collars. Nehru collars, that's it. Some call them band collars."
4,"Great music, lyics need some work","Surprisingly like nothing he has done with his two former groups Janes Addiction, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This disk shows a much darker side of Dave Navarro. Few guitar solos, and a lot of high tech sounds. Part of this record sounds like Nine Inch Nails. Good diveristy throughout the record. Dave is not the greatest lyricist, but he sings very sincerely. The album is more commercial then I expected, and I wouldn't be surprised if a songs on the record got some air play. A good record to add to your collection."
5,incredibly good.,"This CD is absolutely great, its definetly different from what Navarro does in janes and the chilli peppers, but thats fine. This CD focuses on his singing/lyrics. Each track is done with care, and tho many people think they sound the same, i think each one has its own unique sound. If you compare Mourning Son, and Not for nothing you'll really understand waht i mean. Not for nothing is very fast paced and reminds me of a nine inch nails remix. Mourning son on the other hand is very calm, and the way all hte sounds are layered together is just astounding. This CD is really worth your time, and if you are a navarro fan, give this one a chance. Don't expect those blazing solos and new funky guitar riffs, instead expect something thats more vocal, and something that is very very musical."
3,Not What I Expected,"I was prepared to love this cd. I got it the day after it came out and couldn't wait to hear it. When I did I was pretty disappointed. Dave is one of my favorite guitarists. His work with Jane's Addiction and the cd he did with the Red Hot Chili Peppers was really good so I was hoping there was going to be a lot of emphasis on the guitar work. There's not. Also, he isn't exactly the greatest song writer, although I could have overlooked that if he would have done more with the guitar. I still think he's very talented, though, and the cd isn't bad at all compared to a lot of the rock cd's that have come out recently. I hope he works on the parts of this cd that failed and release another one that will truly showcase his talents."
2,I expected something different,"What happened to Spread? I would rather hear something more 'instrumental' coming from one of my favorite all-time guitarists. Yes, there is great guitar work here, but not enough! I heard more creative and inspired music on the Deconstruction album. I can do without the lyrics and vocals -it's just not what I know Dave Navarro for. I guess it's more of a vocal album? Maybe that's what he wanted? It's better than I can do (at the moment), but it's just kinda mainstream and not what I would ever expect, or what I'm into."
4,Dave can sing as well not just playing his guitar!!!!,"It's a good try for Dave, this debut album shows that Dave can also sing. However his guitar skill cannot show in this album. The album should add more variety on it. The opening of this album is an attractive, catchy song *REXALL* with a powerful distortion in the chorus.Although I'm not a fan of Jane's adiction or red hot chili pepper, I feel that Dave is a talented guitarist+singer, I hope he can achieve in this album.Try listening to the first few songs in this album, some of them are really good!!!"
5,satisfecha,"buenas tardes, el producto resulto ser de excelente calidad quede extremamente satisfecha con la chaqueta, mejor de lo que esperaba. Gracias"
3,Cute but has small parts.,I LOVE the Simpsons and while the movie was just okay I thought this was very cute.I got it for a friend that has small children but it could not be used as the parts are small.The item has very good detail. Much better than what I expected to be honest with you. But...............It is more suited for a person that is a collector but then do you or anyone else need to collect plastic?Okay quality but not designed for play.
2,You money is best spend elsewhere...,"If you're looking for a nostalgic review of the 80s, this is your video. If you'd rather have something more up-to-date, this is not the video for you. Released in 2007, but looks as if it was made 20 years earlier. Even the video quality is worse than low-res YOUTUBE. Nothing here you won't learn online for free. Take my advice and avoid this unless you just really have money to blow with no value expected in return."
2,Poorly assembled notepads,"While the paper quality is reasonable for recycled material (it has the consistency of newsprint), the pages are not properly perforated. It is impossible to cleanly remove sheets from these pads without tearing your notes. Unless you intend to leave the pages bound together, find another pad."
3,Not the best product out there,"The product serves it purpose. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the quality is real flimsy. The backing is really weak. The paper pads had random creasing which at times looked like someone took a razor blade to the them and sliced them across the page which could not have been the case because when they arrived they were wrapped in plastic. Anyhow, like I said, the pads serve its purpose, but if you are looking for quality, this is not the product for you."
4,A bizarre ride,"This movie doesn't really resemble Re-Animator, more like a Nightmare on Elm St. meets Phantasm and Hellraiser...but it has lots of strange stuff in it, plus tons of inventive gore and slime. I would have liked to see what the ""beyond"" world looked like (like in Phantasm), but otherwise this is a pretty cool flick, with strange monsters, plus Barbara Crampton is so hot in this one. Jeffrey Comb's character is the biggest freak in movie history. I originally saw this on Monster Vision, and was intrigued by it then, still a fun trip. Check it out."
3,"More gore than sense, but entertaining if you can stand the camp.","Fan's of exloding heads and melting dogs rejoice! From Beyond takes graphic bodily transformations to a level that even J. Carpenter must envy. People burst out of other people, heads are twisted off, eye stalks force their way through foreheads, and floppy elongated fingers grope attractive young women!The story is nonsense, the characters are ridiculous, their motivations totally unbelievable, but this is still a must see film for fans of classic horror.If you don't mind the terrible acting and (by today's standards) silly FX, then there might be room on your DVD rack for this gore filled triumph of campy horror. On the other hand, if you're into scary movies that take themselves more seriously (6th sense, Saw etc.) then you'll be using this one as a coaster after the first viewing."
4,from beyond,"this is a good movie.i'm partial to jeffrey combs horror movies,but just because he happens to be in a particular movie does not mean its going to be a winner.hit and miss...that's what show biz is all about.this is a hit.it has all of the necessary ingredients for a sucessful combs' movie:weird special effects and combs doing that 'thing' he does with his characters.so,all you combs fans who've been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd,here it is...buy!you won't be disappointed."
5,"""Pathways to the ......Gods?""","A thoroughly nasty piece of work by filmmaker Stuart Gordon based on the H.P. Lovecraft tale of horror involving a young man's wish to open doorways to the unknown .........[there's this machine you see].The effects are quite [literally], scalp-lifting......now just what is that growing out of junior's head? The pituitary gland episode.........and then there are those beings. We enter pre-Clive Barker teritory with this unhearalded, and WAY ahead of its time concept movie.JEFFREY COMBS - very underrated, deserves more !This one forms part of a ""Trilogy"" - ""Re-Animator"", ""Bride of Re-Animator"" and ""From Beyond"" - elegant and stylist - very worthy of DVD reslease, and a must for any serious horror fan!"
3,Virtual gate to another world of the fourth eye.,This movie has some gore that is opened by a switch to another world. Once switch in our brain has a fourth eye and I say no more. Watch this film and be surprised be virtual illusions which is only seen when machine is turned on.Get ready for a beast that changes and never lets go to the final chapter of the movie.
2,B-Movie B-Ware,"The reviews here are skewed wayy positive by many viewers who are age-old fans rejoicing over a long delayed DVD release. Yes the uncut version must be a whole lot better than what has gone before and the video quality throughout is great. I can only imagine the travesty of a cut version, the restored bits all fit in quite well.But keep in mind, this is B-Movie material and although I really really like B-Movies, this one did not make it to my ""keeper"" pile and I'm pretty lax about that, most movies I get are keepers. So if you're a fan, buy the DVD, but if you're new to this director or looking to expand your horror collection I recommend to skip this one."
2,Good for the 80's - but not really kitchy . . .,I would have probably really enjoyed this in the 80's - but now. . . not so much. It's a little outdated - and the effects and acting are somewhat poor. I can't believe people have rated it so high - maybe it's nostalgia.
5,oh!!!!!!,"This flick is a l e g e n d. A great rendering of HP Lovecraft's vision. Before computer graphics, organic, special effects in it's hay day.One of the weirdest, sickest, most bizarre and strangely sexual movie you will ever see. My Mom described it best as some sick subterranean subconscious nitemare from underwater Hell."
1,wow,I love HP Lovecraft & I'm all up for adapting his stories but this movie is really terrible. Why can't some big Hollywood heavy weights take a risk & make an epic film or trilogy on this amazing writers talent? What a shame.
3,But is it widescreen?,Is it Widescreen?I'm glad that this as well as BODY BAG are finally coming out on DVD.
1,BEYOND BAD,From Beyond is a disappointing and terrible horror movie that fails on every level but the real shame should be that director Stuart Gordon who directed the excellent RE-ANIMATOR directs a mess like this. The plot was a good one but the horrible acting keeps it from it's potential to be at least a decent movie. Jeffrey Combs looks embarassed as well as Barbara Crampton and Ken Foree. The special effects/make-up were good but the movie is poorly made those effects don't help much. As for director Gordon this makes his first nadir(low point) next to the other Beyond the Re-Animator. This movie is BEYOND BAD. Please don't release trash like this on DVD its already bad on VHS.
4,Old school scifi/horror,"Oh man! I have been describing this movie to rental places forever and they couldn't help me find it. Now I have a name. Watching this movie today and having never seen it, you will most likely just laugh at the effects and story but this is a movie that when it was made, the special effects were shocking.If you like old school horror/gore and like seeing what old special effects were like, this is for you. It's not the best horror film out there but it's fun to see something like this from time to time."
4,Strong Female Role,"My family, including my 8-year-old daughter, love this book. The illustrations are great, the story fun and straight forward, and the ending a delightful surprise. Why does the Grizwaldo look so much like Daniel? What my family most likes about the book is the strongly positive female role model. We have many books with strong females, but Mangaboom has a light, joyful self assuredness that we have seldom seen. Really a winner."
3,nice book,"library stickers, stamped discarded, I would prefer to know this up front. Spanish edition here refers to two spanish words to each page of English. Dora the explorer speaks more Spanish than this book."
2,Not worth the time,"This book is predictable, boring, and sometimes painful to read. The heroine -- no, not heroine, as she doesn't actually DO anything -- is mildly interesting, if only there were a plot for her. The most aggravating thing, though, is the book's junior-high insistence on repeatedly replacing characters' names with ridiculous phrases. As in, ""the Frenchman"" or ""the Russian girl."" So annoying."
4,pointless but entertaining,"This is just one of those books that is pointless, but addictive and fun to read. And as far as I can remember, its written by an actual model.Its pretty much predictable though. A small town, naive girl aspiring to be a model moves to New York City after getting signed with an agency, and the agency places her in a dorm with other models. The models are all typical: you've got the naive, small town girl (the main character), the nympho model, the cokehead model, and the alcoholic model. (I can't recall if there were any other ones that lived with her)All in all its a good read, as long as your not looking for something serious to read.Its pretty much the book version of the show ""8th & Ocean"""
4,Fun and addictive!,"This is no Jane Eyre or Little Women, but it is a fun, lighthearted book, that I enjoyed reading in one big gulp. It was of course a little predictable, but fun to read nevertheless."
5,Gloomy and yet captivating,"I have always loved the dark and gloomy sounds of a band. Amorphis really hit it hard with the Castaway. But I really get carried away when listening to Black Winter Day. Keep rockin for ages to come, Amorphis."
5,"Excellent piece of heavymetal, satisfactory rating: 101%!","Heavy/deathmetal album, that really blows your mind. The lyrics are based on a finnish folk-tale, Kalevala, and are, atleast, interesting. But the music is straight from heaven. The beautiful guitar-riffs, genius atmosphere created by various instrument, and, the most important thing, it is heavy, but not _that_ heavy. It's closer to Metallica than to Impaled Nazarene. If you have any interest to heavy music, this CD is a must! If you liked this, there are also a few very good CD's you might want to check: (I have'em all) -Sentenced: AMOK -Sentenced: Love&Death (MCD) These are similar to Amorphis and are worth atleast five stars!"
2,not for extreme metal fans,Reminds me too much of all Fates Warningalbums after Awaken the Guardian.I recommend the Karelian Isthmus instead.
2,Seven Steps to Stop a Heart Attack,"I have studied heart disease since having a heart attack two years ago. Thanks to the internet, I have been able to spend hundreds of hours on stem cell research, chronic heart disease, modern drug treatment, and many other topics related to this condition. Dr. Bob Arnot's book is an outstanding effort to write a clear plan of attack for anyone affected by this condition.The book is very up-to-date. It mentions work that has taken place in the last year or so. It also manages to explain in words that most of us can easily understand what these tests mean and how they can be applied.This book was a real page turner. It is exciting and optimistic. If you ever wondered what those drugs you are taking did, then this book will tell you. If you what to know about stenting, start here. If you knew someone who had a heart by-pass ten years ago and want an update on the procedure, read this.This is a very good book."
1,Incorrect labled product,"They advertise that it is the regular concentrate formula (which works really well) & what they ship you is the Concentrate Formula II (which works but not as well as the regular concentrate). They have the UPC Code on the Concentrate II bottle tied to the regular Concentrate in their system. And when you contact them to clear it up they can not comprehend what it is that you are saying. They continue to go back to ""the UPC Code says that it is the Regular Concentrate."""
5,"for women, too","With thin, wispy, short hair, I have wasted a lot of money on hair products.Hard Up gel works better than anything else I've tried. It's not sticky and doesn't make your head feel itchy. Your hair doesn't blow around, but it's not stiff like a helmet, either. Rub a little on your hands, rub it through your hair, and you get body and style that lasts. Problem solved!I'm also ordering a small tube for travel."
4,Good product,"I received the gel in no time, the package was good and it works just fine as advertised. I recommend buying it. If it wasn't for the price I would give 5 stars."
2,OK!,"I have used this product in the past, after purchasing it at a salons and the pump feature always works great. This Gel product I have now purchased seemed to have a defect of some kind. The pump does not allow me to pump very high for the Gel to come out. And its a pain to keep using my fingers to try and lift the pump higher for the Gel to come out.Other than that the Gel is the same."
4,love it.,"I have been using this for a long time now.A little goes a long way.Holds well, without making hair stiff/crispy. Somewhat flexible.Not sticky in hair.Easily washes off hands & out of hair.Good price in this size, here on Amazon, especially compared to salons.I PREFER THE SQUEEZE TUBES, but they do not come in this size. I'd give 5 stars if it did.The pump does not get all of the gel out when it's low and worst of all the gel dries in the pump tip and then squirts out really hard and far in some random direction when you pump it, unless you dig out the tip."
5,Yaaay - found it again! Don't be fooled by the other Blue Hair Goos,"I stumbled across this on sale at Marshalls several years ago and picked it up on an impulse. I have flat hair that dies with any humidity. I have generally had great results with Aveda products but don't like the cost of Aveda and have been looking to replace it.I never realized how many blue hair goo products exist on the market and they all look the same but they aren't. I have used ""Bed Head"" and ""Got 2b"" but with very different results. Where Short Sexy Hair is a hard lasting hold, the other products don't hold well at all and leave my hair flat and dirty looking.When I purchased it before, it was in a tube and did tend to ""clump"" up so I probably will heed the other reviews' warning of the pump getting clogged and opt for a tube again.[NCJAR]"
1,Glue,"I used this on my hair and it's too much like glue to me. It does hold the hair in place, I love how it works on my sideburns. However, once you put this on you cannot comb through it or else there will be breakage. I need a good hold, but still some bendability. I'll have to pass on glue holds where you can't even run your fingers thru."
1,"It's like glue, and takes excessive shampoo and water to wash out","I don't like the smell, but worse, I can't believe how difficult it was to wash it out of my hair. Thank goodness I only used it to hold my bangs slicked back. I can't imagine how horrible the experience would have been had I used it throughout my hair. I had to shampoo twice, and use inordinate amounts of shampoo just to get it all out.I want to grow my bangs out. With this glue in my hair, I can't run my fingers through it. If you want to convert your hair into a helmet, this is the goop"
3,Beware of Pump Clogs and Breakage,"Great products and works for me as advertised but pump is highly vulnerable to clogging and if force is used to pump; crack, break, shatter, cut you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,great product,I have been using this gel for years now. I wouldn't trade it for any other. It has superior hold without leaving dandruff and usage amount is minimal.
3,"Works, but it is very drying.....","I am not a guy but I thought I would give this hair gel a try since I like the separated curl look. I have long thick curly cork screw hair. I found this to very drying after three days of using it daily and kind of expensive. I am happier with the Dep Marathon gel (orange). It is moisturizing and cheaper. Every time I go back to this gel (when I run out of Dep), I get the same drying results. Probably just because of my hair type. It does hold pretty well though.Dep #11 Gel Sport Texture 12 oz. (Orange) Marathon Hold"
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"Seeing how there are almost 100 reviews with a 4.5/5 rating, I thought I'd give this product a try despite the price. Unfortunately, it didn't work too well for me. My hair is a little under than an inch long and while it did hold my hair style in place, it failed to clump all the hair strands into bigger pieces of spikes. I guess you really must have hair shorter than 0.5"" to use this product. I've used this product with and without watered hair. It doesn't make your hair shine either.If any of you guys are looking to seriously spike your hair (regardless of hair length), stick with Got2B Ultra Glued. Has more shine and actually holds your hair in place."
4,Hair of steel.,"Here are the basics:-It makes your hair like a shield.-There's a lot of it.So if you like those two, you should get this.*note: hurricane force winds < this gel."
2,It's just OK....,The product is too sticky and is hard to work with in the hair. It also dries out my hair.
2,Was looking for a more traditional gel,"After reading all the great reviews about this product, I decided to get it. When I received it and pumped some out of the bottle, I wasn't expecting what I got. Its very gluey and sticky, did not feel like a normal gel that moves around freely in your hand. This literally felt like a hard glue in my hands. I went ahead anyway and put it in my hair, I have longer hair than just spikes on top, probably 2-3 inches around, and this gel was just too sticky to do what I wanted with my longer hair. I also have a lot of hair, as soon as the gel got into my hair it was just impossible to move it around. I quickly washed out my hair and am using L.A. Looks, a more traditional gel. In conclusion this ""gel"" didn't work for me. I gave it 2 stars because some people are looking for a very hard glue type gel and if you have very short hair to spike it probably does work, but if you like more of a water based gel and have longer hair, this is not for you."
5,Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel - 16.9 ounce pump bottle,"BEST hair gel on the market today!FREE shipping on this purchase a BIG plus, especially to Hawaii. However, method of shipping (e.g., USPS, FedEx, UPS) should be provided. I've suggested and requested for the method of shipping but have yet to get a response."
2,The pump is horrible!,"I have used this product for years and it is fantastic. The reason why it only received 2 stars is because of the pump dispenser that the product is in. The pump does not work well AT ALL. The pump get stucks constantly and only dispenses a small amount. I constantly need to ""mess with it"" for it to actually dispense the gel. The gel = phenomenal, the pump = HORRIBLE!"
5,Great gel!!!!,"I read the reviews and decided to try it even tho my cabinets are full of 'tried' products for my hair. I have fine hair and wear it very short. This stuff works great. I would not want to be without it. It does not flake and with a little encouragement, works well the second day."
3,Works great but hype is driving price too high,"This product works great but the pump problems mentioned in previous posts is real. Moreover, the hype is driving the maker to jack up the price to almost double to what I used to pay. If price does not come down I will look for alternative and cancel my Subscribe & Save. Good product but too pricey!!!"
5,Works great,This item was better than expected. Fit our drum perfectly. Good quality material. I recommend this to protect your drums.
4,Wire Shelf Dividers,"These dividers are exactly what I was looking for and work wonderfully. No stores carry these and I was very happy to find them online and to have them shipped so expeditiously.Thank you, Gigi McDonald"
1,Not worth it,"I was very disappointed with these. It's hard to find dividers for wire shelves, so I ordered several. Many of them were bent and would not fit on the shelves, and they are poorly made. I suggest you keep looking and pass these up."
3,Was able to make them work better,I've had these for a few years and had problems with them standing up straight...my husband came up with an idea that works great. We put wire ties around the front and back to hold both ends securely to the shelving and now they stand up very straight and are very sturdy. I'm ordering another set now that we know how to get them to work better.
1,"Terrible, poor quality product - don't waste your $","Two of the shelves feet fell off as I was trying to install. I didn't apply much pressure at all. This product is a total waste of $ and time. In trying to get a return authorization, I received an email from vendor asking for a detailed explanation of why I wanted to return. BEWARE."
1,WAY over priced and not very reliable,"I have had a dozen of these (paid much less somewhere else about 5 months ago) and only 4 are still working. They do not even come CLOSE to matching their description. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! They claim they will be good for reading, but they are not. They are good for accent lighting when they work."
3,Not very bright but working okay for me,"I keep use one of these bulbs in my laundry room, which does not have any windows and is perpetually dark. This bulb puts out enough light for me to walk through the room safely on my way out to the garage. The light helps our cat find its litter box, too. I don't feel guilty if I forget to turn this low-powered light off at night.But I need to turn on a brighter task light when I am ushering in guests, using the sewing machine, or looking for a book on the shelves.My bulb has been working for the better part of a year. So far, so good. Passage of time...Well, two years has passed. It is now August 2011 and the bulb has burned out recently after a little over three years (about 28,000 hours) of continuous usage. I was hoping for longer. Will try another product and hope it provides longer life."
3,A little disappointed.,I got one of these to give it a try. After trying it in a few lamps in my living room I decided that I didn't like the light it put out much. I ending up putting it in my porch light. It's not very bright but with it's low energy use I now leave it on 24/7 when I used to only turn it on if I was expecting company. I think it's fine for outside lighting if you don't need a really bright light.
3,I had expected more from C CRANE,"Usually, C. Crane has decent stuff, although I still HATE that they won't take Amex on their its website. Anyhow I ordered one of these a long time ago at a MUCH higher price, the one I ordered is still going strong. I use it over my outside door in a recessed fixture.In pitch black it has enough light to be useful. Since it sips electricity I don't mind leaving it on 24 x 7.This light is super low tech. The price now reflects that. At this price, there is almost no need to hesitate. Remember if you are using LED bulbs even now, you are an early adopter of this technologyIts color temp is not warm. Oh and VIVID it ain't :-)"
3,Ok,"This is fair, but not one of my favorites. The only reason I have this is because my neice gave it to me as a birthday present. I guess the quality of this reflects on the price. I am so much into my designer perfumes that compared with them, this is quite putrid. I guess this would be great for teenagers, but sadly not for me. It was fair at best."
5,California Coastal Wildlife And Waterfalls,"If you like waterfalls you will love this dvd.The waterfalls are really peaceful.Day 1 starts with Burney Falls.You see different falls some big some little.Waterfalls is all you will see on day 1.Day 3 starts off with a waterfall that eventually pours into the ocean.You can here both the waterfall and the waves crashing.There is also some beautiful ocean views on this disc.If you like wildlife there is plenty elephant and harbor seals,gulls etc.It even shows a seal having a baby on the island.You will also see a beautiful lighthouse on day 4 and a lake on day 2.The sunsets are beautiful.On side 2 you get Califonia Dreams with big waves.I also recommend Whispering Waters which is shot in Yosimite National Park with over 1 hour of waterfalls with natural sounds only."
4,'ware the sea lions!,"I liked my Hawaiian Dream dvd so much, I purchased this California Coastal Wildlife and Waterfalls. They are both wonderful, but I would have liked to see more waterfalls and bubbling brooks in this one, and fewer waves. Another viewer commented that the sea lion scene is visually disturbing; I'll add that the sound of the animals barking is sharp and discordant--always wakes me up if I'm drowsing."
5,enjoyable,"This book details the history of Henry VIII's two sisters. Which is fascinating on its own considering the majority of the history of that time is taken up recounting the affairs of Henry. This account is readable in the extreme and quite enjoyable. A large majority of the book is taken up in detailing the history of Margaret who became Queen of Scotland when she married James IV. The second portion details Mary who became very quickly the widowed Queen of France married to Louis XII. Both sisters lived through harsh conditions and were used to the utmost by their cold and calculating brother Henry VIII. A worthy history to read, particularly useful in fleshing out the rest of the picture in regards to the early years of Henry before he started cycling through wives."
2,New parent,"I bought this product because we have little children in the house. the corners are barely tufted with any padding -the wood frame is very hard underneath the fabric. it gives a false sense of padding/security.Otherwise, it looks just as it appears on the web. You really get what you pay for. Buyer beware."
1,don't waste your money on this!,"What a cheap product for such a high price! It literally falls apart. I have now purchased 2 of them because my son loves it, but all of the plastic connectors have broken and are now taped together. It's a very poor design with poor parts. I would understand if he was aloud to play and jump in it, but he doen not! Only sleeps. Even though there are mesh vents in the top, no air goes through them. My son was always sweaty in it. I ended up cutting out 2 of the panel, which helped with air flow. I would recommend trying to build you own out of PVC. That's my next try."
4,A truly frightening video produced by courageous people,"This is a truly frightening video. I saw it on PBS. It shows the actual melting of ice on both the northern and southern ends of our planet. The people who made this film truly had courage. There is an element of horror watching a man lower himself into a giant hole in the ice hundreds of feet deep. The footage from Greenland was particularly disturbing, showing how holes in the ice are now opening up inland as the ice melts and water pours from under the ice to the sea. The staff of this show deserves a lot of credit for the courage they showed in going out and getting this footage for us."
3,PDF Images dull,"As compared to other titles produced by Graphic Imaging Technology (GIT), this title is just below the quality of the other 7 titles that I own such as 40 Years of Avengers, 40 Years of X-Men, Captain America-The Complete Collection, etc. Image quality is OK, they just didn't use very good original pages to create the PDF's from so the images are not very sharp. If you are a Ghost Rider fan, it's a good collection to have. It would've been a great collection had GIT used better quality source material to scan."
1,GHOST RIDER COMPLETE COMIC COLL.,I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW TO RATE BECAUSE WHEN I RECEIVED IT IN THE MAIL IT WAS NOT IN THE CD CASE PROPERLY & THE CD WAS SCRATCHED UP & DOESN'T EVEN WORK. IF THIS HOW I WILL RECEIVE ORDERS- THEN I WON'T ORDER FROM HERE ANY MORE! VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1,Files on disc are corrupt and will not open,"I have had two of these discs so far and neither one would allow me to open issue #45. According to GIT Corporation tech support there is a corrupt file on the Master disc. Here is the response they sent to my email inquiry. ""The problem does not lye with the discs, but with a corrupt file on the Master. The Ghost Rider collection is now in the process of being re-mastered. When they become available, we will post exchange info on the site. No definite date yet, as it an extremely time consuming process.""GIT's ""knowledge base"" does not even list this known problem and it appears they have not recalled the defective discs and are still allowing them to be sold.I would be very wary of buying this product until the problem is corrected."
5,"mucho mas que ""standarts""","No solo se trata de las canciones de siempre, esas canciones que nos vienen a la memoria sin saber muy bien como, sobre todo a los que nos gusta el cine musical de los años 30 y 40, sino que la Pasadena Roof Orchestra los interpreta con el sabor de esos años. La Orquesta nació en los 60, en medio de la explosion del Rock, y tuvo exito precisamente por su sonido ""retro"", es decir, autentico; no adaptaba las viejas canciones y melodias al gusto rock y pop, como hicieron otras, sino que intentó, e intenta aun, mantener ese sonido popular de los 20, 30 y 40 que popularizo el jazz y las melodias de Brodway por todo el mundo."
3,"Accurate, but dry","The book is very thorough in its chronicling of Ceco Corporation's founding and its growth through the 1960s. Typical of a lot of corporate histories, it is dry reading. I guess it's hard to add sparkle to any company, much less a company who specialized in concrete and steel construction materials.Still, the company's history is intertwined with a lot of urban history all across the U.S. I found myself thinking, 'Huh. I didn't know Ceco was involved in that construction project.' I would be more inclined to read this as part of the history of construction and less as a list of dates and details about the company."
3,A prayer workbook,"Praying Backwards: Transform Your Prayer Life by Beginning in Jesus' NameThis book is written like a prayer workbook or instructional guide. A better name for this book would be Praying With Jesus First. Praying Backwards is negative title.Reading words or prayers reverse or backwards is a technique of the occult. The introduction is well written. Each chapter begins with an illustration , or story before presenting the topic of the chapter. That is backwards of tradition presenting the main topic and then examples.The content is not the problem but the format.There is no doubt that Bryan Chapell is a spirit filled christian with years of theology education and is sincere.The content is not the problem but the format. The book could have been formatted better"
4,A Fun Read,"A very British, delightful & quirky read. Would like to find some similar ones for light reading. And love my Kindle!"
3,Maybe i haven't given it enough of a chance,I started this book but hav put it to the side. It didn't catch my interest but that might be due to the mood I was in when I started it. I will pick it up again next month and give it another try
3,A pleasant & silly read. I liked it.,"It is a farce and well-written. Simple, amusing and light reading, not as entertaining as The Girl on The Boat but still good. If you like Vampires and really gory murder mysteries with ghastly descriptions, you will probably find this one boring."
3,stupid,Its confusing and boring. Waste. I didnt like it cause the stupid peplle are stupid and it diesnt make any sense. It was boring and not worth it
1,does basically nothing,"Well, I am sorry I bought this, the old Maybelline curler works as well. I don't see what the fuss is about and I can't return it. Bummer.I might try a heated one."
2,Leave it at the store!!!!!,"Just one piece of advice to anyone who feels Y&T produced nothing but weak singalong songs after Mean Streak: don't even bother to listen to this one, cause it's very clear why these songs never made it into one of their even weakest releases.....90% of the songs here are so lame they should've stayed 'uncovered'.Why 2 stars then?? Well, one for the 2 really good tracks on this release and one because no matter what....Y&T will always have a special place in this 37 year old's heart!!"
5,Y&T is back!!,Man! Couldn't have asked for a better band to reunite than Y&T. Always a crowd pleasing favorite and this cd is no let down at all. I consider Joey Alves as the original guitaritst but this newer guy still rocks along. Whether you're an old die hard Y&t fan or just getting into them;YOU GOTTA GET THIS ONE!!
5,Unreleased treasures,"This CD was my introduction to Y&T. I got it thinking it was a greatest hits CD. Then, I come to find that it is unreleased material. My thought was, ""If this is the stuff that didn't make the cut then I HAVE to hear what did!"" This is a fantastic CD. Vol. 2 is good as well, albeit not as good as Vol. 1. ""Wild If I Wanna"" is the highlight of the disc for me. This song should have been a single. If you have ever liked anything Y&T has done then buy this CD. You won't be disappointed."
3,Works but slippery,"I use this regularly when I do yoga, but it's not perfect. It's slippery, so it has to be under the yoga mat. I don't know how much more effective it is than just rolling up the edge of your mat. However, I use it, as I said, and it does eliminate a little bit of wrist pain."
5,NOVA opens the universe to better understanding,"NOVA provides excellent quality programs! The photography is spectacular, the shows are balanced and interesting, the field scientists are highlighted - NOVA makes science come alive for us!"
5,Very Pleased,I've been very pleased with Amazon and will continue to make purchases online through them. My Waterman purchased is no exception. I've always preferred Waterman pens due to the quality of the workmanship and the way they write.
5,Read it over and over again,"I wish I had the foresight to buy more of Ellen Conford's books from the late 70s, early 80s. I reread this book probably once a year, because it still is very funny and speaks to all the fears and dreams a teenage girl has. I always loved Ellen Conford, because she wrote about normal kids who did their homework, didn't do drugs and had both good and bad teachers in their classes. Julie is a great heroine because she's pretty normal, and therefore you can relate to her, her crushes, her family, her friends and her insecurities. As always, the moral is that you, as a teenaged female, are just great the way you are. Another plus for Ms. Conford."
4,Media Mama,"This bowl is perfect for small servings of treats such as fruit, pudding or ice cream. It is also perfect, when used with others of the same size, for condiments for burger night or for olives, onions and lemons for martini night. They do well in the dishwasher, but be careful when eating out of them, the lighter colors scratch easily."
5,Excellent CD,"This really is an excellent CD. I bought it without knowing anything about Led Kaapana and I made a good pick. In my opinion, there's only one song I don't care for, but all others sound great. Excellent island flavor; no imitation Hawaiian sounds that some artists do to make you think you're in Hawaii. Pick it up...you'll be glad you did."
4,Classic Led,"This is a good example of classic Led kiho'alu guitar virtuosity that, for me, is improved by a total lack of Led's falsetto singing. Many fans of Led and Hawaiian music will disagree, but I personally dislike the falsetto singing style. This is mostly an instrumental album of six and twelve string guitar, with an interesting addition of two pieces played on the autoharp. This is a solid album that will appeal to any fans of Hawaiian Slack Key guitar."
5,love it,"I found this book abandoned in a give-away pile. one night out of boredom i happened to start reading it and couldn't believe how instantly it sucked me in.the stories - which were all completely unfamiliar to me - are totally dreamy and magical in quality.they are not as grotesque or morbid as many brothers grimm fairy tales. a common and refreshing theme throughout is one of good deeds being rewarded, and bad deeds being punished and/or corrected and learned from.it makes for a wonderfully whimsical and uplifting bedtime read.I want more!"
4,But wait; there's more !,"I couldn't agree more with the 3 other reviews here. However, I would like to add something. Instead of throwing down $20 to get this hard-to-find early hardcore gem from 1984 (that contains only 7 tracks by the way), try to find the following compilation: ""A Time We'll Remember Vol.7"". Here you will find this entire Drop Dead playlist + 2 extra songs ""Life Of Hate"" and ""Armageddon"". This comp. is hard to find too. I only know of 1 site that carries it. But there are 40+ tracks on it by Siege, Void (legendary DC split cd with Faith), Deep Wound (J Mascis) and Septic Death (live tracks from 1986). Sorry to write up an opinion about a totally separate disc, but... Just sayin'Siege is for fans of: Dropdead, Negative FX, Death Sentence, Ripcord, Despise You, Crossed Out, Suppression, Confrontation, C.R, Capitalist Casualties and even Poison Idea. It's legendary fastcore.- Jay in Texas"
5,The legendary classic,"Students of economics, from nations that were formerly British colonies would be familiar with this text. A landmark achievement in the genre of introductory economics texts. Very well written, lucid and easy to understand. This book will make you fall in love with the subject of economics. A panoramic vision of economics including both macro and micro economics is sketched in a simple, and easy to understand style. A true masterpiece, falling in the category of Paul Samuelson's classic ""Economics""."
3,A FROG CLASSIC,"SILVERCHAIR[s debut FROGSTOMP is a FROG CLASSIC from the 90[s, with many good songs like PURE MASSACRE and TOMORROw...but after many years, i gotta notice that SILVERCHAIR[s debut is a COMPLETE GRUNGE clone!!!!! some songs sound exactly like songs from Alice in Chains, Nirvana and pearl Jam.....the boys from Silverchair were very talented for their age, i think they had 15 years at the time, but the influences goes WAY beyond any originality....man, Suicidal dream is just like BLEED THE FREAK, from Alice in Chains....some songs are TOTAL NIRVANA style and some like SHADE and PURE MASSACRE, got vocals on a COMPLETE Eddie Vedder vibe!!!! i really enjoy this album, but the total lack of originality here is bizarre....try the originals Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam......"
5,i dream about how its gonna end...,"I am a relatively new silverchair fan. I like this album, i think it is filled with emotion and feeling. It has it's mellow and its hard parts. Suicidal Dream is such a great song. Yes, it is somewhat disturbing cause it is about suicide, but i think the band did an excellent job of portraying what it is like to be contemplating suicide."
4,Talented,"When I heard that Silverchair produced this album when they were fourteen, I had my share of doubts. But, when I borrowed it from a friend, I was instantly impressed. This is a solid, well rounded, and dependable album you can listen to over and over. Daniel Johns has a very emotional, even if it is premature, voice and a precocious writer. Obviously, all three members of Silverchair are especially talented musicians that work surprisingly well together, and give off a powerful meaning and a full sound. Although there are definite signs of their favorite musicians, Nirvana and Pearl Jam, I think that they developed a creative sound of their own. I also can't label grunge on them, for some reason, but a mixture of grunge, rock, and punk. All in all it is a very strong album and a fantastic debut. Although there are some weak songs and out-of-place guitar riffs, this is the best Silverchair album of all. Get it, it's worth every cent."
4,solid rock cd,"this album simply doesn't get the respect it deserves, because some people (without ears) think they sound like nirvana. now, i'll admit nirvana and silverchair have some similarities. those similarities are that the lead singers looked similar, both bands had a heavy guitar and played grungey rock music.that's about where the similarities end.anyway, this is a solid rock album. the first 4 songs all rock like a mother, ""shade"" and ""suicidal dream"" are calmer songs, and the other songs are good hard rockers too.besides two not-so-incredible songs (""madman"" and ""cicada"") this is a good hard rock album and silverchair's a good hard rock album.but while you're at it, pick up ""neon ballroom"" and ""diorama"" to hear genius of a different manner. :)"
2,Over Rated...,The problem I have with silverchair's debut album is that even though the production is tight (in an early 90's grunge kind of way) and silverchair are aussie rock's biggest poster boy's since AC/DC; Frogstomp still sounds like a collection of polished demos by three 15 year olds instead of the classic aussie rock album that it's been hyped up as. The songwriting comes off as teenage wining instead of angst and the music doesn't have the power that's needed to drive any of the songs home convincingly. It wasn't until 1999's Neon Ballroom where the band started to live up to their reputation as Australia's definative rock band of the 90's.
1,daniel johns is trying to be the next curt cobain,Silverchair is a poor band. This cd doesn't mean a thing to me at all. Daniel johns needs to know that you don't get far in life if you act like curt cobain.
5,Excellent CD,"frogstomp is an excellent debut album from silverchair. The album defiantly has a grunge influence, but it is more than that. Songs like ""Shade"" and ""Leave Me Out"" are beautiful ballads. A great album to purchase if you like the gunge scene."
5,the reason i know and love silverchair,"frogstomp is the first of silverchair's albums. it's hits include ""israel's son"", and ""tomorrow"", which are the two songs that introduced me to one of my favorite bands; silverchair. i find this album to be very opinionated in a political standpoint and highly intellectual. i love this cd."
5,Silverchair is a great band! They RULE!!!,"This was the very first CD I got by Silverchair and now they are my fav. band! This CD is AWESOME! If you want the best Alt/Rock, buy this CD. I got mine from this dude who charged me 7 bucks for it, what a moron! Anyways... This CD IS what rock is all about."
5,brilliant,Silverchair aren't like Nirvana you fools. you'd have to add a healthy dose of the stuff that was coming out of New York in the early 90's to Nirvana for there to be a comparison.This album is all good. Simple but most good songs are.
3,Decent debut from the Australian teens,"With a sound that appealed to angst-ridden teens and a look that attracted teen girls, Silverchair hit on a formula that was bound to be huge. Their debut album, Frogstomp, is quite impressive considering that the members of SC were all around the age of 15 when they recorded it. Some of the songs are heavy and in the vein of bands like Helmet. Their flaws come out when they get sentimental, on songs like ""Shade"", which had vocals and lyrics that made me cringe. Lyrics are a weakness of the band, with such goofy lines as ""I fantasize about my death / I'll kill myself from holding my breath"" (from ""Suicidal Dream""). Those flaws aside, they still manage to come up with intense rockers that tackle powerful themes, with the strongest tracks being ""Israel's Son"", ""Tomorrow"", ""Faultline"", and ""Undecided"". There is better grunge rock out there (Soundgarden, Nirvana, SC's ""Freak Show""), but this is recommended if you are a major fan of the genre."
3,"It's OK, quite good for a debut...","certainly nothing to be ashamed of as a debut... they couldn't be blamed for showing their influences so much; they were concentrating on making a good album, so good for them. There ARE some great songs on here, like ""Israel's Son"", even though the riff rips off Pearl Jam's ""Even Flow"" (like I said, big whup) and ""Tomorrow"" of course, even if the CD has a ""sameness"" to it. But if you like the stuff, then that's an upside."
5,Why compare them to Nirvana,They were 15 or 16 when they recorded this album and its absolutley amazing.Its much more pleasant to listen to than alot of the electric guitar stuff Nirvana did.Daniel Johns compared to Kurt Cobain - f*ck off! This album equals Nirvana! Maybe not revolutionary wise but I think its as good and as satisfying.
1,"Well, they could only have gotten better.","This record is an embarassment to own. I wish I could give it zero stars. Some of the songs are so childish that the point is completely lost. These guys seem completly torn between thier influences (lyrically speaking, thier musical influences are all too obvious). I wish these guys all the best in their careers, but please, for the sake of good taste, do not buy this album."
5,a good starter for a band straight out of Australia,"Silverchair's debut album, Frogstomp, is definatly a good mix of Rock, Grunge and whatever else is incorperated here. Good hits like Shade, Israel's Son, Faultline, Findaway (my personal favorite) are here to stay and will go down in Music history.I have been a fan of silverchair since 1999, when the single, Ana's Song came on the radio...but enough about me. I just think that this CD was their best and i hope to see more from them in the future.~K*Baggins~"
3,It's An Open Top Slipcase,"It's not what I thought it would be. It does not have a belt clip. Nor is it fully enclosed. It has a nice quality cover for the front and back. The sides are elastic so that it expands when you slide the unit in. Consequently, the top is exposed. I also discovered a tendency to press the record button when pulling the unit out. However, I have not had that problem ever since I started inserting the unit top first leaving the bottom exposed instead. Also this protects the media card from being ejected by accident. The case does the job of protecting the Garmin from scratches. Fits in a pocket nicely."
4,Excellent if you know what you're ordering,"I ordered the Garmin slipcase with some trepidation after reading the negative review here. It is indeed a slipcase, but what I was looking for was a case that offers protection without bulk, and this fills the bill. All the other generic cases I've seen are bulkier than this one.The case is well-made with a good quality padded leather front and back. The sides are elastic to allow a snug fit for the slightly wedge-shaped iQue. I haven't had any problems with removing the iQue without pressing the record button--it just requires a bit more care. It would also have been nice to have a flap to close over the top of the case. The open top leaves the card slot exposed. But overall I'm very pleased with the compactness and quality of this case."
3,"Good for protection, not for use","This item does what it says, but not as well as many others. The iQue slides in, but then becomes unusable. There are other cases with a design that allows for the protection, but you do not have to remove the case in order to use the iQue.If you do not care about having to remove the device to use it, however, it is a quality case. Well constructed, and a good grade of leather."
3,Not so entertaining,"My 5-year old doesn't spend the same amount of time on it as she does w/Reader Rabbit, Madeline, or Dr. Seuss. It doesn't offer a lot places to visit...Basically just 4 games and that's it."
4,THERE'S FRICTION IN THE HERD!,Living on the northern range it's not unusual to see buffalo! But DONNA THE BUFFALO now there is something seldmon seen on the northern range. This 6 piece electric acoustic herd takes you on a journey through old-time appalachian music and then links you up with Ralph Stanley and then just for good measure adds some Bob Marley. POSITIVE FRICTION connects rock reggae and folk zydeco ... with lots to listen to in between. DONNA THE BUFFALO are hot as a prairie fire. This is something fun on a Saturday night sitting on the front porch watching the buffalo. They mix old and new and tie themselves together with comfortable rhythms and technical skill. Keep this CD in the front of your collection because you'll play it lots! So show me a home where the buffalo roam ... and this CD will be ready you. And did I mention the cover ... it's good too!
2,It barely deserves anything,"It's the worst anime I've ever seen. How did this get popular enough to be released here? Watch Ninja Scroll, Akira, A wind named Amnesia, Judge, Ghost in the shell, Macross Plus. This is garbage."
1,Yikes!,"This movie really is a waste of money...I wasn't able to figure out what was going on most of the time.... didn't even know who the bad guys and the good ones were. The ""hero"" was constantly screaming like he was close to a nervous breakdown ( he was supposed to be a technologically enhanced super being or ...whatever). There was also a lot of disgusting stuff (suprise) in it, like humans being torn apart slowly and bit by bit. Not bad BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. There was lots of action, no humor, no sex (booooh!)... anyway, if you like anime chaos at its height, go ahead, buy it."
1,Terrible.,"If they call this an anime, I say: WHAT A SHAME! Not only is this movie too short, it's got bad voices for every single charicter, lousy animation (But that's just cause it's an 80's show), and does every voice need to ecco? If that's not bad enough, all the acting was more lousy than the animation. Plus the plot is not well develiped. Don't even rent this movie."
3,come on guys,"Let me start out by saying I love Lynyrd Skynyrd. The old band and the new. Which is why I am dissapointed with this release. I have all these songs already, why should I buy this CD. In the spin magazine article ""Encore from hell"" the current line up made it appear that they wanted to be recognized for their new material on ""Twenty"" and ""Edge of Forever"". So why put out this CD? The band already released an ""Extended Play"" CD with similiar songs. Come on guys write some new stuff, ""Twenty"" and ""Edge of Forever"" were great albums, keep putting out new songs. I would recommend this CD to Skynyrd novices, to hear the new line up, they rock! If you don't want to be considered just a tribute band then keep releasing new material. The market is flooded with Skynyrd greatest hits records. We don't need any more."
2,you've got to be kidding me...,"i'm sorry folks, but it's time this band gave up. even if ronnie van zant were alive today, this band would be at the breaking point, and without him, they simply cannot make it. these guys have had a long and prosperous career, but it's time to hang it up. this album is a good example: while it is not totally worthless, the band retains almost none of the style that took them to the top of the charts 25 years ago. if you can honestly say you liked the music clips available for this album, then you can try buying it; otherwise, look for classic skynyrd, the ones we all loved."
1,Beware - it doesn't come with a power supply,"If you don't already have a power supply compatible with this charger, you will need to order one - which is another $40+ shipping. That is one heck of an expensive cradle.I can't understand why power supply unit is not included with this. When was the last time you bought a piece of electronics when you had to order power supply separately? If the idea was to componentize it, there should've been an option/product with power supply included.Garmin GPSs rock but Garmin ripoff continues."
5,EXCELLENT,This is a great punk rock classic. I used to love it and was very pleased to find it on Amazon!
2,Cheap,The book is made of those newsprint-type papers and the print is crooked on the page. The solitaire rules are very sparce and miss most of the rules I was looking for.
2,May be how they warehouse them???,"Every scratch and sniff book I have gotten at Amazon has had very faint smells, almost to the point of being nonexistent - even those wrapped in plastic. I have had better luck getting them at stores. I have had to send several back."
1,The pain!,"As a fan of Michelle Yeoh, I was embarassed to see her in this film. The acting was abysmal. The special effects were probably the best part of the film. Fight scenes were mediocre and boring. This ranks up there with the recently released House of Fury. The cheese is laid on thick and the characters have little or no development. You can tell from the first 5 minutes what this movie is going to be like, a real stinker. Don't waste your money. It's awful."
1,"Silverhawk, save your money","If you like a lot of action and stunts but no substance, plot or real acting then you will like this movie"
2,Comic Book,"Asian production of a comic book of the same name. Doesn't offer much except some martial arts violence scenes. I wouldn't want to see it again, but maybe worth a rental. Contains several scenes of actors speaking in the asian language,"
2,Mixed Bag,"This 2 disc DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment has 6 movies(3 on each disc). The 1938 classic Mi Candidato starring Pedro Armendariz Sr. and Domingo Soler is on disc two while most of the movies are raunchy sex comedies that you can't watch with yo' momma! Although, this set does include Nosotros Los Pelados(1984), a solid comedy-drama. Todos Queremos Con Ella is on disc 2; it's in really bad shape! The filmmakers didn't even clean up the audio tracks in post-production and I had to turn my TV all the way up so I could hear the movie. This DVD set is recommended only for hard core fans of Mexican movies."
2,Not at all what I was expecting,"I bought this at a large warehouse store (not sure why Amazon says it is not released yet?) I also bought Volume 2. Judging by the cover I thought it was a collection of movies about puppies, not realising the movie names are classic movies.The movies are:The RetrieversQuigleyCastle Rock (read the reviews for this movie, it is NOT for small kids!!)BenjiBenji: Off the leash.I won't be watching any of them with my kids, especially not the Castle Rock movie. The DVD cover has a ""family approved"" sticker on the front but I don't agree."
3,"'The Devil Rides Out', Doctor Who style","One of the most popular Doctor Who serials, with both fans and the cast, 'The Daemons' is adapted by then-series producer and co-author of the original script.Professor Horner plans to open a barrow known as the Devil's Hump, and the Doctor and Jo head off to stop him. They arrive just too late, as the barrow is opened on the stroke of midnight, releasing an ancient power.Allied with Miss Hawthorne, the local white witch, the Doctor and his UNIT allies find themselves face to face with a force from before the beginning of history and the Master, who is endeavouring to bring this power under his control...The illustrations are passable but not terribly good.This story has strong roles for all the regulars, as well as Miss Hawthorne, and should satisfy most readers who are fond of this period of Doctor Who's history."
3,Needs more Doctor,"This one has a decent plot, but lacks the ""pulp"" feeling that many of the other novilizations have. It also seems to have more scenes in it that do not involve the Doctor. The Doctor is assisted by Jo in this one as he attempts to save the world (again :) The Master makes a return as the Doctor's opponent. I found the ending of this one to be rather mundane, somewhat anti-climactic.All in all an OK read, but not one of the best. Not sure if all the editions of this one are illustrated, but mine was with a handful of pictures mixed in to the book. The book also seemed longer than many of the novelizations, weighing in at 180+ pages rather than the typical 120 or so."
3,"Entertaining, not particularly ""funny""","I'm surprised other reviews qualify this book as riotously funny.It isn't.Case in point, discussing the odds of finding a four leaf clover, he describes a particular member of the plant's family as ""a genetic mutation, like Carrot Top"". Oh! Oh ho ho. A jab at Carrot Top! What wit!The book is full of these weak attempts, and I don't recall a single one that made me laugh. A few chuckles, but it was almost painful, like watching a standup comic trying too hard. It wasn't even ""So bad it's funny"", it went beyond that, to the point where it's just not good.The book IS interesting, and makes great bathroom reading (something the author seems a little proud of in the introduction), but it is entertaining despite the lame attempts at humor, not because of them."
2,a few facts at four leaf clovers,"i am featured in this book, my four leaf clover distribution is covered in the last chapter, there are several inaccuracies because the interview was done via transatlantic telephone call and i was not given the opportunity to proofread it. Our Gritbins were marked, grit and determination (not Grim and Determination) my husband is called Alexander not William, I studied at University of Wales Caerleon (not Claereon), and our clover scientist is Terry (not Penny) Michaelson Yeates,Please if you buy this book, print this and add it as a footnote!"
4,My Relative,"When I spent summers in Dusseldorf as a child, my grandmother read and translated portions of this book for me because Anselm Stolz was my grandfather's relative --cousin I believe. What a fine thing to see that it has been translated. His contention that mysticism is more an everyday phenomenon rather than ecstatic experience is one that still makes sense to me. If the basic insight about the ordinariness of some extraordinary things could be accepted it might be a better world. Truly, a man's reach must exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"
3,Cry in your beer all the way home.,Trucker Red laments about the trials and tribulations of absentee fatherhood and life on the road.
2,read because it was a 2nd chance story,"So I read this book because it was a second chance story. However, I felt that the romance aspect got lost in the ""mystery story"". It didn't feel so much like a romance. I've noticed that a lot with these stories though. There is so much else going on rather than focusing on the relationship I feel like I've been diverted into the spy/mystery/murder world. I guess if I wanted to read that genre I would have read a book like that.I really don't like it when one of the characters is basically sentenced to death and there isn't a lot to do about it. Not sure of the laws back then, but come on . . . she brought him to the authorities attention!!! She was a young child when she was ""forced"" to do some of the things that she had to do. I don't believe that she killed that man! Did David ever acknowledge that? David did betray her though,but I guess all that is okay since he was doing if for the greater good, right????"
2,Did we read the same book?,"Despite the original plotting, I just could not get in to this book. Still, I pushed on, thinking that such a good premise was bound to lead some where interesting. It did not.This book had everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, except a compelling romance. Which is kind of sad. I liked the characters(for the most part), but they became lost in the kitchen sink story telling. Sometimes less really is more,"
3,accuracy?,"I like the book but I don't know if the acronym GARP is ""Group Address Resolution Protocol"" or ""Generic Attribute Registration Protocol"" that's from 802.1D. If these two are the same, I should give the book 4 stars."
2,No comprehensive treatment for any of the topics,"If you just want to have an overview of the topics mentioned, the book is fine. But if you want to go deeper - this book will dissapoint you. I bought this book and regret it now."
1,buzzwords only,I found this book useless. The author obviously knows all the buzzwords but very little technical detail.
3,Building Switched Networks,The author presents a decent overview in this book. The depth I was expecting was not present and so it was let down but to somebody who wants a overview this could be a good book. Hence 3 stars
2,Definitely faux,"Improbable scenerio. A trailer trash petty thief from Oklahoma becomes a pillar of a respected London auction house and there she encounters some like-minded scam artists. I ventured here on the recommendation of a friend and was far less charmed than she was. An anemic ""Thomas Crown Affair"" that might have been helped by some Michel Legrand music."
4,Lots of Fun,"In Kick Keswick, Marne Davis Kellogg has created a heroine with a life that anyone would desire (well, except maybe for that jewel thievery thing). A beautiful flat, stunning clothes, good food, exceptional wine and a sharp brain to boot - Kick has it all. And she may be about to get one more object of desire in the love of a handsome, rich and talented lover. When Kick begins to sense danger both at home and in her work at an ancient auction house, things begin to get really, really fun.Kellogg's crisp, sure writing keeps the plot moving and never gives in to gimmickry. She's done her research, too, with superlative descriptions of jewels, paintings, and other trifles that fill the auctioneer's life. The reader actually feels as if part of the room being described - the writing is that vivid.Definitely a recommended read. Perfect to enjoy on a languid spring night along with a glass of wine."
5,Great Service,I found this hard to find item on Amazon at a reasonable price. Delivery was fast and the item is perfect.
5,Just a little note...,"This book is now published as The Water Mirror. No word yet on the translation of book two in the series but, this is brilliant, fast-paced and it makes you think. I believe some of the subject matter might be a little much for today's conservative america but, if you are an open minded parent and wish to raise your children in the same manner, then I suggest this book. Gotta love it when a child is forced to make an agreement with the devil in order to save the goddess of Venice, right?"
3,"not dismally bad, but approaching.",I have to first say I respect the composition skill an playing of the musicians on this tribute album and their selection of material. Among the songs on this disc are some of my favorites of DB's more contemporary work. The overwhelming odor of death that permeates this disc overshadows the beauty of it. On tracks like the Motel the playing is pompous and overbearing as an insufficiently talented guitar player attempts to usurp the song's strength with the raw uncontrolled flutter of an overeffected accoustic guitar. Only buy this disc if you feel so compelled that you have no option.
1,"God-awfull ""music""!!!","I think i rather listing to rap or gospel music then mortician because their ""music"" can actullie sound worse then cannibal corpse's music,sfu,deicide,ac,pig destroyer, i mean, its worse then listining to that crap! All the ""songs"" sounds the same and the production? Laughable, same with the vocals...Disgrace. As i was listining to this garbage ? I kept getting a huge headache! Jesus, i like extreme music too but mortician is just awfull! Try listining to better bands that are actullie BRUTAL and better..Such as Cryptopsy,circle of dead children(a amazing grind band),dyingfetus,kataklysm,cephalic-carnage,commit-suicide,scar-culture,today is the day,morbid angel, and do not support this utterly disgrace/excuse for music, like craptician. Do not buy mortician's ""hacked up for barbecue"" or any of their other works for that matter!"
2,not good,the songs are short and crude sounding. great bass and drumming but. a little bit too nu-metal.
1,music?,"Why anyone would want to spend their money on this piece of filth is beyond me. Mortician have a reached a new low in the already unrespectable genre of grind, as it seems the band has just down-tuned their guitars to a horror movie backdrop (which gets VERY old after 5 tracks) just for the sake of sickening people and creating an excuse for music. Sure, Cannibal Corpse does the same thing, but at least they sound good while doing it. Mortician just doesn't make the grade here, as not a speck of decent musicianship or songwriting is evident anywhere on this entire ""album."" Spend your valued cash elsewhere, metalheads. You have been warned..."
4,A GOOD SECOND RELEASE.,"The sound production on this album is much better than their first,but I still prefer the first cd.The songs are insanely fast and heavy.This cd has the classic trademark sound of mortician and I would recommend this cd to any fan of the band.Over all,a solid and good release of this extreme band."
3,"I don't like it, but it deserves some credit.","I don't really like this band, but they aren't terrible. Even though I don't like Mortician I have to give them credit for being unique, creative, and original. The clips from horror movies add to the sickness, but I find them to be too long and rather annoying. This cd has it's share of brutality and sickness, but not to the level of Cannibal Corpse and Carcass. The song ""necrocannibal"" is very good and my favorite from the Cd. This album is for a metal fan with an open mind. Here are a few gore/grindcore bands: Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, Exhumed, Impaled, Abscess, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Converge, Diabolic, Dying Fetus, Cephalic Carnage, Decapitation, and Regurgitation."
1,A Mystery...,"I'm not sure why this type of ""music"" exists, or who listens to it, or what record company would record it and try to sell it. Sure, listening to a cacophony of drumming while some guy belches is funny for a little while, but it gets tiresome. Deicide, Morbid Angel, etc. are bad enough, but Mortician have triumphantly ascended to a new plateau of lameness in the dull, stupid world of death metal. I guess I'll never understand...."
5,senses of [place,"Geneva, like Rochester (where I live) is in the heart of the ancient Iriquois Confederacy. As such, it has its own place-ness, and Tall discovers this in her wonderful book. To have a sense of place is to feel both in the now and in the past, to see the links and feel them--and this book does just that. Through it we feel the texture of place--a feeling many of us are deprived of. I loved this book, and strongly recomment it."
5,Pro Force Heavyweight karate uniform white,"I have owned the Heavyweight 14oz. uniform for ten years. They hold up pretty well. I only had one pair that ripped doing a knife demonstration. Yes, there are karate uniforms out there that are much better but dollar for dollar it is a good uniform. We would always have three to five uniforms in our dojo. We would have about three from ProForce and the other two were a different brand. But I find the brush cotton to be a little better then the Diamond. Pro Force is a great brand if you need to have more then two uniforms. Most instructors have a few uniforms at the ready in case they are called upon to teach the class; in case the regular instructor is running late or just could not make the class that night you will have a karate uniform at the ready. Best wishes and have a great workout!"
5,Goyescas and more.,"This superb collection brings together some of Enrique Granados' most wonderful solo piano music. ""Goyescas"" is a sprawling suite of six pieces inspired by impressions of Goya's paintings. Its wild, sprawling textures are redolent of Rachmaninoff or Debussy, but with flamboyant and passionate Spanish temperament, wild and soaring melodies. They are deeply moving, enormously challenging to play, and richly rewarding for performer and listener alike.Also in the collection are some of his early, delicate ""Spanish Dances"" as well as the ""Escenas Poeticas"" and ""Escenas Romanticas."" These are more reminiscent of the character pieces of Schumann or Grieg, but imbued with Granados' unique harmonic flavors and temperament.Wonderful music, in a definitive edition, reprinted by Dover ""for a song,"" this volume is a treasure for lovers of great piano music.mike@media.mit.edu"
2,You will be sorry if you pay the hardback book,I was very sorry for paying the book in hardback. I should have wait for the paper back. Then the cost would not hurt so bad. I read the great book German Boy and was looking forward to this one.Boy was I sorry it does have some good points but far and few in between. Wait for the paper back or look for another book to read.
3,"useful, surprising and inspiring","As an amateur prop and model builder I stumbled across this book after first reading Thurston James' bible on molding and casting. Although not as comprehensive as that book, and feeling a little dated, this book nonetheless is packed with useful, surprising and inspiring information. Some of the projects he describes do rely on a pretty well equipped workshop but there is still plenty here that anyone could attempt."
4,Very Solid Guide To Making Props,"""The Theater Props Handbook"" is a fantastic guide to making a almost any stage or movie prop you could need. This is a fairly detailed work with good (but Black and White) photos showing the most important steps and the provided examples are generic enough to be applied to other projects (wood grains and other finishes, for example).I learned a good bit and picked up some interesting ideas just by paging through the book. This will likely be my ""go to"" guide for hard to build projects for a long time to come.Recommended! I also recommendThe Prop Builder's Molding & Casting Handbook, by James"
4,A thought-provoking read!,"The Bridge Club is a good coming-of-age story. The protagonist, Kate, is a character with whom we can all relate: a high-strung teenager eager to change the world despite her limited views. The fervor with which she faces her struggles propels the reader through the climactic ending. All this-combined with the brilliant symbolism of a not-so-far-off storm, the bridge itself and the court of life-make for a thought-provoking read."
5,better than I expected.,"I wasn't sure how a created Opal would look. I had seen created opals before and did not care for the look. But this was a very attractive necklace,and it fulfilled the need of an opal necklace to replace a lost one."
2,name dropping 30s style,"A book of semi-amusing anecdotes, name dropping, gossip, and half-true stories.The most interesting thing about my copy is that it was printed in December 1941. (Look up Pearl Harbor, trivia fans)."
3,Psychedelic prog/folk metal treat,"Depending on how your tastes run, you will consider either ""Elegy"" or ""Tales from the Thousand Lakes"" your favorite Amorphis album. While I choose the latter by a country mile, ""Elegy"" has much to offer.This album manages to combine two often incompatible elements: ""progressiveness"" and groove. The songs are blatantly, infectiously catchy, but there is a lot going on beneath the surface. The music is not progressive in the sense of technicality, but in its subtle atmosphere, which one could very well label ""psychedelic."" Amorphis have found a great guitar tone and they exploit it for all that it is worth here.One frequent complaint against this album is that it is extremely repetitive. In fact, it sometimes sounds as if the entire album consists of variations on a single riff. This kept me from enjoying the album for a long time. For those who find that the repetition reinforces the ""groove,"" however, this fault will be irrelevant."
5,"Amorphis ""Elegy""","It feels great to hear something different, new and innovative for a change! This CD stands out bright and clear! If you like groups like Rainbow, Deep Purple and Hawkwind, you'll love this!"
1,Elegy,"Elegy is pretty bad, especially when contrasted against their previous release ""tales from a thousand lakes"" (which is a masterpiece). There are sections on this CD that are so bad I found myself laughing. The band changed their line-up and dropped the keyboard player from ""tales"" who I think made the album. You can here that the band is moving into different territory but still wants to hold onto the death metal thing. It is an extremeley awkward and not a very well thought out release from a band that was going through a major transition."
5,Flame Wagon,This wagon is built nice. The inflatable tires give it a extra cool look and make it easier to use as a garden wagon. It was easy to assemble and in my opinion is very reasonably priced.
4,Like dreaming someone else's nightmares,"These short stories are well crafted, with spare, terse sentences that strike with considerable force. Each piece begins abruptly, terminates inconclusively, and presents amazingly powerful imagery, both visual and auditory. Many of these images I would rather not have in my head. We usually know little or nothing about the characters; there are no real ""stories."" There is a dark, disconnected sensation that is close to what you feel when you are dreaming; the sense of detachment makes it feel as though you're dreaming someone else's nightmares.I can't say that I found this enjoyable; although the stories are technically interesting, the imagery is too disturbing for my tastes. Still, like the best horror films, your hands are covering your eyes at the same time that you're peeping between your fingers... Hard to keep reading, hard to stop reading."
3,a writer too enamored with style,"There are some very good stories in this collection. I liked The Neglected Garden, Teratisms and Angels in Love. These pieces have a visceral edge under the weight of the beautiful words. Koja writes in a lush, lovely, almost dreamy style but overdoes it most of the time. She writes descriptions that are so glorious I stopped several times to revel in the words. But then she will continue the description, sentence after sentence and sometimes into multiple paragraphs until you've lost the thread of what she was talking about in the first place.Some of the stories I found just plain dull, others were confusing or had a terrible ending which ruined the story. More problematic was, I felt, a lack of a coherent plot many times. Too many of the pieces ended up as empty words. Beautiful words, but empty."
4,Koja conjures the strange and the magical,"This fine collection contains sixteen examples of Koja's handiwork, including ""Arrangement for Invisible Voices"", the story of a man named Olson (a loser unable to purge the sounds of pigs being slaughtered from his memory) whose best friend is a headless Barbie Doll, and ""The Disquieting Muse"", a disturbing tale in which a psychologist becomes obsessed with a particularly unsavory patient. These stories reveal Koja's extraordinary ability to conjure the strange and the magical, the bizarre and the fantastic. Constantly shifting between tenderness and violence, the fantastic and the ordinary, these dreamlike, surreal riffs will linger in your mind for days after you finish."
1,"Overwritten ""High Brow"" Emptiness","I've noticed that there are basically two types of horror fiction: stories with easily-readable prose that are mostly concerned with telling the story (Bentley Little, Richard Laymon, Dean Koontz) and stories--mostly written by women, who knows why--that require a lot of effort to decipher due to their so-called literary merits. This collection falls into the latter category. If you stripped each tale down to its basic story elements, you'd be left with almost nothing. Reading these stories was, for me, like doing hard, sweaty labor for minimum wage--it just ain't worth it! I honestly have to wonder how many people read this stuff for enjoyment and how many read it to be part of some ""scene"". I read all categories of fiction, not just horror, but I can always count on the horror field to produce some of the best examples of awful, overwritten prose. This collection may just be the finest example yet."
5,Comprehensive studies,"Although I take exception with labeling bachelors under 45 as ""pre-married"", is objectively well researched and written work. Despite the religious not-so-right and others' condemnation of increased singles and divorce, most would agree that remaining single has always been the appropriate lifestyle for many people."
5,Powerful Memoir,This is a must read for any high school or middle schooler learning about the Holocaust. Hannelore is a strong young woman who survives against all odds. I had a hard time putting it down until the end.
4,Powerful Memoir,"""I Will Plant You a Lilac Tree"" is a memoir of a Holocaust survivor who had some extremely trying times. It amazed me that Hannelore Wolfe, the main character, was so brave after all she went through. She was sent to multiple labor camps and each time they got more gruesome. The first half of the book I thoroughly enjoyed reading. But, the second half got somewhat repetitive, so I had a hard time focusing on the book. I found myself to be a little bored as I got farther into the book. Not because Hannelore's troubles were boring, but because everything that happened seemed to be similar. It's mildly depressing at points and, I felt, hard to get in the mood to read it. Although, overall, I learned many things that I didn't know before reading it and would recommend it to readers interested in the Holocaust!"
2,Didn't know that this was a book for young children,"I had read this book after checking it out at the library and loved it. I was eager to share it with others but when I received the book, it seemed very small. I read the inside flap and saw that it was a book for young readers. No mention was made when I purchased it as to what kind of book it was. Otherwise I loved the grown-up version from the library."
5,Awesome!,This book is great! I have always been interested in this subject and i don't normaly read books! I'm a junior in high school and i enjoyed this book ALOT!!! Great character plot and great ending!! I don't want to return it to the library!! Also i share the same last name!
2,REALLY BORING,"Ok, so here is what happens. This stupid chick DECIDES to go to a concentration camp with her family. Then the rest of the story is just some stupid love story. Still a better love story than Twilight."
4,A capturing account from terrible times,"I will plant you a lilac tree is a beautiful true story that is set in the Holocaust. It tells of a girl, a survivor of over 5 concentration camps, and her struggle to have faith. It is emotional and beautiful and the story captures one from the first page. It tells of the horrors of the camps, and how people survived. But importantly it is a true story of love where it seems like love can not be found. Hannelore Wolff meets Dick Hillman and together they suffer each other's sufferings and live each other's lives for one another."
3,Exit-13 - Ethos Musick (NEW in protective plastic),"Product arrived as described - new in packaging and unopened, everything in order and very quickly. Only one small point of interest being that the back cover in the jewel case had a hole punched in it on the bottom left corner, seemingly done with a hole punch. I found it quite odd that it arrived complete with what seemed to be factory damage, imperfect if you will.Apart from that issue which I could seriously have done without, product was as described and delivered in a prompt manner."
3,Danby wine cooler - its a little noisey,"The unit cools fine. Wine bottles fit in it ok and the price was at the low end for wine coolers. I had read reviews that complained of its noise. I figured I didn't need to worry about the noise issue as I was installing it under a counter, behind a bar, with the back of the unit vented into my garage. I was wrong it makes a very low pitched hum that though low in tone is fairly loud. I sealed around the unit to prevent air from entering into the house from the garage. This sealing did nothing to releave the noise. The good news is its cycled off more than its on so the noise isn't constant. Its in our family room and if the TV is on or music is playing its noise fades into the background. The real question is knowing what I know now would I still have purchased the unit? Right now yes. I've gotten used to the noise. If you had asked me in the first two months I had the unit I would have said no way."
1,Junk,"The thermostat on this model is very imprecise. Even if you get the temperature where you'd like it (good luck with that), it's only temporary - it will eventually shift to below 50 or above 60. I should have done some research before buying this junky thing."
2,Guess you get what you pay for,"This is a very cute picture but I am afraid the actual product is not as nice as shown here. The workmanship just is not up to par with the rest of my collection. This is a shame as she could be quite cute. I love her character, but not this particular piece. As always, be aware that these are not children's toys. These are toys for big girls and boys and are not appropriate for children. The cost of this one is pretty low, so I suppose I got what I paid for so I should not complain so much."
4,Felo 0715752227 Multi Bit Screwdriver,"I have always enjoyed the convenience of having a multi-bit screwdriver handy at all times, but have always been frustrated by the quality of them. This one is the best I have found to date. I can really torque down on this one and have yet to strip the shaft from the handle. That may sound strange, but it's common with some of the ordinary hardware and chain store variety versions. Also, there is VERY little play between the bit and the bit holder, and virtually none between the bit holder and the handle. Simply a pleasure to use."
4,"Slanting conservative, but thoughtful nonetheless","http://www.mypatriotact.com/?page_id=7Eland is Director of the Center on Peace and Liberty at the Independent Institute in California. Though his political philosophy differs significantly from mine, this book provides sound arguments against American imperialism that he manages to justify from both sides of American party politics. The general thrust of his writing is similar to Chalmers Johnson's (in fact, he references Johnson frequently), though the book focuses less on militarism and the loss of freedom and more on the general - and frighteningly, now commonly accepted - idea of an American Empire. A must-read for anyone looking for justification to forge a strong political movement for the dismantling of our empire."
2,"Informative, but very boring","This book was in no sense biased. Every fact in this book was well researched. But after reading one chapter in the book, I fell asleep. Sometimes, I spent sometime trying to understand the similes and metaphors throughout the book. Overall, I would recommend the book for research, but not for casual reading."
1,Stunningly Clueless,"This book is a mind-numbing set of specious one-sided arguments slamming American history and values. The author seems to inhabit his own little world, where every historical ""empire"" no matter how complex, illustrates a few simple notions of the evil of getting involved with the larger world. The talking points are discussed and concluded with the glib tone of a high-school debating club. The author's view of history is extravagantly revisionist, and often self-contradictory. He seems hopelessly confused by world politics, and just wishes we could withdraw behind a wall, secure in our smug superiority. He has nothing at all intelligent to say about Islamic terrorism, rogue nuclear states, or the impending bankruptcy of the western social democracies, caused by an inward-looking worldview that agrees with his own."
2,Poor,"The author has certainly convinced himself that in the 21st century the U.S. should think of itself as a plaintive island. I think that always in politics and governance the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Alas, this book - scholarly, heavily researched - is so stiffly one-sided that it almost impressed me as a meticulous work of mad fantasy. It is too lucid to count as manifesto but too bloodless and bland to register a real sense of thoughtfulness."
3,Good Idea,"Some of the points are very well researched and discussed but then the author becomes a litte extreme by suggesting we should not bother to get involved with any world crisis unless it impacts us directly. Well, even though the idea is noble, the consequences are morally wrong. US can do many harm to the world but it also brought so many good things to the world that we need certain level of involvment,"
3,Not all samples come with books compile.,"I think the book needs a little bit re-organizing. Some references to code appear chapters later. And worst thing is, the first sample I tried to compile, failed. It is the chapters/19/12/1.2"
3,Simply just go for O'reilly,"I have 3 Swing books in my private library and what I can say is that still O'reilly is the clearest and the perfect book for those that are willing to really KNOW Swing. David Geary's book in my opinion has interesting tips (specially on about paintComponent,validate etc...) but is very badly organized and has too many methods refenreces rather than explaning what that method does (JSDK online api doc is there already)."
2,From Elba to St. Helena,"A melodramatic rendering of the final days of Napoleon's rule. The English author, Stephen Coote, plows ground already fully developed by many first-rate historians. He seems to keep accurately to the basic plot line, while lending his own often over-wrought descriptive take to whatever matter is at hand. Not a bad book for an airline flight, but not a top-flight history."
4,"Product Good, but Amazon shipping cost too much","The product was as expected, but Amazon charged almost as much to ship it as it cost. Will stay away from buying small ticket items from Amazon."
1,I'm sorry I spent money on this!,The author is more concerned with the cute little rhyme than in being true to the story. Poor quality printing leaves the colours smeared. Very bad value...
5,It's all right there,This book is small but it revealing. It reminds me in its quiet tone of Rosemary Wells' books 'To The Bunny Planet'. We've all watched cats but not this carefully. The artwork is engaging and the language direct. It will make you better at looking at everything. It is a great book to use as a springboard for your own writing. I think it is as appropriate for adults as it is for children.
1,A Waste of Money & Ink,"Although this book describes itself as ""the ultimate cat book"", it is just a simple poem with childish illustrations. The best lines are the ones excerpted in the editorial review - the rest was disappointing. I suspect that the other reviewer is a friend of the author. It would be kind of cute for [$] but at [$] it's way overpriced."
4,book,"Perilous times is an in depth review of the repression of free speech and assembly and political affiliation from unmasking Lincolns assumed good intentions, the debauchery of the cold war and Mccarthy era until the consolidation of views by the media today. Dense read, wouldn't recommend for pleasure. Had to read this for a political dissent class in college. What makes a review helpful by the way? Interesting subject matter, wasn't all bad but was not a fun read- bottom line. Haters are not welcome on my page."
4,A great assesment,"This book tells the first amendment in times of crises. And what one learns is that the first amendment has often been violated beginning with the Sedition acts and then up through the `loyalty oaths' and the imprisonment of Debs and even into today. But what this book also does is give us hope, showing that actually everytime rights were taken away they were given back when the situation ended. The end of World War one brought Debs from prison. The end of Mcarthyism brought down the obsession with `red baiting'. America has been resilient to tyranny longer then any democracy in history. Even with the Civil war and the suspension of Habeas Corpus, rights returned, eventually to the South in 1877. This is America and this book is a great testament to our moderation.Seth J. Frantzman"
2,Too much espionage for my taste,"I enjoyed the mystery of it all, but it was a little too much of a spy/Communist plot for my tastes. I prefer murder mysteries over espionage in the majority of cases. I did like the satisfying ending, though."
3,Life: It truly is worth living.,"Featuring neither of her quintessential sleuths, Hercules Poirot and Miss Marple, this book is a case of missing persons, double identity, and murder.Contemplating suicide, Hilary Craven, is immersed into life full of excitement and the unknown. Life: It truly is worth living.Given Mrs. Christie's attitude toward disloyal men throughout the book, I would say that her previous marriage and the feelings and emotions experienced during that time of her life greatly effected the writing of this book.This is a fun story with lots of plot twists throughout. I rate it three stars out of five on the following scale:+ poor read++ so-so read+++ good read++++ excellent read+++++ life changing read"
1,The Collected Broadcasts of Garbage,Don't waste your time or money on this CD. It isn't worth a dime. It doesn't have a single authentic broadcast made by Idi Amin...just some guy's rantings in an enunciation not even remotely like Amin's. This guy sounds like a limp Calypsonian. This CD is not humorous and has nothing whatsoever to do with the real Idi Amin. Take it from a real Ugandan.
3,"Works, but flimsy casing.","Installed this cable at the outlaw's place from DVD player to reciever. Worked fine for a while, but has recently failed due to a bit of rough handling. Granted a person should be carefull with optical cables, but the casing on this cable is very soft and does not do much to preserve the fiber in the case of an accidental sharp bend."
3,"A Music Fan from Hamilton,Ont.Canada","Elvis' as always gave his all in his singing and his preformance. But the magic of his southern soul was missing, and this album although very good shows it."
3,sound could be better,"I have to agree with David Kenner of Fort Worth when he argues that the sound on this cd is not what it should be. When my wife bought this cd for me, I was initially excited only to be brokenhearted when I listened to ""Kentucky Rain."" The vinyl version of this song is superior. How often do you hear that vinyl sound is better than cd? On the cd version, background voices and instruments, especially the excellent horns, are almost nonexistent. The scariest thing about this is that it will make me hesitant to buy remastered Elvis cds in the future. My vinyl is in too good of a shape to be throwing good money away on bad remastering."
4,Great for VB bufffs,"Jim and Taras use alot of pictures in this book. Its very basic in its explanations, a great beginners book. It also gives a glimpse into how much volleyball has changed in the last 2 decades. While written and printed a while ago, the subject matter is still relevant."
5,Great for kids 18+ months,"This toy keeps my kids entertained for hours! I bought extra pieces like the mom and baby and the boy with the dog to make it more interesting. Pieces are small and tend to get lost, so it is good to keep it contained when not in use."
3,what happend?,"when this movie was originally released in theatres it was rated PG-13. this is the PG version, with not only some of the more crude parts removed, it now has musical numbers in it! not recommended for the casual moviegoer."
1,The bathtub scene is just too weird.,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but not only because it was so boring. There are a few scenes that are really... unsettling. One in particular is when the protagonist kid is being given a bath; the lighting, the snickering, the unnerving playfullness, and the fact that a creepy old man comes in on the scene all make for a totally icky vibe. Grossed me out for all the wrong reasons. Straight up terrible."
3,Purely sentimental,"I regret buying this dvd. I regret actually spending money on something I loved as a kid, but as an adult I can see how truly bad this movie is. For sentimental reasons I might keep it, but I don't ever feel the need to watch it. I would've been better off just renting it."
1,The Garbage Fail Kids,This is just as bad as Batman & Robin.It has zero redeeming factors whatsoever.The puppetry is garbage at best with the way their lips don't move right.The Love storyline between Dodger & Tangerine is just as bad and gross as the rest of the film.The State Home For The Ugly subplot should have never happen in the first place ever.The musical number is dreadful and more painful then getting a root canal.This movie was just gross for sake for gloss. I give this [bleep] a 0 out of 10.
2,when i was a kid this was awesome but now....,"i keep buying shows and cartoons I used to be obsessed with when I was a little kid and usually get disappointed, The Garbage Pail kids Movie was not a exception, maybe I should go buy the cartoon series.... or maybe I shouldn't lol"
4,New family addition,"OK this was for my son who said he remembered it from when he was young, when we received it he realized how far the world has come with graphics, so if your just looking for something out of your childhood, go for it."
4,pleased,I love the the garage pail kids and I was glad that I was able to purchase this product at a reasonable price
3,B Movies,"Blast from the past ..If you love cheesy you will love this , If you love 80's you will love this , IF you were a GPK card collector as I was .. you will love this . IT's gross it's silly it's nostalgic"
1,Oldy & moldy.,"Only watch for nostalgic reasons, do not expect a quality film. Take a pass on this and find a better movie from the 80's to share with your kids."
4,Ugly...I'll Show You Ugly,"This is pretty much a bare bones release of the original movie on DVD. There is no booklet and as a previous reviewer mentioned the only extra is a trailer. There could have been at least a featurette or something about the history of the cards or a little behind the scenes movie or something, but heck I guess you get the movie. Like others, this movie holds a special place in my heart. My aunt felt it was too damn gross and took it away from me, my only VHS copy in 1988 I believe and as I got older I asked her for it back and she couldn't find it, so now I finally have my movie back. My favorite line is, ""Ugly, I'll Show you Ugly,"" and I think one of the kids starts vomitting or something vile...it's a nasty lil flick but I like it."
4,Nostalgia,"This movie holds nostalgic value for me personally. So, there is no possible way for me to put it down. I grew up watching this. Awesome for what it is and should never be seriously critisized..."
1,GARBAGE PAIL KIDS MOVIE Review,"Toilet humor and cheesy musical scores are aplenty in this movie based on the old collector's stickers that were so popular in the 80's. This is absolutely one of the dumbest movies ever put on film. It does occasionally have moments that are so bad that they are funny but for the most part, it is not worth sitting through some very annoying characters for a few moments that will provide a forgettable chuckle or two.Okay, for the sake of anyone who is really interested, a bullied kid somehow releases the nasty title characters on his unsuspecting tormentors with predictable results. You're better off checking out the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie if you're feeling nostalgic."
4,the Garbage Pail Kids Movie Rocks! \m/,"This movie is quite good considering what is; A low budget gross-out kid's movie from the eighties. Iv'e heard a lot of talk that the movie isn't that good. Also, judging by how short it was in the theatre it wasnt that popular either. Desipite this criticism it's a unique movie. This is a plus in this age of cookie-cutter holywood filtered/politically correct movies."
1,Taking out the Garbage,"""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"" is based on the immensely popular and offensive Cabbage Patch Kids parodies. In the '80s,the Garbage Pail Kids had the forbidden fruit appeal. Parents hated them--kids,of course,collected and enjoyed them. So,they decided to turn a trading card game INTO A MOVIE (this has taken a post-modern form withYu-Gi-Oh! Grand Championship Season 5 Set) The Kids will make you literally nauseated,they're that repellent. The lead is played by Mackenzie Astin,whose famous brother Sean,has starred in a far better fantasy series. ""Garbage Pail Kids"" will make you lose your popcorn. It's that bad. Avoid it for the kids. Avoid it for the future."
3,Yeah I bought the Garbage Pail Kids Movie,If I hadn't seen the movie as a kid I wouldn't have bought it now. The quality is good for a movie most people would like to forget. I enjoyed watching it again but I only wish there was some extras like commentary track explaining why this movie was made. The movie is a true cult classic that no one will admit to watching or even liking. :D
3,just a movie,"got this for grand daughter, she loved it..she like garbage pail cards and wanted this movie,you can tell this is an old movie tho...but it was ok"
5,Stay in the haunted mansion,Only the 1980s could produce a crazy movie like this. Freaking ridiculous and awesome. I still have my garbage pail kid cards and I plan on willing them to my granchildren. Before they get them though they will have to survive a night in a haunted mansion with a ghost tiger. I ain't makin' it easy to get my GPK cards!
1,Don't waste your money,The material is out-of-date. This book only talked about a little bit about everything on foreclosure. don't waste your money.
1,"Vague, outdated info","This book reminds me of the joke ""How to Make a Million Dollars and Never Pay Taxes"". Step 1: First you get a million dollars.All the info was about that useful."
2,Some good ideas but not enough questions answered,"While the writer has some good ideas on putting together a process on buying foreclosures, he does not answer many of the crucial questions someone new to the field has. 1) How clean is the title when delivered by a foreclosing bank? 2) How to conduct a reliable appraisal. (he spends 1-2 pages on the in the whole book)Good ideas but there have got to be better books that answer the important questions."
2,YOU'LL LEARN SOMETHING BUT NOT ENOUGH TO START,"CERTAIN SECTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN MORE CLEARLY. THE SERIES OF EVENTS LEADING TO A FORECLOSURE WAS DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW.AFTER READING THE BOOK, I STILL DIDN'T GET A CLEAR IDEA HOW CLEAN THE TITLE WILL BE AT EACH STAGES OF THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS.THE BOOK MENTIONED THAT CERTAIN STATES USE DEEDS WHILE OTHERS USE MORTGAGES. BUT IT DIDN'T TELL YOU WHAT YOUR STATE FALLS INTO THUS WHICH PROCEDURE TO FOLLOW NEXT.IF YOU FOLLOW HIS METHODS FOR SEARCHING OUT THE PROPERTIES, YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO DO THIS ON A FULL TIME BASES. AT CERTAIN STEPS, I'LL RATHER PAY FOR CERTAIN SERVICES TO SIMPLIFY THINGS.THE BOOK DOES HAVE MANY USEFUL TECHNIQUES ESPECIALLY ON PERSON TO PERSON CONTACT AND NEGOTIATION SKILLS."
1,Not relevant -not worth your money,"Frankly put, the information and examples contained in this book were probably relevant in 1999 when the book was published, but after 2000 many of the examples and principles became irrelevant in our changing economic world. Real estate became the sexy investment of choice, new types of mortgage products became available and owners and renters alike became much more sophisticated. The author talks about buying houses for $36,000!!! Perhaps in the early 1980's, but not anymore--especially not in California which is where most of his real estate dealmaking took place.Save your money and purchase another real estate book on pre-foreclosure prospecting, or the financials of property ownership. It will be money well spent."
1,is it me or is it the shoes?,"I'm a size 11 but the seller claims the shoes run big so I had to order a half-size smaller. I did get the 10.5 and I love the look and feel of the shoes when I put them on. However as soon as I start walking, the heel part keeps slipping off and I feel pinches all over. I can't even walk in these shoes! Is it the size then? Are the shoes too narrow for me? I would like to return them but I've since lost the box. I threw it away together with the invoice/receipt on the first day and didn't really try them on till about a month later. My stupid mistake."
1,I have yet to receive this item,"I have been waiting for this item to come in, but it hasn't come in yet. Unfortunately, as there is no tracking information given, I have no idea if it's even coming. So, I don't have a good review yet. Sorry"
1,Poor instructions for each pattern.,"The patterns in this book are written very poorly, even for an experienced knitter like myself, I found myself having to re-read the directions over and over again. I'm completely disappointed with this book - it is already in the give away box."
5,Superb,This is a wonderful DVD for a person who loves and enjoys music. The person I bought this for thoroughly enjoyed.
5,DVD..excellent,I bought this DVD several months ago. Well done.Has great sounding sound tracks.The DVD is much more enjoyable than the cd.Great product.
5,Please rerelease this title!,"This film is marvelous in every way, very well written, acted, photographed, just excellent. However, it is completely impossible to find a copy of it!!!! Does anyone know where it can be bought?"
3,Nice but too big.,"I ordered these earrings as a gift, but in person, they are too big. Make sure you check the size before you order. Otherwise, they are nice and sparkly."
3,Didn't like this book very much.,"There was more to do than I would like for something that claims to be a fix-it, forget it book. The recipes were not all that interesting."
4,Great book,Lots of great recipes that are good for you and your family. New recipes not in the original fix it and forget it.
1,Don't get this book- waste of money!,I can't tell you enough how bad these recipes were. And like the other reviewers was excited to get this cookbook so we'd stop eating on the go so much.I started trying a new recipe such as the chilli and it was awful! Most of the recipes were bland or mushy.
3,Fix it and Forget it Lightly,"The recipes are very easy, but they're also a little bland and boring. I'd like to see more pizzazz and flavor. The recipes are great for quick, let's see what I have in the cupboard days when you just need to try to use what you have. But if you're looking for more excitement in the kitchen, this may not be it."
3,"Recipes need ""fixing""","I like the principle of slow cooking: a low-maintenance and cost-effective way to cook. But I've made a couple of the recipes in this book and as other reviewers have said, they are kind of bland, boring, and watery. And the prep of chopping lots of veggies (for some recipes) to get started may be easy but takes a LOT of time! It's been very disappointing to make the time and get it all set up only to have a dismal result at the end of the day when you're hungry."
2,Dissapointed in how few really long cooking recipes are in this book,"My thoughts in getting this book were things I could put in the crockpot before leaving for work in the morning and eat when we all got home that evening. If that's what you're looking for, this book isn't for you. Very few recipes in the book cook longer then 4-5 hours. If you work parttime, maybe they work or if you're cooking for the weekend, it probably works.They should change the title to Fix-it and Forget-it for a FEW hours."
5,The cookbook I ordered was in extremely good condition.,I ordered Fix-It & Forget It; Healthy Low-Fat Recipes for your Slow Cooker. The condition is great and it was listed as slightly used. I would highly recommend.
3,Same old recipes,I expected more original recipes. These are recipes I could have gotten from any cookbook.
3,"Packed with Recipes, but you have to use some common sense","Some of the recipes in this book are wonderful and others, not so much."
2,too much of the usual,I bought this as it was the only crockpot cooking book at the bookstore. I read it and most of the recipes are just lighter versions of the old casseroles using too many prepared soups like light cream of mushroon soup and spices like light sodium seasoned salt. There were only a few recipes I even wanted to try..I like to cook and would be wiiling to come back and check ingredients and stir things and so forth during the day but did not want to be tied to the stove and maybe burn things. The ingredients rarely had extra spices and wine and etc. I'm too much of a foodie for this one...leave it for the church suppers in the midwest.
5,My Most-Used Cookbook,"This is the cookbook that never stays on the kitchen shelf for long. With so many varieties of each main ingredient, we never get tired of anything. The recipes make great use of my spice collection and give me combinations I would never think of on my own. This is my favorite healthy cookbook because it does not have many fish and seafood recipes (though there are some). I have tried and tried, but just cannot turn myself into a fish eater and most healthy cookbooks I try are filled with fish dishes! It has a great assortment of old favorites, such as chicken and dumplings, as well as newer selections, even a few including meat substitutes.Tip: If you are trying meat substitutes (eg. tofu, TVP) for the first time, or your family is hesitant to try them, then slow-cooking is the way to go because the flavors of vegetables and seasonings will really seep into the protein. Sometimes, kids don't even realize they're eating TVP instead of ground beef!"
1,Did they even test these recipes first?,"I have a family of five with busy schedules of sports, scouts, church activities, etc., etc. I was excited to get this cookbook so we'd stop eating on the go so much. Sound familiar?I started trying a new recipe week after week. Every recipe was awful! Most of the recipes were bland or mushy. Which reminds me...Beware of any of the recipes that call for rice. It will be overcooked. I guess I should have known that, but yuck! Just in case you're like me and didn't know: Rice turns to mush in a crockpot!I hate to bad mouth this book so bad, but I wasted money buying the book and money buying the food for the recipes that I just ended up throwing out....several times. I tried mostly shrimp or chicken recipes.Maybe I chose the wrong recipes? But after a couple of months, you would think I'd hit a winner."
2,"A few winners, but mostly boring and flavorless","I really wish this book had reviews written IN THE BOOK. Because...some of the recipes are really quite good and flavorful, but most, like 75% or more, are really boring. I enjoy the Mexican Cornbread, the Tastes-like-Chile-Rellenos, the Coq au Vin, the Steak Fajitas; but mostly, I'm adding in the salt and fat that they tried to take out since it would be too boring otherwise. There are just not enough other flavors to make up for the lack of salt and fat.In addition, I think the format of the book is less than helpful; it has pages and pages of beef stews for instance, all with basically the same ingredients with only minor differences between them all. And, there are no comments to guide you in choosing which one would taste best. I have almost stopped trying new recipes from this book since I am usually disappointed."
2,Don't get your hopes up,"I was excited to find a crockpot cookbook that didn't have lots of recipes with cream of mushroom soup in them. Some recipes are written more clearly than others. Some have a range for how long you should cook stuff instead of a particular number.I tried 3 recipes. First was a Rosemary Chicken recipe which cooked the chicken too long and dried it out. Then I tried a macaroni and cheese recipe which burnt. Finally I tried a recipe for chicken with soy sauce and honey which once again was dried out. The seasonings were good and some of the recipes were pretty unique, hence the 2 star rating.I followed the directions to the letter and even had the same size crockpot which they mentioned in the recipe!So if you choose to use this book, watch the food VERY CLOSELY."
3,Fix it and forget it ~ lightly,"I have Fix It And Forget It, and now Fix It and Forget It Lightly. Not much difference between the two, and honestly, not much variety in recipes. If you have one, you do not need the other."
4,"Fix-It and Forget-It Lightly; Healthy, Low-Fat Recipes for Your Slow Cooker",This is an easy to use recipe book. There are varied recipes with easy-to-follow directions and relatively economical ingrediants. None of the recipes I've tried has taken long to put together.
2,You'll find better online,"I love to cook healthy meals and was excited to get this (per my request) for Christmas. I was very, very disappointed in the recipes. These meals maybe considered low-fat, but the ingrediants are less to be desired. Fat-free is not good for you and I think I was looking for a more ""clean"" approach to meals. I tried one of the recipes and it was AWFUL. My husband and I choked it down. You can find better stuff online. Save your $$ or buy mine!"
3,Lots of Recipes,"There are definitely a lot of recipes to try in here, but as a Weight Watchers member, these weren't as low as I had hoped. The recipes I have tried so far have been tasty."
5,Cooking Lightly and Cooking Delicious (and cheap),"A cookbook that is not only practical, easy to follow but allows you to prepare a 'gourmet' meal with ingredients usually found in your pantry, cupboard and refrigerator. Highly recommended by a working 'girl' with a husband who has come to expect good food from a wife who loves to cook, but doesn't have time to do to many 'from scratch' fine dinners any more. The biggest plus about the meals featured herein is the low-calorie, low-fat, healthy aspect! And still tasty! (and affordable!) She has it all in one great cookbook!"
4,I loved this book,"I ordered this book for a Christmas present. My friend liked it. It was in very good condition, and has helped her to make delicious dishes in the crockpot. It arrived within the time expected."
2,For this price I expected more,"The design of this frame is beautiful. Simple, classic and elegant. Unfortunately the two I ordered were not in pristine condition. The glass contained slight imperfections that were impossible to remove. The frames bore smudges and small scratches. Lastly the inside of the frame is larger than 5 x 7 and lacks any kind of inner guides for placing the photo, so you just have to eyeball it and hope it doesn't shift while you slide all the pieces and backing into place. I was wearing cotton gloves to protect the very expensive photo prints that I was putting into these frames, so I'm confident that the frames shipped with all those scratches and smudges. I really expected a much nicer finished product from Reed & Barton. And since when is Reed & Barton made in China?"
3,Side effects,"I was taking one capsule a day for 3 days and unfortunately experienced nausea, headaches and diarrhea. Sopped taking it. Then a week later decided to take one more capsule .... Had nausea, headache, bloating and diarrhea. That was my last try. It's really sad I cannot handle this supplement, my body rejects it. I wish luck for other people taking this product."
4,Supplement,"This came in a timely fashion and is more product than I realized at first, but that is only beneficial."
2,If you want a tape to listen to while driving this isn't it!,"I was looking for lessons on audio that I could use to practise Italian while driving. This audio falls way short of my expectations. There are no English explanations on the tape, so you have no idea what is being said. The tape is useless on it's own, you need to be looking at the book. The book is not well organized. I'm plodding through it but I find the approach somewhat irritating at times. I'm still searching for a good audio."
4,A Mind Given Over to Obsession,A staid German author is suddenly inspired through the sight of a stranger to travel and selects Venice as his destination. Once he is there he becomes obsessed with a young boy he spies on the beach and begins stalking him as the city is being stalked by cholera. This is a taut psychological examination of obsession and the uncharacteristic behavior a person can be driven to under it's influence.
1,Easily One Of The Worst Hip-Hop Artist Ever,"It's not even about him saying his name over, Mikes Jones cannot rap period. I have no idea how this man got a record deal I have no idea how some of these other rappers got record deals but whoever is signing these fools need to stop and listen a little bit longer before they sign idiots like Mike Jones. The man cant even talk properly plus his mouth is a disaster. Why do people think Mike Jones is hot? I dont understand what Mikes Jones is putting out that grabs people attention. He is not creative and his lyrics are about as basic as Hooked On Phonics which is something he really need to take advantage of. Mikes Jones is not just an embarrassment to Hip-Hop but an embarrassment to himself. When I see Mike Jones & The Ying Yang Twins tossing money around on television it tells me that here in America anything is possible."
3,I Know Who Mike Jones is after this album?,I thought almost all the beats were hard as hell too bad the rapper couldn't deliver theres a few songs that are good. Also its gets really tiring hearing him announce his name at the beginning of every song like I'm gon forget whose album I'm listening to. If you like Still Tipping you will probably like the album.
2,Flashes of brilliance....but mostly crap.,"Mike Jones! WHO? Mike Jones!....this gets kinda boring after a while, doesn't it? In any event, Mike Jones does have flashes of a decent rapper (well, at least in this watered-down era of garbage that we dare call rap) but sadly this album just ends up being a mixture of decent beats, repetitive and mostly meaningless lyrics and just overall blandness. The only reason why I decided to give this 2 stars is because Still Tippin' and Flossin' (Listen to Big Moe ""sing"" and tell me you don't laugh!). If there are some songs on here that you like, just burn them onto a CD or find them for your IPOD or whatever. Spend your hard earned money and go by a Z-Ro or Scarface CD; they are far more worthy of your time and money."
1,Who is Mike Jones? A talentless idiot that's who,"This disasterpiece is by far one of the worst albums of 2005. The only good song on here is ""Still Tippin"". The rest is just a disaster from start to finish. The songs are stupid, the rapping is awful, the writing is abysmal, lots of gimmicks, and the beats sound like they were created by a 5 year old. Not to mention this idiot talks about his name and phone number in every line. I hope this gimmick rapper a long with other bad dirty south acts such as Paul Wall, D4L, and The Yin Yang Twins will be history by next year."
2,Window Dressing,"Just like the new cable ""reality"" show that you can't wait to see, Mike Jones is the recipient of excellent marketing. Unfortunately, the content of this album is similar to 80% of those shows - mostly hype.After te first run-throw of the cd I was less in awe of his lyrical ability than I was with his ability to say his name so many times in one song. At last count he'd reached 9-times on one song. I suppose that takes skill.Mostly I was left disappointed. If you have to talk about yourself that much, then you definately don't have anything to talk about. I will give him credit for catchy hooks, good production and simple grimy lyrics. There are those that are content with a nice beat and catchy hook....just not me."
1,About as stupid as this name.,"This is truly awful and dead in the water disasterpiece that will surely be on my list of the year's worst album, terrible songs (with the exception of Still Tippin), terrible rapping and his repeating is so idiotic, it's a crime and I'm more convinced that this rapper, MC Hammer, Young Black Teenagers, Vanilla Ice, Fred Durst and the whole nu metal movement, bad dirty south rap, Chingy and especially 5-0 & G-Unit should be destroyed and never be seeing again.This album is garbage, I Really Despise this album.* Star."
1,Mike jones makes ja-rule look talented...,"Whats hip-hop coming to ? When the only thing you can enjoy,is an idiot saying his name over and over again...Didn't we had fabolous spelling his name on every song already ? Even fake thugs such as,50 & ja sounds way better then this and im some one who does not like g unit at all. Well, Who is Mike jones by mike jones is pathetic and the production is awfull... Save hip-hop and dont support gay unit, dike jonez and anything that you see on mtv. Support underground hip-hop."
3,How bad?,"How bad is it, How good is it? I couldn't say either, I've heard and own worse, but yet at the same time honor better... You HAVE to admit who HASN'T heard of Mike Jones? Who else can make so many people remember him like that, or hate hime, or even love him? I mean come on, he's got something there, and I kinda like his style, I'm stuck on oddball sh*t... And I'll admit back then sticks in my head, and isn't some music supposed to do that so you kinda HAVE to hear it again or it just annoys you?"
1,This is the reason why metals hate rap,"(sigh) i really wanna cry right now but i m a dude so i'll just tell u my review.mike jones is terrible just plain awful.paul wall is not that far behind.he thinks he is eminem.that wigga isn't even close.slim thug is probably the best person on the album (even though he has bad competition). i'd buy his album but never paul wall (what type of name is that?),or mike jones all he does is repeat and repeat and repeat his cell # and his gay ass name. i could go into more detail of how this sucks but i want to live my life fully (even though i bought this album)"
2,Repeats himself too many times.,"Not impressed by this cd except for still tippin. He repeats himself to much. He keeps saying his name in each track, and he keeps saying his phone number. I only reason I bought is because I thought it was pall wall's cd. But i was mistaken. Still tippin is fat though. We know your name. He must of said over 100 times, his phone number too. Get some real material man.Tonyholiday, fl"
3,I will my 2 cents in,Well they picked the type of songs. They went to the Chingy type songs rather then the Goodie Mob or UGK whatever music they should have. The production is clear and crisp and is pretty good for the material that they had to produce.His lyrics are average but with better material he could have better one. He has nice technique and has a good flow.This CD has it's moments but he needs better material.Lyrics 6.5 Production 8.5 X Factor 5.5 Replay 4.0
3,So much potential wasted...,"Mike Jones spends way too much time repeating his name and his cell phone number on nearly every song on his album. It's quite irrating to listen to that constantly. Still Tippin' is an excellent song, mainly because of Slim Thug and Paul Wall. If he spends more of his time perfecting his lyrcial skills, this album could been a lot better. It's such a shame because he has so much potential to become a good rap artist."
1,DO yoself a favor and listen to REAL hip hop with substance,"People need to stop getting brainwashed by the garbage thats out there, theres been a southern explosion, and i think the only southern rappers that keep it real, are scarface, UGK, outkast, and 3 6 mafia, anything else is garbage, Gives a F bout how much cashflow u got, the percentage of southern rappers that can flow is less than 5 percent. Theres a lotta good hip hop out there, that people need to pay attention to, like Nas, Common, Mos Def, Tribe called quest, de la soul, Paris, Gangstarr, and marley marl and Premiere are the best producers in hip hop Ever end of discussion, Boogie down productions! Afrika bambaata, Ultramagnetic MC's, Jeru da damaja, wu tang of course, and if u donnno any of these u aint hip hop, and if u disrespect any of these u aint hip hop, peace"
2,who is mike jones? an idoit,"mike jones' new albums sounds like a big hit. good tracks are Still Tri ppin and , Back Then. that before I hear all of cd. its sucks. Whoever sign mike jones to clother line and shoe deal is crazy ,its not going to sell.Who Is Mike Jones?bad repeating rapper. sorry mike but you suck 2 out of 5."
1,Wow!,"Oh man! Oh man! This CD is amazing! (...)Pink Floyd and Guns n' Roses, Mike Jones is gonna change the world!If you took any of that seriously, this album is for you."
4,4 Stars,Alot of peeps hate on this probably because he brags a bit too much but what rapper thats well known and mainstream doesnt the only problem i have with this album is he repeats himself alot in different songs you'll hear the same line from like 3 or 4 different tracks but I still can let this cd roll when i put it in but if you dont like bragging this isnt the cd for you but if you can look beyond that you can find that he does have some skill in there
1,Who?,"Who is right. I cannot believe that THIS guy, who has NO CLUE how to rap, has a platinum album.But then again, so does The Game, 50 Cent, Eminem, Slim Thug, Paul Wall, Lloyd Banks, and all the other talentless garbage littering the mainstream.The only thing Mike Jones albums are good for is smashing, and burning. And please, for previous reviewers who rated this above a 1...don't say ""yallz hatin on teh mik jon3z cuz he b rich an youz b po."" Mike Jones is a Southern-fried retard, and any woman that'd want him is nothing more than money-hungry hoe. Which is why I guess he refers to ALL women as hoes.I bet he even calls his mama a hoe.Don't pick this up, please."
4,mike jones...who mike jones!,Mike jones really set it of on those hoes...thats what i like about him.cop this album for real for real!
5,Mike Mike Mike Jones,"I was raised by a billy goat who went by the name Kevin. He wasnt much of a caretaker, but he did teach me two valueable things that got me to where i am today. He taught me how to make love to a woman and he taught me that fame isnt acheieved through good looks. This is when I ran into Mike Jones, the most hideous black man Ive ever seen. Once he dropped a bar though I knew it was Jehovah himself speaking to me from the clouds. I decided to buy the non limited edition album because the extra material in the limited edition might have been too much for me to take in. I suggest you do the same and find out who mike jones really is."
5,D_UNIT,"man this stuff is raw babey!!! u cant be hatin on mike jones, hes the greatest rapper ever!! hes soo funny and soo amazing"
1,:: Slaps forehead. ::,"For a brief period of time, I thought I was begining to hate Lil' Jon....Until Mike Jones came along and made him look like a saint. It's true: they are very different. But as far as no talent goes, Mike Jones takes the cake, stuffs his face with it, and rolls around in it.First of all, the thought that anyone listens to this guy in their free time is disturbing. What makes it even worse are those emo/scene kids who want to be obscure and funny/cool by listening to rap, so they go out and buy mike jones shirts and wear them to local shows and pretend they like it. I swear to god. I cannot believe he is outshadowing outstanding artists like Kanye West.I'm so sick of no-talent hacks like Mike Jones and the Yin Yang Twins and Bow Wow and TI getting all the glory when you could listen to something that sounds GOOD.If you buy this album, may God have mercy on your soul."
1,Mike Jones needs to learn how not to suck!,"If you own this album, destroy it now.This guy is so retarded he dropped out of high school because he thought he could be a baller in the NBA.Going platinum doesn't mean anything if the people buying this album destroy it after buying it."
4,there's a lot of weak tracks,come on i undstand not liking mike jones beacuse he sounds like a parrot but you can't review an album if youu haven't listened to it!
4,major without a major deal,"i have seen a lot of reviews that come from haters.don't hate on him cause he's ph****in great.His lyrics need improving but e doesn't aim on creating a lyrical masterpiece, he just want 2 entertain, and he's great on that.This Cd burns and the sophomore album, the american dream will be bumping so stay on the lookout haterz.Mike keep doing your thang man."
1,Who In The Hell IS Mike Jones?,"Ever hear that old saying ""It's not about what you know but who you know"". That must be true. He had to know somebody who had a studio and a record label. Anybody with any kind of music sense would have never signed this dude. This album is Garbage!He couldn't rap a Christmas gift ! Two reasons this sh*t gets 1 star.....""Still Tippin"" (feat Paul Wall and Slim Thug)(they hold him down on that track) and you can't rate it 0 stars. Save your money man!p.s. We now know who Mike Jones is and we don't give a damn !"
1,this cd is good...,"if you want to cut your wrists while you listen to it. this idiot cant rap and hes the epitomy of one hit wonder, except he has no hits. my friend (a dj) likes him but he doesnt know good music. i used to like rap but i grew out of it like most people do. even though i dont like rap anymore i know good rappers(nas eminem dmx)and mike ""who"" jones isnt one of them. avoid this sorry excuse for a human and rapper."
1,Who Is the Square who Discovered Mike Jones?,"The only thing this is good for is the Swishahouse beats.And the ony song i liked on here is the Got It Sewed up Remix.He has no lyric quality,Here are Mike Jones common linesWHO MIKE JONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHO MIKE JONES!!!!!!!!!!!(3x)281-330-8004 That's the number you can hit me on when you callask for Mike Jones(2x).Just Buy the instrumentals to theese songs orGet Slim Thugs Already Platnum.It's a better release."
1,who gives a sh*t what your phone number is,"wait, is this guy serious? at first, when i heard him i thought he was playing a joke on me. but then i hear his next single, then i hear his whole cd in my friend's car, this guy says the same crap in every song! anyone who likes him should buy a cd from a rapper that, you know, doesnt shout his name and phone number in every line. the only rapper that sucks more than him is his butt buddy paul wall."
1,i am mike jones..........who cares,"i have to agree with all the other reviews on here, same garbage over and over again, always repeats his name, and phone number. and i don't need to know he is from the dirty south. sorry mike but you suck"
1,That's how they do it in the South: retarded,"I always keep forgetting his name, he doesn't repeat it enough. He seems to be bitter that girls didn't want him back then. Why should have girls wanted you back then? You were a loser, you didn't have anything going for you until now. Actually, you're still a loser except you're on MTV now."
1,Poor quality adaptor,I bought this adaptor and found it makes a lot of noise when in use. So I asked for a replacement. The replacement does not make noise any more. But there is 10% chance it will blow your car's fuse.
1,"IT FALLS OUT OCCASIONALLY, LOW QUALITY","The connections arent very good, they wont stay in the optic jacks for very long, maybe i got a bad one. I ordered 2 one of them has a bit better connection than the other, but they are still not that great, what do you expect for 2-3 bucks though right. Pony up the dough for one that is a bit more $ around the 8-10 range, Mediabridge makes some awesome cables, thats the way i go these days."
5,Awesome!,"This was the movie we should have had, instead of that one that was all about the game and Anubis. The writing was really spot-on! This movie had a lot of real closure and warm and fuzziness. What is the power to rule mankind? It's all about what it takes to be a king. Someone even refers to Yami as Nameless Pharaoh! We also get to meet a former possessor of the Millennium Ring from 2,000 years ago, and someone else carrying an evil spirit!!! Cool!"
5,film review,after watching the first film my son could not wait for the next . when he finally got it he but it on and watched it and was not disapointed with it
3,Read other reviews,"There is not many reviews for this color of the product, but read the reviews for Turquoise color and you will see it chips!"
1,Not quite as claimed,"The book claimes to overview and relate various medative tradtions. It doesn't. It forces everything into a set pattern and ignores large chucks of tradition and the teachings of other traditions. The references to Christian prayer are just plain wrong, there is no mention of hesychasm, and the obvious tie in with bhakti devotion totally misstates christian belief and practice. Similar problems are seen with Judaism and Isalem. Some of the Daoist stuff also is very very different from what I've learned.I get a distinct sense the authors just tossed in everything they heard of and forced it to fit into their belief system, without a lot of research. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Buyer Beware,"As someone who had enjoyed The Guess Who I downloaded this album based on reading the reviews and someone who enjoys live albums. I took all the reviews with a grain of salt as I am a bit of a skeptic and knowing most reviews were by big time fans. If you enjoy both The Guess Who and live albums then you will find this one OK, I did not think as great as some of the other reviews. Rather than just enjoying them preform there hits in a quality fashion I find they diviated and tried too hard at times and did not stay within themselves. Still like mentioned above if you are a HUGE Guess Who fan you should enjoy."
3,Original Is Better,"It's just my opinion, but I think the 6 new tracks added to this disc make it very un-original. They do not belong on this cd. They were just not meant to be on here. If they were, they would have been on here from the start!"
2,"sorry, but.........",a Guess Who album without Randy Bachman? Blasphemy!Sorry Burton but the Guess Who is Burton and Randy.Cant bring myself to buy it.
1,A Big Disappointment,"It got one star only because I can't give it negative stars. I saw this on someones list of best live recordings alongside classics like The Allmann Brothers at Fillmore East and Little Feat's Waiting For Columbus. I then read a few reviews that raved about this recording, so I bought it. (...)Randy Bachman and a couple other originals are no longer with the band, they fumble through some lame post-bachman tunes, and the couple of classic tunes they do play are butchered by the slapped-together band. If you want great live music, buy the Allman Bros., Little Feat, Live Dead, The Who's Live At Leeds, or any one of hundreds of live recordings I could name that are far superior to this waste of money."
5,Love it to Death,This was one of my most favorite albums as a teen. But the album was shorter and did not have the extra songs. If you like The Guess Who this is a must for your collection
5,Don`t think twice!,"Don`t think twice aboot buying this CD from this great Canadian band!I am an old rocker that is just now getting into the Guess Who.I had never heard the original LP so this was a nice surprise for me to find this classic show on CD. The great reviews left by the fans encouraged me to buy this CD.This is a great sounding CD for a live concert hall performance from way back when.If you want studio perfection buy one of the hit collection CDs from the Guess Who.I was a little taken aback with the different version(or slower version)of ""New Mother Nature"",but I understand bands get tired of doing the same song over and over the same way.The extra tracks seemed to fit right in on this CD and that is a rare thing."
2,Think twice before buying,"Great set, great performance, but the recording leaves a lot to be desired. I've heard bootlegs that have better sound quality than this disc. It's an okay buy for a dedicated fan, but anyone new to The Guess Who would be better off with another live album or the studio recordings. It's a five-star recording on a one-star disc."
1,Would not buy a Sony again,"Well it started out good... It was nice having high-quality Mini DV recordings, the wireless connectivity, firewire to my computer, and all the other bells and whistles. BUT... after having this Sony for a couple years, and the warranty is out, I am stuck with a dog! It worked fine until right before the warranty ran out. While it was still under warranty, it went in for repairs due to audio cutting out, and all they did was clean it. After a few weeks, it started happening again. TWICE they were unable to fix it! I gave up and just bought a Canon. If Sony can't even fix their own products, I don't think I want to buy them!"
1,No very comfortable,"I bought these shoes hoping it would let me wear high heels again due to the fact I can't after my ACL surgery a few years ago. But they just pinch my toes and the side of my feet from the cheap plastic strap. Also they aren't very comfortable to walk in. I was hoping because they were Dr. Scholl's shoes they were help my knee and feet, but I was wrong. These shoes killed my knee and feet within an hour. A waste of money in my book."
4,Chevy Truck ID Numbers 1946-1972 by Cars and Parts Magazine,"This is a very handy reference book that will break down all the ID numbers including chassis, serial, VIN, engine, plus driveline components like the tranny and rear end, and it will help you ID that unknown truck in the junkyard. Is it a '52 or a '53? Is it a '47 or '49? All these questions are answerable with this reference book. Fairly complete and a good buy for those of you that don't keep this stuff in your head.Have owned my copy for over 8 years and go to it frequently. Especially when considering interchange parts. Also, recommend , Standard Catalog of Light Duty American Trucks to go with it. A fascinating reference book for the light truck enthusiast."
3,"Double Sided-""For 3 shows""","These are good shows but can't believe the Moron's that did this,has 6 shows and they put 3 shows on each side. Why in hell would anyone do this?"
5,GREAT,"Works great and arrived before estimate. My roommate was super excited to receive this. The case was slightly damaged, but overall good buy."
2,This is NOT Beauty and the Beast movie,"I thought I was buying the Disney movie on Amazon instant movie. This is not that movie, but a selection of sad short stories that are based on the original movie. I would return if possible."
1,Cheesy,"Wow, this was such a disappointment. For this to be a spinoff of an award-winning movie is just sad. The plot was unimaginative and trite, and the animation was comparable to an ""okay"" TV cartoon series. We wasted a free rental coupon from Blockbuster on this, and we felt very ""ripped off."" So definitely don't waste your time buying it."
3,I was cheated too...,"Actually I thought was the original motion picture, instead is a serial of short TV style cartoons... my daughter is enjoying them anyway though. I am simply asking why they discontinue the production of the original movie..."
2,A poor Beauty and the Beast movie,Belle's Magical World is the most poor Beauty and the Beast movie ever made. This movie shouldn't be released to DVD. I suggest you don't buy this DVD. It's a total waste of money.
3,Very nice stories and delightful characters.,"BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD really fascinated me from the first time I watched it. My favourite among the stories is Broken Wing, and I also especially like The Perfect Word, although maybe it's meant for a little younger watchers than me. Fifi's Folly is funny as well, but at the first time I was a little disappointed that on the video there was a story with no the Beast at all.The songs, especially the first one, are beautiful as expected. The funniest of the new characters is Webster the Dictionary, and on my opinion, the Beast is treating him and his pen really unfairly.In Broken Wing it's absolutely evident that the Beast is not really what he seems because he doesn't let the little bird remain free, and he is also behaving especially selfishly, imagining he can command a wild bird to sing only for his pleasure. In any case, just because of the theme of imprisoning and setting the bird free that story is the best part of the video."
1,I won't even give this DVD away,"Just because something has Disney's name on it doesn't mean it is good. This DVD is just awful. I watched it with my 5 year old granddaughter, who loves Belle, and even she said it was 'horrible.' The Beast was ill-tempered throughout the stories, along with being selfish, churlish and childish. There are no good messages for children in this DVD. I am throwing it away as in good conscious I can't donate it to any charity."
1,I hate Disney!!!,I'll never buy another Disney product for as long as I live. This is clearly a product designed to mislead people and rip them off. THIS IS NOT BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. THIS IS TOTAL GARBAGE!!! RETURNING THIS DVD. BOYCOTT DISNEY!!!!
1,horrible,Not what I expected at all a waste of money belle wears same dress in all episodes it is a total waste of money.
1,Why?,"Beauty And The Beast - Belle's Magical World is sooo bad its not even posible... how can they get a classic like Beauty And The Beast and turn it into this? the christmas one was bad but not nearly as bad as this... i really dont care if disney likes to make bad sequals and prequals and whatever... but what the heck is this? its not even a disney ""sequal"" cartoon... its a anime gone bad... its just sick i almost cried when i first saw it! how dare they do this? the cover was nice ...so 1 star for that and half a star for using the name "" Beauty And The Beast"" wich is a classic and will live on forever. i know its a sequal...or whatever it is, but i have seen plenty of disney sequals like (101 dalmations 2, lion king 2, Peter Pan 2...and little mermaid 2 ""but not really"") this one has no excuse... its unforgivable!"
3,More from Crystal and Less Peggy Sue,"I have been a long time fan of Crystal Gayle but I wish some of her latter works from the albums Nobody's Angels, True Love, Three Good Reasons, Caged the Songbird, Nobody Wants to Be Alone,and Holloywood Tennesse were included. Several of the last compilation releases include only ""hits"" from her earlier work. Having Peggy Sue sing back up is nice but she should stay in the background. That extra time given to Peggy Sue to warble can be used better with a few more Crystal classics. With so many talented songwriters out there, Crystal needs to record new materialand make new hits. That's my 2-cents."
2,for the name and cover art,"sorry to say, but the truth must out; this is a very boring merzbow cd. No variation, but sure, it's punishing noise for over 70 minutes. if you want noise by merzbow just as transgressively loud but more artistic, with interesting textures and variation - and actual differentiation of actual composition - try 'tauromachine'. (you can tell just by the better names of the tracks that he was more serious - and not conflictingly, more funny as well). and don't miss out on his project with mike patton, 'maldoror'. But 'pulse demon' is useful only as a foil, so your other cd's sound better afterwards. I'll say the same about other popular merzbow releases that are lauded mainly for their 'brutal harshness', and anyone who finds anything 'psychedelic' in this mess, is merely experiencing the predictable effects of pure loud noise; for added 'psychedelic' effect, stay up all night and then eat junk food for breakfast!"
1,zero stars,"I'm a big fan of noisy stuff like John Zorn's Naked City, Fantomas, and the Melvins, but this is just plain bad. It's ear-splitting static for 72 minutes. No variations, no hint of music or even sound effects. Sure, it's extreme, so I can brag about it: ""I own the most annoying CD ever recorded!"" But, other than that, it's a waste of time and money."
4,bizarro brainmelt sounds,"I like to listen to this stuff when I paint. It really gets my mind in the state I need to create. Don't worry about the pain, it will feel good in time."
4,Picturesque and memorable,"Styron raises enough intriguing issues and questions that A Tidewater Morning could have been a full-bodied novel. Instead, we are treated to three short stories that, while somewhat disjointed, do manage to flow with relative ease. There's little new material addressed here: Styron returns to his favorite themes of slavery, war, and death, but he does manage some fresh twists that allow Tidewater to stand memorably on its own merits."
2,First it was not Pro-Stat 64!,"It was Pro-Stat sugar free. Had the same item number but was much thicker, stronger taste and caloric content jumped from 72 to 100 (28%)."
4,Good Stuff,"Looks good! Printed strips for address labels so haven't seen big blocks of color, but from what I did it appears it will handle well for all stickering needs.And easy to peel strips.."
4,From Amorphis's best era,"For me, _Tales from the Thousand Lakes_ was the best Amorphis album. Not as epic as Elegy, but it was as thoughtful, with the most dense, heavy, and rich texture they have ever achieved.The Black Winter Day EP contains songs written during that time. These songs are even more focused on the feel of the folk tales. The keyboard work on these songs is as central to these songs as it is on Black Winter Day (the song).I usually hate keyboards, but the keyboard/moog parts are especially effective in these songs and blend as well with the guitars as the guitar leads do.Basically, this is more from the keyboard-driven side of _Thousand Lakes_."
4,Good product but not a steam cleaner,"They call this product easy steamer. It is easy but it is not a steam cleaner.It uses hot water which does not turn into steam.Having said that, the machine is very easy to use and it is effective.We were surprised how dirty the water was in the tank which clearly showed how much unseen dirt was in the rug.I would recommend this product ."
2,Carpet Cleaning Crap,"Bought this brand new, and used it twice. Why twice? Because after cleaning part of my living room, the spray decided not to come out. I re-installed everything, and took it apart, and checked everything, but nothing came out when turned on, and the trigger depressed. I waited an hour, and it decided to spray again, only this time there was no suction.This thing is a piece of crap.I suggest avoiding this product."
1,Not worth it,"I've had many ""low-end"" steam cleaners-meaning under $150. This is the worst by far. It shoots the water out, but doesn't suck it back up. Also, the design of the hose attachment is not good. It's clumsy and in the way to have it stored on the cleaner as it is designed to do so. I would recommend either going with a bissell or spending more money."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I had purchased a Dirt Devil carpet cleaner some years back and it was put together well and did a good job cleaning as well as removing water. This model is definitely not worth the money even if it is cheaper than other carpet cleaners. It is flimsy, difficult to use and left half the water in the carpet (I measured it). I don't have anything good to say about this product."
1,Bad programming,"Who was the idiot(s) that wrote the software for the Radica Solitaire 2000?!!??? Many years ago, we purchased the Radica Solitaire 2320(or 2380..). The program was fine and you could, with some playing, expect to win daily.Not with the 2000! One is lucky to win weekly, playing all day.You folks have lost the concept! The idea isn't to win. THE IDEA IS TO COMPETE FOR HIGH SCORE!!! The 2320 would let you win without deducting the 20 points for going more than 3 rounds. In other words, you could win (and compete) before it went past 3 rounds. NOT WITH THE 2000!!!! It is virtually impossible to win on the 2000 before it deducts the 20 points.I can't tell you how disappointed my wife and I are with your poorly programmed 2000...But, we're sure you'll delete this review...Don and Sandra Chute"
3,Changes to Klondike,"The shape and large screen make this solitaire game fun and easy to play. However, I would like to see some changes to the Klondike style of play. I have been playing hand held solitaire games for about 15 years. This is the third one I have had. I have owned the RADICA: for about 1 year. My previous 2 were submerged in water by my kids. The things I would change are: You cannot move a card form one stack to another if it has more than one card on it, for example- {7 of hearts, 6 of clubs, 5 of hearts, 4 of clubs} you cannot move the 6,5,4 cards onto the 7 of diamonds, witch I have been able to do on other games. When you use up all of the cards on the first draw of a set you are deducted points when you draw again in the same set. And last, the dicard area, were you start with Aces, you cannot choose the card you want to bring back to the card stacks, the game chooses for you. With the previous solitaire games that I have had you could do all these things."
2,Who did the software for this new Solitaire???,My husband and I have been playing the Radica Solitaire games for many years. Why do they have to change the design so radically??? Whoever did the software for the new one did a very poor job. Don't bother playing the Vegas version on this new design!
2,a dream game,"I'm slighty disappointed. I've owned radica solitaire for 10 years or more. My game just wore out, but I knew how long to play each game. Onthis new game, it takes me longer to complete a game and the button or area near the total at the top, does not work so there isn't a grand totalto look forward to.How do I get this button to work?"
4,"Great, but addictive game.","I love this solitaire game. It's easy to read, quite addictive, and hard to put down. I've had it a while and enjoy it alot, but I am thinking about getting a color solitaire handheld game, so I can see the red and black suits."
2,Pompous & Boring,"I did not like this book at all. Granted that the author comes from a social class I do not like, but his writing fails to appeal to me when other books on upper classes do appeal to me."
4,A trip down Memory Lane,"My Dad, sister and I use to listen to this tape and sing along with it. I love Red Sovine but am not a big Country music fan. It is the trip down memory lane that gets me every time."
1,I can't believe I even bought this book,"I have really not liked the ""Edge"" series at all from Walker, so why in the world I bought this one, I still can't figure out. It was poorly written, boring and difficult to follow. I finally was able to get through this book unlike the last one, but I am beginning to wonder if Walker has ever been to Houston. At least he got the weather more correct this time, but I work downtown and have been looking for buildings one could jump from one to the other. Most buildings here take up a city block and jumping across five or six lanes of roadway is just too unbelievable. But poetic license aside, I wonder if Walker's students are writing this series because they don't seem to be written by the same person who is writing the ""Instinct"" series."
3,Keeps you guessing so that's a good thing!,"If you want believable situations between Native Americans and how a real police department would work then don't read this book. Put that aside and it's quite entertaining as a who done it and how are the bad guys gonna get caught. I think the serial killer angle was different and that gave this book an edge. I picked it up when my flight was delayed at the airport and almost finished it by the time I got home.This book would have only gotten 2 stars if it hadn't managed to keep me surprised from time to time because as some reviewers claimed it does lose touch with reality from time to time. But fast pacing, viewpoints from all the major characters and a few twist and turns will keep you interested."
5,It's a gift!,"Anything by Isaac Bashevis Singer is a gift! These are a few of his lesser known tales, strongly written, which give insight into his feelings and mind. Nachas!"
5,Absolutely Beautiful at a Good Price!,After searching and searching for the perfect comforter set I finally found it. I was looking for a comforter set for my new granddaughters mini crib and this is it. It is a perfect fit! Looks Beautiful against the cherry crib. The same set sold for $100.00 more than what I paid from this site. I'm more than pleased with this item........ You have to purchase yourself to see.
5,Thorough and Interesting,"Not only an excellent story that keeps your interest, but a real lesson to be learned by anyone involved in health care. The Lyme story reveals much about the doctor-patient relationship (or, frequently, the lack thereof) that every physician should read. A must read for anyone interested in the dynamics of both Lyme Disease and doctor-patient relations written as mystery novel"
3,"Are you a beginning organizer, activist, or advocate?","If you are a novice at organizing people around important community issues, this is a good book for you. This book can be used as a ""how to"" guide for those seeking to put together advocacy campaings. If you want to change something in the world or in your community, this book is a good place to start. For more seasoned organizers, this book is review, but it is a good resource to have around your home or office. Jim Shultz has been doing this work for a long time and he lays out strategies that WORK in a manner that is helpful and repectful. The book is also easy to read- no complicated jargon."
5,"Great, clear","Great book, well organized. Clear and to the point. I used it in both my graduate classes and with high school students."
3,None.,Arrived when expected. Product not what was expected. Order 'used - like new' received 'used - acceptable'. Pages are highlighted and written in. Pages are bent. Majority of the book is water damaged.
5,I've Only Just Started.......,"I've managed three episodes so far and wish I could carve out time to watch this straight through. The cinematography is extraordinary, the plot riveting and subtitles adequate, even sometimes amusing. This is an absolute thumbs-up!"
3,Close Up,"Started off really good, interesting & in detail. Ending was bland, just list of productions with no mention of the important people in his life. What happened to his beloved auntie & sisters."
4,US Acres,Garfield is fine and funny but U.S. Acres is awesome! That's the part worth buying the DVD for. The walking egg...does it get any better than that?
3,A note to buyers,"These sets contain the international version of the show. That means all of the ""US Acres"" segments are called ""Orson's Farm"" (its international name). As for volume 1, it does not contain the more iconic episodes of the series and used the ""Friends are There"" intro instead of the more well remembered ""We're ready to Party."" Also, these episodes originally aired before the show was on CBS Saturday mornings which is where I always saw it, so I don't recognize any of the episodes in this set."
2,Poor video quality,"I used to love getting up on Saturday morning and watching Garfield and Friends so I was thrilled when I found the DVD's. I ordered volume 1 and was disappointed to find the quality of the video extremely poor, the colors faded in and out and the picture was intermittently distorted. I returned it to the supplier and they sent me a new set, it is a little better but the colors still fade in and out. In the meantime I bought a Garfield holiday DVD from Target and it has the same problem. I suspect that the problem lies with 20th Century Fox themselves, 3 DVD sets from 2 different sources all with the same problem. I certainly won't waste my money on any more, how disappointing!"
4,Good deal,"I loved Garfield & Friends as a kid and was excited to see it as low as $15. It's an excellent deal for a full season of this show. The one knock on it is that on my HD-tv, the picture quality is just okay. You can tell they didn't bother enhancing the cartoon much to make it look better on dvd. Besides that, I'm very satisfied."
4,Not the average Garfield cartoon!,"When I first saw Garfield's Nine Lives I found life No. 7 to be scary, No. 6 to be sad, and No. 9 went completely over my head. However I highly reccomend this video to any young adult that likes cartoons because they will not be disappointed. I think the best cartoon is No. 6 because the theme ""Diana's Piano"" is a beautiful solo piano piece (available ""Garfield TV Specials Songbook"" for solo piano). The only complaint I have about the video is that they don't tell you the names of the songs played in No. 6. I did find out that the finale of the concert for Diana is Debussy's ""Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum"" from The Children's Corner. No. 6 also has some beautiful animation. In contrast, the life spent with Handel (forgot the number, probably 4) has interesting abstract animation and is fun to watch."
5,Garfield & Friends is Great!!,"Just got Vol. 1 of Garfield & Friends from a local comic shop yesterday, and was amazed by how much more there was then I expected.Get the 24 episodes mentioned, but also have the original theme (""Friends Are There"") on the eps. and the DVDs are chock-full of Quickies - having 1 before the opening theme, and then between 1 to 3 others during the episodes."
4,Yay!,Finally a good DVD full of Grafield. I give it 4 stars because US Acres isn't very funny. Plus The theme song is sure to make u blow up after 3 times of hearing it because it is VERY anoying. Well the garfield parts are off the hizzle for shizzle.
2,I'm a Garfield Fan But This stinks!,I thought this movie would be great when I bought it.I should have gotten my money back! I'm a big fan of his comic books and movies but this I thought was lousy. The next thing I didn't like was at the end they basicly made God look dumb. God askes them how many lives was that. Garfield replies one. God says very well you may have your nine lives back. Then God askes them if Odie was a dog. Garfield says yes he is. So God gives them there lives back. The point being God knows when you lie to him. He is not dumb. So I really looked down on tis film ever scence. The other part i didn't like was that in the begining God created the world. God also created cats. So why is the cat crawling out of the sea. I considered that evolution. God created the world not some animal. We did not revolve. Genesis 1:1 says In the begging God created the heaven and the Earth. So please if you do decide to rent this movie take this thought into consideration.
3,I know a lot of people like it but...,"I was told about these guys from a friend of mine whose taste i respect a lot. He told me to check them out after i told him i was in love with Blood Mountain by Mastadon. Not even close to the same thing. Neorosis is really slow and drowny, with long songs that don't really seem to go anywhere. It's metal so it's cool, but i probably won't listen to this too much unless i need some music to sleep to on a day i'm feeling a little evil."
5,What else can you say....,"This little ditty is the sound of the end of all. If there is a G-d, and it digs music, this will be the sound track for the end of the world. If at Dec 31, midnight, you hear this, kiss your hinney, bye-bye"
5,Simply Crushing,"While I'm not going to go into great detail with this review, I will say that if you are a fan of heavy music, and have a little patience, you will not be dissapointed by this album. A quote from an AP magazine article said it best; ""they move slow, but they damn sure get the job done.."" I'm pretty certain that this is Neurosis' best work. Best track: Locust StarIf you really want a life-changing experience, see them live, you will be affected. Excellent Album"
5,One Breathtaking Audio Adventure,"""Through Silver In Blood"" is one of those albums that is meant to create an atmosphere that you can easily get lost too. This album is a showcase of blending in ambience, sludge, tribal, and progressive music all into one. Crushing riffs and perfectly blended vocals by Scott Kelly and Scott Von Till make this album an essential. Excellently crafted musicmanship is also a big role in this album, as it is nowhere close to being predictable. There is nothing that can match up to this brilliance, and many bands have looked up to this album as well (examples: Isis, Mastodon, Pig Destroyer).This album is an essential for your collection whenever you want to experience crushing music with an ambient touch to it. I highly recommend this album, along with the rest of their works from 1992 to onward (starting withSouls at Zero, and the albums before that were hardcore punk styled, which I also recommend)."
4,"Although I enjoyed this book, it is not very satisying.","I have enjoyed all of the books in this series. However, this book has several deaths that seem rather unncessary to the overall plot, mainly the deaths of Katy and her newborn baby. Therefore, I did not recommend it as highly as I do the other books in this series. Perhaps it just was too realistic for me. I just received the sixth book in the series today, and I hope that it is a more satisfying read!"
1,"To many Deathes , full of Depressing stuff",I found this book to be very depressing. First Ingeborg loses the baby in book 4 and is unable to have an other one. Haaken never has a son that he and Ingeborg want. When Katy died while having her's and Zeb's baby that was too much. I had grown to like Katy and Zeb and the author took both of them out along with the baby. Way did she make Zeb leave when Deborah and Manda needed him? It just depresses me. Then she thinks she can replace Zeb and Katy with Zeb's sister and the pastor. The only thing that could keep me reading the series is if Zeb comes back. I wonder if Laurine Snelling every had a happy childhood. I as a 14 year old didn't like the deathes or the depressing stuff that was in her book.
2,Couldn't Get Into It,I tried to read this book; the first chapter seemed interesting and I thought it was promising. But after that I just could not get into the story -- just too many characters and storylines that weren't about the main characters. I wanted to hear more about Pastor Solberg and MaryMartha. I couldn't finish it. Sorry!
3,I felt somewhat cheated,"I enjoyed this book in the series, just as I have enjoyed the others, however, I felt cheated! The author took great strides in laying the foundation and introducing us to Inegborg and Kaaren Bjouklund. Through the first three books, we learned all about these two sisters (in-laws). Now, they have been set to the back burner as minor characters. I would have liked to see these characters evolve, how the children grow up and how they grow old and become grandmothers. I have little feeling for the new characters that have been introduced because we know so little about them. This is a good book, but for completion, I would have rather followed the lives of Inegborg and Kaaren."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"This book was not what I was expecting given the past books in the series. Although it still shares the general atmosphere of life in the Red River Valley of the North a century ago, the constant barrage of new characters (there must be 40 now!) makes the book confusing and storylines can get mixed up."
3,"Tragedy ,heartbreak and potpourri","Book 5 of this series was sort of a hodgepodge about too many people, and there was a lot of death. The pastor is featured more as the teacher of the school. Zeb's sister Mary Martha is prominent and Singer Sewing machines are introduced into the community. This causes a huge rift between Penny and Goldie. Ingeborg remains unable to conceive. Sign language has come to Blessing in order to help little Grace communicate. A fire in the grain house takes the life of a man traveling through. Politics are in full gear, with debates and Hjelmer traveling for meetings. Mary Martha is called back home to nurse her ailing mother. Little Anna contracts whooping cough and dies. Perhaps the central tragedy occurs with Katy during childbirth. Personally, I hope this book is a bridge to a happier conclusion of this series with book #6."
2,Tried for SEVERAL months and no difference,Played it on repeat at night for several months because really wanted to give the cd a chance. Very disappointed that still feel no different. I gave it credit for nice sounding music though...
2,better than the last Friday Movie but still stuck on formula,"the last Friday Movie was Wack,but this one is a little bit better in places but after a while not much really changes with Ice Cube Movies.and while Ice Cube won't go Down as a Good or a Great Film-Maker He will go down as a Smart BusinessMan who knows His Hustle&also got a Formula that You can't stop.the Cat has a Winning Formula even if His Films are as Predictable as Him Saying YA!YA!"
2,"Friday again, and Santa tries to steal X-mas....","Another sequel to the original story which does not come close to measuring up to the first film. In this film, Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) are back in the old neighborhood after a detour to the suburbs. They end up getting robbed by a Santa Claus thief on Christmas Eve and the landlady demands to get her rent money or her son will throw them out on the street. Having this threat hanging over them, they begin a new job as security guards with the hope of getting a pay advance to pay their rent. Friday After Next is a comedy with some very awkward moments and characters that are tied into an awkward story. Nevertheless, there are occasionally jokes and moments that offer laughter, but nothing more. In the end, this is a poor cinematic experience and the Friday theme should now be considered wiped out."
2,That's enough of the Friday movies,"Don't get me wrong, this movie had it's moments, where I couldn't stop laughing, but now enough is enough. NO MORE FRIDAY MOVIES ICE CUBE."
1,Friday 3 review!,"Bottom of the barrel third entry in the Friday series is supposed to play like ""a Christmas in the hood"" comedy with the bumbling cousins from the previous FRIDAY film doing a ""Christmas Friday"".This movie has little to do with the last two FRIDAY movies and even less to do with Christmas. Most of the new characters are obnoxious and the old characters have none of their flare from their previous movies."
4,Smokey must come back....,"This installment of Friday was better than the 2nd one, but nothing will ever compare to the first unless they bring Chris Tucker back in the mix. It's just not the same without him anymore...Epps is a funny guy though. Plus, this one was way shorter than the other Friday's I thought...all and all, it good for some laughs!"
1,This is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can't believe that people have the nerve to compare this to the oringal one with Chris Tucker or even the second. I watched this piece of unfunny white goofball movie and wanted to cry. I really peeved me off that people had the nerve to say it deserved better or claiming that people were only bashing it because it was a black film, but no it was horrible and seemed to need the touch of DJ Pooh and a return of Chris Tucker to make it funny. This is just a crappy movie that needed not to be made. Sorry Cube."
3,"IT'S STILL FUNNY, BUT REALLY DID IT HAVE TO GO TO #3?","THIS TIME, CRAIG AND DAY-DAY GET ROBBED BY SANTA CLAUS WHILE THEY'RE ASLEEP. KNOWING THEY'RE RENT MONEY IS DUE, THEY MUST NOW FIND A WAY TO EITHER CATCH THE SANTA THAT ROBBED THEM OR GET A JOB AND RAISE THE MONEY BACK. EVERYBODY'S STILL FUNNY, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULDA WENT PAST THE ORIGINAL ''FRIDAY''. GOOD MOMENTS AND NOT TOO LONG RUNNING TIME MAKES THIS ACCEPTABLE. BUT FOR REAL, DON'T DO A FOURTH FRIDAY!"
1,A Christmas don't,What's so funny about a robbing santa claus. This movie was so ghetto and made no sense. I hated we even watch this lame turkey movie. Another crack pot movie. I am glad they stopped making the friday's movies. And why can't they make a movie with no cussing. Every 3 words here comes a bad one. A total don't.
2,making a trilogy really wasnt a good idea,"I agree the first one had spark and the second one was ok but this one is ok too but it goes on way to long with its dirty jokes and its potty humor. Epps and Cube get a few laughs. My favorite scene is when Epps terroizes the religious ladys, thats the funniest part in there. it starts off good with santa riping them off but then boom it explodes and never comes back. hope they DONT make a fouth movie"
3,Don't listen to critics...,"I know I know, it may sound contradicting since I'm going to give you my own take on the movie but hey what can I say. This movie was actually good. Worth the money to see. But here's where it lays in the friday series'. The best Friday was naturally the originally, not suprising at all since sequels don't usually do as well as the orginals. Then Next Friday and then this one. The quality of the movies went in order of make. Don't listen to these ignorant people claiming Next Friday wasn't good. I say POO-EY to that. Friday After Next was good, not as good as Next Friday which was not as good as the original Friday. Clear now? And thats how it is."
1,Don't get fooled into even watching this movie,"If you enjoyed the first Friday, then you will find this one a complete waste of time. They've run out of material. There is no plot. No direction. No comedy! Who are these people giving this piece of junk 3/4/5 stars? I'm hoping you, the reader of this, has better taste. Life is short, don't waste it on this film!"
4,Not As Funny As The First But Far Better Than The Second,"I've seen all three Friday films and the first is the king! That being said, I think this one should've been the second one because its ALMOST as funny as the original! At least they kept some continuity with each film.I totally agree that Money Mike makes this film! I also thought the final chase scene where Craig and Da-Da chase the shaddy Santa all through the neighborhood was hilarious! Again, not as good as Friday but better than Next Friday!"
3,"Very Funny in Places, Lot Better than first two","The third in the friday series is the funniest movie of the three. The first two were very boring and had very little laughs in them but the third is hillarious in places. Thank god Chris Tucker was not in this one as he was dreadfull in the first Friday Movie. I recommend ""Friday after next"" but for real side splitting knockout funny comedy check out ""Don't be a menace to South Central while drinking your juice in the Hood"" starring the fantastic Wayans Brothers."
4,Christmas in 'Da Hood!!!,"Friday After Next is an okay Christmas movie. Bad Santa is better. Craig and Day-Day get robbed by Santa Claus on Christmas Eve morning, and try to get it back so the landlord won't throw them out. During a pimped out Christmas party, Craig and Day-Day find Santa Claus and follow him. My favorite part is when Craig and Day-Day chase Santa all around the hood and have to deal with an old guy with a shotgun! If you love Christmas, and chillin' with yo' homies, you'll love FRIDAY AFTER NEXT!!!p.s. 6 years ago, a friend and I made a movie that spoofed this movie! It was awesome! (Good times!)"
3,Take For Whay It Is,Friday After Next to me wasn't as good as the first time nor was it complete trash. The film had plenty of funny gags but they weren't back to back like the previous films. Mike Epps is still funny but Kat Micah Williams and Terry Crews still the movie from him. If you want some tasteless fun then check this out.
3,friday after next,"its worth seeing at your local dollar or discount theatres. its one of those movies you should just rent and not buy.friday #1 was the best,and the only friday movie worth buying to have in your dvd collection."
1,Terrible,"Boring and the funny moments are few & far between. Friday was a true classic. This, however, was a true waste of money."
3,INTERESTING FAMILY MOVIE THAT INSPIRED THE HIT TV SHOW!,"I was a fan of the TV show and had not seen the original movie in many years. It's interesting to see how Sandy and Flipper become close friends in this nice little family movie. Chuck Conners plays 'Porter Ricks' in this film, but would be re-cast in the TV series and they would add another son. Another little gem I found in the bargain bin. The DVD transfer looks good."
3,Quality a bit off!,"I bought this just so I could see the ""incredible Mr Limpet"". I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the DVD. I skips in parts, even though there are NO visible signs of scratches, etc on the disc.Other than that, you still can not beat the value of getting 4 movies in one set!"
5,"Classic Colection, 4 movies","The classic 4 movie DVDS was packaged well and damage occured during shipping. The DVD cover and disk were in new/perfect condition. My fiance and I enjoyed watching all 4 classic movies: Lassie Come Home, National Velet, Flipper and the Incredable Mr Limpet. We watching/enjoyed thesemovies and they brought back good memories of our childhood. We received 4 incredable classic movies that we will keep, add to our movie collection and share with faily or friends. We received an incredable value without having to pay shipping or tax."
1,"CCD repaired, but they messed up the audio!","This was a great little camcorder until the CCD issue. Yes, they repaired it for free and quite quickly. However, I just today watched the video we've taken since getting it back, and there is a VERY LOUD mechanical noise buzzing rhythmically off and on in the background. It sounds like its internal to the camera (can't be outside the camera since the footage is taken over a couple of months in a variety of locations). So now I can pay $211 for Sony to repair it. Great!"
2,Sony Door weight. Very dissapointing,"I have had this camera for just over a year. 8/14/03 is the purchase date. I used it a total of 12 times for maybe 20 minutes max, kept it locked up when not in use, and now it doesn't work. I paid extra for Sony ""quality"". There were other cameras I would have rather had (cheaper, more compact with more features) but bought the sony because of Consumer Reports listing Sony's as having low occurances of repairs. One thing I did like better when this camera was working was the nightshot feature. It was much better than the night shot feature on the Panasonic GS-15 I just bought to replace the Sony.I called Sony and they offered my a flat fee of 269.00. Not willing to throw good money after bad because I have already spent over 600.00 dollars on a camera that only lasted a year with only a few uses."
1,"If you buy this product, buy the warranty!","When I record with my DCR-TRV19 I have sound and a black picture. I bought the camera 04/30/2004 and this problem started in February 2005, less than a year from purchase. Sony will only replace parts after a year (not labor which lasts 90 days). I will have to ship it carefully to Connecticut with a cover letter to have it repaired for the flat rate of $269.00. The rep could not break down the repair rate for labor and parts. I mentioned to the Sony customer repair that I have read other consumer reviews with the same problem, and he told me he will make a note of my problem.I feel foolish for purchasing this product since my last Sony Handcam which I bought in 1995 also stopped working mysteriously (atleast that one lasted a few years)."
3,SONY WILL REPAIR YOUR DCR-TRV19 AT NO COST..,"AMAZON please post this!!!! I and many others like you have suffer the same faith with the Sony DCR-TRV19 ""No video after a few months of use"". Please go to this link http://esupport.sony.com/, select Model Home , enter DCR-TRV19 in Option 1 , select the green arrow, choose the LCD screen is black in the Hot Topics menu, the next screen will SAVE you $250. I just received my unit and it works fine. They'll even pay for shipping."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! Works wonderful until video recording capability disappears!,"Like numerous other reviewers, I too loved my camera for the first year that I had it. I bought it after our first baby was born, and used it about 10 times over the course of 18 months. When I went to record her 2 year birthday party, the LCD panel was black, and I couldn't record anything but audio. I now see that this is a VERY common defect in this product. Unfortunately, Sony good name no longer equates good product. Very disappointed in Sony for not recalling these. Obviously a design flaw somewhere based on how common this problem seems to be with this camera."
1,Product Defect - BUYER BEWARE!!!,"There is a defect that shows up after about a year of use wherein the unit cannot record video anymore - all other functions are retained, including audio recording.Sony will charge you over $250 to fix it...stay away from this model..."
3,Nothing New,"If you've read a lot of his other material, then this book provides nothing new. In fact, I would prefer to read his other books, which directly teach you how to impove your thinking.This is like reading a weaker version of his recent book REBT: it works for me / it could work for you."
4,An Anthology of Legends,"The legends in this collection have been and continue to be told in Indiana. There is a voice of authenticity in the texts, and readers will gain an understanding of ways that stories about hauntings, local characters, unique places, and other subjects are actually told by storytellers in Indiana. The introduction is well written, and Baker provides a good overview for ways to understand the legends. There is also an excellent bibliography for further study of this interesting facet of American folklore."
5,Cute product,My son is in love with this toy. We actually got it for xmas but let him play with it before we wrapped it (he is only a year) and he will be just as happy when he opens it on xmas morning! :)
5,Rocking good time!!,"I originally got this puppy for my daughter's 1st birthday in 2004. Since then it has been a huge success with every kid that comes into my home. Now my 1 yr old twins and the 3 other children I watch in my home love it. It is durable (has not broken or chipped since purchase), inexpensive for the value, and cleans super easy. It makes a great gift."
5,This is such a fun toy!,I bought this toy for my 1 year old daughter and she loves it!! She has a great time rocking on it and loves pushing it all around our house.
4,Great toy,My grandchildren love this toy.What more can grandparents ask of a gift?The one year old needs assistance with it but still enjoys it and the 2 1/2 year old has a rocking good time.
4,My daughter enjoys this while watching TV,My 18 month old will sit and rock while watching TV. Its very well made and cute. For longer play she tends to be more interested in her dolls and pushing carts. But its perfect as a little seat for her to sit on.
4,Great Gift,This is a great product for all ages. I bought this for my 11 mo old for xmas and he was able to use it right away even though he is on the short side. But even my 4 yr old can use it so you will get many years of use with this. My son doesn't use it as often as I thought he would but maybe he is still overwelmed with all his xmas toys he got. It is really well made and very sturdy. I am surprisd how affordable it is. This would be a great gift!
5,Durable and Fun!,"Lots of fun and SUPER durable! Our friendly big blue puppy is about to celebrate his 6th birthday and he doesnt look a day older than 1! My older children loved this dog, my youngest is under the recommended age for this toy but is already enjoying it very much with some assistance. Besides the durability my most favorite thing about this toy is the fact that it doesnt require batteries as there are no electronic parts to it! Ive heard many delightful and imaginative sounds being made while my kids are/were enjoying this fellow."
4,Rocking Puppy,I purchased this toy for a friend's nephew for his first birthday and he loves it! It's the perfect size for him.
5,Rocking Puppy,Bought this rocker for my grandson's first birthday and it is money well spent. He loves it and we find it safe for him to use. Would recommend this for any active child.
5,Be Careful While Shipping!!,"Yes, it is Nov 21st and my kids already love this toy! I know this because this item is shipped in it's own box. So, the UPS guy rings the doorbell and my kids went running to find the Rockin Puppy on my front porch. So, needless to say, Santa won't be able to bring this toy on Christmas like he had planned. So, if this is a christmas gift, you may want to ship it somewhere other than your home. Great gift though, my 4 year old and 18 month old are loving it!!"
2,just ok,"This was a 1st birthday gift for a very active little boy. he pretty much ignored it. It is now for sale on craiglist. He used it maybe 5 times, not for lack of availability, just lack of interest....the toy appear indestructable though. Well made."
3,Some rough edges,I'm not sure why the seams are so sharp and rough - you WILL need to file them down as others have reported. It's light weight and kids love it.
3,Cute,Super easy to use basically just attach stickers to it. We keep this in the playroom and so far so good
3,Missing Eyes,"This item came without the eyes. We're still waiting on replacements. Other that that, our granddaughter loves it and plays alot on it."
4,Love this toy!,We had a horse for the first 6 kids that finally wore out. I just bought this one for #7 and he loves to sit on it already. My only disappointment is he sometimes bangs his mouth on the head while riding too fast. We had the same problem with the first one but the good far out weights the bad!
5,Absolutely perfect for 18 month old,"I actually got this toy free at Toys R US when I purchased the Little Tikes basketball set. From the photo I thought this was a plastic nothing but my 18 month old little girl loves it! Easy to get on, off, sometimes rides it backwards but no biggie--we flip her around until she learns herself. Nice toy, nice price and would've paid for it if I had known she'd enjoy it this much! Hope this helps..."
2,"Cute, but has a lot of competition","My 13 month old ended up with two rocking horses and this puppy at Christmas due to lack of family communication. If she would have only recieved this one, I think it would be used more. One of her ponies sings while she rides it so of course that's her favorite. The only bad thing about this one is she learned almost right away that she can stand on the seat and rock it. It's really low to the ground. I can't leave it in her room unless I'm in there because I don't want her to climb on it and knock a tooth out! But, she does like it. When I bring it out, she keeps saying ""puppy, puppy!"" and climbs on by herself."
3,Not very much fun.,I bought this puppy for my daughter's 1st birthday. She is now 18 mos old and still only rides this toy every now and then. It seems like she is not interested because the puppy doesn't rock very much on our carpeted floors. Perhaps this toy is better suited for a non-carpeted surface.
5,Holds up,Got this last year for my son's first birthday and it has held up well with lot of rough use. Great toy!
5,Rocking Puppy,"Got this for my grandsons 1st birthday.It is the perfect size for him. He wasable to get on and off by himself andcan rock it. Perfect gift for a one year old.Love it! And a good price, and comes inColors."
4,Great toy for the price!,My grandson is still a little too young to use this rocker well but I can already tell you it's a great toy for the price. It's simple & very sturdy.
4,tons of fun for my little guy,My son loves dogs so this was the perfect gift for him. I bought it for him when he was 18 months and it is a favorite of his. He loves the felt material eard. Only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because he likes to try to stand on it and rock so supervision is a must at all times.
2,My sons were not impressed,"This toy must be one of those 'hit or miss' type things. My sons were not impressed at all - got on once or twice, and then left the poor blue puppy abadoned in the corner until I sold it on Craigslist. LOL."
2,Average,"This toy is very average, It really does not do anything special. My daughter has to put in extra effort to get it to move. I was under the impression that it would be like a little rocker."
1,What leather?,"It looked and smelled like a quality leather belt but within a week of my starting to wear it, it started to tear. That's when I found out that most of the belt was made out of a weak cloth like substance with a coating that looks like leather. If you need any strength at all from your belt, don't get this one and I would advise you not to buy from this company."
1,Bad quality,"This theater belt was fake theatre not real! Terrible quality! I would like to send it back for a refund however it was a gift for someone else and as such has not mentioned anything to me, I suspect they are being polite ."
2,"you get what you paid for, a cheap belt","I got this because I really wanted a belt so I can wear my belt buckles. It did just that. Over-all, I thought it kinda sucked. The inside lining is tearing and peeling of. Have to buy another belt after having this for about two weeks. I am not buying this again. BUT it is a cheap belt, you get what you paid for."
1,sent the wrong size i called them and they sent the wrong size again..,I CALLED THESE PEOPLE I BROUGHT THE BELT FROM. THE BELT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A 54-56 INCH BELT.I MEASURED BOTH BELTS THEY DID NOT MEASURE 56 INCHES..THEY DID SENT ME ANOTHER BELT.STILL THE SAME BELT
2,You get what you pay for,This is low cost leather belt and it is also a very low quality leather belt. Only had it 4 weeks and it is already stretched on the buckle holes and is showing great wear. will opt for the better quality belt next time.
1,Horrible Product,"I bought this belt, and after 2 weeks, the holes started ripping. Short and sweet, DON't Buy this belt, VERY cheap"
1,cheaply made. Not leather!,"This belt is very flimsy. The back is felt, and the top is NOT leather. I am very unhappy and would not recommend this seller. This is false advertising. The people that think it's real leather do not know what real leather is."
1,Cheap belt,"The belt that I bought from this company did not meet the expectations that I had for it, not long after purchasing it the ""leather"" started to peel off the belt which just goes to show that the belt really wasn't real leather because I've purchased leather belts before and that has never happened before."
1,Fake - Not Real Leather,Synthetic Leather Looking Belt - fell apart after first use.Don't buy this!!!!
1,get what you pay for,Belt is not real leather that I can tell. It is not to true size. Order one size larger if you want it to be true. Cheap belt....cheap price. Arrived on time and as stated. Vendor supplied exactly what they said they would.
2,substandard,"Ordered belt lasted 2 days, broke, they sent replacement. Received it a week ago, paper backing of belt separating, leather distending, and this is while belt is loose on smallest hole."
1,"poor, you get what you pay for!",I bought three of the belts last month (in april 2012). My daughter used one three days and it started peeling apart. But for a few dollars you will not waist your time sending it back. Maybe for use at one or two times then throw away I buy from amazon all the time and this is so far the only thing I was disapointed with.
2,Disappointed with Purchase,Problems:1. As people have mentioned - not real leather2. The belt I received did not have a slot for the buckle's latch which makes the belt useless.
1,terrible,"the belt i ordered was supposedly within my size range, and when it arrived it was way too small. i know i did not make a mistake because i double (if not triple) check everything."
1,Don't bother with this,"This is about as cheap cost wise as you can get. But still not worth it. The belt cracks at the hole used, and the color comes off on my chinos. Don't bother with it. Get a better belt."
1,Fake Leather?,"Description from seller states that this is leather, but the entire inner lining is FABRIC, and the outer ""leather-textured"" coating peels off like some kind of vinyl. It may have leather pressed into its layers somewhere, but this is not solid leather. Poor quality."
3,You get what you paid for.,"This is the second time I have bought this kind of belt. The first one still holds up my pants but it stopped looking ""nice"" quite a while ago. I'm a teenager though so I was alright with it not looking perfect, it works with all the novelty belt buckles I use and that's all I needed. It was a $4.00 belt, so I wasn't expecting any better. The belt does not take wear and tear very well but neither one I have bought has completely broken on me yet, so it could be worse."
2,Poor quality,The quality of the belt was poor and I was unsatisfied with the belt. Ultimately I went to Bealls and bought a good one. Save your money and don't waste it on this belt.
1,Absolute junk!,"The only thing leather about this belt is a thin laminated strip that peels off of the cardboard composit material witin a couple of weeks!Oh, and this ""Made in the USA"" belt is clearly stamped ""Made in China!""Don't waste your money..."
1,Poor Quality,IT IS NOT 100% GENUINE LEATHER. A very poor product.- The make quality is poor- Not Durable. I could only use it for four weeks.- The material is NOT 100% LEATHER. IT IS FAKE- The material gives a worn look within a week.- The material tore into two.I would not recommend this to anyone.
5,Leather belt,Very pleased with the men's leather belt. Good quality and just what my husband was looking for. No hesitation in ordering again when necessary.
1,Leather Belt,Don't buy this belt if you want something that will last more than a week. At the price I didn't expect something super long lasting but it could have gone more that 1 week. The entire belt is falling apart.
2,leather belt?,"Looks like leather and has very good belt buckle.However,thin strip of a black material stuck on the inside length of the belt flaked off.This spoiled the appearance of the belt."
1,black leather belt with free buckle,"When I was searching for this belt it said it came with a free buckle and I did not get a free buckle, im not sure its real leather it has a very awkward smell and the belt seemed a bit too small to be the advertised size. I'm not very happy with this product."
5,Great gift!,"Inexpensive but totally worth it! My fiance loves to attach his buckle and these belts were a great Xmas gift! I actually ended up ordering two at such a low cost. The only thing I recommend is airing the belts out before gifting them. They do have a strong leather smell upon opening. Other than that, no problems or complaints!"
2,cheap and nasty,"I brought this from a Amazon seller, and it wasn't worth the couple of bucks. The quality is shoddy, like pressed cardboard. I threw out the buckle straight away, basically tin foil. Don't waste you money on this. It was true to size thus the two stars for being able to measure!"
2,The belt is ok...,"The belt is long enough but it's made out of cheap plastic material, you could buy a better one at a swap meet."
5,buy it for entertainment,"I thought this dvd was good, since I do not have cable I buy tv shows and watch them and did recommend this to other people."
1,disappointed,I don't think this book is worth readying. The information was very basic and could be found online. There are many other books out there that are worth reading.
4,"Not the best video ever made, from 1978 show hosted by hottie Jayne Kennedy","Johnny Unitas was surely (at least)one of the top five QBs that everplayed. He was the 1st US QB topass for 40,000+ yards [In the old-er Canadian Football League, onlyRon Lancaster hit 40,000+ quicker]But Unitas DID win four Champion-ships (including one Super Bowl).It was a real shame to see him strugglewith the (then) bad San Diego Chargersin 1973. He, Tom Matte and John Mackey,the best TE in Pro Football history,never should have been chased fromone of the great Football cities inNorth America, Baltimore. I used togo to Baltimore Stallions CFL gamesin 1994-'95. They won the Grey Cupand even the College Park-based Bal-timore Stars of the USFL won that ProLeague's Championship back in 1985!That, along with Unitas Baltimore Coltsand the new Baltimore Ravens, in '01,were the four Baltimore Pro FootballChampionship teams. No city has everahd more Pro different Football teamswin League titles!"
5,Quick crock 20 oz,Wonderful bowls for my parrot. The cage I got didn't come with bows. These work perfect! So easy to clean etc. Very durable.
5,"Premium Price, Premium Quality","I got this for our master bath, and a different brand chrome mirror for the guest bath. The other mirror cost about half, and when I compared them, it's easy to see why. This is a nice hefty unit - the arms and base appear to be solid cast brass. On the other unit is a swing-out type, with thin, hollow tubes and a stamped base that look like steel that's been chromed. The extension mechanism here works effortlessly and silently, with rubber grommets where the scissors arms connect to the vertical tube. This looks and feels like a high-quality unit, and I expect a very long service life. Before you buy a cheaper unit, consider paying the extra to get a far better product."
5,Great find!,"Great quality product. 100% satisfaction. Love it!! If you have a small (or awkward) bathroom, this mirror is just what you need. Use it when you need it, then it folds flat up against the wall, out of the way. It is exactly what we needed. I couldn't find it in any local store, thanks Amazon."
5,finally found Gold!,I have been looking forever to find a wall mounted make-up mirror in a gold finish to match my bathroom fixtures.I am thrilled with the quality of versitility of this mirror and at a reasonble price.It fits smuggly against the wall but adjusts easily for magnifying or regular viewing. You probably need longer screws than provided to secure to the wall.I would definetely recommend this product.
1,A Monument to Being Mediocre,"Whoa. I didn't even know people still thought like this. Something tells me either Mr. Richards didn't really write this or... wait, he didn't write it.I'm sure Mr. Richards is a smart man. After all, he is rich. And all rich people are smart, right?But seriously, what Stan fails to see (even though he gives it lip service) is that creativity is the most important thing to any agency worth it's salt. Not media buying capabilities. Not budgets. Not even account service.He speaks a lot about being a straight shooter, about being in Dallas, about having a jet, etc. But he doesn't really talk about ideas. He doesn't talk about the kind of thinking he loves.But perhaps the worst sin is that he gives us no insight into what he loves. Why are you in this bussiness Stan? What do you like? What don't you like? Why?"
1,They Should Sell These in Antique Stores,A pretty useless book from a pretty useless agency.Everyone would do themselves a favor by studying just about any agency besides this one. The stories in the book reek of a self-serving quality. Its almost as if Mr. Richards wrote this so he could have an excuse to tell the world how wonderful his ideas are.We'll unfortunately they are not great ideas. This book isn't really even about advertising. It's a primer for a philosophy from an aging robot of a creative.
5,Great for a variety of core exercises,After experiencing lower back problems I went to 4 weeks of physical therapy. One of the objectives was to improve core strength. This product was used for 4 different PT exercises and recommended for me to continue at home. You can easily use this at home and really feel the burn. But perhaps they should include instructions and suggestions for use at home if you haven't had the oportunity to use it previously.
4,pretty good but not the best,i felt that the scarlet letters' cliff notes provided more info than this for this commentary had not a sinlg elick of extraneous info in the back of the book.
4,A Useful Tool For The Academic Student or the Life-Long Learner,"I picked up the ""CliffNotes on The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" to see if it would give me some deeper insights into this classic that I had read several times since my introduction in high school. I was not disappointed. I had reread the book in preparation for the notes. I found that the CliffNotes helped me more fully appreciate themes in the book that I had only begun to suspect in my own reading, such as Jim's heroism and paternalism toward Huck, the contrast between the peaceful raft and the turbulent shore and Twain's criticism of his society. Whether you are an academic student looking for help with a class or a life-long learner seeking to delve more deeply into Huckleberry Finn, these CliffNotes are a helpful tool."
5,Perfect help for English literature,The writing style of Mark Twain is hard to understand - especially for a German student in the US. so this book was a very good help!
3,"Alienated Librarians, Why?","The authors premise is that the atmosphere surrouding libraries ends up alienating. This may be true. She attempted to wind together the history and how the profession got to this point. The book looked to be several papers put together. I would have clarified, whether it was meant to be a history of the profession or how to solve present alienation problems. An update is needed to show how the Internet has changed libraries. The best audiences for this, are classes in the history of libraries, library management and all librarians in the profession. The book is still useful, but really could have been several books in a series to cover different aspects of the profession."
4,Formidable Technique,"This release from Geometric Records combines some cuts from Baltimore-based guitarist Carl Filipiak's excellent Hotel Reál (reviewed favorably in the $ensible Sound upon its release several years ago) with some older cuts, making this something of a Carl Filipiak retrospective release. Filipiak's name may never be a household word, but his reputation is spreading, based both on his CDs and his live performances. He is a tasteful performer who does not try to overwhelm the music he is playing by engaging in virtuosic overkill; still, his technique is formidable, as a listen to his version of Jimi Hendrix's ""Little Wing"" readily reveals. He can also be quite lyrical, as he shows on his cover of Stevie Wonder's ""'Cause We've Ended as Lovers."" Peripheral Vision offers a good overview of the work of this talented and versatile guitarist; I urge jazz guitar fans to check it out."
4,"unique, original, spontaneous","Filipiak's musical style can easily be described in just one word- killin'. His unique tones and creative runs make his style of playing seem above the label ""fusion."" Soroka's performance on sax is outstanding and appropraite, and the use of lyricon adds a layer that dives into exciting new grounds. Dennis Chambers is on fire as he lays down beats that are relaxing as a sunset on Malibu, and other times thrilling as a triple-crown winning horse. Perhaps if Carl's music becomes more and more recognized in years to come, fusion jazz may become more recognized, while at the same time unspoiled as it melts into the mainstream. As one of Carl's students, I definetely feel Carl's music should be heard at more than an underground level. And with music becoming ever so easier to obtain, it almost seems inevitable."
4,The Chain Saw Man-review from me,"I thought this book would be an interesting read as well as all the others that she had on her page.I'm a new author,but found this quite interesting,as I have been an avid reader all my life. My hats off to her. Nadia Rehmani-author of Sharper Than A Two Edged Sword-One Womans story of her walk into Islam and Out."
5,Contractors Gloves,Perfect for my grandson on the job in the winter months to save his fingers. I would recommend these to everyone.
3,Difficult to apply,I purchased this to seal a leaky skylight. I have used other sealers to do this with only limited success. I thought this might be the best thing to use but it turned out that it was difficult to apply exactly where needed. In some places it dripped off (around the sides where screws went into the frame. It was also hard to get it into the narrow spaces between the shingles and frame. I don't doubt that it is a good sealer but maybe not as good as I thought for skylights. I didn't even bother to try and clean the brush or the little paint bucket that I used because it is so thick and sticky. I ended up buying another tube of silicone because the skylight still leaked after trying to apply this product. It may be good for other easier to reach areas.
4,good waterproofer,"The brush-on works with a paint roller. Takes a couple of coats, but a good waterproofer for RV. Slower to dry Than I expected. Fast delivery"
3,No Other Choice,"This is an elegant and pleasing evening's entertainment at home on the couch. I wouldn't have purchased it, however, if I'd realized that it's the sweetened ""happy-ending"" version of the opera prepared by Rossini for a tradition-bound Venetian audience rather than the daringly original tragic opera first performed in Naples. Much of the music substituted in Venice will sound hauntingly familiar to Rossini fans, having been cut-and-pasted from La Donna del Lago and other prior compositions. I venerate Rossini with all my heart, but I can't quite shake my disappointment with this production."
2,This book wasn't good as I expected...,"I thought Axis Mundi would be a valuable aquisition to my werewolf stories, but wasn't. The mage storytellers will not understand why, whitewolf told that book would be useful for Mage campaigns. I wasted my money... Don't do the same mistake"
1,"Very bad, not a new one as described","The product I received was really bad. Charged it full the night before, and it would be dead next day in the afternoon. This doesn't seem to be a new battery as they described on the site. Be careful!"
2,I highly doubt this battery is new,"Bought what was advertised as a new battery and within 4 weeks it was going dead in a single day (without my even using it). It came in a clear plastic bag without any documentation or packaging that would have demonstrated its newness. I would have been better off keeping my previous 2-year-old battery, at least it lasted longer. Would not suggest buying this product."
4,Samsung OEM Battery,the item arrived on time and works perfectly. I was leary about the condition the item would arrive in and whether it was even the correct battery. So I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the item.
2,Very Disappointing,"I really enjoyed the first book, THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE, which covered the first two seasons of the X-Files. But this book only covers one season and the authors Lowry and Stegall want you to dish out another $15. Even the color photos have been seen a gillion times before in other magazines. Don't waste your money on such a blatant attempt by Rupert Murdoch's publishing company to milk this cow for all its worth. I usually enjoy Sarah Stegall's online reviews, but I can't believe she would be involved in such crass commercialism as this book. Shame on her, shame on the publisher, and shame on me for buying this crap"
5,The book was interesting to read but the pictures were dull.,"The book was great to read and the third season of X-Files was exciting.However,the pictures were stupid and all should have been in color.Whoever had the idea of printing those pictures in a dark black and white should think again.Next time when they begin making the 5th season guide book they should print nice, clear, bright pictures along with the episode synopsises."
4,Love this!,"For any fans of Human League or ABC or their members, this is a great walk through new wave history. Fascinating throughout and hilarious at times, the documentarian tells the story expertly. Highly recommended."
3,OUCH!!!,My ears really hurt.... uhmmm there is alot of really loud and constant noise.. and it hurt my ears... OUCH!!
1,i no like,"do not waste your money. if you like oval and his sorry excuse for music which essentially is 45 minutes of a skipping CD then you'll love this utter garbage. how, when, where and WHY!!!would you want to listen to this???? at least when autechre does noise there's some sort of structure and rhythm to it. hell even noisemeisters throbbing gristle made noise sound cool. this is a waste, a huge, huge waste of time, studio equipment, CDs and your money. steer clear of this. if people continue to buy this sort of stuff pretending it's the newest, latest, cutting edge of experimental electronic music, it'll only encourage more people to make stuff like this. please do the music world a favor, support real artists instead of charlatans looking to get some recognition for garbage any one of us could create. stop the insanity!"
3,"harsh, visual noise.","Using all sorts of studio effects and manipulation to control his distorted noise, Merzbow makes for an occasional interesting listen. I wouldn't exactly call this genius, but it's interesting. It's not good for clearing your head (I get extremely vivid imagery from this album) but if you're ever in the mood for having your head screwed with, listen to Venerology."
5,The Scales Have Fallen,"I thought I was jaded.I was raised on extreme free jazz like mother's milk. The first time I heard the Sex Pistols, I fell asleep. I started to find even old favourites like Shellac, Throbbing Gristle and NON overly lulling. In my search for More Pain, I gave Merzbow a listen.I no longer can consider myself jaded."
4,Memories from a noisehead,"This was the first all out noise CD I ever bought and, from all the other noise recordings I have now, I think this is a great intro to noise. Venereology is an extremely harsh recording; after listening to it, nothing will seem to compare. What catches me the most, though, is how layered the noise on this disc is. I still find new loops blending into the mix on the live track. I've since come into owning many other Merzbow recordings, and this is by far one of his best."
5,Gateway to the Merzbow catalog.,"I often refer to this album as the pan-ultimate MERZBOW album. It servers as a great entry point for anyone curious about the noise /avant-garde music. It you can handle and appreciate this release, you are in the glorious realm of Merzbow. There is only one artist that matches or even exceeds the harshness and intenstity of Merzbow, and that is WHITEHOUSE, which was a direct influence on Merzbow and continues to make the most extreme music ever recorded. Of course, listen first before you purchase!"
4,"yeah, its harsh.","i don't think this is the best noise album ever, quite frankly i prefer my noise to be a bit more arty and not entirely harsh for the hell of it, but how can you listen to noise and not enjoy a bit of merzbow from time to time? anyway, on to the good points, i always get these morbid visuals with this album, which may or may not be inspired by the art work (phalus..) but it works well one way or the other. the live track sounds very good too, very abrasive. maybe i should have gotten 1930, but its still a good record."
2,Champion Neoprene wrist/thumb support,I have frequent pain in my thumb joint and was excited to get this brace. I was however somewhat disappointed when it arrived. The Noeprene is very thin and brace itself is not as wide as it appears to be in photo. I would reccommend purchasing a brace with additional thickness and a wider wrap around hand and wrist.
4,4 Stars,"After two months of wearing a cast, this is just what I needed to protect my post surgery area while healing~thank you!"
2,Champion Neoprene Wrist/Thumb Support,"I found this wrap, while very cushy, to be very warm. Actually made my hand sweat! And I didn't feel like it gave me the support I needed to do the job. I returned this item 2 days after receiving it and trying it for 2 nights. I wouldn't suggest it. Its hard to wrap tight enough to make it effective, or maybe I ordered a size to big, but according to the measurement guidelines I ordered what I needed. Wouldn't buy this again."
1,Junk!,"I am a pediatric occupational therapist. This is by far the biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased. It fell apart within an hour of playing it. The ramp broke first, folloed by the netting. There is no skill to this game at all- it's luck, and frustrating for kids. I am a busy person...we all are. To spend the time to write a review on this toy tells you just how bad it is. Please take it off the market!"
1,Ok toy,"This toy is fun, but the netting doesn't stay in place. We finally had to tape it into place, I wonder how long it will stay taped though. Other than the netting, it is a pretty good toy. My son is four and he likes it, if they could just improve the durability a little."
1,Significant Liver Damage danger,This stuff is incredibly dangerous. I've pasted below a case report from a young woman who needed a liver transplant after taking usnic acid to lose weight. Want to lose weight? Skip the cup cakes.[...]
4,Surprisingly Good,"I purchased this CD before ROSFest and have truly enjoyed it. Great melodies with super harmonies. The vocals seem to shift between Yes and Chris Squire solo vocals, layered over a more driving melody than Yes would produce. I enjoyed the CD before seeing them and now look forward to their two new releases."
4,cool prog metal,good stuff but one question - it says keely schaefer guest stars .. is that the same guy from Atheist?
1,What a Waste!,"Save your money on this dog of a test guide and instead, check out the Magill Masterpieces of World Literature, ed. by Frank Magill. Well written, concise, pertinent, and more timely for what the test covers. Good luck."
2,Save your money,"As part of my preparation for taking the GRE Literature Subject Test, I bought this book, in addition to McMullen's ""Cracking the GRE Literature"" and the official ETS study guide. My advice: save your money and buy the latter two books, the ""Best Test Prep"" is nothing of the sort, providing no strategies for reviewing for the Test. Instead, the reader gets six exams that inaccurately reflect the questions most likely to appear on the test. Read the McMullen book or the ETS book for a better reflection of what the actual test will look like. The reading list, for all its prodigious length (seven pages) actually seems inadequate for reviewing for the test.I did, however, find the explanations for each question in the book useful and if nothing else, the book provides a wealth of questions and answers on English, American, and World Literature to supplement your study elsewhere. Borrow it from a friend rather than buying it."
1,The Worst Test Prep for the GRE,"I'm with many of the other reviewers: stick with the Princeton Review's test prep, and the Norton Anthologies. This book is trash. I'm infuriated that it's considered a valid study guide and continues to be published. Here's a sample practice test question:Which three elements best define Post-Modernism?a) Randomness, excess, discontinuityb) Flashback, fragmentation, humorc) Nature, faith, solidityd) Immorality, sense of loss, meaninglessnesse) Montage, metaphor, absurdityI was longing for an answer choice f) that might read ""One adjective from each of the above. A pastiche of the pre-existing choices.""The Research and Education Association lists a) as the correct answer. If you buy this book, you'll be answering questions that would never be asked on the GRE in English Literature, and you'll be scouring the answer choices for the incorrect answer that the slip-shod REA would call correct."
2,there's gotta be something better out there,"i have Kaplan and REA study guides to prep for the gre, and i have to say i am not in love with this guide. in terms of reading lists this is really thorough, but those are available onlone for free. so save the money, buy another version and good luck"
2,Get the Princeton Review book instead,"While the REA prep book is tempting due to its 6 practice exams (I have the 1997 print of the 1989 version), do not open this book unless and until you read the Princeton Review's Cracking the GRE Literature in English Subject Test. After reading the prep materials and taking the practice test in the PR, the REA is a strange land of confusion. It is somewhat mysterious where the practice questions come from in both books - PR talks to those who have taken the test, then makes up questions, apparently. REA seems to come up with questions all on their own. REA gives a daunting list of works to study and know, while PR breaks the canon into A, B and C lists, which is very helpful; and narrows works down to a single Name or Phrase that you will need to commit to memory. The reason I am not saying do NOT buy this book is that it's too tempting to give up a chance to look over that many questions; but it may have a dizzying effect on your study."
5,Diana's last great album,"I'm buying this CD to replace the LP I bought way back in 1984! I love this album, every track is worth a listen.""Missing You"", the tribute to Marvin Gaye, is the most recognizable track, and I think it hit #1 on the R&B; chart. ""Swept Away"" is upbeat and danceable, you can hear the influence of Darryl Hall. I also really enjoyed ""Telephone"", it's rather funky. ""Forever Young"", a torch song ballad, is a nice end to the album.Wow, this CD brings back memories. I agree with the other reviewer who said this was Diana's last great album. As a lifelong fan of Diana Ross, I readily admit it."
4,Swept Away nothing last forever,"Swept Away was Diana's last successful commercial release in the U.S. Swept Away was the beginning of the end of Diana's reign as the boss. All of You with Julio Iglesias was a beautiful ballard that fell short of the success of Endless Love. Swept Away was a powerful track that demonstrated that Ross could keep up with the other divas of the era like Chaka Khan, Evelyn King and Donna Summers. Diana's vocal performance was both passive and powerful and showed sex appeal and strength. Missing You was Ross' last hit and number 1 R&B ballad yet it struggled to maintain the number ten spot on the pop charts a sign that this was the beginning of the end. Other noticeble tracks include Telephone and Touch by Touch. Definitely the last album that was a complete masterpiece by Ross."
5,Excellent Magazine,"Of the few choices in pipes/tobacco magazines, this is the best. Well written, lots of good information for beginners, advanced smokers, and hobbyist alike. A great magazine."
4,Goofy Groove Grind,"If you took the bands Pungent Stench, Mortician and Macabre and combine them all together this is what you would come up with. Screeeaaaaaming vocals and the drummer is on some king of speeder. This is total groove grind but basically they made it in a funny way.Out of all the CD's I have heard I have never seen a CD that had eight intro's to it.YYEEAAHHYEAHAYEHAHYEHAYHEHAYAHAHAHA !!!!!Yeah that's what it's like but turn up the volume about 100% and picture that jamming in your head.Blood Duster is a good metal band and every album is different. Str8 Outta Northcote had way better music and more of a old school metal beat and groove to it. Some songs are long and some are short. Like 6 seconds of screaming then that's the end of the song.Good Cd, not for trendy ears!Blood Duster ~ 8 stars out of 10 stars"
2,No good,"If you want to buy an Exploited record, i strongly recommend you buy their early work before this album"
2,"Not bad, but not the best","The Exploited without a doubt have to be one of the legendary punk bands of the 80's. They have managed to chuck out a whole mess of awsome recordings from 1979 up until 1993. In my opinion the best Exploited material came from Punk's not dead, Troops,Let's Start a War, Horror epics, War Now, Death Before Dishonour, Jesus Is Dead and The Massacre. Not to say that Beat THe bastards is a terrible record(there are some good songs on it) but it doesn't measure up to the old stuff. The sound is too metally and Wattie Sounds like he's barking into the mic. In my opinion this record sounds more like a Pantera then the Exploited. My advice, Buy all the old albums first."
2,why did they make this album?,"this is by far one of their worst albums they have put out! alot of the songs are way too long! (a couple are 6minutes and 5 minutes! )if you want a real exploited album go find their older albums(punks not dead/horror epics,etc.)this is junk! thank god i didn't buy it(my girlfriend gave it to me)if the exploited are going to keep doing this they should just give up and retire(they hardly ever play the u.s. so they probally should retire cause us americans will never see them! )"
5,SONY DCR-TRV70,I have had this Camera for over a year now and found it to be reliable and its pictures of high quality. The Steady shot is rock solid and only jitters when you attempt >20 Zoom. The 120 zoom is grainy so I hardly use it. The memory stick for mpeg and still photos is very handy. The 2 megapixel resolution on the still photos is sufficient for computer display and small photo prints. It makes it convenient not to have to carry a second digital photo camera. I have not tried the Firewire link yet but the USB for memory stick operations works well.Overall I am happy with the camera and recommend it for purchase.
3,A Giant of the Early Times,"Jimmy Martin stands as one of the giants at the beginning of bluegrass music. But this CD of ""His Greatest Bluegrass Hits"", unfortunately is (for the most part) covers of other 'giants' bluegrass hits. They are decent renditions but recorded years ago and you can tell. This CD would be good for Martin's fans or fans of the history of the music. it does have a standout instrumental in ""Big Country"".All in all, not the best but not the worse."
4,Good Knife. Stylish.,"Zytel isn't bad stuff. It's a tough as any of my other knives. This blade is a monster compared to others. The only real downside is the quillion on the non-cutting edge side of the blade. It doesn't serve well as an effective hand slip guard. Rather, it serves to dig a hole into your finger if a slip should happen.Lack of serrations makes for good daily use as it is easily resharpened.Also very stylish. I like it in particular because it is reminiscent of an athame.Aside from the strangely placed quillion, this is a good knife to add to one's collection."
4,Pretty Funny !,"As an avid Whose Line? fan, I am pleased with this DVD.Though missing great games like ""World's Worst"" and too many special guests that didn't quite add a whole lot to the show, it delivers some genuine ""OMG"" moments.Recomendations to get this DVD."
4,Entertaining,"A fun DVD to watch with the whole family, keeps you smiling, our grandchilden reallyenjoyed watching it. It is a great DVD to watch more than one time"
2,Definitely not the best...,I was very disappointed with the shows selected for this DVD. Definitely not the best from what I remember when watching it on t.v.
3,"Who thought these were ""best""?","You can tell when a show's ratings are in trouble when the producers start hyping the guest stars over the series regulars. I'm old enough to remember when Orson Welles appeared on ""I Love Lucy,"" a singularly dreadful episode; in like fashion, shortly before it expired, ""Whose Line"" got David Hasselhoff to show up in his matching black leather jacket and pants. He is game to play, but just cannot keep up with the Stiles-Mochrie-Brady triumvirate. Okay, the Richard Simmons episode is funny, but for my money, I'd have much preferred the BEST OF THE BEST ""WHOSE LINE...?"" ARTISTS, not the best tries of impermanent TV celebrities."
5,hilarity,"Title says it all. If you loved the show, you'll love this. A nice collection of the funnier episodes... Colin is a comedy genius."
5,Hilarious,This show is just a joy to watch. And to have the classic episodes all on one disc is awesome. I wish this show was still on. I loved the British version and the American version.
5,put a mattress on the floor to catch you when you fall out of your chair,"I remember watching this live when it premiered. It was funny then, even though some of the comments were ""bleeped"" out. Now that I can hear everything, it is even funnier, albeit a bit racy at times. This group of comedians feeds off each other and ranges from funny to absolutely hilarious. You never know what is going to happen next because it is all ad lib. if you are offended by occasional profanity and suggestive remarks, it may be better to avoid this. However, on the other hand, if you simply want to guffaw and have a great time, this is for you!"
3,"Is good, but is not the BEST","The first disc is really funny, but the Second one is just decent, is not really the best.I have to ask, why is not included the show 425 with the famous joke of ""The Food Becomes poo""? This is one of the most funny episodes and is not included on the Dvd."
5,So funny!,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is obsessed with ""who's line""and he loved this. I thought it was going to be the greatest clipsfrom all the seasons, but it was the best/funniest episodes instead,which was ok."
5,a pleasure to read !,An excellent book that goes through all pro's and contra's that a meteor or asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Still Powell gives me the impression that he doesn't gives the contra's enough credit ! (but still I am a believer!)
2,"Great frame, but don't buy this kit","This Kodak frame is great, but the premium being charged for the accessory kit is insane. Buy the frame separately, save over one hundred bucks right here on Amazon. All the accessory kit gets you is a 512 MB card and a cleaning cloth."
4,Slides around but the speaker is useful,"I agree that this unit will not stay well on a slick dashboard like my Acura has. I have to put it in the center console, which is a bit bad because I look down at it while driving. However, the loudness of the speaker is useful. I wish there were a windshield mount with a speaker/charger. No elegant solutions yet that I've seen. Well made but mine just broke after about 3 or 4 years of pretty heavy use."
4,Review of Garmin Auto Nav Kit,"This is very nice kit to have in the car because it provides audio assisted directions but the knob that goes into the cigarette lighter is not hardy. It is relatively easy to break it if you push it to hard. Unfortunately, this is the only kit available for the IQue PDA so we don't have much of a choice!"
4,Ique Navigation kit,"The navigation kit works well although you do need a mostly flat area to set it on. Our Toyota Highlander lacks enough room between the windsheild and the dash to set it up on top, but we placed it below the gear shift on the center console and it worked quite well. The Ique was able to hold signels with no problem. I think the suction base might be a better solution for cars with out a low flat dash area."
3,Could be better,"I bought this to replace a broken unit. I've had the Ique for 4 years and my only gripe (are you listening Garmin?)is the bulkiness. Also, it doesn't stick that well to the dashboard. Hard acceleration causes the unit to come flying onto my lap or the passenger seat."
2,Just does not stay.,"I purchased the navigation kit but found that when driving a bit sporty, the kit does not stay on the dashboard at all, landed on the floor each time. Eventually placed it on the center console but that is not the right spot to look at the iQue 3600.Bought the windshield suction cup and found that that works 100 times better than this navigation kit.Unless, you have a flat dash board and do the 0-60 mph in about a minute or more, don't buy this kit but go for the suction cup."
3,Funny design,"This gadget is sort of a four-lobed bean-bag with a sticky, rubbery material on the bottom. It doesn't move much on the dashboard, but I wonder if it should even be there.The instructions are pretty emphatic that you shouldn't put the device in your line-of-sight and it shouldn't rest on an airbag. That would banish it from my Ford Focus and limits it's place in my Honda Odyssey. I'd have preferred something that stuck to the windshield with suction cups, like a radar detector.The device and the mounting base the iQue 3600 sits in are bulky. I've used mine on business trips and it takes up more space in my carry-on than I think it should.The mounting bracket that holds the PDA has a couple of screws that allow you to adjust the bracket so you can turn the screen towards you and place it at a convenient angle. I lost one of the screws in a rental car and can't get help from Garmin to replace it. If you buy one of these, watch out for the pieces."
4,Works Great,"Aside from a major collision, it will stay where you put it. Only problem is viewing the screen up on top of the dash. Too much glare, except at night. Am thinking of an external antenna, but that's another 60 to 90 bucks. Otherwise, wonderful."
5,You really do need this if you have the IQue 3600,"The friction mount makes it easy to use my IQue in the car. It keeps the screen in easy view, and the speaker on the plug makes it easy to hear the turn by turn directions. I am very glad I invested in the auto navigation kit.It does work best on a flat dash board. The dash in our suburban slopes away toward the windshield, so you have to turn the GPS sideways to keep the antenna from hitting the windshield. My sedan has a flatter dash and it works perfectly.You will be able to locate the unit pretty much any place on the dash where you can stand a coke can."
1,What is this junk!,"Witchouse II:Bloodcoven.Don't let this movie fool you.This is a terrible movie that doesn't deliver horror just stupidity.If you want a great horror movie get the Exorcist, stay away from this.Full Moon Pictures has made better than this.When Full Moon entered 2000 there geat quality movies started to get stupid and then terrible.Witchouse 2 is one of those terrible movies.In the early and later 90's Full Moon Pictures made excellent horror and sci-fi movies.Now that legacy of excellent movies is dead.Let's just hope a better movies are made or they might be out of bussiness!The first Witchouse is pretty good.Even with 3 stars it so much better than this junk.There is a Witchouse 3 but it is hard to find.... doesn't have it...yet.Overall this movie is a waste of time, money, and space.This isn't worth the 10 or 15 bucks.I would only pay 10 cents for this movie.Rent it first or else 10 or 15 bucks goes down the drain."
3,witchouse 2-blood coven,Full moon does it again. this movie starts out like blair witch with people in the woods with a camcorder. It takes a while for the movie to get going but when it does its good. The monsters look good for full moon and the story plays out well in the end. This movie does not have much to do with the first witchouse so if you have not seen the first one no big deal.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I am a fan of Full moon Pictures and when I heard of Witchouse II I thought to myself I must see it!But I was wrong.Witchouse II offers no screams,chills and thrills.This movie is a waste of time and money."
3,"Massacre of Music, in a good way","The Massacre by The Exploited starts off with a bombsell of thrash noise and doesn't really ever let up. This is one of my favorite Exploited albums. It's more ""metal"" than ""punk"" if you like labels and categories. The music is FAST. Not every song is good but most are; I'd say 9/12. If you want to hear ""newer"" Exploited to compare to the old oi stuff, check this CD out. Standout tracks: The Massacre, Porno Slut, Don't Pay The Poll Tax."
4,"good, but not their best","""the massacre"" came out when the exploited went speed metal pretty much all the way. The lyrics are standard exploited lyrics, the attitude is the same, but the one thing that makes this cd kinda suck is the solos. Otherwise its great."
5,A must-have for every family!,"I am a single mother of two boys; I am so pleased to have finally found a book that will help me to keep them healthy and at the same time focus on my own decade and my own maladies. As a single mom, it's hard not to squander money on unneccessary doctor's visits or tests simply because we don't know what is wrong with our children. Who knew that a daily spoon of honey coul keep your allergies away! This book pinpoints exactly what I need to do and when I need to do it. This will become my healthcare Bible; I recommend this book to families, but feel it is priceless for single parent households to own."
3,Good but shallow,"Neat stuff, if you have kids, to check on age related health issues to be aware of. Most of the adult stuff is real shallow and you most likely know about it already....wait for paperback."
2,Consider what you're wanting from this book . . . .,"I have a young family with small children and was looking to this book for some key things that we could do in this stage of our lives to make sure we are on top of preventitive health. I ended up reading the whole thing hoping I would find some helpful things in it that would really stand out, but it was just kind of one of those reviews of things you kind of already know. Like, sleep is important and good-type stuff. The main disappointment I had was that, although common ailments for certain decades of life are presented, there wasn't much preventative health information and the author seems pretty supportive of modern medicine. That is to say, perhaps too much, with not enough emphasis on other methods of treatment or prevention. I think I will look more into Dr. Weil's 8 Weeks to Optimum Health or Solve it With Supplements!"
2,Poor sound - plain and simple,"I purchased these headphones on the strength of several reviews stating that the sound quality was very good - the noise cancelling was not part of my purchasing decision. That being said, these are the first noise cancelling headphones I've ever really experimented with, and they're pretty good at that, with the amp turned on. Problem is, the dynamics of the sound itself bad. Everything sounds flat and, as another reviewer put it, muffled. I just wanted a good-sounding, comfortable set of cover-the-ear headphones for my zune and my computer, and I'm disappointed with this purchase."
2,Painful,"This is not the first noise-canceling headphones I have used or tried, soI can compare.The good.1) Ambient noise is blocked fairly well (however it is substituted with hiss noise from the speakers - see the bad, #2).2) Sound quality is not bad for the price.3) There is volume controlThe bad.1)They are very tight and heavy. My head is not big, but I could not stand them for more than 20 minutes, they gave me headache.2) There is very audible hiss in the speakers when the power is on.3) When you switch power on and off sound volume dramatically change. It is much louder with the power. This is not a major problem, but somewhat inconvenient.Overall, I can't use these headphones and returned them"
1,"Good sound, but they do not last long","I have owned two of these headphones. I returned the first ones b/c one side stopped working. I had my second pair past the warranty date, and the ear pieces have broken off either side (at separate times). They must be made out of a cheaper plastic."
2,OK sound quality but zero comfort,"Like other users have reported, the headphones are very tight and hurts your head after wearing them for some time. Bottom line you get what you pay for. And I am sure there are better ones in the market even for this price. Do not waste your money buying this product."
4,Good noise-canceling headphones,"This noise-canceling headphones work fine but does not produce the best noise-canceling headphones around. It cuts down the amount of noise in a flight, but still not enough."
3,Gold Beach good but flawed book,"This is a good overview of the landings on Gold Beach, 6 June 1944. However, after the opening, the book then focuses on the landing and inland assault of the 6th Battalion, The Green Howards, one of the 12 infantry battalions and three tank battalions with the British 50th Division that day. While this is a good close look at what this battalion of the Green Howards did on D-Day and immediately afterwords, there were 14 other battalions on Gold Beach which are not covered. I thought this made the book's title slightly misleading.There is an excellent, very detailed look at the pivotal battle of Villers-Bocage, which followed the Gold Beach landings and served as a climax to the initial phase of fighting. This is really well done, but might be better in a book by itself, and use the space to focus on some of the other units which actually fought on Gold Beach."
4,An exploration of the Iranian people.,"Forbis does a good job detailing the beliefs of the average Iranian and why the Shah lost his job. First and Foremost, he summarizes the history of the Iranian monarchy (2,500 years) and the Pahlavi dynasty (50 of those years). The Shah for all his good and bad are detailed here. The assessment of the Shah is fair. He made mistakes and deposited a fortune in his bank account. He also modernized Iran. Of note here, Ayatollah Khomeini rose in revolt when the Shah took over the hugh church estates and gave women the vote in 1963. Forbis takes a look at all aspects of society (religion, women, education, military, agriculture, industrialization) and tells us why the Shah fell. The aftermath is a society that is regressive and still suffers dictatorial rule (by mullahs rather than a Shah).This is an older book, so for current information you need to go elsewhere. However, this is good book to read to discover Iranian society at the time of the Shah."
4,Great Intro to Lacrosse,"This DVD is great for both coaches and players who want to learn basic skills in lacrosse. I have two sons ages 8 and 9, and we have watched this video multiple times together. I also plan on using many of the drills in my practices. U11 lacrosse is all about teaching skills and fundamentals. This DVD really helps in that regard. I highly recommend it.Karl ZacharConcord Carlisle Youth Lacrosse"
2,No value here at all,"If you are new to coaching lacrosse like me, you will be much better served by using youtube and the USLacrosse videos as your basic resources. For the price, this DVD offers very little. There is nothing here you that can not be obtained free somewhere else."
3,The Hereafter Gang,"I just finished my first Neal Barrett, Jr novel, The Hereafter Gang. It was a determined effort. While Mr. Barrett is witty and cynical, insiteful and irreverent, his writing style is difficult at best. Brilliant and difficult. I will read another of his novels, but not for a while. I need to relax after this effort and read something a bit more convential. But, I am glad I stuck with it and finished. I can't get one line out of my head: ""I heard a cat catch a leaf."" Brilliant stuff."
3,For the Mortician Fans Only,"As somewhat of a Mortician fan, I generally liked this EP. Like much of their other stuff, there's not much range... it's fairly repetitive. I did like the horror movie samples with the best track being Driller Killer. Be cautious however if you're not already a Mortician fan... this album may disappoint. Also, if you're not a fan of drum machine produced music, I would pass on this disc."
3,Enjoyable...,"A lot of people seem to have major conflicts with Mortician but I think they are one of the more ""fun"" death metal bands on the market today. Sure, the lyrics are cobbled together with various well known horror movie images and the the riffs don't shiver with that gothenburger melodic shine but the band is an example of pure ""crunch and burn"" death metal the ""way it once was"".The chunky riffs and horror movie lyrics fit a traditional death metal mold with simple, yet stunningly aggressive riffs creating the chaos around it. I personally love my death metal such as Nunslaughter and Flesheater so this fits perfectly in-between bands like this on my collection. This CD is heavy, armed with one of the most violent voices in death metal and fun as watching a good 80's Slasher flick.Pick it up..."
4,I like the death... Ilike the misery! I LIKE THIS WORLD!!!,"Mortician holds their title as being probably the hardest, heaviest death F###ing metal band to ever spawn from hell, but alot of people will pass this off as pointless, stressful noise. You really have to have an open ear (and a strong one at that!)To hear the music. Even the most die hard, satanic death metal, spawn frome fire sadist could easliy be crushed by morticians noise. This is a great album, but damnit is is hard to listen to. 1 of 10 of you will like it. I love it."
5,The soundtrack of your nightmares...,"First of all let me tell every one that mortician is a band that plays the most unforgiven and most horrofic type of horror/grind with deathmetal vocals that i've ever heard and it still gives me the chills. I just cant deny that powerfull effect that this band had on me and still does in every way...So, if you love your music unholy and dark? Then get mortician's "" house by the cemetary"" and you won't be letdown."
4,Sticks and re-sticks,"How much can really be said about them. Avery makes great labeling products. They even supply templates on their website for free. They print out perfectly on the sheet of badges every time. These specific name tags have just the right amount of stickiness to stay on, but can also be used a few times while still maintaining the stick."
5,Durable Labels,"These labels are the best I have found. The label numbers from Avery are in Office 2010 and they print like a charm. Will be using these labels for a family reunion. 160 to a pack, which is perfect. They stick well to clothing and do not curl during wear. Great labels!"
5,Works as Promised,"I attend a meeting every month where we sit in a circle. Invariably, most people write their name on their name tag in too-small,or too-thin print. It's impossible for most people to see from 10-feet away. So, what's the point? As the leader of the meeting, I could offer to write the names myself but there's never time. And anyway, my handwriting is not the best!Because many of the meeting attendees are regulars, I can print these out ahead of time in a big, bold font, with the name of our group in small print. Attendees enjoy having their names pre-printed, and I think the customized label promotes more feeling of belonging and being welcomed.Along with another reviewer, I appreciate that each badge can be separated without removing the backing paper.Prints fine, and black ink on bright white provides easy-reading contrast.Great product."
2,This Package A Lemon?,I bought these before and they were great! This time they were awful as the badges did not separate. I had to cut everyone with a scissor to get them apart. I don't know if they changed the product or if I just got a lemon of a package.
5,Another Great Avery Product,"We were very satisfied with the Avery Adhesive Name Badges. They have just the right amount of ""stick-to-it-ness"". It is often an issue with adhesive name badges as to whether they will be too sticky or not sticky enough. Just like other Avery products, they do a good job of providing you with ease of use... good directions and access to templates. With 160 per package, I do not have to repurchase as often either."
5,Every Event needs these!! Tried and tested and loved!,"I was very impressed with how these maintain despite rigorous wear.The first experiment I used them on was on my child, where I put one on her chest and sent her outside to play.Four hours later when she came in, the to was dirty and I could see she hadtake nit off on ppupose and with her dirty hands put it back on.The adhesive stayed strong.The second test was when I went to a conference. I used the brand they gave me, which wasn't even Avery and this brand.Avery's brand stayed on longer!I would recommend this product, tried and tested and loved!"
5,Versatile and easy to use.,"I needed some ""Hello"" labels for a non-profit function and chose these. I was really impressed with them. I used a laser printer with them and incorporated a logo as well as a name. The formatting was easy and they printed as they were formatted. The ink was clear and crisp with no bleeding. I found they were easy to remove from their backing and once removed and put on clothing--they stuck. There were no problems with the ""stickiness"" leaving residue on the clothing. What more could you want? Easy to use, professional looking, and sticks to the clothing!"
5,Finally a name tag that stays stuck!,"If you're looking for nametags for your meeting or conference, these are the ones to buy. Unlike most name tags that tend to curl away from clothing, these are flexible and bend with clothing. They also seem to have a better adhesive than most nametags, but don't leave a residue behind on clothing. These labels can be separated with the backing left in tact for later adhesion, so they can be sorted alphabetically if needed. They are also the perfect size to use for larger address labels on large manilla envelopes. If you are into Artist Trading Cards, these are the perfect size to stick on the back with your personal information. Everything I wanted changed about labels, they got right with this one."
3,Lamp is much darker than photo,"This lamp is...adequate. The finish is much darker than the photo, as is the shade. The shade is cheaply made, with badly sewn seams that wrinkle (these show up as irregular, bunchy lines when the lamp is lit. Also, the cord on the short side."
4,Kickass Rock,"A relatively recent album of the new incarnation of legendary ""Mungo Jerry"", recorded in Germany, in Sauerland within few days: February 28 - March 2nd, 2003 exactly. Ray Dorset is not only alive, but still able to drag anyone from the grave and make him dance.. A perfect prove that the legacy of British hit-makers is kept alive and treasured in Germany (Ray Dorset recorded with ""Mungo Jerry Bluesband"": Michael Pohl on guitars/percussion, Klaus Wenske on bass guitar, Achim Patz on organ, piano. harp and, finally, Klaus Otto on drums). 13 tracks altogether, all favourites (one live - ""Open Up""), great leaflet. For a fan of ""Mungo Jerry"" and Ray Dorset it is a very good gift. Pergaps, it's not ""Electronically Tested""Electronically Tested, but still a nice album"
5,Skewdriver Pro Ratcheting Kit,This is a very useful screwdriver arrangement kit and comes in handy in many repair jobs. The ratcheting handle is very handy.
5,Greatest Screwdriver Ever,I own a lot of tools and about a dozen screwdriver sets. This is by far the coolest and most useful set I've ever bought. High quality materials and workmanship. If I lost it I would rush out and get another one.
5,Less complicated times.,"Biggles is a hero of the golden age of flight. Typical English Schoolboy reading material, his many adventures are set in the war years or just after and give a sense of simpler times when the good guys were really good and the bad guys always lost.Biggles Flies West stands out amongst these books because it is set on a desert island where Biggles wrecks his seaplane and maroons himself in true Robinson Crusoe style. There are jungles and pirates and even a gold dubloon or two.If you like uncomplicted adventure and like ripping yarns, you'll love Biggles."
3,Glimpse 1960's England,"Nice overly happy Cinderella story with virtually no plot. Glimpse of 1960's England, with fast moving dating scene and class distinction. Charlotte Rampling is brilliant but underrated."
4,a great movie - to enjoy again and again,"hadn't seen this film in years - except on late night tv - edited, commercials, etc. - really enjoyed it - had forgotten how funny/sad it was."
4,Sweet and touching search for love,"22-year old Georgina (Lynn Redgrave) is perky and funny and undeniably frumpy. She wishes she were more like her pretty (but self-centered) roommate (Charlotte Rampling) who's always being invited to parties and has a handsome boyfriend (Alan Bates). The only man who seems to want Georgy is her father's boss (James Mason), a rich and married older man who has ogled her for years.This is a sweet comedy/romance that lacks a real Prince Charming but does have a strong woman with a huge capacity to love. Georgy ends up with someone to devote her life to, though whether it is a happy ending is left to the viewer. The spirited theme song by the Seekers was a big hit when the movie came out in 1966; it reflects the happy-go-lucky mod attitude of London at that time. Redgrave is endearing as Georgy, Rampling is suitably shrewish, Bates is a cute cad, and Mason makes for an off-putting but convenient lecher.The movie is engaging, funny, and touching. Recommended."
3,"Quirky, Quirky, Quirky!","This movie is no stereotypic story of the ""ugly duckling"" being made over so she can get a boyfriend. The movie is actually quirky beyond words. Georgy herself is quirky beyond words. There are loads of laughs, as well as one of the most fabulous theme songs from the 1960's by the Seekers. Make sure you listen to the lyrics of the song at the end; they weren't on the released Seeker's hits; and they are bound to make you laugh!"
4,"Charming, offbeat, and unusual.","This movie was better than I remembered it (saw it as a child). James Mason is a delight, the scripting reasonably well handled with a few minor obscurities, and the actress who played Meredith delightfully convincing in the role. Lynn Redgrave was winning and funny; yet handled the dramatic moments with exquisite vulnerability appropriate to the moment. Very enjoyable."
1,Over one month and no item,I ordered this item on Aug. 16 it is now Sept. 19 and no kit. It is not very useful.
3,the sony mini disc player,"i recieved a sony mini disc player for christmas and really enjoyed it. it had great sound qualities, good battery life and,durible.the think that i disliked is sonic stage the program you use to add music. i sent at least an hour at the computer makeing one mini disc and trynig to figure out why it said there was no disc when there was.overall i like everythin about the player just not the program."
4,uncle blue's new boat,This is a fabulous children's book. The quality of the binding and pictures is not top-notch but still worth its price!
2,Cursing Jesus is the lowest of the low,I got this opened up the front page at the preview and right away the 8th word is cursing Jesus Christ my Saviour's name. I gave it one star for that and another for it might be a good read otherwise. But initial reaction is unimpressed and if this guy keeps it up I'm done with him for sure and Linda Evans.
4,"Jose Melendez, Classic Freestyle","I think this is a Great Album. It has all the great classic freestyle songs that you can groove too. Jose Melendez has mixed all of the songs on the album, so if the originals are what you are looking for this ones not for you.Also, they are pretty short samples for some of the songs. You may just be getting into a certain song to hear it cut/fade to the next track!All in all, excellent ablum!Cassius."
4,Good CD,"It is a good CD, with seamless mixing of the music. But be warned: this is not today's freestyle music. it's from the early 90's. Do not purchase this cd and expect it to be something it's not."
3,"Good Filter Cartridge, Now Made in China","We've been using these filters for years. They last about 4 months in our household, completely eliminate chlorine taste and odor, and are easy to replace. The flow gets a little slow as they near the end of their usefulness. They used to be made in the US, however, but are now made in China. I'm not extremely happy buying a water purifying product made in China, but that seems to be where most filters are now made. It still seems to work ok."
3,It Works...,Arrived out of the original box and was wrapped in bubble wrap.You would think something like a Water Filter would be a little more sterile.Who knows who handled it.
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE THEY MADE 9 YEARS AGO,The scooter you get will NOT BE like the one shown. The one shown is how the scooter USED TO LOOK!This is the second one for me. The first one I got 9 years ago and it had the 2 batteries in a plastic pod as shown in the picture and was weather proof. And I never had a problem with it; I just replaced the batteries as needed. There were no wires exposed. The one I got in March 2012 has the batteries in a canvas bag and the wires connecting the batteries to the motor come out of an opening in the bag and the connection to the motor wires that are exposed to the elements.Today I called for service on my one-year contract because the scooter just quit running. The batteries were good and all was all right until it suddenly quit just like that. And there is no power. The scooter is dead.
3,Decent quality for the price.,"This seemed to be a decent purchase for my daughter who wanted to learn to play. Unfortunately, it had to be repaired with in one week which cost $15. The nut (which was made of plastic) broke while her teacher was helping her tune the guitar. So far, we haven't had any more problems and she is enjoying learning to play."
3,A guitar for beginner indeed,Playable but buzzing on certain fret which can be very annoying. you probably look for another guitar once you learn how to play properly. However it does hold tune very well.
3,Stimulating read,"Amanda Quick is one of my favorite. But ""The Paid Companion"" is not as what I was hoping for. There is more suspence than romance here. I enjoyed it... Yet, I was left unsatisfied. I did not get the usual happy fix in the end. Great story telling, not enought romance!"
3,"""Slow at first""",This was my first Amanda Quick book. The beginning was a little slow. But it does pick up. It did keep my interest. But have read better. It will keep you entertained.Amanda Quick is not an author I will go looking for to read. OK if nothing else to read.
3,Not the best but OK,"Amanda Quick used to hold my imagination while I read her work but I admit this one left me feeling a little burned out. The story line is decent, paid companion to masquerade as wife...but I see Quick leaving out some details that I wanted. This book is surface level as romances/mysteries go. Not enough description of people and places but lots of quick conversation. It did hold me enough to want to finish it and find out 'who done it' but I wasn't impressed overall."
2,In no way the best she's ever written,"I love Amanda Quick. Her books are among my all time favorites. But this one was not really worth the money- and I bought mine used. The beginning plot was great, the whole hire a fiancee bit. But the laser? Well. That was a little far fetched. And the bad guy, he just wasn't the kind of villain I like in my books, he was just an insane murderer. The plot connections were a little weak too. But, it is an Amanda Quick book, and does have some entertaining moments."
2,Just couldn't get into it.,"It wasn't that the writing wasn't superb, or that the characters were sloppily drawn but the only way I can describe this book is a long, slow, foghorn blast. EEEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. And I will leave it at that. Maybe borrow this one from a friend. If you want a mystery romance that really burns up the page but is also educated and well written read Samantha Saxon's The Lady Lies."
2,What's the big deal?,"The Paid Companion was the first book I've read by Amanda Quick and I was rather disappointed since I picked it up for the raving reviews its gotten, but it left me throughly unsatisfied. The love scenes are nice, not too raunchy or tame and the main characters are believable--to a point. But I don't understand how the heroine starts the book off saying that shes just been landed with the best luck ever compared to her peers--she gets to have guilt-free liasons and open a business of her own and basically make a new life for herself unlike other gentile women who must play the marriage game. Then the rest of the book she can't think, whine, sob or get over the fact that her employer/lover Arthur won't be marrying her! I get that she doesn't want to be parted from him, but does marriage have to be the end all be all?"
3,Not like her earlier books,"Elenora Lodge is in need of a job. Arthur Lancaster,the Earl of St.Merryn is in need of a fiancee. So the two strike a bargin. Elenora will get all of the perks of being St. Merryn's wife to be and Arthur will not have to worry about mama's with weddings on thier minds hunting him. Arthur is killer and even though he does not plan it Elenora will be the middle of it.""The Paid Companion"" is the first book I have read by Amanda Quick in a very long and I have a notice a big change in the writing. Like many other writer Ms. Quick has made the mystery the main part of her story. In Ms.Quick earlier books, the romance was the main story and the mystery was the second part. To be honest, her earlier works were better."
5,The Paid Companion,Amanda Quick is always a good read. I keep track when a new book will be publishes and order it.
3,Just an okay read,"Miss Elenora Lodge's step-father used her inheritance to invest in a risky business scheme. When the scheme failed, her step-father died and Elenora was turned out of her home. She becomes a companion, hoping to save enough money to someday open her own business.Enter Arthur Lancaster, Earl of St. Merryn, head of his extended family and fine strategic thinker. Arthur, determined to find the murderer of his great uncle, hires Elenora to be his pretend fiancee so the ton won't realize he's investigating the murder. Yeah, it's weak; it's light and fluffy. These characters are a typical Quick heroine and hero."
2,"The first dumb ""Lord""","""The Paid Companion"" started off brilliant and I couldn't put the book down! I was instantly connected to Elenora; ""Miss Lodge"", and really did like the Earl of St. Merryn. They were both tough and attractive in their own right and the chemistry was off the charts... then Lord St. Merryn opened his mouth. I am still clueless on what the author was thinking as she brainstormed this character and his storyline. Not once in all the years I've been seriously reading historical romances have I came across a ""Lord"" so...dumb? He was supposed to be brilliant, but as his secret mystery plays out it's Elenora who actually solves everything. I don't know, like I said the novel started out at a 5 Star and all of a sudden it changed, and I was fairly disappointed. Amanda Quick didn't give Elenora the knight and shining armor she deserved."
4,A fun read,"This book is in a similar vein to all the other Amanda Quicks (harsh, overbearing man who has to learn to love) but it's still a good way to while away a half day. Elenora Lodge is a charming character, perhaps more worldly-wise and less irritating than some of Amanda Quick's other heroines. I was less keen on Arthur, the Earl St Merryn, but it's still a good book. The suspense/murder part seems rather tacked on, but it's a worthwhile read."
2,Save your money !,This book is set in London back in the early 1800's when an Earl hires a `companion' to play his fiancé so he can solve a murder. The storyline of the murder is disconnected and unbeleiveable. If you are looking for a romance/mystery I would buy A Loving Scoundrel by Johanna Lindsey and save your money on this one.
4,great book,"I am such a sucker for these books... i can't help i love it when you have 2 people who aren't looking for love and barely even believe it exist and then they get all mixed up in some scheme and sparks fly that they just can't help but be attracted to... it was wonderful... and of course it's Quick so you know there's plenty of scheming, murder, and a little alchemy to keep you on the edge of your seat... i couldn't put it down... seriously her books are amazing..."
5,Being Paid to be the Girlfriend can Have Benefits and Dangers,"When an Earl pays you to be his companion to keep the women at bay, quite a few benefits come with it. You get to go to fancy parties, get beautiful dresses and jewelry, have the chance to fall in love and have a few romantic moments, and can join him in a mystery that can prove deadly. That is exactly what Elenora Lodge gets when she is asked to be the Earl's companion. He feels safe as she appears so ordinary. But put the lady into fancy clothes and get her hair done up right can make even the strongest of men weak. Now, the relationship is not so safe anymore.This is a great read that I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book if you like mystery and romance."
3,Combo Hero/Heroine a bit flat,"I had many expectations when I started to read this book. The plot is good but the characters and their interactions feel flat, without emotion, too clinical.I am struggling trying to finish this book. After this, I don't know if I should give any other of Amanda Quick's book a try. I am open to suggestions."
3,Something was missing,"Like her last few books, this book started out interesting and seemed like the author hurried up to finish the book at the end. First of all, this books' story line was somewhat similar to her last few books. Second, there was no depth story telling on how and when they started to love each other. Arthur just tells her that he was in love with her from the beginnig. But if you think about it, the book really did not describe it. Only thing we can do is accept his word for it. If this book is suppose to be a romance suspense, there should have been some romance side described in it as well. Mystery suspense side was interesting though. However, romance side was not. I didn't get the feeling that they were ""in love"" as their conversation played out at the end. Above all, it was OK reading but not her best."
4,Good read. Too much formulaic plot.,This novel was the typical female meets male and they join forces to solve a crime mystery. Amanda Quick did put some steamy sex scenes and told a pretty good plot of a story. However it was too much a formula for five stars. Still recommended.
2,A Good Read,This was a good read but it started off kinda slow... I felt something was missing in the plot. This would have been a great short story.
4,her best in a while,"Elenora has lost her home and her inheritance due to her stepfather and his bad investment. She also looses her fortune hunting fiance. Instead of depressing her too greatly, she sees this as a sort of freedom. She has no one to take care of but herself. So she sets out to make some money as a paid companion.Arthur Lancaster, Earl of St. Merryn has several problems. One is that he needs to go about society without the hassel of mothers trying to push their daughters into marriage with him. With this in mind he hires a companion to pose as his fiance.She needs the money and in the end genuinely wants to help him as he has a mystery to solve. And though he comes off somewhat cool to begin with - I really loved the lead character's sense of humor.The secondary characters were good - though this author has written better - Bad guys were all bad, friends were all good - no real suspense to it. A simple romance story with strong leads.A good summer read."
2,"slipshod editing, uneven scholarship","Although an excellent broad approach to Chinese symbolism, the reader is subjected to horrific type layout issues, with a myriad of misplaced hyphens making each page a veritable minefield of visual assault.To make matters worse, the author is wonderfully detailed on some subjects, and then worse than cursory on others.And for some reason, we're subjected to handwritten Chinese characters. Surely this book needs a major overhaul."
5,"A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols, or What is Still and Will be Hidden","The book contains 332 pages, approximately 400 symbols with Pinyin but without tones--surprise! At least, no experiments with romanization.The most beautiful symbols are those I Ching had been written. The most mystical thing is numbers belonging to every hexagram, 1-64. There are profusion of people, ideas, and things in our life we love and adore, but the code of I Ching is one bewitched me forever. This is a miracle. This book about Hidden Symbols in Chinese Life and Thought is really as open as possible but one sequence of symbols (I Ching code) IS still hidden for readers in any case. Believe or not -- not for me.Enormous illustrations help us to understand what was hidden in words, explained symbols help us to see what was hidden in life, but I never was sure there is something in words or symbols helping understand hidden in thought. Let it be hidden, let it be another miracle in another millennium."
4,Very nice encyclopedic approach,"Finding this in the library today, as a life-long (well, 20 years now) student of the Chinese characters I think this book is really well done -- I really like how the author groups the various 4,5,8 etc. associated hanzi together into their cultural sets so you can see their interrelations. Heisig and/or Henshall's books will give you some of the same backstories but I like the depth and breadth of this work more.I just placed an order for it since I know I'll be wanting to reference this at my leisure.4 stars since I'd like to see more than 400 characters, and while the art is generally good the overall art design is somewhat lacking."
3,Background information source,this book is more for someone with some experience with Chinese who wishes for more background on some words and concepts.
4,Actually 4 and a half stars,"This album was vital in my discovery of Richard Thompson. I'd already acquired some Fairport and Richard and Linda LPs, and this gave a nice overview of Richard's work at that point. It also included quite a few precious nuggets that were previously unreleased. It still holds up as a nice 70 some minute compendium of Richard's earlier work. Later releases have rendered this less than essential, but it's still a great compilation, and there are several cuts on here that are still unique to this collection. If your a R.T. completist, you'll have to have it."
2,Not Worth Writing Home About,"There are a few interesting tunes here, but by and large, the fiddling, the bands and the recording quality leave a lot to be desired. I found this in a cut-out bin, and it was a great deal for $1.99, but there are a lot spicier generic fiddle albums out there."
3,You get what you pay for,"with this cheap and cheerful 'scope from Meade. I liked their 90-AZ-F model far more, but it's [$$$] more expensive and you have to purpose build a stable viewing platform out of red brick in order to use it, so as a compromise, the 60-AZ-D is a much better choice. For children wishing to spy on school friends two blocks down you can't go wrong with this. Does exactly what it says on the box - ""Warning - this product may contain nuts."""
5,hooks you immediatley,"i thought the book would just be a silly romance book.Actually, it was, but it was interesting and suspensful. I didn't putit down until i finished and then wanted to read the next boodin the series."
1,Ending ruined whole thing for me.,"This book was silly and cute, until the very end. The ""mystery"" that was discovered ruined an otherwise decent story. Why did Katherine Applegate bother trying to add a serious soap-opera type plot to an immature and fun book like this?!? I thought it sounded like a mindlessly fun read--1 girl chased by 3 very different guys. Guess what? It isn't. Really disappointing because Katherine Applegate also wrote a great novel: Listen to My Heart (Love Stories). On the other hand, if you like soap operas, you might really like this teen soap series"
5,June Dreams,I really enjoyed this book.. I have had it for a while and I never could find the continuations and then someone told me about amazon.com and I just had to have the other books. I have purchased them all at once on my credit card that is close to exceeding its limit. That's how good this book was. I totally left me wanting more info. I'm chewing fy fingernails waiting for my shipment. Summer is the greatest book that I have read in a while!
5,This is the best series I have ever read!!!!,"This is a great book how would you like to have three fine guys falling for you? I know I sure would like to have those fine guys Adam,Seth,and Diver.At first I wanted for Summer to stay with Adam up untill the second book I mean who wouldn't want a rich,cute,charming guy right? But then there is Seth who is aslo as cute and a really nice guy. Well anyway, everyone has to read this book and I'm sure they will love it just as I did"
5,"The best book I've ever read, with guys in it.","I read this book and it took my breath away, I wish I had all those guys hangin on me.I can't wait tell I can read July's Promise. This book is just to good."
1,don't waste your money,The main disappointment in this book is that most of the photos were in black and white and poor quality. The book is overpriced for the level of information given and useless photos. The books by Robert Runge run circles around this one- hands down!
2,Not Cook Ilustrated's recommended pan,"This is not Cook Illustrated's highly recommended pan. Not the description states 19 gauge aluminum, which is much thinner than the recommended 13 gauge aluminum pan. The best place to get these pans, according to the Amazon customer discussion on this topic, is from www.wasserstrom.com ($10.50). Based on Lincoln's website, the item number for the 13 gauge half size pan is 5314 (http://www.lincolnsmallwares.com/Prod_Detail2.cfm?id=74)."
2,MR BUGS GOES TO TOWN,"THIS HAS A NICE 1SHEET POSTER OF THE FILM...WAHT'S INSIDE?...WELL JUST AN AUTHORIZED BOOTLEG OF THE NTA-REPUBLIC VHS---THE ORIGINAL LASER DISC FROM REPUBLIC PICTS. THE ACTUAL RIGHT OWNER OF THIS FILM ITS MUCH MUCH BETTER...I DO NOT KNOW HOW AMAZON CAN OFFER THIS ""ILLEGAL"" PRINT UP FOR SALE."
1,Do not order from England,Well I guess I should have clicked on the information bar. If I had done that it would have told me that it was an area 2 DVD and that it would not play on American DVD players. But they sold it to me none the less. So now I have a DVD that I cannot play. It would be nice if that information was was not hidden in there sales ad. I will not order from England again.
2,Poor Quality Control,"Spark plug wires were identified to fit my 1993 Chevy 5.7L Silverado. This was more of a universal set. Good quality wires, but one wire was missing the boot on one end and the coil wire had a connector on one end that did not fit the coil. Had to modify to make it work."
3,All Balled Up,"Great Keith Green, BUT, how did the cuts get mislabeled? Put the album on my playlist and when listening a number of cuts are repeated - how??"
5,The World Should Wake Up,"If you want to have an understanding of how the Bush Administration is pushing their ongoing agenda/policy for globalization and corporatization of our world (with the help of a handful of elitists) this is a must read. What frightens me about the future of our world is that this book illustrates that those in power have no interest in the protection of the average person or our planet, it's about controlling resources, i.e. oil, water and food, using any method necessary,including military to further their own agenda...greed and power."
4,Plot Lives Up To Title,"Liberal presidential candidate Senator Charles Boyd seems to be pulling ahead of the incumbent. Japanese candidate for prime minister Yashiro Sato wants to bring a return to the nationalistic days of the past. He wants to rebuild the military. He orchestrates a huge conspiracy to ensure the defeat of Senator Boyd who he believes would oppose his plans. He enlists the support of the U.S. attorney general. The heros in the book are C.J. Cady a U.S. government attorney who is somewhat of a believable character and Maria Ferrari, a lawyer,who who is a key high level person running Senator Boyd's campaign. She was not quite a plausible character. Still, a lot of action and all in all not a bad read."
5,Just a great book.,"It gets you into the grit and dirt of Washington and does not let you go until the very end. Just a great book - move over Grisham, step aside Baldacci - Topol is here."
4,Dependable author does it again!,"In this installment of the Bed-and-Breakfast Mystery Series, Judith Flynn's patience is tested when Dagmar Chatsworth, a gossip columnist, takes up temporary residence at Hillside Manor. Her condescending attitude is bad enough, but her dog Rover destroys some property at the B & B and her nephew Freddie is a bore and a horrible flirt. Thinking she can leave her worries behind her, Judith accompanies her cousin Renie to a ski resort. Unfortunately Dagmar and her traveling companions also show up there! When one of them is murdered, Judith takes it upon herself to find the culprit. There is some speculation as to whether Dagmar was the intended victim, but Judith doesn't believe it. She persists in her investigation and comes to some false conclusions, but eventually finds the murderer. This is another entertaining and enjoyable ""cozy"" from Mary Daheim."
2,another unusual film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD version of the Film.This film, another by Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol is less disturbing than their previous release, ""Flesh for Frankenstein.""This film is also a loose adaptation of the book.Set in the 1920's or 30's Dracula is dying. To survive he must drink the blood of a virgin. He has become too notorious in Romania to approach any women and there are few virgins there. So he and his caregiver drive to Italy as they believe that there are more virgins there. He stays with a family that has 4 daughters, when asking some them if they are virgins, they lie and he becomes very sick from drinking their blood.The film has excellent music which deserves to be in a better film. The Criterion collection special features are sudio commentary by cast and crew. There is also an 11 minute slideshow of production and publicity photos backed with selections from the musical score."
5,My Favorite Horror Flick Bar None,"If you want a few good laughs, and like the 60's-ish style of campy pop culture, as in the then cutting edge Andy Warhol, this movie is a must. The more modern, ""serious"" versions of this movie, e.g., Tom Cruise, pale by comparison. But then, Tom Cruise is a film and social eyesore."
2,Bad but amusing...,"This film was amazingly bad, but was fun to watch with a group of people. I could definately see it on MST3K :) It was good for conversation. You should see what happens to the vampire when he drinks certain blood. I don't want to give away plot points, but the bad effects are truly amusing."
2,Campy Horror Film Falls Flat,"Even though originally titled, ""Andy Warhol's Dracula"", this film had very little to do with Andy Warhol. Udo Kier plays a count visitng Italy to satisfy his ""special diet"", i.e. ""virgin blood."" Though the royal family's daughters seem promising, Joe Dellesandro (who uses the Andy Warhol style of ""non acting"")is busy making them ineligible for the Count's requirements. The count's reaction to non virgin blood (in repeat scenes) has to be among the grossest scenes in film, next to the end of Pink Flamingos. Other than that, the movie wanders, the dialogue is dull, the political conflicts unnecesary (remember this was the 70's) and parts of it are closer to soft core porn or badly acted costume drama than horror. Though not as amazingly awful as ""Sins of the Fleshapoids"" or Ed Wood (who has a certain charm) Blood for Dracula will leave you scratching your head one moment and then turning it away from the screen the next."
2,A very laughable Dracula,"An X-rated Dracula...well, I just had to see it. It was remarkably tame though which caused it to be boring for the most part. It came across to me, however, as being quite hilarious at times. But its all unintentional. The premise is very questionable, the acting is etrotious, and the dialouge is inane and completly unbelievable. Kiers performance as the count is utterly rediculous. The most memorable scene was when the count's assistant was socializing with the locals in a tavern over a friendly game of ""do exactly what I do"" ? Ok then. This inexplicably ends up in a fist fight, but also riotous laughter from this viewer. This film also boasts an outragous climax where Dracula is decapitated. The violent effects are laughaby pretentious but also quite amusing. Its worth a look just for the laughs."
2,An X-rated Dracula !!!!!!!!!!,"Paul Morrisey and Andy Warhol make another film with gory dramajust like the 'Flesh for Frankenstien' that I have seen. CountDracula(Udo Kier)is never getting enough blood for him to liveso he can take care of his sister who is also ill from lowblood ""income""..."
5,A terrific terrible,"When I saw Warhols Frankenstein in the origianl 3-D (Still have the glasses) at the age of 15, snuck in. I was blown away. And now Blood For Dracula. This one is great too but in a suttle way. I was struck at how such an inexpensive film($340,000)could look and sound so good. The first thing I noticed was the great musical score, just loved it. And of course the photography was rich and handsome too. I knew this was a super cheesey film and boy was it great. If you know what you are getting into for 100 or so minutes then you will be delighted. But it is the accents that rule in this movie. Man I love this film. As a companion piece to Frankenstein it is grand. Great gore, soft core sex scenes and lots of butchered english dialogue make this one a keeper."
5,Great sponges,These sponges are used in our general chemistry labs to wipe the benches down after each session. They come packaged in twos and hold up well for the semester. Good value for your money. :}
1,Disappointed,"The Power Touch case is useless. The description states that there is room to store 4 books, but there is no extra pouch for the books so how is that possible? We purchased this for my daughter so she would have a place to keep all of her Power Touch equipment together. I plan on returning it and purchasing the Leap Pad backpack instead. We already own one of those backpacks (for our Leap Pad) so I know there is plenty of room in it for our Power Touch unit, books, and cartridges."
4,Eye Candy!,"I disagree with the other review. I think the book has some interesting ideas about collecting and/or displaying your collection. In particular, I was delighted by the ""color collections"". If you like collecting lots of different little things, the color idea in the book is a good one. The pictures are great, and it is a wonderful coffee table book."
3,Received in poor condition,I searched endlessly for a great wheelbarrow and this one seemed perfect. I was highly disappointed that it was shipped with the tray having a shipping label put on it and then just shipped. The tray arrived dented and without paint in many areas. There was even rust where the bare metal was obviously exposed to water. I couldn't believe that they didn't even try to wrap it a bit with shrink wrap or better yet put two pieces of cardboard on the top and botton and then shrink wrap the cardboard to the tray. I paid good money for this product and I just felt that the company didn't care what condition the product would be in when the customer would receive it.
4,my 2 cents,"When the 'packages' arrived, the UPS driver stated that he had ""never seen any item shipped in this manner""... (not a good thing?). That being said, all 3 pieces (tray, handles and nuts/bolts/wheel) arrived with the tray having a smallish dent in it. Not a problem since this is a wheelbarrow and will get more dents through time. My major complaint was in the assembly... it took me 1.5 hrs. Not an easy task with the minimalistic instructions that, without a picture, would most likely caused major headaches. I was glad to see that all the parts were correct and no scavenging was required. Once assembled, it does seem to be quite sturdy and should withstand many years of usage. I just wish there was a indication on Amazon noting the country of manufacture/assembly. I figured a name of UNION TOOLS would have meant USA, but it did not, it was made in China. I may have made a different purchase decision... or not. I rated this 4 stars as the assembly caused me minor grief."
2,Take a pass on this one,"The best thing about this Shania Twain album is the photo on the front of the CD case. She sings very well as usual, but the production is poor and the songs are mediocre. For a terrific Shania Twain album try ""Shania Twain's Greatest Hits."""
2,Just A Showcase Of Shania In Creation.,It Might not be A good Album but it definitely shows Shania's potential.
2,Shania's first album,Bought it just for fun. It's not all that great. But it was made years ago. It shows what Mutt was able to do to soften her sound make her more soulful.
3,Shania's Demos,"This album is made up of demo songs Shania recorded when she was younger. I think most of them were made in the late 80's, and the music reflects that time period. It's definitely more of a rock album. I didn't really hear any hints of country at all. The sound isn't as clear as it might be, but it's still an interesting addition to your CD collection if you like Shania or female rock from the 80's like Scandal or Heart."
2,Going in a Different Direction....,"in which I won't be following. Not only is this different, but it is just not very good. I doubt any of these songs will be a big hit. These songs just don't have the greatness of the ones from Shania's other albums. Sad day for music."
5,Replacing an old school book,I realy like this book as a reference guide. I design powertrain parts for medium and light duty trucks and passcars. I typically use the formulas in this book to evaluate new designs and patent ideas before a great deal time and money is put into the program just to find out that it wont work. It is a great resorce for the first look at structural integerity and fatiuge life before investing in FEA.
4,"Amusing and surprising, but don't look ahead!","I lost a lot of sleep because of this book.I got so caught up in the story, wanting to know if Lilly would meet her deadline, what would happen with her in-laws, if she would end up dying after all that... I stayed up hours after I crawled into bed each night.It is true that the ending makes you question why you read the book, but not because you find it a waste of time... You'll just have to see. My advice is to RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO PEEK AT THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS! After several days of making progress, I was only five chapters from the end, but hours after bedtime, and I peeked forward a couple chapters. It was intriguing, but I advise against peeking.I'm not the romance novel type, so this was a new experience for me, and it appealed to me much more than any of the others I've flipped through in my friends' collections.It's charming and funny, sexy and, sometimes, even inspirational."
1,Poor quality and non-existent customer support,"I bought this unit in January 2009 and within a few months the arm that lifts the icecubes into the basket snapped and broke. Shortly thereafter, the plastic portion holding the handle in the basket broke as well. Now, the only way I can get ice cubes out of it is to manually push them down from the prongs and use a utensil to reach in for the ice. Stuff breaks, I get it. When under warranty, I expect the manufacturer to step up to the plate and fix it.Danby has proven inaccessible and customer unfriendly. I've tried since Oct 2009 to get the replacement parts, only to get a runaround between Danby and its local repair shop that is over 30 miles away. No callbacks from repair shop despite many tries. Unfortunately, I think this unit is going to the recycler.If you're buying it, expect to keep it for a short term and hope you don't need support."
1,Back to ice cube trays.,Today I will be returning the second portable ice maker. The first one lasted about three months. The replacement did not work at all.
5,replaced unit,"First unit I received was Dead on Arrival. I called their support and was told to return the unit thru Amazon.Replaced the unit thru Amazon, and the second unit works absolutely fantastic, produces a large amount of ice in no time.Great unit has been working all winter, spring and summer with no issues.Don LGrafton, WI"
1,Worst ice maker ever,"My office purchsed this ice maker and it breaks constantly. Once you can find a company to work on it - not an easy task - the parts always have to be ordered and take three to four MONTHS to arrive. Really. It is the biggest waste of money ever. Sure, when it does work, it makes ice quickly but it is loud and clatters and is not worth the money or the aggravation! Ours has spent more time at the repair shop than making ice. Don't waste your time or money!"
1,Stopped working after 3 months.,"Our 5 person office bought this ice maker for our lunch room. Loved it for 3 months and then it crapped out. We had bought the 3 year warranty and called Danby, they said to call their local appliance dealer who prompty came and said he needed a part from Danby. Almost a year has gone by and no part (or ice). I think these small units just don't have enough life in them to justify the price. Better to get a small fridge with a freezer/auto icemaker if you've got the room, unfortunately we don't."
5,A fun and gripping read,"Willis takes you on a fascinating journey through the lives of Angela and Robin - lives lead separately but with startling similarities and coincidences. We read and share their joys, happiness, sorrows, insecurities, determinations, mistakes ... all in quiet anticipation. The main story unfolds mostly in chronological order spanning their lives from their childhood to a certain day in the future with events from that day interspersed in between. A well written book by a very talented author. I recommend reading over a quiet weekend so you won't have to decide between the book and your existing schedule!"
5,Much needed Practice!,"This fabulous book allows aspiring writers to get in that much needed practice. It has exercises for nearly every facet of your novel or fiction piece: opening lines, dialogue, character development. I was glad that the exercises can be used whether or not you have your own novel or piece of fiction in mind. I can say that these exercises are very stimulating and the student's examples from the workshops really highlight all of the possibilities."
3,Inspired creativy!,"After purchasing this book I was inspired to write a poem titled ""What If."" Wonderful mind jogger when blocked."
1,Insulting,"I have to disagree with the other reviewers on this book for two reasons: 1) I was able to go through, sentence by sentence and cut the first two chapters in half without losing ANY meaning (after that, I threw the book away, and I don't throw books away), and 2) the writers talk down to the ""novice writers"" they're writing to. Go to other writing books where the authors at least recognize we're all on the same journey as writers, and don't waste your time with this book."
4,Short and Sweet,"While I still find Stein's books on writing to be the utmost, Anne and Pamela have done a great job. If you don't have the patience to read through long paragraphs of 'technical' information, this book is for you. The short bursts of information get right to the point."
4,Good Ideas / Great Asides,"I got this book to for story ideas and to help in my writing.What I got was more!I enjoyed the ""asides"" the author made about certain other authors' writings and characters. Tasty bits of gossip. It was as if I were listening at a door to ""wicked yet tasteful"" descriptions of supposed published authors--who should be not published.In addition, the author gave great examples of story starts, and by reading them, I could dream up other story starts on my own.This is a great book if you are stuck in your writing, plus it is a good read on its own."
2,Not for advanced writers,"I bought this book hoping to find some new exercises that would help me expand my skills. But I found most of them too basic for my tastes. This book might be good for people who are just learning to flex their writing muscle. But for anyone who has been writing for a few years, don't bother."
5,This was Jefferson Starship at their best!!!,"This was absolutely the best Jefferson Starship rock & roll cd. It was combined, on one cd, some of the folk influences (Fading Lady Light, Lightning Rose) and intense rockers (Jane, Girl With The Hungry Eyes). This was a great balance between not enough production of some of the older cds and too much enhancement of the Starship. Freedom At Point Zero along with Modern Times are both amazing examples of rock and roll at its finest."
3,Jefferson Starship 2.0,"After both Marty Balin & Grace Slick left the band, it seemed they were doomed. Surprisingly they came back with a better effort than the previously release Earth on 1979's Freedom At Point Zero. Paul Kanter was the sole remnant left from the Airplane days and he rises to the occasion with some solid tracks including the great ""Girl With The Hungry Eyes"". Former Elvin Bishop Group singer Mickey Thomas assumes the bulk of the lead vocals and his presence helped push the group towards the arena rock sounds of Foreigner & Journey. Mr. Thomas' vocal prowess is on display on the albums best track and hit single ""Jane"". The album peaked at number 10 and showed that the band were indeed survivors."
3,rates 3 stars just based on jane and rock and roll,"good music, one of the last albums before mickey thomas grabbed complete control and turned them into top fourty fluff band"
2,Not nearly as good as I remembered it.,"This was the first new ""Jefferson"" album to come out after I discovered my love for the Airplane. At the time I was pretty excited about it, but hearing it again 25 years later was very disappointing. I do still like the Kantner anthems (particularly ""Lightning Rose""), but musically it's pretty dull - really just a collection of power chord songs. If you like that kind of thing, it's well done, and the songs are reasonably well-written, but one after another after another gets dull pretty quickly.Still, considerably better than what followed."
2,only worthwhile due to Paul Kantner's contribution,"Paul puts up a herculean effort here, almost saving this recording. Worht having just for his songs. With this recording, Craig had apparently gone to the dark side to try be a adolescent guitar god. The inclusion of Mickey Thomas to try to replace both Marty and Grace was devestating -- it sealed the sad fate of this band toward the worthless drivel it would produce in the future."
3,A couple diamonds in the rough.,"Overall, the album is slightly above average at best ... BUT, it does contain two superb songs ... ""Rock Music"" and "" The Girl With the Hungry Eyes"" ... both of which I play over & over again ... especially ""Hungry Eyes ... ""For any Starship fan, this album should be a must have ... but like with most of their work, it is quite listenable, but not great ... although Mickey Thomas's vocals are a strong point !"
1,Not The Best,"...And not to offend any of the people who enjoyed this show. I recently had the opportunity to sit down with seven of my friends to watch ""Ghost Stories"" and we all agreed the host did sound like he was telling ghost stories for children. The stories were interesting, and would have been more enjoyable had the host taken a less dramatic approach. I noticed some people took note of Karen's review - If you enjoyed ""Ghost Stories"" that is okay, but for the people who did not - that is okay too. Reviews are to inform, and not to offend. Buying any video is a risk, and we happen to agree with Karen's review. For those who enjoyed the show, the people who have the same critera for the paranormal as you should find your reviews just as helpful."
1,Narrator *REALLY* ruins this series,"I could not get past the narrator. The little chuckles and affected ""Dad telling a ghost story to three year olds"" narration is obnoxious beyond belief. There is far better material available."
2,Very Lame....nothing special.....avoid!!!,"The title held great aspirations, but upon viewing..it severely lets you down. Like other 'benign' reviews of this programme, it could have been great but is a whipped up 4 x ad break potential, terribly narrated with a cheesey voice that laughs at everything waste of time.Apart from his spooky tongue n'cheek laughter, they hit just about each scene with this gawd awful shrieking scream which was getting on my nerves even after the first story.They are 20--25 min episodes which are more a quick historic overview of whatever is deemed to be haunted... To tell you the truth, it may as well be the same friggin town they disuss in each episode. Boring and a waste of time. It wouldnt even scare a two year old.. Talk about disappointing...Will try and sell to some mupppet on Trademe to get my money back. Avoid at all costs"
2,Like Garmin Better,"Bought the Navman for $199.99 on Black Friday. This is our second GPS unit, our first is a Garmin i2. The Navman has a nice touch screen and is a good size for portability. However, functionally, we like the Garmin much better. Entered our home address 3 times and each time after powering off and back on the Navman changed our address number and added E before our street. There is no E for our loop. It didn't seem to be as accurate as the Garmin, the Navman said we arrived at our destination 3 houses before our home. A bigger concern was that the Navman told us to turn left from a main highway to a street that leads to our house which is not allowed. The Garmin properly navigated us to keep right and loop around so that we crossed the highway legally. Returned the Navman."
1,Won't honor warranty,"My Navman F20 broke 40 days after I bought it. The charger connection broke internally. I sent it to Navman for repair in accordance with their warranty, and Navman wants $149 to repair it, claiming, without explanation, that the repair is not covered by its warranty! How something so clearly a manufacturing defect not be covered by the warranty? I have never had such poor performance from such an expensive item. My advice, don't buy anything from Navman. They are dishonest."
3,not so wonderful,"My four year old daughter loves to dress up and has a bunch of dress up clothes. Admittedly, her grandma has spoiled her with some very nice dress up clothes, so she is used to soft, durable ones. This is pretty junky. It is very scratchy, so she wears a shirt under it, and it will fall apart after a few more playdates. She hasn't worn it but once since I gave it to her, but has her friends wear it when they come over (so she doesn't have to). Save your money and get a better one."
2,Former student retaliates,"As a child, I used Saxon from 6th grade to pre-algebra. I relate to another review that says there are just not enough examples to completely teach the student the way to use the math concepts it teaches. It teaches the main concept, yes, but then expects you to blindly be able to complete more complicated work later in the book without having actually shown you how to expand on the original concept. I found this series very confusing and found math in college to be much easier. Give your students a break and abandon this series. I know it is used a lot, but that does not mean it is good according to the students. There are SO many other choices for math that do not leave the student hanging out, alone in the vast universe of numerics."
5,Book in Great Condition!,Thanks so much for the fast delivery and excellent condition of the book. We will get much use out of it!
1,Algebra 1 Book not easy for me,"This Algebra 1 Book could have been written in many ways better. It doesn't seem to explain things well enough. The practice problems are easy, but when you get into the real homework, the problems are very hard. The answers in the back of the book aren't always right and don't show you how they got to the answer. And, as far as i am concerned, the people who wrote this book just looked the information up and copied it down, not really knowing how to teach the subject."
2,I am not a supporter of Saxon.,"....I preferred books that are written in chapter format. They are much easier to understand. I don't like the way Saxon used problem sets. There aren't enough practices for the lessons taught and too much problems from other lessons. I don't think that reviewing in such way is necessary, and I believe that it is better to give enough practices to the lessons that the students just learn."
1,algebra: made harder,"look, this is one of the most ridiculous books i have ever seen. total rip-off of the money i used to buy this. i mean, they don't really explain anything, and its impossible to study this by yourself and not with a tutor. then, the answer column in the back only gives out answers on the odd problems, and most of the answers aren't even simplified!the explanations on this book never makes any sense unless your an adult. they mae simple problems more complicated than they already are. throughout the book, they make simple problems (such as the distributive problems) ridicolously long and painstaking. if you are a not a child genius or a prodigy, i reccomend you not buying this book."
1,something u should read.,"this isn't a very reliable book to depend on to learn algebra with. especially without tutor or a parental advisor, but it on;y makes it worse. in my opinion, this book teaches so much useless things that it's too much to process in the book.there's no good reason to buy this book in order to learn more math. it makes no sense. the lessons jut go around and around, and there aren't enough examples to reassure you the equation you came up is right.take from a kid who actually HAS to learn and beneift from this da**ed book. take it from a non-adult who's mind can't process in the useless info. the book's letting in.don't buy this book unless you want to learn algebra: the hard way."
2,Horrible explanations,"This book is HORRIBLE! I would recommendAlgebra 1 (A Beka Book) 2nd Editionreadily over Saxon Algebra 1. The explanations in this book are terrible, and teens need colorful illustrations.........everything is black and white in this book. Abeka's books are LOADED with color and examples."
5,"Finally, a wonderful Math book!!","Couldn't be happier with this book. My 14 yr. old who has always struggled with math is gaining skills daily. The amount of repetition in the problem sets helps tremendously! After suffering through the ""Scott Foresman"" nightmarish math books, grade school - Jr. High, this book is a joy to teach my first year of homeschooling. Funny, some kids labled bad in math are actually more than proficient given the proper learning tools!"
1,A Students Review,"Ahhhhhh!Attack of the large, hardcover, algebraical, mathematical and downright wicked text book! If you happen to see this book in person, I suggest you turn and run as positively fast as you can... AWAY! If you don't, it will open up and suck you into it's very pages, bombarding you with polynomials and rectagular coordinate systems, not to mention the villianous cronies known as fractions, and their wicked counterparts, the simple geometric solids!I have warned you! Beware!"
4,Algebra 1,"This book is not evil. At my school this is the book we use and this book is meant to be taken in 9th grade (at my school). The reason It doesn't get 5 stars is because:We learn the lessons and then its like ""Oh yeah I get it""... later on in the book, they contort the questions from that lessons. When you go back to refresh your memory... it is like that problem never exsisted.DO NOT skip from the Math 87 book to Algebra 1. If you skip it will cost you later.The great thing about this book is that for the most part you can always go back and re-read. They also tell you where each problem comes from (lesson). I am saying nice things about this book even though I despise Algebra. That's saying something. If you are getting home schooled and you aren't good at math then I reccomend this book. If you are a math genius, you need Abeka books. They are challenging and colorful."
2,improve game,the game is great but i was hving trouble going back to where i left off---seems i had to start over---very frustrating
1,What a waste of Money!! I feel bad for my mother in law :(,"My motherinlaw and I are big fans of the CSI shows and she thought this would be a great christmas present for me. Boy did we get one pulled over on us. Just as everyone reviewed very, very, very, short. I fired up the discs and was amazed that everything was just like the show and to my avail did not end happily. We both beat the game 3 days after christmas and feel that Grissom should have killed us at the end of the game. Like everyone said good try but more was needed in game play. Call me when we can actually get started. Thank you nita for the gift it meant a lot."
4,Great game!! Just wish it was longer....,"Just got the game 2 days ago, I have been waiting on it and was not dissapointed by it at all except for one thing the game has only five cases which if you pick up the basics of the tools you use it can be breezed through fairly easily and quickly. I am finished with the game and wish there were more cases to solve, the graphics are great, to be able to use the actual tools and uncover secrets and put cases together was a blast, they made the game very realistic. Every character in the show is in the game and use their actual voices. If you like the show you will love the game, it is fun to play and will keep you thinking and mad trying to put clues together. I say get the game you will love it, if only it was longer I would not be writing this now but it is very well worth it."
3,CSI,I have not been able to play this game very much because I am stuck in the second crime and they do not have sufficient help to get me unstuck so consequently I have played it very little.
3,Not Worth the Money,"I Purchased this and While I Love CSI I did not love this game. It was too short, and it was for the most part too easy. I finshed this Game in 12 HOURS. Definately not worth the Money. It was entertaining enough, but I could have spent my money on Something else that was more worthwhile."
3,Underwhelming,"The graphics and sound are neat, but there's little or no repeat play value. It's too short and the only way to beat the game is to follow the ""right"" path."
3,Kinda boring,"This was an alright game, I'm a non-gamer though and found it rather boring and breezed through it in one day. (Its rated mature, but a 5 year old could get probably do it easily enough)The graphics are great, but I was hoping I would have to type my own questions, get my own evidence etc. and have clues available to me if I really got stuck. I lost alot of points because I would solve the crime too fast.. what up with that?"
4,Enjoyable yet quick,"You're the latest probie with Las Vegas Criminalistics, shoved right into the middle of things straight off the bat when Grissom gets a call on a murder vic in some sleazy off-Strip flophouse hotel. Each case pairs you up with a different member of the gang (all voiced by the original actors, with Greg in the lab, Dr. Robbins in the morgue, and Brass giving you legal help and good one-liners), ranging from murders to arson to kidnapping, some of which gel together at the end. I managed to tear through it in little over a weekend, partially because you don't need to amass all of the available evidence in each case to get an arrest--although getting all of it without asking for hints from your partner unlocks the complete inventory of preliminary character sketches and storyboard artwork. Still, I'm waiting on any expansion packs they may develop for it, as well as a CSI: MIAMI version of the game."
2,"Too simple, too short","It's not a bad game, though it is a bit boring. You won't find yourself over excited by anthing in this game, and the game harkens back to older games like The Gabriel Knight series and other click on things adventures by Seirra back in the early 90's. The scenery is a bit boring, and the use of the Quicktime technology looks dull and the animations are all stiff. There is hardly any movement in the game. Everything and everyone stays in the same location, and you can only zoom in on certain areas. The biggest problems are that the game is just way too simple, and way too short. It's not worth spending anyhing over $10.00 on this game, if you ask me. Spending $20, $30, or $40 dollars on this is a crime worth investigating."
3,"Great game, but too short and too easy","I'm gonna keep this one short - I guess I pretty much have to agree with other reviewers. Its a fun game, and refreshing change of pace from the usual computer game genres and you actually have to stop and think carefully through each case. The graphics, sound and design really puts you into the spirit of the TV series. In general its also well polished, although for some reason all the sound and half the graphics disappear from the final case (and this didnt seem to be fixed by the current patch). However you are only given 5 cases to solve, and though they are not blindingly obvious it doesnt take a huge amount of time to follow the clues and apprehend the suspects. All in all I probably finished the game in about 6 hours which is way too short for a full-price commercial game in my opinion. So overall, an original, enjoyable and well produced game that just stops way too soon."
3,NOT THE BEST,VERY EASY!!!!!!!!!! You also don't get to work with everybody at the same time. okay but don't get it.
2,promises much but delivers little,"too short, too easy. perfect for up to 12 yr olds but after that the mental jumps needed to solve anything are minimal. a pity"
1,I can't even play the game. It won't run on any computer,"I just got CSI for Christmas and I can't even play the game. The requirement is to have windows 98, or 2000. The CSI PC Game bombed on both of my computers. When I went to play the game it gave me an error message that its going to shut down. So now I can't even play it. If anybody has played the game before please help me out. How do I install the game for it to work right. Is there another requirement to meet. I meet all the requirements. How do I install the game right? I really want to play but I don't know what the problem is. My e-mail address is Jenart3@comcast.net. I would really appreciate it. Thank you very much."
3,It's OK,It was way too simplistic and too short. Wasn't very flexible - you had to find certain things and in a certain order. Fun premise - maybe next one will be better
3,Pleasing but look forward to improved version,"Absolutely love the show; was so excited to find the game. In fact, couldn't wait for Amazon to ship it but had to find it in a local store! Quite easy to load and fairly easy to play; in fact fairly easy to solve all the mysteries (although I have yet to solve them all with 100% of evidence located/analyzed).Disappointments include the fact that it is quite boring to go back and ""resolve"" a case to try for a better score on evidence location/analysis; nothing about the story changes so you repeat all you've done previously. Also, the hyped and promised extra materials they show you (dependent upon how well you solved the crime) is not noteworthy at all!The fun stuff is the terrific graphics and the fun in interacting with familiar characters (who look and sound quite good; my favorite is Brass - he's hilarious). The game is definitely worth a few hours of fun but unfortunately not hours and hours of fun."
3,CSI,"I was so excited when this game came out because I love the show. The graphics and voice overs are amazing. As for actual game play it was a little disappointing. First the three first crimes that you are to investigate are pretty easy. I thought that was ok since it is a new game and one needs to get used to what to look for. However, I felt there was no continuity in that logic when I played the fourth one. This jumped from being really easy to a brick wall in seconds. Also, I noticed that if you do not follow the games script to a tee, then you will not get a perfect score. I found this a little frustrating since everyone has different ways to figure things out. I would love to see another one of these games but hopefully next time the cases gradually get harder and there are different ways to get the same results. It was a good first edition."
2,Broke after 9 months,"After ~9 months of use, the handle snapped, making it useless. I don't recommend this clamp.It has the redeeming quality of being inexpensive, but I'd recommend to spend more and get a higher quality clamp if you want it to last."
2,Disapointed,"I thought when I was ordering this product it would be the full version and then when I got it, I was very diapointed to find out that it was basically a demo model with very few clip art pictures and other things to use. For my home computer I have the full version and like it very much, but I am disapointed in this product I ordered."
5,Can't go wrong with Lynn Erickson,Erickson does it again. Taking the right amount of suspense and the exact amount of romance to keep you wanting to read more... Ellie Kramer wants to prove her Dad's innocence of murder. She is on the trail of 2 policeman who she believes is guilty of murder. The murder of innocent women/girls and the murder of her Dad. She'll do anything to right this wrong and sleeping with her suspects is just the beginning. Enjoy...
2,Big Disappointment!!,"I agree with one of the other readers about this book being a let down. This was in my opinion not a great romantic suspense as stated by yet another reviewer. Where was the warmth and romance between Michael and Ellie? The concept was interesting, but the suspense was lacking. At some points the book did peek my interest only to loose me shortly after. Overall I was disappointed."
2,"Good sound, poor build quality","I've been a Fender fan but recently purchased a Les Paul Studio Deluxe and love it. I like the shorter scale and wanted a less expensive guitar to haul around. I thought this was a great deal - an American made Gibson for $500. But the build quality is so poor I'm considering a return. The fret edges are sharp, and the pickups aren't even installed properly. They're wrapped in shoddy electrical tape and just kind of stuck in there. They move around a lot. It sounds OK, but the pickup selector seems very cheap too, and I'm worried it won't last. I don't mind the cosmetics much - stripped down to bare bones. But it looks like it's just thrown together with absolutely no concern for quality. It's the poorest assembly I've seen on any guitar at any price - except maybe those $100 kits you see in music stores. Not recommended. Try an Epiphone maybe."
5,Faded Gibson SG Worn Brown,"This is a great electric guitar.Pros:You can hear it pretty well even when the guitar isn't plugged into an amp.Barre chords and other chords are easy to play on this guitar.Easy to get to the high frets due to the famous shape of the sg.Looks great.AC/DC's lead guitarist Angus Young plays the same style and brand.Cons:When standing with the guitar, the guitar's neck tends to want to lean downward.I suggest buying this guitar to anyone, even a beginning guitarist."
4,I love my SG(s) but....,"There's nothing too much wrong with SG's. They're thick and meaty. They look delicious. However, the newer, more mass produced guitars are having a lot of issues with necks that don't necessarily warp when considering them from a body to tuning pegs perspective. Where you really have to be careful is the neck running parallel to the frets. The never wood's shape is rarely perfectly uniform. Gibson suffers from this affliction as well. Also, after my purchase of this SG, I replaced the humbuckers with Lindy Fralin high output humbuckers. It went from a basic model Honda, to a top of the line Lexus. While you can't argue with any SG's base sound, the Fralins are the deal. I've already had people comment on how good the guitar sounds in comparison to my other SG."
4,My own Gibson . nice! (just some scratches),"Its an awesome guitar, it looks great, sounds really good. Im proud of my guitar. The only negative thing i want to say ... the pickguard have some scratches..."
4,Understanding Equine Lameness by Les Sellnow,"Did you ever wonder why in any pre-purchase exam why your Veterinarian does certain things to inspect a horse, it's legs, it's muscles, it's movement?A full explanation, with all of the answers to ""why"" in this brief, yet fully explained booklet.There is conformation ""dialog"" of the pros and cons to each conformation blemish, and to purchasing a horse with such, for each discipline. Are you looking at a horse that is cow hocked or base narrow or toeing in or strait in the shoulder? AND, if you purchase such a horse, will that horse be successful performing in the discipline in which you would like to use it, and remain sound?Les Sellnow explains the strengths and weaknesses per discipline of all conformation blemishes, as well as why lameness can occur in these particular horses.Read on and enjoy a great and brief reference that should be in every home that buys and sells horses."
3,Understanding Equine Lameness,I found this book interesting but not enough detail for what I needed it for
2,more like 2 1/2 stars,"This is like a ""Barnaby Jones"" episode, with a scene showing Reese Witherspoon's boobies tacked on(Thus the half-a-star bump). This scene will make viagra unnecessary for this movie's core demographic, on the day they view this movie."
3,I figured out the plot too fast...,"But I love Paul Newman. He can do no wrong. This is not a bad movie, but it could use a little more suspense, less buffoon from Giancarlo."
3,good acting but lacked spark and very easy to figure out.,It was a ok movie. I like Newman movies but this movie lacked punch and to me there was no mystery--------i figured it out in the first 30 minutes.
1,No Plot,Other than Reese Witherspoon's revealing scenes in the beginning of the movie the movie lacks any story that is worth watching!
1,Did they even read the novel before they made this?,"I don't know how you go from Bella, Edward and Jacob to a bunch of old people trying to solve a murder mystery, but the people who made this movie completely missed the point of Stephanie Meyer's novel. I was excited to see Reese Witherspoon, I thought she might make a tasty vampire treat, but after walking around naked she pretty much vanished. Next time, fewer old people and more vampires and werewolves please."
3,Terrific cast. That's all.,"There is a terrific cast here, and their acting is as good as usual. The story is good enough to keep you interested, but not really any better than a typical episode of some old detective show like the Rockford Files or Hart to Hart. It's not really about solving the crime from clues, but just Newman getting involved in murders and beat up, and I figured out who the real bad guy was right away. But if you're a fan of Paul Newman, Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, or James Garner, you'll get to see good acting by all of them. And even if you're not, you'll get to see both Sarandon and Reese Witherspoon naked in the same movie."
1,Defective DVDs! Do not purchase!,"ABC News Nightline Town Meeting on Wall Street and the Financial State of NY/Muppets (2 DVD set)This 2-disc set is defective from the original manufacturer. Part Two duplicates video from Part One, and the first half of the special is missing. This is not a random defect. It is the same with all the sets."
4,"Eh, ok","i'd say this is a good book, set up well, organized, lots of good information, went well into ancient forms of divination, i would have liked to see more about altar set up and less of ""ancient spells and formulas"" other than that i like it..will keep it..that's saying alot"
2,mispaged binding,"The bible itself with the restored names may be of value but its hard to see past the printing and binding errors of the book itself. For instance when you turn the page from pp247 in the book of Deuteronomy the back side (what should be pp248) is blank, and then the next page is labeled page 247 and it is a page out of the book of Philippians chapter one. Then you turn the page and on the back of the Philippians page it goes back to Deuteronomy. this also happens in the book of Joshua where a page from James is inserted. This is just what Ive seen so far, but its hard to take a translation seriously when they can't even bother printing and binding it correctly. That being said, a restored name bible is of great benefit, perhaps this isnt the one to get though if correct page orders are important to you."
2,Notebook RAM,"Upgraded from factory 256 mb to two sticks of this 256 mb ram. I did not see any difference in the performance in speed or with the amount of open windows. Could be the performance of the motherboard/processor, but I expected to see something different. I have upgraded many PC in the past, and a ram upgrade always shows a little performance change. This notebook was different. I should have given the computer away and purchased new."
2,NOT THE BEST SECOND SINGLE,This song really shouldn't have been released as a single.It has very little appeal...the first one had more and it was enough to get her album launched.This song is one of those songs that make the album sales drop....Still go buy the album there are way way better songs....
4,Pure pleasure for the soul,"""Something That is Deep Inside"" has a freshness in lyrics/vocals that is long overdue. The CD brings out a plethora of emotions/feelings that have been locked deep within for far too long. ""Bella Donna"" & ""I Must Be Gone Today"" are hauntingly erotic and beautiful. ""Je T'aime I Love You"" takes you on an untaunted emotional high. ""Soft Lights Sweet Music Satin Sheets"" urges you to feel the true love within. ""I Remember Christmas"" & ""It Must Be Christmas"" show the true meaning/closeness of Christmas...NO commercialism here. I truely recommend George's CD to all."
4,Outstanding chronicle of a U.S. Navy blunder,"This book tells the story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis and the tradgedy that befell its crew. Largely due to Navy blunders, the ship was sent out unescorted and was torpedoed by a Japanese sub. Many men were killed, not only in the initial attack but due to sharks. It was only sheer luck that a Navy plane happened to find the remainder of the crew. By that time, only about 300 men out of 1,200 survived the hellish experience. Trying to get a scapegoat for its own stupidity, the U.S. Navy court-martialed the captain of the ill-fated ship. This book is a great chronicle of a story so strange that Hollywood couldn't have come up with it. Read it and understand what it was like to go down on a ship and wonder if you'll ever be rescued."
2,Disappointed,"This book fails to deliver what could have been a riveting account of the tragedy of the USS Indianapolis. The writing is flat, numerous scenes and military references lack detail or explanation, and other passages are tedious and overloaded with superfluous information. First published in 1958, Abandon Ship! reads more like a straightforward recap than it does an engrossing account of one of our country's saddest military disasters. For a more interesting account of the sinking of the ship and its aftermath, try Fatal Voyage: The Sinking of the USS Indianapolis."
2,So So...,Got this today and started watching. I thought it was going to be a lot like the 'Mind's Eye' collection with futuristic cool spaceships and worlds to explore with super cool CGI graphics...but sorry to say it was not.This movie was like watching colorful ameoba's under the microscope...or looking thru a water droplet with funky colors or a blurry kaleidoscope. Everything looks close up...I guess it could be relaxing...but not really what I was looking for.
1,A TOTAL WASTE,"I WATCHED THE PREVIEW WHICH CONSISTED OF A MODERATED INTRO AND THOUGHT THIS SHOULD BE A GOOD SY-FY, COSMIC FLICK.BUT THE SAD TRUTH IS, UNLESS YOU AND SOME OF YOUR BUDS ARE GETTING HIGH, AND WANT TO ENJOY THE VISUAL ODDITIES, OR YOUR PSYCHOLOGIST HAS RECOMMENDED THIS FORM OF TRANQUIL, AUDIO-VISUAL, THEROPY, YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS ONE ON THE SHELF.WHAT YOU GET IS LOUD MUSIC, WITH A VERY ARTISTIC VISUALIZATION, THAT GOES ON AND ON AND ON.AND OH YEA THERE'S A MINITURE-MOCK SPACE SHIP THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS STUCK ON THE SCREEN, BUT LIKE I SAID YOU CAN BE THE JUDGE BUT SINCE THEY DO NOT RETURN YOUR MONEY; IF YOU'RE DISATISFIED WITH YOUR SELECTION.THE SUGGESTION HAS BEEN MADE TO GIVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PREVIEW, OF THE FILMS OFFERED, BUT I GUESS THE BAIT AND SWITCH PROGRAM WORKS TO BETTER GENERATE REVENUE."
5,Spellbinding mystery of a truth-seeker,"Janice Deaner has done it again. Like the superlative ""Where Blue Begins"", The Body Spoken is a spellbinding mystery combining individual truths with the broader social issues such as sexism and racism. It takes the reader on a fast-paced journey of Hemy Lourde's life as she begins a quest for revenge after her family is decimated by an explosion and ends with frightening self-discoveries which change her life forever. Written as two separate, yet interwoven stories, the novel unfolds over a cross-country train journey. A brilliant piece of literature which will haunt the reader for a long time!"
4,Very compelling,"'The Body Spoken' was extremely well written; it was one of the rare books that I couldn't wait to come home and read. It was definitely different than many of the books lately and I will be purchasing Ms. Deaner's first book. I do agree that the ""explanation"" for Hemy's odd life was a little too convenient and tidy, and appeared to be inserted almost as an afterthought. However, I still recommend this exquisitely written story."
4,"Nice product, lousy case","Nice product, did what it is supposed to. Good quality and easy to use. I run maintenance on apartments so it being compact and fitting into the van worked nicely. Only thing I'd fix on this is the case. It opens from the center and doesn't stand up on it's side because it is not square. It finally fell of the shelf and shattered so now I have a great tool and accessories in a box that is square!"
4,Works great,"Excellent product. The Bi-Metal makes for a product that lasts. Mandrels work well and cuts are clean.The carrying case is a nice feature, but I don't care for the locking mechanism on the cover. Minor item and does not affect use, but annoying enough to rate 4 instead of 5.Otherwise, they are great."
3,A Little Lackluster,"Like his other WWII espionage books (The Polish Officer, Dark Star), Red Gold brings the seediness and squalidness of spying to the fore. This entry takes place almost entirely within German occupied France in 1941 and picks up the story of former filmmaker Jean Casson where it left off at the end of The World At Night (which I have not read). This novel is shorter and choppier than his others, and suffers in comparison. The story of Casson's recruitment to to the resistance and subsequent attempt to be a liaison between Vichy officers and the Communist underground is somewhat desultory and fails to excite or capture the imagination. The book's strength lies in its capturing of the atmosphere of occupied Paris, rather than the actual story."
5,an excellent choice for a family Bible dictionary,"This is a very beautifully illustrated and interesting dictionary. It is so interesting in fact, that you don't really read it like a dictionary. Instead of just looking up different terms that you don't understand, you tend to read it like you would read a very interesting book that you leave on display on your coffee table for guests to peruse. It contains study guides for each book of the Bible, summaries, outlines, and gives the historical significance and impact of each book as well. It is written in a style that is very easy to understand so it is w"
5,Great Reference,This book is beautiful and very informative. I found a great deal of pertinent information and indepth research. The color plates in the book are fantastic. It has been a wonderful reference for teaching my Sunday School class. I highly recommend it to anyone searching for indepth information regarding the Bible. It shipped promptly in a nice box and arrived in good condition.
4,"Wow, what an interesting book!","Never much into action books, battles can be difficult to capture on the page. But this one held my attention at every word. Very interesting and romantic, I really enjoyed this book. WARNING: the characters tend to get hurt in this book a lot! There are no deus ex machina saviors, which is refreshing and unexpected coming from a sci-fi novel. Parallels to leading a Christian life are well drawn without being preachy."
2,Different Cover,I thought I would receive the most recent cover of this product. The book looked a little damaged as well. Thanks anyway.
5,Awesome read!!,This is an all time favorite of mine. Allegory mixed with fantasy and the truth of God's Word! Amazing story!
2,Not very good opening shot,"I did not like Arena. I have read some where that people didn't like how sensual the beginning was or something like that???? I must have missed that chapter totally. This book just isn't very good. It felt like a bad sci-fi channel movie...and you know how bad those can be. Even the allegory didn't fit. Now I know that's asking for trouble because only the author can tell you what he/she is trying to convey...but things were just confusing. If this is a Christian allegory, why do people need to pass through more than one gate/arch? That sounds more like gnosticsm and the movie 13th Floor.Pass on Arena and go to The Light of Eidon(her next book)"
3,Not quite there,"I enjoy this author, but not this book. The first half is pretty good. There are too many oddly named undeveloped characters. The world is dangerous, but then everyone is more or less walking around. Even with these issues, the first half is good. Then it gets unbelievable. The explaination why they are being abducted makes no sense. Yeah, I get it is an allegory, but it doesn't fit the world. These aliens have some amazing technology, but can't fix the exit door.I am surprised this has so many 5 star ratings."
5,thought provoking,"I really liked this book. The allegory was not obvious, so it kept me interested, wondering what represents what. This made for a very satisfying ending, when all (well, okay, almost all) of the pieces fit together. It's a great story, but the best thing about this book is that it made me think. I was still thinking about it weeks later. (Which is not the case with most of the novels I read.) Even though I read this book 4 years ago, it has stayed with me. It would be fun to read again, now that I know the ending. :)"
5,Arena is a deeply spiritual book that makes you think,"I first read Karen Hancock's Arena about eight years ago, a few years after it was first published. It knocked my socks off. The depth of spiritual wisdom focused on a walk with Christ combined with the likable, relatable main characters and a plot that is excellently paced to produce what is even today one of my favorite books. There is a certain amount of violence and sin but it is depicted in a fairly tasteful way. It is an important reminded that there IS sin in the world and it DOES affect people. Fiction which ignores this reality isn't worthy of attention. Karen Hancock's Arena, on the other hand, most definitely is."
5,The Album Cover Outfit,"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS WHAT KINDA OF OUTFIT WAS THAT? BUT LET'S GET TO THE MUSIC. DIANA ROSS HAS A GREAT VOICE, AND ON THIS ALUBUM IT SHOWS ON ALL THE TRACKS EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T GOOD.SOME OF MY FAVORITES ARE WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE IT HAS THAT VERT ENTERGERTIC BEAT, AND SWEET SURRENDER WAS A TIGHT SONG I WONDER WHY IT WASN'T REALEASED AS A SINGLE. MIRROR MIRROR WAS A GOOD SONG I LOVE THE OPENING LINE: MIRROR ON THE WALL YOU SAID YOU HAD THE ANSWERS TO IT ALL, MIRROR ON THE WALL YOU NEVER TOLD ME I'D TAKE A FALL MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL. EVEN THOUGH WORK THAT BODY IS AN OUTDADTED SONG IT STILL SOUNDS TIGHT WITH THAT TIGHT DRUMROLL AT THE BEGINING OF THE SONG. SO ALL THOSE OTHER REVIEWS YOU'VE READ ABOUT WORK THAT OVER EXAGERATE THE SONG IS NOT ALL THAT BAD. AGAIN DIANA ROSS IS AT HER BEST ON THE ALUBUM. BUT WHATS WITH THE ZEBRA OUTFIT."
3,IT WASN'T THAT BAD,"WHILE THIS DEBUT ON RCA WAS NOT ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE, THIS ALBUM OVER ALL WASN'T THAT BAD. AND UNLIKE OTHER REVIEWERS, I ACTUALLY LOVED ""WORK THAT BODY."" IT WAS KIND OF A NOVELTY NUMBER, BUT IS GREAT FOR DANCING AND ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD FOR WORKING OUT. I HAVE USED IT AS BACKGROUND MUSIC FOR MY AEROBICS ROUTINE."
1,Dreck!,"Why this atrocious album is still in print escapes all logic! Not recommended to any fan. Her first RCA album is purely an attempt at ""hipness"" and no more. She drains all charm from the title track and tackles her own songwritng on a couple of tracks. Songs like ""Work That Body"" remind us there are limits to songwriting talent. A plodding and boring failure."
1,WHY DO FOOLS BUY THIS!,"No doubt DIANA ROSS is an ICON of MUSIC, but this album was the beggining of the END. Fool was she to not record again with the producers of her superior DIANA album(Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards). Foolish is the one who say this an underrated album, fool was Miss Ross to promote a teenage oriented song as the leading single when she was already 40. To be fair MIRROR MIRROR is the highlight and only track that it's safe. Forget about this album, and if you ever hear WORK THAT BODY you will either cry for help, or laugh by the foolish lyricks, surely foolish people will fall for this downhill record, RCA producers were killing themselves after hearing this. Okay it sold Platinum....but that is stated by RIAA that certifies shipped copies to stores, but not how many actually been sold."
3,Nice to see this one is finally being released on DVD,"I originally saw Witchery when I was a kid (I guess this was around the time it was originally released.) Scared the crap out of me LOL Very creepy and atmospheric with the black and white scenes of the witch being chased by the puritans, not to mention the torture/murder scenes. (Wait and see what happens to Annie Ross's charecter.) This film stars Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff, which strikes me as wierd him being in such a low-budget film at the height of his career. And also with the German actress Hildegard Knef as the lady in black. I have been searching for this film for quite a while with no luck, thank goodness Shriek Show has finally decided to release it. Overall this is very good to be just another cheapie horror film, sure it is cliche with the standard picking off members of the cast deal, but with the imagery this turns out to be a horror film that is actually frightining."
3,TOTALLY FREAKED ME OUT!,"This is the only movie I have ever seen that literally gave me nightmares for months! I even tried to watch it again a few years later and about 5 minutes into it I had to turn it off because that ""Lady in Black"" just gave me the creeps. This movie is great if you like satanic rituals and want to be scared to death but DO NOT LET THE KIDS watch this one!"
2,Witchery movie,CASE WAS SPLIT IN 2 PIECES... This was a gift for a friend.. I bought her something else and kept the movie for myself
3,Out of Desperation,"Out of desperation I will buy this dvd. Unfourtuantly, it is only rated R. I saw this movie years ago as a child and it really crawled under my skin, that version was uncut. Although I have high expectations in seeing this movie once more I feel that the jucy scenes will be cencored, which blows. But maybe down the road they'll release the uncut version."
3,Bewitching,"Like another reviewer I saw this a long time ago on video. However I must be immune from being frightened, because this film wasn't particular scary.It has a group of people from David Hasselhof, a pregnant Linda Blair, the good-girl virgin Leslie (played by Leslie Cumming - who's only ever been in two films!), and a few others. They're killed in a variety of ways.However I bought this on DVD simply because of Leslie Cumming's breasts. No other reason. They're cute. She's cute. Her acting skills however were exceptionally limited. How she loses her cherry in this film is also interesting."
4,Good gate for the price,"Quick and easy to put up and take down (though the instructions are terrible, you need to figure it out yourself and once you do it is very straight-forward), low enough to easily step over. I wish it had adjustable pads to account for baseboards."
4,Perfectly fine gate,"I've been reading the Amazon gate reviews for a week, trying to find a pressure-mounted baby gate that doesn't fall apart, fall down, make loud noises, permit climbing, or induce injuries. But for every gate, at least one or two people make those complaints--so frustrating! I finally picked up this gate at a store because it looked un-climbable, had plenty of notches for sizing it to my doorway, and was cheap ($17 with a coupon). It works fine in my 30"" door: firm pressure and not at all hard to take up and down as needed. Contrary to the 1-star reviews, I don't think it's flimsy--what more were people expecting in this price range? The clear plastic panels are nicer looking than mesh, and my baby enjoys banging on them. Caveat: if you're thinking about keeping this gate up and stepping over it, consider your height. I'm 5'10"" and I'm already finding it a (small) nuisance. Still, after we try this one for a few more days, I expect I'll buy another."
1,awful!,We just needed a simple gate for our kitchen and thought this would be good. As soon as we got it we put it up. The gate is very cheaply built and not sturdy at all. Also the metal fasteners top that allow the gate to expand do not lay flush with the railing when in place. There is a lot of wiggle room that your child's finders can get caught in. Mine got caught in it while putting it up. I do not recommend this gate. Do not buy. We instead spent a little more and got the fabric gate. I highly recommend these.
2,Decent for light duty use,Decent item for light duty use. Has a little lever action to ensure a tight fit.
2,baby gates,"The gates I purchased fall apart very easily and it is very hard to get them on track and together again. But they do prevent a small dog or a small child from climbing over them, due to the way that they are made, which is why I purchased them to start with. I can't say that I recommend them though, because of them falling apart so easily."
2,Poor,"As soon as we took it out of the box, we put it back in and returned it. The product was very cheap. I can get a much better baby fence at Walmart for a less expensive price."
2,Good for ferrets and small door frames.,"This gate is nice because of the solid see through plastic but it's not sturdy at all. Do not trust it for children, especially not on stairs. In my standard size door frame it works ok to keep the puppy out of the kids room but on one notch it's too loose and the next size up it's so tight it makes the wood bow outward. I tried it on our front door which is bigger but not huge. Even though it was far from being toward it's max size it just wouldn't stay up. I like that it is short enough for 7 year old to step over. It would be good for small breed puppies and ferrets that won't chew up the wood."
5,Miracle Ferret Barrier!,This has been the only gate that has been effective in keeping my ferrets in or out of a room! The solid plastic panels keep crafty ferrets from climbing over it and does not leave enough space under it or on the sides for them to squeeze through. Would definitely reccomend for frustrated ferret parents!
4,Great for ferrets!,"I picked two of these up for my ferrets. At first I thought it was flimsy but realized quickly I wasn't using it properly. Once stuck in the doorway properly it was VERY stable. One of my ferrets is already chewing up the visible plastic on the sides. I'm not sure if it's good enough for dogs, but make sure you put it on properly. If it doesn't feel stable it probably isn't on right."
