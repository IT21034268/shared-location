1,Great for a little while - then terrible!,"I received a complete set of the Sango Nova Brown dishware as a wedding present three years ago. Our first couple of years with the product were great, but year three I have lost numerous plates & mugs to breaking. I think the first thing was the plate that just split down the middle while I was hand-washing it! I don't know if heat has something to do with the issue, but I've had two mug handles just snap off during the course of normal use. Actually after the most recent incident I had to take a trip to the urgent care to make sure I didn't need stitches after the mug broke in my hands and I got cut.So, not only does this product not stand the test of time, it can also be quite dangerous! Even if this hadn't happened I was going to buy new dinnerware since I was running low on everything (owing to breakage!), but now it absolutely won't be another Sango product.If you're only going to keep your dishes for 2 years then go for it! Otherwise, beware."
5,The perfect dinnerware,"I am very happy with this set of dinnerware. My last set had very small plates, bowls, etc. This set is not only beautiful but the size is perfect. The plates are large, the bowls actually hold cereal or soup without spilling, and the mugs are perfect for coffee or hot chocolate. Not like those little coffee cups most sets come with. If you want small dishes then this is not the set for you. But if you like quality, beauty, and space to serve your meals then this is absolutely the best set of dinnerware I have found for a quite reasonable price. I bought two sets to make a set for 8. They are fantastic."
3,Plates break down the middle!,"My wife and I got two four-place settings for our wedding almost a year and a half ago. Since then, we had a dinner plate split down the middle when it gently bumped into another plate in the drying rack in our sink. A salad plate split in half in the microwave. We also have at least one other dinner plate with a crack down the middle, though it hasn't broken yet. We got lots of extras for our set - salt and pepper shakers, ice cream bowls, etc. Tonight I was baking chicken drumsticks in our Sango blue lasagna dish and we heard a crack. When I went to pull the dish out of the oven, I discovered it, too, had split down the middle.I never thought to check out reviews on this set when we added it to our wedding registry. It's sold at nice stores like Bed, Bath, and Beyond and is certainly not the cheapest set out there. I've been disappointed with the lack of durability."
2,Not Sturdy,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews... these are gorgeous dishes, but they break and chip easily. Out of a set of 8, I have 2 salad plates left. All have broken rewarming an item in the microwave. Most of the plates and bowls have chips along the bottom rim. I am very dissapointed because I really loved the look of this set. I am currently shopping for something more sturdy."
1,Sending it back,Last year we bought an eight piece set and we noticed the plates were easily chipped. I thought it might be smart to buy some extra plates. I discovered that the only practical way to get plates was to buy another complete set. I ordered the complete set and it was a match as far as color and shape. Unfortunately the plates were about 1/2 inch larger in diameter than the plates from last year. They won't fit in the cupboard door so we are sending them back. Without a way to obtain addtitonal plates our investment with Sango Nova Brown dinnerware is doomed. I wish we'd never done business with them.
2,Most of it was unusable within a year.,"I had a set of these in blue for a while. They were heavy, fragile, and got very hot very fast in the microwave. After a year, so many of the bowls and plates were so chipped (from regular use and washing), we gave up and got Fiestaware instead. There's no point trying to save money on this stuff if you're just going to have to replace it that soon anyway."
1,Purchase something else,I've had the avocado dinnerware set for 3 years now. I've had 2 dinner plates and 3 of the salad plates crack while in the microwave. I can't seem to find a customer service number to see if the company will replace the plates.
4,A Mellow Groove,"More orchestated than what I thought Bossa Nova was, yet mellows down easy for happy hour."
5,Picture yourself on the beaches of Brazil...,"...sitting beneath a palm tree with the white sand beach reaching out to meet the sparkling, sapphire sea. The sun is beaming and you can see for miles across the ocean on this crystal clear day. There's a swinging jazz band nearby at the cabana playing latin rythyms peppered with clave ticks, and maraca shakes. Your name is Bond, James Bond, you tell yourself as you sip from a hollowed pineapple filled with a rum-fruit juice concoction. Even Doctor No would dig these ultra-cool tunes. You turn to see a tall, tan, young, lovely girl walking from the ocean towards you. Ahhh yes, saving the world can wait..."
2,A non-explosive set of bossa nova tunes,"While there are a few snappy tunes on this CD, I find this to be one of the weak sisters in this series of Lounge Music. A song like ""Misrilou,"" which should be played exotically and emphatically, is wasted when subjected to a low-key rendition such as you'll find here. Get this only if you are really hot for soft bossa nova,"
4,Ludicrously Mellow!!!,"You'll definatley find this CD suitable for play at the dentist office. The cover of ""Witchcraft"" is great, and you'll soon find rest of the album is full of great selections once you listened to it a couple of times."
1,Let down,I love bosa nova and brazilian music having discovered it on many a business trip to Rio. This disk is like brazilian muzak. No soul to it in my opinion.
5,So Swank!,This CD is one of my all time favorites. It transports you to a tropical paradise as soon as you put it on. You can imagine yourself becoming part of the Jet-Set crowd and hopping on your intercontinental delight flight to Rio. Perfect for drives up and down the coast or just relaxing with your hipster pals at the beach. Shake that martini and listen to the hi-fi sounds of the supersonic cool!
5,"One of the best in the ""Ultra Lounge"" series","This is by far one of the best in the ultra hip, ultra cool, ""Ultra Lounge"" series. For those of you who are new to the ""Ultra Lounge"" experience, thsi CD will take you back in time to the 1960's lounge era. This CD in particular has a very relaxing feel to it and although there are some songs that may sound a little cheezy compared to the true authentic bossa nova music from the pioneers like Joo & Astrud Gilberto or Antonio Carlos Jobim, it still delivers a good presentation of bossa nova inspired lounge songs. But some of the artists on this CD, such as Walter Wanderley, are in fact Brazilian. Finally, for those of you who are already familiar with the ""Ultra Lounge"" series, this is definitely one of the best in the entire series."
5,Excellent for the Strike Eagle Enthusiast,"Alternate title for this book - ""Everything You Want to Know About the Strike Eagle, but Were Afraid to Ask"".As an F-15E pilot, I was amazed at the amount of technical detail contained in the book. Davies practically walks you through every system in the aircraft and explains them from the ground up.Outstanding photography - nearly every page has a photo, some that are absolutely amazing.My favorite aspect of the book is the stories told by Strike Eagle aircrew interviewed by Davies. Included are some I had heard before and some I had not; combat missions into Iraq in Desert Storm, ONW and OIF, an F-15E air-to-air kill with a laser guided bomb, and a 15.5 hour sortie are just a few to name.This book is a great read for those who are F-15E fans, but the technical jargon could be a little confusing for the average Joe (though it comes with a full glossary to reference)."
3,Could be better.,"If your looking for COLOR reference photos of the F-15E Strike Eagle, this would not be my first choice. The entire book, except for a few profile and instrument shots (not many), are Black and White. That being said, the information is VERY useful and well written. The addition of color photos would make this book a 4 or 5 star contender."
5,Most comfortable solution,"I love my headset. I've had this thing about two months and I wear it around the yard for several hours a day. It is that comfortable. A little bulky on your head, but it gets rid of the cords associated with all the ear buds out there. A little more comfortable if you wear a ball cap. I use it doing yard work, taking the dog for a walk, etc. The sound isolating qualities are just average. Wind is a bit of a problem. If there is a constant breeze, there will be a lot of wind noise. Adjusting the phones doesn't seem to help. This is the only downside I've found.If you have a Sansa, you should have a set of these. This isn't a high end head set, but very good and very convenient and a good price. Worth every penny!"
2,MP3 Headset works great!!,"I bought this headset for when I mow (3 acres) & it works great!!! I hear it perfectly over the mower, etc... no cords or anything to get in your way!Also use for the eliptical & on airplanes ... very comfortable, good sound quality.couldn't be happier"
2,Horrible taste - not fresh - not Indian!!,"I bought this ready to eat Indian food expecting to re-kindle my home town memories - but I dont know what these people had in mind while cooking this lousy, bad tasting food. It smelt really odd and tasted even odder!! Where is Kohinoor??? Does no one on amazon know about this delicious ready to eat Indian Maharaja style cuisine? I had it just once and keep thinking about that authentic flavour.......!!"
4,Worked Great.,"This was a replacment for OEM with 100,000 miles on it, and it installed without any problems and works good opened at 190 degrees."
4,Solid Exegesis,"E. W. Hengstenberg wrote this commentary in the 1850s, too early to be caught up in J. N. Darby's Dispensational nonsense. (It is doubtful if Hengstenberg would have fallen for Dispensationalism even had he heard of it. He is too careful an exegete.) Although written over 150 years ago, this is far and away the best commentary on Revelation in print (how helpful of Wipf and Stock Publishers to reprint it!). Hengstenberg works from the Greek text of Revelation and comes to his task with a deep knowledge of both the Old and New Testaments. This knowledge of the Old Testament is essential for a proper understanding of Revelation. Hengstenberg is a godly evangelical Christian, not a dry, dusty academic. This two-volume set is worth every dollar of its price."
1,Not again!,"Too bad there isn't a ""zero"" star rating. I can't even finish the book as there are so many errors in the first 111 pages. It doesn't take a biblical scholar to figure out this guy is just plain old full of it. Somehow, my mother received two copies free of charge of this sad excuse for cutting down trees. Now these two copies are going ""ashes to ashes, dust to dust""...literally since we are burning the works of a heretic.It is unbelievable how many people believe this guys malarkey. I could pull a bunch of bible verses, draw my own conclusions and put them in a book. But that still wouldn't make me right.To see in print, Camping basically calling God and Jesus terrorists (pg. 15, 25) shows how stupid he is. Mankind has been given many opportunities to accept Christ as their saviour. If people don't, they shall suffer eternal damnation.I guess we are going to have to put up with people freaking out as 2011 draws near because they chose to believe a false prophet."
1,Deceived by Thiele,"Anyone who has studied Biblical chronology in depth will understand that all Biblical calendars must make contact with known secular history at some point, otherwise they cannot be assigned BC or AD dates. In Camping's case, he relied on Edwin Thiele's 931 BC date for the Schism, which itself was fixed by the Assyrian Eponym List. This list is not an infallible document, and the year of 931 for the Schism is rejected by many Biblicists, who favour Ussher's date of 975 (or dates close by) for the Schism. The bottom line is that 2011 is not a Biblically derived date. It is essentially a date worked out by projecting time-spans from a calendar that has been dated through the Assyrian Eponym List. Therefore, it is date of men, not of God. Reader beware."
1,Another False Prophecy,"People who believe in the 2012 nonsense are just a bunch of new age nuts,and have NOTHING to do with Christianity.But,as a so called ""Christian"", and ""Teacher"" of The Bible,you would think that Harold Camping would have know better then to come up with a prediction like this.God's Holy Word plainly says,that NO man will know the hour or the day.Not the angels in Heaven...not Jesus himself...ONLY THE FATHER GOD.(Matthew 24:36) Camping is just another crook who has lied to the gullible and convinced them of non-biblical deception.Camping and the so called 2012 ""end of the world"" will go down in history as huge scams and nothing more.Unfortunatly,many people have lost millions because of them."
1,"Another Nut spewing fear , hate and ignorance","Harold Camping is another crazed conservative fear and hate preacher spewing endtimes nonsense. This man actually predicted the world would come to an end in 1994 and he still has people who are as pathetic as himself, listening and following his rantings."
1,Beware of false prophets.,"I remember Harold Camping once claiming on Open Forum it was possible he was the second coming of the prophet Elijah. This was when he was convinced he knew the year, month, week, day, and hour of Christ's return...well, he was at least 99.99% sure. Keep in mind the Lord God states that prophecies based on Holy Scripture are 100% true. Anything less is a prophecy from a servant of Satan, an unsaved prophet of lies, otherwise known as a false prophet; which Harold Camping has revealed himself to be.If you're not convinced, ask yourself who's revealing the erroneous teaching Harold Camping preaches? Who revealed the year 1994? What's his name? Is it God?Harold Camping has come as an angel of light perverting God's Word to fit his evolving false prophecy. NEVER place a man's word over God's (""seek ye first the Kingdom of God,...""). Don't follow Harold Camping into Hell, where he will surely be with his master Satan."
1,Matthew 24:36,"""But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."""
1,He won't be proved wrong (this time around),"After years of warning against predicting dates for the Lord's return, Harold Caming (head of Family Radio, Inc.) went ahead and predicted that Jesus would return around September 5-27, 1994. After that date passed, his popularity with the staff of Family Radio nosedived and many called for his resignation.His idea is that Jesus said nobody would know the day or hour, but Camping thought we could at least know the month. He refused to resign.After the churches turned against him and his radio stations, he in turn declared the end of the church age and insisted that Christians should stop going to church. He claims God is now using radio instead of church to evangelize the world.Now he is calculating that Noah's flood occurred in 4990 BC, and that the Lord will return 7,000 years later, which is AD 2011.He's over 80, and probably won't live to see another failed date setting."
1,Luke 21:8,"""Watch out that you are not decieved. For many will come in my name claiming 'I am he' and 'THE TIME IS NEAR.' Do not follow them.""Self-explanitory. Harold Camping makes confident statements based on bad assumptions and wacky numerology instead of simply trusting the Word of God at face value.Here's a clear method: if you insist on trying to predict the day Jesus will come back, then you don't actually believe that what Jesus himself said is true."
4,Great material,"I bought this for my 15 Mth old. I will agree it is a perfect size for younger kids. It fits her well now. I can see it working well for a couple of years but not until she is 5 which is what I think I recall it being advertised for. I will need to cut the armband elastic as she grows though, it was already tight when we first put it on. I love the material. Feels like it should protect her well as well as clean up well."
5,A toddler must,"These bibs are always a must in my house... yes i know it is considered a smock but my boys are very tall so i use it as a bib,,, keeps all nasty food off the clothes and washes beautifully"
4,works well,"I bought this to do various activities with my toddler. He hasn't been too interested in painting, so, mostly we've just ""washed dishes"". Big pots of water in the sink and a bunch of non-breakable stuff. It kept him quite dry. I wish the closure in the back were a little better, like velcro instead of a tie."
4,Best bib,"Excellent bib for water play or messy eaters. It's light, flexible, doesn't have any PVC, and is easy to clean. It's almost as long as the ""super bib."" Not the cutest pattern, but others are available for a bit more money. If you just want one for mealtimes and don't need sleeves, go for the ""super bib"" that goes down to the ankles."
2,"Great fabric, too bad it fell apart!","I bought three of these in a couple different patterns for my children to use as bibs. Bumkins also makes sleeved bibs in the same material, so I thought they'd be perfect for my kids who are still messy eaters, yet too big for the sleeved bibs.When I received them, I noticed some loose stitching around the binding and ties, but I figured they would be fine. Wrong. The printed fabric is really great, light and comfortable, but the white binding and ties started to fray and tear within the first 4 months of use. By the time they were 6 months old, each had lost at least one tie and they looked terrible. Now they are a year old, but I am still trying to use them by holding them on my kids with safety pins. The pockets are detaching from the main body of the bib, despite the fact that we have never used the pockets to hold anything.I hope to throw these out soon. I'd never have purchased them had I realized the construction was so poor."
5,Perfect! Just as Expected!,I have an 18 month old little girl and she's always getting her clothes dirty :( because she likes to feed herself. I bought this smock thinking it was a bib. However I am not disappointed I will be using it as a bib and also for when she colors . I love how long it is it covers most of her pants as well as her top. I couldn't have asked for a better bib at a better price.
5,Make lovely cakes with this pan,"For years I used the ""thin"" metal bundt pans that Nordic Ware also makes. These were significantly cheaper than the cast aluminum pan. Admittedly, I was too cheap to fork out $30 for this pan. One day Amazon actually ran this pan for $18 or $19 with super saver shipping, and I jumped on it. There really is a difference in the way that your cakes turn out in this heavier pan. The cakes rise better, and this chrysanthemum design makes for a beautiful cake, even when it's just dusted with powdered sugar. I thought that all of the petals wouldn't release well, but I have made several of the basic Bacardi rum cakes with no problems."
1,Rip-Off,"This tape is fine if you're one of the parents of these kids. It really is irresponsible to be marketing this as a professional performance, when it's really a ballet school(and not a very good one) performance tape. The lead (Snow Queen) shouldn't even be on pointe! Shame on you, whoever you are, for marketing this to the poor unknowing public! (And as for you parents, I'm sure you can find a better ballet school, you just have to do a little homework!)"
4,"the Best of Ron Lloyd, Sky Country","This is one of the best western folk, with a very strong voiceand story telling."
4,Less expensive elsewhere,"My husband and I purchased our first drawer unit when we added onto our house two years ago (and ended up with our very first closet!). We didn't have an inordinate amount of trouble putting it together, and it's worked perfectly since. It looks cheap as all heck, but we knew that before we bought it - and it turns out that the construction is pretty solid. The drawer action is very smooth, which is a nice feature. They don't pull out very far though, so this unit is best used for socks, t-shirts, etc - nothing full-sized that you need to identify before pulling out. For example, storing sweaters or pants in these drawers would probably be a mistake.We're going to buy a second unit today, but not from Amazon. We'll be going to a big-box store, where the price is almost 30% less."
4,Great product but horrible product documentation,"I bought 2 of this along with Rubbermaid 3H89 closet kid. The item looks good but the assembly instructions is very vague. If you have experience with assembling products yourself, you can easily figure it out. Not a big deal. Easy to operate and looks solid."
2,"Two different versions, same package","Rubbermaid makes two different versions of this product. One package has brackets that are set for closet standards 22 1/4 inches apart. The other, newer package has brackets for both 22 1/4 inches and the more compatible 22-inch width. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell looking at the package which brackets are in the box. If you already have standards at 22 inches that you are trying to use this item with, it will not fit. Calling Rubbermaid is no help because they will not provide (even paying) any parts for this unit.Otherwise the product is a nice, attractive product that serves its purpose very well...if you can mount it."
1,Poor Construction,I was very disappointed with this product. First the instructions were horrible and incomplete. The holes on the slides did not match up with the drawer so the front panel didnt sit flush.This product is no longer supported on the rubbermaid closet website. I purchased 4 from target and will be returning all of them.The wire products sold by amazon are all fantastic.
3,"Attractive, but small capacity",This 2-drawer unit was easy to build and surprisingly study once mounted. I was a little disappointed that it does not hold as much as I'd hoped (I'd use it mainly for small items of clothing or cosmetics) and I'd be reluctant to weigh it down too much. But it mounts perfectly on the Rubbermaid hanging standards and is very attractive.
5,Well worth the money!,"I waited to review this drawer unit in order to give an acurate review. This unit has far surpassed my expectations. The drawers continue to slide in and out without incident and look beautiful, I ordered the complete configuration set and have not one complaint about it. This whole system is well worth the money. I would had paid double. I am usually a skeptic but not anymore. again, worth the money!"
3,Hanging Drawer Unit,"This is exactly the piece I searched high and low to find again at Target, only to discover they had stopped carrying the line. It matches, it's fairly straight forward to assemble (although I am a veteran assembler so some may find it more difficult) and holds the small items I need it to house. On the down side...you get what you pay for and this isn't even California Closet or Elf quality, the four wooden dowels punched right through the very flimsy face of each drawer and I only used my hand to insert them. Fine for a remote closet but this line will never be front and center in my house."
3,Suspense all the way,"Juggling with quite a complex plot succeeds very well in this book. The story keeps the suspense up until to the very end, with couple of good twists on the way getting there. Although it was clear that Ivanova would return to her post at the end of the story, I was still worried that it wouldn't work out that way.The events take place after ""The Coming of Shadows"" and before ""All Alone in the Night""."
3,Jhaeman's Review,"Accusations, the second Babylon 5 novel, focuses primarily on Ivanova and Garibaldi (despite his prominence on the cover, G'kar doesn't get much attention). The plot concerns an old friend of Ivanova who gets murdered after coming to Babylon 5 to deliver an important message. Ivanova gets framed for the murder and her and Garibaldi have to figure out how it all ties into frequent raider attacks on incoming shipments of a rare metal.Plot-wise, this is fairly standard stuff (indeed, the framing of a character for a crime they didn't commit was used in the first B5 novel). Accusations is well-written, however, with good characterization and a few twists. It's not the best book ever, but it's worth reading."
4,A good book to read,"Before I bought this book I did not realize that the movie Goodfellas coincided with this book. I am not a huge fan of reading books, but I do like to read one once in a while. I enjoyed this book a lot. Most of the chapters were great. I found difficult to put the book down most of the time. The life of Henry Hill is pretty interesting. Most people look at the mob in the eyes of the Godfather movies. This shows that life in the mob is not always that great for the members and their families. Give this book a read its worth it!"
5,A great book for wiseguys,"Wiseguys by, Nicholas Pileggi is a great book with much detail of life in the mafia. Henry Hill guides us though his life. When you read this book you will learn of some of the sickest and most corrupt gangsters and their way of thinking and behaving. Henry has interesting friends. Jimmy Burke is a true thief, He steals anything he could and Tommy is like one of the sickest murderers in the world, a man that does it for fun.Wiseguys is like a big fat book full of schemes. It goes scheme after scheme. From Henry using fake ten dollar bills to heisting trucks. You do not know what is criminal minded until, you read this book. It has violence, robbery, adultery, and murder. Henry takes you in the life of three decades in the mafia."
5,"A fast-paced, hard-hitting view of life in the mafia.","This a fascinating glimpse inot a lifestyle many will never experience. Pillegi does an artful job of making the reader feel as if he is there, by revealing the mobsters lingo, dress, and secret hand-shakes(page 97). This is the first account of mafia life which does not glamourize the 'gangster' lifestyle. A must read for anyone who has ever played the lotto while wearing flip-flops and a salmon skinned coat(with or without feathers).-LB"
5,Tremendous Read,I am a die hard fan of Goodfellas. IT is my favorite movie and I watch it every chance I get. This book is a must read for all of us Goodfella fans.
5,Best Seller,"No, Mafia book can compare to this, except for THE GODFATHer. It is a good book, for those who are not familiar with high vocabulary. The book is straight forward, easy to read.Great...Awesome....Magnificent....One of the greatest Books ever writen.About the life style of Henry Hill, The half Irish/Italian, Mobster, who always liked gangsters."
5,The best book ever written on the Mafia.,"This book gives incredible insight to the inner workings of the Mafia, as well as being a fantastic read. This book, the basis for the movie ""GoodFellas"" puts the reader into the daily life of a ""half-assed Mafia wiseguy"" (it explains this terminology too).If you have any interest in mafia-related topics, this book is a must read."
5,I wish I could meet Henry Hill,"Fabulous book. I read it in one weekend. A wonderful isight into ""real life"" in the mob and how easy and tempting it can be to be drawn into this lifestyle. This book cuts through all the glamour and romance and shows the mob lifestyle for what it really is. Very well written."
5,Great,"One of the best books ever written about La Cosa Nostra. Pileggi makes you feel like you are on the streets with Henry Hill, watching as he commits crimes."
3,Not what I expected!,"Although entertaining I felt that the book left too many unanswered questions. This book ended abruptly, should have gone into some of the court cases."
4,The real GoodFellas,"If you have seen the movie then it would be recommendable to read the book for more details about Henry Hill’s lifestyle and HIS side of the story and if you haven’t seen the movie well, then you will after reading this book. It tells you about the luxury life style wiseguys have and that you don’t always have to be a made member to gain fame or wealth and it clearly shows you what drug addiction does to you"
3,Good light reading,"As a quilter, I liked the special information about the details of quilting, and could picture the ladies sitting around the quilt, trying to solve the mystery, as they took their tiny stitches. Very much surprised at the ending-the murderer."
4,Out on the limb,"No one I know likes this record but I do. People generally think this woman is just a little too precious for them and in a way I can see their point. However this record has some very tasty and well thought out hooks that make it well worth the $. Lyrically, it's a little too ""you go girl"" for me and to compare her to someone like Kristen Hersh is a stretch at best but don't let that get in the way of this fully enjoyable record. There is a big ""Sundays"" vibe here with piano taking the place of those HUGE textural guitars."
2,Not my bag,"I purchased this CD on the strength of the track ""Fallen for You"" which is included on the High Fidelity soundtrack. While I still enjoy that track, the rest of the album is a real disappointment. Yes, she is a talented pianist and yes, she has a very pleasant voice but the lyrics appear as random stories and really don't go anywhere (as does the music). If you really enjoy ""Fallen For You"" and are hoping the rest of the album is similar material, you'll be disappointed as well.I have hoped that the CD would ""grow on me"" and have given it several listenings but unfortunately this hasn't happened.One star for the ""Fallen For You"" track and the other for her talent but this just isn't my bag."
3,"""Brief Strop""","I have reliable information that John Boylan actually PRODUCED this cd and not executive produced it-as far as the production value, it is excellent, but her voice tends to get whiney and the lyrics are extremely self-indulgent.I have also seen her performing in her early days and apart fromcomplaining about Americans and the United States, I thought she was ungrateful and narcissistic."
5,I love this girl she is a wonderful singer song writer,I saw he in San Francisco on Bay t.v when i was a makeup artist she became one of my fave artist and if you like music like Tori Amos try this singer she is wonderful
5,Absolutely Breathtaking,"Ok, I first stumbled onto Shelia Nicholls when i received a free promotional cd in the mail for my school newspaper. I looked at the promo picture that came along with it, laughed at the girl pictured, complete with dreadlocks. I put it in my cd player, sat down, and my breath was taken away.Usually I'm not into her style, but...she captured me, and totally turned my world upside down. Every night, I go to sleep listening to this cd. Songs that have beautiful musical arrangements, beautiful lyrics, and her voice is so...wow cant even be defined. She is a beautiful song writer, and she deffinetly has a voice to match that talent. I recommend this cd to everyone I know, so therefore I'm recommending it to you as well.Just wait, one day she shall make it big, and I'll be like ""Hey, i listened to her back when she was unknown"". She has a way of making a bad day turn good.Deffinetly check this out. It's worth the 13 or so dollars."
2,NOT the original soundtracks,"Buyer beware: most of these tracks are not Morricone's original soundtracks: Per SoundtrackCollector dot com, All tracks are played by an orchestra conducted by Ralph Gibbs, except GIU' LA TESTA, which IS conducted by Ennio Morricone, (uncertain on this one if OST or a rerecorded arrangement by Morricone). Lack of details on this item prompted this posting."
1,Don't waste your money,"It's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up. But what was worse was that after I owned it for two weeks, the thing stopped working! It was never dropped or damaged in anyway, it just stopped. The display just faded away and wouldn't work again even with a new battery. This one was such a waste of money, I'll definately buy a different brand next time."
3,Not bad - 5 years later needs a new battery,"I had to get it replaced once (free!) due to a few falls (but shouldn't that be a requirement? - ability to withstand a few falls). It seems to be accurate and is discreet enough to wear on my waist without drawing a lot of attention. The 7-day memory is awesome. I need a new battery now - but it's 5 years old, so seems due."
1,PhD required,"I purchased this product from Amazon, and have now had it 7 hours. I have been reading the directions for setting the time almost that long, and still the unit will not set the time of day. My brilliant husband has tried, my brilliant step-son, and brilliant me. I've written a letter to the company. Their web site only provides the same elusive instructions as are on the package. This is not an easy gizmo to work. I haven't given up yet, but I am totally vexed and feel cheated.Signed,Vexed in Vermont"
4,"Simple and accurate, but the clip's not great","I didn't have problems with determining stride length since I cheated - I used my GPS which for short enough distances will show feet traveled, then did 100 steps and did the appropriate math. I tested the accuracy with a walk later that evening with the same GPS and they agreed after a ~2.5 mile walk.I have had a problem with one of the pins that holds the clip and pedometer together - the pin fell out somewhere in the last hundred miles or so, so the whole thing doesn't hold together as well as it did before and has a bit more tendency to fall open. I'll be seeing if a hardware store has any steel rods in the appropriate size and attempting to replace that pin fairly soon."
2,Double failure,"I got a Sportline 360 for Christmas of 2003 which included a two year warranty. In less than a year it failed, losing steps and recording the wrong mileage. After returning it Sportline sent a replacement in late December, 2004, however, the replacement now had a one year warranty. After three months of use, it, too has failed in the same manner. For a top-of-the-line product this ""durability"" is unacceptable."
1,JUNKY,"I bought this pedometer three years ago. It worked properly the first time I used it -- then it shut down when I was inactive, and I could never get it to work right again. About once a month I tried to use it, but I couldn't get it to work so it sat in a drawer. Then, about a year ago I took it to my health club and had the trainers try to help me, but they couldn't get it to work either. Last week I bought an Omron Premium pedometer, Model HJ-112 and I love it!! It works perfectly every day, and is easy to set and use. I will write a review for the omron pedometer soon. Buy that one -- not the Sportline."
2,Lance,OK I think. Very hard to set for new walking miles and time. That's all I realy wanted for but sometimes it over lapped the walking distances. I'm going to try a Oregon Scientific PE316CA.
1,Inaccurate,I went outside and walked 200 steps with this on. It reported 102. Simply is not accurate. Do not buy.
2,Not Accurate,"This is my second pedometer, and while better than my first one, I am not happy with it. The directions are very confusing. I have never figured out some of the features and how to adjust them. If I am doing vigerous walking it does a very good job of counting my steps. However, if I am out shopping or slowly walking, sometimes the step counter never changes. Today, I walked all over the grocery store and the number of steps never changed since I was slowly walking. I am sure there must be a more accurate, easy to use pedometer out there."
2,Disappointing,"I used this pedometer for about 3 months before the pins fell out that held it together - only to be lost forever. This pedometer is not very easy to use.I kept having to refer to the difficult-to-follow instructions to figure out how it works. It has some good features, but I lost interest in trying to learn about them, so I ended up just resetting it daily and using the step/calorie counters only. All in all, I am going to buy another pedometer as this one is useless to me without the belt clip."
4,"Great pedometer, lousy clip","I love the pedometer but the clip is lousy. We own a 116 acre farm in which I do a lot of walking to and from various sites. The 1st day I wore the pedometer, I lost it 3 times while logging 4 miles on it. I probably walked six miles as I had to retrace my steps to find it! Now in all fairness, that particular day, I was cutting briars and running a small chainsaw which required a lot of bending from the waist.The pedometer is easy to use and set-up. Definitely worth the money."
3,Kind of complicated to setup.,"The goods: Inexpensive, very light when you wear it and tracks seven days of your walking activities after you learn how it works. The best thing is the auto start and shut off.The bads: Couldn't read the setup instructions even with my glasses on. I had to scan and reprint a readable instructivemanual."
1,"Good idea, poor execution.","I have used pedometers for a few years. I was initially impressed with this pedometer BUT then I discovered the 360 I received did not always 'wake' and keep track of steps. The 360 I received did not always count steps even when already 'awake.' The 'sleep' 'wake' feature is bogus, it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser. I would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep. Heartrate Monitors, the company I bought it from was not responsive when I asked for guidance. I bought another pedometer from a different dealer, the Sportline 345 - It's my second 345, need I say more."
4,Nice gift for spiritual person,"Purchased this gift to convey my love to my daughter and granddaughter. Sent it to myself first, to check it over. Very nice. Good quality. I think they will enjoy it for years to come. Jean M. Eno"
1,This is not a South Beach Diet cookbook,"Because of the presentation of this book on the Amazon site, and the ""fat"" and ""carb"" reference on the cover, people will assume this book is associated with The South Beach Diet. It clearly is not. With references to ""phases"" and such in this book, I think that Nancy McCune is trying to rip off the public and lead people to believe this book is affiliated with Dr. Agatston and The South Beach Diet. It is not.With ingredients listed such as full-fat cream, some of the recipes in this book will not be fitting for those following The South Beach Diet.I recommend that people stick with THE South Beach Diet cookbooks by Dr. Arthur Agatston, and avoid this cheap imitation."
5,If the intention was...,"to produce a broad grin on the hearer while listening to these tracks, then this album is a great success.It's a great nostalgia CD because it contains original versions of great old TV themes from the 1960s and 1970s. I've never heard such a great version of the Dick Van Dyke Show theme (Earle Hagen composer, Nelson Riddle performer) The U.N.C.L.E. and Odd Couple themes get lively playing, too.Highly recommended. Hope there are more CDs like this one out there."
3,It's ok but...,I like this pocketbook except for one feature - the top zipper opening is very small. The size of the opening would make it very hard to find things inside this bag. It's hard to tell from the picture just how small the opening actually is.
2,good for please and thankyou,"I bought these tapes before going to Germany, and found them useful in asking questions, such as, ""Do you have a room available"", but the only problem is that they don't really brief you on responces...understanding what people would answer back was quite confusing."
4,Latin Fever,"Oooh, so many Desi Arnaz moments on this disc! Like being at Ricky's nightclub in the 50's! Best track: ""Brazil."" You'll freak at the piercing whistles and fast, faster, fastest drumming!"
3,Jean Rollins,"I'm an admirer of Jean Rollins work, and this film is the one which to me best represents his style. It succeeds in blending the sexual predator images of the more successful Hammer vampire movies, with the doomed romanticism of French cinema. The production values are low, presumably they operated on a very small budget, but as I was starting to experiment with my own low production films, I was inspired by how much it achieves in spite of its limitations.The film is driven by a series of powerful images, notably the semi-naked girl wielding a scythe, and the odd bit of lesbian love action. As with all of Rollins best films, you get the feeling of getting a glimpse of, and being allowed to share, a very personal obsession."
4,Fascinated with Rollin and Lahaie,"Director Jean Rollin and bodacious French actress Brigitte Lahaie have combined on a number of very special (if somewhat flawed) supernatural films. ""Fascination"" is probably the very best. A coven of beautiful vampire women, a criminal on the run, Lahaie in Grim Reaper's black carrying her giant scythe... all memorable elements in an etheral film that is more mesmerizingly compelling than narratively intact. Relax and enjoy as Rollin and Lahaie manipulate the images that will fascinate your mind.This is the kind of horror film that incites more unsettling echoes later on as opposed to shocks upon initial viewing. In the end it is well worth watching."
5,exquisite,"I recently discovered the films of Jean Rollins and was captivated by their dreamlike beauty. Fascination is no exception and it is the finest of the Rollin's films that I have had seen thus far. Dark, sensual, and beautiful."
2,"OK, but TOTALLY overrated!","Too much chocolate, but the filling is decent.They're pretty sweet too. Overly sweet.I prefer Rice Crispie Treats or Star Crunch!2.5 stars."
2,Such An Average Craving,"Little Debbie, much like Hostess, is a company that serves chocolate cake-like products to grocery stores. You can find them for dirt cheap. Swiss Cakes Rolls are just not very tasty to me. They taste cheap, as if the chocolate was set out in the rain for too long. There's something about these, and it just resembles a cheap taste. The inside has creme, but not as much as Ho-Hos do, therefore they taste somewhat dry and not as fresh. The chocolate cake wrapped around tastes blank and unnatural. Then the extra chocolate above tastes just as bad.So, in overall terms, Little Debbie's Swiss Cake Rolls are just not good. The choclate tastes cheap and unnatural, and there is not enough creme inside the rolls. Do yourself a favor and pass on this Little Debbie product. 2 stars."
3,A beautiful song,"""Rhythm of the night"" is a very beautiful song. I have heard this song in turkish but it's even better in english."
3,An interesting men's fragrance,"Thallium Sport is an interesting cologne that is fairly distinct. While I initially liked the cologne during testing, I found the scent a bit off. However, the cologne did seem strong enough and lasted at least for several hours. Interestingly enough other people liked the scent and would comment on it. The scent seemed to smell like sour candy which may or may not be what others smell. Not bad though."
5,GREAT,I REALLY LOVE THIS CD. I'VE SHARED THIS WITH OTHERS AND NOW THEY WANT IT. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS. I CANNOT WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT CD TO COME OUT!!!
5,Smooth jazz Junky,"Hey fellas just wan;t to commend you on ep you guys deserve all of the credit for a well put together project. I truly love all of the arrangements of all the songs they truly put me in a relaxing mood. I do here Fourplay, rippingtons, pieces of a dream In your style of music Finaly a group of guys who have honed there crafts in the music industry to give the name ""smooth jazz"" a new meaning. Great music guys i can't wait for the next cd and to see you live."
2,SLOW MAIL,"I'm sure the product was good(I ordered the German one previously and it was helpful for my 1 week trip.), but this one came too late for me to take with me. It was mailed(regular mail) from TX and Im in NV-how long could it take for regular mail? A week, maybe ten days at the most right? I ordered on 1/9(notified that it was shipped on 1/11) and it came on 1/23(14 days from the order date!)-and a day after I left. Disappointing. The purchase price was a buck--hard to justify $5-6 on expedited shipping when there was 12 days to get it there. Its not like it was coming from the east coast!"
3,Very short record with some good songs,"At only 31 minutes, and with only eight songs, this is not a good value as a CD. I own the record, and side two looks only about half full.There's a nice version of The Christmas Song, and A Very Special Holiday is a good tune, but White Christmas gets an un-Christmassy disco treatment. Even if you like 3/4ths of this record, you'll only be getting six songs. Dedicated fans of The Whispers may want to spend the money; other probably won't."
4,A must for any Jack Benny fan,"A thoroughly engaging and briskly written portrait of the world's greatest comedian by the man who was his producer, business manager, and close friend for 28 years. It's chock full of humorous anecdotes about Jack's many famous friends. It also details the stories behind some of his most famous sketches and how they were written. In short, a must for any Benny fan!"
4,Great low-cost HT Receiver,"After 9 years of off & on problems with my Pioneer, I decided it was time for a new Home Theater Receiver. I have always been impressed with Onkyo quality and price-performance. If you're looking to replace or add a receiver for less than $300, you can't beat the TX-SR574. It is easy to install and operate, has ample power for a mid-sized room, can easily handle several A/V devices and provides a plethora of listening modes.A minor gotcha, read the full installation instructions, not just the Quick Start prior to firing it up (a couple of things to be aware of with DVD and 5.1 speaker setup)."
5,Superb Classic!,"""Hedi"" is a book that most all young girls will enjoy reading. My 11 yr. old grandaughter enjoyed it very much. I'm glad I was able to add this book to her library."
1,WARNING,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD if you want ""In the Flesh"" directed by Ben Taylor. This is not his very fine gay movie, but a heterosexual romp of 48"" bimbos. If, on the other hand, you like big blond bimbos, go for it. Unfortunately, AMAZON has not corrected their description, so both gay and straight audiences are misinformed."
2,Not All That,"This screen protector may indeed protect the screen (I had no scratches before and none now, so how would I know?) but it definitely does *not* reduce screen glare nor is it any less susceptible to finger prints.Application without leaving spots (air bubbles) is not possible.The ""Anti-Glare"" should be removed from the name and description.A big ""meh"" all around."
2,not as advertised,"It was impossible to apply without lint under the screen. It has terrible glare. I had to remove it, it was impossible to read with it on my nook's screen."
2,"""Anti-glare"" is NOT the same as ""matte""!","Quick and to the point: Don't bother, unless you want a shiny, reflective, glossy surface on your e-reader. If you want something that is invisible, applies well, and has a truly matte coating on it, then choose either the official screen protector from B&N;, or choose the M-Edge version which has more in one package and presents a slightly better value.This one is only good for protecting your screen. It does nothing for the usability or readability, though.Avoid and spring for the better quality. Seriously... You won't get much use out of this. It may be great for LCD, but this material is terrible on e-ink."
5,It's a no brainer!,"Every product should be sold in one of these containers. They really don't leak... at all! I haven't found much use for the included spouts, but they would seem quite useful if the application presented itself. The included labels don't smudge or bleed and hold permanent marker remarkably well. If you travel often, want to de-clutter your shower or just need to portion out your economy size toiletries, I highly recommend these."
2,"Flimsy, Not Worth the Price","Received the bottle containers and was NOT impressed. I was looking for something that would be difficult to open on its own as I often take liquids and gels in my luggage for travel. The open/close lids on the bottles are flimsy. Also, I am unsure what to do w/ most of the the nozzles included w/ the bottles. Most don't even the bottles! Would not purchase these again."
2,not for air travel,"bottles have to be under three ounces to pass airport carry-on security. too bad. be careful, or they'll take your products."
2,no preview available,"I was looking for a specific song that I thought was on the CD but didn't know the title. I couldn't preview the songs, but I bought it anyway and the song I was looking for was not on the CD."
4,Topsy-Turvy Lounge,"This is the most whimsical entry in the Ultra Lounge series, and would fit right in with a lime green and orange lounge filled with bean bags and moon lamps. I'm sure Austin Powers would dig it.Some of the highlights are:""Big Noise From Winnetka/Midnight Swim"" - horn-laden big band segues into loungy film score from ""Sex and The Single Girl"",""Hot Toddy"" - swingin' Julie London vocals, ""doo-doo-doo"",""Mah-Na, Mah-Na"" - harmonica and kazoo,""Guys and Dolls"" - if Tubular Bells were lounge,""Cute"" - organ fits the title,""Donkey Serenade"" - vibraphone over a bass guitar that sounds like hoof beats,""Baby Elephant Walk/Java"" - classic 60s pop,""Potluck"" - scat singing,""Squatty Roo"" - angular ""squatty"" sound,""Deep Purple/S' Wonderful"" - strange theremin sounds (could have been included on Space Capades),""Quiet Village"" - a classic tiki lounge song revisited on Moog (another song that could have been on Space Capades)."
4,Wonderful Catechism for Catholics,"Very informative and plainly written catechism of the Catholic church. Having been raised in the faith I've spent many years as a fallen away Catholic. Though I haven't had a resurgence of spirituality I do have a quite high opinion of both the church, its intellectual history and its theology.This isn't exactly Thomas Aquainas or St Augustine but what it is are simple and well thought out answers to what the church believes and why it conducts itself the way it does. Interesting reading and highly recommended."
1,Crazy Burger Hassle,"The problem i have with this game is you have to use your up, down, left, right and space bar in order to move the employee. Which causes you to spend more time trying to get to the right position or item. That's why i don't like it."
2,its okay,"the game is ok and would be so much more enjoyable if you could use the mouse and not the keyboard, i hate games that have you use the keyboard.so i was extremely annoyed that you had to with this game.unless someone knows how to you can use the mouse with this game please post how."
1,Crazy Burger,"I, like many others have Diner Dash and Cake Mania which I enjoy so much, but any game that uses the keyboard is not may idea of a computer game. I might have enjoyed if I could have used the mouse. This game goes in the garbage.I would advise others not to buy it."
1,Great game if we were still using Windows 3.1,"Big disappointment. Bought this for my boys who are 7. They loved Diner Dash and I saw this one at a good price and thought this would be a good purchase for the boys. Was I ever wrong. One of my boys, who is usually a whiz at all things computer became frustated immediately. If I could give this one no stars I would. Who uses arrow keys to play PC games like this anymore anyway?!"
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. IF I KNEW I HAD TO USE MY KEYBOARD I WOULD NEVER HAD BROUGHT THE GAME. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE.
2,"Great company, not so great game",The company was great. sent the game quickly and product was as it was described. The game is pretty dated and it makes the game play difficult. It uses the keyboard and not the mouse.
4,Fun & Challenging,"I get bored after a little while with most games but, this one is truly addictive and challenging. I found myself getting frustrated when I made stupid mistakes that cost me a level, which just made me want to play more! LOVE this game!"
1,Corny!!!!!!!!,"I cannot stand this game!!!!! I hated it so much that I had to send it back. I only had this game for a 1/2 day, but if anyone still decide to get it keep in mind you will not get a full refund!!!!!! Just FYI."
4,a very good game,I purchased this game in the shadow of diner dash. It has turned out to be better IMO.The graphics are great and the game play is wonderfull. As for the above post about spyware...LOLThis game uses active X controls which is built into windows and Internet explorer. the game browser that launches the game uses active X. His/Her security is so high that they have issues with a video game. ha ha ha that is outrageous. Active X must be enabled to use 90% of what is on the net as well as many many different products.
5,Unreal Game Engine,"I bought this as required material in the Game Design course through the Art Institute. Included on the game disc is a copy of Unreal Editor, which allows you to create your own levels. There are a ton of online tutorials available (just google it) and it is VERY easy to work with - with the exception of scale. It works in increments of tens, but there is no 'default' measuring system. The first time I tried to create a level, it was 1/10th the scale I needed, lol."
3,Meh,Definitely not the best shooter around. The jumping around and warping all over the place makes it almost unplayable. This one will be taking up shelf space.
4,Great,Game got to me in great condition. Arrived in the shipping time frame even though I ordered it right before 4th of July weekend. Thanks!
2,Bleak and Full of Typos,"Yikes, I see after years of complaints about typos, I still have a seriously flawed copy in 2012. Wouldn't the author be upset about such lame mistakes? Besides that, I found the story bleak, pointless, unrelenting in unfulfilment. Did any characters change or grow? And the ending! Very disappointing all around."
1,Kindle edition has DOZENS of typos,"I am a fan of Alan H and had never read the Folding Star. This particular Kindle edition, however, is riddled with typos... Dozens of them. It's annoying, distracting and definitely detracts from the experience. It looks to me like they scanned a printed edition and then didn't correct the mistakes. Would not have bought this if I had know about the condition which runs throughout the book. Shoddy-the writing deserves better!"
2,Ambitious but not memorable,"Hollinghurst is a good writer. I enjoyed reading The Swimming Pool Library, a book he kept under tighter control than this one, which suffers badly from over-writing. A good editor would have helped, because this haunting story of love and obsession -- a plot that brings to mind stories like A.S. Byatt's Possession -- has great potential. Hollinghurst drops the ball, alas, with far too much description taking away from the core of the story, the homoerotic obsession of the main character, his last great love, and the peripheral mystery of who's killing young boys who hang around Le Cassette, the gay bar. There's a terrific story here, but Hollinghurst has not told it."
2,did not enjoy it at all. I couldn't wait for it to end,"I am surprised by the large number of reviewers who enjoyed the book. I found the main character, Edward, completely uninteresting. He seemed just another 30'ish man, who drinks too much, smokes too much and lusts after-what a surprise-someone who is younger than himself and at first unobtainable. When the adored one is finally available, they have one sexual encounter and then he vanishes with no explanation. The ending is very unsatisfying and after having read it several times again, I still can't figure out exactly how it did end.There is too much ambiguity and no real denouement. I kept expecting Luc to be discovered and an outburst of some unspoken truth. But, he just vanishes and then it ends after a desperate search which leads no where. I found the secondary characters to be as dreary as the main characters and over all, I would recommend this book to no one."
3,Too Fast For Me!!,"I bought this because it sounded like a great CD, but if you're old and short and fat like me it's really way too fast - I don't believe I'll ever make this pace! Before you buy, count your own pace in beats per minute at a good aerobic pace - then shop for an appropriate CD for your pace. I found other good collections by other sports music companies - starting as slow as 108 BPM. In my current condition I can work up to about 115 but that's really the limit. 134 BPM is coronary country for me. Walk On!"
5,Great for Aquatics,"I teach an aquatic shaping and toning class and this is my favorite CD. The class, which varies in age from 30 - 70, enjoys this music and it contains nothing objectionable. I only wish SHAPE would put out some more of this great stuff."
5,This is a really great exercise tape!!,"I bought this CD when I started exercising regularly about six weeks ago. Working out to this CD is so enjoyable, I almost hate to have my sessions end! If you're really into 70's music, you'll really love it! And, if you're not, you WILL be after you work out to this CD. Shape also has great exercise information/suggestions in the CD cover. I especially found the pulse rate table helpful. It's a great, great CD! It even makes getting up at 4:00 am to exercise easier! I'm so glad I found this great CD!!!"
2,"PRETTY OUTSIDE, BAD CONSTRUCTION","We got this bed in November 2007 and although it is very pretty, I would not recommend this product. About one month ago, in April 2008, I noticed every time we sit on it, ever so lightly, it squeeks. It is getting louder and louder. Now we're afraid to use it at all.My husband took the whole thing apart, installed rubber washers in between the bolt and wood, reassembled it, and it worked for about a week. Now it's so bad, I wish we had never purchased it. We tightened everything up but cannot find the source of the problem. DO NOT buy this bed."
1,dirty,"The thing was complete, but not new, as advertized. Some pieces were broken and others contained bedding."
4,Nice Tablecloth,The tablecloth's quality is good and very easy to clean. Looked like the picture and was received in a timely manner.
2,Beautiful to look at but very THIN and not durable,I really love the look of this table cloth but within a day it already had a tear in it from pushing a laptop across the top of my kitchen table. It is simply not durable and definitely NOT machine washable. I read a review talking about the durability and purchased based on that. So sorry I did. A waste of money if you're looking for something to last. However the shipper did ship fast so I gave it two stars.
2,Not as advertised,"This product does slide and it is definitely not 3 mm in thickness, which led me to believe that it was a heavy duty vinyl tablecloth. It is no different from the cheap Target vinyl tablecloths. The pattern is pretty, however. Nevertheless I am returning this product."
5,New Owner,"I've had this awhile but finally it is on our kitchen table. It is thin as some have said but what can a person expect at the low price? It looks good and is easy to wash off. Some have said they put it in their washing machine .. can't see how anyone would want to do that with a vinyl tablecloth. If you wipe it with soapy water the vinyl smell goes away as do the wrinkles. Since I can't find oval tablecloths in stores anymore and I have an oval table, I'm just glad someone is offering them for sale on Amazon!"
2,Not thrilled,"The table cloth was the expected color and size. When I opened it, it was all wrinkled, and I think the instructions said not to iron it, so I put it in our front-load washing machine on the gentle/delicate cycle thinking it could get rid of the chemical smell and wrinkles. Then I used the 'air fluff' cycle of the dryer. When I removed the table cloth, it was still wrinkly but didn't stink as much. Then, I put it on the table I noticed little tears/pokes throughout the vinyl top. I'm pretty disappointed because I was hoping for something more durable."
4,good make,fgreat its the table well and easy care. really like it for everyday use on our table.good for outside use also.
3,Its ok,"The video looks alittle dated, but it still has some good info. Dave Limina shows you how to do exercises that are also printed in the little booklet. You have to take the time out to practice them, and if you do you can make some cool sounds. I wish that the book had some more stuff in it. Its not bad."
4,Hadn't heard this stuff for awhile,"Most of these big 70s hits were really overplayed on radio, and I thought I was thoroughly sick of them. However, listening again, I can hear the strong musicianship shine through in ways not audible on the tinny car radios back in the day when this music was contemporary. This CD has all the biggest early stuff, but is missing the 80s, actually a bigger sales era for this band. I do miss ""These Dreams"" here. Call me a sap."
4,Great collection,"A great cd of their earlier work prior to their comebackin '85. I evEn like the new song ""STRONG STRONG WIND"", although it seems to not be a fan favorite. I had to give it 4 stars though, where is ""ALLIES?"""
3,Beware of version of Dreamboat Annie,"I love Heart, and nearly all of the songs on the CD are the original favorites. But Dreamboat Annie has always been my favorite Heart song and the version on this CD is a slower version than the familiar one I grew up listening to on the radio. I wish I had read Amazon's reviews before purchasing this CD because others have expressed disappointment about Dreamboat Annie as well."
4,Comprehensible collection of Heart firts years,"Great album! when Heart in the late 70s and early 80s were more about hard rock, and less about rock stars with the huge sucess they reached after 1984, Wilson sisters were in plenty of their respective skills , guitar and voice , this compilation is eclectic, interesting , musically and lyrically amazing, Zeppeling influence is impossible to deny and actually this two sister show to be proud of this (as live ""rock and roll"" cover proves) actually if there had to be a version of Zeppelin with women definitelly had to be the Wilsons in charge of this ensamble and fate wanted it happened for our deligth , ""barracuda"" , ""little queen"" and the newly recorded ""strong strong wind"" make of this album a basic piece to be part of every real hard rock collectorenjoy!!!HM"
4,"Not the first, but a more complete Greatest Hits package","A little more complete collection than the ""These Dreams"" collection Capitol Records released last year. Not only is there a new song here . . . but also a real gem . . . that most reviewers have missed. Heart's version of Led Zeppelin's ""Rock And Roll"" that was a real crowd pleaser for the Seattle band through out the '70s."
3,About What Is Expected,"This compilation is about what is expected. Heart had some big hits and good music, but they also had some lesser-known works and mediocre music. This compilation contains both. Heart's basic song construction and strong vocals make for good ""work-out"" music."
4,Ordinary Ballad?,"I would care to differ...with the multiple octave wailings of Ann Wilson the ballad ""Strong Strong Wind"" is a must for any fan of great music! I saw Ms. Wilson perform this live on her ""Heart featuring Ann Wilson"" tour this past Summer and she performed said song flawlessly...with all the lame Greatest Hits cd's floating around with rehashed songs we've already heard it's nice to see a new song appear on one every so often! I would give 5 stars but I'm not a big fan of the Greatest Hits packages but I'll make an exception to this..."
5,c manchester,"the cd is in great shape, the service was great and I love the music on this cd.I would recommend Amazon to anyone"
3,Not up to the usual standards,"Francis can usually be counted on for a good, well-written story. There are always elements the reader can count on: a badly injured hero who is one of the nicest guys you could know; a villain without even a semblance of a conscience; and a terrible crime. All three are present in Proof, but something is lacking.Proof lacks the intensity of most of his mysteries. It reads well and quickly, but without the usual depth Francis normally gives to his stories. The opening scene of carnage is fast and furious and up to the standard. Between that and the few active scenes is a lot of exposition about alcoholic beverages, shipment of same, and the hero's past.The reader does come away with knowledge not usually known, such as the ability of some people to discern even the slightest nuance of liquor or wine. And it is compelling enough to make finishing the book necessary. Not his best, but Francis always has good moments at least."
3,BBC radio show version,"Proof is one of my favorite books of any genre. I have read it several times, and own the abridged audiobook read by Charles Dance. I was thrilled to find out that there was a radio drama based on it, but I was very disappointed by it - they cut things I found to be vital to the story, and added events and plot twists that do not exist in any way in the book.It IS well-acted and produced (hence 3 stars), but I'm left scratching my head over the rather unnecessary (to my mind) additions and omissions."
5,Murder at the Bars...and Tracks....,"One of the all time best books I have ever read. Dick Francis is a master writer. Formerly a jockey for the Queen Mother, he has a unique view into the horse racing world of England. His research is flawless and I never fail to learn something from reading any of his books. Proof was one of his best and I highly recommend it.Bootlegged whiskey and murder lead the hero into the not so nice side of crime in England."
5,A very satisfying mystery that doesn't get old,"The opening chapter introduces the widowed wine merchant Tony Beach and may seem a bit mauldling but keep on reading. This is peopled with people you would love to hang with and people you would hate to meet. It is exciting and as usual, the author plays fair by introducing information in a timely manner. A very satisfying mystery, it gets better with every page."
4,Dick Francis with a twist (pun intended),"This book is a typical Francis hard-to-put-down, fast-reading thriller with one exception. Francis does his usual thorough job of investigating Clancy-style, but this time goes easy on the horses and heavy on the liquor industry. As usual, one is swept away by the story and is delighted to learn what Francis has uncovered in his research."
3,good recording,This is a hard book to find on recording. cover is well worn but the sound was fine. I would try again.
5,This book has changed my life!,"I found this book in my high school. When I began reading it, it took me awhile to understand, but now it is my most prized possession. To me, there is truth in the teachings, and everyone can do the exercises that the book describes. I recommend that everyone at least scan wonderful book."
1,Excellent Product for home or institutional use,I ordered this product for my parents who are residing in assisted living. It is well made and very good value for the price. It is a much better design than others that were recommended to me. It works well and the aides who work at the facility were very pleased with it also.
1,Duro-Med Bench,The bench was very uncomfortable and hurt the base of the spine area. I hope to get rid of the thing quickly as I will never use it again.
4,sliding transfer bench,The tub bench is very useful and safe. The only problem I have is that my husband has Parkinson's and is very stiff. He has trouble sitting down. I think another handle on the left side would give him something to hold onto and give him confidence to sit down. Getting him seated is the only problem I have. Otherwise I have no complaints. I think it would be just perfect if he wasn't so rigid. Amazon shipped it extremely fast.It was extremely easy to aassemble. I had no problems.Duro-Med Heavy-Duty Sliding Transfer Bench with Cut-Out Seat
2,Safety Problem,"The bench itself is well made and sturdy. My only problem was with the cut out seat feature. The plug piece fits into a recess in the seat but does not fasten in. If the user adjusts his position or gets up, the plug sticks to his bottom and comes out of the recess. It then falls off and wedges diagonally in the cutout hole or falls through to the floor. Either action can cause an unexpected and painful twist to the lower back. THIS IS DANGEROUS. I contacted the manufacturer who told me they have no solution to this problem. I had to lace the plug down with string to make the bench useable."
2,Measure carefully,"Measure your tub carefully. Because of the flair of the legs and the construction of the slide this chair requires a very wide tub. For our tub, when the seat is fully ""in"" it is still well out over the tub wall, making it unusable. Wasted a lot of money. I would not recommend this chair."
5,Love this product,This chair is a life and back saver for me. My mother is 89 and she could not step into the bathtub without me lifting her. She loves the seat style to make it easy for her to bath. We were going to redo the bathtub now we don't have too. I also received free shipping at Amazon and they had the best price too.
4,A lot of Good information,"Gibby's ""Primitive clothing of the Native Americans"" contains a lot of good 'how-to' info on making traditional and not-so-traditional buckskin garments. What differentiates this book from others is that it is not geared so much at replicators who want to make things exactly like they can be proven to have been made (museum quality replications), but more at regular folks who want to make buckskin clothing, and may or may not want to follow traditional styles."
4,Interesting and well written,This book is very interesting and well written. It is a good resource for clothing and accessories for native people from before contact. If you are looking to research clothing after European contact this book will be disappointing. The articles of clothing it covers are made of natural materials such as grasses and other fibers and buckskin.
5,Great Student Resource,I am a youth pastor and i purchased this book to go along with an apologetics study I was having within my youth ministry. It has been a great asset. It is a challenging read for those that are new in their walk with God but truly a great challenge to their faith to encourage them to grow.
1,Not for me,"I have dial-up internet service. This product is constantly wanting me to connect to the Microsoft web site for ""updates"". It started the day after I finished installing the product...which took about 7 hours total over 3 days.I stopped updating after the 2nd day because it was taking so long. Now, about 2 weeks later, it says I need to download 85megs of ""updates"".It was nice enough to estimate that would be just over 9 hours at my connection speed. My current ISP is pretty good, but will not let me stay on for 9 continuous hours."
1,SLOWS DOWN COMPUTER,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PROGRAM. MADE MY COMPUTER MOVE LIKE A TURTLE. VIRUS PROTECTION NEVER WORKED. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,The Product Key Code is invalid!!!,"Need say more? It looks like I bought a pirate software, but I didn't. I got stuck in installation, while the service offered no help."
1,I wish I wouldn't had bought this,"It took half a day to install, then the other half the day was spent installing missing updates. After I got through all that, it wants you to go online and activate your subscription to Live OneCare. I've had problems doing this and still haven't gotton it done. And the help button that's on the Live OneCare....doesn't help with anything."
3,microsoft onecare,"this products has some features that might annoy some.The program demands that you backup once a week, also you have to do full symstems scaning and deframentaion once a month. this takes quite a bit of time. also when you install you have to run a full sysem check, and then the sysem demand a few days later to redo. Besides this I liked the Technical assistance, once again when you got the right party. So far everthing is working just fine."
5,Windows Live OneCare CARE,"I have been a Trend user for years but this product exceeds my expectations by giving me reminders to backup my data, giving automatic updates, and providing tools for computer maintenance that everyone should take care of to insure optimal uptime."
2,Nothing but problems,I purchased this subscription program because my brand new laptop had the trial version on it. I was never able to activate it and finally gave up after even Email and phone help with Microsoft customer service (with technicians on 3 continents) could not resolve the situation. I ended up giving it to a friend. What a waste.
1,Very disappointing,"Essentially, my unfavorable rating came down to the fact that it rebooted my computer every two minutes, after I installed the 90 day free trial. I'm uninterested in software that broken."
4,It seems to work okay.,"My machine is still running clean after 4 months. I like the port blocking feature. Although I haven't needed customer support, it's bound to be better than Symantecs."
3,One Care? NO WAY!,"I will give it 3 Stars for a good effort, but after careful and extensive beta testing there is no way I will dump NOD32 for One Care, not even if Microsoft starts giving it away free!NOD32's Heuristics and the new Threat Sense detect new viruses hours AND SOMETIMES DAYS before One Care knows about them.Try getting all the bugs out of your Operating Systems Microsoft, and leave malware to the experts."
1,Doesn't Work,I have a less that one year old DELL XP computer from which I completely removed Norton. This product refused to load onto my machine. I was able to load a new version of Defender Pro with no problems.
1,"Forget the ""Care"",","I purchased the boxed version and had a frustrating experience. A poorly designed installation process, backed by a seemingly non-existing (more than likely out-sourced) customer service, endless waiting times, a frustrating overall experience. I felt it was a total waste of money and time and effort. Now I am trying the direct download that installs a little more smoothly..."
1,Remind me again why anyone has to pay for Virus protection?,"Seems to me that a software company responsible for tens of thousands of known bugs in their Operating System should provide FREE care for their own fallacies. The good portion of known viruses are gaining access to computers through software vulnerabilities in the OS, so why doesn't Microsoft provide support for this? I can't think of one other viable market in which this business model works.Just know you're paying a premium to MS because they were incapable of fixing these problems to begin with."
4,Amazingly Easy,Once this is on your computer it reminds when there are updates and has a visual status as to the current condition of your computers security... This is an all in one product package.
4,Great AV product,"Great simple product that anyone can use to protect themselves and doesn't seem to slow the PC to a crawl like McAfee and Norton seem to do (especially McAfee).My only complaint is the lack of options on the policy and notices. For example if you don't have the phishing filter in IE7 turned on it keeps notifying you about it. I don't feel I need to send all my URLs to Microsoft to validate them.Even with that the product is still the best out there, especially for the discounted price! :-) I have it installed on all 3 PC's in the house!"
2,Released a bit too early,"Check all the reviews. It appears completely hit or miss as to whether this software loads correctly. Loaded easily on my first two computers in minutes. Then I loaded it into my laptop. It didn't load correctly. Okay no big deal. I'd would just delete it and start over again or use another product. But it wouldn't delete. It was stuck on my computer but not working. Called customer service. They got right on the line. Said 'no problem. We'll take over control of your computer and have it fixed in no time. With complete control of my computer, and all the assets of the Microsoft Empire at their disposal, it took over three hours to completely fix the problem.My Advice- wait for version 2.0"
1,Terrible Support for a Good Program,"My two and a half month experience with Microsoft Live OneCare is that it is a good product that has a fatal flaw, terrible support by Microsoft. The program includes virus protection and backup and recovery and they are great. Unfortunately, if you experience any problems with OneCare you are completely on your own. My experience with Microsoft support has been that there is no support. The help feature includes multiple ways to contract Microsoft, and they all don't work. I always get an acknowledgement that my request was received, plus a promise that I'll be contacted within 24 hours, and then nothing. Email, web and phone contacts all generate the same level of unresponsiveness. I have always been a great fan of Microsoft software and hardware, and I suppose I still am, but this program is one to avoid."
2,OneCare or CareLess?,"I installed OneCare on a new up-to-date computer. Right off, Windows Explorer started saying ""A fault in the program had occured."" Within a couple of days, my new computer had a trojan but was caught by Spybot Search and Destroy thankfully. This was a known trojan, though updated software, why didn't OneCare catch it in the ""real times monitoring""? I deleted out OneCare to replace it with Norton, and noticed that the ""Program Faults"" also stopped. This program is plain Jane, without many options. It may become better with time, as this one is a Beta version *having to PAY to test it for them*Right now I am not impressed, and doesn't appear as good as freebies on the net like Zone Alarm Firewall and AVG for anti virus. I am surprised to see all the positive ratings for this product."
2,"Why pay money for testing ""beta"" software?","I had heard and read good reviews of this product. The virus scanner is painfully slow. To add insult to injury, you are ""paying money"" for a ""Beta"" version of software.First activation, now paying money to test microsoft's products. I'm afraid to ask what's next. I see no reason or advantage to buying this product."
1,Caution,This version is an old version. You will have to download the latest version. Have dial-up and took 2 hours to download and still would not install. Microsoft could not help me. Installed Vista and tried to install again. Said I needed Service Pack 2 which Vista deletes on installation. Finally got it installed by trickery on the web. This is now 30 days later and now have virus protection. Go to the website to purchase this item.
1,Random freezes appear to have been fixed.,"MS must have ""fixed"" the problem with an ""update"". My machine has not crashed for weeks... knock on wood. Without the crashes I give it three stars. I still have to use other spyware apps to clean up what MS WLOC misses.Same random ""freezes"" are happening on my machine while using Firefox. Horrible product... more like a virus than a ""virus checker"". Another fun annoyance is with Onecare backups. Try deleting the file from your external hard drive... can't do it... not even after applying ""Sharing"" attributes as suggested by MS. This is more like a ""freeware"" app than a major software product produced by MS."
5,VERY GOOD PROGRAM I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!!,"I TRYED THE 90 DAYS FREE WINDOWS LIVE ONE CARE,ITS A VERY GOOD PROGRAM,WHEN YOUR 90 DAYS RUNS OUT ITS VERY EASY TO PUT IN YOUR PRODUCT KEY,ALL IN ALL THIS PROGRAM TO ME IS THE BEST MICROSOFT PROGRAM EVER GOOD JOB MICROSOFT!!"
3,arrived broken,"While putting this together I noticed that one of the attachments for the leg was broken. The packaging on arrival looked fine, it was just a defect in the wood. The member was cut funny and it split along the grain of the wood. I was able to use some wood glue and a clamp to fix it, and now it seems to be holding fine. As long as it holds, it looks great and is a nice addition to my place."
5,Perfect!,"After a wine tasting trip, my mother had a LOT of bottles of wine from her excursion but no where to put them! She doesn't have the space or money for a huge rack or for one to be built into her kitchen, so I got her this for mother's day. It was the perfect size; it fits right in her hallway. And it was so simple to put together - had it waiting for her in the morning. I definitely recommend this to any one with a small wine collection and a small house to put it in!"
4,Great Expectations,"This product satisfied my seemingly endless search for a good quality, simple, inexpensive wine rack. It took some muscle to put it together but was well worth it. Great quality for the price. Just what I was looking for. Dealer and rack met my expectations. I would definitely purchase this item again."
1,BOO!! This was really disapointing.,"Calafornia holloday is not at all what i expected. It looked good but i was mistaking. The Main Character Roanne meets this guy and he is a drug adict. She falls in love with him. I mean come on, you know someone has serious problems so you go out of your way to spend as much time with him as possible? It makes no sence. It is a mindless half hearted novel that could have been way better if Cann didnt ruin it with a really stupid main charater, drugs, the characters constantly trying to get into other characters pants!!! It has a crummy ending too! This is really a book i would not recomend. This is not a good book at all. It is mediocre to the last degree."
5,I LOVED IT!!,"This book is about a 20 year old girl named Rowan who wants to get away from her stressful life in England. So she decides that she wants to work as a nanny in Seattle, Washington. Well that doesn't work out so she runs away with this hot guy to Truckee, CA. This book has a lot of emotional ups and downs with Rowan trying to find love over the summer. I would recommend this only to age 13 and up."
5,"should be called ""American Holiday""","It should be called ""American Holiday,"" because she only spends half of her time in the book in California. If you can get over that fact, it is a good read. It is very descriptive and I felt like I was right there."
1,Are you kidding!!!!????!!!!!??????,"I bought this book because I expected to read some legitimate criticism of Darwinian theory. I find it absolutely hilarious that anyone thinks this challenges anything except for the notion that you can trust the reviews of books on this subject. ""David Stove took no intellectual prisoners"". Right. Just try to read the chapter on ""Genetic Calvinism, or Demons and Dawkins"" . ""Stove's blistering attack on Richard Dawkins' 'selfish genes'and 'memes' is unparallelled and unrelenting."" Oops - they forgot puerile and comical. Don't waste your money! I'm sorry I did."
1,Much ado about?,"The author asserts that Darwinian Evolution concepts do not appear to apply to man, although he seems to believe in evolution. The book is typical of philosophical writing, far too many words for the ideas expressed."
1,Preaching to the converted,"Glad to see you folks marking down this shoddy piece of work - over on amazon.co.uk it scored no lower than a 3 till I got on the case! With its come-hither title and its inner froideur it reminded me powerfully of DB Hart's Atheist Delusions. Neither author appears to harbour much love for his fellow creatures; their books are so ill-tempered they could only convert the already converted or predisposed - and might even put them off! And there was me hoping to have my views put to the test and, who knows, maybe even learn something.."
2,Evolution,"For all you people that just want to protest evolution, think twice and try to understand to what extent science is correct and what is made up. Talk to a genetics professor and they will help you understand how evolution happens."
1,This is not what I expected,"I barely read into the book when I realized that the author is still a true believer of the Darwin fairy tale. It was painful for me to do, but I threw the book in the trash today. Next time I'll be more careful."
4,Makes Excellent Points,"An unusual book. He likes evolution, but thinks the currently accepted scientific explanation for it is bunk. He thinks Darwin was a genius, but thinks Darwinism is retarded. Obviously, this attitude is not going to please anybody at either end of the evolutionism/creationism spectrum. However, I think he raises many powerful points that strike at the heart of Darwinism, and that need to be addressed by its proponents. I am reasonably well-read in this area, and have not seen these issues raised before either in popular books or in college textbooks. Perhaps these points are being (or have been) addressed somewhere in the scholarly literature. If so, somebody needs to get the word out. If not, somebody needs to get on the stick. Stove is dead, so he can't be debated. But he deserves an answer."
3,it could had been better,"some of the songs are great and very popular but other sare not, some of the songs are just okay the sound its poor and thats why i gave it only 3 stars."
4,A classic hard rock cd.,"This cd is excellent, except for ""Hitchin' a Ride,"" which I believe is about suicide. But it's the only filler song I've ever heard of from Boston. The rest of the cd has cool songs, and my favorite is ""Peace of Mind"" and the BIG, BREAKTHROUGH Boston hit ""More Than a Feeling,"" being an extreemly close second. And to think it all started here. In short, I would recommend this cd to any classic rock fan. See 'ya later!Sincerely,Music fan."
5,Something to be proud of if owned.,"I first heard Boston's debut album in the summer of '94 when I was only 11 years old. I remember I was a huge Toto fan back then and asked my dad to lend me some of their records. Dad, who is also a huge rock n roll fan handed me a cd of some strange drawings that I later found out after hours it was guitars as UFO's. That was Boston, their debut album which as soon as I heard the first electric guitar introduction on ""More Than A Feeling"" I just raised the volume up and enjoyed what was for me the bestest guitar sound I had ever heard. Once the song was done since I have a bad habit in playing one more time the songs I enjoy, ""Peace of Mind"" came on, with which its exciting acoustic guitar playing again became a true instant rock n roll classic tune. After that nothing goes down hill and it keeps its high level of rock n roll intensity.One of the best rock n roll albums and debuts of all times and a must for any music fans collection."
5,One of the best albums to come out during the 70's,"This album by Boston is solid on so many levels. The creative interplay between guitars and keyboards with innovative melodies and counter-melodies is really quite remarkable in the genre of rock music. The harmonies are rich and creative as well. 200 years from now when musicologists are studying the music of the 1970's, this album will be studied as people study a Haydn symphony now to study the 1770's."
5,"Been a Boston fan for many, many years.",Love the sound of their first album. It was so fresh and new at the time. As they moved forward the sound became to homogenized in the sound studio and the freshness of the sound faded a bit.
5,SMOKIN' !,"This album ruled the mid-70's.ROCK and ROLL BAND they were!Straight out of BOSTON, playing right out in the street.A lot of great albums were released in '75-'76,this was one of them.If you had this album then, you know the story. No bad songs[truely] here!Many a baby-boomers child was conceived to this album,LOL.This album ""ROCKS"", worth much more than you're gonna pay for it. Best cranked up,great down low too!"
3,Quite a decent album.,"While I'm not a big fan of this first album from Boston (I like Third Stage a little better), I still think that it's pretty good. ""More Than a Feeling"" is the tune that stands out the most. ""Long Time"" is also listenable along with the others. I do admit that I think that this debut from Boston is overrated--that's just my opinion. It's not a classic, but still good. Brad Delp is a good singer and Tom Scholz is a very capable guitar player. The production is also very nice and clear. This debut is decent and has some cool energy and spirit."
2,Standard 70's AOR,"This album can be pretty fun to listen to at times, and the song ""More Than A Feeling"" still stirs a certian emotial resonace in many people.Problem is that this is probably the album that launced the much lamented arena rock phase of the late 70's and early 80's. The ever dreaded AOR and ""classic"" rock radio formats revloved around albums like this, and the music world is NOT better for it."
4,One of the All-Time Best Debuts,"This album is excellent start to finish. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because few albums are deserving of the 5 star rating. Despite being an amazing debut it falls just a hair short of being ""legendary""."
3,enough is enough,"While Boston had lots of success (and we can't deny it) when it comes down to it, these songs have been beaten to a bloody pulp thanks to overexposure. ""More Than a Feeling"" may have been a great listening experience when it came out, but now it's been played SO many times I just wanna scream every time it comes on the TV or radio. ""Peace of Mind"" is right behind it. If I have to hear these songs ONE MORE TIME!!!""Foreplay/Long Time"" is yet another song we've heard more often than not. While I like the instrumental bit ""Foreplay"", the song morphs into a typical, commercially-smooth overexposed nightmare of a song with ""Long Time"". The rest of the tracks on the album are better, but again, how many times have we heard them? Thousands of times. ""Smokin"" and ""Let Me Take You Home Tonight"" are still tolerable, at least.If you're starting your 70's rock collection with this band, it's gonna be a VERY long and mediocre ride."
2,annoying,"this cd is anoying, thats all there is to say. More then a feeling is the a boring song, and MNB, it doesnt sound anything like smells like teen spirit, either you were on drugs when you posted that, or you just hate nirvana so much that now your making stuff up about them. If your not a huge fan, do not buy."
1,Simply Pathetic!!!!,"I'd rather listen to solo albums by Ronnie Hooper or Perry Schmidtz than be forced to hear this entire album. Anybody that says that this album is the best rock album ever must be sniffing crack because these guys and this album definitely suck. Give me a break, Hitch a Ride is joke and is full of simple lyrics and elementary tunes. Try putting this CD on then quickly switching to something by Jimi Hendrix or Pink Floyd and you'll see what I mean. 5 stars? what a joke!"
5,First time I actuallly downloaded music from Amazon,I ususally buy the CD's and then rip to my iTunes. I have to admit it was a great price and really easy to download and add to my iTunes library. I will be looking for downloadable CD's first on future music purchases.
5,Boston,"One of my favorite bands of all time with ""More than a Feeling"", ""Peace of Mind"", and many more. I rank this band right up there with KISS and Led Zeppelin when it comes to 70's bands that really know how to work a guitar. FAMOUS rifts that any rock fan will easily recognize."
5,"If you don't own this, you are wrong.",This album has sold more copies than anyother album....ever! You need this album! Just buy it!
2,what a bunch of crappola,Are you kidding me? Stereo? No multi-channel? The average sound system and listener are not going to be able to tell the difference between this and the standard CD issue. (I realize the average system and listener aren't likely to collect SACD's but thats only a statement of comparison.)The purpose of the medium is to provide a multichannel listening experience. This is just a ripoff.
5,A ROCK CLASSIC,"I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO LISTEN TO MUSIC WHEN THIS 1976 CLASSIC WAS RELEASED. I REMEMBER HEARING IT ON THE RADIO AND A FEW YEARS LATER A FRIEND LET ME BORROW THIS ONE AND ""DON'T LOOK BACK"" AT THE LOCAL DRIVE IN ""MORE THAN A FEELING"", ""PEACE OF MIND"" AND ""FOREPLAY/LONGTIME"" WERE STEADY QUARTER CONSUMERS ON THE JUKEBOX. EVEN 24 YEARS LATER THE ALBUM STILL SOUNDS FRESH AND EXCITING. ALBUM CUTS LIKE ""SMOKIN"" AND ""ROCK AND ROLL BAND"" STILL GET AIRPLAY ALONG WITH THE THREE HITS. IF YOU LIKE BOSTON AND HAVEN'T PICKED UP THE 1980 ALBUM BY LEAD GUITARIST BARRY GOUDREAU (SELF TITLED) THEN YOU'RE MISSING OUT! RECORDED WHILE THE BAND WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THEIR RECORD LABEL, FEATURES BRAD DELP ON VOCALS ALONG WITH FRAN COSMO WHO WOULD LATER END UP SINGING ON BOSTON ALBUMS. SIB HASHIN SITS IN ON DRUMS, SO YOU HAVE THREE/FIFTHS OF BOSTON ON THIS MUST HAVE CD. CLASSIC BOSTON VOCALS AND GUITARS WILL HAVE YOU CALLING THIS THE ""LOST BOSTON ALBUM"" ENJOY!"
3,Prime example of Arena Rock,Tom Scholz's attention to detail and production are in full evidence in the debut album of Boston. Each song seems to have been written with 70's radio programming in mind and on that level the album succeeds admirably. There is nothing here musically or lyrically that will change your life but it still fun to listen to as your driving around.
3,"Structured, nonsubstantive","""Boston"" was a commercially smashing debut album, but while the songs are structured well musically, the song quality is mediocre, unimaginative, and without substance. Even perhaps the best stuff, the soloing on ""Foreplay,"" has elements of clicheishness. I also don't like Brad Delp's wailing vocals. Still, Boston's music has been effective radio fare and attracted a lot of interest."
5,Rock at its best,If your a young person that has not had a Boston cd you should love this some of the best music from the 1980S
3,Smokin' (guitar riff) Smokin ... Ehh 3 and 3/4 stars,"Sounded good to me. This releases' liner notes includes a very interesting history that could not have been written upon the release of this album. Well, it wouldn't have come with the 8-track even if it had or could have, but it couldn't have. And it didn't."
4,Remaster could have been better,"I have to agree with the one and only review who gave one star . This is probably the best album ever and it should have been treated that way . Just by the price alone i was wondering why is it so cheap . I would pay $100 for this cd if it was done right , The remaster is very dull . There was a rush to put out the first 2 cd's because of some bootlegs from Canada . That's a shame . They should have got someone like George Marino (king of mastering) cd's ! Hopefully there taking there time with Third Stage and re-thinking of maybe putting out 35 year special editions of the first 2 remastered the right way ."
5,"Best album of all time -- pure talent and great songs, too.","From start to finish, the best all-around rock album of all time. Brad Delp has a superb voice, and note that this album came out before synthesizers and remixes became the modus operandi. Best track is ""Let Me Take You Home Tonight,"" also dripping with talent and great lyrics are ""Rock-n-Roll Band"" and ""Hitch a Ride."" Boston is still around and puts on a great live show!"
5,Timeless Classic,"Boston's 1976 debut album countering both the Progressive Invasion from the UK and disco frenzy back home became the fitting album to commemorate bicentennial mood and filled the need for Americans to get the music of their own that can be really proud of.Reflecting the 70s when progressive sound was trendsetting, the band uses the state of the art techno gadgets and created new genre of rock'n roll. And they used clean high-toned vocal harmonies to get the better of such synth backings. PEACE OF MIND is the typical of such gem creating the healing of our mind. FOREPLAY/LONG TIME is an excellent coupling of progressive instrumental and feel-good pop music. ROCK'N ROLL BAND and SMOKIN' are the rejuvenated mainstream American pop. HITCH A RIDE, SOMETHING ABOUT YOU also have the impressive high-tone chorus. LET ME TAKE YOU HOME TONIGHT well wraps up this album having both soft healing pop and aggressiveness of prog-heavy rock at the latter part.Essential for classic rock fans."
5,Best Disc Ever!,More than a feeling! This song title explains the monster ballads that flow of Boston's first self-titled release.While other folks wax elequently with a song by song analysis of this timeless album I will keep it simple.Boston will always have a special place in my collection.
5,Rock and roll rarely sounded so good,"This is one of those select albums I have owned on vinyl, cassette, and now CD. Boston's debut was a landmark album, one that has stood the test of time and remains a regular spin on classic rock radio stations everywhere. There's a reason for that kind of longevity: the album is brilliant.These songs are anthems of classic rock. On this album, Boston delivers a powerful combination of intelligent compositions following the progressive rock tradition of the 70's, masterful musicianship, and superb vocal performance. Who in rock and roll has a voice better than Brad Delp??? Who in rock and roll can play music with more energy and intensity than Boston exhibits on this album??? Folks, it simply doesn't get any better than this!!!This album sounded great on vinyl and cassette, but on the digitally recorded CD, it's near perfection. Treat yourself to an unforgettable audio experience: get this CD, put on the third track, and crank it up on high quality speakers!!!"
5,Difinitively the best,If you like classic rock you will absolutely love this album. The remastered tracks are crystal clear and contain some of the absolute best rock songs from the 1970's. Boston has always been a favorite band of mine and i can definitely say that this album is now my utmost favorite. Not only does it contain some of Boston's best songs but they are crystal clear and the sound using a surround system is amazing.
5,"flawless timeless perfect, what more can i say?",i hate when bands start off this good becuase they later tend to crumble and rott. besides this cd and their following album boston just wasn't the same. bands like this is what made rock n roll so great
5,A Must-Have !,Every song rocks! Probably the best ingenue album/CD of all time. A must-have for any collection.
5,Mister C,As powerful as the first time I bought the album in '76. Reintroduced myself as a tribute to the late lead singer Brad Delp. The music still stands!
5,Essential hard rock classic,"Boston rocks! EVERY song on this album has beem played on the radio. Lead Singer Brad Delp has an awesome voice...those harmonies! Boston's debut album rules with an iron fist, plain and simple."
4,Classic,"Boston got and still does get play on my favorite radio station. Peace of Mind was covered by Stryper. Sold over 17 million copies. Key tracks are: More Than a Feeling, Peace of Mind and Rock & Roll Band. I would recommend it."
5,one of the finest debut albums,Boston's debut is one of the best debut albums I can think of.This fine album has sold more than 17 million copies worldwide on strengths of classics like MORE THAN A FEELING and ROCK AND ROLL BAND.Dont listen to the one star reviewers as you will be missing out on of the greatest rock albums.five stars.
4,Still fresh after all these years.,"This album(yes I said album)proved that even PH.Ds can make great music. Few albums can match the consistency of this rookie effort. From the first note to the last, this album nver lets you down. Even though later albums revealed the bands lack of range, this effort has to be among the best 40 minutes to every make it on two sides of vinyl. Tom Scholtz was THE tube amp master and created sounds which seemed impossible from ""primative equipment. On a long solo trip, this one is always in my CD changer. Do yourself a favor. Ignore the negative idiot reviews and check this one out."
3,Two-channel SACD seems second-rate,"Don't get me wrong: I think this is one of the best albums of the mid 1970's. I own it on vinyl and CD -- but the SACD is disappointing. For one thing, it's a two channel mix. Not that stereo SACD's are a bad thing per se, but given the other excellent 5.1 mixes of albums of the same era (for example, ""Hotel California"" on DVD-Audio and ""The Stranger"" on SACD) this disc falls short. Imagine the Boston guitar lines swooping in from your surround speakers. It's not happening here.More than that, for me the disc didn't add much in clarity or impact compared to the original. The soundstage has more depth which serves to isolate the vocals a bit, but there are very few ""aha!"" moments. The quiet passages are the ones that shine -- for example the intro to ""Foreplay"". Perhaps this is all a result of the original mix, which lacked subtlety in favor of a ""wall of sound"" approach. I recommend the disc only for diehard Boston fans."
2,only 2 good songs,"I really don't like boston that much. they are kind of overrated and lousy. One of the worst songs I have ever heard is More thana feeling and i don't get it why people like it. The only 2 goodsongs are Foreplay, and Smokin. The rest of this is junk. I love the cover anyway."
1,The Worst.,"I hate this band. This is the worst corporate crap that ever was, and it's responsible for the shape of current music today. Not that they're the only ones guilty of this crime, but they just get played far more than their horrible accomplices like Styx, Foreigner, and REO Spermwagon. How can anyone like the same song 8 times in a row played 1 million times in any given week on the worst stations on earth. Okay, there's nothing good about any radio station since they're owned almost exclusively by creeps like Westwood One and so forth, but if you still love bands like this and the Eagles, you are either NOT listening to the radio at all (meaning you're a hermit without electricity) or you're under 18. Grow up, get some taste, and leave those of us alone who aren't narrowminded enough to be sucked in forever by the same tired old crap!"
1,sucks to the highest degree.,"the only reason it gets 1 star is because amazon does notgive you the option of 0 star. Boston and other bandsof their ilk SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they are almost, almostas bad as reo speedwagon. so if you are young and impressionableand are reading these reviews to try to devolpe your musicalhorizons, please steer VERY clear of Boston unless you thinkpermed mullets are cool."
1,More than a bowel movement,"This album is like a whole truck of chunky poo! I don't know why I bought this album, afterwards I was so ashamed that I let my dog chew it up. All the over production of Prog Rock without any concept, the worst of both worlds! Do not buy this album it will destroy your musical soul!"
4,Great for seven-eighths of it!,"This is an overall great cd. It's just too bad they had to ruin one-eighth of it by singing about suicide in ""Hitch A Ride."" All of the other songs are good."
3,Where is the 5.1?,"The SACD re-mastering technology is brilliant....when available in 5.1 surround. The question remains...why bother to re-issue classic albums in the SACD format if they are to be left in two channel. Just keep that already ""re-mastered"" version you bought a couple years ago that replaced the original CD version you bought a few years before that. I've got 3 different copies of Dark Side of the Moon by now on CD, as well!"
5,can't wate to by this,"oh man, i lov boston dude they so rock i used to have this on tape but som pesron stole my box n my tunes i am workin at the locle statio to get up enoguh bucs to pay for som new tunez and som cold bevvis. i usd to ditch skool to listn to this and stuf with my buds what a time. BOSTON RULZ"
2,Sounds like a CD,Don't waste your money on this SACD! It's basically a CD in disguise. I love Boston though!
5,Great 70's/80's Band=Great Album,"Very good tracks, has my favorite ones on it. I love ""More Then A Feeling""! All of the tracks are worth listening too."
4,Zeppelin Garage Band,"I stumbled across this group in the record store one day and instantly became a fan. I hate to beat the Led Zeppelin comparison the ground (based on the reviews of their other album) but I imagine this is what Zeppelin would have sounded like if they had formed as a teenage garage band. The songs are rawer and less polished than Zeppelin but there is no doubt that many of the guitar riffs have a distinctly Jimmy Page feel to them. My favorite songs are probably ""Frank"", ""Arrived"" and ""Negro Spiritual"", but I enjoy listening to the album all the way through with out skipping songs. Plus, you have to love any band that writes a song paying homage to the Dukes of Hazzard (i.e.""Hazzard Co.""). If your a fan of early Zeppelin rock, you will probably like this album."
2,Disappointed,I am a collector of Better Homes and Gardens older cookbooks which most are wonderful. I have at least 20 of them. I was planning a luncheon and to my surprise there was nothing of interest in this cookbook. I generally like re-introducing the older recipes. I guess this one will just sit on the shelf and collect dust.
3,Easy Recipes for Fun Meals,"BH&G;'s LUNCHES AND BRUNCHES has been around awhile (1963), but the menus and recipes are old favorites that can be whipped up in a hurry when you see unexpected visitors turn into the drive way.Need a show off dish to please a crowd, you'll find it here and still have time to enjoy the party.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
3,Too bad that it has to run Vista,"The hardware has great spec's for the price, but if you have never encountered Vista before, you will be amazed at what a dog this is."
4,A lot of Bang for a few Bucks.,"Compaq Presario SR5050NX Desktop PC (Intel Pentium D Processor 925, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)After loading all of my programs and data from my old pc, I thought my 3 year old All-In-One printer was history after reading about all the compatability issues. Right after I hooked it up the pc directed me to download a patch from hp (hp all-in one) and it worked fine, no compatability issue with me! The pc is a bit noisy when I am burning cd's, but it is so quick the sound doesn't last long at all. With my old pc (HP Pavillion P3), this is a huge and most needed upgrade. It is quicker and quieter than I was used to with my old one."
2,"One of the better Debbie products, but that's not exactly saying much...","Too much chocolate, but I don't think it's necessarily an over-sweetened product, like the other ones.I guess it's OK for what you're getting, but it doesn't taste like a REAL, homemade brownie.Try them if you want, you may like.2.5 stars."
5,Toro makes great snowthrowers and has great customer service!,"We have the 6.5hp version of this Toro Snowthrower family and it does a great job. We tried a couple other brands also and the Toro was the only one that did a good job of throwing snow 90 degrees to the right/left of where you are going (like when doing a driveway). The other brands just sort of dribbled the snow out the chute when the chute was at 90 degrees. It starts easily, runs great and spare paddles/scraper are reasonably priced. And Toro Customer service is really excellent and quick. I would highly recommend Toro Snowthrowers.We've now had this Toro for 2 seasons and used it quite a bit this past winter. It started first pull every time, did an outstanding job on dry snow or wet snow. The only drawback is that it has a lot of vibration but with big winter gloves on it helps reduce the effect. Overall a really great snowthrower and highly recommended."
2,TORO model 2450 GTS Snow Thrower only good for LIGHT SNOW ONLY!!!,I bought the TORO model 2450 GTS single stage 5hp manual start. It is only good for light fluffy snow.....NOT HEAVY SNOW!!!! If you get pounded by the great lakes snow.....get a 2-stage!!!My belt from the TORO model 2450 GTS single stage 5hp was sqeeking all day on the HEAVY SNOW ...the HAND SHOVEL was the only solution.BUYER BEWARE.....only good for light fluffy snow!!
4,"A little bit of 'Quantity over Quality' here, by putting the two first releases of this band together but still real good effort","Really should be three-and-one-halfout of four, but with amazon.com'srating scale as liberal as HitleryClinton. Fervor would be three starsby itself and Lost and Found, a greatdriving tape/CD almost four by itself.I'll split the difference because Ilove these guys as a band and bump itup to four out of five. Look for Jasonsolo live in a town near you, checkout his great website and buy allthese you can from amazon!"
4,Nice little vac-sorta bagless,Works well on Hardwood/pergo type floors. Small and light for doing carpeted stairs.It only only gets 4 stars because trying to find replacement screens/filter seems impossible. Thats right like many bagless vacs it has a filter and screen.
3,Gets the Job Done,My old reliable canister died and I was trying to replace it. The Sanyo is the best of what is available but they don't make them like they used to. The Sanyo has good suction and works well on my hard surfaces. The hose is a little short and not very flexible. The canister is lightweight and tends to roll over so it is best to hold it while vacuming. It would be nice to have tool storage and a longer electrical cord. It would be good in an RV and that is where mine may end up if I find something more substantial.
1,Does not pick up everything,"I got this vacuum cleaner because my mother swore it was the best one out there. However, when I used it on my carpet, I didn't think it did a good job picking up all the things on the floor. I have a pretty low carpet so it shouldn't have been too difficult to pick up the dirt....but this vacuum cleaner did not really work. When I tried to vacuum an area that had little bits of crackers on it, it only picked up about 85-90% of the mess. It made me think what else it wasn't picking up when a visible piece of cracker was still left on the carpet. I ended up buying another, higher powered, vacuum cleaner."
5,The Skinny Pill Changed My Life!,"I heard about the Skinny Pill from a radio interview, and I was skeptical at first. But I ordered the book, I followed the program, and I saw results immediately. The diet program is the easiest thing in the world! The meals Edita outlines in her book are simple, smart, and sensible. When combined with the pill, the results are miraculous. I started taking the pills and following the food plan last month. I have lost 17 pounds in 30 days. I am not kidding. I don't feel sick anymore. I have lots of energy. I have more self-confidence. I am happy. Plus, the skinny pill ingredients are all natural so I don't have to worry about chemical reactions or side affects. If you have a weight problem read this book. Do what it says. You will lose weight. I did."
1,The Skinny Pill,"I thought this was a weight loss book but as I read I found a claim that It was not. It was a fat loss book. I read the book, took the pills and lost no weight. You have to stop eating to lose weight. Unfortunately there is no magic pill and this is a waste of money."
4,Practical care of red-eared slider and painted turtles,I want to see the video because it is very important for me!I think it is full of informations that i need!!!
1,"Misleading Track Listing, BEWARE!!!","I purchased this CD SPECIFICALLY for the Green Court Remix of ""Dear Jessie"" which the Track Listing says is included on this CD. The version of the CD I got does NOT HAVE THIS VERSION (instead it has Mark Oh's Luv Song Remix). I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in this, as that's the SOLE reason I purchased this CD. Keep this in mind when you order this CD. The track listing also has 1 or two other song substitutions on the CD from what is published on Amazon as well.Otherwise, great CD with lots of fun, bubble-gum trance songs from a very cute singer with a tremendous voice. Great CD insert filled with lots of color pics...and it's even got some Japanese text/inserts throughout as well to liven things up."
5,This album kicks!,"I'm a big Ultra Lounge fan, but this album is really special. I can't resist Gorme's 'Frenesi', Darin's 'Charade', Bennett's 'With Plenty of Money and You', and Wilson's 'Lot a Livin to Do'. I can't really resist any of the songs. One song, in particular, is a real wacky, anachronistic whopper--Snootie Little Cutie. I make all my friends listen to it. The other songs are timeless."
5,For swingers and lindyhoppers alike!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this collection! As an avid lindyhopper, I was afraid that this volume wouldn't be as dancable as the first Wild, Cool & Swingin' collection. There is a wide variety of tempos on this CD, from the energetic '5 months, 2 Weeks, 2 Days' and blues-dancing-worthy 'Daddy', this CD lives up to its title. Even the songs that aren't 'dancable' are a delight to listen to."
5,Good Disc for someone looking to expand past F. Sinatra,Good variety of songs that move right along and keep you tapping to the beat - excellent song quality as well. If you like 40's style music - this one kicks!!!
5,Don't Miss These Great Vocal Hits,"It took me a long while to decide to get this CD, because I suspected that vocal lounge music would be too schmaltzy--that is, would lack the punch of the instrumental stuff on the other CDs. When I finally decided to get it (after reading the other reviews here), I was very pleasantly surprised. The highlights include ""Charade"", ""Angel Eyes"", ""It Had Better Be Tonight"" (one of the three bonus tracks), and, best of all, the two tracks by Louis Prima (Oooohhh-Aaaaaahhh!)."
2,A disappointing sequel,"This volume of Ultra Lounge has some good songs on it but compared to Wild, Cool & Swinging, it just cannot compare. This is my least favorite cd of the series."
3,Great deal,The traveler container doesn't look at all like the picture - it seems smaller and has no handle and no graphic on it but it has a wriststrap attached by a carabiner. It has only 6 slots for the game cartridges and a stretchy net area to hold the rest of whatever. It's fine for the price and well constructed. I have no complaints.
2,bulky and not cool,this is gigantic. You could fit two DS' in here-if that's what you're going for. I don't know what male or female would really like this once they got it. And for the people who complained about their sons getting pink: STOP MAKING YOUR CHILD LIVE WITHIN YOUR GENDER-COLOR RESTRAINTS!
5,Great For The Finicky Eater,"I bought this book some time ago and use it often. I found it easy to use and very complete. Good recipes for the finicky eater and most importantly healthy for them!! This is not in the book but something to consider as to why we should feed our pets home cooked foods. Before the end of WW2 and the start of commercial dog foods, dogs where fed from the table eating most what we humans eat. Back then dogs lived well into their 20's. Now if they live to 10, 12 years it's concidered old!! Something to think about as we feed our dogs commercial foods and vaccinated the heck out of them!"
4,Very helpful,"I would read this book as a companion with ""The nature of animal healing."" This book is very easy to read and gives you a basic understanding of diet & health and it does give you some great recipes with easy instructions. But I would not rely on it soley. Read it with ""The nature of animal healing"" and you will shock your vet with how much you have learned and you two can actually have a serious conversation about your pets health...you may even be able to teach your vet something! Mine in fact purchased both of these books shortly after I spoke to her about them! (thats kinda scary actually...)"
3,Great nutrition and sound advice,I liked the nutrition information in this book and the recipes have everything for a healthy dog. I found most of the recipes too complicated--I did not want to cook gourmet meals for my dogs. The recipes are for a specific weight. I have two dogs: 50 lbs and 100 lbs. It was hard to make one recipe for both. I took the ideas of the recipes and make my own. I tried taking the fresh veg/fruit in the blender and my dogs did not like it. I cook the fruit/veg together with meat and they look the food!
1,You're better off feeding your dog kibble.,"If you're remotely educated about canine health and nutrition you would know that the majority of the staple ingredients used in this book are not remotely healthy for your dog. Twenty percent of dogs in the US already have or will develop some kind of food allergy in their lifetime and the biggest culprits just happen to be CORN and WHEAT. Even if your dog is part of the 80% without food allergies, these ingredients are filler carbs used way too often in this book. The protein content in these recipes should be much higher. Of course your dog will like this food, try giving your dog any food that is packed with carbs, dogs are like humans, carbs taste good but will also make them fat."
2,Real food for dogs,The Ultimate Diet : Natural Nutrition for Dogs and Catsby Dr Kymythy Schultz is better.A Animal Nutritionist should be better at telling a person what to feed not a Vet who learns nutrition from Purian. That is like Hersey or Nestle telling people Drs about nutrition.
1,DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE CHEAP BROKEN LIGHTS,"The last thing I like to do is drive out to some shopping center and battle traffic to buy anything... so I thought I would give this a shot. Unless you like the idea of buying cheaply made products that come with 2 broken bulbs, then stay away from this item. Go out to one of the big home improvement stores and take a look at what you're buying.This product is like the stereo systems you buy from the guys in the van that don't have any speakers inside the cabinets..."
1,Cheap material,"I had to drill out the bolts that held the lighting fixture together. The bolts refused to budge, and the phillips screw was damaged beyond repair."
5,Wonderful Insights and Connections,"I've learned more from listening to this two cd set than all the reading I've done on enneagram over the past several years. The presentation is a recording of a lecture given to professional therapists to aid them with patients, and yet the information is presented in such a clear and yet visceral manner that anyone can benefit. The Fauvres present the 9 personality types based on their personal/professional experience and research with such personal passion; they flesh out the 9 types in a way that each type comes to life. They provide the listener with the language and the, visual references used by each type, how we can be confused by ""look alikes"". I learn something new each time I listen."
5,"Poppy, yet deep and meaningful","This is a truely great song. Sure, the tacky cover may make it look like a top 40 wannabe, but believe me, it isn't.This is a song that talks about your events in school and graduating e.g ""Where we're gonna be when we turn 25."" ""When we look back now will our jokes still be funny?"" ""Will we think about tommorrow like we think about now?"" ""And suddenly its like we're women and men."" ""Will these memories fade when I leave this town! ""The music, which is mainly violins, has an almost haunting quality to it, and Vitamin C has a great voice which suits the music and its lyrics perfectly.The chorus, though it is short and simple, is also deep and touching:""As we go onWe rememberAll the times we had together.And as our lives change, come whateverWe will still beFriends Forever."""
2,A Waste of a Good Premise,"Who is this book written for? It doesn't seem likely that the young adult crowd is far enough removed from such kid stuff as the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew to appreciate a fictionalized back story of the ""authors."" On the other hand, the simplistic writing--especially the lumbering dialogue--is ill-suited to a nostalgic adult audience. With a less than compelling plot, this ends up a pale shadow of the books it pays homage to, and seems to exist primarily as a labored exercise in name-dropping. There's plenty of alcohol and some oblique sex--more casual ""realism"" for our young adults--although none of it is necessary, and little of it rings true. Based on the premise, I hoped that this might be a good read for middle-schoolers. Unfortunately, it's not a good read for anybody."
3,clasp broke,"The watch worked well for the first three years. Unfortunately, the clasp broke right after the warranty period. This is surprising because the watch wasn't worn often."
5,Beautiful,I bought this a gift for my mom. She loved it. She really liked that it didn't have a battery and it is a beautiful watch. It is slim and a very classy piece.
4,Its blue!!!!,"Great watch for the money. I just thought the face was black online, but it is blue. however my girlfriend loved it so 4 stars."
1,Not Worth It,"I almost think the other reviewers must have some sort of interest in selling this DVD. It's almost completely worthless. The ""approximate"" running time is 90 minutes but when you play it you'll see that it's just five separate 9-minute segments and some additional interview material from some of the people involved in making the DVD. There's not a lot of ""new"" footage; maybe a very short video clip here and there and a few rare photographs. And of course each of the 9-minute segments repeats a significant amount of material used to introduce the segment, which is obviously just a cheap way to add running time to the DVD. The only good thing to be said about it is that many of the people interviewed did have some association with the Beatles at some point in their history, but unfortunately they don't really have anything insightful to say. Just stuff like, ""Yeah, John was a bad kid in school,"" or ""When George joined the band he was much younger than the others."""
5,Great DVD,"This DVD has many rare film clips,photos of the FAB 4 with unseen interviews of people who had worked and knew the ""BEATLES"".VERY INTERESTING & WORTHWHILE."
1,pink velcro rollers,"These things are, at least for me, a nightmare. I am an experienced roller user and these things tangle in my hair like no other roller I've ever used."
4,No Doubt-Bathwater,"The third single from the band's 2000 album Return Of Saturn. ""Bathwater"" is as ska and pop as ""Spiderwebs"" and ""Excuse Me Mr."", but somehow not as memorable. Still, its a No Doubt song all the way, though not as strong."
2,NOT organic,"Many people buy this shampoo thinking it's all natural, and I read some other posts about loving this ""organic"" lotion, but it is not organic. I purchased some thinking the same thing, and promptly returned it when I noticed some of the ingredients, including alcohol. It is 70% organic with other chemicals thrown in. California Baby products are truly all natural and only a bit pricier than these. Plus, they smell great too."
4,a kids review,"The other guy who wrote that review obviously knows that an uzi can be a side arm. Then why does he insist in calling this the perfect side arm for a side arm? Also, my friends gun (this one) lasted him a couple of months couse it got slow after a while, but i still recomend it couse it look so darn cool, and its fast and acurate ( im usings my dads acount)"
4,Its ok,The gun shot for 6 months of little use and then started at 30 fps and jammed. Buy it as a starters gun; this was my first. It makes a great sidearm if you already have a shotgun or uzi.
2,thermostat guard,"Unfortunately, I needed one of these due to a family member who wouldn't stop messing with my thermostat! I installed it quite easily, and it seems secure. My only complaint is the key is extremely cheap--when I went to unlock it the key bent and almost broke off. Now if I want to change the setting I will have to rip it off the wall!"
4,Musical Masterpiece,Ever though it is an import CD I enjoyed it. The sounds and songs were magnificent. I would reccoment it to anyone who likes Sailor Moon.
2,Not That Wild,"Bridges and Smith are mismatched as a pair of city cops who stumble onto a plan of mayhem hatched by a hate group. This film is a hodgepodge of action/adventure, buddy movie, social commentary and comedy. None of these elements work well together in this film. Bridges' father gives a good performance as the head of the hate group, though. Also watch for two of Bridges' kids in small roles."
3,same old same old but still entertaining,ther's nothing new here this is very formulaic but can be enjoyed bridges surrprised me and was good
3,Short Stories About People I Know,"Since I'm retired from the Police Dept., Laurie Drummond's stories held a special interest for me. It's fun to try to recognize some of the people and events that you had been a part of, in the not so distant past."
3,ARMED AND DANGEROUS IS BETTER,"If anything You Say is your cup of tea, (and I liked it a lot) then you MUST read ARMED AND DANGEROUS by Gina Gallo. It's head over heels better. These are two books from talented women but Gallo's ARMED AND DANGEROUS book comes from a lady cop who has done REAL police work for REAL. Take it from me, a retired police Sgt. and enjoy!A.M."
2,Female officer finds book unrealistic,"As a 15 year veteran female police officer of a large city, I looked forward to reading this book. I have not read a book about working the streets from a female officer's point of view . After reading this book, I still have read a decent one.From the beginning the book's prose sounded forced and fake. The sometimes stunningly flowery descriptions sounded like a college student trying to impress a teacher. I was suprised to find that Drummond had actually been a cop, as the accounts of the female officers being involved in shootings, dealing with dead body calls, ect. sounded like how a civilian thinks an officer would feel. Overall, I was disappointed by this book, and would not recommned it to anybody. There are better books about cops out there."
5,No Velcro!,"Unlike some others on the market, this all leather case has a harness type holder to secure your Clie instead of Velcro. The fit is tight but since it is leather, it will soften and ease up a bit. Snap strap closure, again no Velcro. Only room for a few business cards or a credit card inside. A small package. It works for me."
3,More S & M than Sex Frolics,"Although tightly plotted with well-drawn characters, this book focuses more on bondage, domination, whips, canes and verbal abuse rather than hot sex. In fact the ""members of the corps"" are forbidden to have ""regular"" sexual intercourse with each other. So if you're hoping for steamy male-female sex scenes, keep shopping. If you're into paddles and crops, and occasional female-female sex, you'll probably like it."
3,Shape of Their Hearts,"Off of their new album ""Black and Blue,"" The Backstreet Boys have released their first single entitled, ""Shape of My Heart."" On this imported CD single there are 3 tracks. The first is the album version of the title track. Instead of adding some remixes of the song the next 2 tracks to follow are an acapella version of ""All I Have To Give"" and a remix of a previous single, ""The One."" This CD single is a MUST for the backstreet boys collector;however, just buy the full CD to get your moneys worth."
3,Incomplete,"Needs ""Every Time I Think of You"", ""These Times Are Hard For Lovers"" and ""Tears"" in addition to omissions noted by other reviewers. I like Waite's music, but like most of us I learned about him through his radio hits and those are three that should be on any disc claiming to be complete."
5,CHF Patient Bible Written for the Layman,"My mother was diagnosed with CHF and I immediately purchased this book for her. She considers it to be her bible and she consults it frequently. Without it, she would have entered into a serious illness alone guided only by her doctor. Now she has a chance to help herself through very difficult times and we her family can help her, too."
4,Heart failure survival,"Although much of the information in this book was given to me at the hospital, it is an excelent review and fills in an abundance of additional stuff. The ""whys"" and ""what to do"" and prognosis are given, along with encouragement. It covers the present stage of cardiology and delves into the future advances. Specialized sections, like for caregivers, is indeed helpful. There are directions for getting additional information from books and on the Internet. This is the last additon that Marc Silver intends to write. He states that so much material is showing up on the Internet that a book is not needed. The problem with information on the net is that it is scattered about at different sites, so get the book while still in print. I recommend it."
5,Helping to cope with heart failure,I have been researching several pieces of literature and books regarding CHF.This book was my first choice. I was not disappointed. The book was in pristinecondition and it was exactly what I was looking for. I was extremely pleased.
5,Great practical guide in simple language!,"A helpful resource in understanding heart failure - the stages, the emotions, options and how to cope with this disease from both the patient's & family's perspectives. Very informative!"
4,Pro- Informative and Fun Con-Puts down certain groups of ppl,"I really liked Jeff's book. It gave me ideas for an upcoming election that I will be running in. The only bad thing is that it put down ""popular"" people and ""cheerleaders"" and ""jocks"" saying they usually won't win elections. I found this disturbing because I am a cheerleader and I think that we have just as good of a chance at winning then the underdogs. I took much of the book's advice and really enjoyed it except for that one aspect of it."
1,Newt Gingrich &Bill Clinton do it; now your child can too,"The priorities are totally messed up here. If a parent wanted their child to grow up to be Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton, this might be a good place to start, but it doesn't really have any clue as to what is important. The author seems to have exhibited his priorities by putting his own reviews on Amazon's readers reviews. Both of the five star reviews date from long before the book was published."
1,This book will make you a social leper -- fast!,"Although the author has clearly done a lot of boning up on the subject, it's also clear that he's drawn the wrong conclusions from the evidence, and his book, while amusing, is unintentionally so. High School is not the beginning and the end of the world, and social popularity is not a matter of overwhelming concern -- at least to anyone who wants to consider himself an adult. I wouldn't recommend HOW TO WIN A HIGH SCHOOL ELECTION to anyone who wanted to avoid becoming a social leper."
1,Exciting Lighting Wall EZ Sconce,"These produce very, very low light. They look cute but are non functional. Don't expect them to provide any useful light for the room. Also, to change batteries the lamp has to be removed from the wall."
5,"Great watch, perfect size","I just opened my box from amazon and I'm delighted with this watch. I had purchased a wenger watch and it turned out to be much bigger than I expected. This is a perfect, small size to wear comfortably. I like the easy to see day and date and the second hand. It also appears the hands glow in the dark. The band seems a little cheesy, but no big deal. I'd definitely recommend it unless you like larger watches."
3,Beautiful watch - for the petite...,"This watch is really beautiful. I have worn Seiko watches for decades, and never had a problem with this, but this watch is really small. From the photo, it looks proportionate to the other Seikos I already own. I did not connect the metric measurements to equate to such a miniaturized version ... my mistake. If you are petite with tiny wrists, this watch would be a good choice."
4,Fine watch.,"I was suprised to see how nice the watch was.Not to big,not to small.Not for party,but a fine working-day watch.The color-setting is quite delicate!Thanks!!"
4,Great watch but not for me,"I ordered and received this women's Seiko but was forced to return it and buy a watch with a larger face. The return was easy, since it was Amazon, and I bought another watch via Amazon.com.I made a huge mistake before buying this watch. I did not note the size or diameter in millimeters. I was surprised at the small size of the watch when I received it. Even with glasses, I could not see the face well enough to see the time. It's a shame, since it's a lovely, high quality watch.I highly recommend the watch, unless you are older and like me, are having vision problems."
5,Fantastic debut!!,"I realize I'm not the first one to discover this, the first offering from Poland's Decapitated -and I do own all their other albums but man, this was a excellent way to start off! Apparently they were pretty young when they recorded this, but it does not show. They approach the music with a maturity that belies their true ages.If you're looking for a great tech death album, I would highly recommend this. Excellent production, well recorded, well arranged and played."
5,Decapitated - Winds of Creation,"This cd is BRUTAL. If you are a fan of this genre and the sound clips sound cool, pick this up. The fact that this cd is the product of a band whose average age was about 20, this is crazy. Every aspect of the music is killer; the riffs/solos are top notch, the drums are brutal and precise, and I LOVE the vocals. Decaptiated and Behemoth are about as good as you can get for death metal vocals (both happen to be Polish). This cd never gets boring, every song does NOT sound the same, oh yeah and the Manditory Suicide cover is better than the Slayer version. 5 out of 5 if there ever was one."
5,I love this album!!,"Decapitated's sound is sure an brutal sound of art---you can't go wrong here...Actullie, when i first heard winds of creation, i didnt quite know what to think but then i listing to it over & over which was a good idea!Pretty much every song here is original and do not sound alike at all!This is by far extremy music as its best! buy it!!"
5,Brutal!,"An amazing & brutal release from ""decapitated""... Very impressive sound, as well as, the production, all in one! The best songs here to me are, the album title "" winds of creation"" , ""blessed "" & , ""way to salvation"" over-all ? Worth the buy, no doubt about it. If your a fan of deathmetal, and feel like listining to a solid sound...Don't think twice, just buy it!"
4,Fast and Heavy,"Good CD, my only problem is the drumming. He doesnt slow it down enough to give the songs dexterity, but ohh well. This is still a solid release from Decapitated. Kick some A--!"
5,Kataklysm wish they were these guys,"Why this album is so overlooked is disgusting. This is definately my second favorite death metal album of all time (Effigy of the Forgotten is first), and it just makes it seem even more ridiculous that these guys were 16-18 years of age during recording, considering that talentless trite like Chimaira and Metallica cant come up with anything non vomit-inducing and they are 2-3 times their age.All the songs are my favorites; its a flawless, perfect record up there with Pierced from Within and Clandestine.Fans of Krisiun, Suffocation, and Immolation will love these guys."
5,My Head Exploded,"""Winds of Creation"" is an excellent and phenomenal debut album created by a band whose average age during recording was 18 years old. The drumming is excellent, Sauron has quite a set of lungs to produce such angry and deep vocals, and the guitar work and technical song structures will leave you in awe and wanting more. Decapitated delivers all of that in ""Winds of Creation"", and they prove that Poland still delivers some of the finest death metal. Recommended."
4,Whorecoming,"At first this play seems like a good absurd/kitchen sink 60sEnglish play, with the usual dysfunctional family characters. Itis that but with the character of Ruth, things get really weird-evenfor this group of people. They're a pretty perverted bunch, but I stillenjoyed the play. Though Ruth stills seems like something prettyunexpected, but that's what the theatre is sometimes all about. IfI were Ruth I'd get back to the USA ASAP."
1,Weak,"Quite displeasing, featuring a long sequence of arbitrary and unpleasant action, revolving around characters that are even more simplistic and unappealing. The dialog fails to be very believable, and fails even more at being rhetorically appealing. I'm left baffled by Pinter's fame and critical success, and am thoroughly uninterested in reading his other material.Worse than: The Sad Tale of the Brothers Grossbart by Jesse BullingtonBetter than: Hylozoic by Rudy Rucker"
2,The Pinterview,"I would very much like to resist the temptation to call him a buffoon, but clearly Mr Pinter was. His play demonstrates a man so obviously isolated from what he was writing about, that he was writing for the sake of shocking someone. That's clearly not the point of literature. Banish Max, Ruth, Lenny, Teddy, Joey and that godawful Sam to Hades. Finally, I'd like to end with a priceless quote from a rather senile acquaintance of mine, Michael Cristobal Fletcher, who remarked in a lecture that Teddy is ""basically a nice bloke"", to which someone replied ""even though he did sell his wife into prostitution?"". Cristobal was baffled, morosely."
3,Cheese Cloth,I was disappointed because I thought the weave would have been closer. It reminded me of cheese cloth you would buy in the grocery store.
4,Great Dance CD,"This is a must-have for any dance-music lover! Trance and Popular combine on a three cd set so you can pick out your favorite style and just relax. It's got a Spanish title, but it's mostly in English. You'll love this cd."
5,Great Sailor Moon music!,Wow! This CD is really good and a good buy if you want to have all openings and endings with movie themes on one CD without changing discs. Well you might on another but that would be the Memorial Disk and that's very expensive and very hard to find so this would be a great buy.
1,Not received.,It is very hard for me to review this book because I have not received this product.I have paid for it so it's kind of irritating.
2,Unreadable,"I can't believe the ""translator"" Seidensticker is a ""professor of Japanese"" at Columbia Univeristy and a noted translater. Besides the English being stilted and awkward, Seidensticker failed to understands Japanese culture. To make an old foreign classic understandable to English speakers, the translator must not just translate verbatim. It is the translator's job to preserve the elegance of the original while making it understandable to foreigners. Seidensticker failed to do either. The result is a book that failed to preserve the beauty of the original and makes little sense in English. He seemed to be not only translating ""out of sight, out of mind"" as ""invisible madman"" but also ""someone wrote it down in short hand"" as ""someone with short arms, small hands, and tiny fingers wrote it down."" It is unbelievable that a reviewer gave it a 5 star rating. It must be someone who had equally little understanding of Japanese literature and not very demanding in good English writing."
2,not feeling the love for Genji,"given that it's ""the first novel"" I'll not award only one star, but... lordy this book is repetitive and dreary. I occasionally pick it up and read a wee bit at random and for a little while can enjoy, but that seems to be the only way to appreciate. I recall having an argument about whether the first piece of computer music which I think was by ben johnston was any kind of music at all, in fact, and have to shake my head at peoples' self delusional capacities to hold this novel as being ""still one of the greatest"" as it's value seems mainly in the accident of its initiation of an inevitable long form of prose literature"
5,Best Book Glen(n) has ever written.,Would like to read more from Glen(n) and his talented brother Wayne.
3,3 Men on a Bummel,"Liked, but I thought 3 Men in a Boat was better. It was still amusing though, and had some god comic mpments."
2,Three men - Two stars,"Three men in a boat is a fantastic read - the mix of comedy and adventure is perfect and it captures the Victorian era to a 't'.I therefore had high hopes of the sequel, Three men on the bummel. Unfortunetly I can not praise it. The laugh aloud comedy element has given way to, at beast monologues you smile through, at worst, ones you want to skip. The adventure is in short supply and doesn't sit well with the comedy. A real shame."
3,Very difficult to chew,"These have a great taste, but I agree with another reviewer that they are hard as a rock and very difficult to chew. I bought these at my local supermarket and have no reason to believe that I got a stale bag, which a comment to another review suggests as an explanation for these being rock hard.If in fact some people get bags where the candy is easy to chew, that means that there is an quality control problem, and I am not interested in taking my chances on getting a ""good bag"" even if I can return a ""bad bag."" I prefer just to buy Kraft Caramels, which don't have quite as strong a taste, but always have been easy to chew."
5,"Werther's Original Chewy Caramels, 5.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)","hard to find 20 words to describe this product...product as described and can't beat the price when purchasing in this quantity... needless to say, anyone who has ever tried these know they taste great...only problem is they don't last long in our house..."
3,Stunning photographs suffer from poor presentation,"Laura Wilson's photographs are truly extraordinary. I first was introduced to them by a recent essay on the PBS News Hour. The few photograps that were shown left me mesmerized and eager to see more. The presentation of the photographs in the book, however, is extremely disappointing. Rather than helping the photographs, the layout gets in the way. Several of the best photos are split between two pages ( e.g., the photo of the women on the haystacks is split 75%/25%). Also, many of the photos are blown up so large that graininess becomes a significant problem.Laura Wilson's photographs deserve a far better presentation than they are given in this volume."
5,Well written book with superb B&W photgraphy.,"-This book could easily qualify as a very readable ethnography of Hutterites and is a great example of the beauty of Black and White photography. It explores the Hutterites alternative lifestyle and shows how they very sucessfully coexists with modern American culture.Highly recomended, many large pictures taken and reproduced with superb craftsmanship."
2,Inadequate room in trifold wallet,"This wallet is made of quality material and well put together. However, it is not usable for me because there is not even half the room for stuff as my old wallet. If more room is needed than for 3 or 4 cards and 3 or 4 currency bills it is completely inadequate."
1,Never Shipped,"I ordered this item in the middle of November for a holiday gift. Plenty of time right? As of a few days before Christmas, it still hadn't shipped so I had to cancel the item."
3,The product is good but is missing one thing must be closed in the middle of portfolio,"The product is good but is missing one thing must be closed in the middle of portfolio so can be opened easily and also rise if the door portfolio mobilized inside cards or cash, in case reindeer"
1,Not what I remembered,"I checked this one out from the library last summer to read to my four-year-old. I remembered from my childhood some of the illustrations, but had forgotten that the story is actually quite violent and creepy. I'll not be buying it, nor reading it again."
5,Asian and not offended,"As a child this was one of my favorite tales. I am of asian descent and I was never offended by the images. I didn't find it scary, just fascinating. It was a tale that really let the imagination soar. People should be racially sensitive but not paranoid. In this era of cultural diversity, we should be able to see the humor. The caricatures are innocent not disrespectful. I feel bad for children whose parents feel the need to censor this from them. It is a fun, timeless story I plan to share with my children."
4,Good book,I remember this story from when I was in grade school. I thought it was a fun story then and I think the same thing now. I look forward to sharing it with my children.
5,Classic Childrens Book,This book is a classic and every child should have this story read to them. It should be in every classic story collection. One of a handfull of books I remember from when I was a kid.
5,Great book to have growing up,I think it's funny how people get really sensitive when things aren't depicted politically correct. I remember when I was a child reading this book. The depiction of the characters just told me they came from an asian country and no more than that. I loved how each brother had unique and interesting characteristics about them (one brother can swallow the sea! How crazy is that?) and I loved to see them outsmart the people trying to execute first brother. It's just a wacky silly book that any young kid will enjoy.
5,childhood favorite,"this was always my daughter's favorite book when she was a child. it has been difficult to find, especially in hardback. she was thrilled when i gave it to her for christmas."
3,A blast from the past,This was one of my favorites as a child. I bought it for my child. It was a trip to go back and read.
5,The Five Chinese Brothers,This is a splendid children's story...the one out of all stories that I remembered vividly from my childhood. I continually give it to all my family and friend's children and their children as the next generation comes along.
1,Five Chinese Brothers,"I ordered this book for my granddaughter because I remember enjoying it when I was young. The story is still a good one--having the wisdom of a folktale. However, upon reading it in the context of this age of ethnic sensitivity, I realized that it subtlely conveys the notion that all Chinese people look alike (thus the brothers were able to ""fool"" the executioner), which is definitely a racial slur. The illustrations also portray the villagers in ""crowd scenes"" as cookie cutter cutouts of the same image...no fat, no thin, no short, no tall...all the same. As charming a story this is, we must all take a good look at ways that we pass on ""racist"" notions to the next generation...even in seemingly innocent ways."
1,Be careful of this book.,"FIVE CHINESE BROTHERS follows many stereotypes of Chinese. From Chinese people looking alike (if you flip through the pages you'll see that not only do the brothers look exactly alike, but so do the rest of the Chinese people!), to Chinese people being peculiar (the special powers that the Chinese brothers have make them look silly and rediculous), and how Heathen Chinese civilization is (you see the many torturous punishment the brothers go through).... Furthermore, folktales of China don't come close to the stories in this book. Bishop made up this story without any authentic text of China. If you want your child to read this book, he/she may end up stereotyping Chinese people. Please, don't let your child grow up like that."
1,This is a CHILDREN'S book ?????,"I will strongly diagree with most of the reviews here. This is not a classic, this is a horrific book for a child. Let's see, the story starts with a boy drowning just because he did not obey. Then FIVE times we see a death sentence attempted to be carried out on an innocent person. And the moral of the story seems to be that if you are found guilty, try to trick the judge. Sorry, this is not something that will be in my house."
3,A fairy tale from China.,"I have no idea how Chinese the tale of THE FIVE CHINESE BROTHERS really is. But it takes the form of a myth or fairy tale. It could be scary, I suppose, but all fairy tales are scary. This is a fun story, and I thought it was unique. Then I discovered the book THE SEVEN CHINESE BROTHERS, which is NOT a sequel but is based on the same story (see review of that one). The differences: this one has a mama, has simple black and orange illustrations, and an older copyright date of 1938. This is a nice fairy tale, but I recommend the other, more modern and colorful, book more highly."
2,Confusing Covers,"I was looking for a specific edition of the book I ordered. Although I clicked on the illustration for the edition (1974) I wanted showing the correct blue cover, another one was sent (white cover). Since it was a sentimental purchase, the book I received was very disappointing.And, when asked to write this review, the illustration of the book cover was, once again (you guessed it) blue!! Very misleading, very confusing, very time consuming, very diappointing."
5,I love this book,I remember this book from when I was a child and I purchased it for my 4 year old's birthday. She wanted it read again and again and loved telling everyone else about it.
5,A Classic Piece Of Literature For All Ages,"I recently began thinking back to my childhood and I pondered all the wonderful books I read as a child. Many, many books filled with tails of wonder and adventure yet only a few stand out in my mind still to this day. The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Curious George series, James and The Giant Peach and all other Raol Dahl novels, and yes the 5 Chinese Brother. I recall many accounts of my trips to my local library and going straight to where they had books on microfilm and this was one of them. I would sit there for hours reading it again and again. The whole theory of this book being non pc is obscene. It was written in 1938 you know before Leave It To Beaver and we certainly don't think that is PC in our standards today. It is a great book that should be read by young children everywhere who always thought what if I could be a star, astronaut, president."
5,Excellent Children's Book!,"When I was in grammar school, I read this book so much the pages started falling out! It lets your imagination soar. I have lots of great childhood memories surrounding this book."
4,Works so far,I'm still evaluating but so far it meets my needs: maps for hiking & kayaking. It's essentially thin plastic sheets. Doesn't fold easily. Works well with laser printer.
5,"WHAT AN ALBUM, WHAT AN ALBUM !!!!","It's amazing how this recording sound fresh even nowadays, 26 years after its release. The production in incredibly clear and fresh, the guitar sound is perfect, Scott's voice is captured at his best. THe opener ""IT's A LONG WAY TO THE TOP"" is an all-time classic, played almost entirely in the key of A !!! LIVE WIRE comes next; It has the classic THE JACK also. A chuck berry's cover is also present. The album is a pleasure to listen, I think even for those who doesn't love rock. It was clear, from this album, that AC/DC was destined to be great."
4,this album is a mix of classic hard-blues and AC/DC tipical,"Young, Scott & C. plays their music at the best. This is the first album from this Australian band, but it is one of their masterpiece."
2,WTFH?,"this review is a warning to any ACDC fan who doesn't like being ripped off, and I think that covers just about everyone. first, this really doesn't concern the music... anyone who owns High Voltage with the Angus/lightning bolt cover has all but two of these tracks, and one of those is on Dirty Deeds... this review is about the outrageous prices! c'mon, people, how much will you pay for one unreleased song?! at the time of this review, it's priced at 42.92$USD. WOW? another odditiy about this Amazon offer is that it offers at a discount the Int'l version of High Voltage, which as I said has all but two of these EXACT SAME SONGS... oh kay...... hope no one is slow enough or stubbornly determined enough to buy the thing anyway, but if you are, Why not download the Aussie version tracks [School Days, a so-so cover of the Chuck Berry standard; and 'Rocker', which was featured on the Int'l version of Dirty Deeds] and be out 2$ instead of 42$?.....just trying to help...."
3,"Good Music, Overpriced CD","This album, TNT is the Australian version of the American album, High Voltage. TNT is really the same album but does not have two songs High Voltage(US) has on it, Little Lover, and She's Got Balls are not included on this CD and are instead replaced by the songs, Rocker, and School Days. Bassicly you could just buy High Voltage(US) and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and spend around 18 dollars on those two CD's or you could spend 33 dollars on a nine track CD with really only one rare song in the US, School Days. TNT is only for the huge AC/DC fans who need every single recording ever made by the band, of course School Days would of been better too put on the EP Jailbreak 74."
5,Todd,If you are a Bon Scott fan or Brian Johnson from AC/DC buy this import. Im an a AC/DC fan this is a great Import cd to buy.There is alot of good stuff on here if you are tired of hearing the regular Ac/Dc tunes on the radio this cd is for you .
3,Someone please answer,Someone please does this have the full version of High Voltage (that goes up to 4:22 and not 4:03)? If you have the international High Voltage the songa It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)and High Voltage are editedand on the 2003 and 2004 release of TNT (CD)contain the edited version of High Voltage fading out at 4:03. The 3 stars is just to get this up there.TNT (Reis)
4,Expensive!!,"I bought ""TNT"" IMPORT on CD in the early 1990's. It only cost me about $20.(USA) Why $71.00 for some CDs? But anyhow, I already got this, and it has almost all the songs from High Voltage, with one from Dirty Deeds CD. 2 songs are missing that would complete High Voltage. Little Lover, and She's got Balls. But, this has the rare ""School Days"" song, making it worth getting. Rocker is included."
5,Loved it!,"Even as a child, I've never been a huge puppet fan, but ""Davy Jones"" changed that. Maybe because the film-makers see puppets in a different way. ""Davy"" is made with wit, wonder and intelligence. It never speaks down to children (unlike so much kid's fare), and has plenty to offer to adults, too. Like most kids, my five year old likes to play a video over and over. ""Davy"" is the only one we haven't had to set a limit for. (I'm by him on the couch for every showing.) And the script is so good that my wife and I quote lines of dialog at least once a week. Davy has been described as a children's classic. It is. But you could drop the adjective: ""Davy"" is a film classic, pure and simple."
5,A Rare Find,"This book is MARVELOUS! It is almost the only book on Ancient Tree usage, it is the only one I know of, but his bibliography gives a few books that I've not seen nor read. THis book covers all the ancient Mediterranean world, from Lebannon to Cyprus to Greece. He actually wrote this book over a span of nearly 40 or so years, so it is very well written. Obviously not the sort of book that everyone may think is interesting, but it is and it is because Mr. Meiggs is a very good writer as well as scholar. If you can get ahold of this book it is worth the read."
4,Great book but the audio CDs...,I purchased the audio CDs seperate when I found out they don't come with used book that I bought. The book is exactly like what is shown but the CDs do not seem to comply with the second edition of the book that received. I am dissapoint. If anyone knows where to find second edition CDs then please let me know!
1,Tainted Product,"I ordered this product a few months ago and it was great. Then I ordered another batch a few weeks ago and it was absolutely fowl tasting. They sent me another batch but it also was horrible. I am not sure what happened but this bulk supplier is offering an unhealthy, unedible (possibly health damaging) product. Look elsewhere!"
5,All-in-one digestive aide.,Excellent quality! Mixes in water very well. Thickens quickly.Its good for constipation or diarrhea. It brings your digestive tract back to normal using all natural ingredient.
2,THE MOVIE WAS A LOT BETTER!!!,"To be honest I was very disappointed with the book. Maybe it's because I watched the movie first and then I read the book. I love the movie, it's one of my favorites, that's the reason I decided to read the book in the first place. I thought books are always better then the movies, but in this case I was wrong. In the movie they changed a lot of the things, but in a better way I thought. If I was you I would just watch the movie, don't waste your time reading the book."
5,Beaches was an exelent book. Two thumbs up.,"This book is about two friends, Cee Cee Bloom and Roberta White, who met durring their childhood and stay friends until Bertie dies. The book is so real. You really get into it. A couple of times, I even wanted to slap one of them. You'll definatly cry in the end."
3,Good but.....,I finally got a hold of this and have to say that it was a quick and very engrossing read. Am I the only one however to notice that the biggest thing these two women had in common was their appalling taste in men? I found their relationships so degrading that it was hard at times to keep reading.The fate of the one decent man in the book is a tired and rather stupid bit of emotional manipulation generally used by writers who don't have Ms. Dart's writing ability. She could have done better than that.I'm not sure if I'd pick this book up more than once but I'm glad that I read at least once.
3,"I'm on the beach, I don't need to bend the brain to much.","I was getting ready to head down to the beach for a few days and saw this at the store. I watched the movie when I was growing up, but had never read the book.Unlike most cases, the book was not as good as the movie. There, I said it. But I've read worse and I was lolling around on the beach anyway, so the theme was appropriate."
2,Poor condition for a used paperback,"I found the book(one of my favorite beach reads) hard to read on our vacation due to the condition of this ""used"" paperback. In fact, this was the first time I never finished the book. Also, the first time I ever bought a used book from Amazon, probably the last time. rrf - luv the Beach"
4,pretty canisters,"We have had our Sango Nova Blue dishes for 5 years and the only time that any have broken was when we moved across the country or dropped them on the floor! These canisters can be cleaned in the dishwasher, something I appreciate, and they are very pretty.The seal is not 100% tight against humidity, so if you live somewhere very humid and you have things like brown sugar in these you will need to combat the humidity if you don't want a solid block."
4,Beautiful canisters,"These canisters are a great addition to my kitchen counter and look great with the other crockery I have. I did remove the seals as I found the lids a little difficult to remove with them on. Nothing I store in them has to be air tight, so it worked for me. They arrived in perfect condition - packed adequately."
4,good but a bit small,Love the looks and durability of the canisters. The lids seal extremely well and keep the contents fresh. The only way that this product could be any more user friendly would be for the smaller two canisters to have more capacity. Enjoy!
4,great,I've read that these canisters usually arrive broken or shattered. This set arrived in great condition and we're very happy with them.
4,canisters,"These canisters are a perfect match for my new counter top. They have one small problem. The smallest one""s lid does not fit as snug as it should. As I use it only for my sweetner packets it is ok. Over all I would recommend this product. Good buy for the money."
2,break easily,I bought these canisters and when they arrived the smallest one was broken during shipping/delivery... so it went in the trash... After a week I went to get sugar out of another one and as I put the lid back on... a piece of the canister cracked and little bits all fell into the sugar... again it went in the trash... They look nice but if they break this easily looks dont matter.
4,Sango Nova Brown Canister Set,Canister set is a good size very pretty. One canister is an odd shape so lid is hard to put on. All and all I do like it.Nova Set of 4 Canisters - Brown
3,Another Sango product that's not properly packaged,"These canisters are very pretty, but... due to poor packaging, the items are likely to arrive broken. If you are lucky enough to receive them undamaged, the sizes are nice, although the smallest one is a little smaller than I'd prefer. My only real complaint about the product itself is that there are no spoons in the canisters to make them more convenient to use."
4,great!,"Although worried if they would come in one piece, they came perfectly intact, are fairly good sizes and look great. The only thing I noticed is that the largest canister is slightly off color from the rest. But overall- very happy!"
3,Nova Cannisters,"Economical, pretty solution for cannisters. One of them chipped when placing the cover on it. That is why this product only gets 3 stars from me. The chip doesn't show so the cannisters are perfect for the spot I wanted to put them in."
5,Beautiful Set,"YAY!!! I was one of the lucky ones who received this set completely intact & I couldn't be happier. I hesitated because of the large number of people who received them broken, but after not being able to find the canisters in stores (as I have a number of Sango Blue Nova pieces) I decided to chance it.I have no complaints about the canisters themselves; they are sturdy, I have had no problems with the seals (although they were obviously made to fit a certain way) and I love the color! However, I am amazed that they got here in the condition they did because they were not exactly packaged well. One would think that after having such a large number of issues with customers receiving shattered pieces they would bulk up on the packaging materials. But definitely worth taking the chance!"
2,cracked canisters,the canisters are great looking and I would have loved them in my kitchen accept after receiving two sets of them broken they would not ship me anymore so needless to say I still don't have a set they told me to order another color well that wouldn't work in my kitchen and after all there still ceramic what makes them think I wouldn't have this problem again. Not knocking the product just the way of shipping it
2,Broken,"I too received my shipment very quickly, however the largest canister was broken and am now having to ship the whole set back."
1,"Sango Nova Blue Canisters, Set of 4",These are packaged so badly from the factory I can't see how you could ever ship these and receive them in unbroken condition. I asked them to ship one canister seperate and the 2nd mailing they were almost all broken. They are a beautiful product but I will have to wait until they are purchased by a local store.
5,"Lovely, and arrived in perfect condition","My mother chose these for her kitchen. The product arrived well packed, with no defects whatsoever (contrary to much older negative reviews from 2004-2006). FYI: The largest canister holds about 4 pounds of flour (not a standard 5 pound bag)."
2,Not worth it,Saw these canisters and fell in love with them. Couldn't wait to get them and when I did they were broken into a million pieces. They replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal doesn't fit properly. Another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off. I was disppointed in the quality. I wouldn't buy these again even if I had to buy something more expensive.
2,Okay,It was not the best book I have read. I would have put more information in the book. I liked the information it did have.
5,Nice spoon,I bought this spoon to use boiling peanuts and it works great. The long handle is very nice for stirring stuff in a deep pot.It is also sturdy enough to use stirring a big pot of stew.
4,OVO is classic Peter Gabriel,"OVO shows all the signs of Peter Gabriel's musical genius. It still smacks of cheesy musical on a few brief occasions, and that's the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars. If you're a fan of Gabriel's later work, you'll enjoy OVO plenty."
3,worth a listen,"For the most part this CD was a lot more laid back than expected.(A lot of it's too quiet too hear). If you're expecting a new PG solo album, this isn't it. I got the feeling I was missing whatever live action was going on at the millenium dome while this music was playing. I do like the integration of musical styles from around the world. Listen with an open mind, and this is a good way to expand your musical interests. I'm still waiting for PG's next solo album, but in the meantime, this will do."
3,Ovos only,"Ovos a strange concept album. Its only a Peter Gabriel album in as far as The Tarzan Soundtrack and Voyage Of The Acolyte are Phil Collins albums (dont let people fool you into otherwise). This is not a real Peter Gabriel album but merely a collaboration with others some choices of which fail (good thing this is an import, could you imagine the reviews Peter would get appearing on an album with an artist as bad as Nineh Cherry). Gabriel does not sing all the songs (infact only 3) or preside over the album the way he did with his studio albums, live albums and soundtracks as a prominent and passionate arranger/musician/songwriter. Their were still 2 years left until Peter Gabriels first true album after 10 years Up when this import (which is uninspired enough to feature a poor remake of Digging In The Dirt) came out. But still what works here works well."
1,An Un-inventive Evolution,"&#65279; Strange to say but this import only disc may be the first of Gabriel's to deserve deportation. Gabriel's half of his collaboration with Mark Fisher to create a complete musical/visual/dance experience for London's Millennium Dome, isn't necessarily bad or boring, it's un-inventive, a characteristic one never levies on the ever pioneering Mr. Gabriel. Though `Ovo' has its moments - `Low Light', `The Time Of The Turning' the quietly hopeful `The Nest That Sailed The Sky' - they are too few and too far between. And what does the far in-between consist of? Mostly routine martial and rap/dance rhythms (`Ovo', `The Tower That Ate People','White Ashes') and new age balladry (`Father, Son', `Make Tomorrow'). One would hope the story of man's evolution would have a few more tricks up its sleeve."
2,not good,I found this album a real dissapointer. There are some good musical moments there; there are some good performances from PG and Richie Havens- But if you are expecting a follow-up to any of his other albums- you will find this to be a let down. There is no depth musically or lyrically like on his past albums- and as being the millennium show the music already seems dated!
1,A poor attempt,"After seeing the Millennium dome show I hoped that this video CD would be better and more insightful. Sadly its unashamedly biased ""green"" fairytale coupled with simplistic graphics and a music soundtrack that was less rich and varied than the original show make this video CD only suitable for small children of ""Guardian"" newspaper readers."
3,"OK, but not what I was expecting.","This is what I thought I was getting when I ordered this book for my 8 year old: a address book for her to record her friends' contact information, as well as share with a few of her closest friends and have them to fill in pages of fun quizzes and questions about their favorite things. What I got is a book with the same two pages printed over and over again, enough for 48 friends to add their info. One page is ""All About Me"", one page is ""My Favorite Things."" I guess I thought there would be more fun pages for her and her friends to fill out. There's no way she's going to get that much information from 48 people. Not to mention that, as another reviewer noted, the last line on each ""All About Me"" page asks ""I know God loves me because..."" which is no where mentioned in the description. My daughter has told her friends they don't have to answer that question if they don't want to. It would have been nice if that was part of the description."
3,This is supposed to be an address book - not a religious book!!!,"This is a great book for kids, and my daughter is excited to have all her friends fill it out. EXCEPT as another reviewer mentioned, there is a line on every page for each child to complete the statement ""I know God loves me because...""There's also a page in the back, telling the children they should ""ask Jesus to come into your heat and be your Best Friend."" I have spent the afternoon putting labels over the God statements, and had to remove the last page as this would be extremenly offensive to her friends who practice other religions. Just a warning because there was no indication when purchasing this book that there was religious content. It's easy enough the cover up the statements. In fact, we used our own labels to create a line that says ""My plans for the summer..."""
1,Religious references are inappropriate,"I was very excited at the idea of giving this book to my stepdaughters when they went to camp so they could easily exchange address information with new friends and get to know each other better.Each entry (to be added by their friends) ends with ""I know God loves me because""... I know that my stepdaughters have friends of varying religions and backgrounds and personally, I find that offensive. There is also an entry near the back all about Jesus and how much he loves you and the different ways you can allow him into your heart. There is a handy dandy address where you can order your own Bible too!This is an ADDRESS BOOK. I am returning this because it is inappropriate and as a child, not exactly a way to show your new friend that you are open and accepting of them no matter who they are, now is it?The description of this book is misleading and hopefully this review will be helpful to others either seeking out religious-based materials, or hoping to avoid them."
2,"Fun to paint, but not that functional","This is a cute, complete kit, fun for kids to use. We first covered ours with outdoor acrylic paint (bought separately), then used the included paints on top.Unfortunately, the opening at the bottom of the birdseed hopper is so large that all the birdseed spills out of the tray. We tried several varieties of birdseed, including sunflower seeds, but the opening is just too large.I suppose you could nail a large gauge mesh screen to the bottom of the hopper...but it would be easier to just purchase a more functional, ready-to-paint birdfeeder from a craft store."
2,Not a Best Of Collection at all,"This is not a ""Best of"" collection, as the title suggests. In fact, there is not a single one of their hits on this thing. Great band, but a misnomered CD."
4,Not for beginners..,"I'm an experienced ""clayer"" and I loved this book. It was full of inspiration and really great ideas for me. However, if you're just starting in polymer clay art, it does use a lot of advanced techniques and assumes you already know what you're doing."
1,Gorgeous book but NO RESOURCES and useless without ...,"What a disappointment! It calls for things like front surface mirrors, a 3/8"" diameter clear acrylic ball, a copper tube and lamp check ring of specific dimensions, a plastic lens with a focal length of 2.625, cyanolacrylate glue, etc. - but gives NO hint of where to purchase anything. I never looked so hard for anything, but the info just isn't there - and, without it, the book is useless. Too bad; it would have been wonderful had it included at least a hint of where to buy things we've never even heard of before"
4,Standard work on the Stuarts in France,"The Stuart saga began in Brittany, moved to Norfolk following the Norman conquest, and then to Scotland via that country's hereditary stewardship, but the consequential connection of the Stuarts with France starts with Sir John Stuart of Darnley. King Charles VII made him Constable of the Scottish Army in France and later created him Seigneur d'Aubigny in gratitude for his military successes against the English; he also was allowed to quarter his personal arms with those of France. Sir John's descendants became, at various times, the earls of Lennox and Richmond. And when the Stuart kings of Great Britain began their exile in 1688, where else had they to go but to their cousins in France? A well-written, well-documented history of a little-studied branch of an ancient family."
5,A Masterpiece,"There are certain books every student of clinical psychology should read. This is one of them. This is Searles at his best--a classic. Not only does this book take you through the psychological maze of schizophrenia, it also guides you through the interpersonal dynamics of being a clinician working with seriously disturbed populations."
1,"Anthony hair ""cream""?","Product has the consistency of a liquid, not a cream. Making application very difficult. I have contacted Anthony to determine if the product I received was defective, with no response."
2,"Didn't protect well, came apart","This won't protect your PDA in your pocket, and it doesn't allow you to synch it in a cradle. Furthermore, I took it in and out of the case a couple times and it was already coming apart. Oh, and it was well-nigh impossible getting anything in and out of the pockets.It would be nice if someone would make a good Tungsten T case that really protected the PDA, and didn't leave holes for lint."
1,Bad buy...,"Truly a poorly designed case:* no syncing in cradle with case* not all parts are leather; the essential part that holds the Palm in placeis made out of plastic-> far too narrow, does not bend enough* once my Palm was in there, I could hardly get it out againI was not happy with this buy !"
2,some good...some bad,"While the leather portion of this case is well designed, the clip mechanism leaves a lot to be desired. Within a month of receiving the device, the clip mechanism broke because there wasn't much plastic holding the spring in. Unfortunately, it wasn't easily repairable. As far as the case goes, it was initially a little difficult to get the palm back out for syncing, but after a week or so, it was no longer a problem."
2,Second time slump,"After a smash Latin-based hit like 'Livin the Vida Loca', I found this comeback single rather disappointing (indeed, its failing to burn up the charts). Despite its' peppy overtones and Martin's dreary attempts to spice things up, it slumps midway and never really recovers (the same can be said of his new album as well).Perhaps Martin needs different songs and different songwriters, for this CD single lacks creativity and is utterly uninspiring. Naturally, this will also find buyers galore as Ricky has built up a solid fanbase, but in terms of musical content, 'She Bangs' is half-dead, and ultimately boring. And thats certainly something that we didn't expect from Ricky Martin.This is the Import version of the CD single, and it costs a bunch. I wouldn't buy this unless I were a true blue fan, as the version thats on the radio is quite sufficient, thank you. Not at all recommended."
1,"Rating about the ""Myframestore"" - just a cheap frame, poorly packaged","Unfortunately, the frame is cheap -- and that would be okay if it arrived in one piece, but it was boxed poorly and the veneer on the wood was cracked and shattered. If I lived closer to a walmart or target (less than an hour away) or have a more flexible schedule, I would just buy one locally."
3,"Decent book, but could've been better.","I bought this book for my 7 year old daughter because I wanted her to read about how Sister Bear stood up for herself and didn't follow the crowd. I do think that this book is decent, but I feel that it missed the mark for showing and telling kids how to stand up for themselves. Queenie McBear was a new girl in town and was snotty, rude, and self-centered. I wish that the book would have demonstrated Sister Bear asserting herself and standing up to Queenie in a positive way instead of feeling bad that she was left out of the fun. Most kids would feel bad that they were singled out, but I feel that kids need to learn how to be confident, assertive, and happy with who they are. This book just didn't do it for me."
3,"A decent book for the topic, but not Berenstain's best","My daughter is in a preschool class that is already very clique-ish. I picked this book to help her see that it's not nice to be in a clique. The storyline was OK in accomplishing that, but still lacked what I was looking for. However, I haven't found a better one.It's especially hard to find books that teach kids that being the ""cool kid"" is not cool if you are excluding others. I think this IS the best I've found at dealing with that. Most of the books on bullying and excluding others are written for the bullied kid. My daughter IS one of the ""cool kids"" and I'm trying to teach her to include everyone. I'd like to find a storyline with a kid who stands up for other kids who are picked on and is therefore the ""cool"" kid because of his/her generous heart."
5,Great Book,Sister bear has friends and they meet up with the new cub and the new cub makes fun of SB and SB gets clothes just like the new cub but decides she wants to be herself and not let the bully get to her.
5,"Jane Fonda Prime Time: Trim, Tone & flex","New workout is so great. Makes me feel more stretched,I love it,Jane Fonda Prime Time: Trim, Tone & Flex"
4,Jane Fonda Tone & Trim,This is a good DVD to tone and trim your muscles. It gives you the choice of working your upper body or your lower body at different times or all at one time. It provides gentle exercise but also giving you a good workout.
5,Jane ages with us--and is wonderfully open about it!,"An excellent job, building in just enough push to get our blood moving, but not enough to exhaust us old-timers. Jane is pure Jane, no posing and no primping. She freely admits her own physical weaknesses, and isn't perfect. Great job. This DVD is just what I was looking for--something much like Silver Sneakers. Now I can do the workout at home."
4,Practically Perfect!,"This is a great way to get back into exercising without overdoing it. I have had a back injury and wasn't sure what was the right approach. These workouts are gentle, yet effective. I guess I left off one star because I hoped that since Jane Fonda had had some replacement surgeries, that she would address injuries more than she did. But as it's always been with her fitness programs, the instructions are clear and it's easy to follow."
4,Solid approach for self improvement after 50,Fonda's Trim Tone & Flex is a very very good exercise cd for the older crowd. It is gentle in its approach but also stressesagility and muscle strenghthening--both very desirable qualities in aging bodies.
5,2 basic & light workouts for the graceful,"""Jane Fonda Prime Time: Trim, Tone, & Flex"" DVD contains an upper body and a lower body workout. It is designed for those who are at a graceful age. The idea is to maintain muscle and bone integrity, flexibility, prevent arthritis, to keep mental clarity, to improve balance and other health goals. Ms. Fonda works with three other graceful ladies through moderately paced, light and gentle basic workouts. For some people, these are light or beginning workouts. Light dumbbells, a chair, and a mat are the equipment needed.Upper body workout (about 24 minutes)Warm-upOne arm rowFront raiseAlternating shoulder pressBack workBiceps and balanceTriceps kickbackShoulder/back workAb workSupermanModified push-upPlankStretchesLower body workout (about 17 minutes)Ankle, leg warm-up, shin workUp and down the chairCalf raiseSquatSquat hold with front raiseLungeHamstring curl, to rear workKnee workStretches"
4,"Jane Fonda Prine Time: Trim, Tone & Flex","I've used Jane Fonda's workout tapes before and as I have grown older, I find that I can still use them effectively."
5,Happy,This web site made it vey eay to order and my orders are sent quickly and had no problems I would recomend
3,have it but not watched it yet,"I greatly admire her fortitude to design exercises for seniors. I certainly don't have her body shape. She also suggests additional weights etc. and demonstrating them so I felt like I had to have them to get into this. Therefore, the DVD is now resting quietly with the rest below the tv."
1,Not For Me!,Just a total waste of money. There is nothing new here that she hasn't put in most of her former DVD's.
1,Jane Fonda DVD,"This cd will not play on my machine,( it is a new machine) all it is saying is ""wrong region"", I am going to complain to Amazon."
5,great,what a good excercise this new tape is and easy too for us older girls. thank you jane. it is easy to do and perfect for doing it alone or with a friend. it makes me feel great so i do it several times a week. thanks again.
5,Has been a favorite in our house for 3 yrs,"My daughter got this as a gift for christmas when she was about to turn 2. She is now about to turn 5, and still plays with it every day. Little people is the perfect first little doll house. It is built so very durable, and there are so many other wonderful little people sets that you can buy to add on to your city. It is also great b/c it travels well. It just folds right up. She has a huge little people village right now. When she grows out of it, I know it will be perfect for her little brother, (he is just year now). I love that it is durable enough to last her 3 yrs of heavy play , and we can still pass it down."
3,And Okay Dollhouse But Not The Best,I suppose this is a good first dollhouse. But I prefer the other one by Fisher Price that is one of the first dollhouses for your little ones. I bought both of them for my daughter and she doesn't play with this one very often but she adores the other one. I think that its quite crowded and doesn't do a lot. There isn't much room for little hands to manuaver around in.
5,Durable toy set,"I bought this toy house for my daughter's first birthday over two years ago, and she is still playing with it. Although not any more with the Little People that came with it and the additional ones that we bought to complement the set. The play house is really durable and still functions well. The sounds were useful to teach children about the different noises encountered within a house. I gathered that the new toy version does not have the sounds which came with the older version. I do not know what noise the new toy version makes; for me it was a worthwhile investment. My kid plays with it everyday with her Polly pocket dolls."
4,Great little Doll House,"We've had this toy for years - it was originally given to my daughter when she was 2 or 3, she is now 5 and will stay play with the doll house and little people and so will her younger brothers. It's great for their little imaginations!"
4,Little people house,Too cute! My daughter (18months when I bought it for her) loved it so much that I bought another for her cousin (20 months) who loved it as well. I have also recommended this toy to friends as a worthwhile purchase.
3,works great but doesn't have all the sounds that were expected,"We have done some research on the internet and our impresssion was that it'll have washing machine sound, door bell sound, etc. But all you get is phone ring, cat, and baby crib sounds."
1,It needs a bit more....,"I just got this house for my daughter that is 22 months, she likes it, but it does not hold her interest too long. she might play for 5 min. and that is it. The reason I find, is that it needs more of what they call ""house sounds"" it only makes 3! sounds and that is all, the cat says miau, a baby says mama, and the phone rings.... that is all! It also lacks of more colors or details.I was expecting a bit more for what I paid and I am sure my daughter too..."
5,Fun for a toddler,My daughter received this for her first birthday and wasn't really interested in it until she was 18 months. Now she loves it and plays with it all the time. I love the sweet sounds that it makes and is helping with potty training with the flushing of the potty. I would definitely recommend it for a toddler.
5,Great Value,My son loves Thomnas Trains and these DVDs are priced well. Received on time and continue to order many others. Great product and he enjoys them over and over.
1,tnfo,was not able to use on my samsung phone was not clear to me that said product would not suit my needs
5,Wonderful book!,"This book is incredibly informative and also fun to read. The presentation of the material is very clear and concise, and the case studies are fascinating. I enjoyed reading the textbook so much that I actually read ahead, which I can't say happens in very many of my other classes! This is a terrific book and well worth the price."
5,WHAT FOLLOWS ARE COMMENTS FROM THE AUTHOR,"I would enjoy hearing directly from anyone who has comments or questions about the book. I have been working for nearly a decade on a biography of Charles Greene, the older of the two brothers, and would be curious, in return, if there interest is in such a book. In this book just published, GREENE AND GREENE MASTERWORKS, I HAVE incorporated much of the new research I have done these past ten years -- you will find here a focus on the life of the Greenes, on their relationships with their clients, which I hope will give a deeper understanding of their individual works as well as to the style they so beautifully developed. I will look forward to hearing from you -- Bruce Smith"
5,Superb,This is one of the most enjoyable books I've seen. It came recommended by a woodworking instructor in Southern California.
5,I had no idea...,"The book was used. So what! I had simply no idea that homes such as these in this book, ever existed. These homes are akin to living in 'art'. Not a museum, but actually living in art. The years in which these homes were built obviously heavily influenced both Frank Lloyd Wright, and J.R.R. Tolkien in their future works that we now know and love. Greene and Greene, if they are not the fathers who inspired Wright, then they must be very close uncles. And as for J.R.R., Galadriel would easily move from Lorien to move into one of these homes. Or in the least, these were her 'weekend get away' cabins. Either way; beautiful, simply beautiful!"
1,What?,"I wanted a specific compostion by Pergolesi, and I received this.It is not as indicated on the cover. I wish I had never ordered this."
2,Not enough bricks!,"I bought two fifty piece sets for my son. I was very disappointed to find that only 8 out of fifty pieces were eight point rectangular bricks. The set includes 26 four point squares, 12 two point triangles, 4 four point triangles, and only 8 rectangular bricks. It's very frustrating to build with these blocks because the tiny blocks don't have any spanning capability. The slanted pieces are only useful to top off. The blocks are soft, so they don't lock like a hard plastic lego. These blocks don't join well, and there are too few bricks, so it almost impossible to make anything creative. This is honestly the most disapointing and expensive purchase I have ever made. The rectangular bricks are not available for purchase separately."
5,fun for adults too,Miss Patricia and I were at the Macy's doing some shopping when we came across these puppets I stopped and put on the cop one and she the surgeon and out she came (meaning the playful side of her) and it was so much fun as she did some bit as though she had practiced it with the surgeon biting my nose and then she did some other cute thing. It was so much fun and to see her smiling and of course I'm smiling whilst writing this and remembering. I purchased the surgeon (hopefully she's not reading this) and I'll have to have the video camera ready when she opens the box on Christmas - ho ho ho it's a fun great gift you know!
3,Murder Mystery covers up a sermon,"David Mauel should stick to writing about the natural world instead of trying to add his feelings and opinions onto a murder story. The action doesn't occur until so far into the book that one is left wondering what the mystery is. Then he spends so much time going through all the details it gets tiresome. The descriptions are fine, although I am not familiar with Cape Cod, but his writing style would be more fitted to a document in a magazine. There was so much opportunity to make the love between Andrew and Laurel beautiful, but he just dropped it in. Read it if nothing better is handy. I read it only because I agreed to give a report on it for our book club."
5,"Brother, can you spare the time?","I would truly like to spend some time with Brother Bartholomew, the engaging amateur sleuth in ""A Matter of Roses"". Preferably over coffee at Norma's Café where his mother waits table and keeps tab on who is saying what about whom in the Cape Cod community of Eastport. I would ask Brother Bartholomew about what the building craze is doing to the pristine Cape Cod I knew and loved many years ago, about life in an ecumenical religious community and, of course, about dastardly murder. These are just some of the buds and thorns of ""A Matter of Roses"". The story is real enough that I can't be sure whether Brother Bartholomew is a creation of David Manuel or if David Manuel is the good Brother's nom de plume. In either event, this cerebral sleuth in his modern-day monastary is anything but cloistered as he tracks down the murderer in this nicely-paced novel."
1,"Boring, out of date","This is book is old and dated. No longer relavent in todays world. I was trying to find a good series, but this is not it."
5,works great till you drop it,"I had to put bubble wrap around it cause I kept droping it. I love this timer. Dont drop it. I'll turn on the water sprinkler and make a timer so I wont be watering the interstate. I'll put the humming bird water on to boil and put a timer on it. I can record what each timer is for...""turn off the water"" turn off the water""....I used to set timers and would go...what was that timer for? Now I can set timers and record a message with each timer. and if you walk outside and it goes off, it still beeps when you are back inside and you see a blinking number and can press it and hear the message again...this timer has saved me money."
4,"Oh, nostalgia...","This is what my country does to its people: it tortures them, kills, deprives them of most basic human rights, violates them - and all the while immigrants cannot forget their homeland. That is the basic premise of the movie: immigrants returning to the Soviet Union to live in what they believe in now a changed country. Alas, change is apparent, but that isn't the kind of change they were looking for. Years and years of struggle, inability to change their life or get out of the country once they were allowed in - you don't want to try it yourself, but watching this movie helps you realize how many things you take for granted on a daily basis."
3,A great movie for people who don't know how much russians suffered under communism.,This is one one of the best movies never made about the life in communist Russia.
2,Please enter a title for your review,I picked it up because of Colbert and Gaffigan's names on the cover figuring if they chose to be involved in it it would at least be creative if not funny. It's just slow and boring. Another formulaic attempt to find beauty and tragedy in the minuitae of everyday human existance. The characters and situations are more developed than those in 21 Grams or Coffee And Cigarettes but not as much as those in American Beauty or You And Me And Everyone We Know.
3,Subtle comedy,"The Amazon review gets this film just about right, but that doesn't help its lack of comedy. You won't chuckle at this. A wry smile is maybe the most rise it may give you. Made in the wake of 9/11, it tries to comment on how that made things different for a diverse group of New Yorkers. Each storyline is separate and doesn't overlap, so it keeps cutting between them all, picking up the pace as the film progresses. I thought the two Indian security guards were funniest, one of them unbearably wound up, the other relaxed and eccentric. If you need a point to your movies, you may miss it here, but the film develops an impact as it goes along, if you don't hit eject first."
4,An examination of city in the grip of stress and fear,"If you are looking fo a linear narrative, you'll be disappointed. But, if you want to see great acting, and a story (or stories depending on how you look at it) that is so much more than the sum of its/their parts. The entire premis of the film is laid out by Tony Shaloob (the psychiatrist) minutes into film and it manifests slowly on screen. The end of the film does not leave the individual storylines neatly wrapped up, because that would it be realistic, nor would it reflect the overall attempt of the film to represent ""reality""."
2,all over the place&just ok,"saw this movie over the weekend and just didn't get where it was going. very Woody Allenesque influenced with the New York Multi takes on people's lives. but it felt very superfical and never got to the point it was trying to make or prove.the post 9-11-01 take again left a mix message and while this film had some interesting ideas, it just never got fully off the ground. a twisted ""ordinary People"" type of take if you will that just didn't go anywhere."
2,The attempt is more impressive than the result,"This movie is disjoint, at times shallow, unreal. Yes, it's complex, but overtly and overly so. The only way the storylines meet is all the protagonists end up in an elevator towards the end - a sad attempt to bring together the stories.Pathetic."
4,"Good story, 1950's British social sensibility","Graham has written a few of these stories about the psychologically troubled woman who gets herself into deep trouble. The stories are good, and Marnie in particular (with major revisions) made a good film. It's hard to tell if it was just the times in which he wrote these stories, but the women all seem initially reasonably strong emotionally but make very bad choices proving themselves to be weak minded but can't seem to help it. Maybe its a quirk with the writer, he likes sad, screwed-up women. Looking at it from the perspective of 50+ years later, these poor ladies are a bit hard to swallow."
3,so so,"It's an o.k. book, but I would have preferred to see more info. with the animators. A book like ""Aladdin: The making of an animated film"" has two to three times as much info. on the animators and their approach than this book has and this book is twice as long. To my knowledge, there wasn't even a mention that the character design of Jane was based on the ""Gibson girl"". This is just an example of the lack of exposure given to the actual artistic work done. This book mostly chronicles the tumultuous story process that it took to create this movie. It goes into far too much detail about this. Also spends too much time discussing Phil Collins, the voice actors, and the research in Africa. I wanted to hear a lot more from Glen Keane, Ken Duncan and the rest of the animators."
4,Worth it,"This was my first purchase from Amazon and I think it's a very good accompaniment to the movie. Alright, it still has tendencies like all the Disney Art books of reading like a big press release, which is kind of insulting to those of us who are serious animation connoisseurs. Even the 'diary extracts' of Keane, Lima and Collins seem kind of fake. Like others, I would have liked to have seen less talk about the music and more about the art. But the sheer abundance of production art and sketches are well worth getting it."
2,"Rose-flavored Water, NOT Rosewater","If all you're after is rose flavor for cooking, then this is fine-- but if you want real rosewater, which is distilled from roses, you need to buy somewhere else. It is not made at all clear that this is not real rosewater."
2,Tastes LIke Perfume,"Yes, they should say artificial rose water flavor. I thougt it was natural where it says rose flavor. Flavor usually means artificial unless it says natural flavor though. This flavor is probably distilled from petroleum. Maybe I'll use it to scent handkerchiefs or something.I just assumed that after paying $4 for one bottle and it being from an ethnic store, maybe they wouldn't know about making it with artificial flavor. I must tell you, after one sip, I can't stand any more.It says no preservatives, so it gives you that natural vibe impression. I guess if it had real rosewater, it would have preservatives. I feel like I have been tequiyaed.If you drink this stuff you may end up hating the whole idea of rose water for life."
1,"oh god, my mouth",I assumed this was a drink? It has nutrition facts on it.. what a horrible taste. I managed one sip.
2,depressing (spoilers),"This is well written and the characters are believable, as are all Balogh's books.But it is pretty depressing. A lot of it is about rape. So forget the idea that this is light, entertaining reading. Also, we never learn whether the heroine's idea that she is unable to have children is true. Ditto the secondary female character.The ending is also drawn out unnecessarily for no apparent reason. It can't be that the author had a word quota to fill.Like most kindle books, there are OCR errors. It doesn't even look like they ran it through a spelling corrector. At $7.99 a copy, they could have done that.Knowing what I know now, I would not have bought the book."
1,Too predictable,Spare me. This one was just too predictable. I could have told you what was going to happen from the first page.
4,Mary Balogh knows how to touch your heart.,"Like all of Balogh's books, this one takes the traditional Regency romance and gives it an original twist. She allows you to feel the heroes pain as he struggles between following his heart and doing what society regards as right and honorable. Although this book does not quite reach the heartbreaking heights of many of her other novels, it is well worth reading."
3,"Good, but......","I admit to being a little schizophrenic about this book. Over all, I think I liked it---I certainly didn't hate it. However, I had a real tough time with what happened to Lily when she was a captive. It was very, very ugly, and Lily seemed to recover so very, very easily that I found it totally unbelievable. What happened to Lily was akin to what happened to Jamie in ""Outlander"" and that one scene in ""Outlander"" almost ruined the book for me, and what happened to Lily never left my mind at any point in this book. It was simply too dark to be glossed over. Nonetheless, the book was interesting enough and well written enough to keep my interest, although I will never, ever re-read it."
5,One Night for Love,Like all Mary Balogh's books this one is a page turner. I can't wait for her newest one to be available because I will buy it and read it immediately.Super author!
5,Wonderful Regency Romance,"This book is one of her best. An elderly friend of mine who had a recent stay in hospital asked me to bring some quality romance books for her to read. I just put ""One Night for Love"", ""Indiscrete"", ""Irresistible"", ""Christmas Beau"" and several other Mary Balogh romances into a bag and took them in. You should have seen the look on her face as I emptied my Baloghs onto the bedside table. Whoever said that romance was dead?"
4,Good Read,"I liked the book though a bit too descriptive. I would like to see a follow-up with Lauren, I found her to be the more likeable character. Hopefully this author will be writing it in the near future, I will keep a check on her book listings. Lauren was a complicated character who was extremely suppressed emotionally and the book, if written, would be a good one."
4,A Historical Setting with Contemporary Dialogues,"Balogh has a gift to mingle 20th century concepts to a regency background. e.g. of girls to be of equals to their mate, of the rich but sensible Elizabeth to remain single and wait for Mr. Right because of her economically independence, and of the role Elizabeth, who gave Lily a my-fair-lady type makeover, which is parallel to the effect of a modern day councellor in a borading school... The dailogue of Balogh is also free of the periods jargan like that of Austen and Heyer that makes them more 'reader-friendly' to todays audience. This gives a much enjoyable experience similar to the 'time travel' genre that I adore -- having heroines with strong and independent charachter changing the minds of traditional and conservative people."
1,It wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.,"I am a big Mary Balogh fan and I loved her other books. But this one was very dissappointing. I was more than a little surprised that her other books were so good that I couldn't put them down, and this one just seems to be dragging along."
3,Very very disappointing - BORING,"I have read almost all of Mary Balogh's books, and this is probably the first one that I had to partly skim because I was BORED ! It started out quite good, with the disruption of the Earl's wedding by the appearance of his 'dead' wife, but the story went downhill from there. Perhaps the main problem is that I couldn't work up any interest in the heroine; I didn't really care what happened to her, so I had no great desire to keep reading. Mary Balogh could have done so much better with her premise."
1,Disappointed,I orderd this book because it has good ratings but i am so disappointed.The best word to discribe it is BORING.I had the feeling the author didn't have so many ideas for her story so she filled the book up with endless scene discribtion and monologes.Sometimes I could scip a page or two and I didn't really miss anything.I didn't read the book to the end (read about three quaters). I didn't like that the main characters loved each other from the beginning so there was no tension at all for me.I prefer if the characters argue and fight and then realise they love each other (but thats my opinion) That defenitly didn't happen in that book!steph(sorry for spelling and grammar mistakes I am german)
4,Melodic and soothing,"If anyone is looking for a soundtrack which is subtle yet inspiring, Diablo 2 offers it. Some of the greatest pieces of writing I have ever written have come while listening to this soundtrack. The music almost takes you out of this realm mentally and spiritually. It is very relaxing and engaging. I've thought about having this music played continually throughout my house over a home theatre speaker system if I ever get time to install it."
5,Are you confident enough to read this book??,This book can be compared to any of Massad Ayoob's Books.The information regarding defending your life and propertyshould be required reading prior to a self-defense firearmpurchase. Males should swallow their macho ego andread from this tome
5,a must read if you are considering a handgun,"Thoughtful, informative and written in simple language for the woman who has, or is intending to own/carry a concealed weapon.Covers types of handguns, true life experiences, other means of self defense and consequences of using lethal force."
3,Makes you think,"Interesting book really makes you think about self defense in todays world. I grew up with guns, hunting and target shooting so I might have a different perspective than most. Having a loaded gun readily accessable is a huge responsibility that can either save your life or ruin it forever."
1,Avoid being a complete idiot,"This is the first _Idiot's Guide_ I've ever bought, and if others are like this one it will be my last.It's hard to figure out what exactly this book was designed to do. It gives almost no helpful information in the actual preparation of a network, but instead focuses (inasmuch as it ever does come to a point) on the nature of networks. Maybe this is good stuff for those facing a written exam in a theoretical course in college, but for those of us in the real world, there's simply not much here. Don't expect that this book will actually help you set up a network.Apparently this a ""Complete Idiot's Guide"" not because it explains how to set up a network in simple terms, but because you feel like a complete idiot after buying it."
2,not so good,"I have just finished reading this book.Ok - I did get some new information, but i am ultimately disappointed.Please only get it, if you are a complete beginner. I thought that i was a complete network newbie, but I knew most of the information already...."
5,Amazing. Five Thumbs Up.,"This is one of the greatest new bands ever. A Static Lullaby just breeds greatness (Faso doesn't count, you know this). This time they breeded something greater than itself. Don't think it's similar, though. This is extremely experimental and very far from ""scene"" or screamo.Summary: You need to own this. I mean, I do."
2,False Advertising,"I looked specifically for Thinsulate brand gloves and thought I was ordering Thinsulate brand gloves. When they arrived, they were clearly NOT Thinsulate brand gloves.The velcro patches almost completely came off after the first usage and had to be sewn back on. Additionally, the inner lining started to come lose on one of them after only a few wears.Do not buy this product thinking you're getting Thinsulate gloves. They AIN'T."
4,Spike Jones-Music's Clown Prince,"Musicologist Barry Hansen,better known as radio personality Dr.Demento,has said that Spike Jones was the first novelty artist he remembers hearing as a child-This disc features all the big hits that Spike & his City Slickers had in the 1940's:""Cocktails For Two"",""William Tell Overture"",""Laura"",""Dance Of The Hours""-I'll bet Weird Al Yankovic would cite Spike as one of his influences-Anyway,if you love silly music,this one's right up your alley."
5,You always hurt (*CRACK-BOOM* EGAH!) the one you love,"Who else could gargle his way through the William Tell Overture, I ask you, than Spike Jones? This CD was first my grandmother's, then my mother's and now it's mine, and let me tell you, I am very proud to be in this hereditary line of musical insanity (strange as its existance is)! This is amazing stuff-HILARIOUS, innovative, imaginative (to say the least!), and gloriously over-the-top. I promise you, dear readers, my child will be humming Dance of the Hours before they know how to read, car-horns and all!"
4,Great nostalgia,My Dad shared this one with me and now I am enjoying sharing it with my son. A wonderfully esoteric piece of music history.
5,What a Gem,if you are a Spike Jones fan you will love this..I purchased this as a gift and my husband was so happy to receive it.If you know someone that likes Spike Jones this would be a great place to start shopping.
1,Be warned of audio quality,"I bought this disc because I wanted the music in my library but I returned it because of the audio quality. Like masters of vintage music made in the '50's & '60's, there is echo effect. While many won't care, die hard collectors might find this annoying. Be warned."
1,Total Waste of Time,"What can be said except that Vornholt has no idea how to write Babylon 5. The plot is flawed, the settings will be unfamiliar and unrecognizable to B5 fans, and the characterizations are dead wrong. Skip it."
1,"Worst book, Worst professor, April cannot let go of his pride","For those columbia students who are buying this for their anatomy course, a warning. This book is outdated. the pictures are in black and white, and there are only a handful of them. you must study with a netters. Ernest April is a penny pinching egomaniac who won't let go of the fact that he published a book...really more of an outline, about 40 years ago. This book is out of print. for a reason. There are innumerous errors throughout the book. MAJOR ERRORS. he calls them ""errata"". He sells his CD -which is this book in a hard to use CD format, where you can only see one section at a time, for 20$. If you have an older version of the CD -also littered w/ errata, he will sell you a new CD for 10$. He is THE worst lecturer, and this is THE worst way to learn anatomy if you have had no prior experience (which most students have not had). I can only hope that he will no longer be teaching next year."
2,Good Overall but contains many errors,This is book is fair overall but contains multiple errors. It is good as a supplementary text but I would not base my studying for the USMLE boards on it.
1,Agreed,"Now I know what Junior Wells would have sounded like from a bathroom stall. You can't even understand a word he's saying. Do not buy this album, ever."
1,AVOID AT ALL COST,"Poor Junior is rolling over in his grave at the thought of this piece of dreck being fostered on the unsuspecting buying public. Horrible recording quality and spotty performances. I listened to this after it was given to me by a friend (with fair warning that it's really bad).... I should have listened. If I could give this a negative rating I would. Apologies to Cub Koda and his much more generous review. This performance was by any measure sub par, the horrible recording quality, mislabeled tracks, and general lack of accurate information makes this one of those items you wish you had never found. SERIOUSLY, AVOID AT ALL COST. There is a reason it sells new for 1.99 USD. Awful!!!"
4,ok,donot buy this book if you are taking the elementary german course and if they follow 6th edition. The 5th edition is a lot more different than the 6th. I'd to buy the 6th edition again.
1,Light fixture broke,The lamp looks good but the light fixture broke after about a week. I have to plug the lamp in and out the wall to get it to turn on.
4,Nice lamp,After you understand the assembly process it's pretty easy to put together. We bought two. The first took about a half hour the second only about ten minutes. Nice thing is you can leave out one section if it's too tall for where you want it. Only thing we wish they had done is use a black cord instead of the gold colored one that runs down from the top. It really stands out. We might wrap it with black electrical tape to make it blend better
4,Happy With It,Particle board but it is the more solid type of board. The lamp is very nice looking and easy as cake to assemble. It doubling as a shelf is a nice bonus for the house. May buy another one.
3,Good lamp expensive shipping,"If you buy from Target beware! They charge A LOT for shipping. Almost half the price of the lamp itself. I was annoyed after I found this out after the lamp was shipped.My own fault i guess but still, watch out!But as far as the lamp goes, it's good. It was straight forward to assemble and it looks great. I wish they would have provided some sort of way to hide the chord like some sort of hook along the edge of one of the beams to keep the chord neatly out of the way, otherwise it just sort of dangles there which doesn't look as great."
3,Nice appearance but flimsy,"Bought two lamp shades and placed them on either side of my bed. They look nice, but if I brush up against them, they wobble quite a bit. I suppose it is to be expected that if you have something tall and narrow, it will be unsteady, but I wished they had placed more weight on the base. I may actually nail them onto larger wooden bases for stability, but they do get the job done. Also, they are elegant in appearance and add a sophisticated accent to my bedroom for relatively low cost."
4,Easy Build & Looks Great,Everything about this lamp works great - for the price. The install itself was very easy and I was able to build the entire thing in ~10 minutes. It looks great.
3,Get It For Yngwie,"Overall this album is very average leaning towards weak. The saving grace is hearing a relatively young Yngwie Malmsteen. The songs themselves just occupy time until Yngwie's solos save the day. The exception is ""Hiroshima Mon Amour,"" which deserves recognition as a metal classic! Stirring, soul touching and powerful both musically and lyrically, this song makes the album! ""Hiroshima..."" also contains a truly memorable Malmsteen solo!After the first half of the album Yngwie is replaced by Steve Vai--and later by another musician--on lead guitar, and the music becomes rather forgettable. However, I still recommend buying the album just to experience the musical mastery of Yngwie Malmsteen."
4,Gasdynamics Book,"Gasdynamics is a difficult topic to read. the book does not explain detail, hence you must have a lot of previous knowledge"
5,Excellent Digital Camera,"Can't begin to describe this 'little gem'! The size, compact and perfect for carrying around all the time. Ready for anything. Photos are crisp, details are great. The battery is holding it's own. Only owning it short time, haven't experienced all specifications thus far; confident that my shopping paid off. No regrets thus far."
1,"Doctor, heal thyself.","Being a doctor myself, I bought this book with great anticipation. I expected to glean some insight into the medical profession that I had not come across as of yet. However, what I found was the memoirs of a very insecure person. I don't want readers to come away from this book assuming that all doctors have gone through 4 divorces and have been addicted to drugs. I found this book to be full of cliches and poor poetry. I got so tired of it all that I stopped reading halfway. If you do buy this book, please remember not to generalize about the rest of us."
3,Dr. Farber's Psychotherapy,"A worthy effort for a non-writer. More of a work of catharsis than anything else. There is a lot of repetition in this book; some sentences are repeated verbatim a few paragraphs later. The poems are atrocious. As a fellow physician and Baylor grad, I applaud the fact that he has overcome some tremendous obstacles in his life (albeit many self-inflicted). His patients are lucky to have him. I wish him well."

4,great for repair molds,"I used it as putty for repair metal molds which have about 230cels thermoplastic rubber. This J-B Weld endured the heat shock so kept its form very well. But avoid to apply this to a part of slender rod or like something finespun, under 5mm thick. Easy to break if you bend by hand. Mind that J-B Weld contains steel powder but weaker than steel, it is just a resin."
4,Works well,"This stuff is not too stinky so you don't have to use it outside. It bonds very well to anything I have tried it with and sets up quickly, but not too quickly. One thing I used it for was cementing the dryer exhaust vent to the house. Just be sure to mix it up with something disposable -- I use a paper plate and a popsicle stick. It will dry to a gray color, so don't use it on something that needs to be clear."
3,Missing Too Many Songs,"I'm a fan of Rene & Angela (""My First Love"" is one of my favorites songs), and I own this cd.I think this is a poor compilation of their ""greatest hits"".It's missing, for instance:* You Don't Have to Cry* I'll Be Good* Your Smile* Save Your Love (For Number 1)* Do You Really Love Me?* Strangers AgainThose songs should be on a compilation of Rene & Angela's greatest hits, but they aren't on this disk.There are plenty of other songs on here that I could have done without.I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this disk, I'm just pointing out what's missing that, in my opinion, should have been on here."
5,Spike at his Best - Reverb at its Worst!,"Frankly, I didn't know how many stars to give this. I gave it 5 because it's a wonderful compilation -- ALL of Spike's classical music. (""Nutcracker Suite"" is edited down, deleting most of the choir passages -- which are hard to understand anyway.) BUT: the 1971 re-mastering added heavy electronic echo, phase shift and filtering to simulate stereo. This CD actually mixes the end result back to mono again! -- with painful results!"
5,A must have for the Spike Collection,"I have had the vinyl record of this since the early 70's (still play it). Now my kids are loving it, so I need to acquire in CD as my vinyl is a bit scratched. Spike Jones humor is timeless. Pal-Yat-Chee is one of the best tracks on the album."
5,matisse his art and his textiles,I thought it was a lovely book full of lovely pictures i had not seen before it gives u a real insight into this mans colourful life
3,Flawed but Enjoyable,"I was quite excited back in September or October when I found out that Enya was finally putting out a new album. Now I wish she had taken a little more time in the studio to write more songs. The first problem I have with this cd is that it is too short. I was stunned to find out that it clocked in less than 40 minutes. No one should have to pay full price for a cd that is less than 40 minutes. I personally feel ripped off. My other problem with this cd is that some of her songs sounds like her other songs. I felt like at times that I was listening to ""Watermark"" part two. Her songs aren't completely terrible but I wouldn't call them original either. I enjoy listening to this cd on a cold winter day or when I go to bed."
2,Sounds exactly like the last four albums,I really liked her first two albums. I also liked her in Clannad. But now her sound is becoming a blur. I guess she has found her audience and hasn't bored them to death yet. Enya seems to still sell albums.
4,a relaxing CD,"although i'm not familiar with all of Enya's music, i've worn out my copy of ""paint the sky with stars."" i like to use her music for relaxing, studying, bubble baths, etc. when i found out she had a new album, i decided to give it a try. i liked it very much! i've been using it to study for exams this semester. the songs are a good variety of light and fluffy to dark and brooding. i think any seasoned Enya fan will be pleased. my favorite songs are ""wild child"" and ""one by one."""
3,The great and the terrible,"OK...long time Enya fan here...going on 13 years. I have and always will love her music and voice. A Day Without Rain is classic, lovely, wonderfull music...especially Wild Child. The only problem with the album is that it is only 34 minutes long. Surely Enya, Roma and Nicky can come up with more than 34 minutes of music over the last 5 years. I felt cheated for paying $17 for an album that barely lasts longer than a South Park episode. That is not to say I would not have bought the album had I known, I would have, but I would have bought it through Amazon.Com and saved $3!"
5,The peace ful garden of dreams that help me to sleep in peac,"I have been listening to Enya for quite some time now. I turned others onto her wave of flowing peace, relaxation and a wholeness of beauty she puts in her lyrics and music. Great to sleep to and definately meditate to if others are not disturbing me. Her music is hauntingly mysterious, lulling and serene to where you would just feel at peace and believe you're in another world that the music takes you there."
2,Disappointing,"I have to say that I'm disappointed with this CD and I'm generally a fan of hers. The music is nice but it doesn't seem new (same style, same sound) and hardly seems worth the wait. It is also a somewhat short album to be sure. I'd say if you really like Enya and would like to hear more of her this is worthwhile, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it. Maybe wait for it to go on sale. Otherwise it's not much more than nice background music for me. I'm sure she can do better."
4,Great introduction to Enya,"I had heard the popular ""Only Time"" on the radio, and loved it, so I purchased this CD basically for that one song. I was pleasantly surprised there are several other beautiful songs on this CD. If you're new to Enya, this is the one to get. My only complaint is that her songs are all very similar in rhythm, tone and feel. These are also not songs that most will learn the lyrics to, but they are beautiful and relaxing. Perfect for unwinding after work with some candles and incense burning."
3,Why so short?,"The music is what you'd expect on an Enya release -- nothing earth-shattering, but remarkably pleasant and soothing. My only complaint (as others have voiced) is the brevity of the CD itself. Surely, Enya could have included the two songs that were on the European release of ""A Day Without Rain"" that were inexplicably cut for the US release -- making this CD clock in at just around 35 minutes.After a 6-year absence, you'd think Enya could at least provide us with an hour of new music."
5,"angel, where art thou?","music just doesn't get any better than this album. The instrumentals and the sweet angelic voice of Enya is all one could hope for. If you don""t have it yet, what are you waiting for?"
5,Another Great one,"I will admit i was never a big fan of new age music, then i heard Enya and have been buying her music for years.""A day without rain has to be her best yet.I get home from work and put it in, have a glass of wine, and there is nothing more relaxing and stress relieving.Enya's style of music and instumental sounds put you in another world and lifts your spirits to another level. I would highly recommend this cd to the new age fans."
3,Only if the Lyrics Were Printed in a Bigger Size,I would give this album a higher rating if the lyrics were printed in a larger size.
2,Enya'wn',"After thoroughly enjoying her previous releases, I found this cd a little tiring and not as imaginative. Obviously, a cd you like you keep nearby and at-hand. Unfortunately, this cd has been banished to that big tall cd tower in my living room after less than a dozen listens."
2,Made a mistake,Thought I might find out what the fuss is about. Pure vapor. It's the type of record that you put on in the background to soundtrack every day activity since most Americans can't handle silence any longer. Then if you try to listen it's so slight that it dissapears. Absolutely no substance - just wallpaper.
2,Very Disappointing!,"I love Enya's music, but it seems she has every cd with the same formation. Every cd has an instrumental, every cd starts with her ethereal voices and every cd has one song in Gaelic. It's as if you know what she'll do on every cd, it lacks real surprises. She needs to loosen up a little bit and add some new stuff. It's okay when its 2 or 3 cd's, does it have to be on every one of them. Enya seek more influences!"
2,"O.K., I guess","At the behest of a female friend, who is a foam at the mouth Enya fan, I borrowed this CD and listened to it several times. The music is passably well composed, and skillfully executed, but lacks any variation of device, or technique through the course of the album. Frankly, I found the album non-memorable, as I can now, a month after hearing it, remember but a few themes, and no melodies.In a hundred years people will be listening to:(a)Brahms, (b) Mahler, (c) Wagner, (d) Enya. Pick three.I would only recommend this album to the Terminally Weepy, girls under 15, and the Imaginatively Challanged."
3,"mellow, but not their best",I'm a big Enya fan but I was a little disappointed by this album. There are a few songs on here that I heard and then had to have the CD... but I found that those songs were the only ones that I really liked. It's nice and mellow but not their best in my opinion.
4,Crazy amazing day!,"Enya is back and better than ever. Her music still has the ability to touch you inner emotions, and sets your spirit singing. There is not one mediocre song on the entire CD. I feel the best songs to be One by One, Flora's Secret & Lazy Days, with it's very uplifting tempo. Enya still intertwines instrumental pieces throughout her works, which are great intermissions between her vocal pieces. Once again Enya adds her very powerful and dramatic feelings to her non english songs, such as the Latin Tempus Vernum, which carries the theme of the seasons. The only flaw and the reason that I am rating A Day Without Rain with 4 stars is due to the album being to short. Just as you are ready for more it's over. The CD definitely could have used another 1 or 2 songs like the Japanese version which includes Isobella. Enya thank you for providing sophisticated and elegant music."
4,Only time will Tell,"The return of enya is welcome as a day wthout rain (in Ireland, not in the dessert !) It seems she has embraced the qualities of brevity in all her songs. In short, they are all hopelessly too short. Having 5 long years to construct the album (that's how the album feels : constructed), you'd think they'd have made the songs clock in at 4 minutes at least. Anyway, enya seems to be writing the new-age 3-minute pop song. tte"
4,classic - as can be expected,"another well-made CD from one of the most familar names in New Age. The first three tracks in this CD offers a good glimpse of the creative talent in Enya. well composed, well rendered, and well written. The fourth track is more hanuting than the others and is a nice change of tempo. The other tracks are vintage-Enya. nothing extra, nothing new..but the usual slow tempo any Enya fan will expect. Overall, a nice collection of tracks..Not much new ground is broken in this CD..but the first four tracks in itself makes it worthwhile to purchase the CD."
4,A Day Without Rain,"Having been in Ireland and seen Enya's house (which is for sale), it was good to get this CD as I have about 4 others of hers and do enjoy the lyrics and music."
4,Pretty...,"This album is a different step for Enya. Instead of the gentle drone of the synthesizer, you get what sounds like an entire orchestra (but is purely electronic). The lyrics aren't bad either, and R. Ryan still has the touch at this point. As a result, the entire album has a very lush, rich sound with the theme of nature. Not one of her best, but it is a very pretty one. I wish it was longer, though."
2,Pop goes Enya,"For all her mystical etherial talent, this recorcing is all-American pop at its poorest...Cliche lyrics, choppy tempos, flat artistry. Perhaps she finds it novel to sing in english, but this cd is nothing like her earlier beautiful work... If you're an original Enya fan, this isnt it."
5,More beautiful with each album.,"Enya is leaving the heavier, darker sounds behind more and more as with this album only Tempus Vernum has the ominous Gothic sound to it. The rest of the tracks leave you spellbound with either her signature moving piano pieces or absolutely beautiful vocals. A Day Without Rain opens the album in much the same mood as Watermark did, but then the title track and Wild Child bring such a lovely, hopeful tone that it is hard not to be enchanted with the disc by those two songs alone. After a break with two songs reminiscent of her older sound, Enya continues with more music that lets you simply relax and daydream. Simply beautiful and without a doubt necessary for anyone that likes any Enya song."
5,Short but OH SO SWEET!!,"Clocking in at just under 40 minutes, it took me awhile to be able to rank this high amongst the rest of the Enya classics. Now I'm in love with it, and would even go as far as to say it is her best. Unlike other outings like, say, Sheperd Moons (which I also love but find a tad too long), every second on this masterpiece is pure magic and a delight to the ears. There are NO wasted, idle or less-beautiful moments here. I think ""Lazy Days"" is one of the best closing tracks of any I've ever heard. It leaves you in ecstasy, wanting more, but there is no more....which is exactly the feeling a monumental recording should give you....Can't wait for the next recording, even if it is in 5 years...."
2,The Song Remains the Same...,"I'll keep this brief. While Enya's sound is certainly melodic, lush and layered - the 35 minutes on this CD seemed like an eternity to me of the same song playing over and over. I couldn't wait for it to end. I would stick to her earlier work with Clannad instead of this example of homogeneous, blended muzak."
3,Nice and...short,"I can only repeat what others have said here. It's a nice CD, but itis shockingly short. Especially after such a long hiatus betweenreleases. People said Sting was pretentious for releasing a 2-CD,""Nothing Like the Sun."" However, Mr. Sting (?) at least gaveus our money's worth. At the end of the LP age, Sting released enoughmaterial to fill a CD, even if it meant the LP version would extendpast the medium's capacity. Now we have Enya releasing a recordingonly 34 minutes long, on a medium that can hold more than twice that.I'd call that a bit pretentious. And not very respectful of herlegions of fans.And what is the deal with the Latin chantingstuff? I never have understood that.She could also do a littleless of the pizzicato-sounding keyboard. Gets tiresome.Butotherwise, I'm glad I bought it..."
2,This CD is uninspiring at best.,"This CD was a major disappointment - nothing new or memorable. Enya's voice is as clear as always, but the music here is a third rate repetition of other CDs that she has made."
5,Beautiful Music,"I had never heard of Enya before I first heard ""Only Time"" play in the theatre as I waited for the movie to start. I'd never heard that before, and it was such lovely music. It reminded me of ""Orinico Flow"" (I didn't know that it was called Orinico Flow at the time), or at least the instruments sounded like it. After the song was done playing, I heard them say it was ""Only Time"" from the CD ""A Day Without Rain"" by Enya. After that I immediately bought the CD, and listened to the other great songs! This is the first CD of Enya I've ever bought and actually heard, and now it's making me buy more of Enya's work. I really love this CD, the music is so peaceful and calming, and it shows how nice a voice Enya has and her and the Ryans' talent with creating this music. I recommend getting this CD if you are just getting into Celtic music, or if you are curious about Enya's music, because I'm sure you'll be pleased with it. =)"
4,Remarkable.......but..........,"Yes, it IS wonderful. It's the next step in Enya's evolution, which continues to point towards the heavens. And I never get tired of listening to ALL of her music. And I hesitate to say anything negative since the CD is so brilliant, but I must. This is one of the shortest albums/CDs I can remember. It's not just ""a little on the short side"" as a previous reviewer suggested, IT'S A LOT SHORT. It would be short by vinyl standards. It seems that the high cost of CDs today, along with their longer playing times, might give an artist cause to bring forth a work that was a bit longer than 34 minutes and 20 seconds. Yes, I suppose that means I'll hear the songs it yields more often, since there aren't so many of them, but next time I'd like a little more meat. Very pretty, though.....what there is of it."
4,Pretty Good CD,"This was the first enya cassette I brought. When I heard only time I knew I had to buy it, but I wanted to see if they were any other songs I liked from her previous albums and I was surprise that she did songs that I haven't heard in years, You know you might hear a song and you love it but you don't know who performed it. So I bought every album except the Celts which I'm planning to buy soon. My favorite tracks on this album are lazy days because I can relate :-) A day without rain, Fallen Embers, Flora's Secret and Deora Ar Mo Chroi. I did think it was short but I liked it very much, something new. I would agree with some of the reviews it's relaxing something to listen to on a sunny or rainy day just lying on your bed watching time flow by."
3,Short and Sweet,"As usual, Enya has put out some very good songs on this album. However, from start to finish, the album is only about half an hour long. I don't know about anyone else, but I felt vaguely cheated by this. In other words, if you like Enya, you'll like this cd, but put your cd player on repeat 'cause it's way too short."
5,Great,This is such a great CD. I barrowed it from our local library and i'm going to buy it as soon as possible. It's really great and you will love it!
3,More of the same,"I very much enjoy Enya's work, but, once again, her voice seems smothered by the music. The lyrics are often difficult to hear, and the pieces, althought good, have a certain ""sameness"". I just don't think Enya's voice has the power to stand on its own, as Loreena McKennitt or Mary Jane Lamond can."
5,A Day without Rain,I love Ency it is an other CD Alum that harm me down also and the music is wonderful to hear.
2,Earlier Songs Recycled,"I am a huge Enya fan, but this new release sounds to me like a basic re-working of her previous melodies. Before I listen to it a hundred times and it sinks in, this is my first impression. Not that Enya needs to change anything, but there just isn't anything fundamentally new here. Her three previous releases, on the other hand, were very exploratory each in themselves. But this new one sounds like a re-hash of ""In Memory of Trees"". Enya is now in a rut, but at least it is a pleasant one. The last song ""Lazy Days"" almost redeems the CD, but not quite."
2,Disappointing,"It seems like Enya has repeated her formula one too many times - every song on this album sounds an awful lot like things she's already done in the recent past. The worst part is that it leans so heavily on the ""pop"" sounding tunes that seem designed to be radio-friendly, and all but abandons the mystical, other-worldly style that made ""Watermark"" and ""Shepherd Moons"" so great. Maybe it's time for her to dump her long-time collaborators and finally move in a new direction; she's capable of so much more than this."
1,Longtime Enya Fan Disappointed,"First of all there's only 11 short tracks on this CD that only amount to 35 minutes, which is ridiculous considering it's her first work in 5 years. And a few of the songs barely even feature her voice on them. If you are new to Enya and want to try her out, don't bother with this crock, and pick up the far superior ""Watermark"" instead. Enya's definitely dragging her feet with this uninspired dreck. I kept thinking I had already heard these songs before the whole time I was listening to it. That incomprehensible angellic warbling gets old pretty quick. Take the track ""Wild Child"", for example. It has that same ethereal music, and some mumbly words you can make out, then the last words are the songs title. Why it's even titled that is a mystery to me, she should have called it ""Prozac Child."""
2,Couldn't Be A Flatter Platter,"Enya has explored new territory on each of her successive recordings. Likewise, each recording has borne the unmistakable hallmark of passion and power. This CD lacks both. Enya was never boring until this release, and it's not because we want someting radically new. She simply has failed to preserve her inner-delight on this CD, and believe me...human beings can tell when music is forced, or when an artist is boring themselves. Enya basically recycles all of her old tricks without bothering to recycle her conviction. I sensed the lack of verve in this CD after only a couple of songs. Her only triumph on this work is the 'Flora' song. This one piece leaves us with at least a thread of hope that she is not burned out entirely by her own mystique."
2,Disappointingly simple and unchallenging,"All of Enya's previous albums have been great works of amazingly complexity, unusual harmonies, and strikingly beautiful melodies.Her previous album ""The Memory of Trees"" features breathtakingly innovative sounds and compositions of significant depth and innovation (such as ""Pax Deorum"").Unfortunately, this new album has virtually none of this. She takes some of her previous melodies and recycles them into simple, repetitive pop songs. From the other reviews, it is clear that there are many fans of her vocal style and beautiful melodies. These fans seem oblivious to what greater elements are missing from her latest effort."
3,Beware if you want to rip this CD for use on an MP3 player,"I'm a great fan of Enya and have many of her albums. I bought this CD to rip onto my iPod for use in my car along with the other Enya albums that I have. It won't rip - clearly, it's got some kind of copy protection. It works on my CD player but not on my laptop."
5,The Magician of the Irish Princess,"This CD contais the marvelous Only Time, which was one of the soundtracks of ""Sweet November"". It's gorgeous.Enya continues being my favourist singer of all time. Her voice is amazing and in each of her CDs you have something very special.Wild Child is a piece that tell us how to take advantage of every single moment of all our lives. Again the singer and composer tell us to seize the day.In Only Time we found roads that leads to love. The song is perfect for the film.It is dificult to elicit the best song, because all of them has a peculiar charateristic.The CD is wraped up with ""Lazy Days"", contrasting, in my opinion, hardworking days with the relaxing ones"".You listen to Enya once and then you'll be completely adicted to her gorgeous voice. You just get very anxious to get her next CD."
5,Love this CD,"I own one or two other Enya releases. She definitely creates a mood with this one. I've not heard much press on this, but would certainly recommend it as a good selection if you are inclined to like Enya, The Clannad or other such group."
5,GO ENYA,"I USE ALL ENYA MUSIC FOR MY HOLISTIC PRACTICE, ALWAYS HAPPY TO HEAR HER TUNES. VERY PLEASANT, UNBELIEVABLY ABLE TO EXPOSE OUR MOST DEEPEST EMOTIONS."
3,Great Music -- Not Enough of It,"As someone who's been waiting a long time for Enya to produce another album firmly in the same league as ""Watermark"", I'm happy to say this is; it's the first album of hers I've bought since ""Watermark"", and it's also one of the few new CD's I'll buy this year. The music is really fine from end to end.My gripe is that the running time is less than 35 minutes. Every track is a suitable-for-any-airplay-format 3:35 (a few are shorter). In an era when many, if not most, CD's run 60-70 minutes, I feel they should have labeled this an extended EP or included a coupon for the other half of it when that was released. Being the length of an 80's vinyl album just makes it way too short for the price.So, 4 1/2 - 5 stars for quality, 1 star for quantity."
2,"Should have been titled ""Running Out of Steam"".","The first thing I noticed about this CD was that no track times are listed with the track titles, not that unusual I'll admit, but then when I put the disc in my player total play time is less than 35 minutes! Not much value for the high end price tag, especially when discs with play times of 60 and 70 minutes can be found in the $10 to $12 range. But my major disappointment came with listening to this over produced and formulaic collection of tunes. Now don't get me wrong, I have been an Enya fan ever since hearing her lush, multi-layered vocals while watching ""The Celts"" on PBS many years ago, and I own every CD and music video that she has released. But, in my opinion the only tracks of any merit on this disc are ""tempus vernum"" and ""deora ar mo chroi"", sung in latin and gaelic respectively. I expect to start seeing this title in the ""previously owned"" bins right away, and if you absolutely must have it in your collection, wait to buy it from there."
2,It Doesn't Overwhelm & Awe You - Like Enya's Music Should,"First, if this were any artist but Enya, this CD would have gotten 4 stars. But I expect more from Enya. I expect to be overwhelmed and awed and inspired by her music. Almost everything she's created in the past has done that to me at some level, usually on the first or second listen. Unfortunately, ""A Day Without Rain"", after 4 or 5 plays, just doesn't have that same power.The track ""Tempus Vernum"" is easily the best, and really the only memorable, song on the CD. The rest is mostly in English, and much of it almost sounds more like pop than like Enya.It's been a long wait, and it's unfortunately a big disappointment. I hope that it's not another five years before we see more from Enya, and I hope that the next release brings back the magic that only Enya's music can bring."
4,Enya likes us Canadians,"Well apparently Enya decided to give us Canadians (and a few other countries besides the US) one extra track on our cut of ADWR. How nice of her. If any of you in America live near the border I'd recommend taking one afternoon to just drive up here and pick up the 12 track copy if you're that much of a die hard fan, otherwise you're not missing much. I like the extra track ""The First of Autumn"" though, it's nice. Still I can't give this album a perfect score because it should have been a little bit longer. My question is: Why didn't she put ALL of the new tracks she made onto her album? She could have added ""The Promise"", ""Isobella"" and ""The First of Autumn"" to make a total of 14 tracks. That would have been more respectable. I love the album though."
2,More of the same,"This album would get 3 stars on its own, but it gets 2 for a few reasons. It doesn't really seem to go anywhere for one. Don't get me wrong, I love Enya's music, but sometimes I wish she would make an album that wasn't ""Watermark...part whatever."" The songs are well crafted and beautifully sung, but they all sound like they could belong on any of her previous albums. If you like Enya and don't want her to change or evolve, then you'll love this album, but if you want to see a new direction or more influences, you might be disappointed."
4,Originally breathtaking...,"Enya's work has always left me feeling intrigued and wanting more. This album ends a long waiting period, within which I satisfy my hunger by listening to different varieties of celtic music. When I bought it, I did not have any expectation other than the believe I will enjoy it as I have enjoyed Memory of Trees, the Celts, Shepherd Moon, Watermark and her compilation. Although Enya has not ventured too far away from her concept, she still emphasizes originality in her work, which is something I respect in an artist. My favorite of this album are Flora's Secret, Pilgrim and Silver Inches. A Day without Rain thoroughly shines through..."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful Voice & Music,"Five years after the release of her last original album, ""The Memory of Trees"", this remarkably talented lady has again provided music which stirs the depths of the soul. ""A Day Without Rain"" may be her most interconnected album yet. Each piece seems joined together better than on her previous albums.The only negative is the relative brevity of this work. Still, 35 minutes of new Enya is better than no new Enya. My personal favorites on this album are ""Only Time"" and ""One by One"".Any fan of Enya will enjoy this new release. Her music is beautiful and she has an incredibly talented voice. Hopefully it won't be 5 years till her next new release."
5,One of her best works ever,"I have been a long time fan of Enya, and her fantastic style of music. When I saw this on a store shelf, I immediately bought it, even though I was oblivious that Enya had a new album out. ""Lazy Days"" is my favorite song on the CD, which reviewers have given little or no credit to. Its radiant joy will shower you from every angle. It reminds me of her other song ""On My Way Home"" from the CD ""The Memory of Trees"". ""Wild Child"" is also an instant hit, and will have you coming back for more, and the first track ""A Day Without Rain"" is highly reminiscent of ""No Holly For Miss Quinn"".This is a breathtaking album, only surpassed, I believe, by her ""Watermark"" CD. If you like Enya even the least bit, I recommend buying this awesome and inspiring CD as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed, nor will you ever regret this CD. You might want to order 2 or 3 copies of it, though, as you will probably wear it out playing it so often."
4,Sounds dreamy to me! What did you expect?,"This cd is great, it's no change from Enya's previous releases, why change the formula when it works? I recommend this cd to everyone but if your looking for a new and improved sound from Enya, keep waiting. I enjoyed it. My only complaint is it wasn't long enough."
3,Will she ever exhaust her resevoir of soul stirring ideas?,"Regretably, it's beginning to look like it. This album is far too short (34 minutes) and all the tracks remind me of her earlier works. Which is a shame, because each of her earlier albums were distinctive and unique.What puzzles me is why the new tracks ""Only If"" and ""Paint The Sky With Stars"" were not included. These two tracks (found on Best of Enya) are brilliant enough to have made this CD worth buying. I reccommend you buy Best of Enya and leave this one be."
2,Ho-Hum...,"This is a very tired and shallow attempt here. It seems to me not only that we've heard all this stuff before; but it's also so lackluster, so dreary, so full of drudgery...I have been an Enya fan for over a decade, but this is not the best collection to begin with if you're new to her work. This is a collection for the PC campus feminists who want their music dowdy, saccharine, and cloying...Stick with her earlier work; it's more powerful, more provocative, and more contemplative. There's nothing here worth listening to.--dan"
1,Enya - A Day Without Rain,"This CD is not worth the price. It is only 35 minutes long, half the time of regular CD's and at the full CD price. Just thought buyers should beware."
2,This is not the Enya I came to love,"Where's the beautiful and timeless music of _The Celts_, _Watermark_ (my favorite album ever), and _Shepherd Moons_? Definitely nowhere to be found on _A Day Without Rain_. I had been disappointed with _The Memory Of Trees_, but at least that album still showed a spark of originality on songs like the title track, ""Tea-House Moon"", and a couple others. Though _A Day Without Rain_ has a few beautiful songs like ""Wild Child"" and ""Fallen Embers"", most of the album follows a totally predictable pattern. Will Enya ever return to her _Watermark_ and _The Celts_ glory days? I'm starting to lose my hopes."
2,Feel Like I'm Underwater and Stuck In Atlantis!,"If you are thinking of buying this as a gift for someone, keep looking, is my advice. That's how it came to me. I can't say this is terrible music because it isn't. However, I feel as if I'm underwater in Atlantis while listening to it. Is this New Age music? If it is, I don't think I'm going to be a fan of it. Another reviewer mentioned that if you were an artist, you might like painting to this. I AM an artist and I can't imagine painting to this as it is too blah. I'd worry my art work would come out too blah, or maybe soggy. This just isn't me. I notice there are 3 used ones already for sale on this page which doesn't hugely surprise me. What age person likes this music? It might be good in a hospital or nursing home setting as it is restful is my only thought. You could carry parts of it right over to your funeral too because sections sound like underwater dirges. Thank God a Sade album was included in the gift package along with this one!"
1,A Day Full of Pain,"Or ""A Day Without Gain,"" or ""Enya's Attempt at Substanceless Pop."" Needless to say, I was enraged after purchasing this CD. Not only is it barely over 1/2 an hour long and costing full price, but it has the poppest lyrics of any of her recordings yet! For example, the subjects on ""A Day Without Rain"" have fallen from the innovative first person singular to the typical maintstream ""you"" of pop. Gone are any of the poetic, abstract, introspective lyrics of ""The Memory of Trees."" The layers have been stripped away and what we get in this cd is a dumbed-down, fluffed-up and washed-out version of her previous recordings. The songs all sound the same, only some are more annoying in their repetitive catch-phrases than others. If I hadn't wasted actual money on it, I'd have been rolling on the floor laughing at the magnitude of the commercial fluff exponent to which this latest of enya's recordings has been raised."
1,Derivative to the Extreme,"I must disagree with the preponderance of positive reviews of this latest by Enya. I believe she peaked with her first work, when she burst onto the scene with ""Shepherds Moon,"" which I thought was exceptional in every respect. This album is just the latest in a very minor variation of the thematic core established years ago by Enya, in terms of the synthesized music that seems to force her admittedly beautiful voice into the background along with the lyrics. Listening to the mere 34 minutes was an exercise akin to staying to see how a bad movie ends. Enya should take an emotional cue from her sister, Maire Brennan, and her other relatives in Clannad. ""A Day Without Rain"" is flat, monotonous, repetitive, and a major disappointment."
1,Only for the weak hearted....,"This album is for the weak. The main audience compromises of people with mid life crisis. Its just boring and not uplifting. Also, as someone else pointed out, seems like every song uses the same formula. There is no variety in this one. Only Time is one of the most depressing songs, that could seriously drive a person to suicide."
1,Put simply- this sucked,"from hearing all the hype about enya's new cd, i thought, ""wow. i must get it, it should be great."" I was sooo wrong. From the second i listend to it i thought i must have had the wrong cd. Yeah, in some of the songs she has a good voice, but the is no rythem and the lyrics are horrible. It is a complete waist of money and people should pay you to listen to it. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!"
1,Yawn.........,"I'am probably going to get about 20 non helpful votes for this review,but I just want to tell you the truth,if you die-hard Enya fans think you can handle it.This type of music called New Age is the most absolute worst type of music out there.It is nothing more than boring sound,sometimes boring sounds with humming type singing that is more impossible to understand than most Death Metal lyrics.Enya is a perfect example of boring sounds mixed with humming type singing.The songs on this CD,just like on any other New Age CD,can very easily put you to sleep.These songs are lame,boring,and totally useless.If you are looking for true female talent,check out Khia's new single My Neck My Back(uncenscored version).Most of you will vote this review not helpful,but I am just telling nothing but the truth."
1,Musical Genius?,"Enya is anything but a musical genius.Her music is boring,lame,dull,and pitiful.People like Elvis Presley are REAL musical genius'.However,Enya does not fall into the category of musical genius.I would reccomend skipping anything that involves Enya.Hope my review helped."
2,She sing so soft i could barely hear her!,"I don't know but where i come from people have to talk loud to be noticed and this is no exception. I thought it was poetic, even sad, and downright unbearable as some of the songs. when it started out the first song i could barely stand the loneliness of the feeling of the song. but i wanted to hear how she sound LIVE without the benefit of the voice overs and studio sound enhancement. i dont think that she would sound very good live. The cd was short but it fit into the context i guess sort of like a mini play or a project. it did work together with the placement of songs. But i dont think she would sound very good live. Celine Dion needs to show her a lesson in singing live. She needs to open up her throat-hole and EMOTE EMOTE EMOTE. Thats the secret of Celine's success. You ever heard the expression 'The squeaky wheel gets the grease', well enya needs to sing LOUDLY. Celine needs to groom her.Thank you."
3,My review,"The album has some very good tracks, the music is relaxing and soft. Enya has proved to make some of the best relaxing music and this album confirms this.I gave it 3 stars because of the recording. Enya`s vocal is so bright, it sounds like her throat is dry like a desert or somebody is trying to choke her. The background music is recorded badly, the instruments are not defined very well."
3,"A slow moving day, a nice lazy day","This is pretty nice. But after awhile, it's all the same- feel/ type of song. I can't listen to the whole thing at once for that reason, in a way it becomes monotonous. But the songs themselves can be good. ""Only Time"" can have a bewitching effect of being in love (with the song) on you.My favorite line: ""Who can say when the day sleeps/ if the night keeps all your heart""Also, in the lyric book of this album, the pictures of Enya looks to me kind of like Winona Ryder."
3,A couple good tunes - that's it,"I bought two albums simultaneously, Watermark and A Day Without Rain. Watermark is by far the superior album, with a better mix of tunes and simply more intersting and varied songs. Example: I've listened to A Day Without Rain once, and Watermark five times in the first month since I purchased them both.Besides the cover track, none of the songs really stick out in my mind as being that great. And the whole album tends to blend together. I can't recommend this album, though it would make nice background music when one wants to relax. Musically, nothing sophisticated."
5,A Fan's Opinion,Enya could be called the artist of the age. I am a great fan of hers and have most of her music.
3,A day without rain...an album without...,"I have always liked Enya and i have singed these ""Sail away,sail away"" lyrics million times.Thus,when the new album ""a day without rain"" came out,i immediately rushed to a record store and bought it,only to discover that it's an album without what i loved about her music.Every new Enya album always had something different to a previous one,but this seemed to be too much of the same.I felt like a had already heard these songs...as a result i went back to the past albums.Some tracks are nice,i.e.:Only time,Wild child,Tempus Vernum and A day without rain,but the album seems to be more pop than new age...if you are ok with that, then you will love this,personally,however, i prefer Watermark and Shepherd Moons...dissapointing."
3,Not nearly enough,"OK, so after a few listens it's real nice (altho no standout tunes present themselves quite yet). But 34 minutes long? Twenty years ago, a 34 minute LP would've been considered short, but tolerable for $5.99. But in this day and age (and price), there is no excuse for such short-sheeting. Given the style of music involved, what would've been wrong with extending some or all of the songs for an extra 3 minutes each, with extended instrumentals? As it stands, this CD smacks of a quick holiday release to rake in the bucks from unsuspecting slobs like me and thee. Plan on programming it to play twice."
5,Enya is simply the Best Ever!,"The first time I heard of Enya (consequently, she is named after a Moon Goddess in Celtic Mythology) was Book of Days. I was stunned to feel the energy, passion, and exquisite majesty of someone I longed to hear and did doth I listen. Her mystical charm graced all her albums and nary did I ever miss a song. ""Only Time"", like so many others, hit me so emotionally that I cried as usual--I was at the movies watching the preview of ""Sweet November"". I think the thing I love about Enya the most is how her music is healing, setting somber thoughts free, full of hope springs eternal. Surely, after 30 million sold and no live performances, you can say she is Simply the Best. -Felecia Constance Rowe, Chairwoman, Teardropfilms, Ltd."
4,Great present,"I got this cd for a gift on Christmas Day. Although I had heard of Enya, I didn't have any of her cds. I loved this album. My only complain is that it's too short. My favorite songs are: Tempus Vernum, Only Time, Falling Embers, A Day without Rain and the one in celtic. A beautiful gift to give to anyone."
4,Nice But Short,"At 34-and-a-half minutes long, this wonderful album is like sitting down for a sumptious meal, but the portions are small! Evidently Enya has striven for quality instead of quantity on this work and in that she has once again succeeded; indeed, just the selections ""Fallen Embers"" or ""A Day Without Rain"" make the album definitely ""worth it"" for me. Roma Ryan's soul-opening lyrics are again a perfect complement to Enya's angelic singing and flowing orchestral arrangements. If you enjoy purity, grace, sensitivity and wisdom, this album is for you."
5,"If you are an Enya fan, you MUST buy this one!","I wish I could tell you all how much I enjoy this album!I'm not a music reviewer or an expert by any means. Just an everyday gal --you know, the kind that has to do a thousand things in just a few hours?Listening to this collection ""grounds"" and re-centers me. I listen to it daily while I work. It brings peace to my chaotic day and inspires further creation.I enjoy a wide variety of styles of music, and I continually find myself coming back to Enya and her work.Tracks like Wild Child and Only Time are two of my favorite.If you buy it I'm sure you, too, will enjoy the work of this unique artist!"
3,Definitely Enya - but is that good or bad?,"I love Enya's previous albums (Shepherd Moon is my favorite), some of the most beautiful sounds I've ever heard, but this album sounds just like Memory of Trees - nothing new. Maybe I've outgrown her, or maybe not. I'll keep this one, but it's not fresh enough to earn a frequent ride in the cd-player."
4,Enya is Enya,"I bought this CD for 'Only Time' which is a beautiful song. Then as I was watching CNN and a clip of the terrorist attack in NY, the background music was 'Fallen Embers' from this CD. It's taken a new meaning for me...and I'll forever remember 9/11/01 when I listen to this CD."
3,A bit on the short side,"Given the length of time between CD releases I would have thought Enya could have given us more than the measly 34 minutes of music she provides on this release. There's no excuse for anything less than 45 minutes or so of new music on todays large capacity CD's. I suspect she's been suffering from a creativity lapse. Whats there is certainly pleasant to listen to, but there's nothing new here; just the same format as her earlier CD's."
4,It's not bad but-where's the soul ?,"Enya has always had a great voice-Diva class I think. ""Wild Child"" is my favorite it makes even though it makes no sense-it's something new. Pilgrim is a bit overworked, it over emphasizes the split road theme (again). I hate ""Only Time"" it sounds just like ""China Roses"" All are very beautiful and give my woofer a good workout, but this album seems to have a bit of ""hey the boss said don't make your stuff so creepy and wierd because we want a wider audience."" so I think that's were some of the intense emotion that was evident in previous albums has gone. But this as with the other albums takes a few repeat listenings before it grows on you."
1,mind numbing,"Well, we have finally discovered an alternative to novacaine in the dentist's office. This drivel put me to sleep in 10 seconds! The simplistic repetitive droning is a waste of time and money. Yes, she has a lovely voice, but this is some of the most boring ""music"" ever recorded. Anyone who likes this stuff needs to get out more often and try other forms of real music!"
1,BORING!!,"How can aybody sit through this type of music.It is way too dull and boring.I would not prefer listening to this when you are driving in your car,because you might fall asleep at the wheel.As a matter of fact,I would not prefer listening to this anywhere.When I hear people listening to this,I am always wondering,""How can they stand that type of music?"".This CD is dull,boring,and a waste of time and money.Do yourself a favor and listen to some rap and some alternative rock.That is real music.Peace Out."
1,"Dull, Dull, Desperately, Desperately, Dull!","This stuff doesn't belong in music stores. It belongs in the presecription medicine aisle of your local chemists or 'drug store' - under 'Sleep Aids'. But it must stay as prescription only. If too many people start playing this during daylight hours, entire city blocks could be sent to sleep, with catastrophic results. Drivers would zonk out at the wheel, nuclear power workers would doze through developing meltdowns, office workers would fall asleep and fail to do any meaningful work all day - okay, that last one's pretty much normal. But you see what I mean. Side effects of chronic uncoolness and middle-agedness also need to be worried about."
1,Money Waster,"Don't waste your sweet cash on this. The rythemic patterns are extremely uneven, only to disturb the brain waves. Truly entertaining pieces of works are done by Linkin Park and Disturbed. Secondly, Enya's lyrics have no meaning at all. All she does is just hum.. other bands, such as the ones i have mentioned, at least have meaning.- Dr. Adrian Sheppard"
3,Good but not great,I like Enya a lot but I think this is one of her poorer albums. It just didn't give me the chills that some of her outher albums do.
3,"It's just OK, not anything new","Let's face it, the wait wasn't worth it for this one. Enya says that she goes to great lengths to work on her compositions, providing layers and harmonies that are very pleasing to the ear. I really wanted to like this CD as much as others, but found that the music was rather dull and uninspired. I did play cuts 2 and 3 on the radio, but other than those, the CD sounds like the background material on many of her other releases. If you are a die-hard fan of Enya's then by all means go for it. If you want to try out her music go for ""Watermark"" or ""A Day without Rain"", not this one."
2,Five years for a half hours time?,"Let me make this clear. I love Enya. But this album is a very poor offering. The songs are unremarkable and sound like leftovers that she hadn't been able to record previously. Nothing very original here. I had been anticipating a new from Enya for several months and sadly, was very disappointed. This is a good addition for rabid Enya fans or for those who'd like to make their collection complete, but if you give it a pass, you really won't be missing anything."
4,Perfect Technique,"This CD sounds exactly the same as all of her other CDs. It is a hard rocking collection of depressing ditties. While some people dismiss her work as Mongolian Punk Rock, I think this is the future of music as we know it. Fortunately, this music's real depth is in the lack of emotion behind the techno melodies."
3,Tanya Dreyser,"I was introduced to Anya's records in 1993. I purchased three of her records, at least. She is definitely a very talented artist. But, unfortunately, I heard the same elements in every single record. The same arrangements, same musical structure, same sound, same orchestration.I wish Anya could diversify her directions in the areas of the interpretation and the styles.It is great to hear the same or almost the same music twice, after that it does not sound interesting."
5,Hauntingly beautiful...!,"I have been a fan of Enya for the past several years and own her entire collection. The first time I heard ""Only Time"" in trailers for Sweet November, it sent shivers through me...and still does. Her voice is so haunting and goes into your very soul. An EXCELLENT CD...as always!"
5,THE BEST,"""A Day Without Rain"" is my favourite Enya album. Filled with plenty tranquil classic enya pieces including the smash first single, ""Only Time"". Also includes the awesome instrumental title track ""A Day Without Rain"". A must buy, you won't be disappointed. If you loved ""The Memory of Trees"", this will be ten times better."
2,Nothing to write home,"I've really liked Enya over the years and have all her CD's, so I was looking forward to this one.Unfortunately, there's really nothing new here. All the songs sound the same -- they sound like Enya, but they're all the same. You can't tell from this album if you're listening to ""A Day W/O Rain"" or someother previous album. Actually, since the songs are all the same, it's easy to tell the album.So if you're starting out, do yourself a favor and start with an earlier (and much more interesting) album."
4,"Short, but sweet","Yes, folks - it is short, but it IS pretty sweet. So many complaints of it sounding just like ALL of her other music - but I don't hear that (at least not 100 percent like some alledge.) The music has changed some - for the better mostly. The lyric writing by Roma has greatly improved, too - she really seems to have come into her own on this CD. (Remember, Enya's ""music"" is a team effort here folks - she writes the music first, then turns over some of the tunes to Roma to come up with lyrics for them.) I'm hoping she can come up with a way to do some live appearances soon - as well as building her next studio effort so that there's not a FIVE year wait for the next CD!"
3,"Good, but not Earth-Shattering","Enya has discovered a winning formula and sticks to it tenaciously, which means that there's relatively little in the way of innovation on her new CD. Her music is undoubtedly beatiful, but we've heard it all (more-or-less) before; and it's difficult to detect the sort of profound artistic development which is evident in the work of someone like Loreena Mckennitt. The CD struck me as far too short (some 38 minutes), and some songs are incredibly brief. In addition, the Latin grammar of ""Tempus Vernum"" is non-existant and some of its pronunciation is bad. All in all, ""A Day Without Rain"" is a pleasant and mellow CD which I recomend to fans of Enya, and anyone looking for a light and pleasant (but not especially profound) ""New Age"" album."
5,Beyond Ethereal,"This album is wonderful! I've listened to Enya for such a long time and this album keeps reinforcing her ethereal vocals interlaced with dreamlike music. It's a superb CD, you won't be let down."
4,This CD is definitly worth a listen,"I absolutly love this CD. It has a heavenly fresh sound to it that brings serinity to my mind when I listen to it. It brings peaceful thoughts to my head such as looking at clouds or laying in flowers. This CD is a great de-stresser, and it's especially ideal for things such as practicing yoga or for playing in your car during rush hour traffic. It's also musical enough that you could listen to it and get some musical enrichment from it. The only thing that kept me from giving the album a fifth star is the fact that her album is layed down just like some of her others, beggining with a beautiful piano ballad, and well, if you listen to Enya, you know the rest. However, in this album, Enya experiments with more sounds wrapped in her music, making it richer than usual. Definitly a great buy!"
1,TOTALLY STALE SOUND,"This is simply a rehash of very other lame Enya CD that you have ever heard. I liked Shepard moons and Watermark, but this CD offers absolutely nothing new. Its the same sound, recipe, formula that she has doled out to us countless times now. I think she is either incredibly lazy, cares only about profits, or is creatively bankrupt, maybe a combination of the three. Her last two CDs are the last Enya CDs I will purchase."
2,"The Worst Ever of Enya, go for Loreena","If your looking for celtic insported music like Enya used to make, hunt for the artist Loreena McKennitt. A day without rain is Enyas definitively worst album ever. She was one of my favoirites, and I can't really forgive her for putting out something as dreadful as this CD. Bad Enya, you could do SO much better than this, and until you do, McKennitt is the answer :)"
1,yawn,"I'm a fan of enya's music BUT this new album sounds like every other one she's released over the years. Each and every song on ""a day without rain"" could've been added to her previous releases. It's been 5 years between albums... she should've came back with something new, innovative and different. Insetead, you get the same old flat chants, and endless plucking strings. Try again enya."
3,Same old stuff...,"Enya has an average voice. If I had that much electronic ""stuff"" happening around me, I could sound whispy and angelic too. But it's an over-produced gimic designed to prey upon the unthinking fan base of the original Enya recordings. In the past decade or so, she has virtually been entirely predictible, and is now boring.I would challenge the producer to look into something new in order to avoid overuse of the style that has made this artist famous. But to do that would be to ensure career suicide. Put her alone without the synthetic sound, and the voice will put you to sleep... not in the good way. I'm bored!"
3,"Not the best, that's for sure","As a huge Enya fan, I am disapointed. The 34 minutes of music was much shorter than the other albums. (When the CD stopped, I actually thought there was something wrong with my player.) And the music that was on the CD all sounded the same. THere was no new sound, no new inovation, and each song sounded just like the previous.If you are a new Enya listener, start with Paint the Stars, her ""Best of"" album. And if she does a second ""Best of"" none of these songs will on it."
5,At least is modern and creative...not like this old beatles,At leats this is a modern and creative music...always changing... This could be in first place and not beatles...Enya is a pleasure to our mind...not a repetitive mix of noises.
5,beautiful ethereal sound,"I love the new age, ethereal sound of Enya. She has beautiful words to say in her songs and just listening to this album can make that headache go away. From the carefree mood of ""Wild Child"" to the serious ""Pilgrim"" to the all instrumental title track ""A Day Without Rain"" to the somberness of ""Only Time,"" this album was evidently made with deep thought. Enya does not disappoint on her new releases; she took 5 years to roll out this one and it's worth giving a listen to."
4,Good mood music,Its a great CD to have in the office. It has a little bit of pick me up attitude but is mellow enough not to distract the guy next door.
4,"Not enough Gaelic, doggone it.","It may sound odd but that was one of my objections to this recording. It's beautiful, don't get me wrong, and I've loved all of her albums, but it just seemed like she went too mainstream on this one. It sounds too ""pop"", really."
4,Really Good CD,"I love this CD. I've given almost half the tracks (five) excellent ratings, while two more get really good ratings. Of the remaining four tracks, two get good ratings and, unfortunately, two get merely OK ratings (that's why I can't give the overall CD an Excellent). In general, Enya manages to do this by producing beautiful, calming music that doesn't just fade into the background (which those two ""OKs"" do). It stays in the foreground and makes you listen to it. My specific track ratings are:1. A Day Without Rain -- 5 Stars2. Wild Child -- 5 Stars3. Only Time -- 5 Stars4. Tempus Vernum -- 2 Stars5. Deora Ar Mo Chroi -- 2 Stars6. Flora's Secret -- 4 Stars7. Fallen Embers -- 3 Stars8. Silver Inches -- 5 Stars9. Pilgrim -- 4 Stars10. One By One -- 5 Stars11. Lazy Days -- 3 Stars"
3,Somewhat dissapointed,"I was a bit dissapointed with this release. I am a long time Enya fan, and found this one a little too much of the same thing. Too many strings, not enough of the beautiful vocals she does so well."
3,A DAY WITHOUT RAIN IS WATERED DOWN,"Don't get me wrong I love Enya, especially ""Shepherd Moons"" and my all time favorite from 1987 ""Celts"" and the one that got her on the map ""Watermark"" with her only Top 40 hit ""Orinoco Flows"".But Enyas latest ""A Day Without Rain"" is becoming to sound like the same ole', same ole' but more of a drowned out version.I feel that since ""Celts"" Enya has been creatively losing her sound and style little by little, and it definitely shows now with ""A Day Without Rain"".My favorites are ""Silver Inches"", ""Pilgrim"" and ""Fallen Embers"", but that doesn't help the rest of this CD which fades into back ground elevator music.It is not a bad album by any means, but it is just not her best effort.I say if you want to get to know Enya purchase her earlier works first, especially ""Celts""."
2,Years without Enya,"Along with so many others, I anxiously awaited for the newest release from Enya having enjoyed all of her previous releases. The only reason I give this release two stars is because the same outstanding production quality was evident throughout. Artistically, I'm convinced that these tracks are nothing more than out-takes from previous albums - perhaps fleshed out a bit more for the actual release.What a disappointment.I'm sure the Enya ""team"" has lots of really good reasons to release such an album - perhaps personal illness, contractual pressure from the record company, pay the bills, etc.Please don't do it again."
5,Beautiful,Anything by Enya is usually wonderful and this CD will not disappoint. She has such a beautiful voice and each song has a totally different feel.
5,I Agree that ENYA and GENIE are unbeatable,"I have to add my voice to the chorus and state emphatically that if you love this CD, as I do, you simply must check out the 4 CD set by this amazing AMISH artist named GENIE."
3,Other Enya albums are more enchanting,"If you are filling out a collection of music, this is a fine album. However, Enya's ""Watermark"" and ""Shepard Moons"" are, in my opinion, stronger performances, and more listenable."
3,Good album but not her best,"As a fan of Enya, I must confess that this does not compare to ""Watermark"" or ""Shepherd Moons"". I found only two tracks that were good, the rest sounded hackneyed. I think a gap of four years should have led to a more distinct body of music. I love Celtic music and the the songs are nice but I was looking for Enya to establish her own style which does not happen.As far as Celtic music is concerned I find that Enya is increasingly tilting towards ""pop celtic"" tunes and a lot of her compositions are sounding very similar. Other artists like Loreena McKennitt and, of course, the Chieftains are much more versatile and prolific.Buy this album if you are a Enya fan but otherwise buy the ""Book of Secrets"" by McKennitt."
4,Who says Enya is boring?,"Enya's music still sounds the same as before, but who says she's boring?There's no need for electric guitars and stuffs to make the music sound nice... If this is so, masterpieces from the Classical period would have been thrown into the bin right now...!Enya has not ran out of creativity. The album reflects Enya's unique personal style which she is persistant in throughout the years. Her sense of personal style is so strong that you can hear the music and say ""Ah... That's Enya, right?"" even though you have never heard the piece before!Personally, I think ""Wild Child"" and ""Only Time"" are the most beautiful tracks in this album. They are beautifully sang and the orchestration is good.The other tracks are simply refreshing and heavenly. Listen to it and you will not be disappointed! Buy it!"
2,Brevity is the soul of wit? Errr...,"I have been an Enya fan for over six years, but I must say, I was sorely disappointed by her newest release. Not only was I stunned when my CD player quickly ran through the album and began anew (the 11 song description is deceiving), but the songs are, shall we say... edited versions of her previous albums? Seriously, every melody reminds me of either Watermark or the Memory of Trees. If you enjoy getting your money's worth, don't buy this album. Yes, the sounds are ""pretty,"" but they lack the normal breathtaking quality of Enya's work."
4,Not quite more of the same,"At first listen, this album sounds pretty much just like the albums that have come before it, only, because it's all so familiar, one might feel cheated that there is really nothing new. Every song on it instantly reminds me of a similar song on a previous CD. And yet, even though I felt that way, I put it on constant repeat for about three days after I brought it home. Enya has abandoned a lot of her synthesized experiments and here is relying on simple chording and her own voice, ably enhanced by production technique. The result, as always, is restful but not boring. The melodies sound familiar to anyone accustomed to her style, but they will not let you go, and they are new."
3,"Same 'ol Enya, nothing new or improved","If this was my first exposure to Enya, or if I were looking for the same stylish genre, sound, originality and feel of her previous works, I would give it 4 stars. But, she ventures nowhere new in this CD, and it lacks the more dramatic, creative, and captivating tracks as are found on Watermark, Shepherd's Moon, or The Celts. A Day Without Rain seems to be a continuation of The Memory of Trees, only slightly duller. It's nice music, but doesn't call to be listened to over again as her other works do."
3,5 Year Wait for 35 minutes of Music,"The music on the CD is very good, typical Enya. To my ear that is the problem. I was anticipating some evolution and imagination. My biggest problem however is spending $14.00-15.00 on a 35 minute CD. One song is less than one minute and 30 seconds! Why bother.Unless your a true Enya lover buy her best of CD instead!"
2,Same thing done less well,"I was a real fan of Enya and Celtic/New Age music in general, but Enya needs to mature. She needs to bring her voice down out of la-la land and sing in that rich lower register that is heard on some of the selections. Otherwise it is the same old thing, but not as good. Her themes don't seem as clear as earlier albums either. Don't know what's going on exactly. A shame."
3,"I am a huge Enya fan, but slightly disapointed","If you are new to Enya and don't own any cds, get either watermark, shepard moons, memory of trees, or paint the sky with stars. This newest cd is very short and sounds exactly like her other cds. You can hear clear differences in the first 3 cds, but the newer ones just sort of sound the same but with new words.I am glad she put out a new cd since I am a huge fan and like hearing new stuff. But I would have liked it to be a little longer, differen't or something...If you haven't heard Loreena McKennitt, you should run (don't walk) and get her CDS. You won't be disapointed."
4,"Good Enya CD, but lean on playing time","Prior to getting this album, I felt that quality and quantity of each of Enya's albums were ""just right."" They did not leave me feeling that there could be more that could have been included. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent album to get. It's just that I thought it was on the short side time-wise. Maybe I'm too picky in this case or maybe one can never get enough of Enya."
2,way too big and bulky,"My son is nine, and thought the idea of a vibrating watch would be great to remind him to check his blood sugar while at summer camp. This watch band has to wrap TWICE around his wrist, which makes the face of the watch stick up really high. So it looks huge on him, and to add to it, his friends all told him it looked ""baby-ish"" so there is no way he will wear it. I spent $100 on this watch that he is now mortified to wear."
5,Barry's Best Bond,"Of all the Bond scores, 'Goldinger' has always been my personal favorite. As the movie is also my favorite Bond film, the score holds a special place with me, bringing some good memories. The newly expanded score CD replaces 4 tracks there were on the original UK LP, that was not released in the US. 'The Laser' is actually one of my favorite tracks from the entire album. Thanks to EMI for its fine remastering and expansion of this classic Bond score."
3,"Unquestionably famous, but not the best Bond soundtrack","Shirley Bassey's incredible voice gave the title song power and timelessness, and everyone should know the opening bars of ""Goldfinger."" But sadly enough, the soundtrack is weak simply because it's so repetitive. Most of the pieces sound the same, based on the main theme. When I heard this album over 20 years ago, I listened to it over and over to see if maybe I missed something. I didn't. It's not bad, but compared to other John Barry soundtracks for Bond, especially the soundtrack for ""From Russia, With Love"" that came out the previous year, it's very forgettable."
2,decent workouts but there are FAR better workout programs out there,there are some decent workout routines in this book but the instructor barely takes the time to go over anything with you like most dvd's do. At some points you feel like Its pretty much just him doing his own workout at a gym and a hidden camera just happens to be there. Your better off just going to a gym and copying some random persons workout that you see. I personally recommend p90x or beachbody insanity for a full and complete workout routine.
2,Not what to be expected - great circuit training and lighting,"I am dissapointed that this was not a step by step format- he zips through the routine with no explanation. I am sorry I did not get value from my $4.00 rental fee. Great lighting and great circuit routine, motivation for kick-boxers out there."
5,Great Motivation,This was the perfect way to figure out how to add to my routine. Julien has a great body and it definitely helped my motivation.
4,Repetitive,"I still can't understand why there was no official US release for this great track. If there was, you wouldnt be shelling out more to get this import edition.That said, the import edition is wonderful, with 4 tracks, including the original that was on the soundtrack. 'Try again' is a song with excellent beats and Aaliyah's voice is much better than her contemporaries such as Brandy and Monica, but the song suffers due to its repetitive nature. 'If at first you dont succeed...' is about the only line here, and its a wonder that the song ,managed to reach No. 1 in the US solely based on airplay. Thats no mean achievement, and certainly a reason to buy this CD, and find out what all the fuss was about.Highly recommended."
5,Best political rock album out there,"The lyrics are powerful, both musically and politically. The Perry brothers are not afraid to say and explain their views, and do so to a rocking beat. If you are politically aware and a music lover, but don't have this album, then you are all wet!"
5,This album kills fascists!,"As a leftist student 20 years ago, this unabashedly socialist album was the perfect antidote to the Reaganism and Thatcherism that seemed to have consumed many of my peers. In 2008, even though many of the references are dated, the revolutionary spirit rings true -- now more than ever, given the dire state of the world. What's truly sad is that no one has the guts to make a record like this now. Get this, to wash the taste of Bush, Blair, and Brown out of your mouth."
3,Fun read,"This is a fun book - full of short tales of inventions which may or may not affect the future. I first read it in 1990 and at a second glance recently I noticed how tame the predictions were. Most were consumer-oriented items or fantasy ideas (floating furniture for easy cleaning) but several have become reality - stitches that fade, food wrappings that one can eat, windows that lighten or darken or allow more or less heat into a room.The organization is simple - a few chapters with small vignettes about the product accompanied by a drawing of same. Of added interest were two additional items: Predictions of when the product would appear and the percent chance of its development."
4,THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY HAMMER CD I NEED,"ALL OF HAMMER'S BEST SONGS FROM HIS HEYDAYS ARE ON THIS CD. THIS AND ''THE FUNKY HEADHUNTER'' ARE THE ONLY HAMMER CDS YOU SHOULD EVER NEED. ALL OF THE BEST SONGS ARE HERE, SUCH AS ''U CAN'T TOUCH THIS'', ''LET'S GET IT STARTED'', ''HERE COMES THE HAMMER'', ''TURN THIS MUTHA OUT'', AND MORE. THESE SONGS MAKE GREAT PARTY SONGS. GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE TO DISS HAMMER, BUT DON'T WORRY, I KNOW BETTER. AFTER ALL, ''PLEASE HAMMER DON'T HURT EM'' IS TIED WITH TLC'S ''CRAZYSEXYCOOL'' FOR THE GREATEST SELLING RAP ALBUM OF ALL TIME!"
5,HAMMER!,"Been listening to this guy since I was like 5, had the dolls and everything! Listen to ""Let's get it started"" to really get amped!"
2,"Good, but not the greatest","This is supposedly Hammer's greatest hits. I have all of his albums and this CD leaves out a lot of stuff. It has nothing from The Funky Headhunter, which is his best album. The CD has a lot more potential to put more songs on it, but they decided not to. The only good thing about this album that it has the 5 min version of Turn This Mutha Out, compared to the 2:30 min version on Let's Get It Started. I reccomend just getting this CD used, its not worth the full price."
3,Great for semi-fans of M.C. Hammer,"If you like the radio hits of M.C. Hammer, this is the CD for you. I am not the biggest fan of the guy so I never bought any of his albums. I've heard some of them, but they never did anything for me. I did like the popular stuff though... and most of those songs are right here on this collection. So help M.C. Hammer get out of financial debt and buy this album today!"
5,This is my favorite cd!,"I listen to this cd for 3 or 4 hours a day.I like songs 1,2,6,7,10and11.This cd is really good. advice git it."
2,average but entertainning,"say what you will about Hammer but 10 years back he was huge.not a good rapper or original lyricist but he could rock a stage and dance like fire.at one time he was calling Michael Jackson out to challenge on stage.U can't touch this be it good or bad changed the way how far a sampled song could go.you think Puffy wasn't taking notes? i still dig Rick James's Super freak better.i give Hammer props for helping his people from his hood out also for bringing Live Instruments back on stage.he was doing things with Earth,Wind&fire way before Coolio got with Lakeside.he had his moment in the sun so don't front&hate now.also enough already judge & jury about artists Po-Po problems you either like there work or you don't stick to the music.Hammer was show biz alot of folks today could learn presentation from him."
4,"I'm shaking my ""Pumps in da But""","I'm only giving this greatest hits 4 stars instead of 5 because they didn't put Pumps in the But on this set - why, I don't know, but, they missed it on this one. Otherwise, I loved MC Hammer, because, his music was fun and positive, before the gangster rappers took over and made rapping ugly."
1,I almost puked,Hearing these songs made me nautious. The only good song is Cant Touch This. Dont buy this crap chicken head music.
1,85 Delorean bettah check yo'self,"Sorry bud, ya iz mistaken about da baby got back song. That song wuz sang by Sir Mix a-lot. Hope dis here helps, take care slap mah fro yo! 'Dis album get 1 star cuz no ""Pumps N Da Bump""!!"
4,Eye-opening,"This was one of the most eye-opening books I've ever read, especially on the topic of prayer. It helped me to see the different types of intercessors and the value of each one. If you want to understand WHY you pray about the things you do, and WHY you pray the way you do, this book is a great resource for you."
3,Not Too Bad a Story,"Although there were some glaring errors in this book, I didn't find it that bad a story. Bogie comes across pretty realistic, and the sneak peaks that we get at big names is always fun in these books. This book's time frame is supposed to take place around the time that Bogart was filming the Maltese Falcon, and the story runs a parallel storyline to that great Dashiell Hammett story, only in this case they're looking for a missing cornucopia filled with priceless jewels. The stakes are high and before the missing artifact is found, three bodies are found. One of the killed was Bogie's and his wife Mayo's housekeeper so Bogie feels he must get involved in order to solve the mystery of who killed her in his house."
5,Bitter? huh?,"I also don't understand the one reviewers comments. Compared to Hershey's 60 and 65% dark chocolates, Hachez 88% is really smooth with just enough sweetness to combat any possible bitterness."
3,Short & Sweet,"I enjoyed the book, but it doesn't even come close to being a favorite. It has great art, really clean lines. You can see folks like these walking around on the streets. Perhaps that's the problem, folks may look like these people but they sure don't act like these people. Every character is portrayed as eccentric and illogical, leaving them feeling completely unrealistic. I found it kind of shallow in the end, it feels like a hipster comic. Between this and Optic Nerve, choose the latter. Optic Nerve has a real liveliness to it, which is what I found lacking here."
4,Summer Frustrations,I appreciated each story and enjoyed it just as much as Short Comings. There is definitely a finger print his story telling. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to read something different and enjoys watching paneled train wrecks.
4,Sumer Blone,"Before anyone reads Summer Blonde, I strongly recommend that they first read The Complete Optic Nerve Mini-Comics and Sleepwalk first. For me, to have read those two books first made my appreciate Summer Blonde's art and writing much more."
5,SO good!,"If you love dostoevsky then this is the book for you. You can enjoy some of the best russian literature without diving into a thick copy of The Brothers Karamarzov or Anna Karenina-you can start small with these little stories. And, if you need a copy of Notes from the Underground anyway, why not get a book with that and more?! Buy this book!"
3,Even the foreword is revealing,An interesting read. The foreword revealed some intriguing details about the author's life that I didn't know. His father was murdered by his own serfs. The author himself suffered from epileptic fits. Many of the stories have details only someone who lived through these things could accurately describe. His writing seems to stretch itself before our eyes as we read each story he wrote as time went on.
4,LOOKS AND WORKS WELL,I USED IT WITH MY A PIONEER DECK FITS NICE... BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO LOCK THE KIT IN PLACE.. BUT OVER ALL WORKS WELL.
1,The Well Adjusted Horse,"The Well Adjusted Horse: Equine Chiropractic Methods You Can DoVery disappointed; dont buy it. It is only 5"" x 7"" so the pages are very small and you have to flip lots of them to get any thing read. The first 170 are general stuff and there is only 100 pages of instrution. While this sounds like a lot the pages are so small they only contain one paragraph. Diagrams are poor and not clear what is intended. If you want a book that provides basic adjustments for your horse DONT BUY THIS ONE."
4,Pocket Sized Treasure!,"Great little book, packed with info and diagrams that all work towards solving problems before they become major issues. VERY easy to read and refer to. Highly recommended diagnosis book!"
4,Great help!,"I have had two horse, both with constant chiropractic needs!This book taught me many things I needed to know to help my horse along myself. I would recommend it to anyone with a horse to better understand the physical needs of their animal, along with the support of a good equine chiropractor and a massage therapist. Horses have back problems too!"
4,Looking forward to reading the whole series,This was a very good book. I learned alot about the time period. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
2,Loonnngggg,"I am sorry to say, but I was dreading to finish it. I was reading the book for two weeks when I usually read a book in two to three days. My thing is to finish the book that I start to read.I picked the book because it had good recommendations. For me, the plot was slow; The book had childish tone to it.Even though one of her books ""The Shepherd's Voice"" won the Rita award, I won't pick up any book by this writer anytime soon. If I do pick up any book by the same writer, it would be ""The Shepherd's Voice"".I do know a few writers that have written very good books and terrible ones as well. If you are looking for a great historical romance, look somewhere else."
4,good story,"I was so distracted trying to properly pronounce the title character's name that it was difficult to get right into the story. Too bad, because the author opens with an exciting introduction to the characters I would've enjoyed getting to know. Although entertaining, I'm not sure that I would buy the other novels in this series."
5,"Must read if you enjoy medieval settings and strong, feisty leads!","Strong Christian story with strong heroine! Love the role reversal of female champion, and enjoyed his way of leading the people to find God."
4,Maire,"I haven't read too many books where the heroine is such a strong, dominant and almost manly character. If her personality were in any other setting, I don't think I would have been able to read the book and relate to the character. Because she was raised as the future queen, I could accept her demanding impatience and blunt, rude comments to everyone as what she was taught to be in order to rule her people. Linda Windsor did a good job at showing a softer, uncertain side to Maire's character when it came to love and relationships. Rowen was the perfect hero with strength, Godly character and gentleness. I enjoyed seeing how difficult it would have been to show the Celtic people about God and have them accept Him as the one true God when their world was so full of other gods and mysticism."
4,Beautiful development of growing love.,"I really enjoyed how different Maire was for a romance novel. Medieval with druids and Christians,and Maire is a female warrior queen. Raised and trained as a warrior and queen,it takes her admiration, respect and eventually love for her hostage who she makes her husband for her to learn how to accept her feelings as a woman. Her husband Rowan is a wonderful hero.The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is there just wasn't enough closeness or kissing between them in such a sweet love story, to satisfy me."
5,Nice dishes,"We were very pleased with our new dishes. They are light, top quality and beautiful. My wife was thrilled! I highly recommend them."
3,Hugh Grant Needs Better Scripts & Better Leading Lady,"Sarah Parker's acting efforts always leave me underwhelmed. So I can't say she disappointed me in this film. I thought she was so-so which is what I always think about her acting. Hugh Grant, however, is a horse of a different color. He is a tremendous comic actor with exquisite timing. When he's got a good script and a good leading lady, he is unbeatable. His ABOUT A BOY is just one example of his performing at the top of his game. Nick Hornby was the writer on ABOUT A BOY though and he is first rate. The screenwriter of this film is no Nick Hornby. The premise is about a Manhatttan couple forced to hide out in the remote West in the witness protection program. They are married but separated yet it is quite obvious they will be getting back together. That's the whole movie. I can't say don't watch it because Grant is funny. He does the most with what he's got. The rest of the movie though is (thankfully) completely forgettable."
4,Gets better as it goes along.,"Did You Hear About the Morgans? isn't your typical romantic comedy but somehow this little movie works. I have always enjoyed writer/director Marc Lawrence's films especially Music & Lyrics. Apparently the director is a fan of Hugh Grant because this is the actor's third movie with Lawrence (the first one being Two Weeks Notice). Grant shares the romantic spotlight with the delightful Sarah Jessica Parker. Their chemistry is not very strong but I still enjoyed this awkward and quirky film. The beginning of the film is kind of wacky but after that, the story becomes more organic and funny. Everyone seems to hate this comedy but I found it rather engaging - check it out sometime!"
3,Did you hear about the Morgans?,"The trailer(seen on another DVD)led expectations to surpass the actual movie. It was entertaining in it's own way, but, not something I would recommend to others. When I asked my husband to comment, he said, ""I don't really remember it."" That just about sums it up."
3,Only if you REALLY LIKE Hugh Grant,"Ok, I love Hugh Grant, no problem admitting it. I love his rom-com movies. Yes, all of them, even Music & Lyrics. I can honestly say that I would have liked this one a million times more if there was a different actress playing the part done by Sarah Jessica Parker. She just didn't cut it in this film, and not with Grant. I think Marc Lawrence writes good comedies (love, love Two Weeks Notice) and I hope he writes more for Hugh Grant. I bought this film just because of Hugh and I do like his interview in the extras section and I always love hearing his commentary."
3,Did You Hear About the Morgans,"""Did You Hear About The Morgans?"" is okay I guess. It's been a while since I saw it. I might watch it again sometime. But I don't remember exactly being thrilled about it.It is probably just another dumb comedy. Don't if I recommend it to anyone. Maybe I can find a trailer for this one."
1,Bad acting,"The movie was very boring. Mostly, because of SJ Parker. She can't act. She was so fake that I hardly made myself to finish watching it. She had the same voice, gestures, and the whole character like Paula from ""Failure to launch"". Additionally, I was distracted by her absolutely horrible look. This is the movie when she looked the worst."
1,Really bad,"Was this a comedy? I mean there was nothing funny, and every moment was predictable. The scenes of the New York couple contending with rural life, like bears and chopping wood were horrible cliches. High Grant has made dozens of these stinkers. He has no chemistry with Sarah Jessica Parker, and she is not funny here. Bad script. Completely unrealistic. Avoid."
2,SJP is a very bad actress,"Wasnt the best-overly predictable and overdone at times. Hugh Grant was shown as a funny character and succeeded at times but not others. SJPs character was like almost all of her roles in that she is overly dramatic and frets over the dumbest things. The storyline has been done many times before. If it had been especially funny it would have been ok, but this movie was nothing special."
1,Great cast....nothing else.,"Really, a big disappointment.Hugh Grant is a master of the romantic comedy. What's he doing here? What possibilities did he see in this script?Sarah Jessica Parker, a veteran actress, is completely miscast as the love interest. No sparkle betwwen her and Mr. Grant.Same is true for Mary Steenburgen and Sam Elliott. They don't gel as a couple.Bottom line. This movie is not funny. Proven actors with stale dialogue and a weak storyline.You don't care what's happening or what's going to happen. You can't identify with the characters. That's a harsh condemnation of the script. But, if Sam Elliott can't get a rise out of you, somethings wrong.A case of a great ensemble acting bored and then boring their audience.A shame.One star for Elizabeth Moss who had the sparkle and the wit. Unfortunately, to no avail."
4,A Fun Movie!,"This movie is fun and funny. Hugh Grant has some great lines, but you have to be listening closely, you can easily miss some good ones. I recommend it to anybody who just likes a fun movie to watch."
4,Cute Movie!,"Very predictable, but very cute. A nice movie to watch when you just want to chill out, relax and feel good. And who doesn't want to look at Hugh Grant for a couple of hours?"
1,Just Awful,"I have never liked Sara Jessica Parker and, once again, she lived up to my expectations. How in the world does she continue to get roles? I'm also not much of a Hugh Grant fan but he looked like Richard Burton compared to Parker.To be fair, they didn't have a lot to work with. The dialogue was trite and hokey. I think that with some effort this could have been a decent movie but, as it was, it was just sad.I read the reviews and was warned to stay away from this movie but I didn't listen. I'll give you the same warning - save your money and time. I hope you're smarter than I was. This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in the last several years."
3,Did You Hear About the Morgans?,"A bickering New York couple on the verge of divorce is placed in the Witness Protection Program and relocated to Wyoming after witnessing a murder. Meryl and Paul Morgan have all the money a couple could want, it's love they're running short on. Upon witnessing a contract killing and being targeted by the triggerman, the couple find themselves at the mercy of the feds, who hastily send them packing for an extended stay in the Rockies. ""Did You Hear About The Morgans"" is a cute movie but very predictable. No chemistry whatsoever between Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker. Sam Elliott and Mary Steenberger have smaller parts but they are the best thing about this movie. Both are superb actors and don't ""overact"" or ""overdramatize"" their parts. It is just another cookie cutter type romantic comedy. Not groundbreaking, but entertaining enough."
1,"No Chemistry, No Laughs","Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker fail to click in yet another glorified sitcom from the Hollywood assembly line. Regardless of screen ratio, ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" (2009) is a dire experience. The studios no longer care about quality product. For once, moviegoers responded in kind."
3,"A ""really sappy movie"" ...","... with about six thigh-slappingly funny lines. If you like ""really sappy love stories"" with just a soupon of menace, here it is for you. Hugh Grant is insufferably fey, Sarah J Sexinthecity is simply insufferable, and the grizzly bear can't act.But there's one scene where Hugh 'n Sarah go out on a 'date' -- Hugh's ploy for reconciliation -- at the only cafe in Ray, Wyoming, which happens also to be the general store and trading post. They sit down at the oil-clothed table beside the grocery shelves, and Hugh says, ""I called ahead to make reservations by the mayonnaise jars."" Yee-haw! Broke me up!"
5,Great Romantic Comedy,"I laughed, I cried, I loved this movie!! If you love '2 Weeks Notice' you'll love 'Did You Hear About The Morgans?'"
3,Cute but not very funny,Cute. Too long and unrealistic. Don't feel the need to own this one. Acting is only okay and seems forced. Humor is more miss than hit. Mature subject matter obviously not for kids.
4,Did You Hear About The Morgans,"I thought it was a very good movies. I liked it. It was funny and made you laugh. Sarah Jessica Parker was funny. I saw the movie the first time on TV, but got in on the last part, so I missed the begining. I decided it was worth buying, so I ordered it. It was good entertainment. All the people in it was very good. They all made you laugh. It is a good movie to watch if you just want a good laugh."
1,Pixalization of DVD,"I purchased this DVD in March 2010 for a present to a member of my family who lives a few hundred miles from me and they bought the DVD back to me : Reason, the DVD was poorly burnt, it pixalized then stopped and it kept doing it all the time. I don't know if any body else has had a problem with it but definately don't recommend it to be purchase it because if it has happened to mine it most surely will occur in other DVD's."
2,Too slow,"Although I enjoy both the lead actors in this movie, for me it was a little too slow, not enough excitment or realism. I know it is merely entertainment but......"
3,didn't even film it in Wyoming.,"Boooo,I really hate when they say something is in a certain location,but its not. (like The Proposal being in Sitka and they filmed it in Mass.) This flick could have been filmed in Wyoming with little problem,(The town of LaBarge comes to mind),but they used sites in New Mexico instead. this, added to the medeocre acting of the 2 main stars was sad. It was saved a bit with the GOOD acting of Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen. and Bart the bear. So my opinion is, enjoy what there is, but not really a keeper title. I would rather enjoy Hugh with Sandra Bullock in ""Two Weeks Notice"" or Hugh and Julia in ""Notting Hill"" He was also decent in ""Four Weddings"" which is another one with a loser of a leading lady/love interest,but has a super supporting cast...."
1,This could have been funny...,"The trailers are funny, thats all. If I want a message about eating the wrong ""greasy heart stopping food"" I will rent supersize. If I want to learn more about anti-gun laws I will listen to critics of NRA. Geez give me a break, BORING; I can't imagine why Hugh Grant even agreed to this part. Yuck. I wasted the rental fee. I'd rather watch Fargo, it has humor in it."
5,Nothing NOT to Like,"While it likely won't go down as the greatest movie of all time, there's really nothing NOT to like about this movie. I've always enjoyed the comedic talents of Hugh Grant, and have never seen a movie with Sarah Jessica Parker that I didn't enjoy."
4,Was very entertaining,My son and I watched this movie and we both enjoyed it very much. We found it very entertaining and thought that the acting was very good. We both love Sam Elliott and really enjoyed seeing him again. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes the cast because they all did a great job. I am going to purchase it also because it is one that I would enjoy watching many times.
2,Why oh why didn't I read the reviews?,Everything other reviewers was true. It is not a bad movie but it isn't good either.
3,The Morgan's don't have that much to say.,"Did you hear about the Morgans? After watching it I would have to say there is very little in the movie to say about the Morgans. I really wanted to love this film. SJP, Hugh and a romantic comedy (my favourite style of movie) but I was very disappointed. No real storyline to talk about, performances below par, about 90 minutes of my time that I will not be getting back. If you are thinking about purchasing the DVD save your money."
5,FUNNY MOVIE LOTS OF LAUGHS,I live in Wyoming so I guessed from previews I'd seen on TV that our simple way of life could be made funny by city-folk. My husband and I laughed all through this movie. I'm very glad I bought this movie.
3,I wanted to like it but couldn't bring myself to...,"A very predictable story, weak dialogue, and poor pacing. I liked the premise, the cast, and the music, but this was a waste of time. Still, it was a good way to test dowloading a high-definition rental to my TiVo. I just wished the film worked as well as the technology..."
1,"""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" has no chemistry whatsoever, they really HATE each other!","Length:: 5:46 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"", written and directed by Marc Lawrence and starring Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker.[...]"
2,Don't believe the hype,"Maybe it's just me, but the unfocused playing and vocals just didn't do it. I tried listening to it many times and just gave up. I ended up selling it to a used CD store down the street. The people behind the counter pretty much agreed with my asessment; playing like you really can't play doesn't make for a great listening expereince."
4,Pavement at their near best,"I enjoy pavement. Reviewing music is difficult due to the fact that liking music revolves around personal taste. That being said, if you are a fan of pavement, this cd is for you. I enjoy the vocals, melodies, and lyrics of this album. This is my 2nd favorite album by the group, and if you don't own it and are considering purchasing it, GO FOR IT, YOU WON'T BE LET DOWN."
3,i must disagree with most of the reviews here.,"There are waaaay better Pavement records out there. ""Slanted and Enchanted"" is worlds better. ""Watery Domestic"" has probably the 4 best Pavement songs ever written on it. Crooked Rain has a different drummer and a production quality that screams ""MAINSTREAM"". Thank god they ditched this sound and went back to their roots on ""Wowee Zowee"" or i would not be a Pavement fan today. Look for this one in the used bin at your local cd shop."
5,my favorite pavement album,"if you are only going to own one pavement album, make it this one. i have been listening to this album non stop since it came out and i am still not tired of it. sometimes i find other pavement albums too ambient and sluggish, even though i am quite the noise fan and anymore pavement is not really so lo-fi... ANYWAY this album has enough of a pop sensibility to strike love in the hearts of modern FM rockers but enough indie cred to still be good after six or so years...i store this one on my ""classic"" record shelf."
5,A dilectible meal for the discerning music eater,"With Pavement, it's really hard to say which album is 'their best', but this one stands out to me as the most tasty from start to finish. Basically, pavement is the plateau rock music reaches when genuine creativity takes the somewhat sleepy state of standard rock song writing outside the box of pop music, making it something genuinely interesting, emotional, hilarious, and quitre often, perplexing. These guys are the biggest musical pranksters that ever needed to be taken seriously. If you are a seasoned music lover, you will almost certainly appreciate this album at some level. Serve warm."
3,Just above average....,"Freedom Call is a power metal band from Germany that have been together since the late 90's. Their music is in the vein of Gamma Ray, early Angra, and Stratovarius. Freedom Call's latest offering, The Circle of Life, doesn't break any new ground, but still stay's consistent. It seems to me that the band has scaled back on speed, and have created more of a moderate, heavy sound. With that being said, the music starts to sound the same after a while! In addition, the music sounds like it was a little rushed in the process. This could be that most, if not all of the band members are involved in other projects. If you like a straight forward, metal sound, then The Circle of Life won't disappoint. If you're hoping that Freedom Call has moved forward some with their sound, then you're going to be let down as I am!"
5,Sublime and Imaginative,"I loved this CD. I am a long time fan of NSS and I enjoyed all the vocal and instrumental perfomances, both as a classical musician, and as a Christmas music enthusiast. The arrangements and orchestration were imaginative and unique. Nadja's beautiful, strong tone is unmatched, and it's fun the way she seemingly casually and effortlessly throws in virtuosic improv-like elements. This was a thoughtfully and creatively developed album with superb performances all around, in a variety of styles. Very enjoyable! I wanted to listen it to again and again immediately upon the 1st listening."
1,Not One of Nadja's Brighter Moments,"Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg has always been one of my favorite violinists and favorite musicians. I've heard her in at least 6 live concerts and they were all fantastic - she has a lot to offer the world of music.However, this disc is extremely annoying. Now, Nadja has always had tons of musical spunk, and she has made it work well interpretively for big concertos and sonatas and other showpieces. But it simply does not work here. ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" with tons of glissandi and other various centuries-old carols with 'nouveau' jazz effects just isn't appealing. The vocal soloists on a couple of the tracks are pretty bad too. Anyhow, I highly recommend Nadja's other recordings. Not this one, though. I am pretty sure she did this disc for the purpose of holiday party music. But there are tons of other better Xmas party music discs out there by big artists."
1,Very disappointing,"I loved Nadia's playing in other performances, but her violin sounded shrill and the jazzed up or nouveau renditions of Christmas songs did not work. ""Merry"" was very disappointing, and went into the trash the same afternoon."
5,Good value & quality,"I received these blade very quickly - as always. The blades are made from a good quality steel and come in an easy dispenser/organizer. They were not rusty and have a very sharp edge. They can be sharpened easily and retain the edge throughout some tough jobs. The cost could be a little better, but the old expression ""you get what you pay for"" applies here. They last much longer than the generic brands and don't break as easily. One thing I've found out is - if I apply a lite coat of Vaseline on the blades they don't rust even when left outside for an extended period of time (not in the rain). Overall, I'm very pleased with this product and will buy them again when needed."
4,Privy good,"I have not had one blow apart on me yet, they do what they should, last for a good bit.nice for the. Money."
1,These fall off easily,"These drumbs do not stay on the roller at all. It might have been the roller, but they seemed to be a bit loose when used with a peachtree roller set."
1,drum sander,"I put this sander in my rotary grinder and the first thing it did was bend the soft shaft and smack my hand several times. Out of balance is something I can deal with, but this shaft is too soft and is dangerous."
5,Pick-me-up music,Good positive rap music without the negative and evil lyrics. I've always liked the Hammer. I drive a truck and it's one of my 'pick-me-up' cds.
3,Not a complete dvd of his work,I bought this DVD thinking that it is going to be so cool to watch Mike Macdonalds old Showtime special As Happy As I can Be and find out after I paid a heavy 18 dollars for this video to find out the 60 minute special was cut to 37 minutes for this dvd release. I am trying to contact the people who put this on dvd to find out what is the deal. It is still a good dvd but not worth the money they are asking for it seeing the only real reason I bought it is to see his special as happy as I can be.
2,broken and no way to get a replacement,"Some of these arrived broken and chipped and there is no way to ask for a simple replacement. You have to do a lot of paperwork and return a bunch of glass chunks.Why can't a simple photo suffice? Who knows, but if you get these, just beware that about 1 glass per packet might be broken."
3,A biased book,"Mr Krohnen saw what he wanted to see. The problem is what he did not tell.What Mr Krohnen says is something as the official view of the foundations and schools. The book makes one doubt that Krishnamurti was ever capable of making himself understood. As far as I know, nobody around Krishnamurti became independent of Krishnamurti. Krishnamurti often said that he would never repeat anything that he did not discover by himself. The schools never produced anything but people conditioned by the teachings. I have known these people for more than 35 years. If I have to judge by them, Krishnamurti's teachings were a waste of time.On the other hand, the book gives a good view of the atmosphere around this unique person, J. Krishnamurti."
3,Interesting analysis of the 1960s,"Farrell uses personalism to make sense of the 1960s. He describes the Catholic Workers, Beats, Student Movement, Counterculture, Anti-War movement, among others, as organizations rooted in the belief of personalism. Unfortunately his analysis is lacking in relation to women, since the womens's movement would greatly undermine his argument. Except for a small section in the back women are rarely mentioned. The fact that women organized due to the discrimination and subordination they felt within these movements as well as from society as a whole shows that their belief in the importance of the individual as well as group was selective. This fact puts some major holes in the arguement. Overall the book in enthralling, whether or not you agree with what he's saying it is a completely new way to look at the 1960s."
5,you can't beat a white mountain puzzle,this has to be one of my all time favorite puzzles to assemble. it brings back fond memories as you are assembling it.
5,Great Meditation CD,"The Inner Smile is a marvelous collection of guided meditations. When I have a headache, I can diminish or even erase the pain by following this CD. She takes you through gentle yoga stretches for the neck and shoulders that help release tension. The CD also includes breathing techniques and deep relaxation. It's a simple and pleasant way to relieve stress. She has a comforting voice and the music is quiet and relaxing."
5,This has really helped my 87 yr old Father,"My father has Dimentia and this has really made his life a little easier. He was so confused about when to take his pills, how many, etc. This eliminated the problem all together. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has to take pills on a daily basis."
5,Best Gift Ever!,"My daughter who is 21 months recieved the Little People Preschool for Christmas. She absolutely LOVES this toy & it's already taught her how to say certain numbers, colors and shapes. It is a must have for every child and is very educational & ADORABLE. I will certainly be buying this for other children when birthday's roll around or holiday's. It's very inexpensive & my daughter would rather play with it verses her $50+ toys."
2,"Cute, but not fun or educational","My son received this toy for his third birthday. I was excited because while he can count, he doesn't yet connect quantities with a numeral.However, this toy takes up a lot of space but he doesn't ever play with it. Occasionally my one year old will pull out all of the pieces (playground equipment, easel and ten little people) and leave them all over the living room. The problem with the toy is that all of the feature are very one dimensional. You can do one thing with each of the four pieces, so there is no room for imagination.But neither child enjoys playing with it, so the chances of it having educational value are low.Big points for not having annoying flashing lights and keeping the annoying noises to a minimum, though!"
1,doesn't allow for much imagination,"I am sick and tired of ALL the toys out there having to have sounds and some sort of ""educational"" purpose. Kids this age don't learn from a TOY. They don't care that the toy asked them to find the red star. My son like virtually all little kids just hits the buttons over and over. Kids learn from mom and dad. Unfortunetly my mother got this toy from my son's 3rd birthday. Since it was from grandma I can't ditch it. Grandparents never do listen when you tell them what you want for your kids. I have locked it away in a plastic prison box and will only remove it when I HAVE to."
3,Little People Time to Learn Review,"We bought this as a birthday gift for a 2 year old. The concept is fine, but the way the toy is laid out, makes it hard to use as a teaching tool. it is too easy to activate the different ""sounds"" while in the process of doing something else. For example, you may be playing with the numbers but if the child touches the play mat, it will talk about colors. Children who like to play with the ""Little People"" figures would probably enjoy this toy as it comes with several."
4,Time for school,"Great toy for introducing social skills children will need when entering preschool. Toddlers can learn to take turns by having Little People wait for turns on the slide. Learn about school activities... Painting and music. Not to mention the overt instruction in colors, counting, and shapes. Great toy for the 2-4 age group. Toy could improve with a wider range of songs, but overall, a wonderful toy to mix learning and playing for your child."
5,Another hit with Little People,I Love Little People and this toy is no exception. My son has this and loves it just as much as his other Little People products. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product. You get a lot for your money.
4,Cute and educational....,My two year old likes this toy as it teaches her numbers and colors. She has no interest in the little people and they stay in the storage compartment in the back. This was a good purchase for her.
5,Barb's review of Fisher Price Little People Time to Learn Preschool,"I bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday, I think it is a really cute toy. Very Eduational, my daughter really seems to enjoy it."
5,Little People Preschool,"My daughter loves to play teacher, and she loves Little People, so this toy hit the mark with her - her favorite Christmas present!"
5,Additional information...,"I love the original Hemp Masters book, I've been referring to it for years now. When I saw there was a second book out I was a little hesitant after reading the other reviews. There is a lot of the same information in the second book as you can find in the first. This book has all new designs though, most of which involve adding color. Up until now most of my pieces have been one color throughout. It was nice to be able to look over this book to help add a little color here and there. So, although a lot of the information will be found in the first, there is plenty of new information to make this a worthwhile purchase!"
4,Hemp Masters: Getting Knotty,"I love macrame, but all my books are from the 70's for plant hangers and hanging tables, etc. I'm excited to try something on a much smaller scale. I happy to have found this book!"
4,A fine finish,"A wonderful mystery setting (New Zealand house party, cut off from the outside world) in one of Marsh's wittiest, best-written books (at the age of 85!). Ending was a bit disappointing, but otherwise wonderful. Her penultimate book, better than her last, Light Thickens."
4,A couple of rare gems for ardent fans and collectors,"It is interesting to hear undubbed versions of some classic tracks as well as some previously-unheard and alternate versions. This instrumental rock group is not to be confused with the other ""blues"" group with raunchy album titles."
3,Good Leadership Principles,"I thought the book was good, although simplistic (which is probably best). I didn't think this was the best material that Kouzes and Posner have ever published, but the principles espoused are solid."
3,150 Ways to Encourage The Heart,"I felt that this book by Kouzes and Posner presented wonderful ideas for leaders. It seemed more directed towards managers of organizations than leaders in general. I was very impressed with the seven essential steps that were offered. It opened up a whole new avenue for putting your heart into a job. I do feel that this book could have been titled, ""150 Ways to Encourage the Heart."" This book seemed completely repetitive in the last chapter and could have cut down the 11 chapters before it. However this book did offer wonderful ideas for caring leaders and I would recommend it."
2,so far disappointing,"The book is not well written. The author does not clearly explain her thinking, she hops from topic to topic without connecting the ideas behind the topics, and always assumes that the reader has some working knowledge on the matter she is writing about.That is not to say that the book cannot be useful. The author has some good points on why technical analysis can work, but it is a petty that more often than not her message does not come across."
1,Too much talking,"I read about half of the book, the author keeps talking about how great technical analysis is, and how she is one of the experts on that. She shows some examples but I don't feel I got anything out of them. I understand what she tries to find, but she doesn't explain well how she finds it. I am not going to waste any more of my time on this book, the author probably is very experienced on the subject, but not a good writer/presented."
1,Out of Context Aimless meandering,"The author has her heart in the right place. She even starts out trying to go step-by-step, but it does not last. Somewhere into the 3rd or 4th page she starts utilizing advanced jargon to explain her elementary concepts. She never makes any reference to the 'advanced jargon' before this. That means that she does not build brick-by-brick.Also, her references to various charts is confusing and mixed up. In one chapter where she introduces charting a stock on the monthly, weekly and quarterly charts, she makes conflicting points and ...well...let me not waste more time. Her language use is not good, therefore, her communication methods leave a person hanging.Just DO NOT buy this book. There are other better books out there. Such as Toni Turner's books.However, let me just say that she does explain some other overlying economic concepts and global mechanics of wealth building warriors, sitting around the world, very well."
3,lively conversation,"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. It was very well written, and it filled in a few holes in my education. However, I did not learn very much new about technical analysis. For a begginer, however I think that this book would provide a wealth of information."
1,Data feed has been discontinued,"Don't get me wrong with the one-star review -- these were great in their day! But Ambient Devices hasn't sold them in years, and the data feed that these rely on was discontinued more than a year ago. It's an expensive paperweight, unless you have some mean hacking chops to open it up and reprogram it."
5,SEAMLESS AND TIMELESS,"This has to be one of the most seamless recordings of rock n roll ever. It is still fascinating to hear how Bill Nelson weaves his Hendrix-esque Uzi guitar licks into these quirky off-camber pop tunes. In terms of lyrical content, songs like ""Blazing Apostles,"" and ""Life in the Air Age"" still stand out for their intelligence and humor. This is a band that never got the recognition; perhaps a bit too cerebral for their time, they are unfortunately but a footnote to less creative contemporaries."
4,Gone But Not Forgotten,"One of the essential touchstones of 70s rock guitar, Bill Nelson's playing is hectically eclectic, scorchingly overdriven, and transcendentally melodic. Imagine Carlos Santana sitting in with Queen, maybe."
2,Weird,"I bought this because I had a cassette of Bill Nelson in the 80's that I really loved. I was looking for something else of his and came across this.I think I would have liked this in 1976; it would have slid in nicely between Queen and Pink Floyd. It probably would have gotten played more. Even today I can still appreciate it as sort of a historical document. But I don't think I will listen to it very much. A lot of the songs sound like they are two songs pasted together. The rhythms, beats and melodies often sound disjointed and discontinuous. It is very dated. I respect Nelson's work, but it doesn't appeal to me today.Also, I don't usually notice, let alone complain about this, but the sound quality is horrible. Sounds like it was originally mastered on an 8-track."
4,Hits the spot,"Yes, they are a bit oily and salty -- but it satisfies that desire for greasy/salty edibles!What's good is the quantity -- very satisfying as a single portion (instead of the package suggestion of 3) -- but keeps me and mine from eating half a can."
3,Same as rx5915,"Well this is really strange. This is exactly the same device as the iPaq rx5915, which Amazon also sells, but for about $100 cheaper at the time I write this. The last number in HP model numbers indicates the sales channel so the 5910 might be the retail store box and the 5915 might be the online box, or vice versa, etc. So if you're interested in this item, search for the rx5915 right here on Amazon and save yourself some money. Verify this on the HP web site before you lay down your cash, but I'm pretty certain this is true.As to the device itself, it's pretty good but suffers from the same issue that all converged devices do. As a Pocket PC, it's not quite as good as a dedicated PPC such as my aging iPaq 2215 (though those are getting harder to find), and as a GPS navigation system, it's not quite as good as a dedicated system such as my Magellan Roadmate 760. But it's basically solid on both counts and, if you need both, you'll probably be happy with it."
2,annoying and useless as GPS,"The idea is great: in my case, rather than lug a buch of guidebooks around Rome, I would simply enter various points of interest, restaurants, etc. into the device, then wander around. If I felt like stopping, I could check the device to see what was around that was interesting, or find my way somewhere.However, the thing takes so long to get a fix, loses its signal so easily, and is so brain dead about what direction you are heading, I darn near threw it into the Tiber, where it belongs. The TomTom software (Navigator 6) is unstable and not as well thought out as Garmin's. And, yes, I have the latest updates, which offer a slight improvement.The Pocket PC part of the device is unremarkable."
4,Almost a great comeback album.,"Though this album wouldnt stand up to ""Big Plans For Everbody"", it still has the playful elements going on that made Let's Active ""active"". The cd starts out slow in my opinion until the 7th track, only then did I feel it was gaining any traction. the last 5 tracks rank right up there with the best of what he's done. ""Glazed"" being my favorite."
4,Mitch Never Left,"This a perfect link between the Mitch Easter of Let's Active days and the Mitch who plays multi-instrumentalist and contributing songwriter in the excellent power pop band Shalini. Equal parts jangle rock, metal-edged power pop, and subdued prog rock, the record flows with ease and grace. There are three or four standout tracks, but there's nothing you'd call filler. Easter is a guitar wizard who never seems to feel the need to play showy ""licks,"" choosing instead to employ his gift by pulling off subtle hooks and playful rhythms. The lyrics are enjoyably tongue-in-cheek, and while Easter has never been a great singer, he's good enough at it to deliver the songs fittingly. If you're a Let's Active fan who wasn't aware that Mitch Easter is still a performing musician, you will welcome this new set of songs gleefully. And if you like this, pick up the last album by Shalini, which is one of the great recent pop records that noboby ever talks about."
5,Every home should have a copy of this cookbook!,"Fresh Choices has quickly become one of my favorite cookbooks. It's a great blend of delicious recipies and important information to know as the grocery shopper and primary cook for my family. I've learned a lot about which fruits and vegetables have the least pesticide residues and how to choose meats and seafood that are low in toxins. The easy to follow, yet delicious recipies have been a big hit at my dinner table and I am confident I am making more healthful choices for my family at the grocery store. Every home should have a copy of this cookbook!"
5,Radar Gun Works Great,Works great on baseballs & softballs. I used the digital speedometer in my car as a test of the gun's accuracy. The gun and my car always agreed to within 1 MPH. The case appears to be very durable - the front end of the gun is rubber armored. I am perfectly satisfied.Be sure to read the instructions to avoid erroneous readings.
5,works on sports cars,"The unit was used at Road Atlanta race track and performed as advertised. The unit can give erroneous readings when multiple cars are bunched together and moving at different speeds, however, this isn't fault of the unit. The only other downside is that to obtain accurate speeds the car needs to be moving nearly directly towards you or away from you not when the car crossing directly in front of you. Again not the fault of the unit just the nature of how Doppler radar works. The unit works best when you have a clear view to a car approaching or going away such as down a long straight away."
2,not accurate,"I bought this to speed test daughters fastpitch softball pitching speeds. She tested on a several juggs guns at 57 mph, the best this gun would read is 52-53. Tried 4 other pitchers,,all pitched in high 55-60mph range on juggs,,this gun gave everyone(4)pitchers the same speed of 53?? Go figure"
1,Horrible Reading Distance,"I bought this gun and am not able to use it at any games. I am not able to pick up any readings, even sitting directly behind the backstop. I have tried about 15 different parks traveling with my team. This has been a horrible experiment. If your sitting more than 8-10 feet behind catcher,as at most parks, this gun is useless. Don't make the same mistake."
3,good for price,it was a little in accurate for lacrosse but it was good for the price overall i think it was pretty good
4,Works as advertised,"Appears to accurately measure velocity of baseballs, softballs, even wiffle balls. It helped me teach my kids that 50 mph vehicle + 50 mph vehicle = 100 mph impact. This radar gun is accurate only when the object being measured is on a direct collision course with the gun, but that's what I expected. So don't sit on the third base line at a baseball game and complain that your son's pitches are being clocked too slowly. Go back to physics class and recall vectors. I awarded only four stars because, with only 3 weeks of use, I'm not sure of the radar gun's durability. As long as this product stays durable, I'm happy with it."
4,Great Tool,"I used this speed gun for some research I did where I needed vehicle speeds. While this model is probably not accurate enough to give you the exact speed for a vehicle among a number of vehicles, it worked well for my needs. It is pretty easy to use, the batteries last a long time even with heavy use (replaced about once a week with nearly all day use every day). It is not too big and bulky and can fit into a small backpack quite easily. It is easy to switch between MPH and KPH."
1,"do not buy,,,,","could not pick up a car heading straigh on,,, on a small plane from 200' or a baseball,,,sent the unit in to be fixed,, bot billed for fixing it,,, still doesn't work,,,,do not buy this product. I ended up using a hotwheels radar gun for $20..."
1,Laser Gun Not as it seems,It got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it (a month or so later) it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly. A huge disappointment and waste of my money.
3,three for a reason,"i'm rating this a three as i have not yet used it. i suspect it will work perfectly, but i'm not certain. i do like the simplicity of the design, and my intent is to track the speeds in my condo complex."
2,"Electronics good, poor mechanical design for battery enclosure","Pros:-Works well for tennis balls.Cons:-One of two snaps on the handle used to secure the battery enclosure broke during the initial battery installation. Ours is now secured with tape.Recommendations:-Take extra care when removing the battery housing to not overstress the snaps.-Check the return policy of your vendor before your purchase... my vendor (purchased through Amazon) had a 15% restocking fee, would not refund shipping and would not pay for return shipping."
5,Excatly what I was looking for at the right price,"Excatly what I was looking for at the right price, and shipping was very fast."
4,Strapless,It has no strap and no way to easily attach one! Wouldn't that be a no brainer? It seems to be working so far but the security provided by a harness would be very helpful on a hot sweaty day.
5,what a blast ive had,"right out of the box,, drop in battaries,and off you go.no issues or noproblems.we have had problems with speeders on our business rd for a while,so just to see how bad it was,i decided to test it out. lot of 60's and even up to a 73 mph in a 40mph speedzone..but those that had there radar detectors on were slowing down big time and breakin there knecks lookin round for a cop,, it was hillarious,,and then we decided to clock some of my rc cars,, it was a blast playing with this thing.no problems useing or reading it,, functioned great."
4,Well worth it,Got it for my 9u travel team. It works well. Great price. Gives me a gauge on different pitchers and their pitches. Easy to operate. I find it accurate enough for this age application. Kids are throwing in the 45-55 mph range.
5,Works well,Good tool to have for its designed purpose. Easy to use and read the results. Just a little too costly.
5,BUSHNELL SPEED GUN,It was so cool! That was very accurate and I use this for pitching baseballs. I think you should buy it!
3,Bottom Basement Radar,"The Bushnell radar gun is a low end radar. OK for casual use for softball games and clocking cars, but with low sensitivity and questionable accuracy. I bought mine to gauge the speed of radio control gliders, but unless the glider flew straight at the radar and uncomfortably close, it wouldn't get a reading, so I sold mine to someone else."
2,Gun speed,This gun if fine. Vary hard to get a good reading on the ball as it comes to the plate. I would say 4 out of 10 times it will pick up the speed of the ball. I would recommend spending $100-$200 more if you want to not bother with taking reading after reading.
2,High price for a so-so product,"I broke out the radar gun to check out my son's pitching speed. Out of 20 tries, I got one reading that was even close to accurate. He was recently clocked at 80 mph on a reliable Juggs gun, but the best I could get from this product was one reading of 73 mph. Now, even if he did throw it 73, why was I getting readings anywhere from 11 to 23 mph on the other 19? Operator error? Sure, but why isit so difficult to get the reading? It was a breeze on the Juggs gun.In sum, highly inaccurate, difficult to get readings consistently (ANY kind of readings!), and a major disappointment."
1,broken,"Received the Bushnell Velocity Speed gun, put in the battery and the unit turned on, but did not pick up a car heading straight on speed nor any speed at all. Also, There is no manual instruction. I am in the process of returning the product, does anyone know what is their refund/process policy/reputation lately?"
2,Disappointed,"The product description states the speed gun measures ""Auto racing range: 6 to 200 mph (1,500 feet away)."" On the package the speed range is clearly defined as 10-200 MPH. I purchased this product to help enforce safe speed limits on our job site. Because the product doesn't begin measuring speed until 10 MPH, it is useless on our 5 MPH site."
5,Yay! It Works!!!!!,"This is the best thing that will ever happen to your dog(s)! My husband and I bought this for my two dogs Zoey and Charlie. It was a great fit...the dogs didn't mind having it on them. Plus it's cute! When the dogs went swimming in the lake they floated, and when it was time go...real simple just pull them right out...they stayed in it and were comfortable! GREAT FIND AND GREAT BUY!!!!!!!"
5,vest,"Worked great. When my puppy went overboard off of my kayak, I was able to easily grab the strap and get him back onboard."
4,"Good product, a little bulky for my dog","I ordered this life jacket for my 32 lb lab mix, Charlie. He is small framed, long and lean. I ordered a medium for him, and when it arrived, I found it to be a little bigger and bulkier than I was expecting. I tightened the straps as tight as they could go around his belly, and had to overlap them around his neck. But once we got to the lake, it did the job just fine and stayed on when he was in the water. It is a very cute jacket and gets the job done, but tends to run a little big."
3,"Deceptive photo, not a great fit","My primary concern is that the neck of this jacket doesn't fit my dog well, but the next size up is too big. The neck adjusts, but the jacket just isn't built well for a dachshund.Also, Paws Aboard has changed the look of its jackets, plastering its not-small logo on both sides of the jacket, not just on the top, as shown in this photo. It's unfortunate, because it makes your dog look a like a little walking billboard.I had great hopes for this jacket, but even if the neck fit, I probably would have sent it back, because having the logo plastered on both sides makes it look cheap/tacky."
4,Watch the size but really cute life jacket,"My young male chihuahua mix weighs JUST OVER 6 lbs so I thought I would get the XS (rated 7-15lbs) just in case he gains weight as he ages.What I didn't think of was the size of the garment UNDERNEATH... it really was down too close to his boy-parts for either one of us to be really happy with the fit.I am exchanging it for the XXS size after all, which is rated for 0-6 LBS... it is described as 2 inches shorter in overall length.The boy-parts will be un-chafed! YAHOO!So we have not really tested the item in the water yet, but I DID some reading of other reviews before I ordered, and I can see the good construction of the XS jacket currently in my hands. I think we'll have a winner, and if NOT I will get back on here and write some more... :-)"
3,too small,This would be great if it were not too small. It hardly fits around his neck. The charts are wrong.
1,Never received credit for return,This place NEVER credited me when I sent it back because of size. What is the deal with this company??!!
1,Dvorak In America,"Mr. Horowitz, the author, gives us scant information about Dvorak's stay in this country. Most of this I had read before in other books. The author seems to make a case that Dvorak used Black or Native American themes in his works and that theory is very questionable. I would like to know how Dvorak worked: Did he make sketches in four-part harmony, did he write directly to manuscript paper. Was the 9th Symphony completely orchestrated when he left New York in June, 1893, or did he do the orchestration in Spillville, Iowa that summer? And, of course, the author continously uses a false title for the 9th Symphony, which I find very annoying...THE NEW WORLD SYMPHONY is not the title that Dvorak gave it. It was titled,""From The New World"" and that alone should be used.Most of this book is wasted effort.Jack Nelson3940 Park Blvd. #703San Diego, CA 92103"
3,"A Spenser Wanna-be, but still worth it","In this novel (Dennis Lehane's first work involving the detectives Patrick Kenzie and ANgela Gennaro,) Lehane tries very hard to write in the style made famous by Robert B. Parker, and his character Spenser. A Drink Before the War isn't bad, but to anyone the least bit familiar with Spenser, the similarities are obvious. The protagonist's sarcasm, the book's setting, the attractive co-lead character, all of them just scream SPENSER at the top of their lungs. The only thing missing is a bit of Spenser's charm and originality. I read A Drink Before The War on an airplane, and found it quite entertaining, but for the serious connosueir of detective literature, I advise you to look elsewhere."
3,Look for something else,"Although Patrick Kenzie is a very well drawn character, the story does not match in quality his virtues, as this book far from being a well crafted mystery novel, is an attempt that falls short from the making of something appealing. I question the simplicity of the plot, its permanent dull pace set from the very beginning and also the impossibility to elaborate the mystery into something more complex and interesting. This book is not gripping !!!"
2,Lehane uses all the 1950's clichés of Private Eyes.,"It was boring from the start. Lehane uses all the 1950's clichés of Private Eyes. It was like reading a summary of the 1950 television TV shows. A PI who has a great looking secretary (he changed it to partner). The bad guys are obviously bad guys and the good guys are 'Gosh, we are fair, but powerful! (qoutes are mine). Everything in this was predictable. I gave it 2 stars because I laughed a couple of times."
1,Yawn.,"What's the hype about this book? It has a pretty thin plot, not especially interesting characters, and the writing style is fairly dull. If I weren't stuck on a transcontinental plane ride, I don't think I would have bothered to read it through."
1,I shake my head...,"as I try to understand what all the rave reviews are about this book. I literally had to force myself to read it thinking I must be missing something or that that something will come along eventually and make me say, ""Great book, great story!!"" NOT!! I found this story to be very non-engaging and no where near the page turner I thought it was going to be. I was glad when it was over but then am forcing myself to read another Lehane book just to make sure I'm not being over reactive. I did not enjoy this book, or the writing, the characters were annoying. Oh well... I guess I can give it one star for effort."
4,A great start to the series,"""A Drink Before the War"" is the first of Lehane's Kenzie/Gennaro detective stories. It's interesting and involving - especially in the set up of the main characters. Lehane is able to give insight into both without bogging down the story - interestingly, it all relates with each other, which makes the storyline more involving. The book deals heavily with race relations, but in an honest way - you can tell he is writing ""real"" characters, instead of preaching his point through them in an unrealistic way. A good read - definitely recommended."
3,Frustrating amalgam of good writing and implausible plotting,"I've read other newer works by Lehane and liked them very much. I came acrossthis in a book store and decided to give it a shot. The writing is very good but some of the plot details come across as hyperbole. Comedian Bill Burr has a few good riffs about how stupid movies are where the racist guy just openly says insanely bigoted things. Burr makes the point that even people with stupid conceptions of the world like that are more sophisticated in how and where they express them. Not in this book.In his later works, Lehane clearly sees that there's nothing wrong with a modest scope to the goings on of a book but seems to make a sort of rookie mistake here in veering into hyperbole. Examples include the Bubba character and the depiction of gang members."
5,Lehane is at his best with these two characters,"There is something about the chemistry - not easy on the printed page - between these two. And unlike other books, I don't see the faces or inflections of the actors who have played these roles. Lahane's prose and plot are powerful enough to work on their own. And of course, he seems to know Boston well - a town I don't know very well at all."
3,"Okay, but lacks realism to some degree","I don't buy some of the characters, and I don't believe some choices made by these.But he writes with a rough pen and speaks in a way which I can thoroughly enjoy."
5,"Mr Lehane, Don't screw this up!","As I read this wonderful Boston PI story, one thought kept coming to mind. This series could go bad real fast. Searching for a politician's maid puts Pat Kenzie and Angela Gennaro in the line of fire of a deadly gang war. Great story-wonderful characters-but this whole thing could go rotten. Mr. Lehane, please please please DO NOT make Pat and Angie a romantic couple. THe characters are just fine, but nothing ruins a series like that cheap TV sitcom sweeps stunt where 2 characters who had a definite tension, finally find the wherewithal to forge ahead with a romantic relationship (even worse when it graduates to marriage and a baby carriage). Mr. Lehane, I love these characters. Don't ruin 'em!"
4,Full of Suspense!,"This is the first novel I have read by Lehane, but it will definitely not be the last. I could not put this book down! The plot is great and so are the characters! One of the best mystery/suspene books that I have read in a long time and I would suggest it to anyone in the mood for a great novel that is full of suspense."
5,"A stunning book about politics, pushers, and agenda.","Having been a social worker in Boston, working with inner city offenders and gang members I can attest that Mr. Lehane writes a gripping truth which would shock many readers.""A Drink"" is tough, charming, emotional, outrageous novel which is loaded with truth."
4,Great read......Great Story,"I must say that I enjoyed how Lehane made his characters so down to earth. That is what made that book. The plot is soild and with the colorful characters it adds such an outstanding twist to the book. I felt as if I could have sat down with Patrick Kenzie and had a beer..lol.Kenzie and his partner Angela Gennaro are private investators, hired by a senator to find a cleaning woman. Lehane did a masterful job in adding new drama and a by adding a sexual tension between Kenzie and Gennaro(whom herself has her own problems). I am looking forward to reading more from these to, Enjoy."
2,not good,"If I had read Lehanes's books in the order that they were written, I would never have continued beyond this first effort. His stories never tap dance around the darkness and decay that is increasingly closer to the surface of civility but this was too bleak to recommend to anyone. While it is true that every person is capable of both great goodness and great evil, life is cheap and violence the way of much of the world, this seemed too far over the edge for even a cynical realist like myself."
3,Just okay,"I thought this book was just okay. A little too preachy for me. I kept wanting the two protagonists to get together. But maybe I'm too much of a romantic. I usually wait and read the second book before I bring criticism, and I will read the second one to see if it improves, but right now I'm not a big fan."
1,Awful!,"I hate be the lone dissenter here, but I honestly hated this book and cannot figure out why it is so highly praised. The storyline is boring, the characters are one-dimensional, unrealistic and annoying, and the violence in this book is overwhelming. Gruesome shootings and beatings occur at regular intervals, and one particularly awful torture scene is enough to turn one's stomach. It seems like the author, instead of wanting to write a decent story with realistic and engaging dialogue, instead decided that it would be much easier to simply pen scenes where everyone gets blown to smithereens, while our heroic duo emerge with barely a scratch. And yes, I do realize the book centers around gang warfare, but all the guns, snipers and grenades seemed a bit much a times. Perhaps I'm naive.I'm certainly glad that I checked this book out at the library and did not waste money on it."
5,"OK, so I'm biased. . .",". . . because I live around Boston. But still, this is bar none some of the best detective fiction I've ever read. I was prompted to write after I just finished A Drink for the fifth or sixth time. Lehane's characters are gripping, his plots are interesting, and the issues they are forced to confront are never easy ones. Kenzie and Gennaro make a great team, and the chemistry between them is great, because it is, like the characters themselves, flawed by the world they live in. They are not ""heroes"" like Spenser, they don't always win in the way that heroes win. Boston should be proud to have produced an author as talented as Lehane, who gives us a taste of what Boston is really like, not the Robert Parker version, which though I enjoy, is not as stirring."
2,I guess I'm in the minority....,"....because I didn't really care for this book. Although it's a somewhat fast read, it felt like it took forever to get through it because the story was unoriginal and uninteresting.Dennis Lehane knows how to write a good sentence, but all of those sentences didn't amount to much in this book. Honestly, I thought the story was quite boring and although I desperately wanted to get into it, I couldn't. The story was plodding and the book was filled with so much extra filler that it seemingly could have been cut in half.Cliches and stereotypes abound and it felt like Lehane used them to makeup for his lack of ""street"" knowledge. It was like watching a poorly made TV show or a made-for-TV movie on USA.I'm forced to scratch my head to figure out why so many people have favorable reviews for this book. I thought it was pedestrian and bland."
1,Trashy little novel,"Boy, I don't know where to start... I picked this up as an alternative to 'The Given Day' which came highly recommended. I didn't have time to finish the 600 page novel so tried 'A Drink' instead. I didn't like it at all. A hackneyed tale of racist Boston area thugs and druggies abusing and killing each other... The characters were typical; the writing childish; the story line silly. If they ever make a movie out of this novel it should be set in Mexico where a very REAL and SCARY drug war is happening."
3,"Entertaining, great dialogue, but over the top action","In typical Dennis Lehane style, the characters are fantastic and the dialogue is raiser sharp with lots of wit thrown in. But the book sadly looses credibility with some of the highly unlikely action scenes, particular one where the hero and heroes pay local street kids to get their car from under the noses of a gang only to set themselves up with a car chase/shoot-'m-up that leads appropriately to a dead-end street. Overall an entertaining read though."
3,good intro...,"while not as absorbing as GONE, BABY, GONE and not as intricate a plotline this book is nonetheless a great intro to the characters. Lehane writes from his gut and there's not a whole lot of filler. Great characters and story."
4,Great beginning...,"A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR is a great beginning to what I hope will be a great series. This is the first book by Dennis Lehane I have read and I look forward to the next in the series.Patrick Kenzie and Ange Gennaro are PI partners hired to find some missing documents from a senator's office. Kenzie and Gennaro think this will be a simple case however it becomes more complex with each clue they follow. The documents turn out to be something many people are looking for, for various reasons.I enjoyed the relationship between Kenzie and Gennaro. The book is well written - lots of twists and turns, reads quickly and is thoroughly enjoyable."
3,kind of disappointing,"I approached this book with high expectations, and there were things I liked. Kenzie's wisecracking narration was always entertaining, and he and Gennaro were interesting main characters. But the plot was simplistic, the violence was cartoonish and over the top (too many Uzi shootouts), and the bad guys weren't motivated by anything other than Lehane's apparent desire to provoke readers' moral outrage."
4,4 1/2 Stars for a Great Start,"I enjoyed this book very much, and I think it's obvious from the other reviews that this book is enjoyed by the masses. Lehane is now a widely popular author and he earned his reputation by writing gripping books. It's hard to believe this is his first one. Many authors show the potential from the start, but few show the ability to characterize and provide a great story on their first try. This book delivers. If you are a fan of Robert Parker, Robert Crais, or Harlan Coben be sure to jump in on a Lehane novel. If you haven't read any of those authors, don't be intimidated it's time to pick this book up. I regret waiting as long as I did."
4,Great Debut for the Kenzie and Gennaro series,"The first Lehane book that I read was Mystic River which was sooooo good that I decided to read all of his books. I have only been disappointed by Shutter Island which was about psychology which is not the kind of book that keeps my attention. His other eight books, including this one, were exceptional and deserve either four or five stars. Lehane is one of the best storytellers out there today.The story is set in Boston as PIs Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro are hired by some high level politicians to recover documents that disappeared along with a cleaning lady. This was to be a simple document recovery case until they realized that they are under surveillance and suspect that something else is in play. Soon they are targets of not one but two of the most vicious gangs in Boston. One gang leader is a father, the other his son which leads to a gang war of distrust, violence and fierce retaliation with an explosive conclusion.al-Qaeda Strikes Again"
5,excellent,"I first read Dennis Lehane in Gone Baby Gone recommended to me by a book shop in Martha's Vineyard. I immediately bought his next book Prayers for Rain, and recommend both highly. While in Prague over Xmas, and out of books, I found a shop that sold a few dated English books, A Drink before The War was unexpectedly superb. When I returned to the US I immediately bought Sacred and, Darkness, Take My Hand. Highly recommend."
5,Great Action but a Better Story,This is a close up look at Boston's underbelly. The reader is transported to a violent world populated by vicious gangs made up of violent sociopaths. Lehane introduces racism and its effects on individuals and society through the eyes of his Private Detectives. All of this is then the backdrop for a marvelous mystery that leads the protagonists on a violent tear through one of America's greatest cities.Highly Recommended !
4,An Outstanding and Varied Series,"If you're reading this review, it's probably because you haven't yet tried Dennis Lehane and are wondering if you should. The answer is an emphatic yes, and this is where to begin (Lehane's books must be read in order, because he divulges earlier secrets in later books).Lehane is an excellent writer, there are unexpected twists that even the most sophisticated reader is unlikely to guess, he includes interesting and thought-provoking social criticisms, his protagonists are likable, and gore is kept to reasonable limits necessary to the plot. Lehane is far more interesting than James Lee Burke, whose protagonist is all too reminiscent of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee and who repeats themes too often (bad guys beat up hero, hero gets even by punching out bad guys, et cetera). If you like mysteries and/or crime stories, Lehane is well worth trying."
4,True Mysteries,Have just discovered the Patrick and Angela series and like the interaction and dialogue between them. Not to mention story lines I cannot predict. These factors make page turners for sure. Hard to put down!
5,Outstanding!,"I can't really add more than the other five star reviewers other than echo their comments. I discovered this book which was written in 1994 only recently and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the read! The author penned a great thriller that kept me reading late into the night. I love his style of writing, a little humor, lots of action, likeable characters, descriptive settings, great plot. It just doesn't get much better than this! My recommendation, don't read the blurbs about this book. Just read it and let the author pull you through the action as the layers begin to unfold. Highly recommended!"
3,a competent early Dennis Lehane novel; not his best though..,"'A Drink Before the War' is the first of several crime novels by Dennis Lehane involving two young Boston private investigators, Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. As will all Lehane novels the writing is uniformly good, the characterizations believable, and the dialogue sharp. However 'A Drink Before the War', a story about gang warfare and corrupt politicians, is somewhat preachy in tone. I found all the overt rascism to be a bit over-dramatized, the anti-rascism rhetoric to be tiresome. In between Lehane throws in plenty of violence and ugliness. While certainly a competent read it was gratuitously nasty. In the end I felt bad for being a white American, ... was that the point of the book?Bottom line: good, but too much of hate-fest. For Lehane fans only."
2,not worth the time,"After finishing the book, and not really enjoying it at all, I read the amazon reviews. All of the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews are spot on and no need to repeat those criticisms again. But I will say, it was particularly annoying to have the author ""explain"" the book to you in the last few chapters."
2,Not Heavy-Duty Enough,Not strong enough. Bent the very first day. I've since learned you need a training wheel that is reinforced with another bar that makes a triangle and does not allow the main bar to flare out. These were a piece of junk and certainly no better than you can buy at the big box stores. Wasted my money.
5,A Note,Just a note to correct the Amazon book description that states that Levi committed suicide. He did not. He fell to his death down a staircase in his apartment house.
4,Excellent,Read only a chapter (which are long) at a time because Kimmel packs so much info into topics that your brain needs time to put ideas into behaviors you can incorporate into your parenting. A great read!
5,Chill out!,This book was excellent in teaching me to chill out and have fun with my kids. I was trying to make them behave by giving them too many rules to live by. This book showed me how to ease up and enjoy them. Take away some of the rules that just brought our family down and have fun while taking the opportunity to teach Gos'd love and grace when their hearts are open to hear it!
2,Couldn't get into this book...not what I expected,"I purchased this book thinking it would be a great guide to parent my children with more spirituality, but I could not get into it at all. I tried reading the book about 3 times and finally just gave up. The book was boring and I felt that the examples given were not realistic or were blown way out of proportion. I would not recommend this book. I will be looking for a better book at the library first next time! Very disappointed!"
2,Not worth buying.,"I bought this book because I love reading any parenting book to get different views. I was disappointed. While he had a few good points and ideas, I would not parent my child this way. I am not legalistic and I don't parent by fear, but I'm also not going to let my kids dye their hair any color they want and I'm not going to put my kids in a youth group where the music is like a rock band and call that worship. I do not recommend this book."
3,Never hurts to read another parenting book.,"This book is about parenting with grace. It's about preparing your kids for the world and not preparing the world for your kids.The author warns us against the pitfalls of legalistic decision making. He is clearly pro-public schools and anti-private, almost to the point of insulting those who have chosen private. Although he emphasizes the concept of keeping your home grace-based, there aren't a lot of examples of what that really looks like. The book was o.k. if you are not a sensitive private-schooling family."
5,Still Reading-Great Book!,"I am still in the process of reading this book, but from what I have read so far, it is a great book and resource for Parenting. I look forward to putting what I have read so far, into practice. This book as is much for the Parent's relationship with God, as it is for the Parent's relationship with the children. Shows how GRACE can change lives and relationships, and how it is the best way to Parent."
5,Excellent Helpful Read!,"Grace Based Parenting is a wonderful guide to loving and guiding children as God lovingly wants to guide humanity. I have my clients read this when they feel overwhelmed to be the perfect parent, or believe that there is only one way to parent, or are feeling defeated in their parenting skills. There is ""GRACE"" for both parents and child. A must read!"
5,Great Read,"Very helpful book! I love his advice! Anyone with children should study this book. It gives ""outside the box"" help."
5,Only just started,"I am new at this parenting thing and am still only in the beginning phases of this book, but I can already tell from the introduction, tone and demonstrations Kimmel uses that my husband and I agree with his method of parenting. Basically, it's pointing our children to the One who can."
3,Grace Based Parenting,"This book is filled with great information. It is a great tool to help give you realistic expectations of your kids and how to show them real love that is not based on performance but rather on their God-given value. In a world where love is hard to find, this books helps you make your home that safe place for your kids to be who they were created by God to be and not who we, as parents, try to make them. Every parent needs to read this book."
2,Cannot compete with the many great recordings out there,"I feel that one cannot have too many versions of the Bach Cello Suites because each performer brings a unique sound and interpretation to these wonderful pieces, so I am always on the lookout for any new ones. This one by Martin Zeller (volume one only) just cannot compete with the likes of Queyras, Klinger, Isserlis, Wispelwey, Pergamenschikov, Mork, Thedeen or the legendary Casals. His tempos are too agogic and the microphone sounds as if it was placed inside his cello (way too close). Most importantly, there's not much poetry here. I won't be looking out for volume 2."
3,The Second Mrs Adams by Sandra Marton,"Description from the book back cover:David Adams wasn't about to let his wife back into his life. He'd been about to divorce Joanna when she'd had the accident. Just because she'd undergone a complete personality change since, and turned back into the lovely girl he'd married, that didn't mean he'd fallen right back in love with her too! What he felt now for Joanna was lust. But, sooner or later, her memory would return. And when it did this pretence of a real marriage would be over ..."
3,"ALTHOUGH GOOD, THIS GUY IAN W SEEMS TO HAVE A RELIGIOUS AGENDA","Judging from the other books Ian Wilson has written, he seems to have a PARTIAL (not IMPARTIAL) religious agenda,trying to PUSH his religious views, that have been called into question by SO MANY AUTHORS in the last 50 to 300years...........I did like the Introduction and first couple of chapters in ""The After Death Experience"", but, I'vscanned the concluding chapter and found it wanting, but, will not judge the book until I've fully read it....yearsago, I scanned the whole book and made yellow marker highlights throughout the book, but, want to sink my teeth intoit some more now."
3,"Good disc, but better if you don't have the other albums","The biggest problem with this CD is that for the price, thereis only ONE previously unreleased song included (...)The other songs are a mixture of tracks from the three WB releases; nothing from their fourth album (with only Marq Torien and Lonnie Vencent from the original lineup present) ""Acid Monkey"" has been included. Rock Candy, an excellent cover of the Montrose classic is here, but WAS released previously on the Wayne's World soundtrack, so chances are that the true BB fan already has spent $$ on that disc. It's disappointing that there is only one new song on the disc. Fans can only hope that the BulletBoys will release an album of new material soon."
4,Good cd,Bought this cd for my husband and he really enjoys listening to it! Great price and we will continue buying cds!
2,Poor excuse for a comeback album,"Don't get me wrong, I've liked the Bulletboys since I first saw their video for ""Smooth Up In Ya"" in 1988 on MTV. But this album is poorly done. Why not just make a compilation of greatest hits and be done with it? The songs do not sound the same as Torien's voice has gone to crap, and the music itself sounds like it was done in an oversized trashcan.I'd suggest to others not to buy this album, and instead purchase a good one like ""Freak Show"" or their self-titled masterpiece."
4,"Braverino, but bad title","The Bulletboys are easily one of the best 3,584 bands out there today and taking all of their hits and putting them onto one disc is no easy task. I mean, there's ""Smooth up in ya"" and, um, some other great songs that I just can't remember right off hand. This collection nails it though. Bulletboys are in that Ratt, Britney Fox, Zebra pantheon of great metal bands that make Burt Reynolds wish he'd do another Smokey and the Bandit movie. But what's with the title? I'm a lover of cats. I have 25 of them at home. There's Washinfeet the siamese cat, Cramps the bobcat, Kurtis Blow the jaguar, Keithen McCant the tabby and 21 other cats I love more than my Zwol collection. Why burn them Bulletboys? What did the cats do to you? And picking on amputees? That's truly tasteless. Rick Allen would walk up to you and say, ""I can't fell muh Ahm"" and whoop you with his good arm if he so chose. So, I think the music is awesome, but I would've called the album Friskies in my pants."
3,ok but not great,They should have countersunk the attach holes in the hinges and I had to alter the spare tire bumper to get one hinge to fit.
3,good intro to Scandinavian roots music,"This collection is great way to get your feet wet in the fjords of Scandinavian roots music. It contains excellent tracks from some of the leaders of the Scand folk revival, which I find every bit as exciting (and considerably less glitzy) as the recent developments in Celtic music. The only critique that I can give is that it leans a bit too heavily towards tunes in major, while much of the Scand root music is extremely dark. That and some of the picks are not the best from the albums they represent; Wimme Saari should sue over his worst pieces being put on the sampler. Still, the tracks from Vasen, Garmarna, Triakel, Swap, and Hedningarna make it worth far more than the $3 price tag (cheaper than food! the cover boasts). It is top-quality music, for the most part. I bought five copies to hand out to friends and relatives, and I wholly expect to purchase more."
2,hardcore folk,"I bought this but was disappointed to find it was focussed entirely on down-to-the-bone hardcore folk. Some tracks are pretty harsh on the ear and overall there is not much variety of sound. However I do recommend the 3CDBeginner's Guide to Scandinaviawhich presents a much broader variety of styles and artists and countries! It has one disc devoted to folk & roots which is fantastic. The other two discs also have a strong folk flavour. As a whole, it's the perfect introduction to the music of the Nordic world."
3,Various artists and various quality,"About half the music is really good and catching, but just as many of the melodies are boring or too similar to each other. The quality is very varied and while some of the music should rate as 5 stars, I choose 3 stars as an average for the whole cd."
5,A Musical Feast from Scandinavia!,"This is the CD that started my love affair with Scandinavian music! There is not a clunker in the bunch. This will appeal to people of myriad musical tastes--traditional, folk, pop, ethnic and beyond. If you already like the genre, there will undoubtedly be new discoveries here; if you're new to the world of Scandinavian music...this is the perfect place to start!! This disc, and its follow-up CD ""Nordic Roots 2"" are full-length complilations with incredible sound quality and an even more incredible low price!! Don't hesitate...try them today! And if you like what you hear, here's a ""Shameless Plug,"" ... :o) Enjoy this music!!"
4,WARNING: NOT A REMASTER,"Four stars for the album, which is superb. But if you're in the US and you have this already, and were hoping to upgrade, forget it. Despte the fact that Astral Werks has been trumpeting these Be Bop Deluxe rereleases on its site-- with expanded booklets! Whoopee!-- these are, in fact, straight reissues of the old 1990 CD editions. Expanded booklets my ass: these booklets have been scanned from the old ones. And the mixes are identical to the 1990 editions. These so-called new editions are roughly as far, chronologically, from the original CD editions as those editions were from the LP releases. But no improvements have been made in this case. Another sterling instance of a record company simply not giving a damn. You should wait for the upcoming boxset, which Mr. Nelson is preparing even as we speak."
5,Tremendous glam-rock album,"This is perhaps the best Be-Bop Deluxe album (close race with Sunburst Finish) and features more focus on guitar playing by Bill Nelson than subsequent efforts. Since no one has mentioned it, I nominate ""No Trains to Heaven"" as a classic guitar song. Triple-tracked bliss. Melody, power, that British early 70's glam touch - you just can't beat it. Buy this album, Sunburst Finish, and maybe Modern Music and you've got all you need from BBD."
5,I can't wait to listen to this record for the first time in,I can't wait to listen to this record for the first time in 20 years. This was a perennial favorite of my brainyjockystonerloser brat pack. Quintessential glam rock. Buy it and wear it out.
3,Pretty Fly For Alleged Bowie Clones,"Yes, yes, the Bowie influence is all over this one; I mean, ""Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus""? So let's say it and get it out of the way: Bill Nelson was probably trying to see and raise ""The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars."" So were an awful lot of other people. Except that Nelson came at it in his own way, and not just because his guitar work betrays more Hendrix influence than Bowie's Mick Ronson did. Nelson wasn't quite the cynic Bowie was, though you'd certainly not think of him as a sunny positivist. Given that, ""Axe Victim"" was a pretty audacious debut, even if the production could have stood some improvement and the title cut seemed just a little bit forcing it. No one should have worried - Nelson and Be Bop Deluxe had plenty left to come before they finished."
1,Ugh...,"Damn! About little less than a month ago I gave this one 4 STARS. It deserves nowhere near that many. I've since listened to more of the BBD catalogue and can safely say that this is easily the worst album these guys ever released. The only real standout is 'Adventures' and even that one can be bland. 'Rocket Cathedrals' and the title track are two of the STUPIDEST songs I've ever heard! Pathetic attempts at 'rocking out' by then-amateurs. There's nothing original or unique on this album; Nelson (thankfully) saved that for the later albums. Save your money on this and buy Sunburst Finish, Futurama, and Live in the Air Age instead."
2,Immature debut.,"This is by far the weakest effort within the brilliant Be Bop Deluxe catologue. At this point, in his career Bill Nelson had yet to develop an original style and voice. This ""glam"" recording pays homage to Ziggy era Bowie, at the cost of surrendering originality. Nelson was obviously displeased with the effort as he sacked the entire band afterward. All recordings after this were terrific and well worth procuring. Give this one a pass...Simon"
1,It looks like what it's called -- FAKE,"It looks like a lump of brown plastic--shiny--reddish / brown -plastic -looking. Not what I wanted, but it was pretty cheap."
1,The Laughing Stock of the Fake Poo World,"If you are looking at this product you either A) Were so bored that you did a random search for ""poo"" and this came up, or B) Are actually considering buying fake poo online.I am I guess what you can say a fake poo expert. And I must say, this product is rubbish. As I said in the title, this is the laughing stock of the fake poo world. The company that made this should honestly quit the fake poo making business. Making fake poo of this calibur is downright embarrasing.With that being said, go do a google search for fake poo. You'll be stunned with the amazing products that come up."
4,Funny but not great,"I have something like this.One day I put on the steps and my dad thought it was the real ""THING."" We do have a dog but he would not do that."
4,Small but good looking,They are a bit smaller then I imagined but whatever. People/hippies have started to install fake grass around my neighborhood so I've been buying these and placing them on the fake grass. Fake poop on fake grass = funnyhaha.If you walk by you can notice it fine and you will laugh but they are a little too small to be noticed and appreciated by people driving by.
3,Uhhhhhh...,"This poo is ALRIGHT, but it doesn't really LOOK like poo. So, i don't recomend it, there is better fake poo in the world."
2,Photoshop was Obviously Used...,"I ordered this, and was very pleased with how quickly the product got to me, and how it was packaged. Once opened the, product had a plastic like sheen on it, that looked slighty shiny.Pros: Doesnt leave marks or smells (carpet, car seats)Cons: Looks too fake."
5,Talk about good advice,"This bible/magazine is awesome. It is constructed in a way that it draws you in. I think this book is great for many reasons. The first being it is the word of God and that alone is what its about. Secondly, this book is attractive. Face it ladies, no matter how old we are always drawn to things that attract us or shall I say catches our eye. This book is perfect for the person who never reads a book because it appears to be dull. Along with embodying th word of God this book also has little side notes and and stories by other christian women. Overall this book is a winner, I highly recommend it. If you don't think that you would like it for yourself then purchase it for a friend. It would make an excellant gift!"
1,Fashion Mag or Word of God? Who Can Tell?,"My husband and I saw a copy of this ""magazine"" in our local Christian bookstore. We were deeply saddened and disturbed to find that God's Holy Word had been placed within the pages of such immature chatter.Our society has become so dependent upon the visually stimulating that now even Christians aren't satisfied with the pure Words of the Bible without being entertained and pampered while reading it.It's not our place to attempt to ""bring God down to the level of the world."" God is God and He is holy and just. When we try to paste beads, feathers...or fashion models on the sufficient Word of God, then we make a mockery of His power and the purity of His Word. The Bible (literally God's Word to us) is alive, exciting, beautiful, and not in need of a costume."
2,Almost worth it...,"I purchased this book as well as FREE college and training money for women. Both books provide TONS of resources but you will need time to sift through them to determine your eligbility. However the books are HUGE let downs in that they have duplicate information, not only on the pages of each book itself, but both of them carry identical programs or information. They simply changed the print and layout of the books. My best advice is to buy whichever of Mr. Lesko's books you beleive is best suited to your own situation, and save your money, don't purchase any others. You will only get repeat information."
2,A Disappointment,"Although I fit the catagory of being a ""busy mom"", I had a very hard time finding anything in this book that I could benefit from. Much of the book is filled with opportunities for those in a low-income bracket meeting the criteria for government subsidies. For people in that situation, this book would be a wonderful resource - and is well researched. Between the asssistance for low-income families, senior citizens, those seeking lovers and cheap abortions I found little I could apply to my life. The book also could be organized better. An enormous amount of information is given without any way to sift through it and find the opportunities that one would qualify for."
4,Very useful info,"I picked this book up at the library and kept it over my time limit -- this book has a lot of useful info in it not to mention which agencies you need to refer to in your own state like dept of higher education, transportation dept and many more. If help is what your looking for then you are starting on the right track w/ this book"
2,"Book was published in 1999, seems outdated.","Our favorite government spaz appears to have branched into the categories of parents! This book was published in 1999, so alot of the information may be outdated. Oh well, at least he's not screaming in my face during a commercial to buy this book!"
1,Batteries did not take a charge,I bought 2 batteries. They arrived promptly. When inserted into my Dell Latitude C840 neither one would take a charge. I contacted the seller. They said that I should update the computer BIOS. The Bios was already at the most recent version. Then they said to discharge the batteries to less that 3% and then recharge for 10 hours. One battery is currently at 6% and I haven't tried to draw it down to less than 3% so as of yet I don't know if the sellers recommendation will work. I doubt it. It is almost impossible to use a laptop as a portable device if you have to discharge the batteries almost completely before you can recharge them. I suspect the problem is with my laptop. I suspect that if it doesn't detect an OEM battery it won't recharge it.
3,Bad battery or what?,"Installed in Del l laptop, charged for 24hours, tried laptop after 1 hour go t low battery warningDon't have another battery to compare, or know what to expect, will do some research and find out later.Computer is a Dell D-600 with a 100 gig hard drive."
1,not what I expected,I searched for a specific battery model and purchased this battery based on a link that was delivered in my search results. The battery doesn't work with my computer so it's a complete waste of money.
1,"If you loved River God, you'll hate this novel","I was so incredibly disappointed with this novel. The beauty of it's prequel River God was that it was a touching, human story (with just a touch of mysticism.) I love the book so much I have read it many, many times. In this ""sequel"" the author chooses to discard or ignore characters from the first novel, and instead focuses on extremely unrealistic magic. It almost made me ill to see such wonderful characters brought so low. And be warned: it was written to allow for at least one more book. I certainly will not read another book based on this rubbish. (I will however read River God again. And again.)"
1,Warlock:Wilbur Smith,"Having read and enjoyed almost all of Wilbur Smith's adventure stories, I must confess that his latest proved to be disappointing. Sustained, almost unbearable suspense, and excellent historical material has contributed to the success of all of the many books I've read by him. The author failed to keep up the excitement and interest about halfway through. Although Smith has always included violence, it has been appropriately used. Here, I'm afraid, it was overdone to the extreme. The action was slow and, at times, boring. I'm sorry to see one of my favorite adventure authors lose the touch by trying to revive a sequel to a success."
1,Horrible & Graphic Perversion,"Never even finished the book. I made it through the first half and was so disgusted with the graphic violence, torture,* etc. that I had no desire to read on. The story was alright, though slow moving. If you have any aversion to the above mentioned, don't waste your time or money. I'll never consider another Wilbur Smith book after my experience with this one."
2,certainly not his best work,"he likes to write long books, but this one is too much. The magic is too much, the boring conversation is too much & the constant references to an aging eunuch are especially too much.His series on the Ballyntynes is much better in all regards."
1,"Stink, stank, stunk","River God ranks on my list of all time favorite novels. But Warlock is not only a bad book - it cheapens the legacy Smith created in River God and Seventh Scroll.Several errors of judgement have been made in crafting this novel. River God, through it's first person narrative, and the conceit of being an epic translated from ancient scrolls had truly mythic depth. It completely worked, and arrogant as Taita was, he was also deeply endearing. Warlock's 3rd person narrative never comes together, and makes Taita both irritating and unsympathetic as a character. As well, making Taita a caster of magic spells actually takes away from the magic that existed in River God. Wilbur Smith has no clue how to write fantasy.A sad addition to what was a brilliant pair of novels."
3,Excellent read,Good yarn based on historical Fact ? Enjoyable But do not have sleepless nights over it! If it happened it was thousands of years ago. We have wars of much greater depth right now!
4,Vintage Wilbur Smith,Warlock is a well researched and Very well Written. Smith has been wrioting beautifull prose for over 40 years. His So African stories -when read sequentially provide a living history that is presented thru fiction.
5,Another awesome installment,"I've read previous novels by this author and he quickly became one of my favorites. He writes on a number of different subjects from ancient Egypt, to the history of colonization of Africa. But the stories are always well told and you feel like you are going along on an epic adventure!"
2,Read his early work,"Read ""The Warlock "" in two days. I was dissapointed. The only reason I was not utterly dissapointed is because judging from his last couple of books I have lowered my expectation significantly, and yet still I was dissapointed. To be fair, it is probably not that bad of a book.. but only if you have not read River God and Seventh Scroll. Smith reduced Taita from a clever and cunning strategist to a Harry Potter wannabe.I miss the Wilbur Smith of ""River God"", ""Seventh Scroll"", early Courtney Saga. I am sad that the same person who wrote those wonderful books is now writing Warlock and Monsoon (which is a good book by itself, but in terms of plot is nothing more than a poor imitation of his earlier work. This is the third time in the same family that there are two brothers who used to love each other and ended up as mortal enemy, the second time that the weaker brother's son is actually the illegitimate son of the stronger one )"
2,River God meets Lord of the Rings,"After reading RIVER GOD, it became one of my all time favorite novels, and made me discover the great story telling capabilities of Wilbur Smith. But WARLOCK takes Taita, the wonderfully developed character from RIVER GOD, and turns him into an all powerful sorcerer. This would not have been a problem if Smith had started the series with magic in mind. One of RIVER GOD's best qualities was the realism of the characters. But all of a sudden Taita is casting spells and magical webs. On a literary note, Smith composed RIVER GOD in the 1st person, giving Taita's charcter an astounding sense of depth and believability. But WARLOCK jumps into the minds of all the characters and doesn't allow the reader to truly understand Taita. It was as if someone else wrote this novel, and Smith attached his name. The bottom line: If you enjoyed RIVER GOD, steer away from this novel, as it will disturb the wonderful story that Smith left us with his first book."
3,"Perfect for ""summer reading""","This is a typical ""best seller action book"", and just as the blockbuster action movies, it delivers great entertaning.This book is a ""must have"" for the people that read the first two episodes of Smith's Egypt saga. The author previously succeeded in making the reader care about the chracters as if they were relatives, so it's nice to ""hear from them now"".Maybe the end is somehow not consistent in quality with the rest of the novel, but i think that improoving it would take few more pages than someone would like to read. So it's understandable."
2,A Major Let Down,"River Gods is one of my all time favorite books - first I read the book and then I listened to it on tape. The Seventh Scroll was okay, but I am more interested in stories staged in ancient Egypt so when I heard that Wilbur Smith had released Worlock I couldn't wait to read it. What a let down! The character of Taita was the staple of River Gods - you felt his pain and you cheered for him - he was strong, smart & clever, yet very human. In Worlock Taita is a wizard of sorts - and not a very deep one at that. It is not that I am against tales of scorcery, it is just that Taita was such a fantastic character ""as is"" - he doesn't need all that mumbo-jumbo. I also felt there was too much war and fighting with too predicatable outcomes. I would like to have seen a little more behind the scene storylines and more clever and cunning acts by Taita."
2,Turn off.,"I'm relieved to see I'm not the only one disappointed in Warlock, because it's only the second Wilbur Smith I've read, and the other was much better. I was very uncomfortable with the soft porn relating to children in Warlock, which was completely unnecessary, and also the description of the suffering of animals. I actually found myself covering up the offensive text with a pen as I went so that nobody else would have to see it. Mr. Smith's descriptive talent was used much more effectively in Sunbird. I'm relieved that Warlock is the exception, rather than Sunbird."
2,This is not the Taita I know.,"Having very much enjoyed River God, and references to Taita inThe Seventh Scroll, I expected to enjoy this book too. But hereTaita is not as I recall him at all. Before he used his wit andlearning to do marvelous things, but in a way that made itpossible to think of him as a real person. In this book he alsodoes marvelous things but via magic and communion with the gods,all of which are portrayed as real. This Taita could never havereally existed. Instead of an historical novel, we get a fantasynovel.Also, the style of writing is very different, more clipped and itjust doesn't flow. I get the impression that the author istrying to imitate the style in the series of Ramses books, whichI didn't like at all. Did an understudy write this?"
2,Dear oh Dear...,"I expected more from this writer than the fetishism and objectificaton of race and gender I have just had to endure to complete this novel. Historical inaccuracies aside, I counted no less than 20 different examples of blatant racism and representations of otherness that frankly,have no place in a book by a writer of Wilbur Smiths supposed calibre.This novel reads like the Orientalist rantings of an aging Imperialist!.Incongruous inclusions of bestiality (p.200),peodophilia(p.146 young breasts in first bud like ripened mulberries..soft fluff etc etc),bodification(p.143) and blatant rascism throughout(note esp the black Nubian slaves with big oiled genitals..)tsk tsk..C'mon Mr Smith, surely just because the story is set 3000 years ago doesn't mean such reductionism and misogyny is acceptable? Deeply disappointing read,especially as the action scenes are fantastic and detail of the country near perfect."
4,All about Taita,"The prior reviewer must have read the French version.This book was a great return to Taita's Egypt.I read River God and loved it, having never heard of Wilber Smith. Followed up with 7th scroll and was disappointed (until the end). Warlock picks up where River God left off.The book is different Smith spends MUCH more time on Taita, although I feel I still don't know much about him. The book is a bit long in character development, and many authors could (or would) have written less, yet I still have trouble putting his books down. Maybe it's me.Looking forward to the fourth in the series (?). For now I'm surfing for more WAS titles."
5,Warlock,"This book is engrossing from the first pages and is relentless in its pace. Do yourself a favor though. If you haven't read River God by Wilbur Smith yet, get it and read it first. It is as good if not better than Warlock and is the introduction to characters & events you will read about in Warlock. Be ready to put other events on hold because this book really is hard to put down. It is amazing how much detail Wilbur Smith puts in his books about ancient Egypt. It is as if he lived during those times and is reincarnated. Follow up this book with the 7th Scroll."
4,GOOD READ - GOOD SEQUEL,"READ River God first, but this is a pretty good sequel to River God. This book is at times unbelievable, but very enjoyable. I love Wilbur Smith and can't wait to read more of his older stuff."
2,Wilbur is losing it.,"As one who has read all of Wilbur Smith's novels through the years, this one is a real disappointment. Most of Smiths novels weave a great story, while giving us insight into Africa, it's history, culture and traditions. Warlock, unfortunately, doesn't come close to doing this. Instead, it reads like some kind of teenybopper romance novel, filled with gore and sexual escapades. There is little suspense and you can usually see the story unfolding pages ahead...."
3,Interesting Flollow-up to River God,"This was a good read and and interesting follow-up to the River God. However, it didn't add much about Egyption history and many parts of the book were overly predictable. I would recommend it for Wilbur Smith fans, especially those who have read River God."
1,u do not get whats in the picture,its trash its not what it looks like in the picture i bought this after i bought one that stopped working after 15 mins then i buy this one and its the same thing its not the one u see in the picture.
3,Puttin it down for the bay,"nickatina always comes tight with his flows and this cd is no different. The first song of this album is the standout and ""business brains"" is the second best with cougnut. This cd lacks major depth to be a classic compilation though."
5,AYO FOR YAYO!!!!!!!!!,This cd is tight Andre Nickatina has good beats and his funky voice makes him one of the greatest rappers of the nineties if you like that song get also Cocaine Raps Vol 1 or Daquiri Factory both are of his first productions
5,Nice,I am fan of Mazinger Z and all the other toys. This is really nice. Looks perfect. I liked it a lot.
5,Excellent True Crime,"As a true crime fanatic I think this is the most readable and fascinating example of the genre I have ever read. John Glatt does a first rate job of unravelling this unique crime behind the SIDS backdrop which protected Marie Noe, who cold-bloodedly killed eight of her children, for almost 50 years.His strenuous research is an example of the heights that true crime books can attain. I would recommend this to everyone as a 'can't put down page turner.'"
4,Interesting reading,"I can't say that this book was anywhere near one of the best true crime books I have ever read, but it did make for some interesting reading. I put off purchasing this book many times because although I like true crime, I am really not enthusiastic about reading stories where innocent babies are murdered, by their own mother nonetheless. It was pitiful the way this woman snuffed out the lives of her innocent children, and for no obvious reason. Hard to believe that when her babies were dying one by one in the 1960's, no one thought it peculiar. If this were happening to someone I know now, I would certainly think something was up. This woman makes you very angry. Being in her seventies now, her age seems to have played a part in her punishment. I have no pity for her, 27 or 70, it makes no difference. She is a murderer, plain and simple."
4,Lack of intelligence...,"I felt that the author wanted you to believe that these murders happened because the mother was uneducated, maybe mentally slow, and was possibly abused. Many people have endured much more with much less and they don't become serial killers. The husband is just as responsible for these babies death as the mother is. He could have put a stop to it, by preventing them from having more. The punishment is a slap in the face for those babies. They were never given a chance, because she snuffed the life out of each one of them before them could defend themselves. Her life should have ended just the same. It breaks my heart to think about all those good people out there that cannot have children, but would make excellent parents. And here is someone that took advantage of her gift and just threw it away like an pair of shoes."
4,Couldn't stop reading this story!,I am a native Philadelphian and remember this story. This book really gave details that the newspapers didn't cover. Sad story.
4,"Mommy Kills 8 of 10 Children, Walks Away with Light Sentence","The reviewers here have covered the emotion evoked by CRADLE OF DEATH very well; that is, Marie Noe got away with murdering eight of her ten children. (And the death total by Marie would have been, undoubtedly, the full 10 if nature had not beaten her to the punch).This emotion provoking tale of a mother who kills her children one by one over a span of 18 years will leave its readers baffled, frustrated and angry with the justice system AND her seemily dimwitted husband, Arthur, who proclaims his wife's innocence.This is a must read for any true crime fan. It is a quick read, yet very well written. You won't be able to put it down!"
5,Required bio reading,"This book, which appears to be about the only surviving scientific text from Kropotkin's work, is very interesting and insightful. The first two chapters which deal with animals I found most interesting, because they address the roots of the falsehood of social-darwinism. Kropotkin then proceeds to move through the different stages of human society and describes the mutual aid a compassion fetures therein. It is a fantastic book and I highly recommend it. It is a scientific text, but it has major political implications and is very accessible."
4,"Not Cutting Edge, But Good Enough","Difficult to find clarity of picture and sound in a DVD remastered from a Paleolithic movie, but this one's better than anything else of its age on the market. Clear enough to still bring tears...."
5,Small Town,"For anyone out there that loves nostalgia, then this is for you.The depictions of small town Canada/America couldn't be better. I hadseen this movie many years ago and had waited, in vain, for a rerunon TV that I could tape. Thank goodness for Amazon. Whenever I feelthe need to re live those wonderful bygone times, I now have the means.I highly recommend it."
2,"Our Town, 1940",This 1940 movie version has dialogue that is almost exactly as in the stage version of the play. The film quality and the sound quality left much to be desired.Some sections were almost impossible to hear clearly.
2,Our Town,The quality of this movie is very poor. It's as if it was recorded on VHS from a television broadcast in the 1970's and then transferred to DVD. I've always liked this movie but this recording is very difficult to enjoy because of the poor quality.
1,Don't Buy the Miracle Pictures Edition,"The picture quality of the Miracle Pictures DVD edition of ""Our Town"" is absolutely abysmal--almost completely unwatchable; the Dolby sound quality is quite good. The Monterey VHS edition of the film has a much better picture if slightly worse sound."
2,Warning Spoiler--Not Our Town Ending,"I saw this on TV or got it from the library on VHS I think. I had seen the play with Robbie Benson on TV so I wanted to see how this older version compared. Well, they changed the ending in this version which spoils the whole point of the story. So if you have not seen any version, stop reading this review. Anyway, Emily doesn't die in this version. It's a dream. The whole point of this great Thornton Wilder play (I read it in high school, too.) is that people don't appreciate life, they don't stop and smell the roses. They don't savor every moment of their lives. It's not really a happy ending since one of the main characters dies young, but the play is supposed to make you think and look at your life and enjoy every precious moment. I think since Emily doesn't die in this version, it lessens the effectiveness of the message of the play. Find another version that is true to the original is my advice."
2,Drat,"I could not believe that anyone would have the right to change the ending of the wonderful play ""Our Town!"""
3,Good Enough,"This was a fairly accurate rendition of the play. The things that I didn't like was the quality. Because of the age of the filming, it was difficult to understand what was being said without turning the volume up way to loud. I was also disappointed that the lines were out of order from the play. I was hoping to follow the along reading the play while watching it played out and that was not possible. In addition the movie had a different ending from the play with the main character not dying. The only other drawback was that because it was a movie rather than a play, there was scenery and staging that the play did not allow for. Other than that it was very accurate. We, as a class, were able to watch it rather than read it or act it out."
2,COULD'VE BUT FOR AGE,"THE QUALITY OF THIS FILM IS TERRIBLE BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THE BEST THAT COULD'VE BEEN FOUND,HAVING BEEN TOLD BY OTHERS WHO HAVE SEEN IT IN THEATERS.OF COURSE THE PLAY IS GOOD AND ALL PERFORMERS DO THEIR BEST ESPECAILLY CRAVEN,SCOTT,AND BILL HOLDEN.HOLDEN IS INTERESTING HERE BECAUSE HE'S SO YOUNG AND FIDGETS LIKE A TEENAGE BOY REALLY WOULD FINDING HIS FIRST LOVE AND ADVANCING INTO MARRIAGE AND ADULTHOOD...HAS GREAT WAVEY HAIR!BUT IF YOU ARE A DVD PERFECTIONIST THIS VERSION IS NOT FOR YOU DUE TO THE BAD QUALITY OF THE COPY.BUT SOME OF US LIKE IT.THERE ARE MUCH NEWER VERSIONS ONE FEATURING PAUL NEWMAN FOR THE REST OF YOU!!"
1,Serves me right ...,... for not having checked these reviews before I bought the DVD. The technical quality - especially the sound - is just absolutely horrible. What a disappointment. I was unable to sit through the full 90 minutes. The worst DVD I have ever come across. Stay away from it!
2,American Classic.....Lousy DVD,"Our Town is one of the classics of the American stage, dutifully done though without the emotional impact in this film. This DVD copy brings neither to the table. The print is dark, the edges of some scenes are nearly blotted out and the sound is full of so many cracks and whistles, it makes you wish for sub titles. I am surprised no group has taken the time to clean this print up (although I am lead to believe that this was not a favorite of Wilder)."
1,WARNING!!! This DVD is a Bootleg!,"(This isn't a review of the film itself. Just the DVD itself.)This DVD isn't an official Region 1 DVD. It's a cheap, pirated Region 0 bootleg!Be careful when ordering DVDs from amazon, because some of the DVDs they sell (albeit, a small percentage) are bootleg (I.E.: ""Sailor Moon Stars-The Complete Bootlegged Collection"" (!?))Luckily, amazon has included in the description that this is a region 0 DVD (when I ordered this it wasn't in the description). But still, it's ridiculous that amazon KNOWS this is a bootleg, and doesn't take it down!"
1,What a disappointment,"As noted in the previous DVD reviews, the picture and sound quality are abominable. Shame on me for not checking the reviews before buying the disk.Perhaps the VHS transfer is better."
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"Purchased this fork mount for a non-CycleOps roller and had to do a little jury-rigging. Regardless, it still works and has me using the rollers when I'm not up to doing a full balance workout. A good way to gain the confidence with your rollers you'll need to go without the fork mount at some point."
4,ROY D. MERCER IS HIS NAME! AND HE'S GANNA PLAY A FEW GAMES.,Roy D. Mercer is a funny guy. Playing jokes on people saying he's going to kick there butt if they dont give him what he wants. Roy is just like The Jerky Boys but much cleaner. BE CAREFULL OF THAT NEXT PHONE CALL IT MAY JUST BE HIM...................
1,these guys should be ashamed of themselves,Roy D. Mercer is a rip-off of Leroy (NOT LEE ROY) Mercer. Do a search for Leroy Mercer aka John Bean and find out the real story.
1,A very UNfunny cd.,"These are the worst phony-phone calls that I have EVER heard, I assumed they would be funny, based on the other reviews- let's just say they were a HUGE disappointment. I love this type of humor, Roy Mercer is not humorous at all. I believe that the positive reviews must have been written by his family and record company. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GUY."
5,Car Dealer,"This is, no doubt, one of the most amusing tapes I have ever heard. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh!"
2,Good for limited service,"I bought this item 2 seasons ago and it has has ongoing issues. The Santa will not climb the ladder unless the lights are all in working order and the wires are constantly shorting and blowing the fuse. At the present time I have had to splice the wires several times and now the motor in the figure doesn't have the power to lift the Santa up or down the ladder so I now have a ""static"" Santa display.If you buy this product I wish you better luck than I've had.Merry Xmas."
1,"CAUTION: Kipor 3000 Blown Motor, No Warrantee","Wish I had a better experience... I bought a brand new Kipor 3000 and within 3 months and approximately 30hrs of use the motor blew.. I mean BLEW... Crankshaft and camshaft are in pieces... Buy the way, oil had been changed 3 times prior to engine failure...After contacting Kipor I was told since it was bought from a non-kipor retailer (wholesaler) they would not honor any warrantee. Kipor can not even provide me with information on where I could buy a replacement engine.. THEY HAD NO CLUE WHERE ONE COULD BE HAD. Amazing.Bottom line, if you buy from anyone that is not a Kipor retailer you have no support. and who would buy a generator that the engine self distructs this fast...At least Honda and Yamaha will cover product for one year regardless of where you bought the product. Pay the extra money and get a quality product with support. Mine is a boat anchor in my garage now..."
1,Kipor,"I bought my Kipor KGE300Ti 3 yrs ago,no problems,change oil often,use it to run our small cabin,then all the sudden it stopped generating,took it to where I bought it,,They dont sell or service them any more,,I ask Why,they said too expensive to repair,,If you got extended warranty,they couldn`t even get parts.My stator went out,windings came loose,,I found a new one,,,$549.00 plus labor,over $1000 to fix it So I guess these are Disposable.Save your little bit of money you save when buying this Kipor and get a YAMAHA or HONDA,,I got a YAMAHA and it came with a 4 yr warranty,and you and I know YAMAHA is going any where."
1,Chinese junk,"I wish I would have known before I bought it. You get what you pay for, and this seemed like a real bargain. You would think a 3000 watt generator for $800 would be a piece of junk. Well you would be right. The sales literature says it is one of the best selling generators in Europe. Of course the Yugo was a great seller there too. I didn't know it was Chinese when I bought it. That might explain the quality. It won't power a small microwave in a truck camper. It will actually start and run about 10% of the time. I've had the carburator apart many times to get it working again... for a short time. Now it seems to be an electrical problem. Of course no one in my city of 500,000 population will work on it. Most local generator companies haven't even heard of it. Want to save a few dollars? Buy a Honda or a Yamaha and save by having a quality machine that will last a lot longer."
5,Magnifico!,Excellent mix of Romantic Bolero and fast paced salsa/flamenco.. Both Romantics and modern dance music fanatics would enjoy this selecion.
3,David Bisbal brings a great sophomore cd,"David Bisbal's sophomore cd shows a more spanish influence than his debut cd. Standout tracks are ""Buleria"", ""Me derrumo"", ""Camina y Ven"", ""Desnudate Mujer"" and ""Esta ausencia"". This last song is one of the most beautiful ballads I've ever heard; Bisbal sings it beautifully. The other songs I don't like that much, but they're not terrible either. I see this young man having a long career in the music business"
3,"COMPLACIDO, PERO CUANDO BISBAL HARA ALGO GENUINO?","David Bisbal tiene mucho talento, pero ya aburre que sea un artista totalmente fabricado que solo aporta su voz y su apariencia en su trabajo. El deberia enfocarse en ser mas artista y participar mas en sus producciones y no sentarse a esperar que Kique Santander le haga los discos. Esta produccion es buena pero solo demuestra que es producto de un inteligente y bien estudiado marketing y que carece realmente de valor artistico. EN FIN, SI TE GUSTAN LOS DISCOS CORRIENTES Y NORMALES Y DE POCO TRACENDENCIA, ESTE ES EXCELENTE."
1,Strikingly bad.,"I am a flamenco guitarist who has played this art form on and off professionally for forty years. Buleria is a highly technical flamenco song from Jerez, Spain. This song does not appear on this album. What does appear on this album are a series of Negro-Caribbean rumba beats with a Latin-pop style synthesizer playing over it. Uber-tacky and having nothing to do with Buleria or the rest of flamenco that he is trading upon.Rename the album Go Go Latin Low Rider Music and it would be more accurate, don't add yourself to the list of people who wish they could play or sing flamenco, but don't have a clue how."
5,What an amazing voice!,I give 5 stars for the virtuosity of the singer. His voice has a range and a sound that is very impressive.But for the rest. The composition is good as well as the quality of musicianship. But nothing very out of this world.Still it's a very great CD. I like all the songs though they are very close to simple pop.
2,"Tacky music, tipical and overused sound, melodies, and production.","His voice is unbearable, and the choice of songs is truly hideous. If you like typical Latin Pop with no soul or reason to be other than commercialism, if you like Da Buzz, Britney Spears, Thalia, and so on, give this a shot, as it is as empty and I HAVE TO ADMIT - FUN, as the others."
2,You've been waiting for it but wait longer,"This is a great opportunity for those of you who like to hear some live recordings of the Sex Pistols with Sid Vicious but you're going to be dissapointed. The first disc is a compilation of studio recordings, a few of them are from Nevermind the Bollock's but some of them from older recordings and also a new version of Submission. There are also some excerpt from a radio interview in San Francisco. The second disc is of course, the Winterland Concert of January 14, 1978. Unfortunately, God Save the Queen is cut and all the dialogues with the audience too. Rotten wasn't in good shape that night and with all that's missing, it isn't worth it. I expect better from the Sex Files I."
3,Watchable,"Mmm...if you don't have anything better to watch, I think this movie was worth watching. I thought the story was acceptable. Wouldn't give it much more than that, though. I also thought the acting was for the most part poor but I thought the visual artistry - composition, color, photo/video quality - was decent and I didn't mind the special effects, which I guess were done with a comparatively low budget. I mean, I've seen much better, of course, but to me the effects weren't bad enough to detract from the story."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Ok lets start off by saying I love SYFY but only if the acting is good, and OMG my nephews act better than these people( note i didn't call them actors). The budget on this film was ok, its the acting that I couldn't get past the first 15min. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY"
1,Refund Please!,OMG! I just hope and pray that i never see another lame production like this again. They could have actually donated the production funds for this movie to the homeless!
2,Stale Goods,"I purchased this item several times, and at first the product was well within its expiration date and tasty. On the last order, however, the product was shipped AFTER its expiration date and was stale and inedible. Very disappointing inattention to detail and I had to throw away the entire shipment. Won't be ordering food products from Amazon again."
1,Tedious Perturbations,"This is an expanded version of an earlier text by the second author (Cole). The latter was clearly written, to the point, and a useful resource. The same cannot be said of this book. It obscures the ideas underlying perturbation methods with excessive detail on problems of marginal interest. It also, oddly, fails to adequately explain a fundamental method such as multiple scales. Their explanation of how and why scales are selected misses the point completely. This is odd as the authors made contributions to the early development of this method and, as pointed out by the other reviewer, this is the main focus of the book. I would not recommend this book, even as a second or third text on the subject."
3,Hard to read,"This book arrived on time and in the condition promised. I had heard some good reviews about this book, but found it to be a hard read. I'm not sure it could have been said another way, but for me, it was too hard to keep my attention."
5,You'll never view TV the same way again,"I read this book in 1991, and it changed my life. Since I ditched my TV in 1986, I decided to see if I was crazy or not. Mander's book assured me that I was not. After reading this book, you'll never be able to watch TV without a critical eye. You'll realize the ""falseness"" of it all. This is a MUST read, and should be required reading in our schools. Why not? After all, it only presents ""the other side"" to what most consider ""normal""; watching TV."
5,A FIFTH ARGUMENT FOR THE ELIMINATION OF TELEVISION,"For anyone who has read Mander's book with appreciation, I would heartily recommend Henri Nouwen's book, THE WOUNDED HEALER as a probing follow-up. The book is not focused on TV as such, but it paints a vivid picture of the conditions of our tech-driven society that has led to the corruption that has eaten the heart out of this society, and by consequence, infiltrated television programming,which simply mirrors the corruption of the society that produces it. Nouwen, in fact, quotes Mander's book in another of his (i.e., Nouwen's)books: GRACIAS!:A LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL(pg.30). But again, the best follow-up to Mander's book is definitely Nouwen's earlier work: THE WOUNDED HEALER, which could well be sub-titled: ""How we ended up in the mess we are in today."" Robert Durback Cleveland, Ohio"
2,When Bad Authors Happen to Good Ideas,"Alright, I hate television as I'm sure most of you do if you are looking into buying this book. Unfortunately this 350 page book is a complete waste of time.From the title I expected to see Four ARGUMENTS. Instead each argument turned out to be nothing more than pointless rants.After drudging through the first two sections, I really had my hopes up for the third, ""Effects of Television on the Human Being."" Again, I was sadly mistaken. I found myself laughing out loud as the author dictates his adventures in researching this topic only to find out that there is no evidence relating to TV!Don't get me wrong TV [is bad], but this is definitely not the book to reaffirm you're beliefs or ARGUE for the removal of television. Save your money!"
2,A dissenting voice: it's not REALLY about television,"Jerry Mander has a lot of convincing arguments in this book. However, most of them are not really about the harmfulness of TV. The real title of this book should be _Four Arguments for the Elimination of Capitalism_. Most of the specific anti-TV arguments are spurious and fantastic. I hear that David Bianculli's _Teleliteracy_ presents the other side effectively (unfortunately, it's out of print)."
1,"Awful, shallow book","It actually presents many examples of lousy television. It presents no arguments or compelling facts that indicate television should be eliminated. The title is great, the arguments are poor to non-existent. Should TV be done better? Sure. Would it be helpful to put the emphasis on quality instead of profit? Sure. Eliminated? This book isn't going to convert anybody but may be comforting to people who already feel that way. What a waste of time. Almost as bad as Postman's ""Amusing Ourselves to Death."""
1,This is insane,"Television is the only thing I have to look forward to, my life is sad and depressing and oh god I am going to cry *** :( Get rid of television? are you insane?, how else would you get the children to shutup"
5,I love this book,"I bought this book new a few years after it came out. I have re-read it many times and never forgotten the ideas presented in it. As a testimony to the strength of Mr. Mander's arguments, my husband and I gave up broadcast television two years ago and have found a whole new and better world--reading. I never realized how much I missed reading, but now when I want diversion, I have an open book on the back of the sofa which I return to. Much more satisfying than television.I agree wholeheartedly with Mander's premise--a world without television would be a much better world."
3,Wimpy mounting brackets,"I installed it by mounting to the frame rather than the rocker panel using self threading bolts I obtained elsewhere. I was worried about the sheet metal of the rocker panel being strong enough. The loop looks and functions well, but the mounting brackets seem wimpy for their purpose.The back portion should be reinforced or maybe some creases added to increase rigidity. The only flex in the system once they are mounted is at the back of the mounting brackets."
2,Buyer beware,The original versions of these hits were pretty much mastered to perfection on their original albums. This collection was somewhat of a disappointment (with just a few exceptions) from even my first listen. It should be clearly labeled as a remix collection. Any ear familiar with these hits from this late great artist will quickly recognize that these versions sound way different the originals.
2,Buyer beware!,"If you're a purist, don't buy this! The majority of the songs on this CD are remixed to sound more ""electric"", I guess so they'll sound more palatable to folks who only know his music from his mid- to late-80s phase. Classic songs like ""Clues"" and ""Sneakin' Sally..."" should not be tampered with. Don't be fooled!"
3,NOT THE BEST ROBERT PALMER COLLECTION,"First,I must take issue with the reviewer who denigrates Palmer as a partier chasing the almighty dollar.This is very unfair to an artist whose overall quality of work easily rivals Joe Cocker or Rod Stewart.To me,he was more like a latter-day Bobby Darin,his stylistic changes being fueled by a love for all kinds of music,as long as he felt some soul in it.This collection,however,dosn't showcase this as well as the recently released ""Robert Palmer The Very Best of the Island Years"".On that cd-which has 23 selections,almost half written or co-written by the man himself,including his biggest hits-he covers flawlessly Lowell George,Todd Rundgren and Lennon-McCartney.Get that one and you'll realize his legacy.Peace,Robert,wherever you are."
5,Title says it all,"If you are a Robert Palmer fan this should be in your collection. He does the best ""Bang a gong, get it on"" ever - better than the original. Two different ""Addicted to Love"" cuts on this CD."
5,A Must Have for any Collection,"Great Artist from England that really has a unique rock and roll pop sound. If you love singing in the car whiledriving, you got to get it. Lot's of fun, very tight performances."
2,very average,the remixing here is one of the problems.the other problem is that Robert Palmer is a Low budget take on Boz Scaggs&Neil Diamond.most of his music leaves me empty.much Like Michael Bolten&Rod Stewart he thinks he is being Soulful but it isn't even close.he is a better songwriter than anything else.his material is catchy more than anything else.
1,Just one good song,"Lets face it, Robert Palmer started off his career respected and poor and wound up mediocre but wealthy.He gave up and sold out. Listen to ""Johnny and Mary"" for what might have been.Oh Faustus."
1,WTF???????,"Sorry man, I really dig Robert Palmer, but this ""Best Of"" CD should be retitled the worst-mix of Robert Palmer. These versions of his solo ""hits"" would make him turn in his grave. There was no need to re-do any of his songs and LP cuts. Like I said, Robert Palmer is an amazing artist. Too bad this record company reunion a what would have been a great collection. R.I.P. Sir Robert."
1,Very Weak B Movie!!!!,"Well, let me first start off by saying that this movie could have been alot better if the company would have shelled out more money for better actors. The story in itself was okay, but the acting by EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE, WAS 100% HORRIFIC! I don't know where they picked these guys up from, but I could find better actors on the street. Upon reading some reviews of others on Youtube and Amazon, I see that the movie also starred a couple of youtube video reviewers by the name of MJ Kelly, and Shawn Phillips. Okay, well that pretty much says it all. What normal person cast youtube personalities to star in a film? These 2 guys tried their best, which is all good and well....but you can see that they have no originality to their style. MJ Kelly has an acting style of Andy Dick and Shawn Philips, tries really hard to imitate Chris Farley. They gave it a shot, but I really dont forsee any actors in this movie, having any career. Just my opinion"
1,Amateur Night,"Amateurish at best. The fat chubby guy seems to try to hard, kills the movie. shawn phillips is his name i believe horrible actor. he killed this movie. his loudness hurt my ears had to fast forward his parts cuz his voice gave me a headache."
1,Sasquatch,The movie itself is horrible. That's just my opinion. I honestly just bought it bc my boyfriend worked on it through synthetic cinema.
3,Another Sasquatch feature,"When I learned of the release of ""Assault of the Sasquatch"" I was really looking forward to seeing it. I have become a devotee of these Big Foot films and the promo sounded interesting and different with its ""Assault on Precinct 13"" derived plot. Now that I have watched the movie, I must admit that my hopes were a little dashed by this one. The production values are on the low end even for a Z-movie which this obviously is. Not sure that the right balance was struck between humor and horror as this one is too preposterous to be taken even a little bit seriously and at the same time misses with a lot of its humor. I gave the movie three stars as it managed to hold my interest and earned a chuckle here and there. As others have noted, if you like SyFy original movies or even the occasional Asylum ""mock-buster"" give this one a try. The music video included as a bonus feature merits a peek here as well."
1,"Reaganite propaganda, the roots of Iraq; reality will differ",what's real sad is those war criminals like Negroponte who were behind this crime against humanity are now in charge in Iraq. One now returns as Bush's ambassador to Nicaragua to foment further disasters there. See here the lies of papa Bush.
1,The old trap,"Once again, someone who loves Chaucer and does not comprehend that the personae in Chaucer's poems are not Chaucer but does operate out of the old intentional fallacy."
4,Fine Tape!,"As the previous review suggests, this tape is probably not for packing. But it's the size I expected - and the tape rolls are actually thicker than I thought. I'm happy with this product!"
4,Good gear-marking tape for climbing,"I use this tape to mark my climbing gear so it doesn't get mixed up with my friends' gear. Since it's climbing gear that I'm marking, the tape routinely gets scraped against rocks, rubbed by nylon runners that are loaded with body weight, and generally subjected to lots of abuse. So far, it's proved to be more than a match for the task - Most of the tape markings on my gear are holding up surprisingly well.I'd recommend this tape for anyone looking to keep track of their outdoor gear on group trips - it really does work well."
4,Multicolors help identify as well,"good tape, but i love the colors, very helpful in quickly identifying what has been taped. There's so much tape, it's lasted a long time, too."
2,SHOULD HAVE READ REVIEWS,"As stated on another review, this tape is not duck tape. When seaching for DUCK TAPE on Amazon this tape came up in the search. Asuming that the search would bring up something correct, I did not read as carefully as I should have. You know what they say about asuming.... I bought this tape for my kids to do crafts. Happy Valentines Day! Here is some electrical tape."
4,good except for packaging,"the product is good, but the packaging took forever to take apart. the rolls were stuck to each other, and i had to use the blade of scissors to separate them. very messy."
5,OMG!!!,THIS IS THE BEST KIDS SONG I HAVE EVER BOUGHT FOR DECADES.LOTS OF SONGCLEAR VOISES AND SMOOTH LANGUAGE. SIMPLY THE BEST I HAD TO BUY MORE FOR GIFTS. AND LEFT ONE IN THE CAR COS MY DAUGHTER WON'T LISTEN TO ANY OTHER THING.I LOVE IT.
4,4 and 1/2 stars.,strap on a pair of headphones and let this disc take your head for a spin. take a journey into a strange territory of sound. sounds ranging from majestically beautiful to just plain goofy. it's all good. it moves it grooves it inspires the soul it disorients expectations nestled in your aural center. highly recommended.
2,Might have been good then.... pretty average today,"I bought this CD completely on the back of these rave reviews without previewing it, and while I don't regret the purchase, I cannot see what the fuss about it. Back in the early 90s, this stuff may have been quite amazing, but in 2004, it sounds plain dated. It has the production, but no energy. 1st track is great, but the rest of the album pretty much washes over me.... I am big fan of this genre of music, and really gave this album a try, but to my dissapointment, it just bores me."
2,Is one or even 2 worth it???,Well when i bought this CD it was because i had heard the song The Song Of Life in Tomb Raider and it was good and let me tell you that this was an upset to me when i bought it ..I had been expecting more!!! :-( Its not bad its just not my style! .... Oh well live and learn
5,"excellent mix of ambience, dance and hip-hop","Music written ahead if its time is what can be said for this fantastic collection of fast and slow trance, with an excellent guest performance by none other than jonny rotten from the sex pistols in track 10(open up) one of the more popular albums over here in Ireland that doesnt have shamrocks and leprecauns, 5 stars doesnt give it justice."
5,"Essex, the heart of real talent?","What is it about Essex in the UK that makes me feel like the true UK artistes come from there,Leftfield, Empirion,The Prodigy, Underworld and Twelvetrees (i think). Five of my now favorite acts on this planet (just got 'boy on a cloud' by Twelvetrees.......EXCELLENT!!!!!!) all come from more or less the same area, and they all sound great live too (haven't seen Underworld 'live' yet).....maybe i need to move there for some inspiration....anyone got a spare room?"
5,Listen with pleasure,"One of THE definitive dance albums of all time. Leftism provides some of the most deftly crafted tunes in all areas of dance, from ambient- through house and techno and finally reaching chunky tribal drum and bass. The percussion background and expertise of this duo is in obvious effect, from the uplifting Song of Life to the unstoppable Space Shanty. Buy it or die."
5,Spellbinding,"This is a gem of a gift to oneself or others, which I purchased after encountering a copy at the home of my graphic artist friend, Lisa Zamarin. Other reviewers have talked about its remarkable content. Ingeniously consistent with the matchbook-cover-art it presents are the small, square format and box-like binding. Rather than in traditional signatures, the publisher had Matchibako bound accordion style (in heavy stock), so the first part of the book is read from front to back while the second part moves from back to front. Or the pages can be spread out in a panoply, a traditional Asian style. And such a tactile delight to ""play"" it, just like I play my real accordion!"
4,Great songs to listen to when you wanna relax,"Pride - Album made together with the hit-makers Jonas Bergren (Ace of Base) and John Ballard. Wow they made a strong album because all the songs are good, the best in my opinion is ""Show me Love"" it is a strong song. Most of the songs are slow but still good. Marie and Linda's NICE voice makes this album strong. I think anyone would like this album."
1,"Lasted 8 months, warranty a smokescreen, buy something else","Bought this in October of 2010, battery got weaker & weaker within 3 months, finally crapped out by June. Had it on a recommended trickle charger & disconnected when not in use. Vehicles charging system was confirmed as being fine. Contacted seller at Bluegrass & they were very helpful but Optima demands that I spend $50 to ship back to seller when there is a local dealer near my house. I complained to Optima, they suggested I do a 10A fast charge to resucitate , which I did, & the case split within 15 minutes even though the battery never got hot. Then they have the gall to say that a split case is not covered under warranty. The el cheepo Walmart battery I'm using as a replacement has already outperformed the Optima piece of junk. Optima's 3 year ""warranty"" is nothing but a marketing ploy. Save your money & buy from someone who stands behind their products."
1,Plastic red top cracked within 6 months!,"The plastic red top cracked within 6 months of buying the battery. It took several attempts via email and phone to get hold of Optima customer service. And when I took it to their distributor 30 miles away, they wouldn't warranty it. Never buying another Optima battery again."
5,Destined to be a classic!,"Using anger as fuel for humor is a time-honored comic tradition, and this witty, easy read will have you laughing at yourself, and putting it all into a much needed perspective. Congratulations, Aaron Naparstek, for showing us that the way to deal is to be real, rather than rageful!A little Zen cool is a much needed antidote to today's overheated rhetoric."
5,Take your magic performance to another level,"I love this book.It talks about how to approach your magic as an artist.It gives practical guidelines for you to follow and it tells you when you should not follow the guidelines.I must admit this book may not be for every one. The language is a bit dated and may require a little work on the readers part before the meaning becomes clear. There are many who may not like what the book says because it challenges the magician to work harder at their craft, If you want to improve and to stand out in this field this book is a great guide if you are willing to put work and time."
3,Okay,Don't see any benefit so far over Cat 5 cable. I don't have time to write extensive reviews on everything I buy.
1,Drivel,"This is quite honestly one of the worst publications I have ever seen. For a product that is supposed to support education, I was amazed at the typos, grammatical errors and otherwise banal writing. I also did not appreciate the personal banter from the editor regarding internal publication issues.Makes good fire starter on a cold winters night though."
5,Love it!,This has been our first yr hs. I did my research before hand and Practical Homeschooling was very informative and helpful! I Loved the fact it was Christian based and provided information based from that perspective of homeschooling and raising kids. I would definitely recommend this magazine for updated info and helpful articles!
5,Love it!,"I have been subscribing for several years now. I always find interesting and useful articles, different points of view, and food for thought. It is well put together. A great resource!"
3,Funky,"I am a big NTM fan. However, this is the album I like the least because it's not as ""hardcore"" and fast as the other ones. Nevertheless, it's my girlfriend's favorite NTM album! she loves it because it's got funky beats."
4,A breakthrough in the French rap industry!,"This is a big slap for the French music cliches! Please check out the ""Freestyle"" song! the bad sings w/ another hardcore band called ""ASSASSIN"". The song is fun, fast, and original!"
4,Bike Nerd Heaven,"As Miss Jean Brodie said, ""For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like."" She meant it as an insult, but I don't. Bicycling Science is nerd heaven, full of physics, engineering, molecular biology, aerodynamics and all kinds of other scientific manna. If you have an appetite for charts, graphs, and research studies, then this book will delight you with its explanations of why bikes work so well with the human body.It's not casual reading by any means. I'd prefer the same information presented in slightly less academic tones, but that doesn't mean it isn't accurate or interesting. So I dip into my copy for short bursts. For me, it's not a cover-to-cover read, but it's been on my bedside table for months because I pick it up regularly.Bicycling Science may well be more technical info than a casual fan can absorb. However, it's a great reference that will demystify your bike -- if that's the sort of thing you like."
4,good basic bicycle history and information,"This book is just what I hoped it would be with a lot of good information for anyone interesed in the bicycle world. It goes into every detail of the reasons for the development of the design of the modern bicycle.thank you,Robert W Logsdon"
1,Unpardonable Error,"Unfortunately, my copy of edition 3 fell open to page 81, in which the author compares forces from a piston engine to forces generated by living tissue. Unfortunately, this type of comparison is often completely invalid, particularly when the force is accompanied by zero motion in the direction of the force. For example, if the combustion force is replaced by a highly compressed spring, and if the crank is balanced exactly at top dead center, the spring will never ""get tired"" of exerting its force. In contrast, a human leg WILL get tired, even though no motion occurs. This is because chemical energy is consumed to exert the force even in the absence of motion.Unfortunately, with this single unreasoned comparison that drives to the core of bicycling science, the author has shot himself in the credibility foot, leaving all else he has to say in question."
3,Well done,"You can go pretty deep into this book...a lot of science of course, but great historical information on cycling, physiology, nutritional aspects of performance. More of a book that is a reference for deeper thinking readers."
3,A bit much for me,"Whereas Sheldon explains everything so you can understand it, this book seemed like it was too indepth. No disrespect to the author, it was just too much information for me to ""grab and go"" on the topics I wanted to learn about. For now I'll stick to Bicyclings guide to bikes."
1,Frustrated by this book,"This book is a lot like A child called it which is frustrating for me because the subject matter is so serious. It is difficult to take away an enduring message when a book reads like the manuscript of a teenager.When you have a story to tell and you are not a writer, the thing to do is have someone else write it for you.I am choosing my words carefully because I don't want to diminish the importance of the subject matter.Obviously, this book was therapeutic for Matthews, but I don't know if it should have been published in its current state.As a reader, I felt the same way about Peltzer's book. As a teacher, I am torn about such heavy subject matter written on a fourth grade reading level. If the target audience is teens, that is fine. If the audience is adults, then it should be written in a more appropriate style.With subject matter like this, I'm afraid you can't have it both ways."
5,The Book Was Great - But . . .,"I happened to see two different versions of this book. The first was a borrowed copy from someone on my job. I dont know who the publisher was, but they really made the Author look bad. Then I happened to meet the author at an event in DC and bought the revised copy for my daughter. There was a two hundred percent turn around in the two books! The story was absolutely terrific - especially the second time around. I applaud the author for helping us to see situations like this more clearly. The story was beautifully and wonderfully told!"
3,EYE OPENER,"I am so glad that I read this book. At first I found it very depressing but just to know that there are many ""Tasha's"" out there made me eager to finish the book. I can only symphathize. I have a young daughter and I soon as I read this book I made sure we talked about some of the issues in the book. I don't understand how a mother could turn her back on their child under those circumstances and refuse to believe what they are trying to tell them. Kim, I say even though this is a subject that most people don't want to discuss, you keep putting the stories out there because someone will gain awareness and be able to help someone who may be in that situation."
3,A Must Read for all Parents!,"This story will grab you immeadiatly but not like you expect. The story is told by a child who was simply a child that was abused in a way no child should have to suffer but so sadly many do. All parents should especially those of us who've suffered this and similar abuse...we vow not to do it, but when you've been abused you still abuse on some level,we all must read and truly do some soul-searching, evaluate ourselves, watch the words that come out of our mouths. And for those who've suffered this nightmare in there life PLEASE TELL SOMEBODY! when you tell...someone will help you and the healing will begin. Kimberly Matthews thank you for your work. I pray for the silence to stop."
2,sad story,"I was not a fan of this book. Not that it was not well written, or that the story wasn't told well - just the opposite. It was too graphic and of such a horrible crime! It left many unanswered questions too......I feel for the victim of this book."
4,sad but true...,This book brings out what really happens to children in their own homes and most people are never aware or take time to notice those little clues..
4,Quick read,This book is an eye opener it sheds light on the state of dysfunctional households all over the country. On how people can abuse their children and control them. It's an interesting how at the end the sisters both compare memories and how very different they are. Memories are something to tread lightly upon as they can trigger adult trauma and reopen old wounds.
1,NOT the original versions!,The song list is great - but these are not the versions we used to hear on the radio! Very disappointing.
4,Great Filter - But,"Bought this for an RX330. Great filter, nicely made and looked at least equal quality to the OEM Denso Toyota filter. I would have given this a 5 stars but one minor annoyance - no up/down/forward arrows on the filter. Seems like such a minor thing they could have stamped on this filter but they didn't. Fortunately, the original filter had an up and front of car arrow so I was able to look at the two filters and line up the wix in the same orientation. There is a direction to this filter but you would not have known that without the original. Other than that this is a 5 star and much cheaper than having the dealer install it!"
5,Just as good as oem..if not better,"Installed just like the original. Material seems comparable, if not better than stock. Just remember, there are no markings on this to show orientation....so just compare it to the original. Went in with no problem...2008 highlander."
1,Doesn't fit 2004 Lexus RX330 like Amazon states it will,"Contrary to Amazon's info, the correct Wix p/n for a 2004 Lexus RX330 is 24905. I guess I'll have to go through the hassles of exchanging it."
1,Does not fit 2009 Toyota Camry,"This is listed as fitting a 2009 Toyota Camry 2.4L. It does not fit. It's about an inch too long. The correct air filter is 49223. Amazon, please fix this."
4,Family Fun,"I'm a bit prejudiced since both I and my Aunt Virginia contributed data to the author but I like the book. It is as complete a family history of the Parslows in America as exists. While some updating is no doubt necessary, I believe it to be fairly correct through the date of publication."
3,Not bad,"Okay, so i only gave it three stars. But i don't only review music i love. I do love Bettie Serveert. On Dust Bunnies they seem to have been listening to a lot of late-era Pavement. There is more of a ""country"" jangle and a swagger in Carol's voice. She tries to be Stephen Malkmus and she doesn't have to. How many people can do the deadpan delivery?There is the good influence of the Velvet Underground and also some killer songs. ""Geek"", ""Rudder"", ""Co-Coward"" are some of their greatest. But i get the feeling that the band is shunning the success that so eludes them. Listen to ""Rudder"" and you'll see what i mean: they almost kill a great song that is ironically about ""Everybody loves a band that sells.""I saw this tour and it was nothing short of amazing. But this album falls short of their capabilities."
4,Great Book,"This is a great story about justice in a forgotten city, destroyed by an earthquake and overun with crime Batman and several others try to bring justice. This story alternates points of view many times through out the story from Batman to Penguin and everyone in between. Action and adventure fill the story with few dull moments through out it.This story isn't a tough read and once you get into it its hard to put it down. The book can be confusing at times with all the different points of view but than again that is also what makes the story so interesting. The story is told from the first person by all of the many characters. Batman along with Batgirl and what is left of the Gotham Police Deparment fight villians such as Two Face, Penguin, Poisen Ivy and many more. It is a great read and i higly suggest it."
5,Batman No Mans Land,This book was awesome. Greg Rucka takes you inside NO MANS LAND with the other characters. He shifts off from just Batman so you get a well rounded view of the thoughts of NO MANS LAND. I just wish there was another book out there like this one. You Will love this book if you are a BATFAN.
5,A World Without Batman,"With the modern love of all things batty this story from Gotham brings some of the finest characters of the cities elite together in the aftermath of a terrible tragedy. An earthquake has split the city, the world has abandoned it, and so to, has Gotham's pointy eared defender. Joining heroes, villains, and the citizens of Gotham Greg Rucka takes us on a wonderful story about the triumph of the human spirit, the strength of a city, and the power of who we place our trust in. A stunning read in both comic and novelization and well worth an addition to any fan's collection."
4,Great!,"They should novelize comic book stories more often! After reading the Infinite Crisis novel, I searched for more ""comic to novel"" adaptations. So I check this out... Man, am I glad I did!"
4,Shadow of the Night,"Batman No Man's Land is a great book to read, unless you hate short chapters and multiple characters. Greg Rucka does a good job in keeping the readers attention and keeps the reader guessing with a suspenseful thought of mind."
2,"Over, use, of, commas!","Holy commas, Batman!Rucka has this tendency of overusing commas to the point that you feel you might want to reread his text just in case you missed something, that can be tiresome, after reading the 'No Man's Land' saga in comic book form, I had to force myself to finish this novelization, on a side note, the binding exploded mid-read, and that has never happened to me, ever before.Does my comma usage annoy you? At least Rucka's usage is grammatically sound, but nevertheless, this, novel, will, grate, on, every, last, nerve, that, you, possess."
5,A wonderful book!,"I was very pleased with Mr. Rucka's adaptation of the No Man's Land Saga. He pulled together a lot of story elements and created a wonderful narrative. I particularly enjoyed the ""excerpts"" from Barbara Gordon's journal. You don't have to be a fan of comics to enjoy this novel, but if you like Batman, you'll truly appreciate Mr. Rucka's contribution to the mythos."
5,Great!,This is a great book. If you are a Batman fan it is a must read. The way the author can convey the personalities of these psychotic villians and also convey the mystery and stealth of the Batman is fantastic. And the story of No Mans Land where Gotham turns into a lawless city cut off from civilization is a fresh new take on the Batman stuff i have read. I highly recomend.
5,good service,"arrived quickly, packaged well, item was for someone else, they were pleased with item, easy to do business with, would purchase from them again"
4,A solid interpretation of a solid comic story,"Greg Rucka fantastically handles the entire ""No Man's Land"" story line from DC Comics in this adaptation. Eliminating only a few side events from the comic story, Rucka weaves a spectacular tale that interprets the Batman's rogues gallery and supporting cast in a human and sometimes horrifying manner especailly when dealing with the Joker and Two Face Characters. The story slowly builds to a pulse pounding ending that makes the last one hundred pages of the novel go buy so quickly that you may find yourself reaching for a glass of water and a towel to wipe off your head when your finished reading."
5,One of the best books,"Batman: No Man's Land, is one of the best books I have ever read. When I bought the book, I had no idea there was even a comic about the same thing. I bought it because I love Batman and I figured a novel would be a great thing to read. I am glad I chose to read this and if you love Batman this is a great piece of writing to read. And if you don't love Batman, this book may change your mind. Greg Rucka deserves a prize!"
3,Well....3.5 stars maybe,"A perfectly servicable adaptation of the epic Batman story. To its credit it manages to clarify plotlines while abandoning the need to include everything under the sun (gone is the Scarecrow storyline, for example). The story moves along well, and each of the man characters seems to get their due. If there is a flaw to this book, and it's not a flaw per-se, it's that the book doesn't really allow us to get to know any of the characters better. The best adaptations have the room to explore the psyche of the protagonists and antagonists. This is a more plot-driven novel, and one imagines the powers-that-be at DC have restricted his ability to do too much exploration. We might miss Elliot Maggin, but Mr. Rucka has nonetheless crafted one of the best adaptations and comic-book novels in some time."
1,Defective construction...,"I purchased this bag for its versitility and rugged construction. It worked great for my limited travel until my last trip. The metal shaft of one clip broke while I was walking through the airport. To me, this is an obvious defect. I was wearing it as a backpack at the time and had to carry it by the bag's top handle. It's still usable that way, but as a woman, I want a strap and prefer the backpack configuration for even weight distribution.Although the bag is roomy and has lots of compartments, it's not light even when empty, so I didn't load it down. Without the use of the strap, it's now useless and Amazon's return policy for defective products is really bad once you pass the 30 day return policy window. I've had the bag 4 months and used it during 4 business trips to carry my laptop, iPad and miscellaneous cords and connectors.I would not recommend this bag. The defect in the rotating clip shaft makes it unreliable and a poor value."
2,Too big for my bum,"I'm not quite 5'3"" and this bag looked utterly ridiculous on me because of the size. I liked the amount of pockets, but really there are better options out there. I bought a Skooba after this one, and returned it as well. Finally, I've landed on the Booq Mamba - less pain than a shoulder bag, sleeker and sexier than the bumbackpack, and the best organization I've found so far. I use it for laptop, book, peripherals, moleskine, water bottle, and other sundries."
5,Great for my back and perfect for my laptop/ipad,"Boy did my back thank me after purchasing this bag. I spend about 3 hours a day wearing a bag as I commute to work and before getting this bag I experienced constant pain in my lower back (I have a slightly herniated disc). Not to mention, the messenger bag that I was using was killing my right shoulder and I knew that years of usage wouldn't be beneficial for my back. What I love about the Hamptons Hybrid bag is that it evenly distributes the weight across your back rather than place pressure on one concentrated area. It's an extremely durable bag, with lots of padding and pockets too...perfect for my laptop, ipad, ipod etc...I've already gotten a few compliments from strangers off the street."
5,I Love The Backstreet Boys,"This cd is probably one of their best cds. I thought that they really matured on this cd. I absolutely loved all of the tracks on this cd and when my friends heard it they loved it too, and went out and bought it. This really is a wonderful cd."
3,Better than rap,"This is the cd that we have..enhanced too, but our cd has 12 songs, the additional one being ""Anywhere for you"". I guess the Canadian Release is different. I'm not a great fan of the BSB's, but at least they're better for kids and teens to be listening to, than rap and Marilyn Manson type stuff. Good dance beats and harmless lyrics make for a pretty good album."
1,doesn't even deserve one star,"the backstreet boys arejust a washed-up bunch of gay studio-made freaks that make money to take off their shirts on MTV. they don't even deserve one star. and i am getting sick of all this ""ooohhh, i love nick he is so cute!"" and all this cra*. and as for the CD, it sucked! they can't sing people, they don't even look that good. you BSB fans all have two things in common- you don't have a life and you don't have a date! ha!"
2,This is RIDICULOUS!,"Why did I say this was ridiculous? Because these spoiled brats and all those other teen-pop artists have enhanced CDs, and much better talented stunts like Phil Collins, Stevie Wonder, and especially Andrea Bocelli can't get one! I'll leave Christina Aguilera out of this. At least SHE can sing.Dear Backstreeters, you ought to get it going on with Andrea Bocelli, which I very much doubt you will."
5,Greatest CD to ever Hit The Stores!,"Backstreet Boys' Millenium was the greatest CD ever. You should buy it. Now, u can rush to the store and get it. THats all I have to say! GO BUY THE CD ALREADY! Your wastin time!"
5,it is one of the best bsb cd's yet,i am in love w/ this cd i cant get enough . i hope every one loves it just as much as i did. i wish they could have released it in america instead of making it an im-port
5,AWESOME!!!,This is one of their best! The Backstreet Boys are the best and they have some of the best songs around today! Their CDs have the best songs on it! Keep the Backstreet Pride Alive!!!
5,this is a great cd!!,"i just bought this cd today. i am a huge bsb fan, and i love this cd! it has all the best songs from their first cd, and all of the other songs are really good. i love thats the way i like it, and if i dont have you!"
2,The second album by the sugaboyz,"A typical Boygroup-album. Songs about broken hearts and missing somebody and Bubblegum-Pop. But there are at least a few songs that are not that bad (""Everybody"", ""Like a child"", ""If I don't have you"" and ""As long as you love me""). I mean that melody is not that bad so that the songs aren't boring but the lyrics are just stupid.So if you like the five cuuute guys you'll love this album. If not: Stay away and don't touch it. This is just kitschy."
3,Great Light,this is a really great light if your only lookin for somthing to light up your keyboard and only your keyboard. It doesn't get hot like some lights do. It takes up hardly any space. But if you are lookin for a light to light up your desk area this isn't the light to buy.
1,flimsy junk,"Made of brittle plastic, they had to send a replacement because the first one they shipped was smashed and in pieces. The replacement worked for about a month then it was garbage."
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL,I hated this light. It was made cheaply and it shows. It fell apart for me the 2nd day I had it. I tried to adjust it and it just fell apart on the blue part. I just threw it away. I made up my mind I would tell anyone that before they wasted their money.
5,Great help for anyone with eye problems,"I have problems with my eyes and this lamp is perfect for lighting up my computer keyboard. I don't have to plug it in to my surge protector, as it only uses a USB port to power up. I would prefer that the on/off switch to be easier to operate, but overall I like this product."
