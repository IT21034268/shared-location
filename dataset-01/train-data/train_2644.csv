5,Storage Tip,"I don't own this particular model, but after reading comments about how tall and difficult to store some people find it, I thought that I'd share how I store my model. I just take the top off, turn it upside down with the feed chute pointing down and place it on top of the bowl.This greatly reduces the height and makes it much easier to store in a shorter space."
3,Food Processor bowl isn't made to last like Cuisinart!,"The bowl, top and plunger system developed stress fractures and cracks in less than a year of use. the polycoarbonate material they used in manufacturing is brittle. At the top of the bowl the fractures are such that it has made the use of the processer dangerous as I am afraid that pieces will break off and go into whatever Iam processing. I called the company and they said that parts would replaced if under a year old. I called just over a year as I had too many other things to do...I don't know if they will replace. I even offered to send the bowl so that they could see what the problem was. The replacement powls are about $40.00 plus shipping, so I am not happy that this might have to be a yearly thing. I never replaced my workbowl for cuisinart-worked fine for 15 years!"
4,Great product with few flaws,"Bought on sale for $129. Can't get anything this good for this price anywhere!We also own a 14 cup Cuisenart, and my wife likes this one better. Would give this one 4.5 stars but amazon doesn't allow 1/2 stars.The reason for the non-perfect score is that sometimes liquid or thin pastes can dribble into the stem area of the base. I.e., there isn't a perfect seal between the bowl and the base where the chopping blade is connected. Spillage is minimal (1 teaspoon or so), but it happens often and needs a small cleanup. Great product overall!Have also owned a Hamilton Beach processor in the past...unless you can't afford the more expensive models, only go with KitchenAid or Cuisenart!"
5,In Love with it,"I am absolutely in Love with my new Food Processor, it is perfect for small or big jobs. just perfect.at first I tried to chop the onions with the blades and it turned into soup, latter I figured out if I used the slicer disks , they will turn out great. I also use it with my Baby food, Perfect!!"
5,Thank goodness for reviews!,"I am so glad I read reviews first!. I had my heart set on the Cuisinart. After reading all the reviews, I decided to go for the Kitchenaid. This was a much obsessed over birthday present. Everything everyone has said is true! It is remarkably quiet, easy to use,easy to clean & I love that the accessories have a storage box included. It feels very heavy duty & well made. I also know from dealing with Kitchenaid in the past, they are an excellent customer service company. When I had something go wrong with my stand mixer, they sent out a replacement immediately & shipped the other one back with no problems. I was very impressed with how easy it was. I look forward to many years of fun with this machine."
5,Top Notch Food Processor,"This machine does it all. Our first endeavor was our cauliflower ""mashed potatos"". Our previous machine (recently purchased but smaller in size) could not handle pureeing the cauliflower, cream and butter mixture. Bits of cauliflower remained unprocessed giving us ""lumpy mashed"". This Kitchenaid does the job admirably. We can see the quality that went into this machine and are very happy with our purchase."
2,"great new but over a short time, not so hot","This machine was awesome for the first several months. Then the collar on the shaft broke and it's been downhill ever since. The bowl wouldnt lock down and the plastic part of the blade shredded. After the other nightmares I've had with KitchenAid in the past three years, this shouldnt have surprised me."
3,I wasted some money!,"I bought this as a present for myself with the intention of using it for cookie dough making. Well, that's not what I got! The info with the processor says it comes with a dough hook for mixing any dough, such as cookies, or breads. I tried using it for both and I am sadly dissapointed. The flour stays stuck all around the bowl and the hole in the middle is an irritation to clean when dough gets stuck inside. It doesn't mix the eggs in well, such as creaming all the ingredients. But, it does a heck of a job on chopping vegetables, or making cookie crumbs from the cookies I mixed BY HAND. I should have bought a much smaller processor for chopping and such, and then bought the stand mixer like I have wanted for years! Chad, if you read this, you gave me bad advice on this processor!!!!Amazon, looks like you will be receiving my order for a big red mixer soon!"
1,Walnuts broke my food processor!,"I purchased this food processor in 2007 because I was so happy with my trusty Kitchenaid mixer. My mixer broke the following year when I was blending dried, pitted dates along with walnuts to make a no-bake cake. The shaft for mounting blades and the blade both broke. Kitchenaid would not repair because I'd had the food processor for just over a year."
5,Great Helper,My last food processor was a Moulinex (European brand) and after 20+ years of service it gave up. I searched intensely and read all the reviews before settling for this food processor. I particularly wanted the processor to grate coconut meat. My old processor did this in a 2 step process. I first had to shred the coconut meat and then use the multipurpose blade to cut the shredded coconut into smaller pieces so it resembles grated coconut meat. I went through the same process with Kitchenaid and the coconut was minced so fine it looks as though it had been pureed. I ordered the parmesan/ice grating disc thinking if it could grate ice then it should grate coconut meat. The disc has not yet arrived and now I don't need it and can't cancel it. I am delighted with this purchase plus it is very quiet in operation.
2,Leaks flour all over counter,"I got this to replace a Cuisinart that I had for almost 10 years, and I am sending it back. The seal on the work bowl leaks when ever you pulse even small quantities of flour or liquid. If my busted up old Cuisinart didn't have that problem, I refuse to tolerate it in a brand new kitchen aid."
5,Great product,This is a great food processor. Lots of power and comes with enough accessories to get many jobs done.
4,"Good, but wish it was even better.","I bought this for my wife who has used this a few times now. I figured it being a Kitchenaid higher level item that it could do more than not. The instructions have me wondering if that's true. We'll continue to try new uses and see if it lives up to expectations. My advice to anyone thinking about buying a similar Kitchenaid food processor is to read the manual online b4 you buy to make sure it will do what you want/need it to do. It IS fairly quiet so that part of other reviews is accurate. Relatively simple to use, and seems like it's made well. Will know more as it's used more."
4,Kitchen Aid Food Processor,"I purchased this product to replace the Cuisinart I'd had for several years. This processor has a larger capacoity (12 cups) and has a larger foorprint. It comes with a mini bowl, which is very convenient. Generally I think the Cuisinart did a better job of chopping foods to a uniform size.I was making a cake which called for chopping chocolate very fine. I don't think the Kitchen Aid did as good a job of that as the Cuisinart would have."
3,Not great for soup,"I love having the smaller bowl for mincing garlic, ginger, jalapenos, etc. My only complaint is that the large bowl doesn't seal well and when we tried to puree a soup it turned into a pretty big mess."
5,KitchenAid KFP750 food processor a great product!,I love my new KitchenAid food processor. My old food processor (not a KitchenAid) finally broke and I bought this one based on Consumer Reports and the Amazon reviews. This food processor is very quiet. It does a great job at slicing evenly and makes fast work of shredding carrots. I'm not sure if I like the mini bowl. I used it once and didn't get good results. Also the spatula that comes with the processor has gotten a little frayed on the edges from the dishwasher. But I still gave this food processor 5 stars because I didn't buy it for the mini bowl or spatula. I bought it from Amazon at an excellent price and it had a $20 mail in rebate from KitchenAid.
4,Good Product,"I don't believe these are as good as the original Cuisinarts due to the design. As other reviews indicated you can't fill this machine up to what it advertises to be its full capacity. However, it gets the job done and I purchased it at a very good price."
3,Ok for the money ...I guess.,"This machine has all of the power you would expect from a KitchenAid, but I suspect there is a reason why the price was so good.It seems like all of the disc blades were made inside out... with the lip facing up. This causes a BIG gap between the blade and the lid causing a lot of unprocessed food to get caught inbetween.If I would have known I would have payed a little more for one in the store that I could have examined first."
4,Fast and easy to use,"I'm a rooky gadget user, and my husband is trying to get me to try new things. This was easy to use without a lot of buttons, and the parts assemble easily as well. I did have a little trouble figuring out which slicer was 2 mm and which was 4 mm...they aren't marked so you have to judge the thickness. I've used it to shred cheese and slice and puree vegetables, and it is extremely fast. The large bowl size worked well for the recipe I was using. I'm looking forward to the option of having the smaller bowl size as well."
5,powerful machine,I had a Cuisinart for eighteen years which was also very good but this one is much more powerful and precise. You have to be careful to put small quantities of food at a time as it processes so quickly and will turn things like raw potatoes to mush. Other than that it is an amazing machine that makes life so much easier.
1,"well designed, but beware of the plastic...","I purchased this machine after reading a glowing review in ""Cook's Illustrated"" and to replace an aged Robot Coupe. The design is excellent and well thought out. However, after just learning that the plastics, that come into contact with food, is made from polycarbonate that contains bisphenol-A (BPA) and I will be sending this back. This plastic is a synthetic hormone and has a possible link to some cancers and other serious health issues and a risk I am just not willing to take. This is plastic #7 should yo want to check it out."
1,cheap materials,This was way too expensive for the work bowl handle to break and the bowl and food pusher to have cracks after 2 years of medium use. Very poor quality and difficult to get replacement parts as they have changed the design at least 2 times in 3 years.
4,"Works great, but found it a little bit difficult to clean and maintain..","we have used this product for a little over a year. It works great, but we found it difficult to clean, especially when we prepare dough in it. The area where the top cap fits onto the main jar, it has lot of small slots and steps, where dough sits and you have to use fingure nails or good brush to clean it. But dough gets stuck in the brush and hard to remove. On the positive side, we love it when we use it to prepare mix for Dosa (Indian dish). We can prepare large amount of mmix in one shot and it does a great job.Overall its a great product, but with just two of us at home (me & my wife) we find it difficult to use it on daily basis for dough making or vegetable cutting because of messy cleaning. We prefer regular knife and cutting pad for vegetables and use this processor only for making doughs in large quantity (when we have guests) or dosa mix. May be with large families, it's worth it, I don't know."
1,blade stuck on the stem,"I bought this processor over 2 years ago. Today I was making mille feuille dough, which I have made many, many times, since I own this gadget, and to my surprise the blade would not detach from the stem. I tried everything I could think of, I searched on google and, yes some people had had the same problem I just had. I followed many of the hints in google and the blade still stuck on the stem. In fact after I pull the blade, the whole stem and small bowl came out of the unit. Now I have the stem attached to the small bowl with the blade still stuck on the stem!"
2,"Worked for a while, but has issues and bowl handle snapped off with light use","I bought this food processor a few years ago based on its decent reviews. I do not use a food processor often (about 1x per month) and assumed it would last a while. The first issue I had is that the blade assembly was very difficult to remove at times, but since I did not use it very often, I wasn't concerned. However, the last time I used it to dice vegetables, the top of the handle snapped off the bowl when I lifted the bowl off the base. I would not recommend this model for a frequent food processor user."
5,It's terrific and the customer support makes all the difference!,This processor is sturdy and grates cheese and processes things with ease. I just love it. It's more expensive than some of the less powerful models but I find that kitchenaid stands behind their products. One example. I lost the ring that goes on the meat grinder attachement to the kitchenaid mixer and they sent me another one for free! They didn't even charge me shipping. They don't antiquate their technologies so you can get parts for old equipment. I can't tell you how many food processers I have had to toss because one of the plastic parts got lost or broken. It's worth it to pay a little more. You have an excellent powerful mixer food processer and it will last a long time because the support is there. I asked myself - why did I wait so long to get one??
5,JUST AS GREAT AS AS MY OLD ONE,"When my old Kitchenaid processor's plastic mechanism that locks the lid in place finally wore out, I tried everything I could to get replacement parts. I could'nt find them anywhere so I bit the expensive bullet to buy a new one. Boy, do I love it! Kitchenaid has beefed up the interlocking plastic parts, so I expect this one to last longer than I will."
5,This thing is a beast.,"I wanted to save some time by using it to chop onions and carrots. It pulverized them! This was much larger/heavier than I expected. It's great if you have a large family, or a catering business. I definitely could have gone with a smaller machine, but I am not unhappy by any means. I expect to have a long-lasting relationship with the new monster in my kitchen."
1,Terrible Quality and Lack Lustre Customer Service,"I had a Cuisinart food processor prior to purchasing the KitchenAid. I've read all the reviews over the years (Consumer Reports, Cook's Illustrated) claiming that this is, by far, the best option on the market so I decided to purchase one. I've been through three food drums and each has had the handle and locking mechanism crack. It leaks when you have anything more than two cups in the 14 cup drum and it can't seem to handle cheese grating with the disc insert. This is my second bad experience with KitchenAid (a terrible French door refrigerator was another bomb). And the Canadian customer service was, at best, indifferent. If their market reputation is their calling card, they are DEFINITELY on the decline. I won't buy any products from KitchenAid in the future."
1,Wasted My Money,"My blender crapped out after 20 years and I thought I would replace it with a food processor. For my needs, a blender would have been a better purchase. The food processor is such a hassle with all the parts and figuring out what attachment to use that I rarely use it. It's just easier to chop things by hand and then you only have a cutting board and knife to clean up. Plus it takes up much more space on my countertop than a blender.After only about a month, the work bowl no longer made a good connection so the processor wouldn't work. Called Kitchen Aide and they said they would have to send me another. So far it hasn't shown up so I'll have to make another call.Just wish I had purchased a new blender and saved some $$$$."
5,KA foodprosser,"great price ! great product ! [ [ASIN:B0002MH3OC KitchenAid KFP750OB 700-Watt 12-Cup Food Processor, Onyx Black]]"
1,over-priced step backwards,"I the owned the previous top of the line Kitchen Aid model for 13 years. It was fantastic. This is far heavier, and taller, although not a larger capacity. There are only three discs instead of 6; on the older model they were reversible for different sized slicing or grating. On this model, you can only shred or slice one size and there is no crinkle cut. There is not even room for all of the blades in the storage container, so I have a super sharp blade floating around my kitchen that I keep cutting myself on. What do I do with it? Store it in the machine, so my children can turn it on and cut off their fingers??? This will be the first thing I have ever returned to Amazon."
1,Be Careful Buying KitchenAid Countertops Appliances!,"Be careful when purchasing a KitchenAid countertop applicance. They could well discontinue it whenever they like. That happened to me with an 11C food processor. So now they will ""offer"" me a 30% discount on a new one (at bust-out retail) - ridiculous - or tell me to pound salt. So $250 is now worth less than the bowl. They did't make them and they don't support the parts (i.e. bowls, lids) for them. So be careful. They may leave you stranded if you buy the wrong one!"
4,seems good,we have had our kitchenaid processor for several years and it's still working well. Seems to get the job done. Nothing has melted and we dishwasher clean it. Takes a little time to get used to how it fits together. Semi large item if you don't have much counter space.
2,Kitchenaid 750 - no thanks,"I bought this well-reviewed food processor, and now I see that I bought a bum deal. One of the reviewers hit the nail on the head when he stated that it was badly engineered. I agree. For many jobs you are confined to the small 4 cup bowl. This is simply not good enough. I bought a re-manufactured one. I guess you get what you pay for. Now I know why these machines were returned."
3,Great except ...,I really like this food processor with one exception. I didn't realize when I ordered it that it can only hold so much liquid. I recently made a soup like mixture in it and it worked great! Then I lifted the bowl off the unit and the soup went everywhere! I then read the manual and it said the water could not exceed 1/2 inch deep.Guess the soup was a job for the blender; my mini food processor could hold more liquid in it's bowl.I would probably send it back if I could.
4,Food Processor,"Anything that makes the wife happy makes me happy. I also, love the salsa it make in just a few minutes."
1,leaks like a sieve,"This thing is powerful, and looks good, but the bowl leaks like crasy... not through the base (which would be a user problem of overfilling it obviously) but through the LID JOIN! Liquids literally pour out pooling all around the unit. It is unbelievable how badly this thing leaks.Half these reviewers must never process liquidy things or else there would NOT be hundreds of 5 star reviews. BE WARNED!! THIS UNIT IS NOT GOOD!!"
4,Great Service,"""We had a couple of mishaps on the item being shipped. Truly a mispick on item. Carlys-place straightened everything out and all are happy. They were very polite and courteous."""
2,Oops,"I can only imagine how good this product would be if I didn't blow it up... Buyer beware if you are trying to plug it into Aussie 240 volt plugs, it will blow up your nice shiny processor.. I've learned my lesson!"
2,"dough blade stuck, spewed liquids","This processor is going back, dough blade fused. Kitchenaid itself agreed to replace the processor entirely, which is great. But perhaps I don't want this for making bread. Oh yeah, with as little as 1/2 cup of liquid in the machine, it spewed and leaked all over everything. I am pretty disappointed in this product. I have many other high-end KA products and am surprised."
4,Quality NOT you would expect from KitchenAid,"Great product, lots to extras and the reliability of KitchenAid you would expect. I plan to own this for years. Downside, the processor only has two settings, pulse pulverize and continuous pulverize.UPDATE: Product died Thanksgiving morning. Guess KitchenAid Reliablity isn't what it used to be."
4,Very good machine...enjoy the quietness,"I've had this processor for about three months. On the first day, I decided to make bread, and the dough blade suddenly stuck to the machine. When I called customer service to help me figure out what I did wrong, they told me that occasionally, this processor's dough blade fuses to the machine. I couldn't even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together. Fortunately, the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately. I received my second new processor, and tried to make cookies. This time, everything worked fine, and the machine is quiet. I can even talk on the phone when using this food processor. I'm just glad that they exchanged the first one so quickly!"
5,KitchenAid KFP750OB,"This is a very powerful and easy to use food processor. The only problem is that the bowl does have hard to clean crevices. After reading reviews of this food processor, I bought it regardless of this issue. I use an old toothbrush to clean out the crevices it works great."
4,Food Processor,"This is a great food processor and was a good bargain. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is a fantastic cook! She had it unpacked and in use the day after Christmas."
4,KitchenAid 12 cup food processor,"I love my food processor! ! I read all the reviews for weeks before I bought this one. i almost got the Cuisinart product, but it had terrible reviews. I use it at least 3 times per week. It is great because you have the option to use the smaller cup, and so easy to clean! I gave it 4 stars because I tried to shred a block of cheese with the disk and it didn't come out right (I may have used the wrong one, i plan to try again). Overall aterrific product, very sturdy and well built. Love the storage case it comes with!!"
4,Classy,"Love this processor. I've previously been a cuisinart girl but now I'm all about the Kitchenaid. On a superficial level, which suits me fine, it's a slicker more attractive beast but technically it's been faultless. I use it a lot and have had no issues so far, it's a lot less temperamental to turn on than a cuisinart and I'm a big fan of the small bowl that comes with it for chopping smaller items, it's a lot less hassle to clean out the little bowl than having to do the whole thing. That was pretty smart of them. I'm very happy with it and I can't think of anything bad to say really."
3,Dry and passionless performance,"As is typical of Dutoit's recordings, the sound quality is top drawer, and technically there is not a note out of place. Everything is perfectly in synch and in tune yet, for all that, this performance left me daydreaming and bored. The exposition of the first movement was completely lacking in drive, and the sense of architecture and contrast evident in Charles Munch's account is totally lacking here. But then, Munch's recording has its own problems, including the 1962 sound quality (average or below even for its day), occasional intonation problems, and generally weak brass playing. It is unfortunate that this piece is not recorded more frequently. In any case, the Dutoit version features an excellent brass section and modern sound. If you like his other recordings you will probably like this, but if you prefer what is, after all, a Romantic work to be played with a touch of Romanticism, I would recommend Munch on RCA (available currently as an import)."
5,Excellent material!,This book is very helpful for using either the MSComm control or the Win API for serial communications in VB. Anyone who has to communicate with a serial device using VB should have this book in their reference library. I used the information to help me write some serial drivers for a Human Machine Interface (HMI) application...
1,Waste of money!,I purchased this book hoping to integrate a serial device with Microsoft Access. It was a complete and utter waste of money. I wrote to author expressing my frustration. I now receive spam from his email address.
5,Great Book! Helped me a lot...,"Needed to write a VB6.0 program to communicate with ten (10) temperature controllers via RS485. Also wrote an ActiveX dll in VB6.0 to communicate to an Electrocraft Servo Drive Controller. This book helped immensely in both of those tasks. If you need examples of how to use the MSCOMM control, this book is it!"
4,Brings serial support and VB together nicely,"I am always pleasantly surprised by the number of people in thetechnical world who take the time to summarize their knowledge andshare it with others. Dick Grier has done a fine job of getting together information that ties serial communications and Visual Basic together. If you are a novice to intermediate user of either serial communications or Visual Basic (in my case, I am a novice VB programmer), the book will provide sufficient info to get you ""over the top"". Modems, terminal emulators, loggers, GPS interfacing and telephony are some of the areas that are covered. You may find a sample app that fits just what you are trying to accomplish. To facilitate moving beyond the information the book provides, Dick has included a list that covers lots of additional resources for data."
3,Looking for a Serial Comm Tutorial Type,"One thing that i like in this book is the author's recommendation on how to optimize the serial communication program in terms of program execution speed. However, i do not like the way source codes are pointed out. Some codes are shaded gray and it took me time to find which code is being explained. Each line of code should have been numbered. Additionally, the book may need to add some more pages that will walk the reader through a small most common serial comm project from ""scratch to finish"". Overall, this book is a good reference."
2,absoluteley terrible,"The back cover offers more than the contents. It's just this guy's intricite musings. Very lengthy and detailed meanderings. Naming scores of people, locations, measurements, and times to the nearest detail, without any real subject. Mixed with isolated anecdotes. This book is best for someone with a deteriorating mental condition who is best to be kept in confusion and stupor. I gave it an extra star because it has an intriguing purple and pink color."
2,Whatever,"This book did nothing for me, just bored me. This guy gives so called evidence, ""yea right"", not enough to get someone's attention. For someone who worked for the cia and wrote a book about extraterrestrial he better have more than what this book had to offer.Over all just a dull, stale book."
4,Very pleased,"I purchased this from Lowe's because I wanted a rotisserie and I needed a new toaster oven. I love it. It works wonderful as a rotisserie, 6lb chicken in an hour and half. The toasting is perfect, but I am still learning the convection and baking side of it. I don't think it is too noisy for what it is and does. I have had no problems with it in the two months that I have it, but I kept the box, just in case. I think this is an awesome alternative to heating up our oven for smaller baking/cooking dishes."
1,euro-pro/bravetti jo287 convection oven,"this arrived dead - heat wouldn't go above 250 degrees F - convection fan only stayed on 30 seconds. called vendor who said ""call europro"" -after being on hold for 25 minutes on their 800 number, finally got customer support - no rma# issued - can return at my expense to Plattsburgh NY and in 60-90 days will either get repaired or replaced unit - won't be buying europro or bravetti products again and probably won't waste money on return (insured postage was $30)"
2,disappointing,"I was very diappointed to find out that even though it shows the oven with 2 pies,infact you can only bake one at a time.The book that comes with it is very lacking in information.It also tells you to set the oven on 450 for almost everything and then at the bottom it has a chart that tells you to set it on 325 to 375 depending on what you are cooking???If I had it to do over, I would buy another before this one............It is alright but maybe too many things included in one appliance is not a good thing and we should give up the space on the counter........"
5,Very Efficient & Effective use for small families,"I purchased this item from Target almost 2 years ago and I have had no problems with it. Several times every week we use the different functions and it saves me having to use my big oven. I even bake my whole chickens in it. Good for French Fries or crispy texture items. I use this appliance instead of microwave for heating up specific foods as it heats the food better without losing texture. I would not do without it. I am currently creating a new kitchen and I am trying to configure how to include this without being on the counter. That's how important it is!Euro-Pro JO287 Jet Rotisserie and Convection Oven, Stainless Steel"
2,We have reached an understanding,"This is a tricky little oven. I was exasperated with it until I ignored the labels on the knobs and, with the aid of an oven thermometer, experimented with all the settings to see which ones gave the desired temperatures for hotter baking. I wouldn't recommend buying it but I'm glad I finally managed to make mine useful."
1,Bravetti Oven - Terrible product - avoid,The temperature knob didn't work right out of the box. Oven doesn't get hotter than 250 as other people also state. Useless piece of crap. Avoid this brand at all costs.
5,Making Magic with Gaia,"Spiritual ecology is a practice whose time is now. Francesca Howell has written a clear and informative manual about how to achieve well-being for ourselves and our natural world, Gaia. She draws on many spiritual traditions - Wiccan, Buddist, Taosit, Pagan and native cultures to offer information about balance, healing, guides, shamanism and crystals. Each chapter contains visual exercises to bring you closer to your spiritual self and concludes with very practical ecological suggestions for positive change in the world. It only takes one person to make a positive change. This delightful book is an excellent guide. It is highly recommended."
4,Ex-roadie biased review,"I was the drummers roadie when they were working on this album in L.A. during the late 80's, so I had the chance to hear these songs being created. This album has the live sound and passion that was present during rehearsal. Not all the songs are serious, and some are just plain silly, but the songwriting and the lyrics are a notch above most."
5,Ultra-Clean Air Purifier,"This is the second unit that I have purchased. I am now in the market to purchase at least two or three more. They are wonderful. You can see the dust, hair, etc being pulled out of the air. I have five cats and between the hair and litter it really helps. These are great little machines. I would recommend highly.Thank you.Carol L. Camacho"
3,Does most of what I expected,The air purifier does appear to be well built and does not produce an unacceptable noise level. The larger dust or lint paricles that seem to hang in the air have been reduced but not eliminated in the month since we began use. I suspect that the microscopic allergens have been addressed to a possitive effect as the symptons have almost totally been releived. Our suspected culprits were dust mite issues and cat dander.The only complaint so far is that the instruction manual provided was not for the same model received.
1,A horribly deceptive book that is NOT for children,"I grabbed this book for my girls (5 and 6 years old). I agree with one of the reviewers below that this book is essentially pornographic in nature. My mouth dropped as I read the two sides to this story - one on ""luck"" and one on ""love"". It's ridiculous and should be pulled from the ""Children's book"" category."
4,What other reviewers don't understand.,"Other reviewers of this product don't seem to understand what it actually is, and what it is not. It is NOT a Japanese disk with the original Japanese music from SailorMoon. It IS, however, a German disk with GERMAN Sailor Moon music. This is music that showed up in the german dub of the show, and other selections that the publisher felt went along with the theme. [Kind of like tracks on a disk that are listed as ""inspired by [title of show here]"".] I personally enjoy the German music for Sailormoon. You couldn't get much further from the original Japanese themes if you tried, but it's still quite enjoyable in its own right.So, in short, do not purchase this if you're looking for the original Japanese music. DO purchase this if you enjoy the german dub of Sailor Moon, or are collecting Sailor Moon items from around the world [this is a great piece to fill out such a collection]."
1,This is Sailor Moon music?,"I don't really understand this series of import CDs. They boast Sailor Moon on the cover, but inside is a strange collection of American and German songs ranging from pop to rap. Most of it sounds too childish or too Teen bop MTV style... And why the heck is Aaron Carter on here? Last time I checked, the REAL Sailor Moon didn't have anything like that.My big mistake was getting this CD because it had Sailor Moon on the cover. Now I hide it so it won't detract from the glory of my Japanese Sailor Moon CDs. (Ya know, the REAL songs for the ORIGINAL version of the show) If you want Sailor Moon music, then get the Sailor Stars Best Collection or the Memorial Song box. All the songs are in Japanese, but the quality and originality is unbeatable. This CD is not anime music. Just strange..."
5,to carry on,HERE IM STANDING I THE NIGHT MY CERESENT WOND THE ONLY LIGHT I'VE COME ACROSS MY DARKEST FEARS BUT I SENSE MY FRIEND ARE NEAR I GET FROM EACH THE POWER I NEED SO WE CAN DEFEAT . GIVE US THE STRENTH TO CARRY
1,ARE YOU ALL INSANE,"My parents bought me this cd, and i was so excited, but when i put it in I was sorely disappointed. All the songs are ridiculous and stupid. What is up with that dumb Tamagatchi song. How can you like a song with some freak singing about her digital pet. The songs were designed for people with mush for brains. I only liked 1 song(it wasn't very good), but considering there are 19 tracks, that's 5%. I would not recommend this to anyone even if i hated them. If i could give this a negative 10 I would give it -100. I will never buy an import cd from anywhere but japan again. I can barely stand listning to it."
5,Lunarock,"Even though I don't really love the DiC version of Sailor Moon this cd is GREAT! I love the songs! Most are very upbeat and fun to dance to! I got this cd and I love it! The songs are: ""The Power Of Love"", ""I Want Someone To Love"", ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"", ""Who Do You Think You Are"", ""Moonlight Densetsu"", ""Daddy's Girl"", ""Ai No Senshi"", ""Nothing At All"". I'm very pleased with this cd, and I would definatly reffer this cd to you! ^.^"
4,Track Listing:,"Track Listing:1. First Movement from Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 672. Minuet in G3. Fur Elise4. First Movement from Sonata No. 14 in C Sharp Minor, Op. 27, No. 2 ""Moonlight""5. ""Turkish March"" from Ruins of Athens6. Final Movement from Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Op. 125 ""Choral"""
3,Ehh....where have the rebels gone...,"I like some songs on this cd...i like more rock n roll punk rock as opposed to how the rebels used to be (even though it's basically a completely new band). the old rebels was just generic punk, but it was good. this cd is edging on emo almost, you can always write a love song or two. but the whole cd is just blasted by them...my favorite RCR album is No Good, No Time, No Pride...it's full of fisting pumping anthems and rock n roll guitars...as well as a girly song...i'd recommend that over this one."
1,Hate to be loved? It shows.,"This album is aweful. I saw these guys on the warped tour and what a bunch of douchbags they turned out to be. When I went up to talk to one of them, they totally blew me off. And while on stage the acted like they where to good to play. They acted like rockstar. After the show I still went out and bought the cd. I reget that now. They no longer write songs about the joy of playing music or social misfortune. And the make-up and the cloths, come on! I know you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but these guys had nothing to do with this two albums ago. Now they're dressing up like the rolling stones and acting like them too. If you want a good, no, no, a great RCR cd pick, 'Playing to live and livin' to play,' you will not be disappoint. It's filled with soul, passion, and fist raising anthems, 'Hated to be loved,' is an piece of sh*t which RCR should disown."
1,Oh please.,"If I could give this negative stars, I would.The river city rebels have changed.If you want to hear good RCR, listen to ""Racism, Religion, and War"", ""Playing to live, living to play"", or ""No good, No time, No pride."" This CD is ultimate crap. I've been a fan of RCR for a while now. They actually used to live in my area. They used to play local gigs all the time, but Bopper's head swelled so huge that they left and moved to Washington without even a goodbye show.In an old RCR song, they stated ""it ain't the fashion but the passion that makes you strong.""In new RCR, they say ""got the passion for the fashion.""So there you have it. Don't waste your money on this CD. I'm wondering what the heck to do with mine. Just smash it.. or use it as a paint tray. you know.The music has changed.. so have the people. I used to be pretty good friends with CJ and Botox.. but CJ left [bless him] and Botox is a walking STD now.just. don't. buy. it."
1,river city jerks who l eave fans at a gig,I am going to tell you all why not to buy any cds of this band see them in concert or buy a shirt. February 10th at rock angel cafe in Paducah Kentucky the band river city rebels were suppose to play. I got there and they had already left the gig. I asked someone where is that band. they said they told him were are going to split. After they left alot of people showed up. I emailed the band and asked them why they canceled on us and they wrote a really mean email about how they don't like paducah or jesus christ. A christain band was there called sidewalk slam on tooth and nail records. I don't know if they were offended to play with a christain band or not. Don't waste your money on this band.They aren't worth it.
1,Lame,"I saw these guys at a show last night. I didn't go to see them but they just so happened to be playing. They were extremely LAME. They just stood up on the stage and moaned at the crowd. A couple members just leaned against the wall while they were not playing. These guys think they are soo big, but they are nothing."
2,Dont mind the stars,"Dont mind the stars, I gave this game low stars because I just received my copy of HALO 3: Limited Edition, and it came really scratched. As a video game collector I was very disappointed, other than that, the game is absolute 9.5/10 and I really recommend getting it if you own a xbox360"
2,Halo3,Recieved in timely matter.Discs were loose and bouncing around in box which scuffed them up.They appear to work ok tho.They should have been packaged with some foam or at least in a paper sleeve to prevent rattling around in the box.
4,Halo 3,"(Only played campain single player)in this respect good game, not great. Not enough diversity in wheapons. Can't up grade armor. I know this game was built for online play and to create very skilled game play for compatitions but just would be nice to have an outstanding campain game that had so much hipe."
3,"Not as good as Halo2, but still a fun game for 2 or more players.","I was disappointed with the story and play of this game but its still fun. I personally think Halo 2 was the best, they kind of gave up trying to impress us on this one. I ordered it from amazon and it came scratched which I heard happened to many buyers. The game still works though."
3,Ok,"Could have been longer, needs more multiplayer maps. Online is just plain. Could use upgrades to make it better."
1,Damaged companies deliver damaged games....,Badly scratched limited edition does not even play....brought it back to Wal-Mart...every limited edition that they have is badly scratched.....heard that Microsoft know about this and they did nothing...just delivered a damaged game to the trusting public. When are we going to hold Mocrosoft accountable.
4,One last adventure in 5 hours or less.,"Halo 3 Limited Edition is a great final hoo-rah with the chief. Annihalating Brutes any way you can invent, beautiful air battles, jumping into battle with Elites right behind you, and massive, massive amounts of flood. Unfortunately, this adventure only lasts about 5-6 hours of gameplay so keep that in mind. I wasn't happy with the limited edition. Buying it online, I didn't realize it would be so big and bulky. Don't get me wrong, the contents are great with a book, extra disc, and awesome design, but I wish it didn't take up 3 game spaces on my shelf."
5,Great,"Great, I even got it for less then the original Halo 3. Why does everyone hate it? It's worth it, and it was cheaper for me too. Good deal."
2,over 6 months later and the problem remains!,"So I just bought the Limited Edition in the tin box and guess what? BOTH discs were heavily scratched!! The game plays but when I load my Xbox with the game inside, it sticks at the welcome screen! I dunno if the replacement program still works but it is unfair that we have to pay to post them to Microsoft and be without the game for weeks!The game itself follows from where Halo2 left off and while it offers nothing ""special"" or unique from the previous games in the trilogy, it is still fun to play. Now if only the game would actually come in a playable condition!"
4,Good game,"I am a fan of the halo series, and in all honesty the game is pretty good. Of course it was over hype, but still. In campaign mode, the graphics or pretty stunning, storyline isn't really that great and it does feel like your playing halo 2 with better graphics. All in all I would give the campaign a 7 out of 10. Multiplayer is great( of course), nothing bad to say about it. I would give Multiplayer 10 out of 10. All in all, its a good game and definitly worth getting. Buy this game, but be careful about this Limited Edition. I have been hearing about the disc being scatchs up and getting this edition and seeing it myself confirms it for me."
2,Great game: horrible package,"Do not, under any circumstances, buy the Special Edition. The first package I received had both discs scratched so badly they were unreadable. Amazon customer service was great: they sent a replacement overnight: I had it 2 days later.The game itself is great: a fine finish to the series. This episode had the best plot line of any: the last 30 minutes were worth of Joss Wheadon. Too bad the game was spoiled by the horrible packaging."
3,"Lots to do, but to short for the $$","I enjoyed the game and right when you are really getting a feel for the game its all over. I have finished the normal difficulty in less then 5 hours and the Heroic in less then 8 hours. For the money this is just too short of a campaign for such a fine franchise. The online is really fun and the new rankings for battling online is awesome. Another nice feature is the saving video and using the forge map editor is a lot of fun. Overall I would suggest this game if you have xbox live. If you do not then you payed for a half a game that is way to short,(9 levels worth).Yes the rumors are true for this edition because my game disk was scratched as well as everyone else's. : ("
3,The Shortest Straw,"I have always enjoyed the franchise, but i play for the story. I beat the game in 6 hours.I feel cheated.For $65 i expect to play for 15 hours at the least. I'm really dissapointed. The limited edition disc were scratched just like the rumors, but the discs worked fine. I agree that these games are WAYover-hyped. The story does wrap it up and i was having a good time till it ended. Just think long and hard before you throw your money away."
1,Limited Edition = Scratched Game!!,"While Halo 3 is a must game for the Xbox 360, the limited edition version of it is not. Due to a packaging error, the game disc comes out all scratched to hell. Buy a different version of this game! You have been warned!"
1,The metalic box scrath the Disk,"This special edition its a shame for Halo 3. If you order this item, you probably will return it, cause the game will arrive with a lot of scratches.. I recomend the game but the regular set. PS. I wrote this review after recive two special edition of Halo 3, and YES the result was the same. I just send it back. Save your time, In fact Xbox its calling back the special edition. BUT THE GAME IS GREAT!!!!!!!"
3,"Too short, and scratched","The Limited Editions are the ones that have scratched disks, largely due to the bad design of the little middle holder doodad (whatever it's called). The disks basically didn't snap on, and rubbed against it and became scratched. Mine arrived scratched, but the game played without a problem.The bigger problem is that the game is way too short. I'm not a fast gamer, and most games people refer to as ""rentals"" are way too long for me to finish during the rental timeframe. This game was only about 8 hrs long (compared to about 20 for most ""rentals""). If I had known that I would have rented it, and I'm regretting spending the amount of money I did for what should have been part of Halo 2.If you play multi-player, you may get your money's worth, as there are a lot of people playing which should make for a good experience. However, there are probably other games that will be just as fun, and that don't cost this much that you could get instead."
1,BeWare Avoid the Limited Eddition Scratched Discs!!!,Please avoid the Tin Box Halo3 Limited Edition the discs are scratched badly I haven't tried the game yet. but from the looks of it it won't work. I just wrote my review to save much ppl as possible.
3,Watch out for loose DVDs,"This is the second Halo I buy, for the first ""went missing"" from home... Before I bought this one, I read a review warning that the DVD was loose inside the case, and was totally scratched and ruined. I thought that was just a case of bad luck...Got it anyway. To my dismay, my DVD was also loose, and scratched. It does work, however. But sometimes it will not start... than you have to open it, polish the disk a little, and try again, and again, and again... it's very disappointing."
5,excelent game but the quality of the box...........,"halo is a great game but the box is not a good product, is a limited edition but the disc come with a little scrach and the service that microsoft ofered to change de game is not good, so complicaded to aperson whhad to wait 3 weeks o more for the game"
5,great fun and well worth the so called hype,"i highly recommend getting this game, the graphics are pretty cool, the flood are crazy and the weapons are fun. get this game and get some achievement points and have fun while doing it. multiplayer is tons of fun too! i got both the halo controllers to go with the system and game, i really got into this game and you will too!"
1,Beware this edition of Halo 3,"Definitely not good to buy this edition of Halo 3. Ours was scratched. I was told to call Microsoft. Turnaround time they said was a week, but when I called back on another question for them, they told me that it would take about 10 business days. Basically two weeks. I called Amazon and just processed it for a return. I went to my local Walmart and we opened every one of these editions. They were all scratched. Not one was intact. We opted for the Halo 3 Standard which is good enough.Shame on Microsoft for sending out such a poorly designed case with their ""Limited Edition""."
1,Limited Edition case is defective,"Game is great, but beware. The Limited Edition of this game comes in a defective case. Everyone I've talked to that has purchased this version, including myself, have gotten their copies with the game off the spindle, extremely scratched and unusable. We now have to send in our discs to MS and wait for replacements.I highly recommend getting one of the other two version of this game."
2,Add me to the list ...,".. of people who pre-ordered Halo 3 Limited Edition and received it a week and a half late only to discover that the discs had fallen off the mount and got severely scratched up in transit.I got the game last night and sent the discs in for replacement today. I didn't bother to even try to use the discs, the scratches were deep enough to look almost like the disc got dropped on rocky pavement and run over by a truck."
1,"Limited Edition is Scratched, rumor is conformed","If you're just thinking of buying Halo 3, please dont consider the Limited Edition. Most of the ones that are bought by me and friends are scratched. Due to the bad design of the box it destroys the CDs inside. If you have the time to purchase and send back to get a replacment, be my guest. Buy either get the Normal, or the Legendary (The one I got after) is great. I like the packing, and the CD case inside is the same as the normal one.Halo 3 is the best game there is. Have fun and see you in the battle field."
2,Disappointing...really disappointing!,Pros:Weapons are niceCons:Graphics should be betterSingle player is too short and the storyline is incoherentMultiplayer has vertical bars when playing split-screen on widescreen HDTVMindless run and gunConclusion:Don't buy into the marketing hype. Halo is up there with IPOD's in my humble opinion. If you want to play a good FPS get the Orange Box or Bioshock - both make Halo look ridiculously bad in comparison.
1,Do NOT Order This Iten,"This edition of this item has an intrinsic manufacturing defect. The disc will come loose from the storage hub, and then it will rattle around inside a large space getting scratched during shipment all of the way to you. Amazon will take the item back, but why deal with the aggravation. This is a known problem, and Amazon keeps shipping these out to customers anyway. If you must have this item, look for it locally and try to find one that is not loose inside the packaging."
2,"Worth it, or not worth it. That is the question",This is for good ol billy. You make entirely too much money to be hiring cheap labors to create a crappy case for Halo 3 Limited Edition. You should change your company name from microsoft to non-micomanaged. However the game play is ok since I had to borrow someone else's disk.
4,waht else is there to say.....,Excellent game expanding on an excellent idea....Primarily I play this game on X-Box Live multiplayer....EXCELLENT!!!
3,Damaged During Shipping,"Two discs... not secured well in holder... thus one disc damaged in shipping... disappointed, but not worth hassle to get replaced."
3,cds scratched,"The game was a gift, I have heard the cds are scratched up. So far the game is playing ok."
3,Just Another Game,"This was way overhyped. Yes it was fun and that's why I gave it four stars as a fun factor. However, I thought Halo 1 and 2 were also fun.This game is way to short (8 Hours on Legendary), the story is kind of boring, and it just didn't seem like it was the end of the trilogy. I expected a lot more and I was disapointed.As a Halo fan, this game is a must to play. But if you are a fan of just playing video games and you don't care that much about the Halo franchise, I would go with Gears of War, Bioshock, or just wait for Mass Effect."
2,expected more,this sure smacked me with disappointment. graphically its lingering in about 2005 or late 06(which makes sense cause it was delayed) and gameplay was the same as the first two. microsoft we love halo but i sure expected more salt in the soup this time.
1,Triple Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bought three Limited Editions from Wal-Mart...Had to return to exchangefor basic editions.I have enjoyed Halo, Halo 2, and Halo 3 beta.I will continue to play online with Halo 3, and cooperative campaign online.As much as I like Halo 3, I wonder why close combat situations are not asgood as Halo 2. I do not get the same emotional visceral effect when Imelee an opponent then tea-bag them. Everything in Halo 3 is better than Halo 2 except close combat situations.I am still unable to get out of the first level of campaign, because the play stops...have tried several adjustments...no good.On line cooperative play has so much lag it is unplayable."
1,ANGRY TROOPER,"IM A 82ND AIRBORNE PARATROOPER SERVING OVER SEA'S AND THE ONE THING WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ON ARE FREE TIME IS WATCHING A DVD OR PLAYING A VIDEO GAME, I PRE ORDERED THIS GAME LONG BEFORE IT CAME OUT, NOT ONLY DID IT TAKE MUCH LONGER TO GET TO ME*I UNDERSTAND IM IN THE DESERT BUT HOW DID EVERYONE ELSE OVER HERE GET THIERS SO EARLY?* BUT WHEN IT DID GET HERE I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE DISC*THE BONUS DISK* WAS SCRATCHED REALLY BAD AND THAT THE OTHER ONE WAS A BONUS DISK ASWELL, THE EXACT SAME DISK AS THE FIRST ONE, I THOUGHT MABE THEY JUST LOOK ALIKE SO I PUT BOTH IN AND SAW THAT THEY WERE THE EXACT SAME DISK NO GAME IN THE BOX JUST 1 SCRATCHED BONUS DISK AND ANOTHER BONUS DISK, WTF?!!!"
1,Scratched Discs. Someone should be flogged,"The others reviews about scratched disks are right on the money. I had no idea, and hadn't read any reviews before I bought. Do NOT buy the Limited Edition version, unless they repackage it. Shameful that they put out such a poor product design for such a huge release. What a fiasco. Both my discs were rolling around inside and all scratched up. I hope Best Buy doesn't give me a problem with the return. I'm sure the game itself is 5 star. This edition of it is 1 star."
1,I think buyers should have been made aware,"I bought this for my son, the first one was so scratch. Of course Amazon was amazing and I returned it and he had the new one before they even received the old one. However, the second was scratched worse, and my son asked me just to take him to have it buffed. Come to find out, there were thousands of games with this problem and now we have to deal with microsoft themselves. A head up would have been nice."
3,Very fine quality... of the disk,"While the game is in exceptional condition, I would prefer to have a case to go along with it to contribute in looks to my collection of Xbox games. If I come to be told that the whole no-case concept was in the description, I will be more than happy to eat crow, but the fact that the disk case is in the picture is misleading, along with the general assumption that when you order a disk, it will come in its original transportation holder."
3,Decent,"Be prepared for some stuttering on the dvd as it seems that the frame rate is off. However this is a decent dvd for beginners who are new to the game.However for their sake I wish he would of gone into hand, hip and foot position before recieving the ball and how to fight for it down low especially if a defender is denying you or has a good X step. On that note defense is completley ignored. Search around there are better dvds out there.Also be prepared...what he calls ""drills"" are really just post moves. The only true drill is at the start, the Miken drill which he just calls ""a nice warm up drill"".There are some positives though. He has some great explanations of the moves at the high post and at the 13 foot.This is the first review Ive written for Amazon but this is more just a devils advocate piece against the glowing reviews Ive seen on here."
1,Avoid this product,Product does not do what it says it would do. Very dissapointed. Have to take up to four pills for bowel movement.
4,good seed tray,I've purchased this seed tray locally but cannot find it now. It is very good for white millet and other food for ground-feeding wild birds and keeps the seed relatively dry and clean.
2,Bird feeder,This was nothing like I expected.Next time I will take out a tape measure so that I know how big or small this was
2,FEEDER TRAY,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - IT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED - I PAID MORE FOR SHIPPING THAN I DID FOR THE FEEDER TRAY!
3,"Too much ""artistic"" contrivance...","It is a great story and very much a tragic reality for the exploited people of the Andes, unfortunately the flow and authenticity of the film was ruined by the overdone and superficial interludes of surrealism that took the earthiness of the story from the heart back up into the head. It is still worth watching if you skip these overly art directed bits."
5,Kindle version please!,I would like a Kindle version please.Please vote for Kindle everybody. I already have these in paper.
5,What a delight!,"I love the Seth books and purchased this fiction piece by Jane based on the reviews. Everyone was right. It's extremely entertaining, easy reading, and a pleasure to read a story based on such a very big perspective. The action is tons of fun and there were a number of moments in these novels when I was deeply moved by the ideas and emotions of the characters. If you like metaphysical stuff and science fiction, buy this one and enjoy."
4,MS SQL Server must be 2005,This is a great product but some of the advanced features weren't available in SQL Server 2000. I really liked the windowing and hierarchical queries in this book but those features are not available in 2000. For the most part 2000 isn't used that often anymore but if you are one of the unfortunate to have to use it there will be some compatibility problems with the examples in this book.
2,Quite inconsistent and confusing book,"Maybe not a bad source for an exepienced SQL programmer, but very frustrating for a beginner. There's no such thing as ""generic SQL""; regretfully, it's vendor-specific and doesn't really comply ANSI stndards..."
2,Not as advanced as claimed.,"This book claims to be an intermediate/advanced but all the consents it covers are what I would call basic. If you already have a good handle on Select, Insert, Update, and Delete statements this book will not be much help."
5,Excellent SQL book,"I really like this book. It is an excellent book for anyone who wants to learn SQL and takes advantage of the power of SQL. If you are developing software or application to support multiple database platform, this is a must have reference. If you are familiar one databse platform, such as Oracle, and now you are working on different database platform, such as MySql, it will help you to grasp it in no time."
4,Great Reference!,"The SQL Cookbook is an excellent reference. It is a handy aid for those instances when you need a quick ""How To"" idea. Mostly I use it as a reference. However, it was useful to skim through the book and pickup different and more efficient ways to write existing queries."
4,Good SQL reference,This books does what it's supposed to do. Lots of good solutions to SQL problems.
5,SQL Cookbook by Anthony Molinaro,"The book: SQL Cookbook by Anthony Molinaro, is an outstanding book. It is a book long overdue. Anthony provides solutions to everyday, real world problems with straight SQL for 5 databases: Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, PostgresSQL, and MySQL. I have also run some of his solutions in Sybase and Microsoft Access databases and those solutions worked, also. Next, I decided to run some of his code in Crystal Reports and Impromptu and that worked, also.I recommend this book for all Developers, DBAs, Database Architects, SQL Programmers, SQL Experts, Report Writers, Power Users, and anyone who wishes to enhance and increase their knowledge in writing SQL. This is a ""must have"" book."
3,a lot of trivial problems,"The books has some worthwhile information in the last third of the book, but most of it is very basic material:- how to get the smallest and largest values from a columns (use the min and max and group by functions - this is good for novices, of no use to me)- how to insert a record ?- counting rows in a table :-)- it doesnt contain Sybase examples - though the syntax will work in most casesIn fairness there are some good parts as well, all I'm saying is this is not a great book if you are already experienced.Its good for beginners."
5,International School of Sugarcraft: Book 2 : Advanced,More great pictures and easily understood instructions.
4,Its just wire...,"Nothing wrong with this wire, just want to state that it is a single strand - not 2 conductor like I was hoping for. Not sure if I missed this in the description or if it was just absent."
3,neck pillow,"I was hoping this was the miracle pillow for my neck pain. It's not, but probably not the pillow's fault. I do like the way it supports the upper spine morethan any other neck pillow I've ever used. I do like the way it feels when I sleep on my side.It will probably work well for most people."
5,Therapeutica Sleeping Pillow,"Wife has not woken up with a headache since using this pillow. Do to neck pain her headache where severe. Yes it is pricey, but worth the cost. Would recommend a try if you suffer from morning headaches. And with Amazon delivery was very fast."
1,Shameful,"Watch out for the warranty on this pillow. It is not built to last. After 4 years of use it has fallen apart and the company will not replace it without charging me $48.95 and shipping costs. I sent them pictures and a reciept as they asked of me (frankly, I don't think the customer service manager at Therapeutica, Wendy, thought I would be able to produce them. Initially they didn't even return my first two calls. They seem to be pretty wiley. I wouldn't buy this pillow unless you plan on replacing it frequently to the tune of $70-$100. Lousy odds."
2,There's no such thing as average....,"Yea, sure, anyone over 40 would like the perfect pillow, but let's face it; we are all structurally different, and this pillow comes in three sizes. So unless you are lucky enough to defy the laws of probability and happen to have a stature and physical structure that suits to a ""T"" the dimensions of this thing, it just won't work. Instead, design your own made to order pillow based on the precise measurements and features of your own body. There are lots of good books on the subject, but since you can't get rich designing a pillow designed expressly for your unique self, you probably won't get very far in marketing it, unless you show the reader how to figure out how to tailor-make one for him/herself. Let's put it another way. If a clothing store advertised 'the perfect suit' that was not tailor-made, but rather came in a few different sizes, how 'perfect' would the fit be. I rest my head."
1,Save your money,I've had this pillow for almost 2 months now and I must say that it's AWFUL. I'm more tired now that ever because it's hard to sleep on me side as I normally do. The platform for your head is too small therefore you fight with it throughout the night to keep from rolling into the cradle. This pillow is a pain in the neck. I have more neck and shoulder pains now from trying to sleep on this beast. Buying this pillow was a waste of good money!
1,Worst pillow ever. Even worse customer service...,"This is the worst pillow I have ever seen. I tried to lay on it when I first received it and it hurt my neck so badly that I immediately wrote to Medex Supply to try to return it or exchange it for something else. Having spend nearly $70, I was expecting something that would help with my neck pain, not make it worse.They have refused to take the item back or offer any kind of resolution for me, such as an exchange, etc. I am so disappointed. Usually, Amazon is good about issues like this and they have not offered a resolution either. So, I'm out the $70 and own a pillow I cannot use.I DO NOT recommend this pillow NOR Medex Supply."
4,Good for keeping neck in one position!,"After having a ruptured disk in my neck from sleeping funny on my old pillow, I switched to this one. Since using this pillow I have not had any neck or back pain or kinks. This pillow is good if you are a back sleeper because the pillow craddles your head so that your head doesn't flop to one side or the other. The reason I only gave it a 4* versus a 5* is that I have a little trouble getting comfortable when I first lay down at night. I actually took a knife and scissors and had to cut some material from the neck area to soften and shorted the slope that was originally there, but again I have had no back or neck issues when I awaken so it is worth the initial getting comfy issue over pain and kinks!!"
4,Less neck pain,"The pillow takes some getting use to. But after a month, my neck pain has decreased, its still tight though. Probably need a neck message to get it back."
4,It works,"My husband snores like there's no tomorrow and he does not want to use his CPAP. I really need my sleep so I decided to try the pillow. He thinks is helping, I think is helping a little but the main reason I don't think is the pillow but my water bed. I think if I use the pillow on a regular bed it actually would stop him from snoring. Good buy."
1,Shameful,I want everyone who is considering buying this pillow to be fully aware that it will not last very long and the warranty is not for replacement. Not unless you want to buy one at a prorated discount that ends up being nearly the cost of a new one when all is said and done. I suspect this is a scam. Do your homework on this one and read ALL the low star reviews with ALL the vendors and you won't make the same mistake I did.
2,"Okay, no miracle for me.","Fine if I stay on my back, but I dont care for the side sleeping, it's awkward for me. I can't comment on the snoring issue. If you sleep on your back, you might like this. I could not get used to the side part.Dont spend extra money for faster shipping, the regular got there just as fast, and was cheaper. I bought two pillows, so I know. Make sure you measure before you buy."
3,Good for the single sleeper,"This pillow was recommended by my chiropractor. It really does work well - definitely keeps your shoulders from scrunching underneath. It's concept makes sense that you could roll to back and either side easily and still have support without having to readjust your pillow. But I share a queen-sized bed and when I roll to my side, I turn in place. If I were to roll the way the pillow was designed for me to roll, I'd need such a wide margin of the bed. The pillow is 25.5"" wide so if you're on your side, where could your arms go comfortably and not invade the other side of the bed? I needed the pillow so bad that I dealt with having to move the pillow to my head's position instead. But I found that I would lay my head in the wrong spot in the middle of the night b/c of the space problem, thus negating the purpose of the pillow. Once my pain was better, I moved onto a Tempurpedic pillow. Now I have this pillow I don't know what to do with."
1,This pillow made my pain much worse.,"I tried to use the therapeutic pillow to ease my constant neck pain. Instead, the pillow made my neck hurt in places where it never hurt before. I could not move my head. I am so sorry I ordered this pillow and lost all of my money because, as I found out afterwards, I cannot return it. This non-return policy was not displayed anywhere in the ordering process. As for customer courtesy, the company won't even acknowledge my e-mails."
4,great pillow!!!,"My chiroprator recommended this pillow, it took about a week to get use to it. But now I can feel the difference. It's a great pillow."
2,did not sleep well,"I did not sleep well when using this pillow. I could not get comfortable using this pillow, and stopped using it."
4,Great for CPAP,"I struggled for a long time with my CPAP unit. The mask would ""fall off"" during the night as I found it uncomfortable. I have no other choice to use CPAP but I was averaging about 2-3 hours a night. I figured out that my head position was off and all the pillows behind my head was not helping me breath easier. I bought the Therapeutica pillow in hopes it will help me and it has. As I start my sleep on my back, the pillow positions my head so it opens up my air passageways, allowing me to breath with my mask on. Once asleep, I tend to move to a side position which is fine using this pillow. I am now using CPAP for a full night and waking up well rested. If you are a CPAP user and especially those who are struggling with using it, I would consider buying this pillow."
5,After suffering for years-- FINALLY!,"I noticed when I went to the dentist that lending my head back reduced my TMJ ""clicking."" I decided to sleep without a pillow that night to see if that would help-- it did help but it was very uncomfortable. The next night I tried rolling up a towel. Also uncomfortable. I looked for a pillow on Amazon to see if anyone created a pillow to help your head lean ""back"" more than a regular pillow and found this pillow. I noticed a noticeable change in my TMJ ""clicking"" after one night. After a couple weeks, I am completely used to sleeping with the pillow and have noticed a reduction in my symptoms (not just the clicking but also the neck tension and shoulder tension). I would highly recommend!"
5,Helped me switch to back sleeping,I'm very satisfied with this pillow. I've been a lifelong side sleeper and wanted to switch to sleeping on my back and this has been effective and comfortable.
2,This pillow did not help at all,Did not help neck discomfort at all. It was no more comfortable than an ordinary pillow. I would not recommend.
1,Therapeutica Pillow,"Although the pillow was comfortable, it has an extremely unpleasant odor that did not go away with airing out. The company did not respond to my requests for a replacement pillow. Very dissatisfied!"
3,Odd but okay,"This is a very strangely shaped pillow. Without a folded towel under it, I have a stiff neck and back pain when I wake up. There is also a cervical support that sticks out from under the concave part of the pillow, I sometimes find that uncomfortable. I don't use the two ""wings"" of the pillow for side sleeping, they aren't comfortable for me. In summary, for me, this pillow is better than a regular pillow and comparable to the contoured Brookstone tempurpedic pillow."
1,Shameful,"Customer service on this product is shameful. It is made of foam that cannot withstand an active sleeper. I spent a great deal of money thinking the product was replacement warranted up to 5 years. The warranty is prorated per every year of use up to 5 years, then they do you a big favor by letting you buy a replacement for a fee that is nearly the cost of a new one. It took me several weeks to get them to follow up with me. Never even returned my call the first time-I had to call them back 2x. Buyer beware- TriCore is a much better product at a better price point."
4,"Great pillow, just take into consideration your mattress firmness.","Great pillow, really holds your head nicely. It is softer than it looks, if you have used a memory foam pillow you will be fine with this. The main difference is memory foam gives and this supports way more. Only issue I encountered is that I had a more firm mattress before, now it is softer and my spine is somewhat angled now since I sink into my bed. My recommendation is that if you have a softer mattress, get the size down if you think you will sink into (side sleeper), I am a side sleeper so I can't say much for the back sleeping.I know one other thing, since I have been using the pillow I can now stretch and turn my head both ways more easily, to me that is a huge improvement and I owe it to this pillow. I removed one star since they don't say much about the firmness of the mattress and its effects so I feel that needs to be considered since there is no returning these once you receive them. Happy sleeping."
3,"Good concept, I dislike the foam.","I got one that was sized appropriately for me, I am pretty large (187cm, 220lbs, broad shoulders, side sleeper.) I felt the pillow was actually quite accurately sized for me and for keeping the neck in proper alignment, I just didn't like the hard feeling of the foam. Instead I am going to try and find regular pillow that is thicker, because I am constantly folding over pillows and doubling them up. It sits in my closet now but if someone I know is having neck issues I will give it to them because it's a decent piece of therapy for its intended purpose, it just didn't work for me."
3,Only if you need this pillow for medical reasons,"I purchased this pillow after the measurements said I would need a Petite Adult. It said to choose a smaller size if you are close to the next size. I DISAGREE. I believe I needed the Petite Medium after trying it. Also, the pillow is very difficult to get used to. In fact, if you are a light sleeper, you may never get used to it. I do not like the neck support (the little ramp that sticks out) because it might not be the right size for my neck and just in general is really awkward. I would recommend getting this pillow only if you need it medically. I needed it because when I sleep, my shoulder causes my bones to get out of alignment and my doctor recommended this brand."
4,MR.SPATS CAT a COMB,"Over the years I continue to purchase Mr.Spats Cat a Comb, and over the years I continue to have one Major criticism of this otherwise ""unique""and ""most worthwhile product"". THE VELCRO!!! This company should definitely change their Velcro to ""INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH"" Velcro, since the Velcro they enclose with the product is good for nothing. Their Velcro eventually pulls away from the wall or wherever it is placed, causing a half-on the wall - half-off the wall Cat a Comb. I purchaed some industrial strength velcro, removed the pads that come with the wall comb, and now everybody is happy...especially my fur-babies. D-CAT-LOVER"
3,Cats were not interested,My two cats were not interested in the catnip. So turns out I didn't need to buy this Cat a Comb since they ignore it.
2,Cat not interested,"I had two cats previously who truly loved this product and would use it all the time, but my new cat doesn't seem to have much interest in it at all. He seems to prefer to rub his neck on anything BUT this product, can't quite figure that one out - LOL But I think most cats would use this product."
3,Pretty good razor but...,Razor has lived up to most expectations. I have a tough beard but was tired of bleeding. Easy to use and lotion feature is nice. The profile states the sideburn trimmer is a standard feature. Upon calling Shavestore the guy blew me off quickly and said they do not come with the trimmer. Also that he does not recondition or package it and I need to call the folks that do. I did get a better response from them. Very polite and actually sent me a trimmer no charge. Middle man Shavestore was not very nice about it.
2,"Great Shoe, but terrible odor defect","I as well have experienced the strange odor problem with the New Balance 1122. My husband has actually been through two pairs- when the first pair began to develop an odor we just assumed that he had walked through some cat or other animal urine. After many attempts at washing, freezing, and bleaching the shoes we threw them out and bought another pair.However, in the past few weeks this pair has also developed the same smell in the same place- on the outside of the shoe near the sole. We thought this very odd that the same smell should develop in the same place. After some brief internet research I have found that others have experienced this, and will now try contacting New Balance about the problem.My husband would agree that these shoes are extremely comfortable. However, the odor is very strong and very bad."
3,Barnyard Buddies,"This video has become a favorite of my two year old because of the fabulous animal footage. The baby animal scenes seem to really catch her eye. The big drawback is the awful lyrics on the songs, and the repetition of the really monotonous musis."
3,Not built to last! Is production quality no longer an issue?,"Good toy, bad qualitys. I do not hate Barney at all. My child love Barney too. Don't misunderstand my typing.Barney makes his way into several children's lives. Every kid wants a Barney. Very much like the Pokemons for every kid is addicted to. They are trading the cards and rip people off with unfair tradings.Barney toy here is not strong fabric and the child chews his tail off. Unbelievable! He still have baby teeth but the tail come off from poor design and bad qualities. I tell to them, ""no more swetshop working, because the price is go up and the quality is go down."" Barney is a good boy. But the toy is not good. Also, in just 2 months, I see the Barney has toes sucked on with vigor by the child.........disappear completely! Barney have no tail and no toes now, so i will buy new toy. But not Barney toy; I will buy the Pokemon for better craftmen ships, and I will buy pookemon with no tail! Hehehe ^^"
2,Sizes too big,"I wear a 7 3/8 hat, and when I ordered following the company's guidelines, Extra Large, I got a hat that was HUGE on me. I think a large would have been much better."
2,Deprecated and old,This is a satisfactory treatment of the theory of functional differential equations. Many of the chapters are not written with students in mind so I could only partially recommend this work to professors of mathematics.
1,Sound quality is awful. Overpriced,"I have tried two different headsets namely H251N and H251. Same problem as reported by the previous reviewer - people can hear me well, but not the other way around. I have also tried playing mp3 files - and the quality is horrible. The sound is muffled, unclear, volume is low and there is some background noise. It appears that this unit is defective - some other people report good experience. Alternatively, this could be the Windows 7 issue (I have a 64 bit version - maybe this is not compatible with the device). In any event this is not useable"
5,A vicious attack on academia and Russia's place in it,"I too am shocked and outraged that such a book was allowed to appear. Haven't we staffed all our Slavic Departments with ardent Russophiles, elbowing out everybody who babbled something about changing times? I thought we have wiped out once and for all the pernicious critics of things Russian, all those de Custines who, you know, were all homosexuals and probably worse. If I knew who the coward hiding under the pen name of Professor Chudo was, I would have denounced him to the FSK!The long-suffering Russia received a slap in the face in this book. Invaded so many times, betrayed by her friends, this kind and gentle nation never fought a war (unless invaded), never hurt anyone, and it has always treated old people with respect. Moreover, the book fails to mention that in the eighteenth century, Russia already had great writers and more. Elena Petukhova"
5,Strange and Enticing Bedfellows,"If you enjoy literature, frown upon people, and wonder aboutacademia, or even if you don't give a hoot about any of this, the bookis funny. How does one enroll in a course of misanthropology? This book is a wonderful introduction. I knew nothing about Russian literature before reading this book and know even less about it now. For an academic, Alicia Chudo's insights are frankly illuminating. I would recommend seeking out her book Children of Mineppus, although I do not believe it could be more sharply delightful than this one. From beginning to end, from belly laugh to snigger, this book creates a Russian literary funhouse of clarifying distortion. And,no reference collection should be without The Devil's Dictionary of Received Ideas. Russian literature, Alicia Chudo, and the devil -- strange and enticing bedfellows. Highly recommended to tickle your funny bone plus and definitely will not lull you to sleep."
3,Works. But not impressively,"Sound quality is good. Battery life is short(possiblely due to the large screen). This is an okay mp3 player. But the relatively short battery life and the fact that it is nearly impossible to operate with one hand, make it much less useful when on the go. I bought my wife a Zune (30gb) and now I want one."
5,A good book - perfect for my 2nd grader,"A good vocabulary cannot be achieved over a short time. Young kids need to learn and read extensively to build their word base. This book is a great help. It organizes essential grade 1-3 words in 7 groups, and teaches them with activities and tests. Its well-designed word questions help to clarify the right usage of related words that kids often misuse otherwise. My child used it for learning as well as for assessment. Very good contents. I guess due to lack of standard, this book is perfect for my 2nd grader. He finished it in 4 weeks. Word study should never stop. For similar learning, I found Beestar (www.beestar.org) very helpful, too. My child's vocabulary is improved quickly with such word drills."
2,missing page,The book is done a few pages and 2 pages are missing. It doesn't mention on the description. It is very bad :(
2,Not Easy to Begin,Photosuite looks like it will be a good program if I can ever learn how to use it. I think it would be easy if there were any instructions provided with the program. There is a booklet provided with the program that shows what you can do with the program but not how to do it. Very frustrating! I can see the tools on the screen but can't get them to work. I do not appreciate having to spend my very limited time trying to make the program do things I am sure it can do. I don't mind printing a users manual from a readme file but the readme file appears to be only for trouble shooting. I would not recommend this program simple because of the lack of documentation available.
1,Avoid This Product,"While PhotoSuite 4.0 has some interesting features, it's quirks outweigh any benefits they might offer.On the plus side: it's guides to enhancing and cropping photos are simple and straightforward -- but then, so are most of the better imaging software.On the negative side: when you create an album of photos, the pictures remain where they originally were stored on your hard drive. Which makes uploading them to a printing service (say, Ofoto) extremely complicated, difficult and frustrating. Further, because of this approach it is easy to erase a picture unintentionally.Also of note: to talk to a support technician will cost you...!! So if you do have problems, the cost of getting help is nearly as much as the software itself.I'm back on Amazon to find decent imaging software. Not only can't I recommend PhotoSuite, but based on the problems I've had with other Roxio products, I can't recommend the company either."
1,"Weak product, difficult to use","I have used this product for a year now, and am very disappointed with its performance and ease of use.I move on to Paintshop pro."
1,Disappointed,"I was replacing my (corruted) MGI photosuite with this product and was gravely disappointed. I couldn't do simple retrievals from clip art discs and found the online help worthless. I threw it away the next day, chalked it up as a cheap mistake, and bought Photo Explosion instead."
5,brand new contemporary large 4pc microfiber khaki sectional,"brand new contemporary large 4pc microfiber khaki sectional 2,000.00 dollars get it the best furniture to get"
5,What a unique idea!,Adorable! My little one seems to enjoy the book! I have already read it to her 4 times. It's a cute introduction to Wall Street. I want my child to learn about financial matters early so this book was exactly what I have been looking for.
4,Neiko Tools Magnetic Pick-up Tood and Inspection Mirror Set,"The photo for this looks like it's a telescoping magnifying glass. That's the product appliance technicians need. There is no such thing on the market here. Please consider making one. It is very difficult to see the model numbers on some appliances and to see into appliances sometimes to see if there is a little leak or break - That would be a great item. In the meantime, I'll have to make one - thank goodness for duct tape."
5,A Landmark of bibliography,"This bibliography of Thomas B. Mosher, one of the more interesting actors in the printing and graphic arts at the turn of the 20th century, is an essential tool for collectors, librarians, and book dealers. The author's meticulous, compulsive even, research uncovered much new information, both bibliographic and biographic, and presents a stunningly complete picture of the man, Mosher, and his importance. Bishop investigates, and throw much needed new light on, Mosher's reputation as a ""literary pirate."" Equally important Bishop examines Mosher's ""graphic piracy"" and identifies many of the artists, mostly British, whose designs were used by Mosher, often without attribution. Finally Bishop establishes Mosher's importance in disseminating, in America, the works of many known and unknown British writers. The appendices at the back of the book are, alone, worth the price of the book."
2,Horrible acidic taste and only 4 servings per bottle,The aloe vera that I get from wholefoods (sorry don't know brand) tastes soooo much better than this brand and you just put in one cap full into water so each bottle is like 15 servings. This only comes with 4 servings so although is cheaper per bottle is much more expensive. I'm making a trip to wholefoods tomorrow to buy my previous brand.
5,Excelente,"Este producto es fantastico para el cuerpo humano, tiene mucho beneficios, aunque no estoy segura si es 100% aloe vera."
3,"Prairie Collection 5-Drawer Chest, Country Pine",It's okay but I have yet to put it together because I cannot find the directions to do so. Can you mail me another copy of the assembly instructions?
3,Don't order,I was very disappointed in this product. It is very cheaply made. I was really surprised. If it wouldn't take so much time I would have sent it back.
3,Southshore chest,"Purchased the 5 drawer chest manufactured by Southshore furniture. Overall okay for the price. It's made out of particle board, but the back and drawer bottoms are cardboard! Very weak and unsturdy. I replaced the drawer bottoms and back with wood paneling. Also, the packaging it was bundled in was all falling apart by the time it arrived."
1,Piece of Junk - Don't buy,"Since I've purchased this a couple of months ago, I have had to do constant repairs, nailing pieces together. The drawers are flimsy and the bottoms fall out. The frame spreads apart and I had to nail it together so it would be tighter and the drawers would stay on their track. Given the amount of time and aggravation I have spent on this, I can say that this piece of junk is no bargain. Save your money."
4,Good product for the price,I found this dresser to be easy to put together and for the price it is good quality. I would recommend it. I put the whole thing together myself (32 yr old female in less than great shape) and it while it took a few hours to complete I wasn't exactly rushing it. The instructions were to easy to follow and I didn't have any problems.
1,save yourself money and headache,i purchased 2 dressers and 2 twin 3 drawer bed base and all 4 were broken so bad we couldnt even piece 1 together with all the parts. and when we went to return all 4 very heavy items amazon says we have to pay to have them sent back and it may be 4 weeks before our $617.00 is returned. if you really want these walmart carries them online and at least you could return them to a local store without paying shipping. we desided not to even try to have the manufacterer send replacement parts as we have read other reviews no one ever recieves them anyway. disapointed is a understatement. can't wait to see how much it will cost me to ship almost 400 lbs back.its been 7 days since i was told to wait for email on when ups would be picking up our return.
1,Piece of junk,The box arrived absolutely smashed! Parts were missing and the top was broken across the complete width. I am still waiting for replacement parts!I am very disappointed.P.S.The replacement piece arrived with smashed ends! Ugh!
4,Great purchase,The price was great on this dresser and the quality of the finished product amazed me. I'm so happy I took a chance and bought this for my room
3,Not What It Appears to Be,"We just received this book in preparation for our trip to Scotland in May. We're disappointed. The only establishments included in the main body of the book are those which pay for the entry. There is a comprehensive list of all STB Approved properties in the back, but it's just that--a list, with no details. The (free) online listings at VisitScotland are more complete and easier to use."
1,It didn't help at all,"I'm 46 and over the past 2-3 years I started having increasing difficulty sleeping, thinning hair, getting too warm at night, depression,Decreases libido, mornjng anxiety, decreased concentration, fatigue, ...all the symptoms of low progesterone. I had a slew of blood tests including thyroid which were all normal. My doctor suggested to try done progesterone cream so I bought a progesterone cream at Henry's/Boneys about 6 minths ago that helped me so much but ran out and empty container was thrown out, and can't recall what the brand was. I went back to buy more but didn't see it on their shelves. Then i tried this product. I purchased two jars and have used this product for 3 months now. My symptoms have not improved. In fact they are worse. This product didnt do anything at all to help. I know there is a cream that was effective but this one wasn't at all."
5,Wow,You know i read the hype about this product where one woman says that its effectiveness is based on how much you believe it is going to work. Well im here to tell you this stuff works. I used it after taking a shower and putting on some tight jeans to go to work. Not tight as in the streach jeans but the regular jeans. And when i got home my tummy had went down completly. I was floored. I still use it on other areas and I didnt get all nasty with the guys at work like i usually do. I am going to buy some for my mom. This is Great stuff.
1,disapointing,I used the cream for a month with no results. I have not slept in 9 months and the scale keeps moving up by itself! I was sadly disapointed.I was very intriged by Dr. John Lee's work. Maybe I am more estrogen dominant and it will take longer to work. I will continue to use it longer if only for its anti cancer effects.
2,Be very careful and use ONLY under advice of a professional!!,"I heard about this type of cream on the Dr Oz show and took it upon myself to purchase it without reading further or talking to my medical DR. I had a friend tell me you need to start even lower than what directions state and work your way up.Still, while following all directions, within a week I had such side effects! I felt even worse than I had before I tried it.Hormones are definitely not something to play with without a professional's advice/guidance as we are all unique, have our own unique issues, hormonal imbalances, take different meds or vitamin supplements and this is not one-size-fits-all!USE WITH CAUTION UNDER THE ADVICE OF A PROFESSIONAL!!"

4,The Cold Wind,"This story is heart-warming and touching. It is about a girl who does a whole-make-over due to her father's encouragement, from a unpopular geek to a popular girl in her high-school.Her father is always the one who would be there when she needed him, her mother is always busy with her work and is not very close to her.Whenever the cold wind blows onto her, she knows something bad is going to happen. She loses her father and is feeling totally lost. She has tried comitting suicide a few times,but is always stopped by her friends. Would she push away the past or remain sad and depressed? Only her boyfriend can help her."
4,Excellent Value-Very good mix of Bob's movies,This has 10 Bob Hope movies and 4 are newly restored:Road to RioRoad To BaliSon Of Paleface (with Roy Rogers and Trigger)My Favorite BrunetteMy girlfriend didn't realize that Bob was this funny with his one-liners in Road to Bali. Even if you don't like all the movies in this collection I would still suggest buying this as it is less expensive than a movie matinee and considering the era I would say at least there are 3 of the movies that really stand out. Good quality DVD's and nice packaging.
3,Ehh.. I loved it at first,I loved it at first. But then it seemed to get a little thick n harder to spread n to get smooth. Also as it got thick it took longer to dry n i could scratch it off when it was supose to be dry. I feel it does harden and that's what I love about it. This is my second Sally Hansen product that I have bought that has gotten thick. I also think this product may be the reason my nail polish would come off in sheets when used as a basecoat. I have mixed feelings about this product. But the price is great which makes it disposable without hurting your wallet. So its ok even if I'm only able to get usage of about only half the bottle.
1,doesn't last,this stuff doesn't last a day.....it chips and comes off way too easy.......I don't want to reapply nail polish in the middle of the day! Why does it not last through hand washings? I hate it. Waste of money.
1,Terrible,This polish is the absolute worst! It take forever to dry and is very sticky. It didnt harden anything! It's also easy to peel off! Save your money and invest in opi or essie!
3,Almost great,"I really enjoyed the instrumentals on this album a great deal, but the vocals killed it for me which is why I give this a 3. He sounds like Jamie Jasta with a sore throat, and I don't even like Jasta's voice in the first place.The vocalist attempts to do death metal vocals but cannot reach the deep pitches required for them, thus sounding kinda weak and hollow. A good example of death metal vocals pulled off properly would be Black Dahlia Murder. I would have gave this album a 4 or even a 5 if the vocals were not so annoying. If Dead to Fall got a new vocalist they would be 10 times better."
4,chicago style metalcore!,"Dead to fall's second full length album tittled ""Villainy and Virtue"" is the perfect blend of swedish metal and hardcore. if you buy this cd and play it in your room you might find that your roommate will mosh around by himself like a total nerd. It's sort of understandable though and Dead to Fall's intention was probably to make you mosh, one song is actually tittled ""ready, set, circle pit!""This album is as good if not better than their last. they had a bit of a line up change and you can get a sense of that from the new cd. I'd say their new drummer does an awesome job, he tears it up with the double bass and blast beats. Dead to Fall is definitely one of the best bands from chicago and this album shows that."
3,DTF....not the same?,"okay I love DTF a lot their old cd is one of the greatest creation ever made in my opinion but in this cd there is some good songs in ""Villiany and Virtue"" i love the cd but it gets boring quick it doesn't have the same thing as ""Everything You Touch Falls Into Pieces"" cause I can listen to that album over and over and don't get bored of it but in VAV I do and those instrumental songs nothing wrong with it but their like 2 or 3 I believe and come on! give us more music and less instrumental but the good thing about it they haven't changed that much from last cd to their newer one so that's good just those instrumental and some of the songs other than that all good!"
4,Great thermostat,"I had this thermostat for about a month on a new furnace before replacing it with a TH7500D so I could have 7 day program-ability. It kept very even temps and is fairly easy to operate.Be forewarned however that the ease or difficulty of the installation has almost nothing to do with the thermostat itself. It is determined by the equipment you have installed and the manner in which they were installed. Have a simple furnace wired using the standard scheme and it will be 15min easy. Have a heat pump with a two-stage fossil fuel backup,two stage AC that was installed by a non-conformist plumber and it may take a while to sort out. Use the labels include to label the wires as they are removed from the old. If your equipment or wire combo isn't in the install instructions call tech support.You must use the manual to program it the first time because the screen just shows you a code that means nothing without the manual."
4,Very intuitive,"Great product. I have bought several but have returned them...reason, unless you have the manual with some you cant program them. This one is intuitive. Only reason I marked it a 4, is that it does not have a back light that is on all the time. So if you want to walk by and check the temp, you have to hit a button to turn on the light. Make sure you hit the right button when you do that."
5,Great product,"After reading everything on Amazon and ensuring that this would work with my heat pump, I made the jump and bought it... no regrets! Operationally, this thing is ideal - easy to program, easy to override (two different ways) and just easy to understand. Installation was left to a pro -- I'm pretty savy but the last thermostat was installed by a contractor that didn't know what he was doing and I wasn't comfortable knowing which wires were which. No regrets.The HVAC contractor commented that this was a VERY good unit."
3,Not a 2 stage product as described,"This product is the honeywell TH6110 model, not the honeywell TH6220 model like it states in the title. Please be aware that the item I received is a 1H/1C thermostat, and if you have a heat pump there's a 90 percent chance this won't work, and then you'll have to pay to have it shipped back because it does state in the desciption it's a TH6110.Apparently Amazon is horrible about decribing their products, so I thought I'd give a heads up for this one. From now on when I buy something on Amazon I guess I'll have to go to the manufacturer's website to get the correct description.Update:The seller agreed to pay for the return shipping, so I upped my review to 3 stars. Just have to be aware not all reviews on Amazon are accurate."
3,Found the installation manual at this link....,"[...]Probably several other places as well.I certainly wouldn't call it a cakewalk to install.If that link doesn't work just search: ""Th6220 pdf""...........................................................Link didn't post. You can find the manuals at the Honeywell website.It looks doable but you really need to know your system before you start.If I was going to try to install it I'd try to also download the manual for the one your replacing and work thr connections out before hand."
2,Has NO indicator light to show operation,"Better thermostats have an LED that turns red when calling for heat, and turns green when calling for air-conditioning. With this simple feature you able to tell what the heat / air conditioner is doing from 50 feet away, day or night.This important feature is missing from this thermostat."
3,Dosage Not listed on purchasing page:(,"I just received my bottle in the mail today. Instructions"" 3 capsels, 3X day"". I would have ordered more if the 100 caps are only gong to last a little over a month. I'll update my review once I take the product, but wanted others to know what they are buying. Also, other ingredients; Gelatin."
3,It was great in it's time,"""Father McCarthy Smokes a Pipe and Speaks In Tongues"" was an important ecumenical book in the early 1970s. It was written by a traditional pentecostal preacher in South Bend, IN, who watched the goings on at the University of Notre Dame. At the time, pentecostals considered the Catholic Church the ""Whore of Babyelon"" and how could God's work go on there? Remember, the pentecostals were part of the holiness tradition so smoking, drinking, and dancing were verboten. However, God was speaking in a powerful way in the CATHOLIC Church and this author recognized it."
2,Corporate greed is the greater danger to healthcare,"While Author Callahan's book highlights a critique of what could be termed the ""politically correct"" pursuit of research, there is a greater danger here that deserves more attention. Corporations are driving the research for pharmaceuticals and treatments that will maximize their stock price. Far more is compromised when healthcare is driven by profit than by excessive altruism.Without doubt the healthcare system of the US is in great trouble. I just don't think Callahan has found the source of the biggest problem."
1,"WHAT EVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!!!","I didn't get the camera from amazon. Mine came with a pinter. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK! Batteries never lasted more than a day wether the we rechargeables or not. That's even if i could get the stupid thing to stay on or turn on at all. I even sent it back and got a new one from the company and that one was worse than the first one!!!!!!!!!!! Buyer beware: Cheap and not worth the headache."
2,Don't Buy Reconditioned,"Purchased two cameras. Scratches on both, one doesn't work at all. Never buy reconditioned products."
5,Good Service to Go Along with a Good Camera,"I have a feeling that if A. Rodriguez had to replace his camera after almost 2 months, it probably means that there was something with HIS camera not the actual model. I have this camera and it works perfectly fine and I have no complaints. When the flash loads, it takes at the most 5 seconds to do so (and just when you take the first picture after turning on your camera, not at any other time) and when taking a picture, it takes 2 seconds do so at the regular setting. Just tonight I had a ""problem"" with this camera and I went to HP's support and troubleshooting at www.hp.com and they, true to their word, replied in an hour and helped solve the ""problem"" which turned out to not be a problem at all. He told me how to fix it by changing the ISO Speed, White Balance, and EV Compensation and everything was how it was supposed to be. I definently recommend this camera."
4,used book for the iccp database administration exam,"This was a good introductory book about all the differentterms and concepts in generic database administration.This book does more to cover from the managers perspective of all theextra stuff that managers would think about in terms of dataloss, disaster recovery, recovery, etc."
4,Database Administration: The Complete Guide to Practices and Procedures,Database Administration: The Complete Guide to Practices and Procedures was delivered sucessfully. I enjoy the book.
1,Blade Does Not Measure Up to Its Claims,"I work at a foundry where we have to cut ceramic tiles to various lengths when putting sand molds together. I bought this blade based on the manufacturer's claim that its life will be 350x longer than conventional ceramic saw blades. Not true. It did not even last as long as one of the blades we normally use (""Norton"" brand that we buy from Home Depot for $6.27 each). Fortunately, I did not pay regular price for this blade -- I'm only out $49.00 plus shipping. Let the buyer beware: this blade does not measure up to the claims made by the manufacturer."
5,VERY helpful!!,"I ordered this study guide to go along with my OB text book, and it has been very helpful, I finished this class with an A."
3,ok??,It wasn't bad and it helped put together what we were studying. I wish they would put out a study guide that just had the answers right next to the question rather than looking to the back of the book. It was too much information to keep going back and forth I ended up coping and taping the answers underneath the questions.
1,Are you kidding?,"DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ANYONE TO BUY THIS, WHEN WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS ON THIS DVD?PLEASE LIST THE EPISODES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS DVD"
1,Plastic Junk toy clock,I tried Atomix's 555 Atomic office clock in 6 locations at two sites 43 miles apart and it never did receive a clear signal.
1,I HAVE A KITCHEN CLOCK WALL OUTLET(BUILT-IN),"I KNOW THERE IS A MARKET FOR THIS.I AM ONE WHO WOULD BUY IT. MANY IF NOT AN AWFUL LOT OF APARTMENTS,HOUSES,AND CONDOMINIUMS HAVE BUILT IN WALL SOCKETS FOR KITCHEN CLOCKS. I DO NOT APPRECIATE THE INAVAILABILITY OF A WALL CLOCK(ATOMIC CLOCK) THAT YOU CAN NOT PLUG IN AND UTILIZE COMMON HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICITY.THEY BUILT A SOCKET IN THESE KITCHENS TO PLUG A CLOCK IN.I USE BATTERYS WHEN I NEED TO.IF I HAVE A SOCKET RIGHT THERE IHAVE NO DESIRE TO USE A BATTERY OPERATED DEVICE.IT COMPLICATES MY LIFE MORE THAN IT ALREADY IS.I AM ALSO HANDICAPPED AND DO NOT APPRECIATE THE EXTRA WORK INVOLVED WITH CHANGING BATTERYS.ESPECIALLY WITH AN ATOMIC CLOCK DESIGNED TO ELLIMINATE THE HASSLES OF SETTING THE TIME AND DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME AND ALL.IT IS A FURTHER HASSLE TO CHANGE BATTERYS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS A PLUG RIGHT THERE."
5,Another great band from Michigan,"From the opening moans to the last atonal guitar chord this CD rocks in true Mule style. A worthy follow-up to their eponymous first album and 4 song EP. The raw power evoked in the grating vocals, twanging, crunchy guitar, and disjointed rhythm section can't be denied."
2,I'm Scared Now,"Well I must say, I ordered this software as a Christmas gift for my man who is an avid coin collector and seller. I found this software and thought it would be PERFECT for him. I received the order within days so the delivery was very timely, but I gotta say I'm terrified now based on these reviews that he's going to hate it! I am shocked by the statement a gentleman made about the photos they provide of coins (or lack thereof I should say) and the complete lack of tech support!! I hope he find's the software useful...if not I'll have to spent $100 on the really good software (carlisledevelopment.com) and don't really wanna do that if it's not absolutely necessary. I'll write a more comprehensive review once he has had an opportunity to use it after Christmas!!"
4,Need realistic expectations...,"Just bought CoinManage 2011; not as bad as many other reviews claim. Yes, some of the images are incorrect, and the values for some coins aren't always correct or entirely up to date. That said, it is CONSIDERABLY better than most other programs that are currently available! It is a reasonable program for the price; you have to realize that they aren't selling millions of copies of the software, so they can't hire a team of programmers to make it as slick and bug free as we all might like. Pretty easy to correct the problems by entering your own values and images. Overall, pretty good software for creating an inventory of your collection."
1,Very Disappointed !!!,"Richards comment says it all. I've also been a Coin Manage user for many years. It was a pretty good application with a couple updates a year. Then all of a sudden no updates, no 2010 version, no answers to questions. Then they came out with the 2011 version. I purchased it thinking that my coin values would be updated, nope, I was wrong. Some coins were added, but the values are the same as the 2009 version. Still no answer to questions, some coins you can't assign any values to them, you have to go elsewhere find the value and enter it in manually. It's a good software if you are not planning on having your coin values updated, but I'm also going to look elsewhere. It was a waste of my $$$ to update to the 2011 version. In my opinion, the company has gone downhill and support is non-existent, a waste of time.If anyone has any suggestions for a replacement, I'd very much like to hear some opinions."
1,Save Your Money,Bought this program and am thoroughly disgusted. They don't answer your e-mails and support is NON-EXISTENT. I think they must be going out of business.Like I sad. Save your money.
5,Coin Manage 2008,"Coin Manage 2008 is really a complete software package, that allows not only us and canadian coins but many foriegn coins as well. You can even upload pics of your coins and link your coins to book values. Great product"
1,English teachers nightmare,"You would think that with the name ""official dictionary"" , it would use proper english that we were taught in school. I cannot believe some of the words that are in this book. My English teachers would not like to know that there is a source out there teaching opposite lessons that they are fighting for children to learn. Examples: the multiple of sock is not sox and I never heard of very used as verier. It drives me crazy to see some of the words in this dictionary. Uh is a sound not a word, if it is then why isn't arg in the dictionary too?"
3,Scrabble Dictionary,"Nice try, but no ""Horse Shoes.""Excellent Book, but many ""current"" words are NOT contained; needs to reflect more than one single definition.This can lead to many argumentative issues."
2,The dumbing down of Scrabble,Every and anything is a word in this dictionary. Get a Webster's and play for real.
3,In the middle about this not because the book is bad,"It is a Scrabble dictionary, just what it says it is, no problem there but when I ordered it it charged a higher mailing rate for some reason and I ended up spending more on the S & H than the actual item, which irritated me."
5,Good for the price,"I got this dictionary because the regular one doesn't have a lot of the words that are allowed in scrabble, so for the price it's a great buy."
4,Useful but not complete....,"This is definitely a useful reference for Scrabble games but should not be considered the final authority for legal Scrabble words. Use it as a supplement to other dictionaries. If you need a lightweight, portable Scrabble dictionary, this is probably IT, but with the limitations stated above."
4,It was time to replace my old one!,"After using our Scrabble dictionary from the 70's for many years, we realized we were missing lots of new words! The other book was practically held together by duct tape. (We don't exactly play by the rules; we can look up words AHEAD of time) This book will last us another 30 years! I'm very glad to have it. I like the size of the print also."
1,Incompleted,This dictionary does not include words over 9 letters long and does not include common words that might be considered vulgar.This is an incomplete resource and it is not suitable for serious Scrabble players.
5,Love this Dictionary,I love this game (when I win) and the dictionary has become our best friend and has settled many arguments. We prefer the large print. This is an asset to all our eyes.
3,Official scrabble players dictionary - e book,"I like having the up to date dictionary on my iPad. The font is large enough to see easily. On a negative note, it's more difficult to find words because of the constant scrolling and inability to get to the page I want without a lot of effort. I cannot hone in on a word with ease. I find I don't use the dictionary as often because of the difficulty in finding what I want."
4,Would have rathered the paperback version,This item is a great improvement over the last edition and the font is a nice size. My only disappointment is with Amazon; I wish the paperback version had come up in my initial search because I definitely would have preferred that version for ease of use over the cumbersome hardcover.This isn't the first time this has happened when doing an Amazon search; I find that you often have to look harder for paperback. Make the effort because it's worth the savings.
4,very good overall,"I think this scrabble dictionary is wonderful, however, I am concerned about the durability and portability of it. The container may not outlast the content and it is a bit awkward to take to Scrabble clubs.Otherwise, very good! I should have ordered the hardback but did not realize it would be quite so large."
4,Great gifts!,"It was a gift for my brother and he loved it. I always appreciate the condition of the things that I purchase. I would. Love more made in the USA, products."
3,Need Bigger Print,"Very helpful with my games. Unfortunately, the print is a bit too small for my view. Otherwise, I would recommend it."
3,BEWARE KINDLE VERSION!!,"Remember that Kindle is very good at what it was designed to do...READ...not search. The Table of Contents consists of each letter of the alphabet. Therefore, if you're looking for a word starting with"" SMA"" you will need to go to the TOC, click the ""S"" to go to the start of the ""S"" words, and then page forward until you get to the SMA's. That takes a while...long enough that it's really not worth it."
3,Scrabble Dictionary,I purchased this book and it took over two weeks to get it and I was kind of dissapointed with the looks of it. It looked ver old and the pages were yellow and it looked nothing like the picture. The copyright was 1978. It is useable but ugly.
3,dont think that it's comprehensive !,"It has most words, but leaves out too many. For example ( noni , goji, fainty and trime ). Many more but can't think of them right off hand. Don't rely on this dictionary alone. Keep the computer handy . (dictionary.com)"
2,Many words in reg dictionary not in this one.,This book has BI QI and numerous other words not accepted in a normal dictionary. But I have found many words in other dictionaries not in this one. So I felt betrayed. However it makes the game more fun. But not enough effort went into it.
3,Official Scrabble Players Dictionary,"Absolutely great book in great condition. Only thing that was unexpected, was that the paperback was definately not as complete as the hard cover book and I really wanted (and needed) everything the hard cover book had. I guess there's no way to know that until you receive the book. But the book came within a couple of days of my ordering it and everything else was great!"
3,Official Scrabble Players' Dictionary,"An interesting collection of words you never hear before and alternative spellings of words you have heard. I would not use it as the only dictionary when playing, because the word choice is limited and the spellings are bizarre. It does not contain many of the words used in everyday language. It is good to use when you have letters that you think you cannot use to make a word!"
3,Too many strange words,This dictionary includes so many odd word choices that almost anything goes. It is more fun playing with an everyday-type dictionary.
4,Scrabble for all,"Who can live without this Scrabble Dictionary? My husband and I (in our 80s) play almost everynight, but love the help of the dictionary. It is a challenge to find new words (and say we're learning something new.)"
3,"good to have, but Search function way too slow","I got this for Kindle Fire to search out definitions of unfamiliar words that come up in playing one player mode vs computer. Helps to remember the words for future use & what they ""take"" -- i.e plurals, verb conjugations, adjectival forms, etc. However, can't do in course of game. The Search function is maddeningly slow. Starts from 'a' & scans whole database A to Z every time a new search is initiated. So it's progressively worse depending on where the initial letter stands in the alphabet -- i.e. 't' worse than 'd' with xyz the worst.Searching hard copy easier."
4,Great little book,This is a great little book if you want to tone up your word skills. It is nice because it is small enough that you can take it with you.
3,"Okay, but could be better","What I like is that it looks up partial (i.e. ""arti"" and finds all instances of those letters.On the down side, it is a bit slow in finding those instances. Also, when finding whole words, it again finds all the forms of that word, which make it a little cumbersome to use if you want to find only those instances.Useful for slow"
5,Re: The Offical Scrabble Players Dictionary,The dictionary for scrabble players was a very good and very much needed investment. My husband and I always end up arguing about if this word or that word is legal to use in the game...Now I can bet him and smile when he challenges me or we challenge one another in a game and the word is or isn't in the dictionary. I rated this product as a 5 because it was worth it and what I we really needed. Once again Amazon us saved me or rather us again...Thanks
4,"Once you lift it, it's a pretty neat resource...","My wife and I probably get in 10 Scrabble games a week, and we used to trade off any of four dictionaries: two paperbacks, a hardcover crossword puzzle reference, and a 1942 hardcover. I bought this one, in soft covers and large print, because we are both over 60 and benefit from larger type. It is awkward to pass across the table, but once dipped into, this becomes fascinating. We are not game fanatics, so the criticisms some reviewers have seem petty to us. Frankly, I don't even like to use words I never heard spoken or used in a sentence or can't imagine ever seeing in print outside of the covers of this dictionary, but when a win is on the line, I am flexible enough to abandon principles. Any normal ""social player"" will find this volume sufficient and the former dictionaries returned to the shelf."
3,The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary Large Print Edition,"This dictionary is current with the new words and very easy to read; however it is large, heavy, and difficult to handle!The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary"
3,Not so easy to use,"I was disappointed to find that it is hard to find what you want in the kindle books in general. I have an older version of the Scrabble Dictionary in paper form and it's far easier to find the words when I want to do that. This is very time consuming. Just a time waster if you ask me, even though it has the newer words."
1,This is a joke.,"I played Scrabble at a friend's house using the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary for the first time the other day--in my family we use theOED. This ""dictionary"" is a joke. Suppose somebody else had layed down ""ut"", and you have BEFLRTY. You decide to play ""butterfly"" to get the 50 point bonus for using all seven of your letters. Your opponent, being more familiar with the dictionary than you are, challenges and wins.If you play with this dictionary, butterfly is not a legal word. I could list other words it doesn't have, but I think you get the point."
3,Not a definitive reference,"Some of the foreign words (latin, french, italian, etc.) and many other words permitted by the rules of Scrabble are not found in this ""official"" dictionary. I was frustrated by the fact that words that were within the rules of Scrabble were not found in this dictionary when challenged by other players. We now use Webster."
4,entertaining reference,"Official Scrabble dictionary makes for interesting reading due to all of the words the reader probably never heard of before or even thought of as real words. However, it is not a complete dictionary and should be used in conjunction with a volume that covers more commonplace words."
4,Scrabble Players Must Have,The men in our family are avid scabble players- Every time we get together for holidays they play - so this past Christmas I bought the Official Scrabble Dictionary for each of the guys - What a great gift!! They didn't have to wait for the 30 year old dictionary to be passed around (they play by their own rules)- The only mistake I made was not purchasing a guest copy - Amazon Rocks!!
2,scrabble dictionary and scrabble turntable,"With shipping I paid about $9.00 for my scrabble dictionary. The price on the end backing of book is $7.50. I did not do very well. I should have checked product price before ordering. I will not be so quick to order again. I also ordered a scrabble turntable that was in poor condition, missing letters, no string for the bag to hold letters, box taped together. Very unhappy with my first order."
1,terrible dictionary,"This is the worst excuse for a dictionary I have ever seen. The words they include are not words, but madeup slang which are NOT words. BOOCOO is NOT acceptable for beaucoup. And it goes on and on and downhill from here. It is a total waste of money.DO NOT SPEND YOUR $$$ ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH....."
1,Missing Words!!,"The first day I used this dictionary, I found a missing word. ""Alleviate"" and it's derivatives, are not listed. Inexcusable!"
1,I asked for a refund,"It's probably my fault for expecting something different. For a scrabble dictionary, I expected acceptable words to be ordered first by length from two to eight characters, second by alphabet. This is not the case in this 'official' dictionary, which disappointed me to the extend that I asked for a refund."
4,Scrabble dictionary,"This is a great addition to your scrabble. Very easy to use, especially for the younger players (or even us older ones)."
5,Great purchase,The book is very useful when playing Scrabble. We use it every time we play whenever there is a challenge. It has all words 7 letters or less acceptable for Scrabble. The book arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
3,Nice to have around to prevent squabbles.,"I like to have this around so that there is an ""official"" dictionary. Sometimes my loved ones cannot agree on using another dictionary, and it is easy to say, ""Well, this is THE Scrabble Dictionary,"" and put an end to debate.One could go without this dictionary and use any old dictionary, but if your clan has a competitive streak it is useful."
4,display setup,i dislike the way it is formatted. it is confusing. you cant tell what letter you're at until you stop the slide. its a guessing game until you stop. i still dont really care for the set up but i have learned a way around my tablet.
4,"It's useful,.",I've enjoyed using this dictionary. It's well-organized and I especially like the indexes at the back featuring really hard-to-find words.
4,Scrabble Players dictionary,Good resource of words..nice that it includes a brief definition so you can learn something too!
3,One of the Strangest Dictionaries I've Ever Read,"This dictionary has many words I have never seen before. It has alternate spellings of most words and for some, brief definitions. I did not think it was legal to use non-English words in Scrabble, but this dictionary has quite a few words from other languages, such as Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, and many others. It isn't useful outside of Scrabble, but it is an interesting read if you like to discover new, strange words."
4,A Welcome Helper!,I use this dictionary daily-- whenever I play Words with Friends. It has been a G-dsend teaching me the art of two letter words. My only complaint is that some words in the dictionary are not recognized on Words with Friends.
5,Just what I needed!,I am just getting into the game and this dictionary is perfect!!! I am learningnew words all the time. This book helps to settle many a question.
5,Scrabble Dictionary,Very Happy with this useful book for Scrabble players.Nice condition and fast shipping
4,"The Official Scrabble Dictionary, 4th Ed.",It's an official dictionary by Merriam-Webster.....lots of wordstype is relatively small
3,Disappointed,"Wanting a pristine copy for a gift I choose to buy NEW rather than USED. When it arrived it was flawed; a large crease ran the length of the cover that obviously occurred prior to the lamination process. This should have been sold as a ""second"". If I hadn't needed it right away I would have returned it. I ended up offering the gift with apologies. Wishing I'd bought a used ""good condition"" I'm left feeling a little ripped off."
2,Official Scrabble Players Dictionary,This edition of the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary had words and letters way too small for the seniors who used it for their Scrabble Tournament. I would have liked this paperback book in a much larger print. Next time I will be more careful in choosing a purchase such as this.
4,Official Scrabble Players Dictionary,This was a gift to my 82 year old sister who is an avid Scrabble player. Makes her a hard person to beat now!
5,Makes the game very Instructive,Love my Official Scrabble Dictionary. I have learned so many new words.Is worth every cent!
1,Word Search Not Included in Kindle Edition,"I am an avid Scrabble player and was very excited to purchase THE OFFICIAL SCRABBLE PLAYERS DICTIONARY to use on my Kindle Fire. I was looking forward to having the definitions of the words. However, I was very disappointed to find that it is practically worthless as a Kindle edition. The reason for that is the only way to find a word is to ""Go To"" ""Front Matter"" and then select a letter of the alphabet and then painstakingly page through endless pages to find your word! The only search option is location 14573 etc. Ridiculous!! This is a dictionary but how does one search for a specific word??? Very disappointing and basically worthless as a kindle dictionary. I returned mine for a refund.I'm waiting impatiently for a word search option....."
4,"Serves its purpose, but very heavy/bulky","Book serves its purpose, but for scrabble-players who like to carry the board around with ourselves to coffee shops on the weekends, the dictionary is way too heavy and cumbersome to lug around as well."
4,Official Scrabble dictionary,"The Webster based New Scrabble Dictionary was needed because language continues to evolve and add as well as subtract words. The ""X"", ""Q"" and ""Y"" are problematic and I am always looking for new usage words and this helped. It came in as advertised ""used, but good condition""."
4,Great way to purchase books and not spend a lot of $$$.,"I have always been happy with my purchases from Amazon and Barnes & Nobel books. This was more of the same great service. I give them an A+ for their service and honesty. When purchasing used items, you expect to see a flaw sometimes, but as of this time I see no flaws and will continue to shop with you and your company."
4,good,Much needed for keeping things official on scrabble. Should be included in the box when you buy the game.
4,Good,I started playing words with friends and this came in very handy. Definitely a vocabulary builder. Great book thats easy to use!
3,"It looks like a handy reference, but I'm not qualified to rate it.",I purchased this as a gift for someone else. I do not play Scrabble so cannot give it a fair rating. It arrived in very good time and in excellent condition.
3,Just like the paperback!,"An essential tool for any serious Scrabble player, but without search ability it is more difficult to use than the paperback."
4,Scrabble Dictionary,Very helpful. a bit heavy when traveling but worth it. I use it as a teaching project for the children to help look up words as I'm on the computer
4,A Must,"There are some words that I am sure of the spelling but my husband questions. Then he looks in the dictionary and voila, there it is."
3,The Offical Scrabble Players Dictionary,"Generally helpful but, lacks in depth meanings of some of the words. Better than using the regular dictionary."
3,scrabble fan,"This book is very handy, however we're looking for a different one. I do agree with the person who said that there are so many odd words that almost anything goes. I was a librarian and there were some words that I was convinced were not real ""words"" - Agentry for example! In other dictinaries they aren't listed but they are in this book. We bought the paperback version - not the large print. That was a mistake because it's very small print and it takes forever to find a word. However, we're big scrabble fans and use it often but since finding the word agentry we may throw it away. If you have great eyesight and like the strange words, then it's a good buy. However, I would recommend the hardback or the large print paperback."
5,Scrabble Dictionary received quickly,I sent this as a gift and it was received in excellent condition and very timely. Thanks.
4,The official scrabble players dictionary- large print edition,"The dictionary is great. Easy to read the large print, so no need to take glasses on and off during play. One drawback is that the book is very heavy, even though it is a paperback edition."
4,Scrabble?,"My wife (American) and I (British) find it invaluable to have two dictionaries - one British English and the other a 'cheaters guide' to incorrect spelling! Seriously, we do find that we often refer to our respective dictionaries for words that are less well known.Wife's review: You wouldn't believe the 'cheater' words that are in that limey dictionary. ""Owt""? ""Nowt""? Puh-leeez. Seriously, we do learn a lot from both dictionaries. Might call them ""marital aids."" :-)"
4,A Standard Reference Book,We ordered it to support our word searches during our long winter evening family bouts of Scrabble. Also discovered it's fun to browse at other times. It doesn't earn 5 stars only because of the stiff binding that makes it a bit awkward....or we could force-break the binding and eventually lose pages.
5,Love this game,"I got all my friends and my husband addicted to this game! It is fun and different than most trivia shows. The host is funny, sarcastic and sometimes a bit crude but for adults is a good fun game. We love playing this!"
5,"Great Game, Great Seller",Game arrived ahead of schedule and in great condition. Wonderful customer service from seller.
3,Reliable,Is excellent when viewed on large TV for large party. Definitely provided an oppportunity to keep things alive and prove who the smart people really are.
4,"clear and concise,abundant examples","One of my favourite reference of the language. While it is clear and concise, the book does not rush into yes-or-no conclusions in dealing with ambiguities or controversies. It states both the stances of puritans and iconoclausts of the grammar rules with abundant real life examples so that the users can decide for themselves. Clear cut inappropriate examples are marked with crosses, ambiguous usages with single question marks(?) and highly doubtful ones with double question marks(??). Simple language, easy to understand."
4,Well Written.Adequate for the ACRC 11.3 exam,"This was the only book i used to prepare for the test. The book maps topics covered directly to the ACRC11.3 objectives. I can't agree more with Ruslan Moskalenko's review of 05/11/y2k. I passed the exam with a very high margin. My advise is for you to use this book, try the sample exam (exhaust all questions in study card mode) and try one or two exam preps on the internet. Good Luck !"
1,very very poor book,I have taken and failed acrc twice using this book.Pls don't waste your money. This book is very bad.I just bought laura's book and will study it for about 6 weeks and hopefully will pass then.Forget about the cd in the book it's way off from the test. This is a very difficult test.Good luck.
4,Excellent suppliment,"This is an excellent suppliment, but not enough on its own. It does a good job of cutting through the excessive detail that tends to bog readers of more detailed books down. The sample questions are semi-literate, and at times completely unintelligable. They appear to have been published without having been proof-read, and they capture the flavor of Cisco's exams perfectly."
3,OK but not perfect,"Ruslan's review sums this book up well - you will probably scrape through if you rely on it alone, but for a real understanding of the topics it should be used in conjunction with Jeff Doyle's excellent Routing TCP/IP Vol 1. The main problem with the book is that it has not been properly proof-read and contains many 'dense' areas that are difficult to understand (for example, the explanation of redistribution in networks with redundant paths or the 'DUAL' flowchart in EIGRP)."
5,"Passed ACRC easily, Miracolously with Cisco ACRC Exam Guide","I can't believe it, when i think of it. I passed ACRC with 884 out of 1000 in just less then 1 hour and 1 week of study time. I have lammle's book, it contains errors. So i move to this book, and guess what ? As any other ciscopress book, it's good to read, and unconciously I memorized it.When i took the exam, i though i failed, upon a click of NEXT button, there my 'CONGRATULATION' displayed and the score is quite high too.Believe me use Cisco Press Exam Guide. ..."
3,Not worth the money,"Sadly, like most books from cisco press this book was of little help. Although, I did find the CD to be helpful with other study guides (Exam Cram) I actually read the Exam Cram for ACRC and passed the Cisco practise test that came on the cd rom. I do not like to be critical of cisco, since I'm focusing my career around them, but this book like other cisco press books, and quite frankly like their tests, seem to be more impressed with themselves and how cleaver they are then the material at hand. The three stars are for the cd that came with it. :-)"
2,Huge number of errors,"Some sections are very good, but others are awful. Cisco Press really rushed this one to the market? Do they hire proof readers who have a clue?"
3,Not the help I was looking for,"The book proclaims itself to be the perfect way to help you focus your studies and keep you on the ""right path"". Boy, nothing could be further from the truth, I felt more unfocused than i ever did after going through the book. There is nothing wrong with the actual tech info, but the book doesn't organize the info efficiently, it's a meandering, jumbled mess of info.....Get to the point! Streamline it! Didn't care for the study questions either. I would have given this a 2 star, but the CD of study-questions, even though there are some questionable answers there, was suprisingly good, given that it came with this mess of a book"
2,spend your money elsewhere,I wish I had chosen to spend my time reading something else. The only redeeming elements of this book are the scenarios and the end of chapter quizes.The presentation of the material is frustrating to say the least. The author oscillates between useless fluff (8 pages on classes of IP addresses) and misses important details needed to understand examples (e.g. mentioning commands executed via access lists that aren't shown).Not at all up to the quality I'd come to expect from the Cisco ACRC and ICRC books.
1,Teribble book with too many mistakes.,So many errors and problems I couldn't even read this book. Save your money.
2,Not worth it's price,"The toy it's very small, I have another one that it's twice the size. The mirror is very small, the star doesn't move from its place. I wouldn't recommend this toy, save your money as it's definitely it's overpriced"
4,Create Your Squares,"I slept on and took a break from IDM for like 2 years. I went on Youtube and heard Synthacon 9 live and was transported right back with no complaints. Go Richard! I bought the album for this track and wasn't disappointed. This track is just retarded. It creates visuals in my head like the red sea parting except it is really composed of architectural pillars, or vise versa rather,pillars of water, that have a sea of bodies contorting and swallowing themselves. And then a new wave splashes..and I'm not even trippin'.Ooohh, what does it all mean? Who knows. There is a point though,like on Death F mental beats and maybe towards the end, where I get a little aphexed out. It becomes repetetive(go figure, its electronica),too hard, and hellish masturbatory drills of bleeps and uhh..futhermore makes me want out..NOW. But it balances out with an ambient number at the end. I like R.James the most when he's in ambient mode."
1,Not doing much for me anymore.,"I dunno guys, Im a pretty huge Aphex fan and own most of his cds. At one point I searched every record store looking for anything he had touched, let alone his own work.In the last few years it just seems like he turns on the recorder every time he does any work or gets a new piece of gear. Ive felt this way for a while but then Analord came out and I liked a few tracks there. Mostly though it fell under the definition I gave earlier. SO, when this came out, I bought this and the single. It just doesn't sound like a lot of effort is going into the work and this release really doesn't do much to change my perception.RD James is definitely going back into the try before you buy category for me"
5,great for your bucks,The price is excellent for what you'll get. The sheets are made in China. Package came by UPS. If you are concerned about wrinkles you probably won't want to get them. Buy percale if you want the 'no wrinkle' look. Either that or buy a really nice comforter and no one else will see the wrinkles or you could take the time to iron them. I'm more concerned with comfort and the sheets are very comfortable. I have a high pillow top mattress and the bottom sheet covered it very well. What I liked best about it is that there was elastic on all sides of the bottom sheet. So many manufacturers only have them on two sides. Color was exactly as shown. The stitching on the top sheet and hem of pillow cases were very pretty.
5,Expensive looking,"These sheets have a great looking trim, just what I wanted. Expensive looking without the expense."
5,No pat answers,"This film tackles the complexities of the very human individuals involved in a relationship that threatens to destroy one or both of them. Intense performances by the lead actors Gazzaniga and Conlee, a top supporting cast, terrific pacing and sound design all make this story gripping from start to finish. ""How do these people live?"" one character asks, and the film, rather than giving pat or expected answers, makes us probe the layers of the problems to ask more questions, even of ourselves."
5,the best toning dvd ever!,"i am a big fan of workout dvds, especially for toning. as a mother of three, and wife, it is great to be able squeeze in a workout of this magnitude w/my busy schedule. the moves are great because they are different from all the other workouts, which keeps you from getting bored.thanks minna!!"
3,"Good,balanced video.","Minna's videos are always easy to follow, easy to understand and easy to modify if need be. That said, its a great video if your new to strength training or just getting back into working out. It will not however get you into the shape of the instructor. If your looking for a different dvd so you dont get bored with all the rest, this is your dvd. I did all 4 circuts and was pretty tired afterwards, but I havent worked out in a few months. By far THE MOST EFFECTIVE TAPES are from beach body. Slim in six, ect. This tape will suffice until I'm ready for theSlim in six program."
3,Not sure this workout works for a DVD,"I like that there is a lot of variety and most of the activities are fun. What I don't like is with a lot of the exercises, it is very possible to look like you are doing it right but not actually get any of the benefit (form really matters). I think this workout would be really great if done in a class or with a personal trainer, but on a DVD it doesn't work so well. I have only done it a few times though- I bet if you stick it out and try really hard to follow her, you will get good results."
5,Challenging and Fun,"This is one of the best, balanced, and solid overall workout DVDs that I've bought. At first I thought it was too simple; but as I kept following it for over an hour, I found it actually challenging and I got tired. It includes some interesting plank exercises that are challenging and yet very do-able. I like the music and the instructor is very pleasant. Throughout the program, core is being tightened. I've been regularly exercising for the last 15 years and I always search for fun and effective exercise programs that I can do at the home gym. I bought this DVD based on the reviews and am having so much fun working out with this DVD."
4,Pretty good!,I wasn't sure about the title but it turned out to be a really good workout. The instructor has a very nice personality and she keeps it moving along.
4,Excellent overall routines!,"This is not the first Minna Lessig DVD I've owned. Minna's cueing is precise, explanation and demonstration of each move clear. She knows how to make you feel the challenge of the reps and what each move will do for your body."
3,It's okay.,"While this DVD did give my girl huge guns, worthy of an A-1 Abrams, her belly is by no means a bikini and she continues to wear one pieces in public. As for her bottom, it is definitely short."
1,Boring and Annoying,"Witches are among us. Witches, according to this book, are an alien race called Maulkians who were responsible for the formation of the human race when the first Maulkians got down and kinky with the early primates. For some complicated reason, most of the male Maulkians have killed each other off or otherwise disappeared and one of the most powerful witches (Tamara) decides to make a full male Maulkian out of a human with Maulkian heritage, Jesse. However, a human named David who wants to be Maulkian is jealous. Plots ensue.It's rare that I have *nothing* good to say about a book. But the characters were contrived, the plot logic was more or less non-existant, and there was nothing distinguished about the writing quality.Pass by, gentle reader."
1,Spend the $$ for a better one,"Hard to pull the bag out-have to pull out the whole unit and if your bag is even the slightest bit overfilled it gets caught and tears when pulling out. Unit comes off the track ALL THE TIME. Highly recommend you spend the money for a better unit. I bought this a few months ago and am now ordering aWhitney Design C9517 Sliding 24-Quart White Trash Can with Chrome Frame and Sliders SOURCE: Amazon.com Product Description, hoping for better luck! I only gave this one 1 star because you have to give at least 1 star to enter a rating."
3,"Nice Size, Hard to get a full bag out.",I like the size of the cage but I have yet to pull out a full bag without ripping the plastic. I like how easy it is to slide the basket in and out. I would say that it was a fair deal for what I paid for it but I would probably go for a TRUE canister next time.
2,The most mediocre book on Wicca,This book doesn't really have much to do with being a male Pagan. I bought it anxiously looking forward to a new more masculine perspective on the Craft and found old information simply restated. It was valuable to me for giving information on the modern history of Wicca. Overall it was disappointing.
3,To Templars 357,"I read this book and reviewed it many years ago when residing in northern Nevada, It's a much needed, even requisite piece of text every fist year male student of Wicca shouldn't just study, but embrace. It proves that this is a Woman's Only cult or a faith in which males are castrated for the sake of female superiority. While sustaining the Male in a manner rarely seen in this world, it likewise balances things, bringing the gung-ho feminists down a few pegs, emphasizing that the Goddess -- the Lord and the Lady -- do not play favorites when it comes to gender, gender identity, etc. On the spiritual plane, we are equals when it comes to such things; a bit of both, so let's get over the myths of human arrogance and ""tradition"".Templar357... you offered an AWESOME review. I applaud you, your conviction and honesty. We need more people in our world like you.Bright Blessings!"
1,Misleading...Where's the Male Stuff???,"The book's title leads you to think that the book is geared towards Men. As you read through, you quickly realize that it would be better titled Creation's Covenant's View of Wicca.I'll agree that the book is great for those uninformed about the Craft, and looking for information. Unfortuately, someone looking to break away from the female dominated stereotype of Witches will not find much help here. It rarely seperates the genders and focus' on coven-work, as opposed to something a male solitary would find helpful.I was looking for a book to take to my male friends to help explain what I believe. That would have proven to be a mistake because as I am not part of the author's group, and he doesn't stray from their beliefs very often."
5,Solid book.,"A.J. did a good job writing this book. The book is an insperation to a man to not only get involved better in Wicca, but to treat his female counter part better, and vice-versa. This really sets the equality back into the religion, as it may be hard for men to go into a female dominated religion when we grow up in a male dominated world. It puts equality back to this life. There are some...'interesting'...views in the book about creation. I really enjoyed the book, and reassures the reader there is no one 'right' way. It gives examples for a coven, but reassures one that it can be used for the solitary Wiccan. I think A.J. did a great job on this book and look forward to getting his Spell Craft for Men book soon. Also I recomend heading over to his site neo-pagan.com as it also is a good community. This book will be on my recomendation list, and in my library for a very long time. Thank you A.J for this book."
2,same old book different cover,"The author attempts give much needed attention to the male aspect of the religion. Some good points are made, but too much of the book is ritual, which I did not honestly get much out of. It focuses on the authors own tradition of wicca.Even though this is adaptable to anyone, it also smelled too much like a beginner book,which I did not expect.I already have too many 101 books in my library.I only read it once and donated it. Sorry.."
4,College Student,"Being a student I need to keep track of my time for classes and deadlines. The clock does updtae itself to the current time but I found out the hard way that you have to keep your clock near an area where the radio signal that the clock picks up can be picked up. In other words it doesn't work everywhere, only places where the time signal can be picked up. Other than difficulty with finding a good signal which can be difficult at times the clock is great. You might fumble a little at first when setting up the clock since it's not totally automatic when you first set up it, requiring you to press a button on the back at certain intervals so the clock can be set up correctly."
1,"There are less expensive, less complicated atomic clocks","I bought 3 other atomic clocks (one as a gift), each for $20, and each required a less complicated procedure to set up than this one. So don't think you need to spend a lot to get an atomic clock. The better (or at least less expensive) one I'm referring to was by Lacrosse Technologies, and I bought it at a local store. I also like the way it looks although the materials are probably less expensive than this one. (But the second hand doesn't fall off!)"
1,Disappointing because it failed to pick up a signal,"Although this clock looks great, it failed to pick up a signal and set itself anywhere in my home. I returned it to the manufacturer for repair, but the repaired clock also failed to set itself. Further, it does not automatically set itself when you put the battery in, you have to go through a cumbersome set-up procedure. I would not recommend this clock to anyone who does not live in Ft. Collins, where the time signal originates."
5,A Page Turner Full of Fascinating Characters and Stories,"This lively narrative history is full of fascinating characters and stories. The humbly powerful John D., Jr. (who financed it), the Victorian president of Columbia (who leased the land), Nelson Rockefeller (who took over command of it), and the extraordinary team of builders and architects who designed and built it--they and many others truly come to life. How do you build a vast commercial center in the depths of the Depression? How do you rent out the space? How does it become more than a collection of office buildings and turn in one of the world's great tourist attractions, and a symbol of NYC as the world's modern commercial capital? Okrent tells us with wit, with sympathy and admiration, but without sparing some of the gory details. A great choice for anyone who enjoys reading about business enterprise, architecture and design , the Rockefellers--or about the central character in the tale, the city of New York."
3,If you like historical minutae you'll enjoy this book,"Although a slow read, this book is well worth having in your history collection. It fills in those annoying gaps in your knowledge of the era and could possibly change your mindset on the Rockefellers per se."
3,Tons of information.,"It was a long read for me, just a little to much information in my opionion. Overall a good book, but wasnt as interesting as I was hopeing it would be."
1,good story dreary writing,"The story is good...especially after Chernows book on Rockefeller. But surprisingly, for one who I believe was an editor at Time, this needed editing...serious editing. Gotta agree with the most scathing review."
2,"great buildings, good stories, bad writer","this book is barely enjoyable and only in spite of the truly awful stylings of mr okrent. his conversational overuse of simile forced me to put the book down several times -- beyond tedious. his cutesy language is even more frustrating when coupled unnecessary sesquipedalia. i'd prefer cogently connected chapters any day. further, the images he selected do not enhance the story.most of these complaints have nothing to do with the admittedly complex and large scale of the story. i am a graduate student in a real estate development program in new york. anecdotes about rock center have come up in various classes and i was eager to learn more. while this book does contain salient facts and stories, it is difficult to recommend something so poorly crafted."
5,Good Quality,I skip between this brand and another. This brand is very good with no ingredients that I do not want in my supplements. I have been taking this for several months and I find that I am more relaxed and have more energy.
3,"Good price, impossible to assess quality","This bottle of 60 100mg capsules sells on Amazon for $40, compared to $60 for the same product at my local natural foods supermarket. Is the product the same? Who knows. The bottle looks the same, but quality control in nutritional supplements is extremely lacking so I have no idea if I'm getting better quality, the same quality or worse quality than the bottle I buy at the store. All I can say is that it costs less."
5,A Global Analysis,"With an understanding of globalization and public policy, the author dissects the problem of rural poverty in India and advances bold new ideas on how to improve the situation. Illustrated by his own extraordinary personal experience in south-central India, the author provides lessons which cross national boundaries for those who want to make a difference in the lives of the world's poorest citizens. The problem is deep-seated and the obstacles to improvement are many, but one finds hope in the book through the improvements one committed man has made in the lives of a small portion of India's rural poor."
5,India Untouched,"I just finished reading India Untouched and I must say it is one of the most informative and eye opening books on the India of today. Dr. George provides a revealing view from his own personal accounts on many of country's most pressing issues - everything from illiteracy of the poor, to proper health care for the economically disadvantaged. India Untouched sheds light on the real India and the hundreds of millions that have yet to feel the affects of outsourcing and globalization. This is a must get book for any India-American or anyone that is interested in the topic of social poverty and the different strategies of combating the problem."
4,How to discover a culture,"Far from me to speculate on the quality of the research done by the author in order to write this book. Or to criticize him for stressing some stuff that actually does not seem very important in trying to understand such a great civilization relations with the world. The strength of this book, for me, resides more in its quality of case study on how a culture is seen by people ignorant of that very same culture. Today, in spite of Internet and CNN we can see too many examples of generalizations toward other cultures (all latinos eat hot spicy foods). Mr. Spence gives us a very enjoyable book, apparently well documented, instructive, and that makes us think about what happens today when we look above our fence. A very worthy read."
4,The Spence's pretty good book,"I agree with much of what some of the other reviewers have said. I enjoyed this book. It is built from a series of popular lectures given to an interested university audience. This explains some of its oddities. Indeed, this is not a history of China, nor a heavy scholarly work. It is a sort of literary criticism--mainly examining just what its title says it does: China in Western minds. So be it! It is a nicely done bit of scholarly impressionism. Spence does not hit the reader with a bludgeon; his theses are woven lightly through the text. One must go to other sources for the heavy duty Chinese history. Recommended."
3,Dated,I have been listening and collecting Eno since I was 13. I came across this book online and was excited to get it until I read it. I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I didnt see it here though. Keep in mind this is an older work and not really Brian Eno's work as well. It is one person's interpritaion of another persons creativity. I found the art works dated and not to my taste. I guess I really shouldn't be surprised though. I am sure other people would not understand my interpritaions if I were to creat art inspired by Brian Eno as well. It's all relative.
4,Dance Marker Double Wave,It was very nice product for beginners who just started to learn how to dance-simple and fun. Compare with the price $9.99. I think I had very good choice and very happy with it.
4,Miracle Cure?,"I have read that this product works in helping to reverse Austism and have read many testimonials. After 2 weeks I have seen some definite improvements in my son, so although I can't judge its effectiveness right now, it is certainly helping."
2,Mzungu,"As a frequent traveler to Kenya and Tanzania for nonprofit development work, I was very happy to finally find a book written about Maasai women. While the female gentile mutilation descriptions were truly horrifying and probably accurate, I was disappointed that most of the story took place in upper class Nairobi, Paris and New York, places rarely seen by Maasai women. This novel seems an attempt to to entertain with highly unlikely adventures of the ""rich and famous"" to make the point about the horror of FGM. I wonder how much the author truly knows about Maasai culture. Her bio says she was born in Africa, a very large continent most of which is not Maasai, and now lives in the US. Some of her descriptions do not ring true to me about Maasai customs and sexual practices as explained to me by Maasai friends. I do hope someday a true biography will be written by one of the inspirational women leaders of the Maasai community."
4,cute,As soon as the sun comes up this little toddler is ready for the day! She runs to find her dad and demands that he get up as well. From there it's off to the park with dad! She feels like she is flying when she is swinging high in the swing and when her dady picks her up and spins her around and around!The pictures were fun to look at. The story moved at a fast pace as well.Yes. Little children need to know that their fathers love them very much. This book reinforces the concept well. Playtime with daddy is away fun time in our family and this is a great book to read just before some daddy time!
4,A beach to try to figure out.,"This book is mostly set in America (maybe); it's about dreams (perhaps) and death (somewhat); a girl (who sometimes isn't); a guy (most of the time is unless he's not); you'll understand after you've read it (doubtful).Erickson is always fun to read, if for no other reason than to give your brain a workout. I'm not trying to compare these folks, but if you like Vollman, D. F. Wallace, Pynchon, etc., then you will probably like Erickson. Not liking any of them doesn't preclude you from liking Erickson, though.I'm reading Erickson's books in the order he wrote them, but I let a few months pass in between."
5,A charming Palmer Brown classic,"I discovered Palmer Brown when I was eight years old. Browsing through the library, I fell in love with his charming cover illustrations, and when I got his books home, I fell in love with the warm, cozy world he depicts. This is a sweet, short book, with lovely illustrations by the author, which shows us what Christmas used to be, and still could be if we try. Reading it is a reminder of a gentler time; a reminder that will do us all good. Read aloud, it is a treat for very young children, and their slightly older siblings will enjoy reading it themselves.I also highly recommend Beyond the PawPaw Trees and The Silver Nutmeg by Palmer Brown. These books, for slightly older children, are magic, pure and simple. . . ."
5,Children's books!,Our family loves collecting books and this is a wonderful addition to our growing library! Delightful book and enjoyed by all!
2,a little disappointed,Most of these games can be found on any ESL website for free on the internet. The book contains some great ideas; but I would save the money and just do a google search instead.
1,Gross,These were not what I was expecting. I have had other brands that were very good and these were not. They tasted old!
2,Stale even though the expiration date is more than a year off,"I received two boxes (as ordered) and each had a different expiration date. So far, I've only opened one of them, and chose to start with the older one (closer expiration date). The candy was stale; crusty around the edges. This is clearly the fault of the manufacturing and wrapping process, not the fault of the vendor who sold it to me through Amazon. A disappointing purchase. Good thing it wasn't a gift."
4,dxm,"this is a quality mixer, complete with effects which synchronize very easily, kill buttons for the EQ, and smooth faders. Now only time will tell how much I like it down the road, but from the get-go, it's what I wanted at a great price compared to other mixers with similar features."
2,new?,"I ordered this Linear Algebra textbook. It arrived on time. But, there are some dusts that stuck on the cover page and the corners are bended a little bit."
1,Terrible Solutions Manual,"I bought this book thinking it would help me solve the problems that I didn't know how to do, but it didn't. The solutions manual is nothing more than a copy of the answers that are already in the back of the textbook. The book doesn't even go into more detail about how they got the answer. Don't waste your money on this solutions manual!"
3,Some tracks are OK.,"I happen to enjoy the sound of a lovely female voice. I am an anime fan and really love some Voice Actresses - they are great at what they do. But in this CD there was a lot of talking. Track One is great and I liked Track Three, in which the two people should talk - that's the S&M; track. But the rest of the people just chatted too much during sex.Maybe they were nervous or too aware of the fact they were being recorded. Also the music sometimes just seemed unneeded. When you make a CD about sex, focus on the sounds of sex. That's it. True, these were real couples, not porn stars. But maybe that was the flaw? Maybe you need a few Voice Actresses to have a go at making a sex CD? I don't mind loud sex but people chatting about socks and ex-boyfriends and quoting SNL just takes the mind off track. Why not just watch an adult film?"
1,"Porn Without the Video. How Stupid Can a CD be? If this is Erotic, You Are Desperate!","This is not music, it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background. WTF is wrong with you people for giving this CD a high rating... Seriously, it is DUMB. Seriously folks, if you want to listen to a porn with no video, this is it. There isn't any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music... I cannot believe this CD was so highly rated... Seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review, just unbelievable. You'd have to be a moron to enjoy this."
1,Encounters Erotica CD,This is by far the worst CD ever so retarted I hate it I would suggest not to buy this product or CD orfor consideration think about this product at all for purchase its just a CD of a group of teens it seams like or just crack heads talking dirty but its soo cheesy that its like two people talking while watching TV so much back ground noise and static it sucks bad terrible not erotic at all very poor quality and trashy material totally not worth a penny. THE WORSE ever.
1,Still Wild Lacks West,"If you are searching for a good book about the West, then keep on looking. This book led me to believe that I would read some short stories dealing with the West, but really the only connection to the title of the book is that the stories take place in the West. I didn't overly enjoy any of the stories and as soon as I would start to become involved in one, it would end, leaving me extremely unsatisfied. I practically made myself finish reading this book because I had spent so much money on it."
4,a Good rainy day read,"I thought this book was an ok read and interesting, for me though a lot happen between them by page 50 or 60 but it was still good, great love scenes and everything that you could expect from Connie Mason's writting style..Its good for a rainy day readAlso Recommended: lori foster, kinely macgregor, joise litton, connie mason, judith mcnaught, brenda jackson, sandra brown......."
1,Not a Favourite,"Typically, I enjoy books written by Connie Mason. But not this one. It is just sooooo far fetched and borders on ridiculous. You can find better books by Connie Mason out there."
4,"The Lumax Funnel Leaks, this one doesn't","This is a replacement for the Lumax which is identical to this unit in size. This Plews unit is solid. The Lumax leaked.One possible negative thing I would mention is that the label for the Plews funnel says ""Warning: Handling the brass parts of this product will expose you to lead."" I didn't actually see any brass parts, so I'm not sure what it is talking about.Anyway, it doesn't leak, and that's my main concern. I'll ignore the possiblity of lead poisoning for now."
5,BREATHTAKING MUSIC,"This is an astounding recording!With sound remastered as if it were recorded in the year 2001 instead of in 1956, Chet Baker and various other stellar performers made supremely beautiful music for the Barclay label. The fourteen songs collected on this CD are the best of the best. Written by the likes of the Gershwins, Rodgers & Hart, Dietz & Schwartz and others, this is a gorgeous recording--- very accessible, breathtakingly beautiful music, late night-sounding, sexy stuff with Chet Baker and his pals: jazz performers nonpareil. (including genius-pianist Dick Twardzik who died tragically after the first two recording sessions).Baker's trumpet playing is nothing less than perfect and his one vocal on the final number, ""Everything Happens To Me"" is sweet and sad.The packaging is beautiful: the liner notes are short, but informative and there are several terrific, sepia toned photographs from the Paris sessions and concerts. Highly Recommended."
4,the pinnacle of early Chet,"Chet Baker recorded enough stuff to fill 4 CD's in his Barclay sessions. This was among his best work with a lack of vocals. Chet's trumpet playing was much improved (and his teeth were still intact).This CD is a ""best-of"" culled from those sessions. There is a BIG difference in mood in the CD, The upbeat songs are peppy but the ballads are quite sad even for Chet. After the recording of the first CD's worth of stuff, his piano player Dick Twardzik, one of the best who ever accompanied Chet, died. And this seemed to deepen the melancholy of the ballads (see Alone Together, or Tenderly).But all of this is well worth having. This (or, prehaps, his work with Gerry Mulligan) is Chet at the pinnacle of his early career, before his bad habits over took him.The sound is an improvement over the originals."
3,I don't know why?,"Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't(even it causes blue screen error and sends error report to Microsoft). I don't know why? Maybe I need more time to find it out."
3,Toys too High,"Overall the gym keeps my son entertained; however, when he first started using it, the toys were too high for him to reach. Also they are not removeable. It would be nice to be able to move the toys around for some variety."
4,Sicilian Sisters:women in la famiglia,The book is about tragic losses and revenge. Tension between rivals and how the family continues on through tragedies in the immediate family and the organized family. The heroine keeps the families together with her wisdom and shrewedness.

3,"Good Example of early Suns, Nothing like their later stuff","This cd is a good example of what the original Three Suns sounded like as a trio and it's pretty basic. I personally prefer their later recordings which had excellent fidelity, more intricate and complex arrangements by Charles Albertine, and featured swing guitar master George Barnes. As a glimpse into their origins the disc is interesting but if you want the good stuff get On A Magic Carpet."
2,"Nice wiper, poor installation instructions and design.","These wipers work great once installed. The installation instructions are terrible and very confusing. I accidentally installed one upside down (it wasn't obvious which end was up), and once put in place was nearly impossible to remove. I'm guessing these will have to be the last wiper blades I ever buy for my truck, because I don't see that they will ever come off now that they are installed."
5,SURPRISED!,"I was amazed wheN I saw this CD with the original trio ""Los MAchucambos"". The lady, Julia Cortès from my country, COSTA RICA did her own. The recent cd'S come from other group, and they loose the flavour. Hope we can have soon all those wonderful albums from London records!!!!!!!!"
1,Product damaged,"I ordered what I thought to be a lovely gift for a family member. When they received the item, the pot and cups all had chips in them. They were not packed well and I am still awaiting a refund after two weeks of exchanges with the seller. The product did not arrive as stated and was not packed well. I would not recommend this product."
1,awful packaging,"I recently purchased this item and I was not satisfied. The teapot and the cups look just like the picture but they are very heavy. I don't think it will be good for actual use but maybe for decoration. They didn't carefully packaged the item before they shipped. It wasn't even bubbled wrapped, the box was filled with some newspaper ads. And I received one of the cups chipped off, had to get a replacement for it. I was unhappy with the purchase and I would not recommend this seller at all."
2,Find something else!,"I have a cut-down version of this text for a uni class on human information processing. I really hate this book!!It is really hard to read, over technical and just drones on with key words.The companion website is the singularly worst student/instructor companion website I have ever had the displeasure to use."
2,Not as Great as You Think,This book is not stuctured very well. Recieved the book damaged and I bought it brand new.
2,Left wanting more...,"There's really not a lot of inside information here. The book is basically an account of all public information. The pictures included are nothing personal, no interviews with family or others tied to the case. There is no closure with this book. It was interesting, as I had not followed the case closely, but I was definitely left wanting more. If I had it to do over, I would not buy this book. I actually threw it away when I finished reading."
1,read another book for the case coverage,"Very poor coverage of the murder case, especially the trial which i was interested in. If you are looking to evaluate the evidence yourself, choose another book covering the case because this book gives you very little to look at. The worst thing was that it seemed to end suddenly without getting anywhere. The author also puts alot of irrelevant information of other things simply as filler-half the book simply seems to be on statements of the family. Overall, this is a book you finish with and say 'what a waste of time'."
3,A book with hardly any info! Unsatisfied!,"There is only a small amount of information here. Almost all the information is already public and can be gotten on the internet or on the news. The pictures were not private and included no secret interviews. I followed the case, and I didn't add a lot more to my knowledge about this case after reading this book. It is just cheap and dull."
3,Inside the Laci Peterson Murder,"I enjoyed the book, it was well written, however I knew more information from the newspapers than I learned from the book. The main thing that disappointed me was the almost complete exclusion of the trial phase of this case. No transcripts quoted from, no hindsight perspective from counsel, etc. In fact, the trial was limited to just a few end pages. Also, personally, I would have preferred to see more pictures of Laci (only the one on the cover)than of Scott."
3,"Incomplete and ends abruptly, but a good read otherwise","I can't be quite as harsh as others, because a lot of work and research went into this book, and it's a fast read. I didn't hear as much about this case as others, so a lot of this was new. I think the author handled the family relationships well. But I can't believe where it ends. It's just suddenly stops, as if the author decided not to wait for the conclusion, and just ended it, without explanation. Perhaps an author note would have helped."
2,not even close,"I totally agree with the other ""2 star"" reviews. There were many facts completely left out and even some glaring errors. The author mentions 2 caskets (I believe Mom and babe were buried together.) A gruesome fact perhaps, but the error was glaring and disrespectful to the family. At the very least, the author should have known this. It seemed the whole book was thrown together from a few articles reread from a local newspaper. The fact that when Scott was arrested it is not even mentioned that the police even feared for Amber's safety. A very poor effort. Catherine Crier did a superb and respectful book on this case."
3,Decent Reading,"Purchased this for my wife, she read it completely and said that it was well written, but at times was a bit slow. In all I think that she enjoyed the book."
3,A gifted mother who went missing,A gifted mother named Laci was married to a really charming romantic guy named Scott. They were happily married and than out of now where Laci went missing. Scott claimed he had nothing to do about what happened to Laic. The bad thing was that Laci had a child on the way. She was 7months pregnant. Once the town found out what happened they all jumped in and started a seach for her and the baby. While the town was searching for Laci and the baby Scott didn't really seem to care about his missing wife and soon to be baby. When they had a funeral service Scott was kind of laughing. But the police found a way to take Scott in. It was a good and addicting book to read.
4,Thanks To The 8 reviews,"I was looking for a challenging football game to play on the go. It was between Tecmo Kickoff, Madden 08, & 09. I heard that tecmo was fun, just not challenging enough. I saw that this game got a average of 4.5 stars out of 8 reviews, so I gave it a shot. It was much cheaper than '09 also. The passing and running games are done pretty well to my surprise. I like the defensive playmaker choices to help you give the offense a tough time. The cpu AI is pretty good. If a teams overall ranking is better than yours, you have to play an excellent 4 quarters of football to have any chance. Don't expect this to compete with the console games. This game is just what I needed for my football jones on the go!"
5,HIGHEST HEIGHTS,"JACK RUBY PRODUCED STELLAR ROOTS MUSIC FROM THE MID-SEVENTIES. THIS CD IS NON-STOP, CLASSIC AFTER CLASSIC WITH SOME RELATIVE UNKNOWNS COMING TO THE FRONT WITH DEEP, DEEP ROOTS. FOR ME THE STANDOUTS ARE THE INSTRUMENTALS, ESPECIALLY THE MONSTEROUS REWORKING OF ""ROCKFORT ROCK"" CLOCKING AT OVER 8 MINUTES. THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY REGGAE REISSUES IN THE PAST TEN YEARS AND THIS ONE IS IN MY TOP TEN EASILY. THE DUB COMPANION SET IS WORTHY ALSO, BUT NO WHERE NEAR AS ESSENTIAL AS THIS RELEASE."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"I purchased the book years ago because I met the man and was intrigued. Frankly, the book changed my life. I guarantee you that there is no propaganda or veiled messages here. General Risner is a hero worthy of your respect - read his book and let the strength he found in love of God and country speak to you. You'll be glad you did."
5,Replacement Belts for Rototiller,"I've used Dayco V-belts with great success in truck repair and on my own cars for many years. They resist stretching and/or failure in heavy-duty truck usage better all but one other brand. When I needed a pair of spare belts for my rototiller, I found these. Unlike the photo, which is of Dayco's typical ""topcog"" style belt, these belts are of an ""industrial"" style -- that is, they are fully wrapped with fabric. This is of the style of the OEM belts on the tiller. These fit just as they are supposed to and propel the tiller properly. I don't know about longevity but expect them to perform well."
3,Good but slow moving,this was well done but too much explanation at the beginning of each exercise. Once thru I got impatient waiting for her to explain.The Exercises are helpfull though.
5,Children and Adults alike!,I too enjoyed reading this book. I have three girls and would read this book at night before they retired to bed. We all had some wonderful dreams. This book is for the whole family.We are looking forward to the next book by these magnificent authors!
5,Excellent! Watch out Harry Potter!,"I found this book to be intriguing and very entertaining. The story line progresses from realistic to fantasy, which encourages the young reader to continue turning those pages. The authors have a flare with details that creates a visual of the event. I could almost taste the food!"
4,Needs a new editor or spell checker!,"I read this on recommendation from a Harry Potter fan, trying to read something else while I anxiously wait for the next one. I thought the story was pretty good, not good or great, and though I tired of reading it once or twice, I was generally swept through the story.The only gripe I have is that there are obvious misspellings and incorrect words used, which distracted from the story as I had to figure out what should have been used and how it was intended to be read.Overall a good read, but the author needs to get a new editor!"
1,So bad it's not even good,"Like Ryoo Jong Kwon ""jongr"", I think this book is overrated. In fact, I very much suspect that the reviews here are not by real customers, but by friends of the authors.The plot is trite and predictable, the characters one dimensional and unbelievable and the story is short and quite underdeveloped.Do not waste your time or money on this book if you are over the age of six as it will just insult your intelligence."
2,Cheap construction,"I had this chair for about a month before the seat broke when I sat on it (I'm not an overly big guy or anything...6"" 180lbs). The part you sit on is made of cheap particle board with two large holes cut in it which, at least in my case, compromise the structural integrity of the chair. I bought a new piece of wood, cut it to size and recovered. The rest of the chair seems to be built solid. The design of the chair is great and it is very useful, but I'd probably look for something built a little more solid next time."
3,Missed Those Holes!,"This is my second Valet Chair in a one year period. My first chair was not purchased from Amazon.com and the drawer construction was different (seat flipped-up). That construction weakened the chair by rocking back & forth. Over the year, the chair came a part. However, this chair has a drawer under the seat that works wonderfully. The frustration came in matching-up the key holes and bolts/nuts to secure the structure. As a nice father-son project, out came the power drill to ""persuade"" the bolts/nuts into place. A good dose of carpenter's glue in all those holes didn't hurt; along with some well-placed clamps for about 60-minutes! The wood material is of very good quality; the staining is also of good quality. The results are a rock-solid, good looking Valet Chair. Father and son are still talking to one another!"
5,EXCELLENT,"There are so many questions that we all have as to why we are the way we are. A lot stems back to childhood. Some of these issues that adults deal with are sometimes so deep rooted that some do not know where to begin. This book really takes you back to different stages in your life, memories that may still have a strong impact as to why you do and don't do certain things. Ailments that started...certain odors that are bothersome... certain rooms in a home that just don't feel right. Whatever that it is...you just MAY find some answers in this book or at least start a journey of healing. It is only with the Lord's timing that someone will be healed of past circumstances. If you are prepared to go deeper and are willing to let Him reveal things of the past, this book will be a tremendous help, even if it is for someone that you love. Mine has been continually circulating."
5,This book changed my life,"If you are tired of using your anger to control and distance people, if you are in your 30's and are ready to change, this book will help you realize what the root of your problems are and how to be changed. Unfortunately, it is out of print. Let's get someone to reprint this great book."
2,Nothing Creative,The book placed vintage items in houses vs. looking at vintage items and creating new functional things with them. I was looking more for ideas for projects. This book did not spark anything creative in me. I can purchase vintage items and place in my home just like they did. This book was just a bunch of pictures...things that anyone can do.
3,Needed fleshing out of story but otherwise good,"Okay,the farm boys depicted only in weird visions had a falling out? It wasn't clear, since the father was the meaner one, not the older brother, who did not deserve the fate inflicted on him by the younger one.Then, in the present day, the avenging spirit is somehow still around and seeking vengeance on anyone, in this case a group of hapless travelers. How does one of them manage to see the visions mentioned earlier? We will never know.Aside from that, this is creepily shot in an Iowa cornfield, and the makeup and effects are quite good, along with the acting."
4,"Not as good, as i expected.","So far, I havent seen an After Dark Original, That i have truly loved. I Think they should have stuck With After Dark horrorfest, 8 Films To Die For. In those, i found one of my favorite movies of all time. ( The Final) But, this was a good movie, but I Didn't love it. This may sound stupid, but I think that the After Dark Originals, Are trying to be something, there not. They are B Movies, and i feel as if the producers, are trying to make it like a High budget, horror Flick, and it just doesn't work. The Acting was really good, and had some decent Gore Scenes, and special affects. and had a pretty good story plot. But, it kind of reminded me of children Of the corn, in a way. I Don't regret watching this movie, and i am going to add it to my collection, and more than likely watch it again, but it is not one of my favorites. But, check it out!"
2,"Nothing new, meh","This year's edition of the After Dark Horrorfest, retitled After Dark Originals, so far offers nothing we haven't seen before. Case in point with Husk, a tale about five young friends who break down in farm country and wind up becoming fodder for a murderous zombie scarecrow. Yes, you read that right. Husk offers a few scares and some decent gore effects, but the end result is pretty lacking to say it lightly thanks to a clueless, predictable script. Still, it's well filmed and the ending packs a little bit of punch, so you could do far, far worse in terms of disposable horror flicks to check out on a lazy day."
2,Not The Best Killer Scarecrow Movie,"Yeah, I know that Husk doesn't come out on DVD for another month, but I watched tonight on the SyFy Channel, so I'm reviewing it now. Husk is a killer scarecrow movie that is derivative of other killer scarecrow movies. It's also derivative of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in that a group of friends get stranded and go searching for help. What they find is a creepy house with a dark secret. If you've seen a ton of horror movies like I have, then you've seen this plot, or some version of it, play out many times. Husk is rarely exciting and is often boring. The only time it's even remotely entertaining is when a scarecrow is onscreen and that isn't as often as you'd think. Can anyone make a fun horror movie any more? And how could I possibly like a movie that has one character playing chess during a crisis. And the ending is rushed. Oh, for that I guess I should be grateful."
3,Adequate overview of politician's life,"This book, which incorporates autobiographical writings, provides a good overview of the life of Walter M. Pierce, a governor of Oregon and Congressman from that same state. Because of the use of the autobiographical writings, there is extremely detailed information about some aspects of Pierce's life that otherwise likely wouldn't have been covered, such as some of the close votes of his early political life. Unfortunately, the author is unable to explain why Pierce moved to Oregon in the first place or why a progressive like Pierce was also such a racist. Still, this is a good overview of the life of an important political figure in Oregon history and provides insight into life in Oregon in the early 20th century. There is also detailed information about the rise of the KKK in the state."
3,"Not Bing's best, but still okay...","Kind of a snoozy, disjointed comedy in which Bing Crosby plays a 1930s rodeo rider who ropes a society gal, and settles down in the wild West. Crosby's young and cute, but the film's plot is entirely deficient, and almost seems to have been made up on the fly. Look quick for a young Roy Rogers playing in the background during the big hoedown at the end; Martha Raye also debuts here as her typical man-hungry old maid. (Animal acting notes: check out the expression of the white horse Bing rides during a music number at the start -- hilarious! The bull he buys, named Cuddles, is kinda cute too.)"
4,Good Dell substitute,"When the battery died for my Dell Inspiron 6000 I was shocked at the cost of their available replacements - especially considering they all have negative reviews.I found this Lenmar battery and thought I would give it a try - so far so good. After a full charge the battery has consistently provided 2-3 hours of power. I have only had the battery a couple of months so it may be too early to tell...but so far there has been no noticeable decline in performance.Other observations so far: 1. When charging, the battery gets noticeably hotter than the previous Dell version. 2. The onscreen battery monitor does not appear to be accurate for this model, it will show plenty of remaining time and then suddently drop to a few minutes remaining without warning.On the evidence so far this has performed better than the Dell alternative and for half the price!"
3,"Worked for 3 Years, but there are better choices","This battery held up for 3 years (light use), which is good. But higher capacity 9-cell batteries are now available for under $30, such asMaximal Power LB 7200 mAh Replacement Battery for Dell.PROs:* Held up for 3 years (light use)* Identifiable brand - reviews mean somethingCONs:* Expensive* Only 4800 mAh (Mine was 5200 mAh)"
1,Lasted for just two and a half months,"Was sent Dell battery rather than Lenmar and fitted perfectly. However, after two and a half months, the battery was dead and wouldn't hold any charge at all."
4,Lenmar Dell Inspiron 6000 battery,"Buying this battery is a much better option than paying Dell over twice as much for a new one, but be aware that it will not last as long as a brand new battery would. I get close to two hours of battery life with it, and I expect to be able to use the battery for roughly 1 1/2 years before it will no longer hold a charge. Since my laptop is already close to four years old and I intend to buy a new laptop in the next year, this battery was perfect for me, but buying a new battery from Dell might be a better option for those who intend to use their laptops another three years and are looking for more than two hours of battery life. However, I find it so outrageous that Dell charges so much for new batteries that I would just buy another one of these batteries if I did intend to use my laptop more than another year."
3,Just a battery,"I've had this replacement battery for a couple of weeks now, fully discharged it more than once, and am getting about 1.5 hours of operating time. Not great, but better than the ""dead"" battery I just replaced! Now, let's see how long this one lasts (the 1st replacement I purchased lasted about 18 months)."
1,Dissapointed,"After Dell's battery lasted only three years I had assumed that replacing it would be an easy task. It was, however, it wasn't cheap. In doing research I came across the Lenmar battery for my laptop and was excited about the extremely low price. It has been one year since I've owned the battery and now it is completely dead and cannot hold a charge for longer than 30 minutes. If you are okay with replacing this battery very often, go ahead but, if you want a great quality product I would stay away from this Lenmar. There is nothing worse than buying a product to have it last less than a year."
2,Poor long term life,This batter fits well in a Dell 6000 and I have had no problems with it when I first bought it. The batter had about 2.5 hour run time at first. It worked well for a few months. But now about 6 months later it has a 5 minute life which was very dissapointing since the Dell OEM battery lasted almost 2.5 years. The computer is used allot with at least 1 to 2 charge cycles a day. For about $60 this Lenmar battery you might get 6 - 12 months of use. For a Dell OEM you will see around 2 to 3 years of use. For the money buy OEM unless you need a cheap short term solution.
2,"Worked great at first, but now??","My expectation for batteries is pretty low since my last one refused to hold a charge AT ALL and I had to always keep the laptop plugged in. This one came quickly, was marked ""Sony"" on the back (not sure if they all are) and it has worked like a charm.Update as of Nov 30, 2009:The battery now won't hold a charge past 3%, so it's operating via the power plug only. Bummer! Contacted customer service but never got a response."
4,Intimate worship!,This is a great CD to play during quiet times in the prayer closet! The songs are GORGEOUS!
1,Shrank first time washed,"I washed the shirt when I received it in cold water, dried it on low. Shirt shrank at least two inches on the sleeves and across the shoulders."
4,Great quality shirt but they run a bit big!!,"The look of the shirt is great, the quality 5 stars too BUT i order a Medium size and it is a bit bigger than i though . Keep that in mind. Maybe a Small size if you are not overweight fits you better."
5,Great shirt soft yet tough,This is a wonderful shirt. Soft yet tough canvas fabric makes it an instant favorite. I am gathering each different color together in the closet.
4,great looking,this is a great looking shirt. it fits well and is great for outdoor work. i used it out on an off-roading trail to keep the hot arizona sun off my skin; worked great and was relatively cool.
4,Carhartt Sandstone Shirt,"This is a good shirt, but beware of the size charts. I followed them and ended up with a shirt that's the perfect length, but way too loose-fitting. I wear XL shirts in general, but I probably could have gotten a large tall and had it fit better. This thing's pockets end at my armpits...but I still wear it."
1,Defective shirt provided by this supplier,This supplier shipped what appeared to be a second quality shirt. Shirt had various sizedholes. The material appeared to have been damaged during manufacturing process.
1,Not practical for all applications,"I bought this recorder for heavy field use in journalism. My first problem was the voice activated recording. If you turn it off, then the recording is muddy.Second the motor is not very strong. Almost all the tapes I used - that work correctly in other machines - would lock up the motor.I was very disappointed in the motor that couldn't pull a rewind on a 90-minute cassette.Beware of this recorder!!"
1,Useless,"As soon as I finish transcribing what I can from the 90% inaudible mumbles I recorded with my Sony TC-M20DV cassette recorder, I am looking forward to smashing this useless piece of junk with a large hammer. I will never buy economy recording equipment again, because you get what you pay for."
1,Disappointing,I did not like this book at all. It is reminds me of an infomercial. The back and forth manner between the three main characters gets old very quickly.I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,for anyone and everyone,"This text is a complete eye-opener! In my SPED coursework, no other text comes anywhere close to Stowe as far as clearing up my understanding of learning ""dis"" abilities and how we all have a prejudiced view of what a brain is ""supposed"" to act like. Excellent resource!"
5,Dyslexia,"A very informative book which has assisted me in many ways to understand the total issue. I would like to recommend this to everyone who shares this ""problem"""
2,Don't bother,"I teach reading to high school students with a wide range of disabilities, including dyslexia. The title is misleading -- there is very little new information for middle through high school teachers. If you teach first through fourth grades, and don't have much experience with reading disabilities, you might find some good advice, otherwise, don't bother."
2,Why 3-D??,"There is absolutely nothing in this movie that needs to be in 3-D. This is another case of jacking up the price on a movie by slapping 3-D on the cover. I don't think this is the worst movie I've ever seen, but the acting was really bad. Maybe if the writers had given the actors something better to work with.... There isn't enough camp to make this campy, not enough horror to make this a horror film, and nothing funny to make this a comedy. I'm sorry that I have to give it such a crappy review because my daughter is in it, and I wish it had been better."
2,Not Everybody's Cup Of Tea,"13 Stories, 13 Epitaphs is the second book by William Vollmann that I've read and I still am not quite sure what to make of him. The first was Butterfly Stories, a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in Thailand chasing hookers, looking for the one with a heart of gold. 13 Stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless, jobless, and addicted drugs, as well as several whores. It's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about, which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society. It makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable, I can't relate with the characters and don't find much redeeming about his stories, it doesn't seems like he has an overall plan, it's not necessarily a morality tale. I think I've had enough of his novels."
1,one size fits all,"not true....it was too wide for my watch.......................twelve more words, why, I said all i needed to say...one two three"
3,Personal Choice,"Even though I got this strap for $4.99, it was too boring for me. If you want a plain strap you're in luck. Returned it and paid more money for a style I liked."
5,house o holics volume II,"slammin house beats, the way house should be! house o holics light it up again with the best in house music!"
2,Why?,"No, I really don't think too many Le Tigre fans will be into this whole record. Some of these remixes are just horribly standard clubby techno versions of their respective songs (""Tres Bien"", ""Deceptecon""). There are a couple of standouts, like the new spin on ""Much Finer"", or the reworked ""Dyke March 2001"". But the rest of these remixes, each by different djs, are danceable but don't really seem to warrent actually getting released by Mr. Lady."
3,Good selection - very similar,"The paisley patterns are well chosen, but I was hoping to see some other interesting textile patterns as well - most of the other patterns included were very boring and not as representative of the broad spectrum of textile patterns found in Indian fabrics..."
3,good but incompleate,the book has many ideas for design but should've had also ideas for colors and more aplications.
5,"Versatile, durable, attractive case","I've been using this case for probably more than a year now, and it looks as good today as when I first bought it. The construction is solid, and the fabric is stretchy, enabling you to really fill up the outside pocket with stuff. Love the padded shoulder strap, too, and the fact that the handles don't flop down. Be forewarned, though: if you are using this for a laptop that is thicker than a MacBook Pro, you might have some squeezing to do. It will still work just fine, however. I would absolutely buy it again."
2,Poor Handles/Poor Service,"Had this case for less than 1 yr and the handles inside the neoprene covering ripped apart. Called Marware, they wouldn't stand behind their product. So my wife took the handles apart, the nylon webbing that is used is pitiful-no wonder it tore. She replaced it with heavier nylon and handstitched everything back. Now it is sturdy enough to handle the weight of the 17"" for a long time. The rest of the case is good otherwise. But guaranteed that the handle material inside will not stand up - when that happens, expect your neoprene handles to stretch double in length."
2,"This case stinks, literally!","If you don't mind the smell of burning rubber, then this neoprene case might be for you. It they made it out of some other material, it would've been fine. I wound up returning it and got hit with a restocking fee. Decent case otherwise, except I was also looking for a case from which I could access my MacBook Pro without removing it from the case. Finally found what I was looking for in the Vyper by Booq. Just unzip, open one side and start typing away.Pete"
4,New Edition of The Bibleman Adventure,"This edition of the Bibleman Adventure differs from the original cut in that the villain's ""gratuitous dance number"" is new. The scene is all the same, but the soundtrack is different. Also, there's newer background music for the fight scenes in the studio--it's a little more ""exciting"". Other than that, there are no changes to the story."
2,It's like trying to paint the Sistine Chapel with a set of 8 Crayolas and a step-stool.,"I'd love to give this a 5 star rating. I adore the work of Thomas Kinkade, but this is just not good.I can't imagine what I thought I was going to get for just a few dollars, but I thought it had to be better than this. What was I thinking? More importantly, what were THEY thinking??Pardon my error in judgement. Don't make my mistake. Too few colors, cheap paper -- I am very, very disappointed."
4,why isn't larry credited?,One of Sac's hall of fame hustlas ownes a record label and this joint should of blown up..... but again it's the marketing.... Hoodfella's gives it up for all from highlands to the heights...and for all purposes... larry is northern cali's nate dogg.... good for the all nite drive down the way way...
5,came fast was what I wanted in great condition-new,"No problems came right away, in Brand New condition.The movie starring Hope Davis is won of her best works, I loved it, It was an earlier Serendipity..."
3,"So, so","Even though many of the right ingredients are here, this soup ends up a bit thin. The two leads turn in fine performances and there is lots of clever, insightful writing. There is, however, a large lemon on the set souring this film-and that is its tiresome guys-are-jerks stereotypes. In dating hell, to be sure, there is no shortage of horned, pitchforked women. Next time, Brad, chill the male-bashing and spread the flaws a little more evenly."
5,"Hilarious view of dating in the ""real world""","So many times, dating is portrayed on film as wonderful all the time, with the main character finding his or her soul mate--and then the film is usually about their struggles together. In this film, the ""truth of the matter"" comes out--dating is hard, and finding the right person is even harder! Hope Davis plays a great single woman who's not 22 and perfect looking. If for no other reason, rent this video to see the blind dates she ends up on. Hilarious!"
5,What a darling little flick!,"These 5 stars are coming from someone who shys away for the sappy and typically goes for the hardcore action/drama genre. I was completely surprised at how much I loved this little movie! Hope Davis was wonderful- truly and believably shocked at every turn by the actions of the bumbling men she comes across. I found myself laughing out loud and completely enjoying not only the plot, the characters, and the scenery, but the soundtrack as well. Great pick!"
2,"Great, except for the writing","This film meanders all over the place and not charmingly, IMHO. The cast is great and Hope Davis in the lead is interesting enough to carry the movie, but even she didn't overcome the lack of script. It was painful to watch."
5,A Keeper,"One of the greatest 'indie' films by far. Hope Davis needs to get up there to A list because she is among the finest actresses around these days. She blows away Julia Roberts/Michelle Pfeiffer, etc. This woman is talented. The writers/producers of this movie are also geniuses. I look forward to many more of their films."
2,This indie picture's cynicism was disappointing & unromantic,"Although the acting was good I felt that the actors mumbled. It had a cynical approach, I felt, and honestly I thought there was no chemistry between the fated future lovers. The best thing about the movie was the soundtrack, which I bought."
3,VELOUR MAT,"Mat was ok, but had some abrupt cut offs. Will need to some cutting so i can see turn signals - hope it will work."
4,The Early Days of Joe Cocker,"This classic album - and early biography - is a genuine tribute to a remarkable performer. Not only does it contain seven superb songs (recorded live on stage) from the days when he was first known as 'Vance Arnold and the Avengers;' but it also confirms a fascinating account of his early life, playing the clubs and pubs of Sheffield, England, whilst struggling to establish a reputation as a 'new wave' rock and roll singer. The nostalgic album helps re-create part of the atmosphere from that unique period in the mid sixties and provides clear evidence of Joe's raw potential as one of the top talents for the future."
3,this album by Capt. Cook,"I like several of these songs. The slower songs are better because they play everything slow. There is disregard for the proper tempo of the songs. Some songs need to change tempo and they don't do that.The instruments make a pretty sound. However, I wanted this album for dance music. I had one only one dance I could do for the entire album. So, it was sort of boring.If they spruced up the tempo, and varied the tempo, then this would have been a fine album.I think they are used to just being background music."
3,Between the Sheets,"The series looks at several couples at different points in their relationships. An older couple (married over 25 years), a couple together/not married for less than 10, and a couple still dating. They are connected via family ties or through a sex therapist (but she is one of the couples too). The topics are sexual in nature and deal with miscommunication in the bedroom and out of it, infidelity, and forgiveness. It was suprising to see British actors you generally see in period/costume dramas in their PJs or nothing at all. The series is over 7 years old, but I don't think it is too dated relative to the clothes, cars, and settings. I thought it gave some insight into sex therapy."
3,Between The Sheets,"Sadly, the product was defective. The second disc would not play. I have returned it and to this date have not received acknowledgement that the product has been returned. I am hoping for a satisfactory settlement in this matter."
2,Not What I Thought....,"....they are extremely hard to install properly [lining them up], and they break real easy after a few weeks of use. We decided to try the magnetic catches, and are very pleased with how easy they were to install and how well they work. However, if you go magnetic, buy the heavy duty ones."
2,Starter Book,Only buy this book if you know very little in regards to controls and control systems. It won't help you wire a control box if that is what you are looking for.
3,Not for the very young,"I purchased this for my niece who really liked the Disney movie. This book is a bit different than the Disney film, does not contain many pictures, and was not really appropriate for her, age 2. It's a nice story but given the large amount of text this is better for older readers.Alternatively, there is a Small One book based on the Disney film that is more for the younger set.sincerely,R.C."
5,great,the book came in quick and is in excellent condition. the textbook has a lot of interesting problems and examples too.
1,Hated this book,"I have been doing calculus for a very long time and I am appalled by the ugly approach to mathematics by these two authors. Math is so beautiful because it is not phoney and the outcome is useful, exciting, tangible, palpable. But not here. The authors simply love wasting time and energy with useless stuff like proving limits that are instinctively so obvious. What next, prove that 1+1=2? You might get sick of math reading this book, but it's not maths fault, really."
4,A good picture of revolutionary Ireland,An informative humanizing biography that provides a good picture of revolutionary Ireland. More photogrpahs would have made for 5 stars.
2,Writer gets in the way,"This book is written by an adamant supporter of its subject. According to the author, everything Mr. Collins did had a magic to it. I had great difficulty relating to the subject as a fellow human being who made a lasting impression on the face of Modern Ireland. Because the writer was so passionate about Michael Collins, it was impossible for me to get a good picture of him as a man. So I was unable to read more than 40 pages of the book. I think his was an incredible life which took place at a critical time in Ireland's history. But rather than being historical or biographical, this reads more like an endorsement of the greatness of Michael Collins. It doesn't present the facts and then let the reader come to conclusions. It is well informed, and might make a good companion to a biography, but doesn't stand alone as an objective piece of writing."
2,Slow Moving Writing Plagues Michael Collins Again!,"Anyone who knows the story of Michael Collins and who has seen the movie or read this book knows that people have a hard time showing what is truely a fascinating story. A slow-paced storyline and the tendency to over-examined inconsequential facts while under-examing crucial events(like his meeting with Churchill and his cronies) leaves the reading saying, ""So What"". Too bad becuase it is one hell of a story. PS- The movie was dreadfully boring."
5,thoroughly researched and easily approachable,"Coogan sets forth an amazingly intricate and thorough history of Collins, one of the greatest Irishmen of the twentieth century. His unblinking portrayal of Collins begins with his childhood in Clonakilty and takes the reader detailed step by detailed step to his death in Beal na mBlath and beyond. Coogan shows his background as a journalist, as his history is approachable and easily readable. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in Twentieth Century Irish history."
3,CHEAP and JUNKIE but works fine.,"First time I hooked up my new CAT5e cable the outer shield pulled loose from the conneter on one end.I was and always am very careful when connecting computer,audio,and video cables.BUT ON A POSITIVE NOTE,the CAT5e cable does a perfect job of transmiting the internet to every computer I have used it on.After all it only cost $1.89 for 50ft."
1,Broken on delievery,Broken on delivery. The 3 and 6 pin did not work. I had to recap it myself and now it seems to be ok.
1,dont buy this item bc its cheap its not worth it at all,this itam is garbage plz dont buy bc its cheap u will regrat when u get this itam batter buy little expencive then this cheap garbage
1,Cheap Price means Broken Product,I got this cable in the mail with a broken end. I emailed them about the problem and still a week later almost no reply. Would not buy again or recamend them.
2,Poor quality jacket,"You get exactly what you pay for, maybe even less. The jacket is very thin and easily pulled away from the ""reinforced"" plug ends, exposing bare wires. The cable does work, but I expect it will need to be replaced in a short period of time. I would return it, but the cost to return is more than the cost of the item."
5,Perfectly good cat5 cable,Works as expected and much cheaper than ones found in local stores. Used to connect a Mac Mini to a Cisco network switch where the jack was part way around the room and I needed to hide the cable somewhat on top of a white conduit. No problems at all but only running 10Mbit Ethernet so that shouldn't tax it very much.
4,It's a cable.,"Not too much to say about this. It's a CAT5 cable, it's 50 feet long, and it works. It allowed me to hide my home server away out of site. It is a rather flimsy cable though, definitely no shielding in it, which I knew ahead of time."
1,Does not work well at all. Stay away...cheaply made.,"This cable was a waste of money. I spend a lot of hours trying to figure out what the problem was with my connection. It would work one time and then not work another. I thought it was my internet. I switched out cables and found this to be the problem. The more I learned the more I realized that this cable has no insulation and is not twisted. I suggest that you don't cheap yourself on this like I did. Check monoprice.com for decent cheap cable (go with cat6). (no, I am not an affiliate)."
1,Works but not sure its E,It works but there is no label on the cable to show me it is 5E and not cheap 5 but anyway i purchase 6E now for gaming
1,My internet is much slower now.,"I'm not a real techie so I'm not sure what the problem is, but I replaced my regular cable with this one and after using it for a couple of weeks, I've noticed that my internet connection runs so much slower now. Sometimes it stalls, or runs like dial up for a couple of minutes and then goes back to a faster connection, but not nearly as fast as the shorter cord I had. Also, when I have multiple web tabs open it stalls ALOT when before it barely stalled at all. I haven't changed any other settings on my pc. Just unplugged the old, and plugged in this new one. I'm using an Acer netbook and Linksys modem/router.I threw the other one away and now I'm not sure which one is like the one I had before that came with the modem. This sucks big time."
1,Bargincell is not a bargin,"Bought this product from Bargincell. Was very disappointed. This was our 1st purchase from Amazon when so many people have been telling us to order from Amazon for various products. Was very cautious and now I see why. The ethernet cable we ordered was sub standard. We had to play with it, jiggle it several times to eventually get it to work. It is smaller than a regular sized ethernet. If someone is selling a product please sell legitimately so people will feel comfortable using you again. Their credibilty is shot b/c I know they knew what and why they were selling that irregular cable. We agreeed it was not worth the hassle to return the cable."
1,"Piece of waste, unreliable, not recommended.","I bought this cable from Blue Mall. It is very unreliable. I used this to connect my mac mini with cable modem and it did not work no matter what i did. I then used it to connect my printer, it worked. Now, when I used it to connect a router to cable modem, it worked for couple of days and later stopped working. Not sure what's wrong with this. I absolutely do not recommend this item."
4,Its just a cable why pay more?,"I bought this cable because I needed the length and I didn't feel like paying a fortune for what is essentially a long piece of wire. The price was cheap. Shipping was about business 5 days faster then what was estimated. It works just as expected. I gave it four stars instead of five because the cable does feel thin and not as rugged as some of the other ones I have. But I am using them to run a network not swing across a ravine, so I think I'll be fine."
5,Works Great. Great Price.,I ordered this to hook up a PS3 in the other room. Works flawlessly. Good Quality. I would reccomend this cable to anyone.
4,Does it's job well.,"Well, there really isn't much to say about the cord. It works. However, I put it underneath my carpet, and when I took it out from under it to rearrange the location of my router, I found that the cord had been split open. It still works, but the casing on it is broke. Fair warning. Four out of five, just because the casing is split open."
1,It works... for those who don't need a CAT5/CAT5e cable in the first place.,"This is not a CAT5e cable. This isn't even a CAT5 cable. 1 star for lying to me.The standard for CAT5 and beyond all require twisted pair wiring inside the cable, with a different number of twists per distance for each pair. This improves the signal quality of the cable and allows for high speed data transfers. But there are absolutely no twists in this cable's wires! I have uploaded a picture of the cable to demonstrate that fact. I am unable to get any computer to connect at gigabit speeds through this cable - they all fall back to the painfully slow 100mbit/s. But 100mbit/s is plenty compared to internet speeds. So those of you just using this cable for internet access, you're fine. Everyone else, avoid this cable! I'd have complained back to the seller for selling me a sub-standard cable and falsely labeling their product, but for the price I'm not going to bother. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
2,Poor quality,"The plastic in the connectors is very cheap and flimsy. First the connectors would occasionally fall out of the ports, then eventually they stopped being able to lock into a port at all after just a few months, and finally the plastic lever on the connector completely snapped off. All of this was despite barely having touched the cable since first plugging it in. The cable did function fine for the short time it stayed reliably connected.Yes the price is very low, but I'd recommend spending just a few dollars more to get a cable that will last."
5,Exactly as described & Citi ships SUPER fast,"Tonight was my first night using the Ethernet cable, so I can't really give a 100% honest assessment of how the cable is, but from tonight, it worked just fine. It was 50 foot as described, and I hooked it up from my bedroom's router, to my blu-ray player, which is located in the living room. Had no connection issues and my ""BD-Live"" with Netflix, Youtube, etc. worked like a charm!Most importantly, the shipping speed of Citi was the fastest I have ever received an item, even faster than from Amazon.com themselves! I ordered the cable on Friday, and it arrived Monday. I am in Jersey and they shipped from California, yet I still received it two days later. I highly recommend ordering from them."
2,"Works for now, but flimsy","It's been working fine as far as internet connectivity goes, but the connector keeps slipping out - I use it with a laptop and it's just not sturdy enough to be plugged into and removed from a laptop a couple of times a day. Even though I don't move the computer with it plugged in if I can help it, the connector starts to come out on a regular basis and I have to shove the cable back into the connector. Once it finally slips out all the way, this cable will be done for unless I can splice another end on myself. I've had the cable for a couple of months now, but I think it started doing this within the first two weeks. And I suspect that even if you use it with a desktop, you will begin to have this problem if you occasionally need to shift your CPU slightly to access all the cables in the back."
1,peter035,"Not a first person shooter, deceptive artwork on case to make you think it is. Strategy game, found it boring.I like strategy games.Cheesy graphics.Soldiers or ""units"" are symbols not charecters.Terrain is simplistic.Game of the year? What a joke."
2,Company of Zeros The Shame of The Year.,This Game does not diserve game of the year. Plus don't believe these other reviews. I am so tired of game develpers writing reviews for there own game. You are being betrayed. Relic is paying off to there horrible games to have game of the year. They all should be Shame of the Year because they ar BOOOOOOORING.Factions: Only 2 boring factions that have a lack of units. Plus They both look exactly the same.Insane Profanity: They always say the F word and it is so annoying. They will just not stop swearing.Zoom Feature: Sure there is a Zoom Feature. Which is the ONLY Reason why this game got game of the year. Because they have a pretty little zooming feature which you rarly use and is distracting in battle. That is why Dawn of war and Homeworld got game of the year.I liked the covering feaure but this game just isn't fun or creative. I would go with Command and Conquer 3 if you Want FUN and CREATIVITY!
1,RIP OFF,"THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF MONEY. I'VE READ THE OTHER REVIEWS ON AMAZON. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS. THE DECEPTIVE ADVERTISMENT ON TV OF THIS GAME IS UNREAL. THE GRAPHICS ARE TERRIBLE (YOU BUILD A STRUCTURE AND IT SHOWS UP AS A WALLED DIRT MOUND), THE MEN YOU CONTROL ARE JUST BLUE AND RED CIRCLES. I'M USE TO GAMES LIKE (LORD OF THE RINGS) WHERE YOU CAN AT LEAST SEE THE MEN YOU CONTROL AND WHAT THEIR DOING. I'VE BOUGHT MY LAST GAME FROM (THQ/RELIC). I'LL ADMIT THAT I DON'T HAVE TOP OF THE LINE EQUIPMENT FOR GAMING BUT IT WORKS GREAT FOR THE GAME I'VE TRIED. I'LL STICK WITH ACITVISION AND EA GAMES."
2,Too Complicated,"This is a strategy game not a shooter game. One has to accomplish tasks to continue to move to the next level. There is no saving the game where you are at. If you fail to accomplish the task, you have to start over at the level. I am stuck at a level that is about one-half way through the game. I have tried to accomplish the task 5 or 6 times and can't seem to do it. Frankly, it seems impossible without some ""trick"", which I don't know. But, what is the point of that? I thought this would just be ""fun"". This game is not fun."
3,Horrible Vehicle AI; Poor weapons balance.,"They really should reduce the cost of allied tanks; up the lethality of Axis tanks. Improve AI for both tanks, so that they don't point their rear ends toward the enemy. Then improve the accuracy of shooting by tanks, they will repeatedly shoot into the ground and never change elevation or move to a better firing position. It would be great if you could set formations for the vehicles as well.since none of these things are done - its a pretty weak game. Though the graphics are great when you zoom into to see the little dudes fighting.See ya,Jim"
1,Fraught with BUGS,"The ingame movies are fantastic! The actual gameplay is very challenging. However, Relic does not support their product. Instead it is supported through volunteers that run the Relic Forum. And you will need support because the game has many issues.If you want to spend alot of money on a game and incessantly tweak your computer till it works, then this is the game for you. It is great when it works."
2,boring,"Thought it would be an action game,more a strategy,not like medal of honor or call to duty,not impressed being third person."
3,"nice small scratching post, but...","We had a large version of this scratching post, but needed one to fit in our motor home. This is the perfect size, however, the rope on the scratching post was not tight when it arrived and is slipping down. We needed it right away as we were traveling with our 2 cats and could not return it so we kept it eventhough it wasn't as pictured. Wish it was as it was pictured, but the cats really don't seem to mind and I'm glad we have it so they won't tear the funiture apart!"
4,Scratching Post,This is a quality scratcing post - very stable and doesn't seem to be easily tipped over. It would be nice to have one a bit taller and with a platform on the top but for a small cat this is fine.
3,Eh... it's ok,"Plot: The bad guys are trying to destroy Lodoss, and once again Parn, Deedlit and Kashue must stop them, but this time with some new help. In comes Spike, Leaf, Little Neese and others to help save Lodoss.My thoughts: It's.... ok. Very much like a role-playing game. The opening song and opening sequence is excellent, if only the rest of the show was as good. Spike has cool hair, and I like elves. Neese looks one way at first, then all of a sudden is drawn a different way. I've seen the first 7 (of 9) tapes, but the show hasn't given me much interest to watch the other two. The dub is bad, and I like dubbed anime. The redeeming quality? The ""Welcome to Lodoss Island"" SD shorts between the episodes are wonderful, very funny and well done. I wish you could buy just that part."
2,Poorly directed film fails to live up to originals,"Sloppy sequel to the first movies continues the original story four years later with the young knight Parn battling the returning Ashram, the dark knight. Then it jumps 10 years and passes the torch to a new group of heroes. Some very poor dialogue and a horribly heavy-handed narrative are somewhat redeemed by good character design and truly awe-inspiring visual ideas (the opening sequence is brilliant). The ""Welcome to Lodoss Island"" intermissions though meant to be funny, just come off as annoying."
4,Great product,"Great product for the price. Previous reviewers probably had incorrect set-ups. I have used this program for years, over 50 MIDI tracks with 8 hardware synths simultaneously, plus audio tracks - never had a problem. Very intuitive and user-friendly. Presently, an incredibly more sophisticated array of Cubase software is available from Steinberg."
3,A solid look into Wittgenstein's Religious Attitude,"Wittgenstein is primarily known for his work on philosophy of logic, language and mind, but he was a cult figure at Cambridge when he taught there in the first half of the 20th century.Part of this, I think, has to do with his eccentric but enduringly fascinating views on ethics and religion. In this book, the late Norman Malcolm, a protege of Wittgenstein's, examines a curioius remark Wittgenstein makes to his friend Maurice O'Drury--along the lines of 'seeing every problem from a religious point of view'. It's curious because W. was not religious in the traditional sense. Yet he was a deep thinker, passionate about his own attitude toward life. He was, in a sense, a grippingly spiritual man, and Malcolm's book is a worthwhile attempt to understand Wittgenstein's religious attitude toward life.I recommend it for those interested in Wittgenstein, religion or spirituality."
2,"Not sure what to say, i'm neutral","I'm neutral, because this supplement, among myriads, didn't cause any major impact on my health.So on a scale of effectiveness, here's what I say would impact:(1) genuine stem cells (NOT supplements) & nanotech ONLY after L.I.F.E. system diagnostics and only after detox via medical leeches and/or northernmostDeadSea mudpools. If it does not cause you a pull-pull sensation, that would mean it's not activated enough by the sun, and/or by first prepping inside salt-sea. Note that IV EDTA chelation & other forms of chelation did NOT work for me, nor did clay baths, MANY brands, nor did sulphur baths. Only the ON-SITE BLACK-SMELLY PULL-PULLING DeadSeaMudPools worked.(2) real food(3) supplements (and I've tried myriads of them). Take lysine, for example. The real-food forms of lysine do the trick for me much more than supplement forms."
1,Can I Get A Refund?,"The title of the book is completely misleading. There isn't anything in it that a competent coven leader would not know. The information that actually does cover Gardnerian/Alexandrian Wicca could more easily be gained from ""A Witch's Bible"" by the Farrar's.For the most part, this book is an introduction to Wicca and Witchcraft. The author, however, takes a lot of liberties with the history of the religion, the mechanics of magick, and the origin of texts. I would encourage a novice to be very circumspect at what they take as fact from this tome."
3,Competent introduction to Gardnerian and Alexandrian Craft,"This is a decent overview and introduction to Alexandrian and Gardnerian Craft. There are a few typos in the book and some points that can be mildly confusing, but overall the text is usable for either an outer court group or training in preparation for the 1st degree. However, I do not feel that the material stands completely on it's own and is not a replacement for coven training."
5,Digital Download available DIRECTLY from The Band! 2SJ.com,"Hello Champions, an OFFICIAL Digital Download of this EP (and the entire 2SJ Catalog!) is available directly from the band's official website webstore (2SJ.com) where it's available in MP3(V0) and in Hi-Res(.flac) formats!-=AA/2SJ"
5,I've got it!,"Hi Shawn,I'm a Skinnee fan from way back. I have ""Sing Earthboy Sing"" and it still makes me smile. I'll post it for sale soon.~BKK33"
3,Oracle Privacy and Security Auditing,I primarily purchased this book for help on Virtual Private Database (VPD) and Row Level Security (RLS). We use these features at work and need to expand on them. Something I did like about this book is that it is well written and covers many subject areas that are spread out over many different books in Oracle's documentation. The examples are not much more helpful than Oracle's and that is an area that could be improved on the second edition.The book is 672 pages and if it was formatted a little differently it would probably be closer to 300. The font is large and the pages are narrow.
1,SOX appears on the title only....,"Excellent book for general security information with Oracle (VPDs, Roles, Encryption and the rest)As an another review pointed out, the book is very light on SOX material and focuses instead on the HealthCare sector.If that's what you want..by all means, buy the book...A.Nanda is one of the very best DBAs out there and knows his material inside and out...If you need SOX and/or GLB, look elsewhere..."
1,Misleading and worthless,"I bought this book for understanding how to handle compliance in Oracle. No where in the book can you find details about HIPAA, SOX or GLBA complaince!!!! It was totally, completely, worthless for me!"
2,The Isle of Bad Books,Now if you've seen the title of this review and my rating don't get me wrong I love DELTORA. It's just that I hate this book. It was awful and the only reason I don't give it one star is I have to give the benefit of the doubt: it's Deltoran! If you just read THE CAVERN OF THE FEAR and wish to purchase THE ISLE OF ILLUSION (which is no doubt the case) take my advice and don't. It's completely horrible and not worthy of having DELTORA at the top. Just keep on truckin' to THE SHADOWLANDS that you'll find if you scroll up a little. Trust me the one part where there is action is in the three chapters before the last and the rest of it is dull and boring. I beg of you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!
3,so-so,This book is not top quility i agree but it is good and if you read the series that comes before it the characters and plot make more sense. I also agree that Tamora Pierce is waaaaaaaay better than Emily Rodda but she is worth it. I wouldn't buy this book but it is worth borrowing from the library.
3,Dissapointing Emily Rodda!,"Lief, Barda and Jasmine are now on their way to find the second piece of the magical Pirran Pipe.To do this, they must sail to an island, which is rumoured that the civilians breed evil monsters, to kill intruders.Lief, Barda and Jasmine find themselves getting eaten by man-eating slugs and other vicious monsters.But when they reach the island, they see the picture of poor and innocent people, trapped under a veil of darkness and light, where magical and evil man-eating spiders terrorize them and stomp the ground, to name themselves as master.To find the second piece and save the innocent people, Lief, Barda and Jasmine mustdestroy these spiders to enter the evil Isle of Illusion.I found thois book lacking any adventure or might, I know that the characters have gone a little simple and boring and this book, to me was dissapointing.But everyone has their own oppinion, and you may love it!"
3,fairly good,You get what you pay for and this product is no exception. It worked fine until a few months ago when it fell out of my pocket onto carpet and stoped working. Go with the sony. you wont be sorry.
3,Ok,"I just got the bear and i'm not sure how durable it is...he seems a little iffy on that part. But, he's got the most adorable face ever and he's very soft. The only drawback is he's not quite as big as I was expecting and he's made out of the stuff that sheds a lot, so fuzz gets everywhere and i'm almost positive he'll be bald after a while, but other than that...he's really a good bear and the delivery time on him was awesome!"
5,A True Hero,"I had earlier learned of some of Eugene Bullard's exploits, but Craig Lloyd's book spotlights an endless list of amazing achievements that seem unbelievable for any man to accomplish in just one lifetime. It's a shame Bullard's life has been up to now unexplored and uncelebrated. Hopefully this extremely well-researched biography will fix that."
4,Important story,"This is an important story that needs to be more widely told. The writing style is thick and seems more carefully academic than it needs to be. It might be a better fictional novel in order to get the important points across with regard to the continuing racism of the US and how it even pervaded France from US tourists through the racism encountered when he returned to the US. Regardless, it is an incredible story worth reading and I highly recommend it. I also recommend reading Queen Bess about the first black female pilot, Bessie Coleman."
5,The best book on unix shell programming I've read.,"I've used this book both as a beginner to unix and as a unix system programmer 10 years later. I would not do shell programming without it and an appropriate O'Reilly 'Unix in a nutshell' book. It is designed to be read end to end, introducing new topics bit by bit and expanding on them using numerous excellent examples which grow in complexity as the book progresses. This does give rise to my one complaint which is that while it is filled with useful tables and charts detailing various command options, etc., it can be difficult to find a particular table using the index since topics are spread throughout the book. Desipite this minor agravation, this book is in my list of 'top 10' must have unix programming books."
3,It's only good for beginner of c shell programming,It's only good for beginner of c shell programmin
4,Looked very decent on the trays,"They are cheese knives, it is hard to get excited about cheese knives, but, they held up and served our needs."
4,Tensions between Islamic and International Law,"Mayer assesses human rights in Islam by comparing Shariah law to international human rights standards. She usefully looks at the commentary of several Islamic scholars, as well as several case studies from countries that have adopted Islamic law, such as Sudan, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. She shows the tensions between Islam and human rights, but also how they can (or should) be compatible. For example, she cites several scholars who question whether the Prophet Muhammad ever executed anybody for apostasy, as opposed to mere political treason.Because the book covers so much ground, it can at times be superficial. However, it l paints a reasonably accurate picture of the tensions between the two legal systems and human rights challenges in the Muslim world."
4,"Cool models, powerful in-game...but only 20?","As with all GW sculpts these are awesome figurines. They're a bit delicate with their pikes but otherwise are pretty straightforward to put on their bases and paint.In game terms (especially War of the Ring) they're pretty powerful warriors and good heavy support for the Fallen Realms army or as allies for other lists. Their pikes especially make them a good numerous counter to Rohan.My only critique is that the box contains only 20 figures, as with the Army of the Dead box. Why? I don't understand, considering that you would need 4 more to fill-out a company but can only get command models or additional warriors in multiples of 3...which means you'll always be one short or have two extra. Which seems like a waste to me."
3,Softie muzzle,"We got this muzzle for our Rottie, who unfortunately eats poop. So, we couldn't use a muzzle with the opening around the mouth, because he still managed to eat it. This muzzle was the perfect solution. The buckle is strong enough that he hasn't been able to paw it open (which he did do with another brand), and it effectively stops him from eating poo. But, it is made for very large dogs and it does not hold up that well. We are on our 3rd in 2 years. Whenever our dog brushes up against something or paws it, the outer colored part rips. The muzzle is still effective but just looks like a mess. Then eventually he manages to tear the mesh away from the seam and we have to buy a new one. We keep getting it because we have tried many different kinds, and this one is the most effective one we've found."
4,Very good radio for the price,"I purchased 2 of these radios for my church. They work very well over the short distance we use them. The sound is clear and easy to hear, even in noisy environments.The only negative are the buttons marked ""PTT"" and ""Call"" instead of ""Talk"" and ""Buzz"" or something closer to the action performed. That confused a couple of our people.I will likely buy a couple more of these!"
2,"Some good feature, poor implementation","I used this radio for a long time. The reason I finally got rid of it was that it could not automatically switch between the walkie talkie and the fm radio. If a call came in, you heard a tone and had to manually switch to frs. The earphone jack is a mono jack, not stereo. The screen is rather hard to see, changing functions can be very confusing, and the volume goes from rather soft to louder than desired. WHAT VOX?"
4,Great Sound!,This has great sound! I pretty much agree with the other reviews and this why I bought it. The only thing I would add is that you may want to purchase a better pair of headphones. The headset that comes with it is not the best. The antishock is wonderful. I use this for walking and just love it!
4,"Enjoyable, Easy Questions, Questions Slightly Dated","This is a fun and fairly easy game. My husband and I (early 30s) play this when we're tired and want to wind down. The questions are mostly very easy, but can be a little tricky if you don't keep in mind that the questions were created 20+ years ago (many shows are off the air, questions about commercials that ran when we were kids, etc), that people our age would know, but kids these days probably wouldn't. So, some of the questions are pretty easy for adults (how many sides does a triangle have?) and some kids wouldn't know (In the commercial, how do you spell relief? (R-O-L-A-I-D-S)). Current trivia games for adults tend to be a little difficult for a casual game, so we like that these are easy and we can get most of them right."
2,poorly made,I bought these socks for my dad but had to return them. They are poorly made and not comfortable for him.
3,Diabetic Socks,They are excellent for keeping ankles free of pressure as required by diabetics. I prefer more padding on my socks for more comfort.
2,falling down socks,"These socks are very soft, so soft indeed that they won't stay up, they fall down around your ankles, and I don't have skinny legs. I had to send them back, they were too big and loose and I ordered according to my size."
1,socks not suitable for small woman,"socks too large and bulky for a woman (in the foot). the size around the ankle were fine, but too large to fit into size 8 woman's shoe for my 93 yo mom"
2,Extra roomy? Not so much.,"I purchased these for my diabetic father. He wears a 10.5 in mens--and these, while inexpensive, dug into his ankles pretty severely. The material is rough and cheap feeling, and started to lose it's elasticity after 2 washings.I wouldn't recommend them."
1,didn't even last 2 wears,Bought these for my father and after 2 wears he has a hole at the top of the sock. not worth even a dollar!
1,Disappointed,The sock has no shape to it. After I wore it about 30 minutes it started to slide off my foot. It gathered in the front of my shoe. I thought I was getting three pair for the price so I was disappointed with the value. Will never purchase again. Don't waste your money.
1,Keep looking!,"I wanted an inexpensive clock radio & CD player with relatively good sound. The CD quality is great, but after owning the clock for just one month, the radio tuning dial broke. Now I must guess the stations, as the indicator is stuck between 94 and 96. If you plan to use this clock primarily for the radio feature, there have to be better products on the market!"
1,I wish I had read these reviews first!,Ditto on all previous reviews. Nothing to commend this device.
1,Don't make the same mistake!,"I just wanted a simple and inexpensive clock radio/CD combination. However, the programming is pretty dumb, and will only default to the last setting before the clock is turned off. This makes the Audiovox useless for listening to a CD before going to bed and waking upto news radio in the morning. Unfortunately, I lost the receipt and packaging while moving and thus can't return it. I should have paid the extra money for the Timex. Plus the antenna is weak and the speakers sound terrible. The night glow of the clock as bright as a night light, but the contrast is so bad you can't read the time unless you're looking dead-on within two feet.Don't waste your time on this clock radio (all puns intended)."
5,excellent wiper blades,They fit perfectly on our 2004 Audi A4 wagon.They were easy to install.They work great... better than the originals.
4,Save your self some $$$,Works like a charm but be sure you're ordering the right one for your A4. I have a 2004 1.8T and I finally figured it out after ordering the wrong set (aero twin) initially.
5,Fits 2003 Audi A4 3.0 wipers perfectly,The blades fit my 2003 Audi A4 3.0 perfectly. They look exactly like the stock blades that came with the car and fit perfectly. Changing the blades out was a snap as well. I really liked the Amazon price. Kragen was charging me higher for the same blades (that too a custom order since they did not carry these. The blades are quiet & efficient in wiping the windshield.
4,"Blondie Chaplin, Ronnie Wood and Eric Clapton guest solos!!!","As far as this Rick Danko album is concerned, if you like the jammin' Java Blues, you will dig this album all the way. Great songs, good songs and a little more straight rockin' than anything The Band ever did.We also have some big hitters contributing solos here:Track 1 - What A Town - Guitar solo is credited to Ronnie Wood of Faces/Rolling Stones fame.Track 2 - Brainwash - Guitar solo is credited to the great Blondie Chaplin of The Flame/Beach Boys/Stones fame.Track 3 New Mexico - Guitar solo credited to the mighty Eric Clapton. Any Clapton is good Clapton.A nice solid solo effort from Danko. Wish there was a follow up, it would have been nice to hear him develop as a solo artist. Now all we need is the the remastered CD some bonus tracks..."
3,This is an eyes opening,This is a real eyes opening for people looking for answer of our personal participation in realising our dreams. I recommend itwith all my heart.
5,Feeling is the secret,"I love this book!! Even though it is a small book, it is so powerful. I recommend anyone to read this and their life will change.I just look on the inside of me and the answers are there."
2,Not the Same Quality as Original,"There something not quite right about this gel. It looks and feels like the original gel you get with the AntWorks ant farm, but... it's not the same. I admit the original ant farm got a little moldy after a couple of months, but it was manageable. This gel gets insanely moldy after a few days. After a month, we've had to scoop out so much mold there's hardly any gel left for the ants. I bought this to refill three separate AntFarm containers, and they all reacted the same. Unfortunately, this is the only seller I can find that sells the gel refill."
2,"Disappointed, didn't last 3 years - will avoid Samsung printer products in the future","Not much to say except that now this printer is failing miserably, lots of jams, random crashes and the software hangs up my PC's. The top part has broken so I have to carefully prop it up when I try to copy or scan, and I'm really the only person who uses this machine. We also replaced a part, the printer drum after it failed only after two years. I tried to talk my colleague out of replacing the part and saving the money for a better machine. This machine did not get an intensive amount of work and I expected it to last much longer. I will not purchase another Samsung printer."
1,Works well ... when it works,"This printer works well on all fronts that I tried (simple printing and scanning to USB thumb drives) except for a single problem - paper jams. Unfortunately the one thing that a printer should be able to do is print, and paper jams prevent that. I have tried different brands and styles of paper, and some work better than others. However without fail you will get beeps at least every 30 pages or so with paper jams. Once it gets into a jamming mode you often have to disassemble a surprisingly large number of the parts to eventually coax it into working again. It just isn't worth it. Unless you hate the person you are buying this for, save yourself the trouble and buy a different printer. Samsung used to make good stuff but lately they seem to be failing on all fronts. This printer definitely gets an F overall."
2,"trouble all the tiem, finally broken","when it's working, it works ok. I've used just under 3 years, I think I've shaken the toner catridge over 300 times. It always displays a message for low toner even after I replaced it with a brand new one. Now, it's completely broken. Belt transfer got broken and makes a lot of weird noise.It's a kind of frustration past 3 years of using this machine. I've never had this much of problem on any electronics I ever purchased in my life."
2,"Poor resolution, poor service","I've been a graphic designer for over 15 years and just started my own business. I bought this printer thinking it would be a good all-around deal - print/scan/copy/fax. Unfortunately, the print quality is just awful. I've used so many different printers in my life that I do know good from bad. I also called Samsung and they were no help. I have a Mac and when I said i was upgrading to Leopard this week, they said DON'T. After explaining that everything was printing heavy - no matter what setting/paper/computer... they said they would send a new drum. I just bought the thing 3 weeks ago. Then they called back to say their boss said they wouldn't send a drum and that I needed to call Apple. Luckily, I didn't waste my time and printed from a PC - and it was just as terrible. Also luckily, the store is accepting the return. No more Samsung for me."
1,Transfer Belt Error - avoid this printer,"After about 5 weeks of light use the printer had a paper jam, and subsequently is stuck with a ""transfer belt error"" and won't operate. Samsung sent us two replacement belts, neither of which worked. We've been without a printer for several weeks. Now we're just trying to just get either a replacement or refund, which has proven difficult so far."
4,Samsung color laser printer,"It is one of the lightest weight color laser printers. Color printing is a little slow, but cartridges are very easy to replace. Only problem is that there is no scanning software for the Macintosh.Samsung CLX-3160FN Color Laser Multifunction Printer"
1,Printer is not Reliable and Breaks,"Had it for a year in home environment. Already had to replace toner cartridge ($120), the laser cartridges are expensive and you have a waste toner tank that costs $15 every 2000 pages in addition to the toner which is pricy. Color is ok for graphs and presentations but horrible for photographs. My biggest complaint is reliabillty for a $400 printer. I will have to replace after less then 1.5 years."
1,Worst Purchase I Ever Made,I have owned this Printer/Copier/Fax/Scanner for 19 months. The problems started right out of the box and have continued almost daily. Tech support was less than useless - it was down right frustrating. The problems include 1) Paper feeder jams; 2) ADF jams (usually on the last few pages of a multi-page fax/scan job. This requires teh entire task to be restarted); 3) Waste Toner error; 4) any other error that can occur will- anything that can go wrong will go wrong. I would NEVER reccomend this unit to anyone as a purchase unless you are a glutton for punisment.
3,BEWARE FIRMWARE UPGRADE L=2006!!!,"If you bought an early version of this printer like I did, the day it came out, you have experienced some frustrations, but it works OK and for me it saved a ton of deskspace, so it was fine.It had some issues with network scanning and dropping jobs so I was happy to find a firmware update in July.Unfortunately, there is a typo in the example indicating that L4 date code is April 2007 when in fact it is April 2006.The instructions say to apply the firmware to all printers before March 2008 with a warning underneath not to apply it to 2006 printers.Long story short, it still prints, the other functions work better, graphics print fine or better, but text looks like it is in bold.Since the warranty is expired, diagnostics cost $80 with the total repair $80 to $160 if they can reflash the firmware and more if they have to replace the main board.Lovely!"
5,Great All Around Office System,"I bought this for my small business to replace a Ricoh brand I was having an issue with. Out of the box, this device worked just as claimed. This is extremely easy to use and setup. It took me less than 10 minutes to setup as a stand-alone printer, copier, scanner, and a fax. (I haven't tried the network capability, but it comes with a network-ready card). I am very happy with the quality of the both color and b/w outputs as well as the easy software it comes with. I would highly recommend this device to anyone!"
1,Badly designed,"Tends to stop working after a year due to the solenoid spring losing tension. This is a tiny spring in the driver mechanism. What's worse, it is almost impossible to find a replacement for the spring."
1,Not pleased with Printer,"This is the worst printer I have owned. I bought this printer to use in my small business. I wanted to print business cards, brochures, and envelopes. None of these functions work properly. I have wasted a lot of money on preprinted business cards because the printer will not feed them properly therefore they do not print properly. The envlopes may or may not feed through the printer. The flat top scanner for copies or scanning drags so that black lines appear streaked down the page. Now if you just want - black print on 20 lb paper - sure this printer is for you - but the rest of the ""features"" do not work and simply raise your blood pressure trying to make them work."
2,"Good for first year, okay for the next, and then junked it.","Used this printer in a home office with two people plus the kid's occasional school papers. Print quality was okay, but not nearly as good as my previous HP or brother laser printers which I got rid of to get an all-in-one to save space. Seems to go through quite a bit of toner, which wasn't the problem. Problem came with transfer belt error. Replaced. Now it's making a clicking noise which is out of my league and the Samsung repair guy needs $135 plus parts to come and fix it with parts averaging $58. Going to cut my losses and try to sell this new transfer belt along with all of my extra toner cartridges as another $200 is more than this basket case is worth to me."
2,only worked 1 1/2 years,"if you are looking for a well built quality printer, keep looking. this printer started having problems at one year, and quit working all together at 1 1/2 years. SAMSUNG is at the top of my do not buy list!"
2,Samsung,"Bought this printer a year ago and didn't want to review without some time with use. Print quality is OK. It is not for anyone who would like photo quality prints. It does the job. Slow to start everything-Fax-Print-Sleep. If you want to send a quick fax, you need to be ready to stand at the machine and wait a few seconds to warm up. The ink is expensive as you can imagine on any new machine. Lots of replacement parts-drum, ink waste cartiridge,and ink that they will be happy to sell you for years. It only holds a small stack of blank pages. I'm still waiting for some producer to make something that can do all at a reasonable cost. I'm not sure on the cost per page, but I seem to be buying something for the machine every couple months. I am in my own home office. Hope this is helpful to someone!"
1,This Printer Would Make a Great Boat Anchor,"Run, don't walk, away from this piece of garbage. Have had it for about 1.5 years for light small business printing. It appears that the transfer belt assembly is shot, a $200 part, far ahead of when I should be replacing it according to my service guy. Couple that with service costs to fix and a less than impressive user experience navigating through how to use it since day one, plus NEVER getting the scanner to work, this goes into my ""never again"" category.After reading some of these other reviews, I consider myself fortunate to have gone this long on what seems to be borrowed time with a ""somewhat"" working printer. For the $500 I paid for this and what it would cost me to fix it... I think I can do better with another vendor.Samsung should stick with TVs."
1,Junk,"I've had this for almost 2 years and it has broken twice, and now that it is out of warranty Samsung won't service it. Local repair shops can't get parts, so now I have to buy a new printer. I will not be buying another Samsung."
1,great if it worked - horrible support,"great idea, lots of problems with various toner error messages right out of the box, paper feed problems, and bad, rude customer support. I would avoid this product, it could cause you a lot of headaches and downtime despite it seeming like a good deal"
1,very bad machine!!!,"after reading all the reviews about this thing and I still went ahead I bought it!!!,( big dummy ). terrible machine it jams all the time and when it finally prints you get all kinds of terrible ckacking noises in the process, I would not recommed this product to anyone ( unless you do what I did; ignore all the bad reviews and try it for yourself )but be prepared to get frustated."
4,NETWORK Scanning!,I couldn't believe it had built in network scanning! For a home/small office this is great! You put in your stack of papers in the ADF and choose Scan to Network. Then simply pick which machine you want it to go to and BAM! that is where it saves the pdf or tiff to.This type of feature is not usually available in these all-in-one printers. Everything else works great also.
4,I like it,Not the country Mekons you might be familiar with. You can hear what the band orginally sounded like. This album sounds a lot like early Public Image Ltd. It's very good.
4,Wonderful creatures,The photos are superb and the text informative. My only wish is that the book was larger because it would be a great coffee table tome.
4,handy,"This book was exactly what we expected, small in size and informative but with plenty of pictures of different species of butterflies. Good quality photos too."
3,A World of Butterflies,This book was in rough shape. The back was broken away from the pages. I glued and taped the back in place and it is better. i bought it used.
4,The Good and the Bad,"I love the content of the book. However, when received the spine was broken away from the spine. I tried twice to contact the seller. I have yet to hear from them. I should not have to use a rubber band to hold the body of the book to the spine. It was advertised to be in fine condition. I believe the book broke in transit. I believe I should receive a credit to my credit card."
4,Great little toys,I bought these on sale at Target.com and have used them a bit. My kids love them and everyone who had seen them was impressed by the compact size and radio recieving. I am a girl who loves toys and these were great to have for fun. My kids use them like a cell phone to talk to each other. They are durable and easy to use. They are very compact and easy to put in your purse but they also have a clip so you can clip them to a belt or pants.
2,bad squelch,On the lower chanels I continuasally get bursts of static. I can't really compare it but I think it should mute out static when I'm not monitoring. It becomes very noisy.
1,I Wish I Had My Star Trek Walkie Talkies,"I wish I had my Star Trek Walkie Talkies... remember those? Yeah, that's right the ones from the 1970's which were CB channel 14 and only worked up to 50 feet away from each other. At least they were really really cool looking.Well, the Audiovox FR5302 Ultra Compact 14 Channel LCD 2-Way Radios have the same quality... POOR. As long as you're within shouting distance from each other they work great.Need I say anything more?DO NOT BUY THEM!!! THEY SUCK!!!"
1,Buyer beware!,"Bought this pair of walkie-talkies as a Christmas present for my son. One unit didn't work right out of the box. My son was very disappointed. Since Santa brought these, returning them to the store was out of the question, so we sent them to Audiovox to repair them. Recieved them back 27 days later and they still weren't fixed. Audiovox service supervisor was unwilling to send me replacements, wanted me to wait for them to try and repair unit again!My advice: buy Motorola walkie talkies."
3,Great in the right niche,"I picked these up as you couldn't beat the price, and they have a nice set of features. The range is not great, as others have said. The biggest problem I have is that the large orange button in the picture is the power switch. When I throw them in a daypack or travel bag they would often get accidentally turned on. I have to take a battery out to avoid this.However, for limited range use around the house/campsite, they've been really handy. The page feature is nice and the small size makes them easy to carry."
5,Pleased,Book was much cheaper on amazon. Paid $148 was $197 at college bookstore. Delivered ahead of estimate by 2-3 days and in perfect condition.
5,Comprehensive,"This is a product that I must recommend to everybody, even if they are not law students.Contains basic elements about commercial law and the explanations are more than satisfactory.It helps me a lot in the college, but it is very useful for anybody."
5,Excellent text,"Text is well-written, well-organized. It is far better than ALL the other legal textbooks I've had to deal with, which mostly drone on endlessly and give several different definitions for each term over the course of a chapter or in different chapters. This text explains concepts clearly and reinforces them with summaries. Succinct. Highly recommended."
4,memory,"received it in a few days, installed in an old computer running Linux Mint - everything worked.As always, Kingston memory works correctly."
1,Memorex dvd/cd writer,"It does not work!! After spending about an hour installing the software I went to write a dvd, that took 15 minutes, it did not write. I tried to find out where I could get help, but could find no place to call or E-mail. I would like to know if I'm doing something wrong, but have no where to turn. I'd really like this, but will not keep something that costs $50 to just sit on my shelf looking pretty. I'm very dissatisfied at this point and wonder if I should used Amazon again for a purchase like this."
5,Memorex Does It Again!!! Expectations Exceeded!!,Installation was fast and smooth. The external DVD runs Flawlessly. I have been using memorex products for such a very long time and never disappointed.Memorex 20x DVDRW DL USB 2.0 External Drive
1,Undeserving of 1 star rating,"Item is over 6 yrs old. Item kept freezing on me and did not meet expectations as advertised. I have no printer and therefore could not print return label. I had no choice but to eat the cost and will have to reconsider before investing additional funds through Amazon.comI am extremely disappointed and feel thoroughly robbed by my order and purchase. I made this purchase in good faith and did not expect any problems. I made an attempt to return the item but your website kept taking me in circles. Thus, not allowing me to complete my ""return-item"" attempt.In closing, I accept it as a valuable lesson. In other words, ""Experience is just another word for mistakes."""
1,Software failure,"Apparently I purchased this product from a company referred by Amazon. They were not at fault. The problem I encountered was that the software which came with the product (made by Nero) would not load on my computer. Nero made a feeble attempt at a correction, but ultimately said it was a Memorex problem. Memorex pointed fingers at Nero. As of yet I have not gotten the product to work. The vendor kindly offered to take it back, but I'm still trying to get it to work without the help of Memorex or Nero. I don't think I would buy from either Nero or Memorex again."
2,"Easy to use, but has quality issues","While some folks have had good luck with this burner, mine failed after a few months. I used it mostly to burn lightscribe labels onto DVDs created on my internal drive. After about 15 burns, it stopped mid burn and no longer works. Will not read much less write! Unfortunately I bought two of them. The other is for my wifes old laptop, and she simply has not used it yet. Hope she has better luck than I. FYI - the software was easy to use with a decent interface. All was good until the thing just broke. Too inexpensive to have fixed."
1,Not compatible with anything except Windows,I thought the days of hardware being exclusively Windows compatible were long gone but apparently not. I run Linux on all of my computers and this dvd burner turned out to be nothing but a giant paperweight. I tried to find drivers for it before giving up on it but there are simply none available. Shame on Memorex for making a device that is so exclusively for Windows operating systems only.
2,old,"This was like a 5 year old item they sold me, I have software newer then they gave me that I have already replaced with better"
3,Works okay,"Bought this drive to take the pressure off of the internal drive in my notebook. When it works, it is fast. But many times it errors out and I have to throw away the DVD. I'm using a Vista machine, and I think it's just not that compatible, even after downloading and installing the newest firmware. Probably wouldn't recommend to a friend or buy it again."
1,Don't Buy IT,After using it only for the second time I started to run into problems. The disc prints only part of the picture and it will say commuication error and just stop. It happens continously. Over and over and over.The discs are expensive and hard to find. Don't waste your money on this memorex Lightscribe burner.
4,Memorex 20x DVDRW DL USB 2.0 External Drive,"This product works great, I really like it and I would recommend it to every one that make copies of family movies and pictures."
5,Thicker consistency is much appreciated,"The first prunes are good, but much too runny past 6 months. The prunes with the oatmeal are much better for older babies who can use their hands to flail around. These stay on the spoon much better! It also skips the step of adding cereal grains to the food to make it a different consistency. Older babies will appreciate the different tastes as well!"
4,"good, not too sweet","Good and not too sweet. My son likes it. Banana favor is slight over powering the plum, but since my son likes banana, it was not a problem"
3,More Runny Baby Food,"I do not understand why some fruit and whole grain combos are thick and others, like this kind, are SO runny. Unless you mix in rice cereal with this it's impossible to feed to a baby without it getting everywhere. Other than that, my baby seems to like the taste."
4,Yummy!,"I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings. The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him. I also always taste anything I feed to my son, so again, I have high expectations. This food was a great deal, and we like the Earth's Best brand, so I bought some. My son loves it, and I think it tastes great. An easy way for breakfast on-the-go, instead of having to deal with mixing rice or oatmeal cereal and his fruit. The only warning I have is that I thought I would be getting a banana/grain & apricot/grain variety pack, but it is banana/apricot/grain all in one jar. The wording was a little confusing & the flavor on the jar pictured was really small. But it turned out to be a hit!"
2,Makes baby gassy!,My son liked the taste and has a nice thick texture. But he was sooooo gassy after eating this there is no way I can feed him the rest that I bought.
4,American blood; British soul,"Originally I wanted the English flag for my front plate, but most American's don't know what that is and are more familiar with the British flag. Plus, I do have some American pride, so this plate covered both areas of my concern. I have no complaints with the quality of the plate and I thought the price was fair. No issues with shipping."
1,I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SONY PRODUCT,"I, like to many other people, bought this Sony laptop...The DVD-RW never really worked that great but after 1-year it died completely...My girlfriend also bought a Sony Vaio a few months after I did and the DVD-RW died on hers too...Its amazing how things like this happen right after the warranty expires...Almost seems like the Sony engineers design them that way...My laptop overheats like some of the other reviews have stated...I find that if I continually blow the processor fan off with compressed air to keep the dust down it helps a little...Sony Technical support is a Joke...My suggestion...Don't buy Sony...Go with Toshiba...You will be much happier...As for me...I will never purchase another Sony product again..."
5,"Fast Pig, Great for the uncertain Desktop Convert","This thing is fast, its Gigantic, its Hot, its a desktop processor with a laptop fan, Its loudish, and its not super portable.Why is this good? Because it acts like a desktop too. If you have it plugged in and want all of the performance, youll have it. If you want to bring it somewhere, and plug it in, youll have it. If you want to roam in the park, unfettered by worldly concerns, specifically wifi and plugs, you dont got it.The software package is interesting, but weird, all sony all the time, but you can change that, from all that software left on your desktop.If you have any question about the desktop replacement computer, see this machine, it defines the genre."
1,Big Issues and no support,"This computer has big problems after a year of ownership. Sony will fix it for $700 DOLLARS!!! I have a very old IBM and a very OLD HP that are in better shape. I have other Sony products that are fine, but this is a lemon. I'm sure some of the folks who gave this a high rating have changed their opinion.The biggest disappointment was lack of Sony Service and lack of responsibility for all the latent defects."
3,Bella Boots,"They are pretty in the picture, but they fit my instep snugly, and I have a low one. It's a shame they are man made materials, so I can't even stretch them. By the way, they took all of the 6 weeks to deliver."
5,Beautiful and moving,"This album is one of my all time favorites, and has been for years. In fact, I think it's the only CD I've been moved to post a review about. I've listened to it countless times over the years and it still holds up. I find it a great work to listen to when dealing with a loss, it somehow helps one get through it.I find it hard to imagine how 'A Customer' dislikes it so much, but some people are just like that. 'Pretentious tripe' is an excellent description of his review; the music is excellent."
1,Pretentious tripe,"This particular CD is obviously tailored for the ""art"" type (you know Egon Schile, 20th century modernism, etc.). Within the context of a program this CD would be mildly interesting, but on its own, it is a garbled mess.This is nothing more than ""classical"" music for smart-guy indie-rock types who fancy themselves as bohemians living in 1919 Vienna. Do youself a favor and buy the Bartok string quartets for pure sonic modernism."
2,didn't fit my old Mercruiser 165,"The kit didn't fit my old 1973 Mercruiser 165 drive. Parts seemed to be good and from Sierra and would fit later models, just not mine. Was easy to return to Amazon and I ordered from SEI."
1,Not for sensitive skin.,"I reacted to this product, and I don't have sensitive skin. This is the first product I've ever reacted to. I found it actually drying around my eyes--it even gave me the added appearance of wrinkles, which I don't have. So I stopped using it as eye cream and used it on my tummy. Then I broke out in an itchy, bumpy rash! I was not impressed and threw out the rest of the product. I won't use it again. I'd rather stick with a natural brand that I know well like Burt's Bees or Body Shop."
5,Great for Everyday use,"I have been using this product for 6 months. On a daily basis I can see the difference. When I do not use the product, there is a drastic appearance under my eyes. The only downfall is that it is difficult not to apply on a daily basis, because of the drastic difference."
5,"Trouble at first, but now we love it!","Upon receiving our Dreamer Ditto, we found that the straps attaching the seats to the bottom of the jogger were frayed. We contacted Dreamer (although we bought the jogger from another vendor) and they sent us new replacement seats within days! We've never had such great customer service. We love our jogger and are thrilled with the product itself."
5,"Green, groovy","This is a pretty big load of fun for twenty bucks. You can see the disc spinning around while it plays. Neat. See-through headphones, too. Swell! The sound is like all digital media, too much treble, kinda thin, but they all sound like that to me, so I guess the sound is fine. One excellent feature that I wasn't expecting is the nickel-cadmium batter charger built in. That's excellent. While it lacks track clocks and a few bells and whistles, if you just want to listen to CDs, you can't go wrong with this one."
3,It's really an experimental thing,"I had the good fortune of seeing Calexico live recently, and they put on quite a good show. I've been a casual fan for a while but bought this CD after the Iron & Wine collaboration, which is really good.Here, they've put together a lot of found sounds, different ideas, and a hodgepodge of what they're into. The root is a southwest sound, but they really manage to go all over the board.After listening to it a few times, it gives you the sense of a band in search of something, maybe its own sound, but they don't quite get there on this album.These guys are experienced and great songwriters, and put on a great live show, but I'm waiting for thier masterpiece, which is going to come one of these days."
2,Fumbling towards focus,"A lazily haggard introduction into what would become a potently cultivated sound, it would still take another disc to develop into something that would persevere."
3,Mediocre compared to 1st,"After loving the first Calexico cd and finding that almost everyone I played it for felt the same, I was disappointed in ""Spoke."" It comes across more as a thrown together release of material the guys hadn't finished working on than the evocative, cool step beyond that it is perhaps intended to be. You can easily find other music in this genre that surpasses this cd, but it's still worthwhile if you're a dedicated Calexico fan."
3,Mediocre compared to 1st,"After loving ""Black Light"" and finding that almost everyone I played it for felt the same, I was disappointed in ""Spoke."" It comes across more as a thrown together release of material the guys hadn't finished working on than the evocative, cool step beyond that it is perhaps intended to be. You can easily find other music in this genre that surpasses this cd, but it's still worthwhile if you're a dedicated Calexico fan."
3,Runs extremely small,"I wear a size 10. I could not zip up the size Large that was sent and had to return it. I still have not received a refund for it. Unless you wear smaller than a size 10, this costume is not going to work for you, and Costume Craze's return policy is very stingy. It is very, very cute and I would re-order in a heartbeat if they went to an XL or XXL in this one."
4,Good Music for sleep,The music on this CD is very comfortable. My childrens have a good sleep in night with CD..Very satisfied!!
5,A great product,"I was a little sceptical given the price, but i bought one anyway. It offers great performance, sounds pretty good and i can play all my mp3s and even view digital photos. There's even an FM/AM radio and two additional Aux inputs. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
3,Lasts about 6-12 months..,"Good overall player with 1 limitation..This is my second or third one of these.. If you know you will probably be buying a 'real' home theater system in a year.. or, if you have found a really good deal on it.. then go ahead and grab it..BUT.. do keep in mind.. it will probably only last you about a year before the DVD part of it wears out.."
4,Excellent,"I received my Norcent DP1800 17.12.03. I was so excited with it. I set it up immediately. It sounds great. My wife and I first watch Lord of the Rings &quot;The Two Towers&quot; At first she said where is the bass, I thought it would have had more bass, and then it hit her wow what great sounds. She is not easily impressed, but she is with the DP1800. The only thing though is that the power can not be turned on or off with the remote. Other than that, I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a highly efficient low price range Home Theater System. It was a great buy."
3,Well.. .. I got it..,The set up is really easy for this.. but for some reason I can't get all the speakers to work. The color coded wires makes it idiot proof.. But the mid range speakers will not work.
1,"Might as well buy an ""Uncle Fred's DVD"" player","This is really awful. I should know by now that you get what you pay for....and this thing cost about $89 at a drug store.The sound quality is muddy. You can't turn it off/on from the remote provided. 2 speakers don't work at all and you have to jiggle the wires for the other 2 to work.There are no remote codes for ""Norcent"" on any of the universal remotes.I went to Norcent website and e-mailed them a couple of questions using the ""contact us"" link and the mail came back as undeliverable.Save yourself the headaches and spend a little more for a real brand."
3,"Good book, but dated","This book has some great illustrations and story lines that made sense in the 60s and 70s. It is not very politically correct though, with the two detectives accusing innocent people (animals!) of stealing and accosting them as they mind their own business. I love Richard Scarry and I have no problem with the un~PC plots but I can see how some people would. This is probably better though of as a classic for Richard Scarry Fans. One thing that I will say though, this is far more interesting for my 3 and a half year old than many other new books."
3,Indispensable - if you're related,"A friend recommended this book as family history. Unfortunately my leaf is from another tree. If you are a member of this family, the book is indispensable. But as genealogical info goes, it is very muddled. The author deals entirely in anecdotes of family members and in no particular order. There are no ancestral charts or family group sheets so you have to read each story and draw your own chart to know the relationships between all the members. I probably would have rated it higher if, after spending my time to read all the stories I had found any connection to my family. Being a genealogist, I look through a lot of books that do not relate directly to my family, but usually I only have to look in the index to find if I should dig deeper. This one had to be read to dig out the info . . . . and there was nothing there for me."
1,"junk, only works when it feels like it","Cheap, with a car kit. Worked well in my cold car. Didn't work in the warm house. I took it back the next day. A classic case of you get what you pay for."
4,Tasty Treats!,"While many of the recipes in this book are just too elaborate for me to try, I still enjoyed reading them. And the photos were works of art in themselves. As the book description says, these are recipes for gourmet meals that just happen to be served on bread!The author divides the sandwich recipes into open-faced, closed face, sort-of sandwiches, tea sandwiches, and several other categories.I am especially interested in trying the Pan Bagna, the Peppered Beef with Sauteed Greens and Caper Onion Mayonnaise, and the sandwich made with asparagus, poached eggs, prosciutto and fontina cheese.The Grilled Autostrada sandwich was yummy (four cured meats, peppers and provolone) as were several of the grilled sandwiches.The book also contains interesting food background information and some useful tips for adapting the recipes."
3,i guess it's OK,Gave as a gift. I guess they liked it. I'm sure there's some good sandwiches in there. Mmmmm sandwich. Go eat some Jason's Deli for a great sandwich!
4,Learn Skills to Date the Right Way,"I found this book extrememly easy to read and very insightful. In fact, I highlighted the pages as I studied it. I now want to go back and re-read the entire thing.It is a great book if you want help in identifying reoccurring problems in your dating life. It has great insight on what to look for in a mate as well as the skill needed in growing a relationship.I would reccomend it for Christians and non-Christians alike. The basic principals of the book can apply to everyone."
5,FABULOUS!!,"My family raved about ""Boundaries In Marriage"" (also written by the same authors as this book). I had never heard of the series before, but thought I would give this ""dating"" book a try. I have never spent so much time taking notes, (I didn't get the workbook and should have... but just ordered it) and highlighting things. It gave me a new sense of depth... for myself and for future relationships. It also ensured current beliefs and brought me to new levels that I otherwise wouldn't have obtained on my own. Though this book is based on the reader being Christian, the general idea is great for everyone... Christian or not!"
5,"Still in the process of reading, however...","this book, in the few chapters I've finished, has already given me a place to start in deciding & defining boundaries in my life - looking forward to finishing it!"
2,Why do we need to have a bible verse every other page?,"I started reading this book and was immediately shocked to read bible verses and references to god. I looked all over the cover for something labeling this book as a religious text, but there is nothing.It is completely unnecssisary and disturbing to have god referred to over and over and specific bible verses quoted in a psychological self-help book. It's as if the authors don't think they can convince us of the truth of what they are saying on their own and they have to refer to the bible every couple of pages for us to accept what they are saying.I am very disappointed that this is not labeled as a religious book. The advice seems to be sound, but it is unreadable if you don't believe in the judeo-christian bible. That would have been fine if the cover had been up-front about the religious slant in the text, but as is it undermines the whole thing."
3,boundairs,I had a difficult time with the concept of this book. I am in the process of re-reading it with my boyfriend with the intention of discussing each chapter together. I found it difficult to understand how boundaries help intimacy.
2,Interesting but the same old thing,"I am presently reading through this book and though, it has some interesting points, there are so many contradictions. I do not like the fact that the authors just brought out this book to refute Joshua Harris's book 'I kissed dating goodbye'. One of the contradictions- they talk about dating alot of people to get to know and then elsewhere they say being friends for a while is a good thing and then date. Okay, so which one am I supposed to do? As christians, we need to develop to that level of maturity Paul talks about and if we walk with Godly wisdom, I don't think we can make such errors when it comes to dating. There's nothing new or revolutionary in this book. I recommend you get it from the library instead spending money on it."
2,Disappointing,"I am reading this book with my church group and I am an older single, it seems geared more towards young people who are just starting out."
5,Safeguarding the sacred soul of self and others,"This book, now abridged in audio, cuts to the heart of relationship issues. Fundamentally, in relationships, many problems surfacing years into the future, can be prevented by focusing in on our own and our prospective mate/date's spiritual character and ability to grow. This book tackles the fundamental reason that many relationships do not suceed, a failure to establish the boundaries that safeguard the most precious soul. It is a book to give, to read and to ponder, about valuing the self and others as sacred creations."
5,Great info!,All theboundries books are awesome but this is great to go over with my teens!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!!!!! Love it alot!!!
5,Better title - Boundaries for relationships,Great book about how to have safe healthy relationships. I would recommend this book and information to everyone - for everyone has relationships.
4,How the tribe should be done,"Do you think the Children are misfits to Garou society? Not after this book. With a rich discussion of the history of the tribe, with nice gifts and excellent examples of Child characters, especially an Ahroun one, this is the Child tribebook to get. If you are thinking of running a Child, after reading this tribebook, you will want to. just be sure to avoid the newer Child tribebook; it does not compare to this one."
4,Grunge Is Not Dead Yet,"With Mudhoney disbanded there are precious few outlets remaining for raw cathartic rock & roll. The Monkeywrench's Electric Children - consisting of two former Mudhoney members - is perhaps the best alternative to emerge from modern music. The band formed in the early nineties to produce the album Clean as a Broke Dog Dick, but than took the rest of the decade off. Electric Children is a triumphant return. Everyone who claims grunge is dead has clearly never heard the very much alive music of The Monkeywrench. Comparable to the works of Mudhoney or Green River, The Monkeywrench has produced an exciting album (best played at high volumes) that stimulates adrenaline flow and is likely to irritate the average baby boomer at the same time. Songs like ""Love is a Spider"" & ""Bring On the Judgement Day"" incorporate different styles to create a dynamic blend of sound. Grunge is alive and The Monkeywrench is its wet nurse."
4,"Great ""walk-around"" lens.","This review is for DSLR beginners by a beginner. The 17mm end allows you to take a ""wide"" shot that brings in a lot of the scene left to right, whether it's a landscape or group of friends at a table. The 50mm end doesn't let you, say, zoom up closer to things - it's closer to what you see with your naked eye. I've taken the exact same shots with the Tamron versus the Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6, and this lens compares well as far as colors and sharpness. The f/2.8 allows you to take good pictures in low light situations. If you set your camera on Av mode with f/2.8, your close-ups will be sharp with a nice blurry background (bokeh.) I'll post some photos."
4,Great lens for available light and wedding photography.,"This lens features a good zoom range, that gives us nice wide-angle scenics and groups, mid-range couple shoots, and acceptable head-and-shoulder shots. The lens is of middle weight, but feels solid, and has a smooth zoom control.The internal focusing is quick, but a bit noisier than Canon USM designs, and does not allow for ""focus on demand"" (while still set to autofocus). When switched to manual, the focusing is easy to use.The lens comes standard with the petal type lens hood, and has a warranty considerably longer than Canon's.The real charm of this lens is the fast F2.8 throughout the zoom range. It's great for general available light photography, but at it's best as a wedding lens. The range will do the groups and couples, the larger aperture will increase our flash range, increase our ability to get the background to come out in flash shots, and increase the ability of the camera to focus accurately in low light."
4,Excellent sharp lens,"This lens lived up to the reviews, very sharp. Much sharper than the Canon 17-85 IS which I also own (and have now sold). I also have the 50mm 1.8 prime, and the Tamron is every bit as sharp.In fact, colors are much more saturated and there is a bit more contrast on the Tamron compared to the 50mm 1.8. If the 50mm wasn't so dirt cheap to begin with I'd be selling that too, since most of the time it's easier to shoot at 50mm with the Tamron than go through the hassle of changing lenses - especially since I don't have to sacrifice any image quality with the Tamron. I read the good reviews on this lens before buying but was still surprised just how good it is.AF will startle you at first, especially if you're used to quiet USM, but it's really no big deal after a few minutes."
2,I really wanted to like this lens,I use a Canon 60d. Had to return this lens. Auto focus did not work. Lens auto focus would keep searching(used in the middle of the day and outside). Canon external 430exII flash would not meter in low light with this lens attached. Had to step up to a Canon EF-S 17-55mm lens. Yes its 2X the cost but it works perfectly. Im sure others have not had this issue but i did.
3,Too Much Hype or a Bad Copy?,"I bought into the hype on the web for this lens and was very disappointed. The auto focus is slow and noise, the picture quality is on par with the Canon IS kit lens. It's a fast lens at f2.8 and does brighten things up in low light, however, the picture quality is not worth the price. Since it has no IS or VR functions, pictures taken indoors are often blurred. I returned the Tamron and got a Sigma 17-70mm f2.8-4.0 IS, now I'm 100% happier for the quality and sharpness out of the Sigma. Plus, you get another 20mm further reach on the long end. IMO, the IS function is far more important than a slightly faster f-stop if you take a lot of indoor pictures."
5,a sleeper of a lens,"The Tamron 17 - 50mm f/2.8 is a real sleeper of a lens. I do astrophotography and nothing illuminates (no pun intended) the quality of optics like imaging stars wide open while you are tracking on them. This lens is easily sharper and better color corrected than the three times more expensive Canon EFS 17 - 55mm. More impressive, infinity remains in the same spot whether you are at 17mm or 50mm.It does have trouble accurately auto focusing with the D60 body ... I find manual focusing much more accurate. Since I grew up in the manual focusing days this does not bother me. Another drawback is the lack of IS ... you don't really appreciate IS until you don't have it.For the money this lens is an absolute gem. Sharp corner to corner, even wide open, is something very few lenses can accomplish. I have both lenses and I have to admit that the Canon will get the nod for imaging where I might need IS. Everything else ... it's the Tamron."
5,Awesome lens!,This is a great lens! This is the second copy I now own. Having the fixed aperture allows this lens to focus in low light situations. My wife and I photograph weddings and this is our primary lens that covers most situations using Canon 40D and 50D cameras.
2,"Lens great!, But no lens hood",Product page says that an accessory lens hood was included with purchase. Shipment came in a timely manner but I found no lens hood in the box. I'm too lazy to return so I said f**&k it.
4,Very good overall,"This lens works quite well with my 300D. I've never owned an L lensso I can't make comparisons there, but I've tried it in differentlighting situations and it seems to perform consistently well. I wasquite pleased with the way it handled some night photos I took.On the down side it does seem to have a sweet spot as far asaperture goes. Photos appear softer at aperture extremes. I alsonoticed some heavy purple fringing on bare tree branches setagainst an overcast sky.Overall I think it is a good lens, a big improvement over the kit lens."
3,Know if the retailer is an authorized reseller,"I bought a Tamron 17 - 50 mm lens. Awesome price. Awesome lens. When I registered it with Tamron for the warranty, they came back and said the seller was not an authorized reseller, therefore the warranty is void. So, know what you're getting into. Hopefully, I'll have no issues with this lens and it won't be a problem, however, I have no warranty."
3,The Tamron 17-50 2.8 is a toy compared to the SONY 16-50 2.8,"Let me start by saying this is a good lens, and if all you want is good photos then buy this lens. If you want excellent photos spent the extra $200 and get the SONY 16-50MM 2.8 lens.We tried one of theses Tamron 17-50s for week, shot a wedding with it, edited the photos, and put it up on that other auction site. Although the photos were sharp and the AF was quick, the colors just weren't right. For a consumer that just wants good photos with the color a bit off I highly recommend this lens. For a professional shooting weddings I recommend that you stay away from this lens unless you want to spend a lot of extra time trying to get the skin tones right."
1,Didn't Work - returned the same day,"Immediately got an error message when I put this on my Canon body. (something about connections needing to be cleaned). I cleaned the connections and still got the same error message. Looking on the internet for a solution I found many people with the same issue. It can't be fixed. Sometimes it happens right away, and sometimes the lens works for awhile and then this happens. This was my first off brand lens and I am so disappointed. I will stick with Canon lenses, because some the trips I go on will only happen once and I need equipment that I can count on."
3,"so so ...no, sucks.","Wide open performance is oK. The build quality sucks, or should I say, is on par with the same mid-level junk that most companies are feeding us these days. Comparable build to the nikon 18-70. ( I like my wide tokina better but it's af noise is almost unusable in some situations.) On the tamron, without being mishandled or dropped the filter ring really loose after 3 months of use. It doesn't appear that it can be tightend down with the screws easily either. Also severe dust problems with back element after 4 months. If you're a pro or can afford it go with the nikon 17-55. You always get what you pay for and I think this is my last 3rd party lens."
4,"Sharp, Sharp, Sharp",Very sharp lens. The only thing I don't like is it is a bit slow to focus. This makes it a no go for action shots. It is fantastic for landscapes.
4,Excellent standard zoom,"Very nice lens. Tack sharp wide open, light weight for a f/2,8, nice color and contrast. I considered this or the Canon 17-55IS. I picked this one because of the price, and I'm thrilled with it. The only downside is AF. It's noisy and slow compared to USM lenses from Canon, but the thing I miss the most is the FTM you get with USM/HSM lenses.Handles well. The zoom ring is nice. However, the MF ring is not too good, but with the lack of FTM, I find myself not using it so much.Construction quality is decent, but it's certainly not a Canon L or Sigma EX.Apart from some minor downsides, it's a great lens capable of delivering amazing IQ. I don't give it a 5 star rating because of the AF."
4,Great Lens - Great Price - Super Fast Shipping,"Reading the reviews comparing Tamron and Sigma I was leery of buying the Tamron. Having already owned Sigmas I knew they were great quality and a strong build. I'm impressed with the Tamron though. It focused fast enough and at 17mm its really wide enough for anything I'll do. Constant aperture is nice, DOF is great at 2.8 and pictures are sharp. There are a few plastic parts on the lens, but its all top notch. If you're in the market and comparing the major aftermarket brands, whether money is a concern or not I'd still suggest this lens to a friend. 6 year warranty is a plus, and can't forget to mention Amazon here. I ordered this lens about 12 hours ago! It got halfway across the country and onto my camera within that time.I'll have images with this lens posted here soon (9.1.11): [...]Only drawback I would mention is the AF motor in video. On the Sony, with this lens, you can hear AF.No 5 stars because of plastic and AF motor."
5,Totally worth the money,"My husband bought it for me. I have a T3i, and this is the first semi-wide lens for me. I love it ove it love it! totally worth the price."
5,The Best selection of Quality and Price,"Good construction, I took some pictures whit 2.8 aperture and looks great. Good focus and crispy pictures. I recomend it for everyone."
2,Returning 2nd Copy. Tamron's Fault,"I'm returning my second copy of this lens due to severe front focusing issues. I've done some research and found that Amazon was given a bad lot. This time I'm getting a refund, and possibly giving it a third try from another retailer. Sorry Amazon. You've been great in letting me return and even admitted that there is a quality control issue with the lot that you have received from Tamron. TAMRON.. shame on you. You should pull all of the copies that Amazon has and reissue them a new set.Everyone really loves this lens when it works. Wish I knew."
2,Not So Great Lens,Own this lens but very disappointed with the image quality. My cheap Canon 50mm f1.8 lens produced much superior images. Would probably trade-in for Canon 16-35mm or 17-40mm lens in the near future.
5,One of my favorites to shoot with,"I love shooting with this lens, the f 2.8 is great and I've taken many good photos with it. Really nice autofocus, though kind of noisy. I mostly use it to shoot indoors where the lighting is low and there's not very much need to zoom in very close."
3,Best value but not as sharp as expected,"I purchased this lens for use with a Canon 40D. After reading the reviews here of how sharp it is, I decided to give it a try. I do believe I got a good copy and I didn't notice any issues with front focus, but my pictures weren't as sharp as I expected. The focus is fast although a bit noisy and the fast aperture is nice in low light. Its a nice indoor range for a cropped sensor. All in all its a best value, still I felt most of my pictures were lacking some contrast and sharpness. FWIW I shot in nothing but RAW on my Canon 40D, and could fix the contrast.Ultimately I sent it back and am now looking to replace this range with canon ""L"" glass. There's no substitute for L, if you can save up a little extra do it. If you're on a budget then this lens will produce some great shots just not consistently."
2,"Focus Problems Abound - Had 2 copies, both bad, returned for refund!","Although the lens is fast and built well enough I got two copies with the ""front focus"" problem. I returned both without hassle from Amazon and am going to buy the 18-200mm Canon lens instead, along with the 50mm f1.4. I found that most of my ""portrait"" type shooting was done at the 50mm end of the 17-50 anyway so the 50mm prime lens from Canon will fill that niche. Too bad the Tamron had the Front Focus problem b/c I did like the lens. Some, very few, of the autofocus pics were sharp but most were too soft to be acceptable. I found myself sitting in Manual Focus mode almost all the time (any time that an in-focus picture was important, which is ""always""). MF was very sharp though.If Tamron fixes the AF problem then this would be a great lens. Too bad."
4,Great lens if you get a good copy,"I bought one, gave it a try. All the pictures which were in focus were great. The problem was the consistent back-focusing. I guess I had a bad copy so I returned it. A great lens otherwise if you are on a budget."
4,Excellent walk-around lens,"The Good:You get a fast (f/2.8) and SHARP lens at a focal length that makes this just about perfect for leaving on the camera full-time. Some reviews make mention of field curvature, which results in blurred corners. I've seen no evidence of this. Center sharpness is excellent, borders are very good, and corners are good. Contrast and color are very good.The Bad:Focus speed is average. Focus accuracy will depend largely on the camera body, but on a 350d it is good (low light) to very good (bright light).The Ugly:Focus noise is LOUD; it emits a high pitched whine that can detract from shooting. This brings the score down to 4 points.Summary:You'll not find a sharper lens at this price. Live with the focus noise and enjoy amazingly sharp photos with nice contrast and color. Construction quality is average, but that's to be expected at this price."
4,Decent lens but some quirks...,"OK, I wanted a 17-55 mm zoom to complement my Sigma 35-300 zoom for my Canon Rebel XSi. After trying both the Sigma 18-55 mm f2.8 and this lens I chose the Tamron. While it is not quite as sharp as I like (Sigma has soft focus issues too) I could not justify the price of a Canon L series lens. This lens has met my expectations. It is reasonably fast. The autofocus is a bit noisy but not overly so and it allows me to have a lens that is an effective 28-88 mm zoom when factoring in the 1.6 crop factor for the APS-C sensor in the Rebel. There seems to be a bit of distortion when shooting at 17 mm at f2.8 but it is not extreme. Is it as fast and as tack sharp as a Canon L? No, but for the price it is a very good lens. The only complaint that I have with it is that it zooms in the opposite direction from Canon and Sigma lenses. For the price, I am happy and now I have a lens that allows me to shoot in low light without a flash in most conditions."
2,Not Sure About This One,"I spent months researching a lens to meet my wide-angle/zoom needs. This one always stayed in the back of my head. The Canon L lens of this type was always my favorite choice but it was way out of my price range. After reading reviews both positive and negative of this lens...good focus/bad focus I pulled the trigger on the purchase. Hoping I would be in the good focus category, out of the box I realized I was in the other group. This lens will not find sharp focus even in bright light on the wide end and on the zoom end and every range in between. I tried cleaning the contact points of my camera and lens to no avail. My next choice is to send it back to Tamron and get it repaired. Hopefully this will fix the problem. If not, I have an even bigger dilemma. Based on my experience with this lens, I would not recommend it. Maybe that will change if it is repairable."
2,Quality Issues: Not as sharp as my 28-135 kit lens,"I have a 40D with 28-135 IS kit lens. After read all positive reviews from this site, I ordered one but have return it since its picture quality even cannot match what I got from 28-135 kit lens of 40D. I also tried to use focus test chart to see if it is because focus problem, but focus is ok only the pictures are not as sharp as 28-135 kit lens. I also tried with tripod to isolate hand-shaking issue, but the picture is still not sharp. Anyway, I might got a bad copy. Sharpness for my test in the descending order is: Canon 50mm f/1.8 II, Canon 28-135mm (kit lens), and this one. If you buy this for low light, this one will not help, I got sharper picture with 28-135 IS than this one with handhold. For now I will stick with 28-138 IS till I have money for a canon L lens. If high speed is what you are looking for, don't forget canon 50mm f/1.8 II, you cannot beat it on quality/money."
1,"Front focusing, soft results, problems in low light","Tried and really wanted it to work, but the first copy had severe problems with focusing, most images came out soft, front focusing issues, slow focusing in low light. Tried a second sample, a little better, but still not acceptable. Obviously, Tamron has real quality problem issues. Switched to Canon 17-85IS and all problems magically went away, fast reliable focusing in any light and it is instant due to USM. Yes it is not a 2.8 Lens, but what's the point of 2.8 if it has problem focusing in low light? I thought one of the reasons to buy 2.8 was because of low light. Moral for me at least: stay away from third brand lenses."
3,"Great image quality, but I had to return it","My experience with this is on a Canon 50D. I really waffled on returning this lens. Shooting in good light results in really sharp, really vibrant photos. Unfortunately shooting indoors in low light results in a very low rate of ""great shots"" when it comes to focus. This lens seems to have a much harder time focusing indoors than my widest Canon lens (28-135mm f3.5-5.6). Combined with the lack of IS, and it makes for a mediocre indoor lens when shooting without a flash. Other things I didn't like were the focus motor noise (not horribly loud, but noticeable in a room) and the lack of full time manual focus (which is in the specs, but still a minus). Really I could have lived with everything if it were not for the slow inaccurate focus in low light. I almost kept it, but in the end decided to try the Canon 17-55mm F2.8 instead."
3,"Good optically, but be aware of problems","PROS:(+)The lens performs well, optically is very very good, the images are so pleasing.But please be aware of the problems.(-)Reliability: It broke down and I had to send it to Tamron, they did fix it under warranty but as with a car, you always want the most reliable product, not one you had to take to the mechanic.(-)Autofocus: The front/back focusing problems are serious with SOME SPECIFIC camera models. I have two camera bodies, it will work with one of them, but not with the other. It seems as newer cameras are released to the market, the lens is no longer compatible with them. It works with my SonyA350, but it does not with my SonyA560.Bottom line: I am keeping it by now, but for the future I will not go with third party lens, because the ""savings"" come with certain degree of risk that might not be worth it."
2,Not worth the money,"My copy for Canon cameras came with super stiff zoom ring, which is hard to swallow giving the price of the lens, not sure if this is a bad copy or just sub-par build generally.Another problem is very soft images especially at 50mm comparing to my Canon lens 60mm macro and 15-85mm.I was aware the lens lacks full-time manual focus override, but placement of the AF/MF switch on the lens and its stiffness was another big minus for me. On the other hand manual focus ring has nice feel to it and very easy to use.Overall it does not feel like it's worth the price, I'll stick with Canon for now."
2,"Excessive vignetting, take the full frame lens rather!","I returned this lens in fast succession as I saw the extent of vignetting, which it causes. Especially with f2.8 the problem is extreme in entire focal length range.You might verify this finding on several well known online sites, such as Photozone (dot de, not dot com!). The well known author of this site uses Norman Koren's Imatest software. With a Canon EOS-350D aka Rebel XT (1.6 magnification factor) this lens showed 1.0 step darkening in corners. Your mileage may vary, I found this really annoying. By the way, the same lens with a Nikon D200 shows already whopping 1.4 steps darkening of the edges, Nikon has slightly smaller sensors. This means that Tamron calculated too tight the image circle for this lens.Do yourself a favor and take rather the quite excellent Tamron 17-35 f/2.8 Di full 35mm frame lens! You will like your images much more, and you will be able to use the same lens with a full frame body."
4,Excellent lens for the price,On the Amazon star scale (1-5):Overall build quality 4Sharpness 3.5-4Autofocus 3.5-4Value for money 4.5-5It's a great everyday use lens with above average qualities. Definitely recommend.
4,Great all-round lens,"This lens is the best of everything. For only $460 you get a solid lens, that feels great in the hand. Its extremely sharp all around and the constant aperture is a must for low light and video. I really love this lens. I can approach almost any situation with it and get good composition. Plus, if you like video, the tamron 17-50 is perfect for a run and gun style of filming. The focus ring is sensitive, but it isn`t too short. The only problem I have found is with auto focusing. Its no the fastest and gets spot on focus 6 out of 10 times. The other 4 are close, but not perfect."
5,Great Music,"Marty is a wonderful musician and artist. To hear such great music produced live without the help of the studio and electronics is fabulous. This is what music should be, especially country music. Let's get back to being real."
5,Book 4 in an excellent series,"In Book 4 Seth continues his discussion on various topics including: ego, action, dreams, inner ego, personality, intuition, health and suggestion to name a few. This series is wonderful and fills in the gaps for those of us who have read all of the previously published material."
1,A pointless and very sloppy edition.,"Well-a last a long-awaited update to the, despite some minor quibbles, excellent 1994 price-guide by N. Umphred.... But it doesn't take more than a few minutes to discover that this is a serious letdown. This is basically a photo-copy of Umphred's Book with all the excellent details an easily readable format edited out? . This has apparently been compiled without ANY real research, insight or interest for that matter in Jazz Vinyl collecting. The only excuse for the release of this text-book-example-of-cashing-in-on-other-peoples-reputation-and-work is the unavailability of Umphred's edition. Owners of this previous edition should stay way clear of this..."
2,Routine-like,I find the prices very routine-like and without the updating you can expect.Necessary informations about label-designs are missing. Even for the most collectible label (Blue Note)
2,Inaccurate and unreliable source.,"I bought this in order to estimate the vaule of my collection for insurance puposes and wasted my money. The guide claims that, for example, my mono Jackie McLean ""Destination Out"" is worth $30. If I were to lose my copy due to fire or some other reason would I be able to find another copy for $30? Absolutely not. More like $60. Several listings are completely out of touch with the current market and subsequent repressings of older recordings are overpriced. If you really had no idea about the jazz LP market then this book will be of at least some help. You might be cheating yourself, however, if you are looking to appraise a jazz collection about which are are unfamiliar."
2,Unreliable,"Just a few examples of overpriced listings: Eddie Heywood, the Hi-Lo's, Harry James Columbia recordings, Ramsey Lewis Argo recordings, Ella Fitzgerald recordings in general (very few of her records are still sought after by collectors).On the other side of the spectrum, Pharoah Sanders' records are priced about the same as a typical Barry Manilow record would be (Sanders' records are collectible), Helen Merrill's Emarcy records are priced to about 1/10th of what they should be (they routinely hit around the $500-$800 range, not the $20-$80 range the author says), and in perhaps the most glaring underpricing, Reg Wilson's ""All By Himself"" (released in 1956 on the Herald label) is valued by the book as between $15-$50. In truth, an individual would be more likely to be struck by lightning - twice - than to ever stumble across a copy of that Wilson LP in his or her lifetime.This guide can serve as a general jazz LP discography, but it's a mistake to rely on its book values."
1,"Beware, impossible to get trial program off your PC","I downloaded the trial program and installed it. Decided it wasn't for me, and then tried to uninstall. Windows uninstall didn't recognize Smartdraw, and simply deleting the program folder won't work because something keeps blocking the delete function and giving me a message the deleting requires system admin permission (and I am signed on to the PC as system admin).Don't download the trial version unless you want it on your PC forever."
5,"Excellent software, great sales and support staff","Excellent software, great sales and support staff, easy to use and easy to teach customers how to use. Will definitely recommend this to customers in the future."
1,SmartDraw 2007,SmartDraw 2007 was not what I expected. The description of the product was not specific and this version of SmartDraw did not have all of the applications I wanted. I have sent 2 messages to the seller with no response. I am quite disappointed and would like a full refund.
1,Isn't What It Says,"SmartDraw says you get a ""Free Seven Day Trial"" which is total crap, because if you want to print anything, you'll get a big, fat watermark on your work. Unless of course you want to cough up a couple hundred bucks. I understand why they do this, but it feels creepy and deceptive to me. Your classic bait and switch. Also, doesn't work on Macs, even though every website designer I know uses Macs. Customer service is nice enough, but the product isn't very versatile."

1,Home Movie Quality,"A suggestion ~ When you visit the islands, use your own video camera. I guarantee the result will very likely be better than this amateur production. Mr. Osman either had consumed too much coffee or had the hiccups as he panned the scenes with jerky motions. The music is not good either. $11.97?? Save your money and avoid disappointment."
2,Quality decreased in time.,"I bought this personal CD player about a year ago and it was wonderful at first. It hardly ever skipped and it had great sound quality. It was great for about six months, but then the quality started to decrease. It skipped like crazy, and half the time it didn't even play. It wouldn't play anything for about four months, but then a little while ago, I got it to work again. But even then, it would skip so much I couldn't even listen to a CD on it. I even set it down flat on a table and didn't move and it STILL skipped. So, I do not recommend this product. Get a Sony or a Panasonic instead of wasting your money on this."
1,All it does is stop playing.,"I got this CD-player as a gift for Christmas. Not even a month later and I'm already thinking of going out and buying another. It is the worse! It will be in the middle of playing a song then it stops or it refuses to play at all. It consistently stops for no reason. It has anti-shock yet it stops when I move. Basically that's all it does... stop, stop, and stop! I am always changing the batteries and that doesn't make a difference. I can't believe the horrible quality of this product. It is really disappointing."
2,Bad Quality!,"This book was made without concerns on quality. Even for the price, it is too basic. Every two pages with almost no information and NO EXAMPLES OR EXCERCISES, there is a page for NOTES. Is this a joke? Every two pages with very basic information there is a BLANK page that could have been a place to place an example or a chart. It is a waste. I dont need to have 27 pages in blank from a book that is already very thin and that basically teaches you nothing. I can buy a notebook or use a PALM, but those two pages preceeding the blank page ARE THE NOTES! The paper is of bad quality and the text is printed too much towards the center of the book, so you have to open it too much. I am not an expert on Six Sigma, but I have read already four books about the subject. Dont buy this book. If you want a very basic book about Six Sigma, buy the book by George Eckes, The Six Sigma Revolution."
1,These movies are crap,"These films are of poor quality, they all look cinematographic shortcomings, poor image, bad sound and the theme is the worst. Do not throw your money in this collection of movies."
1,Second Hand Music,"As much as we enjoyed Bobby Bare's music we thought we were buying a CD with ALL HIS ORIGINAL RECORDINGS of music we loved. DON""T BE FOOLED - These are songs that are NOT the origional recordings heard on the radio. They are either practice sessions or recordings that didn't meet the muster of the producer."
5,Amazing grace,"Not only beautiful but effective, I find listening to this cd very helpful to meditation. Last evening I felt the bowls were ringing me."
4,evolution in progress,"When compared to earlier work such as ""Tropics and Meridians,"" ""Four Great Points"" comes off languid and melodic. Though it still packs some of the abrasive punch of the older material, this is a more developed effort from this ever-interesting band."
1,Missing Pieces,"I purchased this unit after reading the product details and online searches. The player does not have a dual cassette.. there is no cassette player. In it's place is a cd holder. Not many use cassettes anymore, but I do. I cannot believe Audiovox would rip this important feature out for a storage unit. Also, the remote control said.. two double A's.. The good thing is that it came with a battery because it's a pricey one. The unit is oversized, the sound ok but the features are minimum. The buttons are very small to read.. & not very accesable..again, thanks for the remote. Very disappointed in this. It's easy to hook up.. but my old sharp player was sleek and much better quality. I would advise.. call before buying to make sure the product details.. are correct."
3,"eh, it's okay","This is an entry-level Forstner set. On the bright side, there are plenty of sizes, and a cheap wooden case. But don't expect to be getting top-end quality for cheap with this- the case is pitiful, only slightly better than no case at all. And the quality of the bits isn't up to production standards.Still, this is a good starter set for a novice woodworker, about on the quality one would expect from Harbor Freight."
1,A real disappointment,"Although I'm well aware ""you get what you pay for"", I am still very dissappointed with the quality of the bits. I've had this set for over a year now and have used many of them, each bit has dulled very quickly. The latest example was last weekend, using a previously unused bit, I drilled eight 1/4"" deep holes in Doug Fir and felt a substantial loss in sharpness by about the 5th hole - had to pull the drill press handle hard, take a series of very short plunges and wait for the smoke to clear.I'm now buying quality bits as I need them. I would not recommend this set for any purpose. Save your money."
2,You get what you pay for,"This set is cheap, but the quality isn't there. I haven't used the bits yet, but the cutting edges on all bits were very dull and uneven. Expect to spend some time sharpening the to make them useful. I imagine they would burn the wood and produce a poor cut without sharpening."
3,A FINE STARTER SET,"THE QUALITY OF THESE BITS IS JUST FAIR COMPARED TO BITS COSTING MUCH MORE.FOR THE OCCASIONAL USER, THEY ARE OK."
4,value,"Excellent balsamic vinegar, dark and syrupy, with deep flavor. Not the authentic balsamic vinegar, but the price is right."
1,wrong title,was the item for sale really a rally squirrel shirt or a nebraska cornhuskers shirt. Please clarifywhen you post items
5,Fast shipping,This is an awesome shirt depicting the 2011 world series champion and the rally squirrel that helped them find their way to the top.
4,Good ingredients but needs work,"I got this book because I had just been down in the RI/CT area and the premise sounded interesting. In fact, the plot was interesting, the concepts were good and the method of murder something I have never heard of in real life or in books so that was intriguing. The writing style is not that great, conversations are sometimes hard to follow and some scenes seem repetitive and the pace could have been picked up. Also the heroine is imbued with too much goodness : the ""native Block Islanders"" are described as keeping to themselves yet they take to her immediately? And can she really cure an alcoholic by meeting him??All in all the author has great ideas and shows great promise but needs a better editor."
4,Great product & good shipping,"I've been looking for a good turkish coffee for a while, I found this one and read the reviews and when I tried it, it was exactly as the one I used to have in the old country. the product was shipped and delivered in a timely fashion, I'm very pleased.""oh yeah and some other sellers will sell you expired coffee but this seller put on their logo that they never sell out of date coffee"""
5,focus,"shipping news is a mix of the best sounds of rodan and june of 44, but this disc does not limit itself. unexpected samples and guitar technique make for an exceptionally original listen. jeff mueller is one of the most emotional guitarists and vocalists i have heard, and he really shines here. a bit on the short side, this disc takes one on a bipolar trek across the sea. highly recommended."
3,Save half,"Middle-of-the-road mixture of indie, slow-core and math rock yields surprisingly few memorable numbers despite decent dosages of purposeful interplay dispersed throughout."
2,What's in a spread,Although this book has good explainations of the cards and very vivid pictures from various decks it lacks a good explaination of tarot spreads. It demonstrates a tarot spread through the first person by walking you through someome's personal reading. This only gives one interpretation of the location of the card within the tarot spread. There is no discussion on how the locations of the card within the spread relate to each other.This is a good book to provide example to a beginner but those seeking more in depth knowledge will find it lacking.
1,cost the same as an ipod nano!,"Why buy this when you can get an ipod nano with color screen and music capability, and can hold your work files and photos! I don't see how anyone would buy one of these now at this price..."
1,"bad, bad, bad..","It is a very bad book, very bad.The author uses filthy vocabulary thru ought the entire book. This book is only about sex, drugs and filthy words.It is one of the worse backpacking books I have ever read. I stopped reading it half way through. I can't believe how much garbage can be published."
5,Clearly the best book in Amazon's vast catalog,"Never before in this institution's proud history has a book captured the essence of the museum and its breathtaking collection like this one does.Ms. Jackson and Mr. Stankowicz will forever be remembered in the annals of bad art history for their important contributions.---Jerry Reilly,Executive Director,Museum Of Bad Art"
2,Trying To Push What Doesn't Exist,"In my opinion, the core of this book is a rehash of what was already brilliantly discovered and documented by Jed Davis in "" Spinner Fishing for Steelhead, Salmon and Trout. "" I applaud Kageyama's effort in trying to ask important questions but Kagemaya pushes it too far by suggesting theories that are weak or are unproven.For example, he claims the reason black works so well in bright sunlight is because of the contrast between the white surface and the black blade. I tend to agree with Jed Davis that black "" provides presence without spooking fish. "" Further explanation in this regard is superfluous.I think these "" How Fish See "" books are important because anglers have always asked these questions about what fish see. But the real question here is this: Is there anything here that, from a practical point of view, can help you with your fishing? In this case, not much."
1,Fish don't have human retinas!,"I applaud Dr. Kageyama's energy and interest in this area of great importance to the fishing community. However, as a vision science researcher, I was deeply disappointed at the lack of Kageyama's familiarity with the literature on the visual system of fish, especially Rainbow Trout, Goldfish, and Walleye. (See the journal Vision Research and the work of Edwin Land for many examples.) As an example, the Rainbow Trout is known to have *four* types of photoreceptors; humans have three. There are species that are sensitive to the *polarization* of light; humans have no such sensitivity. These shortcomings, in addition to the use of photography to document what fish might see, leave the work on very shakey theoretical ground. (Photographic film has *yet another* set of sensitivity functions to the color spectrum, neither fish or human!) The definitive work still needs to be written. Perhaps Dr. Kageyama will provide a second edition."
4,fish vision,"Colin presents much useful info, and some controversial ideas. He gets us thinking about fish vision -- That's important.I agree with most of Colin's theories, but some need more research.Many eye-opening, underwater, color photos -- You will select baits differently after you read this book.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
1,Shallow and Unorganized,"This book could have been a very valuable resource for all steelheaders, both gear and fly; however, the book is filled with very limited or incomplete explanations. Accordingly, the information is presented in a manner that does not allow the angler to apply the information when on the water. Also, the photos are not presented in a methodical and systematic manner to cover all situations, i.e. different light conditions in each of the water clarity conditions we encounter. The photos also could have been more helpful if each of the colors was indentified to show the effect of the different water and lighting conditions on such color."
1,Author has an ego,"This book is not that original (and wasn't when it was published). Save your money and check out a copy from the local library and make color copies of some of the photos that show under water color changes (the only worthwhile part of the text). Additionally, it is worth noting that large sections of the book are essentially book reports on other well written and researched texts."
2,DMX can you hear me??,"It's a naseauting example of our twisted popular ideology to see so many people relieved, elated, that DMX is now ""redeemed"" or relieved otherwise.Spiritually yearning? You bet. But spiritually satisfied.... ""out of the woods,"" if you will? Nuh uh. Go read the book of 1 John.I pray for this man; though accepted into the beloved of THIS WORLD, there is not one reason to believe his soul has yet come to God's waters.Please pray for him, especially through Isaiah 55, and examine yourself according to Ephisians (and 1 John) that you also are not plummeting toward Hell at terminal velocity.I am a Christian minister of the true God. That said, go ahead and judge me- call me all the names a sinful unregenerate lost person calls God's servants. I've heard them before. Then accuse me of doing what you do; you always do.But after all that, stop bowing to the god of fame and money and worldly success and go to the Bible, or men and women who know the BIBLE, and ""count the cost"" beloved!"
5,I loved the book..,"This book was well written in my opinion. It definitely gives the reader, an insight on who DMX is. I thought the book was written with honesty and it took courage to for X reveal certain things about himself. He had me sitting in AWE a couple of times while reading the book. I listened to all his cds over and you can hear about the struggles he talks about in his book.Much love to X and the ""beast"" within that he refers to in the book."
5,Highly Recommended,"If you really want to read a book and find out a brother's psyche and why he do the things he do, then read this BOOK! Now, I know who DMX is, I don't listen to his music. But I appreciate the time he took to write his life story because to be real,because we got some brothers like DMX out there, and they need to take the time and read this book. We need to know why some brothers go bad and some go good.Why is it that he did? Mind you, this book is raw, you may not appreciate him cussing up in here, it seemed that he kept going to jail and group homes and not doing well in some school and yet, he did do something positive with his life, then check it out.We need to take this book to these young brothers who don't know what they want to do and show them that it don't have to be like that. I would recommend it along with Judge Greg Mathis' Inner City Miracle."
5,"QUESTION, SOME1 HELP PLZ!!!","Very simply me and me mate both huge DMX fans, he is Asain and I gonna buy him the book for his B-Day! Now... I heard X make's a comment about Asain people or he did'nt like an Asain kid more to the point! He writes about it is his book as someone has already stated on this website, now wos it a racist thing? Did he just not like him? Wot was the beef between them? Some1 please help me out, as soon as possible his B-Day in 1 week! Thankz, OMZ!"
5,Ever Always Real Life,"This is the best book I've ever read in my life, which says a lot. I recommend this to anyone who likes DMX, but this ain't for your lil' son or daughter. It'z an all to real view of his life, unaltered. It tells in graphic detail the abuse he went through, and how he overcame all of life's struggles. It's all too real, the storiez he tells. It totally changed my view of DMX, I respect him so much more. He's gone through a lot. some of his comments are quite disturbing- ""I found out that if you but 2 roaches in a jar with a piece of hot dog, all of a sudden you'll see little white eggs all over. Baby roach eggs!"" There's only one thing I didn't like bout this book- he describes in 100% completely graphic detail how his pitt tore up a cat and racoon. But overall, I believe this book is a great eye-opener to the ""real"" street life, a must read for many."
4,Hawaii Travel,"This book is a little step back in time when travel to Hawaii was new for most Americans.. If you enjoy mid-century style this book will take you back to the era of teased hair, tans, bright dresses and celebration. Nice coffee table book to help pass the long, dark, snowy winter and escape to the land of open arms, warm sunshine and hospitality."
4,A very good CD,"this is another great CD from fighting gravity, one of my favorite bands. For fans of the band, this is another great CD to add to your collection. For newcomers, i would suggest Hello Cleveland or Forever = 1 day as a first taste of the music, but this CD is good as well. one of the best things about the band is their truly individual sound - i really can't think of many other bands like them. They're variety of ska definitly grows on you and is always worth a listen!"
4,Nice Egyptian designs,"Charlene has taken some representative Egyptian motifs and produced them in light blue plastic stencils. There are several individual design motifs, from Neffertiti, a scarab and other bugs, to the eye of Ra. There is also one Egyptian border design which is quite nice.I would have preferred a few more designs that were smaller. But, the designs are fairly large, so even kids could use them with success. Great fun."
2,"Looks Nice, but Look Closer!","My brother owns this product, and I loved the look of it, so I considered buying it. But on further review, I found it a not-so desirable purchase. The vertical loading cd player is pretty nerve-wracking, and not that easy to insert. You can easily scratch a cd trying to put it in too fast. I really like the look of it, but that's about it for this player. The buttons are not placed that well, and the sound quality is not very desirable. At a decent price, it might be tempting, but I would go to a higher grade radio if I were you."
5,This Book is A Real Catch,"Middleton's book is a real treat. Not only do you get some wonderful tales about fishing in the Smokey Mountain National Park, but you also get some insight into the culture of those living in the area. IN effect, you getting a fishing tale with people who appear to be other worldly and unreal. The fishing takes a back seat to tales of the author interacting with these people, but it is still a fishing book. I would get it and enjoy it because it will cause, or should anyway, you to question why you fish. Great book!!!!"
4,Puritan Reformed Counsel on every subject of life,This resources is packed with insight on advice for every trouble in life imaginable. A collection of the experienced pastor-teacher's insights for other pastors. Baxter lived the life of the servant-pastor and knew what worked and what did not for those God loves so much. He also knew the condition of all men's hearts and spoke to that as well. Everyone interested in Biblical counselling will find this book useful and handy as a reference.
4,Digging up my roots,Maternal lineage can be a bit difficult to trace. This book provided a goodly degree of assistance while reintroducing me to many other family names I had known as a child.
4,A man who makes the perfect rifle,"A Review by NickThe Rifle is a very well written book about a man who makes the perfect rifle. This rifle makes it through both world wars, and tracks up to present day. This book is basically saying that that if we didn't have any guns that we would be better off. I did enjoy reading this book but I do not agree with its contents. It has a very right wing consecutive view on gunsI really liked reading this book, it was easy to follow and well written. I like the way the authorfollowed the rifle through time as it was passed down from generation to generation Another thing I liked about this book is how easy it is to understand and follow. You can tell the author new what he was doing when he wrote this book. . I did not like the books view on guns, it basically says gun are the devil they should be destroyed.I think anybody would like this book especially people who hate guns."
4,The Rifle,"The Rifle by Gary Paulsen, is about a rifle that was made in 1768. It was considered the perfect rifle. It was made by Cornish McManus, who sold it to John Byam. He turned out to be a famous sharpshooter in the American Revolution. The Rifle was a great book because it showed how a gun can be harmful."
4,Good,Simple little story. I dont know squat about guns. I find it very hard to belive that the gun was still working. Well like I said I know nothing about guns. I would say not a bad read. It not going change lives and surely it is not an anti-gun book or what ever those NRA pukes think...
2,The Rifle,I read the book the Rifle and did not enjoy it very much. I beleive Gary Paulsen has written many better books than this one. I read the book and was waiting for a climax the whole book but just never seemed to happen. Although I thuoght the beginging was ver interseting the rest of the book sort of dragged out the entire time. If you plan to read this book dont come in with too high of expectations but could be interesting to some people but for me it was not. Good Luck with it and have a fun time reading.
3,This book was ok.,"Hi my name is Shannon Reimer I live in Bellmore, N.Y. I read the book The Rifle by Gary Paulsen and I liked this book very much. I think the book wasn't too hard to read but there were words I didn't know. I think the length of the book was just right. It was interesting to read because there was alot of information about the rifle. This was a serious book to read. I think that this book taught alot about the rifle.I think there was alot happening to keep me interested in the book"
3,It was okay.,"Hi, my name is Scott Moscola. I am thirteen years old. I live in Bellmore, New York. I thought the book was pretty good in some ways and weird in other ways. The length of the book was 105 pages. Some of the reading is easy and other parts are difficult. I felt that the author tried to make the book upsetting and serious. The book taught me a lot of things. One of these things was don't play with guns because you can get badly hurt. There were a lot of good details in the book. I thougth it was good. I felt they were talking too much about the rifle in this book. I wish the author talked more about the characters in the book"
3,The Rifle,"I enjoyed the first chapter of ""The Rifle"". It is the story of gunmaker, Cornish McManus, and John Byam who bought and used the gun in the Revolutionary War. The story then slowed down and the final part with the violent killing of a child was unlike any of Paulsen's other novels. It was almost as he was saying to the reader that guns do indeed kill regardless of what people do. This is the first book I've ever read by Gary Paulsen that I didn't totally enjoy."
4,Lots of exciting moments and figurative language.,"I liked this book a lot. Very exciting with lots of action. Byam, the main character, is brave and creative. I am in 5th grade and recommend this book. Enjoy!"
4,[Super Book !],This is one of the best books I ever read. Gary Paulsen has wrote another must have book! He is my favorite author. This is an adventure/mystery about a civil war rifle. I think that anybody could read this Super Book. I liked it because it's by Gary Paulsen.
3,Paulsen has an axe to grind. . .,"He wants to show that guns kill, period. The first half of the book is beautifully detailed, but the second half is too stereotyped. Anyone who likes guns in the twentieth century is either an NRA Christian fanatic obsessed with Waco or an idot who reveres Elvis velvet paintings. As a high school English teacher who lives in a rural area where, on the first day of deer season, almost every male is out of school, I had hoped to find something to capture the interest of the boys who would rather hunt than read. I think this would do it, but I already know where the arguments would end."
4,One of Gary Paulsen's Greatest Books,Gary Paulsen's The Rifle was a very patriotic and informative book. I learned about the Revolutionary War like the rules of battle and who to kill first. The Rifle helped make the United States what it is today. The book is written very nicely so you know what year it is and where you are in the book. Paulsen is teaching us that guns are good if in the right hands and if used properly.
4,Review By JH,The book The Rifle is a excellent book. The book had my attention for the whole time I read it. Even though the book was contradictory to my belif that people kill people and not guns it was interesting to look at the other way people view the matter. The book makes as though the gun is out to make and break people similar to the ring of power in the Lord of Rings. I won't wreck the ending because I think that you should by this book and see for yourself how good it is.
1,If Only It Had Ended After 50 Pages,"What could have been an interesting look at the life of an object built during the American Revolution, becomes muddled by a severely bias political message. The brush Paulsen uses to paint those who actually believe in the rights guaranteed by the Constitution is so broad, it's naive at best and purposely meant to indoctrinate at worst.The first fifty or so pages are very well-written and concisely explain what life would have been like in 1776. I possibly could have overlooked the unbelievable ending if he hadn't dedicated several pages before to a rabbit-trail rant about a basically unrelated ""right-winger"" who briefly owns the rifle. That made it obvious I wasn't supposed to take the outcome as just a horrific accident."
1,Lack of any real knowledge,"First of all the rifle is a flint lock, with The Frizen open which exposes the Pan where the primer powder would of been placed to ignite the main charge in the barrel is missing.Pity, The dude pushes an agenda, and sure as hell won't let facts about Flintlock rifles, muddy up his story.Continues the missinformation and lies that the anti-gun crowd continue to use to push their agenda.KWWyoming"
2,I did want to like it though,"Using a style a bit like that of William Burroughs, Acker weaves a tale of various girls struggling against (society, men, each other, etc.). There are moments of crisp clarity where Acker conveys aspects of the story she's telling with the potent voices she uses, but these are not often enough to bring the story together except for the dedicated transgressive reader. This is the type of book that relies more on voice and atmosphere than on linear storylines, and Acker does succeed in giving us fascinating characters, but I was still left bewildered and numb by the end, as well as left wondering what this book was meant to convey."
3,Could not get into it.,"Normally I am a huge fan of Kathy Acker, not this. Her style is there but it's jumbled and incoherent."
2,Breaking all literary rules may not be so good,"I realize that it is the 90's; however, I'm quite disappointed at the constant use of offensive language, sex and dream-state illusions which depict drug use. Credit has to be given to Kathy because she accomplished to involve her audience and upset some of us."
4,Right ho!,"Huh? I don't get it. Pirate girls are cool though. Maybe if I were a woman I could swallow this book whole then spit it back out, transform myself, die, turn into a rat and all kinds of groovy stuff. I guess liked it anyway."
1,Terrible waste of paper...neo-dadaist crap.,"Kathy Acker has struck a new low for novels. This was singuatly the worst example of slaughtering trees needlessly. The plot is not worth discussing(I couldn't really follow it anyway), the book is mainly a screed against men and its readers. Inane dialogue and no feeling of setting. Calling this anything but a waste of paper would be a travestyBy the way, the neo-Dadaist reference is to an art movement in the '20s to ""destroy"" art by flouting conventions, and that is an apt analogy for this book."
2,Toshiba MK6025GAS Hard Drive,"The new hard drive did not work in two divices where the same model hard drive has worked before. Returned it for a replacement, but the merchant refunded the purchase price instead of sending a replacement."
2,Allergic to certain aromas? Beware!,"Recently purchased and used tried this soap. The soap, itself, may be hypoallergenic, but the fragrance is definitely not. The aroma is very strong and of a type that caused a strong reaction by my sinuses. The closest I can come to describing the fragrance is to compare it to Irish Spring bath soap. I don't know if they've ever toned down it's aroma, but when it originally came out I couldn't even handle being around a sealed package of it, much less use the soap. This Pears soap is not that strong, but it comes close. I had to take it and wrap the bar up in plastic wrap to get the smell out of my bathroom.Anyone who wants to try Pears glycerin soap, I recommend the amber colored product. It is described as containing thyme and it does have a slight aroma of thyme. I tried this and had no problems with it and the soap leaves your skin feeling very nice and it does not dry your skin."
5,Even better than amber Pears.,"I originally bought this green Pears soap because I like amber Pears and was curious to try this one. My daughter was the first to use it and raved about how much she liked it. I then tried it and had to purchase more so as not to tap into her supply. The best way to describe the smell is clear and clean - and nicer than amber Pears. I hate cloying scents, so this one works well. I would say it is a unisex scent, similar, but not identical, to green tea. I will still purchase the amber Pears, but only if this scent is out of stock. I really wish this green Pears was easier to find. I also have had reactions to some scented soaps, but not this one. The rest of the family enjoys it as well."
2,Total waste of money!,"Do NOT buy this! I bought one and things were fine for about a year & then just as the warranty was up,it started leaking water out of the bottom like crazy! I spent so much time finding this online & ordering it. I really loved the design,features,etc. Very disappointed! The Mr Coffee before that one quit working as well! NO MORE Mr Coffee makers for me!"
2,LEAKY!!!!,I agree with previous review. Have had it for a year and all of a sudden there's water everywhere. Won't buy another one.
1,Stay Away!,"I am on my 2nd one of this coffee maker. it leaks from the bottom, but worst of all the coffee tastes and smells like burning plastic! Has anyone else had this problem? I had the first one replaced by calling customer service at Mr. Coffee but the same problem occured."
2,WATER LEAKS!,"As the other reviewers have mentioned, this coffee maker will leak over time. Our's started leaking after about one year."
1,Leaked on first pot,"Just bought this coffeemaker, and after a successful first rinsing run with just water, set it up to make a pot of coffee. I got a counter covered with coffee. Most of it leaked all over, from where I'm not sure. The few sips that were in the pot tasted terrible."
1,Mine leaks too...,"We've had it just about a year and like the features and design, but like others have said ... all the water leaked out this morning. What a mess. Unfortunately, it's out of warranty. I thought that finally buying a more steeply priced unit would make it better, but I guess not."
2,Great Machine If You Love Cleaning Countertops,"Love the design and it makes a decent cup of coffee. However, be sure to keep plenty of paper towels on hand because this thing can leak like a sieve. It will be my last Mr. Coffee purchase for sure."
1,Ditto,"Just reiterating what everyone else is saying. Tried cleaning it, running water thru it twice, etc. Nothing worked. Disppointed that I have to go out and buy a new coffee maker after 1.5 years."
1,Lipstick on a pig,"We have had two of these coffee makers. The first died a year after purchase. I wrote to them, and they replaced it. The replacement was obviously a reconditioned unit (or possibly a return) as it was poorly packaged. We have had the same issues that other reviewers have noted...leaking, slow brewing. One thing that we find VERY irritating is the beeping. It beeps 3 times when it's done brewing. It beeps when it shuts off. It beeps when it's done cleaning. All of the beeping is annoying! Trust me when I say it WILL wake up the whole house! The adjustable warmer is worthless. We don't want *warm* coffee, and even on the hottest setting, we have to nuke each cup. If you want a pretty coffee maker, this is pretty. If you want a reliable coffee maker that makes hot coffee, quickly and cleanly, don't buy this one."
1,Major LEAKER!!!,"Out-of-the-box, brand-new, it was: filled it with the necessaries and turned it on. Water began flooding our kitchen counter. (At least they provided two view windows to keep tabs on the water level). Nevermore..."
1,Poor quality,"As stated by others, the machine worked well for a year. Now it's leaking all over the place from the bottom. No more Mr. Coffee machines for me."
4,Lovely but...,"I really love the entire concept of this book. It's inspiring and just plain interesting...However, I found it disappointing that not a single page was in color. It would have been nice if even a few had been, specifically ones with photographs or drawings. Plain black and white kind of drains the life out of things...even if many of them are just simple notes."
2,Not that cool,"I found a lot of the stuff in this book lame and not fun to read. Plus its all in black and white and not layed out well at all. The postcard book is much better to read and look at. This book just didnt have it, the letters are random and not entertaining and theres not much to look at..."
2,Needed some cutting,"After seeing the author on ""Late Night with David Letterman"" and hearing some of the excerpts from the book, I thought it seemed like a very interesting concept. However, not every forgotten piece of paper is worth reviewing. Some of the notes and letters included are genuinely funny or poignant. Too many consist of mundane grocery lists, scribbles, and primitive profane diatribes. If someone had weeded out about half of the material, the book would have been memorable. As it is, there is too much trash to sort through to make it worth finding the discarded treasures."
4,Lovely Book,Fascinating collection of detritus. Wish print quality of book was better. Looks like a bad photocopy.Good Content/ Bad Appearance.
4,fun,This book is full of bizarre and funny things. It's put together like a scrapbook. It's a good coffee table book.
2,"Eh, not worth the buy","There were some really good ones, but most were totally boring. Again, read at Barnes & Noble"
3,Funny but really crass/pornographic/filthy at times,"I bought this as a gift for someone who has the same sense of humor as I to enjoy this book but some of the items included were so verbally sexually graphic or violent that I didn't feel like it would really be a good gift--meaning, they couldn't really leave it around where their 8 to 11 year old kids might read it.So, yes this book is funny. A couple times I split my side laughing. No, the humor isn't just wierd, it's also pretty filthy, it has notes liberally peppered with expletives, creative and explicit sexual reference--so if thats's your thing, go for it, but I wouldn't give it to a 15 year old..."
1,foul language and adult humor,"I'll be returning this one. I had read several reviews prior to ordering it, but didn't pick up on the fact that this book is full of foul language and adult humor. I thought there might be a few innuendos, but I wasn't prepared for three of the first few pages I flipped through to have ""F---"" in bold print. I had intended this for a White Elephant gift at a family party, but that's not at all an appropriate audience for this.If you enjoy adult humor and aren't offended by that sort of language, this is probably a funny book. It's just not what I was expecting and not what I want."
1,"Foul, not funny","I wanted to give laughter to my friends, family, and myself at Christmas, and after reading the good reviews on this book, ordered 3 copies: one for friends, one for my sister's family, and one for myself. With great anticipation I opened my copy this morning, only to be horrified with the first page, which repeatedly has the ""F"" word. I am busy writing apologies to my friends and family. It would have been helpful if the review written about the note left on the car would have included the exact wording of that note. I am sure there are some funny stories somewhere in this book, but I do not want to go through trash to find it, and am embarrased that I sent this book to friends and family!!!!"
1,"I'd hate to see ""Dirty Found""","My local radio morning show was raving about this book, so I just had to order it. What they didn't mention was that this book is FULL of the ""F"" word, and many of the notes are very sexually explicit. May be a selling point for some, but not for me. I just received it today, and it's now in the recycle bin. Was going to give it to my husband for Christmas...glad I opened it first!"
5,earth beautification & anthropological observation,"ever since i learned about FOUND magazine i have been recommending it to friends, and even strangers. the book is just like the magazine, only larger and with praise from respected critics, writers and drew barrymore on the back cover... a compliation of many new found items and the best items from past issues of the magazine version. notes, photographs, letters, business cards, keys, a cat... all items lost or discarded that were later collected from all across the world, accompanied by speculations on the object and circumstances of the discovery of the objects, as written by the finders. a collaborative art project with thousands of contributors."
3,Meh.,"Davy Rothbart, Found: The Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotten Items from Around the World (Fireside, 2004)Rothbart speculates, in his preface to Found, that the reason this stuff is so fascinating is that it gives us a glimpse into the lives of strangers and shows us that our feelings are universal. I don't get that, so I'm not approaching the book from the same angle as Rothbart and a number of people he interviews here. I see it more as an interesting artifact of modern archaeology (or sociology), a roster of odd things people felt it important enough to write down, draw, or take pictures of. As such, it's interesting, but ot mandatory; I'm sure I'd get more out of it if I got that emotional connection Rothbart is on about.Still, there's some interesting and/or amusing stuff to be found, no pun intended, in the pages of this volume; needless to say, if you're a fan of the magazine, you're going to love it, but it would also serve as a fine intro to the Found culture. ***"
3,not as good as post secret,"After buying Post Secret, I thought this might be another interesting book. It's ok, but not nearly as good as Post Secret. Most of the book is in black and white, and a lot of the ""finds"" are uninteresting."
2,Not as advertized,"I ordered this one cause it has a nice blue pattern... unfortunately I got another one, titled Marseilles too, but it has nothing compare as it has green and purple flowers and the pattern is kinda girly... The quality is good though but watch out, you won't get the one on the picture!"
1,deceiving advertisement,"I ordered one just a couple of days ago, and got the shipment today, the pattern was totally different, it is called marseilles too, but no blue/gold color at all. I hate to pay shipping to return it, so I guess I have to use it then.. Not happy..."
2,"Not right product, but Amazon was good to work with","As I type this review, the written description is still wrong, but the picture does show the one I received. It is not the one I ordered however. As everyone else has mentioned, the one that was originally pictured was not the one shipped. Amazon took a few days, but they did refund my purchase after I shipped the product back (at their expense), so I wasn't really out anything. Too bad they couldnt' fix the problem because I really wanted the one they originally pictured."
2,What a disappointment!,"This is a cheap made in asia transfer to DVD, certainly not worth the price. Advertised subtittles are not included.I wonder if MGM is aware of that release and if their copyrights were properly protected.I would suggest that Amazon take this item off their catalog.Conclusion: don't get fooled, don't buy!"
4,Very good film!,"This film starring Esther Williams and Victor Mature, is very entertaining, a biography of Annette Kellerman. It os very well done, and well worth seeing."
1,Wish I had read the worst review first!,"Love old Esther Williams movies, and this one is a classic...BUT the quality of the DVD reproduction was awful. It was obviously cheaply produced--perhaps even filmed directly from a movie screen with old ""film streaks and bubbles"", blurry and not the usual DVD features or quality. This was the only DVD listing foor this movie title; if there were another alternative seller for this movie, I'd choose it. If you just want this title anyway, just be forewarned that the quality is very poor."
3,Not a rigorous book!,"This book is good at some aspects but bad in other aspects.The good aspects: the authors try to explain the topics clearly.Bad aspects: there is no proof of theorems in the book. As a result, it is likea high school book. Moreover, some strange mathematics in the book: for example,at page 426, it is written:as N-->\infinity,w0--->dwkw0-->w.This is strange: mathematically if w0--->dw, then kw0-->kdw.As a result, I suggest this book to learn some basics of signals and systems but for a mathematical introduction of the subject this book cannot be used.As a result, the book deserves just 3 stars."
4,"Nice poster, bad shipping!","Poster is nice, but shipping was slow. Took about 2 weeks to receive when I paid for 3-5 day shipping. Not happy considering it was a valentines gift that came too late!"
3,Ten Indian Commandments,"Purchased this item with a poster frame. When the product arrived, there was no frame. Company sent the frame, but it consisted of 2 pieces of the poster frame that didn't even fit a side of the poster; too small! The company issued a refund so I give them a 3 star rating. Had the order been handled properly, I would have gladly rated it higher; Poster Revolution."
2,Face Frame Bits,"This is a very hard to use tool and it doesn't come with any setup instructions. I bought I much more expensive set to use, the set I bought came with setup blocks and detailed instructions."
2,I don't have this set but have used their product,"If you plan on using your router much spend a little more and get a good set. When I received the set I bought one of the two brackets holding the bits in place in the wood box had broken lose and the bits were bouncing around in the box. That is bad for the cutting edge. After about an hours us the 1/4"" straight bit broke. Thankfully Amazon is good about replacing or refunding on defective items."
5,A wonderful book!,"An awesome book, although that shouldn't be a surprise coming from Ravi Zachariah. I found it to be invaluable. If you're prone to approach life from the perspective of intellectual skepticism, then you're familiar with the longings that this book attempts to address. Like C.S. Lewis, Ravi carefully steps up to one of the great voids in life and tries to gently lead you along the path of finding its fulfillment. If you remember a time when life was filled with adventure and hopeful potential, but have found that overshadowed by a pessimism masquerading itself as an empty 'realism,' come with an open mind and go for it! It'll sweep you off your feet!"
4,Recapture The Wonder,"""Recapture The Wonder"" by Ravi Zacharias concerns the issue of having a child-like fascination with God. Christians most likely experienced this early in their walk but have allowed life's concerns and worries rob them of that joy.Among the topics covered include:1. Being passionate about the pursuits that do not offer lasting contentment (sex, power, drugs, career, etc.).2. Different religions and how they approach God.3. Slowing down long enough to spend time thinking about God, His creation, and your relationship with Him.Zacharias challenges the reader to consider that life's concerns are trivial compared to what God thinks and our relationship with Him.Read, enjoy, and be encouraged and challenged.Recommended."
3,Complete Illustrated Guide to Everything Sold in Hardware Stores,"Really good reference. I'm glad I own it, but the day it arrived I found a newer printing at Garden Ridge for $4.OO less than I paid with shipping included."
2,"Decent, 50% of the time","I bought 4 of these. In 2 locations they worked pretty well (however, if you screw the center screw in tight, the swivel covers don't swivel back after the removal of a plug. The result is they are a tad wobbly on the wall). The other 2, did not work at all. The problem is that these are quite deep, and the prongs just didn't make contact in the socket. So depending on how your sockets are installed, they may or may not work. I haven't tried any other brands yet, but I would imagine this being a problem across the board."
1,"Can you say ""sucky"" on here?","I have 4 of these in my house. Each one has 2 outlets (just like a plug). So that makes 8 little gizmos that are supposed to swivel shut when you pull the plug out, right? Out of 8, ONE of them works. So only one half of one cover actually swivels shut when you pull a plug out of it. I didn't even get that they were supposed to close automatically until I saw that this one did. The others we open and shut with the end of a plug, kinda like using a key. So if you close them, they work. But as those of you with kids know, sometimes you can get a little scatter brained and forget. So I always find them open. ALWAYS.I just ordered the kind that slide from side to side. We'll see how those work."
5,Works well for me,"These were recommended to me by my sister in law and we decided to use them in my sons bedroom. I have never had a problem with them being used! We installed them right after painting his room when waiting for him to be born and now that he is almost 3 they are still working great. I use my sons outlet to vacuum upstairs and our Dyson's plug never had any trouble fitting- and his lamp and monitor all plugged in well. Worth a try, see if they fit your needs because if they do- they're amazing."
2,big plugs don't fit inside cutout,"Fine for small sized plugs, but our vacuum cleaner plug doesn't fit inside the cutout and stays wobbly when I'm vacuuming the hallway. I'm going with the sliding plate covers from now on; they're also spring-loaded but have the plug holes flush with the plate cover."
4,Much loved and moved into each house,"We have moved 4 times since having babies and I go through the house and repeatedly replace these outlet covers each move because I can't bear to live without them. I read the other reviews and you do have to be careful with installation. If they are too tight to the wall it will stick open and not spring shut like they should. I like the look of them better than regular outlet covers. And I have always had single screw mounting and never had a problem. My only gripe is that for the larger plugs, like my timer, the outlet does not let them in far enough to stay working. So we have a few choice spots in the house that we use the traditional plastic plug-ins"
2,good product,"I had to buy these for my dacare as the state says that the 'plugs' are unsafe. I perosnally think it is a waste of money. when i plug something in it does not stay in that great as their is too much space. Plus it sticks out of the wall a bit so before my kids never noticed the plugs, and now they are always their trying to put things in the holes and try turning it. i think if you do not have to buy them, then stick with the plugs, they work better and are a lot cheaper."
2,Detached Spring,I have the same problem as another reviewer - detached spring. I took a picture of the outlet cover and highlighted the detached spring.
5,My Zune is now safe!,"The product I got was very nice and came with the added arm band and most impotantly, the screen protector, some screen protectors tend to be bubbly or distorted but this on almost even seemes to improve the screen, great product that also got here on time.Adam Guthrie"
2,Expected a little more,For the price it was great in the beginning. It stretches easy and dislodges the headset at times. the armband lost it's hold and the Zune flops around with use.
3,I think it would be good...,if I could get the damn thing open! I've had several people try to help me open up the case in order to see if it actually works. Still can't open it up. >:(
1,Beautiful??,"I have to agree with the ""moron"" who reviewed this inferior production.Read Sherif's own comments and you will sense his self-consciousness, inferiority complex, and attempt to defend something that is the antithesis of beauty and art. I bought this DVD on a lark and after one viewing, found it most useful as a frisbee or a coaster for my coffee table."
1,Anything But Relaxing!,"I have enjoyed several ""relaxing"" DVD's featuring ocean waves and beaches in Hawaii and around the world with stunning photography and appropriate meditative music. This version, with its uneven, jerky photographic techniques, reminds me of the videos I took just after purchasing my first camcorder years ago. Whoever produced this must have also just purchased his/her first video camera. The music is poorly chosen, sounding more like something the college guys edited in after their fraternity break in Hawaii. I am an amateur photographer and could have done much better. I will try to return this disc to the Amazon Marketplace seller as soon as possible. Please do not waste your money!"
2,Just a bunch of pictures,and none i haven't seen elsewhere in my other DIY garden project books. I was NOT inspired.
5,"Magnuson shows that books, like, kick-bum!!!","I just got done reading the paperback version of this book and it's a hoot. Highly recommended. In short, it's a hilarious (and often melancholy) autobiography about the author who's a classic underachiever, drifting through life by drinking, (trying) to get laid and playing the drums. When that doesn't work out, he goes back to college and gets an english lit. degree. In the end, Magnuson finally finds his place in the world through self-acceptance and love. It's also a very pointed critique of those (your basic ""politically correct"" types) who engage in the very same stereotyping (this time - of the male lummox) that the lummox is so often accused of doing. Like Jim Goad's ""Redneck Manifesto,"" the moral of the story may well be that stereotyping is inaccurate, and therefore dangerous, whether it comes from the left or the right.And if that doesn't pique your interest in reading this book, then read it because, to use Magnuson's words, it ""kicks bum!"""
4,"Because We Can, That's Why!","The Wispelwey performance of the three Britten suites for cello is up to and beyond his usual high standards. It's a shame that we in the U.S. haven't heard more of Wispelwey's recordings -- or more than just the usual, standard fare from the Britten repertoire. That alone makes this recording one to purchase and savor. My one beef with this Channel Classics hybrid, multi-channel SACD is that a multi-channel recording of a solo performance truly begs the question of ""WHY?"" Don't get me wrong, the recording is very well done, as are all of Channel's SACDs, but a stereo SACD recording would really have done the job here. Just my opinion, though -- I'd welcome any other input from other classical music lovers."
4,Great product,"I love this CD player...except the headphones are jumpy at times...staticy like. Depends if you hit them or something...the radio reception is great, clear sounding. The CD player is awesome! It has a great sound. In my opinion, this is a great product!"
1,"Low price, low quality",Radio reception is poor at best (and I live in the NY Metro area). Have had problems with CD playback when it comes to playing the middle to end tracks (could just be my unit). Why do most walkman or cd players continue to come with these awfull headphones? Can't they give us consumers a break. Most people will go out and spend anywhere from $20 to $50 on new headphones to replace the garbage ones that come with the units.
1,just plain horible....,"im telling u ppl, dont buy this system. the anti-skip sucks. it wont even play a cd. i have to go out and buy more batteries and still, nothin. and when it does work, it shuts off in the middle of the song and then...nothing. well, at least hank god for am/fm."
4,An amazing toy,"I've always had problems with watches keeping the right time. Even quartz watches seem to somehow slip a few minutes with me, and I never really trust the things. So when I saw this, I had to check it out. I figured, how bad could it be? If I hated it, I'd return it. I'm not going to return it. I love this thing. The face is attractive, the steel mesh band is comfortable and the functionality is amazing. My only problem is that I had a little trouble setting the time zone. It was too late to call tech support (toll free number included) but after fiddling with it a few minutes more, it sprang to life and reset itself. Since it receives a signal every night at 1am to set the exact time, I don't ever have to worry about being a few minutes off. When dealing with commuter train schedules, this can (and has) saved my day."
1,Chinsey build,"This USB key has a chinsey plastic build. The outer case that protects and holds the inner flash drive is a very thin plastic with only a loose grip on the flash unit inside. As a result, the memory can easily pop out.Also, the encryption utility gave me errors right after installing it. I downloaded the updated version and installed - but it apparently doesn't use the same included license key. So now I have a cheaply built flash drive that I can't encrypt until support resolves the license issue.Finally, the reseller did not include a retail box, but rather a plastic bag with the parts inside - looking very much like an OEM package or bulk purchase that was separated."
5,Wet? Buy this album!,"This is one of my most favorite rainy day albums of all time. And I live in Seattle, so there is quite a few of them. Equipped with this and other Rachel's CDs, a good book, and a huge cup of coffee all I have to say is, Bring it on La Niña! Some songs have a sound that is the audio equivalent of a mouth full of angle food cake, walking around a moldy, wet, raining garden with PJ Harvey. I really don't have anything to back that up, its just what comes to mind when I listen to this CD. I think that's the ultimate beauty of lyricless music - you can interpret it for your self. ""His Eyes"" has got to be one of the most beautiful tracks I have ever heard. Those eyes must be very impressive."
4,Really good,The format is a little akward but it does the job in providing exiting vegan dishes. Vegan dishes should have more pics since many of us a trying to go vegan or increase our plant consumption.
4,Nice book,"The New Vegan Cookbook is a nice cookbook with plenty of color photographs. Just a warning, though, I would not recommend it specifically for ""new"" vegans (the new in the title refers to nouveau cuisine type new rather than beginning) unless they are already cooks. I love Lorna Sass's books but found this one a bit more complicated than some of the others and more likely to require expensive/exotic ingredients. I would recommend her book ""Short cut vegetarian"" for new/beginning cooks or those who are looking for simpler recipes.I honestly see this more as a cookbook that you would give as a gift rather than use regularly in the kitchen - it's compact and aesthetically appealing. For myself, I would have liked to see more recipes and fewer graphic frills...but there is only so much that you can get into a book of this size."
5,Creative Interesting Food,"I am a vegan and my (domestic) partner is not. This cookbook has given us enough wonderful vegan recipes to keep him from killing me. I only wish that it were longer. Of particular note are the stuffed eggplants and the roasted sweet potato corn chowder.

5,Excellent,Best cable i've ever bought for the price. Would of cost $35+ at a best-buy. Excellent quality. i suggest this to anyone looking for an ethernet cable
4,Inxpensive Ethernet Cable,I purchased the cable to connect an additional device to my router. The cable was inexpensive and arrived as promised. The connectors have additional plastic that prevent the locking tabs from being accidentally broken off.
4,Exactly what I needed,"The cable works perfectly. I bought it to hook up Netflix streaming on my blu ray player and the picture quality is superb. Great price, great product!"
2,Not for handling.,"I have had this cable for a couple months now, it has been working fine. But I use it to connect my laptop to the internet because wireless is so terrible around here. After multiple plug-ins and unplugs, the little knob that clicks the cable into place broke off. So I simply switched the cable around and a few weeks later BAM, same thing. Now the cable is basically useless because if keeps coming out of the port. If you were simply going to plug this in once and forget about it, it's totally worth the money, but if you need something more solid and reliable, buy something else."
3,Functional and inexpensive but not durable,"Worked out of the box with no issues.However, I am using with a laptop that I move around sometimes.The connector is not very strong or molded and is cracking within months.This cable is fine for light duty use."
4,Good,Great Price. Item was exactly what was ordered. Received in a good time. Still working. Would recommend. Would use again.
4,cable,was exactly what i needed and was just like it was pictured. good buy and a great price .will buy again
2,connector defect,It is a working ethernet cable. It is white and 25 feet long. One of the connectors is out of spec and does not click lock in to my computer. Other cables do.
3,"Good product, not exactly what I ordered","The cable is fine but I wouldn't have specifically ordered a white one if that wasn't what I wanted. I got a very dark gray, which sticks out like a sore thumb running down the white wall! Good product but you should really pay more attention to specific details, next time I'll order from someone who is hopefully not color blind!!Ethernet Cable, CAT5e - 25 ft White"
2,Ethernet Cable CAT5e-25 ft White,This is a really nice Ethernet cord BUT it kinda sucks. I have to remove it and plug it back in a few times every time I want to use it. I am positive that it isn't my laptop that is messed up because I have other Ethernet cables that work just fine without having to connect and disconnect the cable various times. It is very frustrating.On a 1-5 scalelooks: 5utility: 2.5
1,Bad connectors,"The connectors on this cable get stuck in the ethernet input jacks on all my laptops. If you want to damage your laptop by trying to force this cable out of it, buy this cable, otherwise, stay away. Horrible item. There should be negative stars for a product like this."
2,Nearly impossible to unplug,"You need a cable that you will never unplug? This cable is for you otherwise buy something else.However, it took me about 20 minutes to take off the cable, I couldn't take it off so I managed to cut it.Two stars because at least it works."
1,This cable is NOT white!,"This cable is a dark creme color, it is NOT white, if you want a WHITE cable look elsewhere, with this you will be getting a tan-ish off white."
2,Not very durable,"I've had the same problem reported by a few others with this cable- after a few months of use, the clip holding the cable in place weakened and eventually broke off. If you're just using the cable in a plug and forget sort of application it works fine, but if it's going to be unplugged and replugged fairly regularly then you'll probably have a problem."
2,Don't bother if you're short,This doesn't work if you're short given the fact that you can't bend this thing right since you're center or core is different from taller folks.
1,Worthless junk,There are significantly better options available. This is a rickety and flimsy piece of equipment that breaks easily.
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I rented this movie for our 4-year-old daughter and was pleasantly surprised. This movie talks a little bit about adoption, which is a topic that is near and dear to my heart since my daughter is adopted. It explains adoption in such a sweet and gentle way with quotes such as, ""We all need to be with the ones who love us the best."" I have now purchased this movie for my daughter and plan to watch it with her from time-to-time for the next couple of years as one way to help me explain adoption to her in a very kid-friendly way."
3,movie,received in very good condition. Slightly different than the miss spider t.v. show on Nick jr.
3,too scary for small tykes,"Cute idea, but a little disjointed and it terrified my 2 yr old. By the fourth time she saw Spideras she was crying to turn it off, and she doesn't usually get scared. She asks to see the spiders in Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. The snakes really scared her as well. And she hated the idea of losing a mommy - she wouldn't let me out of her sight all evening. Even though we watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang right afterward, she was talking about scary monsters when she woke up in the morning."
1,Too Scary!,"After seeing the trailer on another DVD, my three year old graddaughter asked if we could get this movie. I ordered it for Easter and she watched it that night. It was absolutely terrifying. She started to cry and and scream ""turn it off, Grammy!"" Of course we felt horrible. The trailer looks very cute but there is a very big, white, ugly spider who is oviously ""bad"" and has huge pointed teeth in a blood red mouth. Really in poor taste for little ones! We pitched into the garbage where it belongs!"
2,Screams of terror,"I think this movie is for older children. I am a mother of a 14 month old and was just looking for something different, I have seen Nemo and Toy Story till I am quoting. When my daughter took one look at Spidarious she screamed in terror, it was really sad. I think he is scary also and the lady spider he falls for in the end looks like the Devil. The beginning of it was a turn off because of Spidarious but it did get better however I did think he was a bit evil for a children's film."
2,too scary,"The antagonist in this movie is a very scary looking ghost-white spider with a big human-like face, a huge chin and sharp white teeth contrasting against a blood red mouth. He made me raise my eyebrows just before sending my three year old screaming and running from the TV. He shows up in the background in the initial wedding scene, when Miss Spider is getting married, muttering something about why isn't she with him; odd content for a young audience. Then he shows up mouth wide open ready to gobble one of Miss Spider's eggs that was dropped from a branch on the way to the egg sack. The egg does get rescued by some flying bug in the knick of time. We just stopped watching the movie after this point. We won't be watching it again until I know which scenes to skip a priori."
4,"The Story, The Colors, The Bugs!","My 3-year-old twins love this story (so do I), relating closely to the idea that everyone/everything has a home where it belongs. The variety of bug life in this movie, the bright primary colors, and the ""humanity"" of the creatures in this show (even Scary Spiderus wants to find someone to belong with, and wouldn't it be the best if we all looked out for each other like those bugs?) has influenced my kids to react differently to the crawlers around our home. Before Sunny Patch their automatic reaction to bugs was ""Mommy I'm scared!"" Now they want to know where the bug lives and why it isn't at home. Another step towards tolerating and welcoming diversity, from the world of bugs."
3,Hesitant to try again,I had been getting this product throught the Subscribe and Save program but cancelled due to a bad batch. The popcorn tasted stale and would burn in one small spot and ruin the whole bag. Not sure if it was a storage problem or quality control.Amazon was great in crediting my account for the bad batch but I am hesitant to try it again.
4,"Better than Earwig, but it's no Strong Reaction","This album is MUCH better than Earwig, but nothing they do will EVER match the intensity and feeling of Strong Reaction/Three Chord Monte. They still have that annoying ""sound"" they picked up after ""Fore"". In my opinion, that ""sound"" is ... (huge) reverb on the drum kit (come on, for a punk band? you're kidding me...)."
3,Good punk rock but there's still better stuff out there.,"I haven't listened to any other Pegboy albums. Since this one is the first I buy, the impression that they give me is that these 4 guys know what they are doing. They have been a long time down the road so Cha Cha Damore sounds much more mature than other punk rock bands around. This stuff is pure punk rock full of rythmn and nice cord riffs. The lyrics are nice and the lead singer has a good strong voice for punk rock singing, instead of an annoying voice like the vocals on bands such as Lagwagon and NOFX. In this album sometimes the songs lack melody and speed. Best song all around and worth while buying the album for is track #1 Dangerwood. Track # 4 Dangermare follows the same path. Track #10 Surrender is a little slower but still good. 3 stars, no more no less."
1,"So bad, I could not believe I bought it","I bought this years ago, but for some reason Amazon never forgets. This CD was so awful I thought it was mislabled. Nope. I got confused on which band this was, and ordered the CD. Now days I would give it a listen on iTunes first, so that I would not make a mistake like this again. This was really awful music."
3,disappointed,"I absolutely adore the music making of Jordi Savall. He manages to put a richness and life into ancient music that is hard to find. So I was very disappointed to discover that the music in these discs does not have that richness and life I associate with his other work. I don't know why, but I simply have been unable to connect with these pieces. It's not that the music or the performance is bad. Maybe it's the recording (I especially miss the deep resonant drums). Whatever it is, it just sounds like run of the mill ancient music. Uninspiring. Good for little more than background music to a boring documentary about medieval Spain or something. Okay, maybe it's a little better than that. But this is definitely a case of getting what you pay for."
5,FANTASTIC,"I think this product is great, I bought it for my daughter for her birhtday and now I think I want one myself it is so cute, my daughter loves it she is always listening to music, the sound quality is great the radio comes in perfect and it never breaks I love it so don't hesitate too buy it is great."
4,Our Day Will Come,"Ruby was one great singer; that song brought back memories of the Chalypso, and was one of the few songs out there that you Could Chalypso to. Loved it then! and now!"
3,Ruby and The Romantics..Best Of?,"Missing are ""Stranger On The Shore"" and ""Lonely People Do Foolish Things"" among others."
4,Hurting Each Other/Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore,"All I want to know is: will the Feb.23, 2003 RUBY & THE ROMANTICS Cd anthology also include RUBY's original[but very obscure]versions of that monster CARPENTER'S 1972 hit single, 'HURTING EACH OTHER' and also the Carpenters revival of 'YOUR BABY DOESN'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE' from 1983 cd-album, which was issued shortly after KAREN's passing? Richard wrote in the liner notes for the cd version of A SONG FOR YOU(Carpenters-1972) they covered HURTING EACH OTHER(#2 chart gold single), with a completely different arrangement than RUBY & CO.'s bossa-nova version. I'd love to hear the original versions of those two songs, though better known by the Carpenters."
3,Not for the raw beginner,"Finding it an easier read than others I have thumbed through. This is not for the raw newbie to programming though. If you've never coded before - go get a beginner book on Javascript or something. Wish there were less command line examples. Who enjoys that? If you are not smart enough to download a decent tool, I really don't want you coding my system..."
5,Excellent Book,This the best book I ever seen on PL/SQL programming. It is good for beginners as well as for experience programmer for reference. Book layout is also good.
2,O'Reilly Oracle books,"I started learning Oracle over a week ago and started with Learning PL/SQL which started out good but it was hard to follow. I have the Oracle PL/SQL book out of the library and I also as finding it hard to follow; the material is disorganized...In addition, you can download some examples from O'Reilly but they are not complete or incorrect (or even helpful). Some of the examples have not been touched in a long time but I do not believe anyone reviewed the code...I would recommend the book, Oracle Database 11g SQL by Jason Price, as a much better alternative to this book. The book is methodical in its approach in teaching Oracle..."
1,Offensive on every level,"Feuerstein can't seem to resist lacing this programmer book with their views on religion government, and politics and I'm beyond offended by Feuerstein's published trash about being ashamed to be an American and going off about his Jewish heritage. Who Cares? Not me, and I paid good money for this drivel. The content of the book by itself is only so so but when you add the offensive examples by a truely disgraceful man and Feuerstein injection of politics into an Oracle book I felt sick."
2,Not for the beginner,"While I'm sure this book will be a great reference in the future, it assumed that I knew more than I did. I purchased this book because of the reviews of being good for the beginner. Rather disappointed with the reference to concepts to be reviewed in future chapters which kept me confused."
5,great,"this is some great deathcore. amazing drumming, chugging breakdowns, gutoral screams that will make your skin crawl. for fans or all shall perish, as blood runs black, job for a cowboy etc..."
2,Not worth the trouble to find,"2 1/2With dated composition and production, this meandering though short, funked-up, world fusion hippie project from the epic soundtrack designer validates why some of his own projects never felt as assured as some of his scoring. Though you can't fault him for trying, many tracks strain for natural power but end up feeling powerfully strained instead."
5,Nana Mouskouri's debut album in the United States,"This album originally entitled ""The Girl From Greece Sings"" was recorded in 1962 when Nana Mouskouri was almost twenty-eight years old and represents her debut in the United States. Although not a true jazz singer, Nana Mouskouri under the able direction of Quincy Jones uses her beautiful voice to deliver excellent renditions of fifteen well known jazz classics including; 'No Moon At All', 'Thats My Desire', 'Love Me or Leave Me', 'Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me', 'What Now My Love' and 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes'. Nana manages to project emotion through some of these songs, especially in her rendition of 'What Now My Love'. Although I do not listen to much jazz, I enjoyed listening to this CD."
3,Keep an Eye on the Battery,"After only two years, the battery cracked, destroying the unit, but thankfully not any property.Otherwise, it did as it was supposed to, although I never could get it to silence power outage alarms even though the software said that was set."
5,A classic tale,I watched The Razor's Edge on the recommendation of a friend - and he was right to recommend it! What an interesting tale. I found my opinion of some of the characters change some over the course of the story which only goes to show you the depth of the characterizations. Also the story gives you much to think about. I enjoyed it tremendously!
1,"Lousy sound! Doesn't function in ""upright"" position.","I ordered this because of the ""flat panel"" design. Little did I know that you have to lay it flat to operate it. Defeats the purpose! Then, to add insult to injury, the sound that emerged from the speakers was tinny ... sounded like a cheap kid's MONO cassette player ... not a stereo boom box! The controls are user-UNfriendly, too. ..."
5,"Dig Man, There Goes Elmore James...","One of the best slide players of all time, if not the best, listening to Elmore James is the blues all rolled up in one with intense, energized electricity. No other bluesman could put forth so much energy into every song and lyric, James is also one of the better vocalist in the genre. These are ""the early years"" recordings of Elmore James, not complete, still generously loaded with twenty eight of his best songs on one disc, imported from the UK, the Ace company. I chose this disc and ""The Best Of The Fire Sessions"" to avoid the alternate takes on the complete box sets, it's also a cheaper route, basically you get the best Elmore James cuts spanning his entire career, early and later recordings. I'm sure there's alot of good James material left to be heard on the box sets, the best of compilations are good enough for me. The audio is excellent on the early sides, and even better on the Fire Sessions. The distinctive sound of Elmore James."
5,The Best Toy Ever,"I got this toy the other day for 13th b-day,and I LOVE THIS TOY!!!! I am a HUGE fan of the movie,and I am quite pleased to have this in my collection of Nightmare Before Christmas tings."
1,Horrible me engañaron,"No es Original el combo, solo el forro, lo demas es todo generico, tengan cuidado."
2,Whose footprint?,"Compared to the excellent Lonely Planet guide and even the rough guide, the Footprint book on Cambodia leaves much to be desired... it is full of errors of history and fact, and even gives wrong coordinates on its maps, especially its important map of Phnom Penh. If you buy one guidebook to Cambodia, let it be Lonely Planet, not this very disappointing Footprint guide, no matter how pretty the pictures are.D.G. Longmuirformer Canadian Ambassador to Cambodia"
5,Shining Like the Son: The Best of Bob Rice,If you have never heard of Bob Rice you are missing a very exciting singer of Christian music. If you are familiar with Christian music you should be very familiar with Bob Rice. I own several Bob Rice music CDs and all are excellent. Do yourself a very big favor and buy this CD as I know you will enjoy it very much.
2,Deceptive Packaging,"I bet I'm not the only one who was fooled into thinking this book was a work of fiction. The cover art looks just like Hillerman's best selling novels. I liked the lead story, ""The Great Taos Bank Robbery"", but the rest were only mildly interesting. Not worth the price of admission."
3,Vintage Tony Hillerman,"I purchased this after hearing Tony read a few passages at a lecture. The book is a series of essays Tony wrote as his Masters Thesis at the University of New Mexico. They are true tales of New Mexico, but told only as Tony, one of America's greatest yarn spinners can. Most, in particular the ""unfeloneous unbankrobbery"" in the title essay will have you holding your sides, while at the same time learning something about the unique culture of the Land of Enchantment. Highly recommended as well is Tony's autobiography ""Seldom Disappointed""."
4,Get with Reality,"If you have spent ANY time in New Mexico (or a lifetime like me), there is a Favor & Life Style here that is Unique. With the Modern World slithering in & changing everything, this book is a Wonderful Testament to the way things used to be. If you are here for any length of time you may still experience some of the conditions & Personalities described, but like the Roswell Aliens, they can be difficult to find. If you have no sense of Humor, don't read this-try the daily paper."
5,",He Da Man","Hillerman is a great writer and having once lived in New Mexico, his writings bring back fond memories for me"
4,Kenney,Kenny is a great country singer and his latest album was filled with some pretty amazing songs. I really think that this album is what made Kenny go over the top is stardom becasue before this CD i didnt really listen to Kenny a hole lot. However now i have got a few of his other CD AND i love him. He has great talent and its also a plus that his best friend is my all time favorite country singer TIM MCGRAW NOW he has talent. Both of them are such talented men. I am so proud to say that i am there fans.
5,Great stuff,Kenny has some fun on this Album. He colaberates with Uncle Craker. Makes you long for some fun in the sun. Not to mention going on vacation inthe islands where he's been.
5,TOTALLY AWESOME!,"This CD has ABSOLUTELY NO SONGS I DON'T LIKE! I bought it for the Good Stuff, but I have to say that I listen to it over and over, because all the songs are SO GOOD!! BUY IT!"
5,purely exceptional,"This is the best album i have bought in a long, long time.There is not a bad song on this c.d. My favorites-1- Young- a good song that has hit written all over it 5/52. a lot of things different- sensational 5/53- on the coast of somewhere beautiful- this song makes you feellike your on some island. 5/54- dreams - excellent melody and good message- 5/55- one step up- wonderful cover of bruce springsteen's song 5/56-I can't go there- i love the song and it really work's with the guest vocals of tim mcgraw. 5/57- Big star- good upbeat tune about what can happen if you work hard for your dreams. 5/58- the good stuff- a wonderful and special song 5/5These are my favorites but the other 4 songs are just as good.Whether you are a traditionalist or a newcomer to country you will want to get this album."
5,Kenny's Best,"This is definately the best CD Kenny Chesney has come out with so far. All the songs are so personal to him, which makes the whole CD great to listen to. I pop this in my car and listen to it over and over while I'm driving. It's a CD that you'll never get sick of. It has the perfect mix of everything - The rock sound, the country sound, and even some pop sounds. I would definately recommend this CD for anyone looking for uplifting awesome country music!"
3,Not too bad!,"I will start by saying this is a good CD. My only reservation is that his songs are all starting to sound the same. He sings a lot of love songs and songs about broken hearts. I like it better when he does his lighthearted songs. I would also like to see him sing some different notes. His voice has become a little boring and monotnous. Overall, this is a good album, but not great!"
1,Big disappointment,"Sorry, I've been a Kenny Chesney fan since his first album, but I just couldn't get into this one. I found the songs mediocre, the words trite, and there wasn't anything on the album that made me go ""wow"". All his previous albums I've loved. But then again, I've found that the majority of albums this last year have been pretty mediocre in the country genre. Hope 2003 brings better music to us all."
5,SO GOOD!,"I fell in love with so many of the singles off this disk that I finally broke down and purchased it! And, I have to say, that aside from one song which I consider a ""dud,"" the disk is great! (my dud is #3, ""A Lot of Things Different"")His music varies throughout the CD, so you don't feel like you're listening to the same song over and over. Also, he has a bit of Jimmy Buffet in him, which is really fun to listen to! His ballads are sweet and his more rock-style stuff is energetic and well put together. This is a solid effort! A+"
1,Only one good song,"I bought this album because I loved the title song. It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album be, right? Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the Nashville music scene. He's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town. I'll get down off my soapbox now. But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and stop this pop nonsense. What country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things."
5,Kenny's best work so far...,"I love this cd. I fell in love with Kenny Chesney's music back in 1999 when ""Everywhere We Go"" was released. That particular cd was my soundtrack for a road trip through Oregon. I had just had my heart broken and that cd was the only thing that helped. Since I bought ""No Shoes No Shirt No Problems"" I've been listening to it daily. My mother died from cancer back in January and of ""The Good Stuff"" never fails to make me cry. I'm a sucker for sad ballads so of course my absolute favorite song is ""I Can't Go There"". There isn't anything I don't love about this cd. I'm a big Jimmy Buffett fan and I get the feeling that Kenny is too. Buy this cd, you won't regret it."
5,"This CD is filled with all the ""Good Stuff""","This CD is amazing. The lyrics are incredible and Kenny just brings them to life. I've been going through some really tough times recently and it seems like he just reached inside my heart to sing ""I remember"", ""One Step Up"", and ""I Can't Go There"". I could not ask for a greater CD. Every single song on here I love. It's great."
5,Another EXCELLENT job by Kenny!!,"This CD is absolutely great. My fave song is ""Dreams"", although I really like ""A lot of things different"". Kenny continuously provides us with excellent country music and in my opinion, he can't release new CDs often enough. He will soon top Country music as one of the best ever if not THE best. I recommend this CD to anyone who is a country music fan. Great music!!"
5,Thanks Kenny!,"Even if you're not a big country fan, you can appreciate Kenny. Some of his lyrics and reminising remind me of John Mellencamp, the Cougar days. ( and if you see Kenny, he does a great cover of Jack and Diane!) It's a great CD, and I can see where he's matured, not only in voice but in the songs he wrote and chose. Thanks Kenny, ""you get better all the time."" ( borrowed that from a friend of Kenny's)"
5,Well worth it!,"All and all this is a good album. I personally enjoy ""Young"", ""Live Those Songs"" and ""Big Star"" because I am a fan of fast and up-beat tunes. Other good tracks include the title track, ""No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems"" and "" I Remember."" The only disappointment I have with this album is that I had an expectation of a ""duet"" with Tim McGraw, but he only sang on the song ""I Can't Go There"" for a few seconds. Dispite my one complaint, Kenny adds sure-hits to his already illustrious career. Good Job Kenny!"
5,Wheatgrass seed,"The wheatgrass seed arrived on time, as promised. I have grown two batches of it now and it has an incredibly high sprouting level. All of the seeds sprouted and grew. It's also hardier than some seeds I've tried, lasting almost 3X as long in the pot. Excellent product, excellent service."
4,Cats enjoy it!,"I was looking for a xmas gift for our cats and saw this. A packet of seeds and some directions, which are written for those wishing to grow the wheatgrass for personal consumption (juiced), but in an enterprising move they also suggest this item for cats. My only complaint is that for the cost of the item there doesn't seem to be a lot of seed - maybe this is great for someone to try it out, but if I were planning on doing this for myself on a daily basis would want to find perhaps a larger quantity."
4,The grass is green.,The grass seeds germinate very well. Directions for growth and care are sufficient to provide a supply of much needed grass.
4,Great product,The package is small for the price if you drink wheat grass often. They should mention this is only 15 grams instead of labeling it as 400 seeds.
2,Very tiny amount!,"With no prior knowledge of wheatgrass, I was shocked to find just how few seeds this equates to! It would barely be enough to cover a tiny pot's surface! Not at all what I thought I was getting. And unlike what others have mentioned in their reviews, I got no growing instructions whatsoever! This is not for the wheatgrass novice!"
3,Good quality seeds but don't be fooled by the seed count,"400 seeds will yield about 1/4 of an oz. of twitgrass juice. Fine for someone who wants to see if juicing is for them but I was a little thrown off how small the amount was. Either way, the seeds grew perfectly."
2,This is not 400 seeds,"I feel that I got ripped off . The number of wheatgrass seeds are said to be 400, but in reality it seems less than 200. And before anybody says anyhting, no I didn't actually count all the seeds in the little pouch. However, the amount of seeds in this small packet could barely fill up a 1/4 a cup. Its more than likely to fill 1/8 a cup and I don't even think people make measuring cups that small. So hopefully you can see my frustration, for the price and the wait you should just buy a bulk of wheatgrass and call it a day"
4,Wheatgrass,"These seem to be very good quality seeds, they started coming up after only 3 days. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I highly doubt there was 400 seeds in that little bag, there's no way."
4,Solid performance,"This is a great CD / Mixer - very reliable, reads and starts playing CDs VERY quickly. My only complaint is that the CD drives do NOT have anti-skip. If someone bumps the table, or, if you have the bass turned up too loud and the speakers are touching the table, it will skip. But if you can place this unit in an area where it's not going to be bumped, it will serve you well. I also appreciate the assorted inputs, so I can connect my computer or MP3 player, turn-tables, and wireless mics. This is a great unit if you're a mobile DJ, dance instructor, dance or exercise studio, etc. I've hooked it up to powered speakers and through amplified sound systems, and it sounds very professional."
1,Dissapointed,"When I received this product from amazon one day early I was pleased. When I opened the package the box the parts came in was in rough condition, with a big sticker that stated ""kit is not returnable if plastic sleeve is opened"". I opened the box there was no plastic sleeve and every part was opened. I realize I attempting to get my auto parts at a discount but this is ridiculous."
4,Nice unit but not quite as described,"For the price, it is a nice enough unit. Two problems in the description - tone is only a switch as previously mentioned. There is also no Mike input jack."
1,Piece of Junk!,I wish there was a no star rating because that is exactly what this product deserves! The item was completely broken!! The CD player on it did not work and the cables that connect the speakers had been cut! I was completely unsatisfied with the product! It was the biggest piece of junk I have ever wasted my money on!
4,Versatile and durable for music fans on a budget,"This is a surprisingly decent little piece of sound equipment. The system is light and compact, but puts out a good bit of volume. Dials and buttons are all clear and accessible, and the remote works from a good distance away. The sound quality isn't ideal, but for the price it can't be beat. Good for dorm rooms or small office spaces."
4,bettter than path of resistance,this is fairly impressive from these ex-earth crisis members.not another EC sound alike but new original matterial.fresh and interesting music.I bought it for hoods buti now prefer freya more!
4,Stormy Vigil,"I enjoyed this book. Most of the action transpires on a windswept lighthouse island and features an intrepid magazine reporter and a handsome, introverted professor/writer. Excellent writing style that made me feel I was right there on the lighthouse island with them. Interesting story, too."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"The product itself is made of quality materials, it is flexible enough, you can tell all that from the touch and the feel of the cable. :) I am sure it will serve for years, but I just cannot use it yet...Most of the KVMs I've seen use male/male VGA cables (SXGA, if you want) and that's what I need. However this cable is ""male DB15 + USB type A"" / ""female DB15 + USB type B"" cable. Due to lack of description or good pictures I fooled myself into believing this is what I need. Now that I know what it is I can tell the same from the picture. I give it only *** because description/pictures really could be better.Now I am shopping for male/male DB15 adapter; simply not happy..."
3,good but not great,I bought the DE to replace a similar one I got from the Sharper Image (no longer in business) 5 years ago. In comparison two things I don't like about the D E: the highest tension setting is only moderate; also the pedals are great for hand gripping but hard to keep one's feet on.
4,Ouled El Bahdja,"Hello, I just wanted to let everybody know that this is an Algerian band not french like the description shows it!Thanks"
4,Clear insights,"This is a book for people who want clear, gem-like insights into the art of personal transformation. I enjoyed the concise writing style and the direct appeal to the reader's innate sense of wholeness.The author speaks to the psychological as well as the spiritual aspects of wholeness and the need to approach life with attention to the mulit-leveled nature of every individual. It is one of those books that you can open anywhere and find something that brings wisdom to your present situation."
1,Shipping a defective product,"Product as shipped was defective, according to the product's manufacturer. the product was shipped without any contact information or return procedures provided. I was required to directly contact the product's manufacturer, and Amazon's customer service inorder to get the supplier information I needed to claim a refund."
1,Terrible and cheap,"I bought two of these items, and one of them is already dead! They are cheap and work horrible! The get confused, the buttons are hard to press, and they stop working after about a month!! DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,Ipod Shuffle Clone,"If you really don't care about sound quality or performance, and have a Mac OS, then buy this. Other uses for this product:1. Paperweight - after the polymer lithium battery dies on you in a few months. Not only that, the battery is only rated at 9 hours. Real world tests probably give it five.2. Secret Santa - your coworkers or friends will think of you spent a fortune on an Ipod Shuffle. However, upon closer examination, they will want their bottle of Vodka back."
3,"Well,","It worked great for about 8-9 months, but then the usb drive started to wear out. Now, to charge or upload songs I have to hold it a certain way in my usb drive. This may have been because of improper usb handling, or just that the product wears out easily. I was highly dissapointed that it happened, but other than that, i love the thing. Much cheaper than an ipod too!"
1,Buckeye Spirit? Looks Gross to Me,"I bought this video expecting to see some sweet Buckeye tailgate tradition, but the only thing on the tape was a bunch of guys in Ohio State jerseys making out with one another while Seal's ""Kiss From a Rose"" played softly in the background. It went on for almost two hours. Quite disturbing.My advice? Save the $16, go to a greater Columbus-area pub, and buy four appletinis. In the time it takes you to sip down a few of Ohio's favorite alcoholic beverage, you'll see plenty more guys in Ohio State jerseys making out with one another, and you'll get a nice buzz.The video is accurate, just lacks creativity. If you're into this sort of thing, go for it. GO BUCKS!"
3,Change in Formula,"This is a good product. Having severe allergies to most hair products I was pleased that Le Remouver worked for me, that is before the shampoo became almost nothing but goo. It is so thick with grease that it does not work as well as the previous formula that was in a brownish-mauve bottle and was thinner. The old product cut through oil, hair spray, and polution. The new product, not so much.I do not need conditioners and would appreciate Mastey offering a choiceof the conditioning product and the oldie but goodie shampoo."
5,Fantastic Soundtrack,The person who gave this amazing soundtrack a one star rating must have a screw loose! The songs and artists listed by Amazon are all correct.
4,Review,This book was a great up to date book on a complete review of dental hygiene. It was easy to read and understand. Anyone in a time crunch should invest in this book. It has prepared me well for boards! Good Luck!
4,Needs more adjustments,I like it but I wish it was more adjustable.I need it to come up higher for some clients.
3,OK value,"The shipment and condition of the product were all great. The product itself, while it is a sling, really moves quite a bit. I have friend, I tested it out on while giving him a massage said he could take it or leave it. Was not that comfortable for him. He is 6ft+ and really needs somewhere to rest his arms while on the massage table prone. I have a small cheaper one that seems to work just as well and the hands rest in it directly under the table headrest no forearm support like this one."
3,Pretty smell.,"My friend has this lotion and perfume and I thought it smelled so pretty and sexy. I just had to try! Well, I got this and it smelled differently than I remembered. A little more musky than sweet. I bought it, because I was hoping my husband would notice and love it, but he hasn't even said a word about my new scent. :("
1,Too Thin & Runny,"Right scent, but far too runny and thin for lotion. I wouldn't waste my money on it again. If it's the scent I'm after, I will splurge for the perfume. The shower gel is nice though."
1,not what I expected...,I did not get the product that was initially advertised. I purchased a perfume and I got a body lotion. Not satisfied.
3,Just Can't Get Into It,"Bought this video after having purchased and mastered an introductory step routine. This one is just boring. The warmup is so bland, I have never gotten to the actual routine."
3,No issues,"The product works as advertised. The sould quality is not the best, but no issues with the setup. Little disappointed in the range of the transmission as I'm only getting about 30 feet, but I might need to adjust the location of the transmitter."
5,Does the job,"We are both have some hearing problems. By putting the speaker near to where we sit, we were able to turn the volume of the TV way down much to the delight of the neighbors. It was easy to install and worked right away. The only thing I'd like to see added is a remote control for the volume, but that's just being lazy on my part."
1,Unit does not work,"I ordered this item through Amazon, and was disappointed to discover that the unit did not work. Ordered a replacement through the manufacturer, and the second unit is also defective, according to the manufacturer's ""help line"". The most frustrating aspect will be getting my money back, since this is an Amazon ""sub-contractor"". Big mistake."
1,Don't waste your time,"I purchased the AW118 twice. The first one worked great the first time it was used. Then it would not work again. The second time the same thing happened. I think it is a problem with the ac adapter or a capacitor or something. I tried everything to make this hunk of junk work. I even called the manufacturer and they were no help at all. The weird thing is..when the speaker was totally unpowered it gave off a static sound occasionally. And when I tried to connect it again, the ac plug-in on the speaker actually arced. There is a serious problem with this speaker. Save yourself a trip back to store where you purchased it and go with anything else you can find."
1,Acoustic Research AW-811 Indoor/Outdoor Wireless Speaker (single),Bought two wireless speakers. One wouldn't turn on and the other wouldn't pick up the signal from the amp. Returned them both.
1,Acoustic Research AW-811 review,"The speaker was purchased for use on a deck. The speaker worked fine and had good sound. For a single speaker receiving its signal from my A/V receiver, I was completely satisfied. However the speaker only worked for about an hour and then went completly silent. The transmitter was working but the speaker did not respond. From past reviews, this was not an uncommon problem."
4,"Great speakers, but switch is problematic","The speakers sound much better than expected and the range is quite good. They are very simple to set up and work great with rechargeable batteries too.Turns out one of the speakers (I bought two) won't shut off (better than not turning on i guess!) and in calling Thomson's (new owner of Recoton) helpful and curteous (really!) support desk, they will replace it at no charge but i have to send back both speakers at my expense.Sooo.... since it's been only 30 days i'm returning the single defective speaker to Amazon for a replacement - Amazon will pay shipping and handling fees via UPS (now that's service!). I'll be doing mono vs. stereo for a few weeks, but it beats silence! :)"
3,Good but could be better,"Bought this unit to help my hearing impaired mother-in-law with TV listening. It's portability makes it convenient. Sound quality is fair.Has ""humming"" noise when TV volume is muted. Occasional high pitch interference is noted."
2,Did not work for me...,Kind of confusing connections. Spent 45 minutes reading and re-reading the directions. Never got it to work. RETURNED!
2,Connections don't make sense,"Well, the manufacturer wasn't really thining I'm sure many people buy these for their rear channel or as a extra set of speaker for their main system. Well, unfotunately their use is limited. You can not connect to the rear channel because only RCA plugs are supplied to connect to a pre-amp RCA plug if you have one or a to connect to the headphone jack. Well, the latter shuts off the sound to the entire system unless you hook into the cd player. Because it is an amp too, connections to the speaker outs (rear) would blow the speaker, so it really can only be used with the cd player or through the record out rca plugs that would go to a VCR or Tape player. Thus, you can not get just the rear channel to come through these. Sound is however pretty good!"
1,Not as advertised,I can't get good reception at any range from source. Intermittent when two rooms away from source. Have to move the speaker unit around to find an acceptable location. Doesn't automatically retune when being turned back on. Not at all what I expected from this piece of equipment.
3,Great,I read all the reviews and was a little worried about buying this product. It seemed like everything I read was 50/50. I'm no sound expert by any means but this thing sounds very good for a wireless speaker. No cutting out or static problems.
4,Confused on connections,"I purchased this speaker for my husband on Christmas. My plan was to hook it up to the receiver so we could listen to the digital music channels from our TV cable box when we are outside on our back deck or in the kitchen. The manual says to use either the Headphones jack (which then disables our regular speakers) or one of the A/V jacks which means you can't activate the cable music (hooked into Video 1). Anyway, I played around and by hooking up the transmitter to Tape Out I can still receive my cable music and use my wireless speaker. So far the speaker works fine for what we wanted it for and is cheaper than wiring our deck for waterproof speakers. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to hook this up to a receiver and wanting all other components to work."
3,AW-811 Outdoor Speakers,"The speaker performed poorly at a distance of greater than 50 feet from the receiver. The single speaker is weak and needs to have two speakers to provide adequate sound within the 0-50 ft range. Within the 0-50 ft range the sound was okay and for the price it is a ""good deal"""
4,Acoustic research wireless speaker,"We love our outdoor speaker, great sound from our bose system! Sometimes when you unplug the speaker and move it, you have to push the on/off button, but thats not that big of a deal."
1,Good Luck!,"If you can get one of these speakers that works you're in luck. The sound is o.k. for the product type. In my case I bought a pair(they must be purchased individually and although each comes with a transmitter, only one is required for a pair) but only one worked properly. Got a prompt replacement speaker from Amazon but this one wouldn't even turn on. A call to the manufacturer revealed that the maker (Recoton)went bankrupt and the customer service rep for the firm that bought them out as much as admitted that the speaker is junk (""we get calls about them all the time""). I'm sending them both back and moving on. Any suggestions?"
4,Success so far!,"I have been very pleased with my wireless speaker so far. I purchased it primarily to use on my roofdeck or in the garden. My XM radio is hooked up to my DVD player, and the wireless speaker is connected thru the headphone jack. The sound quality is fine for listening to baseball games or music from XM. The only problem I have had is that it is completely static on the roofdeck but I solved the problem by setting the speaker just inside the door, and the sound carries outside just fine."
1,BEWARE Electrical Issues,On my second speaker and about to take this one back as well. As others have commented the on-off switch is a problem. It worked fine (although the sound is poor) at first but then I couldn't get it to turn on. The second speaker would not turn off. I unplugged it so it wouldn't run all night and found that it would not turn on again. That on/off switch is defective. STAY AWAY
3,ok for the money,This is functional as a deck/patio speaker for a party or casual listening. I think the quality of sound is reasonable for that purpose. I bought one speaker. I am not sure that two speakers would provide true stereo effect. Easy to get up and running. Takes a little adjustment in placement to get best reception.
1,Does not Work - 3 separate units,"I decided on this outdoor speaker based on recommendations listed on Amazon. I am HIGHLY disappointed. The first unit simply did not work. After much hassle, I received a replacement unit (which I paid shipping to return the original). The second unit worked until we turned it off, then it would not come back on again. We received a third unit from the manufacturer and all seemed to be working fine - for about 2 days. Now it won't work again! I'm extremely disappointed in this product. Three months and 3 units later, we still do not have a functioning outdoor speaker!"
3,Go Wireless,"I purchased this product to add to my Bose Lifestyle sytem for our patio, while I liked the size of the speaker, the frequency adjustment knob drove me crazy, very difficult to adjust, and keep tuned in.I found a much better product at Brookstone for very little more cash.I returned my AR speaker to Amazon."
4,Utilitarian - Does What It Promises,"Overall, a good sound alternative for the outdoors. It has the range away from my receiver that it promised; the quality of the (mono) is pretty good, with a good bass undertone. If I had to nitpick, I would say that it picks up some interference on occasion - and yes, I did try all three different frequencies. But overall, it's great on the outdoor deck or in the backyard. It delivers as promised."
5,AR AW-811 Outdoor Wireless Speaker Review,"I needed an outdoor speaker so I could play our CD collection on our Sony Megachanger outside. The AW-811 does everything it's advertised to do. I hooked the transmitting antenna to the headset output of our stereo receiver and the speaker plays just fine outside about 30 feet away. It has good tone and a fair base, and was about $30.00 cheaper than Circuit City. Works for me."
3,wireless speakers,"This product is a great addition to anyone's home that does not have wiring or a home entertainment system capable of supporting multiple sets of speakers. These speakers can be used individually or in pairs for left/right separation. While they are not the high quality sound of your stereo speakers, they are great on the patio or in the bathroom. We have two and put one on each porch when we have company. Other times, we put one in the office and one in the master bath. When we enjoy either of our porches by ourselves, we put both of them for stereo sound. They are certainly worth the money."
1,The first one came broken,"The first speaker came broken, I first called the manufacture but they wanted me to ship it at my cost for repair, that was not acceptable. I then called Amazon and you took the item back promptly.When I tried to have replacement shipped I was informed the price had increased and I would have to pay the difference, since this is the speaker my wife wanted I was forced to pay the increased price. I am not happy with this tansaction."
1,not a satisfied customer,"When we received our product it did not work. We called the Customer Service and they told us to return it. As of today (August 19, 2006), we still have not received a replacement. We are very dissatisfied."
4,easy to move around,"Now if I could only fiure out how to turn it OFF. Anyone out there able to accomplish that without having to pull the cord from outlet, please let me know."
2,bought and returned on same day,"i just received my speaker, took it out of the box, read the directions, PLUGGED it in, turned it on, turned it off, packed it up and printed out a return slip...it worked well only when the speaker was near the transmitter...also, no one can tell me how long batteries will last; hence it needs to be plugged in (also, batteries charge when it is plugged in anyway)...i tried it outside and had to keep running back to the transmitter inside to make adjustments....waste of time...smarter to buy a portable boombox..."
1,Not worth the money,"These speakers were much larger and cumberson than I had expected. Plus if you weren't in direct line site of the transmiter, forget it. When they were close to each other, you did get sound. Ya, the sound from a channel on my tv. Changing channel selections on the unit got rid of the tv, but the sound was like that of a old $2 am radio.My recommendation is to go out to Radio Shack and buy some mini plug extentions, and forget about the wireless idea.An article in ""Wired"" said about the same thing in an article.art"
4,Pleazzzed,"we received an Acoustic Research speaker as a gift several months ago. We enjoyed the results so much we decided to buy another for a second room in our house. We cannot tell you how much easier it is to enjoy a surround type sound with this speaker. The volume on the television does not have to be ""cranked"" because the the sound is where you want.The only negative aspect of this cordless speaker is an occasional drop-out which might be interference from movement through the signal. If the speaker and transmitter are properly aligned, this occurs rarely. The quality of the sound from our television is not Bose, but it is very acceptable."
3,It's ok,"This product was purchased because of the concept. It is useful for mp3 player type things. I didn't realize that it would mute the sound on the tv or stereo and only have sound coming from the one speaker. Therefore this is not a speaker system you would use for a party, more for taking outside for washing your car. The sound is fair but still like the idea of it being wireless. Haven't tried it without the wire yet."
1,Speaker lasted only 15 days,"I purchased the speaker because we were having a going away party for my daughter (she enlisted in the Air Force). The party was on our deck and we hoped to play patriotic music for the occasion. But at the most critical time, it stopped working. No power light. Tried changing electrical outlets and using batteries to no avail and this was after having the speaker(working) for 15 days."
1,Worked for about a Mont,"Mine worked great for a little over a month, but the on/off switch had intermittent problems, and the unit finally would only stay on for 30 minutes or so. Warranty period of course is lapsed. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Experience with Beach Audio,"My experience with the supplier of this product ...Beach Audio.com....was unacceptable. Beware...if this product is defective...you will have to pay for return shipping and insurance which cost me $25.00. I had the first one for one month when it stopped working. I returned it at my expense....bought a new one..then they refunded my original puchase price. Now, the second one that I have had 2 weeks has experienced the same problem.I purchased one of these thru buy.com a year ago...and it is outside and runs beautifully yearround.I believe this supplier...Beach Audio has a defective product."
1,Cheap wireless speaker,"I had a very bad experience with this product. The signal would fade in and out even if I was relatively close to the source signal. When the signal faded out an annoying static sound would take its place. My parents have Indoor/Outdoor Wireless speakers that work great. This product has a nice price, but does not perform."
1,The speaker doesn't wok & I'm having difficulty returning it,"The speaker is defective, the on off button does not work, and although at first it received a faint but static signal at less then 30 feet away, it soon gave up the gost. [...]."
1,Same power issue as many others,I received it today. It turned on twice. Won't turn on again. Amazon is shipping a replacement today but I'm seriously considering just cancelling that and ordering a high powered FM transmitter and a half dozen $30 boomboxes and being done.
3,Overall satisfied,"It works as advertised, sound quality is adequate but definitely not ""hi-fi"" quality. I am a little disappointed in the transmitter. it is larger than I expected and I wish it was also battery powered. But it gets the job done more or less. But having a smaller, battery powered transmitter would be less awkward and wouldn't tie down a laptop computer so much. I end up having to be near a plug which sort of negates the portability of the laptop.Other than that, it works fine!"
3,mediocre sound,"Good distance, easy to set up...but sound quality is only fair, and not enough volume. The AR Indoor black pair have a better sound and are louder."
1,Wireless speaker,Absolute Junk..Poor sound quality and you have to be within 30 feet of the transmitter to even work!! You get what you pay for!!!Buy BOSE
2,boo,"This wireless speaker is hit or miss. Sometimes it works other times doesn't... Unless they upgraded this from 3 years ago, definately buy something else"
4,Good Quality And Portable,"I've been using this setup for a couple years now. It works great! Depending on where you set everything up, you may get static but just move it or change the channel. Works good inside and out."
5,A beautiful masterpiece!,"Listening to Storm of the Lights Bane makes me feel so many things at once. It has the power to put me in a trance whenever I listen to it. If I had to put this Cd into one word it would simply be beautiful. If your a fan of good Metal, than you must buy this. Hail Dissection! R.I.P Jon."
1,"The Big Picture, The Army ROTC","This was an absolute rip off. For the price of $14.95 you get a series of Army ROTC commercials looped together continuously for half an hour. I shall always treasure this video, it was a fairly cheap lesson that past practice is no indication of future preformance. Thankyou Amazon."
4,Great Start,"I've seen Kevin play with his wife, in Flowers For Zoey. They were a spectacular duet and amazed me at their raw musical energy and talent. On this album Kevin goes into the studio and does great work to his songs but I really do miss that stripped down sound that I discovered when I first experienced his music and message about Christ's love. This album is a must for anyone who loves true Christian Rock n' Roll. I hope Kevin does more great work in the future and I also plan on supporting his later projects. I encourage you to discover Kevin and I pray that he inspires you to live a more whole and full life.-Vinnie from Ontario Naz"
4,Quite Interesting...,"The album features the Muppets singing covers, usually with the help of a musical celebrity (Jimmy Buffet, Ozzy, George Benson etc.) I would highly recommend this to Muppet fans."
4,Awesome - classic Muppets,"This album is classic Muppets paired with famous singers - Kermit's version of ""Wild Thing"" alone makes this worth the price."
3,"Good, but not great...","I picked this one up, because I already have Reks' debut album, Along Came the Chosen. This one just wasn't as good. Sure, it's still better than most of the stuff out there today, but not what I expected out of Reks. Listening to his latest album, Gray Hairs, now that's the maturity I was looking for. If you're a fan of Reks, and want everything he does, pick this up. If you only want the very best stuff, skip it."
5,Jacob's Magic Box Discovery Series - Toys,A delightful little book where Jacob's Grandma shows him all kinds of toys. The story is written in wonderful and creative rhyme and appeals greatly to pre-schoolers. My grand-daughter is 2 1/2 and is enthralled with this book as well as the entire series. One of her favorite toys is Mr. Turtle - an extremely cute little fellow. The art work is creative and eye-catching for young ones. The book is highly interactive and captivating. It teaches that everything that comes out of the Magic Box goes back into the box at the end of the story which is a great teaching tool for putting things away at the end of play time. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to create an exciting learning environment for their young children.
1,Disappointed,"A previous reviewer had commented that the AMPS had been incorrectly reported for this product. It turns out when we received ours, that was still the case. Ours also arrived with a broken part but completely assembled (when instructions in the box talked about how to add on the bits and pieces) and without packing protection inside the router box. Frankly, it looked like it had already been used. We can't comment on the performance of the tool because we packed it up and sent it back almost as soon as it got out of the box once we saw the signs of wear on the baseplate. We have to commend Amazon for standing behind their guarantee. Yukon Tool needs to focus on quality control issues."
1,underpowered,"router is supposed to be 3.5 hp and is clearly not, got different model than they say it is, returned it and was sent the same one that is only 1.5hp very disapointed"
3,Leave Mozart alone,"When are these classical pianists going to understand that their little embellishments, their little trills added to the melody in a misguided pursuit of spontaneity, improvisation -- that these are not adding to Mozart, they are taking away? You can't improve on Mozart. You can only damage his music by getting in the way.On this disc Buchbinder does it once in the slow movement of No. 17, which is unforgivable, and several times early in the third movement, very clumsily, as though he hadn't quite made up his mind to improvise. At best it hurts the disc, at worst it ruins it.Without musical taste, talent is worthless."
3,Its not integrative,"I though that this book would approach migration theory by integrating the perspectives of different disciplines. However. the book its but a series of stand-alone essays written by people from different disciplines. As a result, it still lacks what migration theory needs, which is an integration of disciplines."
4,Journey of August King,My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. It's a good one to have in our collection for variety. I would recommend this for someone who wants a gentle evening to relax and not get in a dither before bed.
1,Less than 1 star,"This movie is VERY BAD, INDEED!Is totally predictable and disgusting!Sorry for her because she is a good actress."
4,Un libro que agrega espiritualidad a tu vida,"Compre las Siete Leyes Espirituales del Exito en espaNol y me parecio un libro muy facil de leer, yo lei una ley cada noche para tratar de absober los conceptos. El libro me parecio muy bueno y la traduccion esta bien aunque no es perfecta. Recomiendo este libro a todos aquellos que quieres ser un poco mas espirituales y quieren saber que pueden poner en practica cada dia para estar un poco mas en paz y mas felices."
5,Excellent Inspirational Book,"I have the book in English and Spanish, and after reading this book I thought it was going to be inspirational for my groups and I read some parts and after discuss about it, and the book have been a success because no everybody read. In this way I teach them the seven spiritual laws; one potentiality, two the law of giving, three cause and effect, four the law of least effort (but giving the best), five intention and desire, six detachment, and seven pourpose in life. Small book but full of excellent wisdom."
1,No Good!,After going through this 'Manual' I am left to wonder what martial art this person practices if any at all. It's nothing like the Tang Soo Do I grew up with. I would be curious to know if this auther has ever run a sucessful school.
5,Bought a replacement - due to over-useage,"I have had this book for several years, and without a doubt, it is THE most used reference book in my library. This is such an impressive teaching aid - it saves SO much time looking up themed or concurrent verses. Some fave lists include the prophesies Jesus fulfilled, Names of Jesus or God, Signs of End Times and what meaning each number has.I have used this book so much, I have decided to buy a replacement - so I don't lose any pages.You would not be disappointed to add this book to your reference library."
4,Great Deal...,"Good binocs for the price. Have not been submerged, but abundantly dripped on while kayaking. Remain watertight so far!"
3,it's ok,"Alpen TRAIL-TEC 8x28 Waterproof binocular with LCD digital compass, thermometer, clock is OK. the rubber lens cover broke right away so you couldn't attach it to the strap. The compass is little flaky. But my son is having fun with it."
2,Consider something else,"The binoculars are decent but the case came torn.I called Alpen, they sent me a cheap substitute case.I called Alpen again, now they sent the correct case.First time out with the binoculars, the center front screw falls out and the objective lens covers are lost with the screw.I called Alpen again, they sent improved lens covers and screw.These binoculars can't be found on Alpen's site so I can only conclude they are a design that was abandoned some time ago.Similar models on the Alpen site retail for over $50, so $26 here on Amazon is fair. Just wish I didn't have to keep calling the manufacturer for the issues I had."
2,The most boring book on the OED of the four or so that I've read,"I've read multiple books on the OED...and this is the worst of the lot.Obviously, when discussing the evolution of a dictionary, discussion about individual entries will come up from time to time...and yet, that discussion makes up fully 90% of this book. There's a bit of talk about how the trustees and the editor warred over the length of the dictionary as it developed...but absolutely everything else in the book is ""word X was put in, and then taken out. A note was written: ' is word X really necessary?'. A comment in the margins declared 'yes!'.Interesting enough for a page or two...but an entire book?Ugh.The book notably failed to establish a sense of place, a sense of time, or a sense of any of the personalities involved.I'd call it ""dry and academic"", but that would do a disservice to much good academic writing.Avoid!"
3,There are better versions of the story,"While Mugglestone's book starts off with great promise, the reader is given example after example of revised words -- and the prose is pretty dull. Much more entertaining and enlightening is Simon Winchester's The Meaning of Everything."
3,disappointed,"Product worked very well making hot coffee fast but the machine died after 1 year, I thought it would have had a longer life span."
1,Grounds In My Coffee!,"Really disappointed in this Mr. Coffee. The water doesn't drain/flow out of the filter basket quick enough causing it to overflow and collapse the paper filter. The result is that all the coffee grounds then end up in the coffee carafe itself. I contacted Mr. Coffee about the problem & they sent a new plastic basket. Same problem. Have tried 4 different paper filters, and 3 different ""grinds"" of coffee, and get the same results. Everything else is okay with this maker but I'll have to buy another coffee maker to replace this one because of this flaw. It won't be another Mr. Coffee brand."
2,coffee maker,does not make hot enough coffee when making 2-3 cups. Does not have the features my last coffee maker had
5,Just what I ordered,"I wanted a good, basic coffeemaker and that is just what I received. I have been very happy with it. I did get a reusable coffee filter and I am glad I did--not more messy, paper filters."
3,Red Trumpet Vine,"The Plants came to me as a plant , they were in great shape. healthy plants. Ohio Is Very Hot this Year with No Rain. I am out every night watering So I'm not sure if These are Very Slow Growers Or if its because of our weather. But so far they do look good. next yr i can give a better review i think. I have noticed with my orange trumpets Ive had for years now the first yr was extremely slow grower. after that they went crazy.over 30 ft long and just gorgeous, with hummingbirds everywhere . A BIG Caution Never Plant near a Building. Your Home Or outside Building, You will be sorry. Mine are all Planted Further out in my yard all are on a heavy grade trellis . It Took My Orange 2 yrs to bloom so i expect it out of my red also."
1,Seeds are a better bargain,"The service is great, but the product is awful. These tiny plants would locally sell for less than 50 cents, not the $10-$12 being asked at Amazon' The plants are are just a few months old, and not very healthy. Buy the seeds instead!PS: Soon after I posted my review, I noticed about 20 positive reviews with today's date on sellers storefront. Before that, there were one or two total! Hmmm.........So, just be warned, and be careful!"
1,does not fit the C-7000 zoom,Does not fit the olympus C-7000 zoom. mjor bummer as the list of cameras in the ad states that it does.
1,don't buy this blender,"This blender is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money on it. Mine didn't crush ice well, and like the other review states, it stopped working after about 20 usages. The motor died - very cheap quality."
2,Prefer different brand,"I bought the 1st one, it got burned in less than a full hand usages. Got a replacement for the 2nd one, the blade got stuck also less than 20 usages. Get a refund and look for better quality."
1,One size does NOT fit all!,"My dad bought this for my car, a Subaru Impreza 2008. The packaging states that it can fit in any car power socket, but it would not plug in all the way in my car. It goes in but not far enough to charge it and make it work. The package also states that if you bend the ""U"" tabs it can be adjusted to fit, so I gave it a try to see if it would make a difference. I bent one of the tabs too far and it snapped right off, so I am not able to return it. I do NOT recommend this product, it does not fit in every power socket as the label suggests!"
1,Broke before the end of the day,"Bought at a Pilot truck stop. The damn thing wouldn't fit in any plugs, luckily had a 3 way splitter to try it on. After a few hours it was dead and emitting a high pitched hissing noise.Oh yeah, the prongs are EXTREMELY sharp and very dangerous. While bending them out to hold in the lighter socket I cut my finger extremely deep. Took about 2 weeks to heal.I would highly advise against purchasing."
3,Pretty Good - no instructions,"Found the Floor Stapler worked fine, once I figured out how to assemble it, load staples - simple tasks once you do them, but the tool came with zero information. The DVD was just product advertizing, and the printed materials were a parts list."
4,Perfect fit for a hard wood staple gun,I'm using these with my Porta-Nailer 461 stapler and they work very well.
2,Limited excellence,"There are detailed graphics, maps, and explanations of cultural issues not found in other guide books. However, they exclude major attractions and maps and attractions can be severely inaccurate. It's good for preparing a trip, but it's too heavy and not helpful enough to bring with you."
3,Out Of Date,"This is a great book with beautiful pictures, maps and nice glossy color pages. The only problem being that it is out of date! Having said that, I would not recommend it for your guide book if travelling to Thailand. Wait for an updated issue.I am well travelled in Thailand and some of the descriptions in the book make me feel like I was travelling in Thailand 20 years ago! Hope this helps..."
2,"great pictures, little information","I bought this book because of its visual impact. The pictures are great, but... I was looking for information on hotels, advise on what to avoid and where to go, hints and discovered very little in that regard. This is not a travel book, but a souvenir."
2,Beautiful but Dumb,"This phone is so pretty and nice and I love it.... but the CLARITY SUCKS! I even returned it to try a second one and the clarity sucks on it too. I hooked up my bluetooth earpiece and I could finally have extended conversations w/people without having them have to repeat every other sentence (which gets really annoying.. let me tell you) I'm tempted to go back to my 2yr old phone which had no problem with clarity (but is ugly :( So, unfortunately, don't buy a book by it's cover. boo."
1,Repetitive and poorly edited writing style.,"It seems clear that much research went into this book, unfortunately with very little visible editing. There is much tedious repetition of the same point. Extraneous information peeks out at us without elaboration. It is true that New York emerged as the center of American publishing, but why tantalize the reader with this fact by means of a single sentence in the midst of several pages about the garment industry. The treatment of the 1911 Triangle fire is far too minimal, and suggests, erroneously, that this was a solely Jewish experience. This is most emphatically not the case, either in terms of the victims or the long term political consequences both for Jews and the Democratic party."
3,Diner review,"Diner does a very nice job in this work. No heavy stuff, just a very good read about the history of the Jews coming to America and how they made their way in this new land. Very sensitive to this group of people, but also very lively and exciting. Demonstrates how the Jews wanted to assimilate and become true ""Americans."""
1,There's A Better Way,"If you buy this book and have no previous knowledge of Dreamweaver MX, you are a dummy. The authors may be nice persons, but they are not teachers. You'd be better served using the small manual that comes with Dreamweaver than this book, which is so disorganized it should come with a machete.Everyone knows the best way to learn is ""by doing."" Early on in Dreamweaver MX for Dummies, you will make a blank web page, put a title on it - and never see that page again. Conversely, the DW MX manual starts off with you building a static three page web page. Do it a couple of times, and you are on your way.I suggest that if you need a reference book (which you do) spend your money on Dreamweaver MX Unleashed by Pizzi and Ruvalcaba - much better organized with everything you ever wanted to know about Dreamweaver MX."
2,Unfocused,"After reading the other reviews, I thought I had come across a gem of a book. However, the stories were only mildly interesting and unfocused, like something you might read if you participated in a short story workshop."
4,I did it... in reverse order,"Becoming a lover of metal during the reign of KoRn and then turning to other things like Slipknot and later coming back a bit to Shadows Fall, the first album I discovered by In Flames was Come Clarity. It was right down my alley. All I ever read was how much In Flames had lost over the years and how much better the older stuff was. Well, I have all the In Flames now. I got them in reverse order (except for Sense of Purpose which is also good) and came to appreciate their whole catalogue. I am amazed though at how much more melodic guitar work there is on this album. If you are getting this later on after enjoying the new stuff like me, be prepared for the soaring melodic guitar work instead of the low-tuned chugging riffs you're used to."
2,Pretty boring,"Well, what can I say. I only heard good things about this album, but to be honest - it is pretty boring. Much better are Dark Tranquillity's ""The Gallery"" and above all ""The Mind's I"".The only really good song here is ""Behind Space - Live"". Everything else is so not-raw. A bummer."
4,Great Melodic Metal!,"These Swedes pack a powerful punch! I wish you could award decimal places because this album is a 4.8 in book. Fantastic, start to finish. If you are more of a Black Metal fan, this may not be the group for you, but if you value musicianship look no further. In Flames has the best musicianship of any other metal group, PERIOD. Just listen to thier ability to incorporate acustics seemlessly into the full-on metal feel that the rest of the album carries. This albuim is epic and an instant classic. ""Jester Race"", ""Lord Hypnos"", and ""Artifacts Of the Black Rain"" are the highest points on this album. Fantastic, a must own!"
5,Is it me or is there not 1 bad thing about this cd?,no wait there is..... its too short! Hand this cd to any metalhead and they will tell you the same. Its just magnificant. I cant explain how good it is in words. I mean the 2 solos on dead eternity are just jaw dropping. RIP in flames. you will never be the same again
5,awesome album,This cd is amazing. Every song is exceptional. There are really no weak points whatsoever. This and Whoracle are the best In Flames cds.Moonshield - 8.5/10Jester Dance - 9/10Artifacts of the Black Rain - 10/10Graveland - 8/10Lord Hypnos - 9.5/10Dead Eternity - 8/10The Jester Race - 9/10December Flower - 10/10Wayfaerer - 9/10Dead God In Me - 8.5/10Goliaths Disarm Their Davids - 10/10Gyroscope - 8.5/10Acoustic Medley - 10/10Behind Space - Live - 7.5/10
5,Gods Gift To Metal,"This is without a doubt the BEST In Flames album ever. Every track is worth listening to. Awesome vox that you just dont find anywhere else. The band is phenominal and the production is top-notch.Highlights: Moonshield, Dead Eternity, Lord Hypnos, Gyroscope"
5,The Jester Race\Black Ash Inheritance,"Showcasing brilliant drumming, awesome vocals and ripping guitar, The Jester Race\Black Ash Inheritance is a masterpiece of Melodic Death Metal. With epic's like 'Dead Eternity', 'The Jester Race', 'Wayfaerer' and 'Dead God In Me' In Flames truly claim their title as the kings and pioneers of Melodic Death Metal. Achieving for the genre what Metallica did for metal, and what Pantera did for breakdowns, In Flames kick some serious ass with this album.THough the cover art is mediocre, the album is definetely their best. The drumming on this album is awe-inspiring, and the singing sends shivers down your spine and he spits out songs like 'Moonshield' and 'Lord Hypnos'. The guitar is spectacular and some of the solos here are among In Flames best yet.Any fan of: Opeth, Kalmah, Dark Tranquility etc. etc. will like this album. And if you buy it, it will never stray to the bottom of your CD collection, because you will be listening to it every day."
1,more like BLACK @$$ INHERITANCE!,"once again no talent or structure, just another scream scream scream band. the only thing they have kind of ok is Reroute to Remain, and that still has alot of faults. they should go back to britain, cause we dont need them here!"
4,Even friends hide things from each other,"The other reviews address the story line of this tale quite well. But what I found most interesting was how the introduction of a mysterious and somewhat sexually ambiguous young man into the midst of close friends suddenly changes what friendship means. No one comes out of this tale looking like a saint, and it will be a cold and calculating reader that will be unable to find a bit of themselves in each character. This book is a character study, with each character at the center of a series of set pieces. A reader looking for a clear plot line won't find one. But the characterizations are superb, the narrative voice expressing each character with an authenticity that is too infrequently found in much of today's literature."
2,Pales in comparison,"The Salt Point, an earlier work by Paul Russell, pales in comparison to his much stronger, more mature effort in The Coming Storm. Both books explore similar topics, including powerfully addictive but unwise relationships and how the choices we make affect those around us. But in The Salt Point, the narrative over-indulges in contemplating the characters rather than simply presenting them and letting the reader draw conclusions. Three of the main characters engage in the kind of endless introspection that would make them insufferable were they real people. Ironically, the character Leigh felt the most real to me, even though he is the story's central enigma.In short, readers new to Russell should skip this one and head directly for The Coming Storm."
2,Melodrama in the veins,"I've read two of Paul Russell's other novels (The Coming Storm and War Against the Animals), and this one is just not up to their level. The characters seem lost with no sense of themselves apart from their melodramatic hunger. It's as if the myth of Narcissus is seen only in terms of it's mirror images when the pool itself offers more depth, but the novel is afraid to get in over it's head."
2,Needs romanized pronounciation guide,"This is a nicely produced CD Mac or Windows compatible with good graphics, layout and most importantly, male and female speakers.However, there is only Tamil script to show pronouciation! There is no romanized pronouciation guide to help you form the words correctly. Even as a pretty experienced foreign language speaker, I felt frustrated to have to rely only on my ear and mimicry of the speakers."
1,Home movie,"This DVD offers no value whatsoever. It's a home movie of places in Maui, with (get this) NO NARRATION. It offersd no description of anything that you are seeing! Just some music in the background. The video is also very amateur. Complete with bouncing camara shots and jerky panning motion. It looks like my home movies. I cant believe this item was even offered for sale on Amazon! DONT BUY IT."
1,Take your own home movies and skip this one,"I agree with the review above. I wouldn't mind having no narration, but I do want to know what I'm seeing so that I can perhaps go there myself. Not recommended."
1,Please! Visit the islands anyway!,Don't judge beautiful Hawaii by this photographic/video disaster! How do these things get on Amazon??!!
5,I think the DVD is great,"I think the DVD is great and so do 9 others who have seen them. They think the DVDs are outstanding. The idiot from California who left the negative feedback above is obviously either a competitor, or a loser who has tried to succeed but could not due to his brainless stupidity, so he has to try to destroy others efforts. Oh well, losers will be losers."
4,Ambler's last novel; a winner.,"The Care of Time was Eric Ambler's last novel and it's a winner. Ambler was THE master of novels of suspense and intrigue, and with this book he clearly demonstrated that he maintained his skills in this genre to the end. The opening pages are gripping and the ensuing plot is full of twists and turns, leading to a logical and satisfactory conclusion. Fans of suspense and intrigue -- and superb writing -- will not be disappointed."
4,Wonderful thriller,"The Care of Time may have been Eric Ambler's last novel, but he saved the best for last! Ambler, a master at weaving suspense and intrigue, demonstrates the skills he is so well-known for in this last novel. Ambler grabs the reader in the opening page with the delivery of a warning letter to Bob Halliday, telling him a bomb is to follow. Ambler goes on to spin a suspenseful tale that doesn't turn us loose till the last page. A spy mystery at its best, the plot is full of twists and turns, but leading to a satisfactory conclusion. You'll have to buy this book used, but you won't be sorry for looking for it."
