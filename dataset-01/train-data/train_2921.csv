1,Where are the titles of these films?,"If Amazon would show the buyer an image of the back of this multi-pack movie set (COLLECTOR'S CLASSICS; FILM NOIR, VOL 2), we could see what titles are in the collections. As it is, there is no information on what the customer is buying."
3,Collector's Classics: Film Noir Vol. 2,"To determine what movies are featured on this DVD, enlarge the movie's logo and you'll see that it includes ""The Scar,"" ""Quicksand,"" ""Too Late For Tears"" and ""The Man With The Golden Arm"". RLF"
1,Way to Small,"I was exspecting this tea set to at least be a medium size, but no it was very small and it's porcelin so it's not very durable. I disliked this a lot the cutest thing about it was the basket."
3,Tea set,"The shipment came on time, but unfortunately one of the teacups was broken secondary to poor packaging. The set is cute. I was getting it as a present for my niece. I didn't have time to risk trying to exchange it and ended up going to the mall and picking out another set."
2,"Choppy, Poor Song Selection, DANGER: RELIGION!","This is an OK CD, with some decent instruction. However, I found the frequent stopping in the middle of lines distracting, and I kept wishing that there would be a sing-through of the whole line before going in and examining the problem bits.The worst aspect is the choice of songs. With the wealth of popular songs out there that a huge number of people are bound to know, the inclusions of ""Angel from Montgomery"" and ""One of Us"" are lamentable decisions. I'm reasonably well acquainted with pop music in its various guises, and these just aren't part of the collective memory the way ""I Can See Clearly Now"" and a legion of others are. Further, the religious content in ""One of Us"" is so nauseating, it completely distracts anyone who isn't prepared to immanently disappear in the Rapture. One can't help but wonder if Anders thinks she might be one of them. I'm not sure I'll ever get the vomit smell out of my car. Thanks, Susan. Thanks a lot."
4,Harmony singing,"I like the songs on this CD and enjoy playing it while working in the kitchen for vocal practice. I would compare the approach on the CD to learning a language conversationally--there is only a little theory and you learn by copying. It's good as far as it goes, but I'd like to get more theory."
5,Great Book,"This book describes a group games from low to high activity levels. It is for the young and old as well as the fit and infirm. It unites a group of people through play. The games are essentially non-competitive. Teachers, employers and individuals who give parties can use these innovative fun activities. The book has an overview which categorizes the games according to activity level, timing, number of people needed, cognitive attributes, physical demands as well as other elements.I have no financial interest in this book and I do not know anyone who participated in it's production. 5 23 04"
2,Not As Expected,"As the other response stated, I felt this ad was misleading as well. I was expecting 6 stakes since the title was GARDEN STAKES (plural) - but only one came. It is a very very cute stake, but I don't know that I would have paid the price for just one - especially when you aren't given an option to the color or style."
5,Not exactly what it seems,"This item is actually the Always Feel This Way EP, which contains an acoustic version of Love Love Love, Daisy, Crazy, and a live version of Get Away. I bought it because it is listed as the Shy That Way single, which it is not. I already had a copy of this CD I got from CD Japan. But oh well. I still like it :)"
4,"Great CD, but cant be copied to PC","This is an excellent 5 track EP. Tristan's voice is beautiful, the production is clean, and each track unique. I put this CD in my stereo on a long drive to NY, and found myself going back to it for days. When I got home, I couldnt wait to put it on my Ipod. No dice. The CD is protected and (unless there is something I have missed)couldnt be played by any program. A message comes up telling you that this CD is protected.If youre looking for a great EP, this is it. If you want to use it digitally, you will have to move on."
1,WRONG TITLE,"If you are expecting Shy that way, do not but this EP! The title is actually Always Feel That Way. Still a good EP if you like Tristan, but I was dissappointed because I wanted to hear Shy That Way!"
5,Loved this book!,"My daughter studied colonial history in fourth grade, in Virginia, and I ordered a few books for her on the topic and as soon as the books arrived, she chose this one first and sat down and read the whole thing! She loved it."
1,Arrived leaking and broken,"I ordered this Garam Masala paste, as my husband and I have recently started cooking Indian food. Open it's arrival at my door step, the cardboard was covered in oil. The product had leaked out through the bubble wrap. It was clearly not packaged well. I've submitted a photo of the package and product condition. Hoping Amazon steps up to replace it."
3,Too much trouble,"The furniture looks good. BUT!! To assemble it was quite a headache.The holes to screw the pieces together are not aligned properly.So it was very difficult to screw the bolts in. On top of that, they are to be screwed in with an allen wrench, and unless you have petite hands or are a Saint, it is very, very frustrating.The middle table is not quite rectangular. When the glass is put on top, you can see some space on the side.Over all, for $300.00 I would say it would be worth some of the frustration, but since I paid $300.00 + $100.00 for shipping, I don't think its really worth $400.00, to go thru the hassle. If I see it in a store all assemled, then yes, I would buy it. The furniture itself is not bad, inspite of the table.I was going to buy two sets. But after reading some of the reviews, I decided to buy one and see how it goes before placing an order for the second one. Now I'm glad I only bought one."
3,Don't trust what Amazon says!,"In Amazon's review, they say it has an external LCD screen to see who's calling before you answer it. It DOESN'T! Be warned! Amazon refuses to fix the error as well!"
4,i LOVE my nextel!!!,"i have literally had dozens of phones, with all the companies you can name, sprint being the last company(they sucked!) and i can tell you BY FAR that this company, and this phone are hands down the best i have ever had! this phone is tough! my cats knocked it off my fridge and it fell to the hard tile, breaking it in two parts at the flip joint. even though it was broke in two....it still worked!! i called nextel, reported it broken, and in less then 36 hours i had a new factory sealed phone in my hand! they are great...the phone is great(i get signal in my basement!) and their customer service is outstanding!!"
3,pretty good phone.,"I had this phone for about six months and I loved it . The only thing I did not like about it is that it was not a color phone. Other than that I loved the rings, I loved the settings and it was worth the buy. But then it started acting weird. It would turn itself on and off. It would cut off all of my conversations and more. One time I let my girlfriend use it and she dropped it on the concrete, and that was it. The phone was dead. Later I bought a motorola I860. Much better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"I've read other reviews that it can stand a shock. It can't. I dropped it out of my pocket and it died. Motorola wouldn't fix it under warranty. I paid $140 to have it fixed, and the screen immediately died. Motorola wouldn't fix it under warranty again. Another $140. The sound quality is horrible and the shape of the phone is very difficult to work with. The worst phone I've ever owned."
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT GO WITH NEXTEL,The menus are incredibly hard to readIt comes with the most ear screetching sounds one can ever hearYou can't down load anything on to itThe thing is so huge that when you put it in to your pocket there is a humongous bulgeWhen you put it on you belt you pants start to fall down
1,Unreliable,"My wife and I both have these phones. I am on my fourth phone in ten days, my wife had hers replaced within 2 months. I had plenty of reception but a glitch in phone prevented my from making calls. This happened with two of the phones. The third had a small glitch. Nextel has been unhelpful in all of this."
2,Ugly,"I hate this phone. I ordered it over the phone sight unseen because it was the cheapest flip phone Nextel had at the time. My friends dubbed it ""The Batphone"" and they tease me lots every time it gets broken out. It is huge and clunky and has absolutely no extra features. It's good qualities are decent reception and durability."
1,I530-AWEFUL!!!!,"MY HUSBAND BOUGHT THE NEXTEL I530 A YEAR AGO. WHEN WE LIVED IN PHILADELPHIA, HE GOT GOOD RECEPTION, ETC. NOW HIS PHONE SHUTS OFF WHEN HE TALKING TO SOMEONE, NO ONE CAN REACH HIM BECAUSE A MESSAGE COMES ON SAYING ""PLEASE HOLD WHILE WE TRY TO CONTACT THIS NEXTEL SUBSCRIBER."" HE DOESN'T GET RECEPTION IN CHALFONT, PLYMOUTH MEETING, AND SOME AREA OF PHILADELPHIA. MY HUSBAND TOOK IT TO CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR THE 4TH TIME NOW AND THE GUY TOLD HIM ALOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PHONE. MOTOROLA STOPPED MAKING IT. HE HAS ALSO LOST ALOT OF BUSINESS WITH THIS PHONE BECAUSE NO ONE CAN GET THROUGH. HIM AND I BOTH GOT NEW UPGRADED PHONES AND WE LOVE THEM. JUST SO YOU KNOW, I530 STINKS!!!!!!"
2,A pre-paid for $40 was better than this!,"I still have yet to dicover how to send a text message - but have gotten them. I am starting to believe there is no way to write a text message on it, unless I pay extra and sign up for the web on the phone too. There is no alarm feature or games. I did the tracfone pre-paid before this and that was much cheaper with a nokia that had much better features. I wish I had played with this at the store before getting stuck with it for two years."
1,Don't Buy It,"I got this free from a family member who knows nothing about cell phones. It drops calls everyday. It loses the signal all the time; even when it is just sitting idle. I don't know who is worse, Nextel or Motorola. I have Verizon, but the bill is always high. I recently got T-Mobile and they are the only ones who charge long distance. I've had cell phones since 1999 (now 2005) and I NEVER paid long distance before. All of the above mentioned companies have absolutely HORRIBLE customer service. They lack severely in that area. They don't answer emails--that is, if you can find an email address on their website; they keep you on hold, and when they answer they have no idea what they are talking about or what their company sells. They don't care about you, the only care about your money. Be careful with cell phones and usage. Buyer beware."
5,A favorite,"A good Holmes pastiche is difficult to write.Watson's 'voice""--the literary style Doyle affected in writing the Holmes stories--is challenging for a post-Victorian writer.But it is carried off well here!The idea for the novel is a good one, & it reflects the chaos of the Martian Invasion quite well."
2,Bee-zarre!,"Gotta hand it to the authors... it takes a lot of moxie to follow in the combined footsteps of Arthur Conan Doyle and H.G. Wells. And to do it, you gotta be a) unbelievably talented (lal Mozart), b) crazy, or c) infused with hubris. Maybe all three. This book demonstrates only two.. the later two.While the style is mildly convincing of the genre(s), ultimately the story is thin and the book forgettable. A heroic, but foolhardy attempt I'm afraid.But I HAD to read a book with this title!"
3,A mixture of good and bad...,"I happen to be a fan of Wells' 'War of the Worlds' and also a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. The book tries to explain some loose ends from the 'War of the Worlds' story and suggests some interesting ideas, like the Martians might be the result of a breeding problem or that they brought the red weed to Earth to 'terraform' it. Yet most of the time our Heros are running for their lives. They can do nothing but wait for the invaders to die and do very little to fight off the alien invaders (who might not even be from Mars).Also, I found the idea that Sherlock Holmes was able to STOP using drugs and STOP hating women at the same time to be slightly unbelievable.I would suggest it for fans of H.G. Wells or fans of Sherlock Holmes. Enjoy it."
1,clear backpack,i wasn't a good product in two week the strap of the back pack as rip. i wasn't going to the problem of sending it back this backpack was not worth it and it wasn't good product.
5,Perfect for what I needed it for.,I ordered the All Clear backpack to take to an event that I could bring water and food in as long as the event staff could see what you were bringing - this was perfect.
2,Very Small Backpack,This backpack is very small and only 1 or 2 books at the most can be carried in this backpack. I regret buying this backpack. Check the length and width before buying!
1,Went through three bags,"I thought this would be a good bag to carry my stuff to work in. It would be the right size and acceptable by security. The first bag had one of the shoulder straps start to separate from the body almost immediately, The second one had the plastic below the strap area tear away from the body on the back side after less than a week. The third one did both of these in a matter of a couple days use"
1,Awful,Tore up within days my son had it. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It's just a waste of money for it to be $9 :(
5,Top Noch Quality - Great Price,"Purchased this item and notice the brightness and sharpness is top quality.Love it, Love it!!!"
2,Cheap monitor,"Some screwdriver assembly required to attach monitor to base. Speakers in the back produce muffled, tinny sound, worse than my $15 cheapo speakers. On-screen menu frustrating and annoying to use. Picture quality not very good - gave me a headache in under an hour. A bit too much afterimage for me, even just scrolling text to read web pages, let alone playing games. Difficult to adjust tilt. Very bright screen, although it can be dimmed.Overall - might be good for putting in a window for passers-by to see, but I don't want it on my desk. Not recommended."
4,"light punk, pretty good","good music, good bands, good mixthough i wouldn't pay 25$ for iti payed 8$ for it at HMV"
5,A great compilation,"I found this album in a discount rack and bought it because I'd heard of a couple of the artists, namely ALTAN and EILEEN IVERS. I was pleasantly surprised by the whole album. As a compilation it flows quite nicely and will stand a s a pretty good introduction to the breadth and skill of celtic music and musicians available for your enjoyment."
1,Grateful sound,Great sound and production. This one will get you up and dancing. The Dead always sound awsome live.I'm Glad I found it.
4,"Nice little set, don't expect too much though.","I bought this set because they were selling it really cheap and I have a small collection of swords. For being such a small set of swords it looks fine and the swords have some small details on them, it will catch some attention if you place it right but don't expect to see anything fancy or to wow people with.The swords themselves are not sharp bladed, still like all pointy objects they should only be handled by someone responsible and out of the reach of children.I wouldn't call it a must have item or something that will become a collector's item, it will be just another ornament to put on a shelf. Still, if you're an incurable sword collector or have a small space to fill on a shelf this little item will do just fine."
3,too bad,"this is a let down from erick -- too commercial!!! if you like an quivalent of ""top 40"" in house/club music, then this cd is for you! my favorite out of three cds is #3 which is vocal and diva house. it's the only one that sounded fresh (and i am not a fan of vocal or diva house at all)."
5,Subliminal Sessions Three,"What can I say? Typical Morillo, not for the johnny come-lately club head. Lots wont get it, but as a club head from the 80s, oh yeah, this one is smoking. As always Morillio Brings it on this one!!"
2,Not durable,"I purchased this toy for my four year old grandson for Christmas 2011. He loves cars and trucks and I thought this fit the bill. It is large and it steers and the roof comes off and the tail gate and hood open. Well, within a week, the spare tire on the tailgate broke off. It didn't appear to be attached very well for toy played with by kids. I don't think I will be buying this brand anymore."
4,very useful,"This is a great tool to give a quick index to many different topical passages of the Bible. Personally I am a kjv fan and this is based entirely on the niv, but still worth it"
3,Where to put the lamp? Paint it on the wall...,"OK to be fair this book teaches different painting techniques successfully. But throughout the examples it seems like they HAVE to paint everything possible. Rather than put a real plant in a room, they paint one onto a wall. Rather than install a tile floor or brick wall, they paint fake ones in. It all just has sort of a comical feel when finished. If you flip through a Pottery Barn catalog and consider that tasteful, then these designs leave alot to be desired. Buy this book for technique, but consider others for inspiration."
3,Debbie Travis' Painted House,"I first saw Debbie Travis on the Oprah show and was very impressed with what I saw and the examples she gave, as I live in Australia I contacted Amazon and had the books sent out. My mistake... I was so disappointed as I expected there to be examples of what she had shown on the show,as well as practical everyday ideas that one would use, instead there was page after page of similar finishes that mostly were not suitable for a private house. I might add I have been using these finishes for some years. In essence I wasted my money, which is double yours."
4,Painting projects done simply and with a unique twist.,"I was first made aware of this book on the Oprah Show,and seeing the transformations and how simple they were to do made getting this book a must for me. Debbie's use of everyday materials makes each project easy to do even for novices. I recommend this book for those who would like a particular look, but are hesitant to hire a professional because of costs etc. This book is a must have!"
3,I expected more...,"I was looking for a design idea for my house and I got a quick overview of detailed techniques. I didn't get a good idea of all of the techniques to use on a floor, what I'd need for vinyl..It is alright to look through."
5,Best book on the subject,"We used the ragging off method in this book to do up a little girl's room. We did it in shades of peach and beige, with a pretty wallpaper border in matching shades from the local building supply store. It didn't cost much and the result is STUNNING. I'm not a fan of a lot of stenciling, faux this and that, but I have to say, this book has techniques that really look amazing.We practiced on scraps of wood or wall board to gain confidence before plunging in. I can't wait to try some of the other techniques.If you run out of rooms and furniture to renovate, you can always restore yard-sale finds and donate them to church or school craft fairs. WAY too much fun. This book is a real treasure."
1,Poor advertising,"The Technical Details indicate 10 boxes of 1000, but I only received 1 box. This is way too much money for a single box of stir sticks. I won't be ordering from this seller again."
2,Came damaged,Nice earrings but the omega backs came damaged. I was disappointed with this product. I had no problem with how the earring looked just the condition.
3,Moments In Time,"This collection of expressions is brief, but moving. The poems are personal, yet applicable to anyone. You can feel the emotions the author is experiencing. Jude Brattoli was a gifted writer."
4,EARTHMOVERS!,"Super-Duty Earthmovers by Eric C. Orlemann hits you right in the face with colorful pictures of gargantuan machines that you rarely ever see. Orlemann shows various angles of the machines with pictures of humans and automobiles for scale, so that you can put into perspective just how large the machines really are. Overall, Orlemann's usage of big colorful crisp pictures along with stats and miscellaneous information makes Super-Duty Earthmovers a very interesting and enjoyable book. This book is a MUST for earthmoving machinery fans!"
2,I had to write this so u will avoid it,This book is a rip off with no more then maybe 50 pages it isnt worth 16bucks! The pics are great but still not enought! dONT BUY IT!
3,It is a book about rather specific sauna,I ordered that book because I wanted to construct a sauna in my basement. Based on the publisher's recommendation I felt very confident that I will find all the necesseary information to help me with my project. To my deepest disappointment this book deals only with a very specific type of a sauna : one that is constructed from logs in a cement base. That is one of the limitations of the internet store : you never know what you are getting.
3,Cordwood sauna construction,"This is a decent book on cordwood construction, with some emphasis on saunas, but it shows up frequently in searches of DIY sauna building books. Unlike cordwood construction is on your plate, this isn't the book you want.There's a nice sauna cabin layout described in the book, but it's just a couple of pages."
2,Mistitled,"This book should be called The Cordwood Sauna. If you are looking for a book about cordwood saunas, this is the book for you. If you are looking for information about any other type of sauna, looks elsewhere. Of the 200 pages, about 20 of them are not specific to cordwood saunas (and their construction)."
1,Music overpowering,"I would have liked to hear the lapping of the ocean waves and the soft rustle of the reeds waving in the wind with soft music in the beckground. Instead, I strain to hear the relaxing sounds of nature when all I can hear is music.Nice photography."
4,Perfect for kids,"My son was so ecstatic when I gave him this. He hasn't let most of the toys out of his sight, he even sleeps with them. I've been looking for these everywhere, but in Canada they cost upwards of $35. For what Amazon was selling these for, I had to get it."
3,its cool,"Not a big gift, but my son was very happy with this. We just got back from Sea World so he dug it."
3,Great for the bath,"As other reviewers have mentioned these make excellent bath toys for kids into dolphins and whales. Bath toys with holes make no sense! These float and collect zero mold. That being said the quality isn't fantastic, if you're expecting Schleich you will be sorely disappointed. The heads are actually visibly attached to the body on a seam which is really distracting to me, although my daughter could care less. Overall, a good buy for the price."
1,Bad Tasting,I love rye. Several years ago I always purchased rye crackers in a grocery store and they were discontinued. I thought these might be similar and they are not. They do not even taste like rye. Also they are very very hard. Do not waste your money. I am giving them away or throwing the other boxes out.
3,Satisfactory Prep,"I found this book to be only average. It covers only basic math in its review. Mistakes can be noticed throughout the book. These mistakes throw off answers and make problems seem much more complex than they really are. Be prepared to see problems which have no solution as they are written. This book certainly deserved to have been proofread before publishing. Overall, I rate the book with a C+."
2,Is/Was/We're....Good/Great song.,"Since it's put out by the Time/Life seller's You can be sure that they are ALL the 1st. run Original radio recording,But The same ole stuff repacked in different colored cd jewel cases AGAIN! Unless your JUST getting started for the 1st. time,or starting over again there are much better choices out there.."
4,One of the best study aids,This book breaks down Tort law tremendously. It was highly recommended by a second year law student and it totally helped when it came time for finals. It takes each section of the Prosser and Wade text and breaks it down into the most basic form. I'd recommend to all.
4,"A fun, if not serious read","I started reading this one on the bus late last week and finished it on a flight this weekend. I was laughing pretty hysterically through the first few chapters where the central character describes pulling together a first showcase for a play she's written recently. I've recently helped a friend produce a showcase, so much of the comedy struck a still-exposed nerve. The plot gets more serious as it continues and we get to hear all about the main character's sexual hangups , but still with a very good sense of comedy. (The title is somewhat tounge-in-cheek, she doesn't really have sex throughout most of the book.) It's not serious reading, but author Stephanie Lehmann writes very well with a good sense of timing and plot development, as well as some interesting, though somewhat stereotypical characters. Great for just relaxing with.Some would say that this is sort of a ""chick book"" and they might be right. I enjoyed it nonetheless."
1,Worst book,"This was one of the worst books that I have ever read.It was very poorly written and not funny at all.It was very disappoining to pay [money]for something like this.I am a big *Sex And The City* fan,this book is NOTHING like it as it leads you to believe in the comments on the jacket."
5,An Amazing Book,"I don't know how anybody could rate this book with only one star! I mean, come on now...this book is written so well, it's got humor, grief, strugle, and everything else all in one! There is a little bit of something for everybody in this book. I recomend that everybody go get it now. In one way or another, you will be able to relate to at least one of these unique characters."
5,"""Like having am extra set of hands""","I've owned one of these for quite a number of years and recently purchased another to give my son who recently purchased a new home.Being able to be at one spot and with the push of a lever send the end of the tape to another spot without getting up off the floor to try and hook it to something saves you a lot of time,when working on a project.It does weight a lot more then an ordinary tape measure,so it isn't something you would want to carry around on your belt all day.Other then that it is one great tool to help get that job done quicker.In a upright position,the tape itself will stay stiff out to a certain point like the manufacturer saids.I'd give this a thumbs up."
3,Tape Measure,"This is a great idea, we purchased it for my husband for Christmas. However, he uses it very rarely, he is use to working with the good ole' fashioned tape measure that it doesn't occur to him to use this one. I'm not so sure that it is as handy as one tends to believe. But then again, not everyone is stubborn to change. :)"
1,Nothing but JUNK,"Save your money, B&D should have never put there name on this thing. It's to heavy to work with and to big to put any place."
3,"Useful, kind of","In theory this is a pretty useful tool for working by yourself. And it seems to work, as long as your not measuring up or along a wall. Seems that after about 4 feet the tape measure cant hold itself up against gravity. I happen to own a pretty thick tape measure that, while not automatic, extends further without an extra hand than this tool. All in all, if your not going up a wall, or along a wall, the tape measure works as advertised. I would guess it would be quite handy when working on a work bench or the floor."
2,not bad,I was surprised to find a better version available at Home Depot with laser included for the same price. I would have prefered that model .
4,B&D Auto Tape Comes in Handy,"This item works about 80% of the time, but there are times when you just need a second pair of hands! Is a Great father's Day gift!"
1,Run away!,This is another B&D blunder. Motor drive extends tape but does not retract. Battery door ill fitting. Can see it falling out at any moment. Not a serious tool for a contractor or weekend warrior. Get a laser measure instead.
1,Worthless Gimmick,"Worthless.What else can I really say. It is overweight, flimsy and there is no purpose to the motor drive... If they were free, I still would pay for a real tape measure instead. This is an overpriced paperweight."
2,tape measure,works well but to big and bulky for most work. ok for outside jobs but to hard to handle for small inside work. I don't use it to much because of it size. I would say buy only if using for outside work.
2,"Heavy, short, and flimsy","One word, heavy, describes the product. Not something to clip on your belt to carry all day. Given its size, was surprised only 25'. Have tapes twice as long that weigh half as much.Tried to measure a floor and by the time the tape got to the wall it curved so much that the measurement was useless. Thought this could be useful to do more with one person. There is a nice release on the bottom that recoils the tape w/o the battery."
1,Worst tool in my toolbox,"I got this as a gift. I seems like a good idea until you actually use it. The motor starts straining around the 36 inch mark and start to feel sorry for the poor motor at the 11 foot mark (it goes to 25 feet) where I have to stop. It would be one thing if it was easy to expand and retract the tape manually, but it's not. Oversized, overweight, underpowered. Don't waste your money."
2,Another great idea from Black and Decker...,"that is poorly executed and poorly made. This is a great idea, but all the flaws mentioned by other reviewers ( bulk, poor retraction) make this item more of a hinderence then a helpful tool.If you are thinking about buying this as a gift ( especially for a serious DIY person, craftsmen or tradesmen)... don't. Even a regular B&D; tape measure would be a better bet."
2,Black & Decker ATM100 25' Auto Tape Measure,"Black & Decker ATM100 25' Auto Tape MeasureOk... It's a fun toy. One of those gadgets to play with when bored. Too large, bulkey; heavy etc to be practical. Moy lowest rating ever for and Black and Decker product. Sorry!"
2,Great Idea but lots of perfection needed,"Being the first on the market I just had to have one. I like to buy everything new when it comes out. But man was I wrong to buy this right away. First, the motor is severely underpowered. Other reviewers have commented about it as well. It does conk out after about 3 feet and then requires the manual pull. Secondly the retract barely works. I mean I need to hammer my switch to get it to work. Third, this thing is huge and weighs a lot. I know its because of the motor and batteries, but still its too big.I own many Black and Decker tools and have been extremely satisfied over the years. This was a first attempt at a new product that didn't get as much testing as it needed. I'm sure that Black and Decker will try and improve this and make it better. It seems that everyone thats reviewed it has the same complaints. Have faith and trust in them to make it better over time!"
2,Nice Gimmick for once in a while home owner use........,[...]This is a nice gimmick but not for serious use. I can't see any serious contractor lugging this thing around LOL. I have fairly big hands and this thing is still bulky and clumsy. My wife got this for me for an xmas present and I don't have the heart to tell her it was a waste of money.If it was half the size it is then it would be easier to use/carry with you and then it might be worth it but not as is.
1,Trash can,"Underpowered to the point that it is practically unusable. I just put in fresh batteries, to make certain that the batteries were not a problem. I'm going to take out my new batteries, and throw this in the garbage. I could use it ""manually"" but it is way to heavy for that.Says ATM100 Type 2 on the label, so I think that this is the ""improved"" version."
4,elec tape measure,"This tool presents a real advantage to the user. Not only does it extend quickly, but it extends much further than expected without buckling."
4,Great for household projects,"If you are just looking for something to help with your ""honey-do list"" then this is a very nice tool. My husband has used it satisfactorily multiple times to hang pictures and wall decor. I would recommend this tool and so would my husband. It really helps when you need a third hand around to help with little projects!"
1,Don't waste your money,"As everyone says - its way too big and heavy for any practical use. The only problem I had with the motor was that it never worked at all - it was Dead On Arrival. This was good news though - now I won't have to make a show of using it for my in-laws, who gave it to me for x-mas."
1,Better door stop,"Biggest piece of juck on the market. It's heavy, the batteries go out fast and it's big. No one in the trades would use this on the job. Got mine as a gift and gave it to my wife for her little jobs around the house. Buy a real tape you will not be happy with this one."
1,Don't waste your money,"My husband received this as a Christmas gift from his parents and at first I thought it was one of those laser level things but then I took a second look and while let down I thought that this might be cool anyhow--but it's not. It's clunky, heavy, big, and kinda useless. It only extends about 3 feet before it goes ""limp"" and bends. It's not great for long distances. Also, when you extend it beyond 3 feet it sounds like the batteries are dying (maybe they are, but they are the new ones that came with it). I do think the little magnets on the right angle part on the end are a nice touch but they're not real strong so they don't grip/stick well. Plus, that wouldn't be real useful working with wood. Bottom line don't waste your money unless you have to have every gadget known to man."
3,Overlapping issues is annoying,"Why can't magazine publishers figure out that when you renew a subscription, you want it to begin when the current subscription runs out? It's really annoying & we probably also lose money when we receive double issues- like what's happening right now with my Entertainment Weekly subscription."
3,Fairly entertaining fluff with lots of double issues,"EW is a perfectly fine subscription (especially at the $15 price-point). It is colorful, entertaining, and an enjoyable read. I would have to take issue with the advertised 52 issues though. Through the first 8 issues I received - 3 were double issues. What it is closer to is 3 issues a month (with one being a double issue). So plan accordingly. For the first three months of my subscription (12 issues - I have received 9 magazines). It is a great value though so I would still recommend it at the price offered currently."
5,Can't live without it,"I subscribe to alot of magazines, but this is one of the 2 magazines that I can't live without. I am entertainment junkie. I love to read up on the celebrity news and teasers about upcoming movies and TV episodes. The perfect magazine for me."
1,"Good Mag, Awful service....",Bought a subscription for a year and received only around 6 magazines. Contacted customer service a few times with no use. I will never subscribe again and it's a shame cause it is a great magazine.
1,EW has lost it,"I used to enjoy receiving my copy of EW every week and read it cover to cover. Not anymore. I'm letting my subscription run out and will never look at its pages again. Gone are the witty, snarky reviews, interesting articles, and the full coverage of everything in entertainment. Now it plays obvious favorites, panders to whatever teenybopper flavor of the month is hip at the the moment, and pounds out articles with all the depth of shampoo instructions. All you have to do is look at EW's shameless boot-licking of that hack Stephenie Meyer and you'll see what I mean.I will not waste another dime on this rag."
1,Entertainment Weekly,It is unfortunate that I have never received my subscription to Entertainment Weekly. Amazon offered it at an amazing price and never followed through. How funny that they would ask for a review for an item they never sent me.
2,I don't get the weekly weekly,There are weeks I don't get the weekly. It doesn't come on time like they say it is suppous too
5,Students love it,"I ordered this for my junior high library, students and teachers love it - clean, well-written, and can't beat the price!"
4,To Me its One of a Kind,"I've been reading EW since issue one, and subscribed most of that time.Movie, TV, Music, and Books. My favorite mix in a weekly nugget. I somehow thought that auto-renewal would lock in a price, but I was mistaken."
2,Frustrating subscription problems!,"This has been a subscription nightmare. The magazine renewal was a Christmas gift for my niece, but instead they sent it to me. I had to go through Amazon to fix it, and the only way to do that was to do a change of address. They did start sending the magazine to my niece, but continued to send it to me as well, and I don't want it.In April my niece received a postcard advising her that she needed to return the postcard or else the magazine would stop. She sent back the postcard, but the magazine stopped anyway. Meanwhile, I am still getting it!The only reason I'm giving two stars is because my niece does like the magazine.I will never order another magazine through Amazon."
5,entertainment,"have enjoyed every content of this magazine,especialy the review of movies currant and past. i hope it continues for the next 2 yearsthe dialogue of the review of the books is outstanding. the TV movie guide is most helpful in planning my evenings."
3,It's ok.,I received this as a gift. It was ok. I renewed it for another year and I don't think I've looked at the last 5 or so. I also get OK mag and it's a little more gossip but maybe its the lack of time.
4,"Very clever, upbeat, savvy writers. Something good for everyone.","Entertainment Weekly (1 year)Going into my 5th subscription year, I'm not an audiophile, not a TV junkie, not a movie nut, not a Hollywood sycophant AT ALL. But my wife and I read a lot. EW is always received enthusiastically every Friday.It is some of the best quality writing to keep you amused and interested as well as in touch with the rest of the entertainment world. It's hip!....and that's from a 65-year-old-f**t. We get a heads-up on the best of the most recent fiction and non-fiction as well. We also get good film reviews and a comparison with critical opinions nation-wide. I subscribe to five quality magazines but always grab EW first. Enjoy."
4,Includes digital copy,The great thing about this magazine is that I can read the issues on my Nook. You can also get the digital copy on your Kindle. If you are looking for some interesting stories that you don't necessarily read about on the internet this is a good pickup. Well worth purchasing.
4,Good magazine.,I have receive my first two issues and I must that it is a good magazine for people who like to be updated about movies and tv. shows.Looking forward for next issues.
1,"Wayfair is awlful, Amazon great","I purchased this item on line, or so I thought. Wayfair sent me the top part of the fryer (pots) and not the stand and the propane hose with regulator. I thought it was a mistake and after many many e mails to Watfair the admitted the ad was a mistake and that they legally did not have to ship the complete unit. Unbelievable. What am I going to do with aluminum pots and without a fryer stand and hose for the propane tank? Amazon stepped in and resolved the issue, but I would not deal with Wayfair in the future. It would have been so easy to admit the error and ask me to pay a little extra for the stand, or just shipped it and completed the shipment keeping me happy.Thank you Amazon for resolving the problen with Wayfair."
3,Okay for the price,"Picture quality is a bit fuzzy, and it doesn't see a wide area, but you can't expect a lot from a webcam in this price range. The gooseneck is very convenient, and for a cheap camera, it gets the job done."
1,Not good for movement,"The update speed of this camera is horrible. Any movement at all results in a massive blur. Great camera for remote monitoring of potted plants. I returned it for a Logitech, which was at least usable if nowhere near as good as my MacBook's built-in camera."
2,web cam,I gave my first one to a relative and got a second one for myself. The second one does not work very well at all.
3,It works with Mac OS 10.4.6,"It works with OS10.4.6 without buying anything else, although you need install an attached driver in your computer. To the best of my knowledge, this is the most reasonable webcam for Mac users. The design of the webcam and the image quality are not that great, but I find it satisfactory to show your family/friends how well you look."
3,"Not bad, but doesn't work with iChat","You have to have a firewire camera to use iChat. Firewire is Apple's version of USB. Makes sense (in a way) that they would only want Firewire cameras to work with iChat. Shortsighted, stupid and ignorant too. But we are talking about Apple.I love my iBook. Best web browsing laptop out there. But finding peripherals or software that actually runs on it... Well, let's just say it is a challenge. For what it does, it does it flawlessly, without worms, or viruses or trojans.But this is still very shortsighted of Apple. The iBook works great with the camera, but not the software ON the thing. Sad.If you want a camera just to take pictures of yourself, this is not a bad thing. Not gonna replace the Nikkon, but if you're looking for iChat, look elsewhere."
2,Did not work for my MAC,it didnt work with my mac. i dont know why. it gave a black screeen after a couple of minutes of picture
4,Good for Skype,"This camera works well for Skype but as most if not all of you know, Ichat is a different beast all together, since I was looking for an inexpensive way to video conference via Skype I'm fairly happy w/ this but the picture quality isn't the greatest. At around $33.00 including shipping I cannot complain. Alls well that ends well.BlessingsRico"
1,not for old i-book,"I bought this hoping to use it with a hand me down i-book G3 with 800 mhz, osx 10.3.9. Didn't work. Got and sent sound over Skype. Got video but could not send. Any help out there?"
3,Works Fine,"This is about the only camera that works well with Apple computers. Since Apple discontinued the iSight camera, there are no firewire cameras available to use with iChat and Skype.Not a perfect like replacement for the iSight camera but functions adequately and is a good price."
1,You get what you pay for.,"The image quality was terrible. I think I could make out a silhouette of myself, but I couldn't even last 10 minutes before I disconnected the camera in disgust. You have to buy an extra piece of software to get this to work with iChat.The form is cool, but the utility... is not."
3,Good camera for the price,Camera works as advertised. It requires iChatUSBCam software to be usable with Mac OS X's iChat.
3,Good for the price,"I was surprise at the price, but for something that is temporary, less than a year, it is my price range. I'm not happy with the quality, I just thought I'd look better. I guess that's not the camera fault. The resolution is a bit grainer than I'd like. The easy of use is good. I have an old Mac G4 laptop and can tuck this little camera in the backpack I use to tote my computer stuff around and it does well. I do recommend it for the price, portability and easy of use.Kym"
1,not that good,quality is not good.but you can see the persondo not recommend this one.Blurry but you do see the person somewhat...
3,So-so cam,"As a webcam it's pretty good. Especially for its price. However, if you are hoping to use it on a Mac with iChat, then you have to be careful. It will not function with iChat without a separate program that you have to pay extra for. This isn't labeled on the box or in most advertisements, so heads up.It's just a couple of bucks for the extra software and they do let you use a demo for seven or so days before you have to buy."
3,Macally Portable Web Cam,"A family member is moving out of state so she gave a webcam to my kids to keep in touch. Of course it wasn't compatible since I have a Mac. I returned it and started my search for one that would work on my computer. After many hours of research, it came down to an isight for $149 or a Macally for $30. I chose the Macally.I'll admit that the picture isn't the greatest but I installed it without any trouble at all and it works just fine. My kids were having a ball taking snapshots of themselves and it was very easy for them to use. I would recommend this camera for people who just want a webcam and don't need to have a ""top of the line"" camera. For the price, this camera is definitely worth it."
2,Not great video,"It is great that this product is under 80 dollars and works for the mac. However the picture quality is low, the speed isn't great and it has a problem adjusting to light in any situation."
3,Good camera but EXTRA SOFTWARE PURCHASE REQUIRED FOR MAC USE,"This is a great little camera and a good value for what you get. That said, if you have a Mac, you MUST *BUY ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE*. It should only be $5, but this isn't stated anywhere on the packaging - you may figure this out only after troubleshooting why it won't work with iChat/Skype. A good value for a little flexible, portable camera, but be aware that there's an additional cost involved."
2,Spend a little more!,"To the reviewer who wasn't able to see his own image, I recommend turning on the light in the room :o)Pic is fine on my iBook G4 running OX 4, but camera crashes Yahoo msg constantly, even with the 5USD downloadeddriver from macally!Manual is useless - only tells you that you can have other people view your image online.Duh! What a shockingly innovative feature for a webcam? :opNext time I will probably spend a little more and get a cam that will work properlywith Mac."
2,macally webcam on a mac?,This camera works OK with Macintosh only after purchasing additional software. This is not made clear in the specificatiions given. I'd have given it a higher rating if this fact was included in the advertising.
4,Not bad,"I just bought one and am very pleased. I am a Mac user and its very difficult to find one that works well. Set up was amazingly easy, and the picture isn't too bad. It does not like differences in light, but you the picture is okay. Definitely useable for basic communication and whatnot. It does not have a microphone in it, which I just didn't even realize when I bought it. Not a big deal though, as opposed to paying for the iSight, springing for a microphone isn't too big a deal."
1,Do Not Buy This Webcam,I gave a one star to this item only because I couldn't give a lower rating than that. The image quality is very very bad. We decided to return it in just the first half hour we started using it. It doesn't work properly with yahoo messenger and the image quality is very bad in skype.
3,It does it's job,A little grainy but not that bad. For the price it is good. I bought mine for my G4 and all other cameras for the mac are really expensive. I just wish it had a built in microphone. But overall it is an average buy.
1,DON'T BUY FROM ANT-ONLINE,I never received my purchase and AntOnline couldn't give me a refund or offer me a new one. They blamed it on the mail carrier. In any case I called and emailed (was no phone number for Ant ONline) everyone possible and no one wanted to help me. I will never buy from Ant Online again!!
1,Absolutely get what you pay for....BULLOCKS,"I should have saved my 30 some bucks and bought a MIDI in out recorder for my iBOOK for the midi controller as this is a piece of unmittigated JUNK. It's a TERRIBLE picture even with chuffin' professional lighting on it.My advice is go with an Isight, it's expensive and MAC cameras are WAY more expensive than PC cameras HOWEVER they're are a couple of very nice ones floating around for 50 bucks or so, this piece of metal should be floating in me loo, that's for sure, or, it would make some sort of intresting necklace or bracelet.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT it SUX like a STRAWER FACTORY"
3,ICECAM,"Based on the previous reviews, I got what I expected. Its a reasonable product, especially if you want a cheap MAC webcam. The picture quality isn't great, but it works fine with Yahoo messenger. If you're looking for something short term, this is probably better than spending a lot of money on the other expensive MAC webcams."
4,"poor picture, great value","Everything is great about this item except the picture, which is good enough if you're simply seeking an entry level camera."
3,editing needed,"Uncommon Grounds is an entertaining easy read. Just what I expected. I wish, however, the author would take the time to remove the myriad annoying hyphens throughout the book. It does disturb the flow and sense of immersion in the story because it draws attention from the narrative to the type. Proof reading, anyone?"
1,False Advertising,"The battery is advertised as Nickel Medal Hydride. The battery you actually get is Nickel Cadmium. This is an older technology that has less battery life and charge cycles. By the time you pay shipping, just go to a Makita dealer an official Makita battery. Never again."
1,"Very, very confusing!","To tell you the truth, I couldn't make heads nor tails out of this book. The language is too far away from even modern, and the characters are confusing. I love sci-fi, even the new computer-oriented (some call it cyberpunk) stuff like ""Snow Crash"", but ""Synners"" is just strange. Ala the Emperor's New Clothes...""Oh my, how strange! It must be good!"" No, sorry, it's just strange. I actually came here (to Amazon reviews) to see if anybody else had made sense of it. I thought I might read farther if I understood it better. I'm only to page 18, and I doubt I'll finish it.Doug"
4,Not a full tang sword,"This replica is everything you see in the pictures, but nothing more. It is a great deal but not an outstanding weapon. It has a 440 stainless blade made in China, So not so great for a sharp edge, a reasonably comfortable handle and it looks great. The blade is connected through the handle with the standard bolt system given away by the cut in the hand guard. Its hear, its metal and it will look great in my costume, and no candy swipers will dare touch my candy :) (ha ha)The nylon sheath it comes with has a belt loop and an additional strap to go over your shoulder that is in line with the blade. It is surprisingly thicker then I would have expected with nice snaps for a secure hold on the blade."
5,I agree but...,"The above reviewer nails it but... with 24 bit remastering, ace sequencing, a mid-line price, and lovely packaging you can't beat this comp.The sequencing flows like a classic album, studio and live tracks, ballads and frenzied numbers. This is a beatnik be-bopper, hipster, flipsters dream come true. In fact all of the Savoy timeless series seem pretty choice, a lot of thought seems to have gone into the production from the first post-it note through the end ""product"". If you get this and the Charlie Parker timeless comp. You will have almost two hours of unbeatable be-bop for a [small price]. I'm tellin' you this be the sh!t!!"
3,"Unfortunate, but very good potential","Sophie has a nice voice, it's just a shame that in this album, she barely makes use of it. Untie Me is a collection of poetic love letters, recited by Sophie, under beautiful musical scores by Ives. But as music, roughly three songs from the album feature the singer actually singing. Indeed, it would be possible to random play the songless tracks and, if it weren't for Ives' master soundwork, be difficult to tell them apart.However, in the pieces where she does sing, the harmony between the two artists truly shines; such is the case for Big Healing, Clouds, and the last part of Awaken.Bottom line, If they were to ever make another album, and Sophie decided to fully use her vocal talent, I believe the harmony brought forth by their love would be one of the most entrancing pieces in ambient music."
5,From Back Cover,"Bob Hope joins forces with the legendary Ginger Roger and funnyman Jerry Colonna to spread holiday cheer in a Bob Hope Chevy Show that was originally broadcast in December of 1956.Plus - a real Christmas rarity: Sherlock Holmes & The Case of the Christmas Pudding, a live drama from 1954 starring distinguished British actor Ronald Howard, who also made memorable appearances in such television classics as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Thriller, and One Step Beyond.As a special free bonus, there's the audio CD, Happy Holidays, featuring favorite Christmas songs from such performers as Liberace, Vic Damone, and the Harry Simeone Chorale.1.

God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen11. Deck The Halls12. O Come All Ye Faithful13. Silent Night14. What Child Is This15. O Holy Night"
4,Great satire,"These cards are a great piece of satire. Thankfully we live in a country where we're free to praise, parody and criticize our government in the manner of our own choosing."
3,Funny,"These are definitely great for a laugh. They may be tasteless, but so were the ""Iraq's Most Wanted"" cards, and I think that's part of the point. It's a clever way to poke fun at a very baffling--though very creative--bit of military strategy in the war with Iraq ('cause whatever your feelings on the war, you have to admit the playing card idea was a bit unusual), as well as the standard poke-fun-at-Bush aspect. Is it a great achievement in political satire? Not really. But it is amusing, possibly even amusing enough to be worth $7.95."
2,A little pointless,"Okay, the whole ""Bush is a criminal"" thing is an overused and rather trite ""viewpoint"". However, it doesn't really mean I support his administration. That said, as ""cute"" as this novelty is, it's ultimately just a bit lacking in purpose. The thing that's surprised me most about this is just the viewer reactions. Apparently, everyone seems to think they're under legal obligation to buy or enjoy everything Amazon recommends to them, when in fact no one even forced them to click the link. The sum of the detractors' argument seems to be ""Stop forcing me to click this link."" and ""Liberals liberals liberals liberals liberals. I'm not saying anything really, I'm just throwing around the word 'liberals' to mean 'people I dislike'."" I thought this was about reviewing products, not about reviewing people."
1,I can't believe Amazon would sell and promote this,I think the product is horrible. And I will buy my books in the future from Bamm.com
1,It is a dangerous world.,How sad and ironic that people consider their leaders madmen and warmongers for the offense of protecting them from true madmen and murderers. P.T. Barnum was right. There's a sucker born every minute.
1,DISGUSTING,"This is absoultely ridiculous ... how can amazon actually post this on their site ..... Dearest Mr. Bezos: Either your unamerican or completely unaware and oblivious to what's being sold on amazon -- whichever the case is, you've lost another customer to BarnesAndNobles.com"
1,Only cause there aren't negative stars...,"Whoever created these cards, really has no sense of patriotism or pride in their country or it's elected officials."
1,thousandreasons.org,Apparently most reviewers equate patriotism with believing everything that's said by a politician rather than thinking for themselves.I'm glad George W. Bush and his father are making a killing in oil profits from the deaths of so many.
1,Great claptrap gift for simpleton lefties,"These cards will have great appeal for those that don't feel they are liberal unless the hate the Republican Party.Equating the Bush administration to the Saddam regime is small-minded, and a sure sign of an intellectual coward. These cards are great for hate, but bad for debate.Only buy them for the most closed minded liberals. Anyone else should have enough patriotism to throw them back at you."
2,maybe i just don't get it.,but why is this band so loved? the only part of this i even cared for is the opening track and that little part with the drums coming in over the robot gal or whatever talking. that was pretty neat i guess.
4,MI-5 Season 6,Another season of entertaining spy adventures. MI-5 does an exceptional job of weaving action and drama about many current world events. Not as action packed as a 24 show but much more believeable.
5,sitting on the edge of my seat!,"Adventuresome,exciting and never can a person take a scene for granted. Just when you think you know what's coming, it will change."
5,Addictive!,"Rupert Penry-Jones makes the whole show worth watching. One of the hardest series I have ever watched to not say ""Just one more episode!"" at midnight when I know I should be turning in for bed... I love British crime dramas and this is probably the best I've seen yet!"
1,Too Expensive--Not worth it,The $80 cost of this DVD is ridiculous. We love this series and have seen all of the prior episodes but no way would we pay $80 for Season 6!!!! I would recommend that you rent this from your local library. They do not charge and they order almost all BBC material and certainly will have this. Amazon should wake up and price this more reasonably.
1,I will wait for a price reduction!,"I have both Volume 5 and 6 in my cart waiting for a price reduction. In the meantime I also have it in my queue at Netflix. I love the series, but cannot afford to own the set at the current prices."
1,mi 5 series 6,"sorry, cannot review this product. it will not play in dvd.australian area/zone not compatable.will possibly not order future dvd's because of this happening again."
4,A more economical option for MI-5 fans,"If you have a region-free DVD player, this title is actually cheaper to order from Amazon UK (under its original name of ""Spooks""): 25.98, or about $39 at current exchange rates. By the way, Inspector Morse videos are much cheaper at Amazon UK as well.That being said, I am looking forward to Series 6. Each series has gotten edgier and more unpredictable, and the online synopses that I've seen indicate that this series will be no exception."
1,Price escalation,I am in agreement with other posts - this price is absurd. I would suggest we all stand firm and resist ordering at such a price. Someone at Amazon has to be listening!
4,"good program, to much $$$","this is a good series, lots of intrigue.... but who can pay so much??? not me. I will wait till the price is more affordable."
2,Over the top anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism,I have absolutely loved the series up until now. While there was always some irrational hatred of Americans and vicious racism this volume takes it to an entirely new level. In one of the episodes the Americans are supposedly going to assassinate a genocidal dictator on British soil. The moral equivalency is disgusting. To the writers the killing of someone like Hitler is just as evil as blowing up a school full of children. In this series every single problem of the world is either the Americans fault or Israels. It never could be the people whose lives only meaning are to kill the infidels.I sure hope season 7 gets back to some rationality.
3,A very painful book to read,"Mama, Let's Dance is a wonderfully written book, but the topic is so serious and so painful that it would be hard for me to introduce this book to my students. Three children abanoned by both of their parents, one of whom is alive but doesn't care about them, struggle to survive and stay together. The children are faced with starvation and death. Is there any hope? Can children find nothing but despair and hopelessness after reading this book?"
4,"Mama, Let's Dance","This book is about three kids: Ariel, Callie, and Mary Bell. About six weeks ago their mama left them them alone. She left them only 50.00 because that's all she could afford. Soon, Callie gets sick, really sick and is taken to the hospital. She doesn't make it and Mary Bell is so upset! I loved this book and I encourage you to read it!"
4,A winner on high pressure bike tires,"I purchased this electric pump to use in the inflation of high pressure bike tires with the very hard to use presta valves. I've never found a pump that works well on these valves no matter how much money I'd spend. It is difficult to even measure the pressure in the tire because no one makes gauges and with adapter on valve, regular gauge doesn't work.This pump works well. I initially had problems but now ok. It reaches 85lbs of psi quickly and then seems to labor a bit. As far as working on Schrader valves, no problems.The pump is well made, small enough and comes with a durable carrying case. I feel this pump is reasonably priced at about $50 and I recommend it for bike tire use."
3,Screw-on attachment hose is hard to use,"The pump works fine, as expected, however the screw-on attachment is very clumsy to use - while screwing it on/off a lot of air comes out, so that it's hard to tell at the end what pressure ended up in the tire. I've used a pump from an auto road kit (Costo) with a snap-on attachment, which was very fast to put on, and take off -- I liked it much better. Also the thing is HEAVY for its size!"
5,Great pump for the price,IO bought this pump because I have about 50 soccer balls that constantly need air. It works great and it was cheaper compared to many other pumps. Only thing is to watch for it getting the motor a little hot if you pump up more than 30 balls at a time. Other than that great pump - great price.
3,It is fragile,This pump is light weight and powerful. However the plastic housing around the switch broke off after two years.
2,PICTURES NOT IN COLOR,"I was really exicted about getting this book for my 8 year old son afer reading the reivews. When I got it, I was not all that excited. None of the pictures are in color and it doesn't seem all that engaging to read. I would have preferred a different book but will still give it to my son with his new telescope. Hopefully he will enjoy it."
4,Lots of stories too,"Aside from showing you how to find night sky constellations, it is filled with lots of cool stories from mythology, etc."
2,Cover Deceiving,"Wish I had seen the older reviews which mentioned the fact that the pages are black and white. The cover gives you the impression that this is a very colorful book, so, along with other reviewers, I was very disappointed in the drab pages. Most children appreciate bright illustrations. I would not have ordered this book, in spite of good reviews, if I had been aware of this. I'm writing this review hoping since it is newer, it will be more prominent."
5,A Great Overview,I highly recommend this volume for its breadth of coverage as an intro or a refresher. It enables the reader to get many of th ebasisc to use as a springboard to a further analysis of the philospohers one desires to read in greater detail. I am now reading Vol. 2.
4,Most Faithful to the Legend,"Yes, Disney took their time releasing the DVD version. It isn't technically the best version of Robin Hood, and the interaction of Robin and Marion is obviously aimed at children in the 50's, but it is the most faithful rendition of the legend of all the versions out there as well as of the reason the legend caught on. Peter Finch is excellent, and Richard Todd's impish charm was expertly cast."
4,Quality Robin Hood,"I've seen a lot of Robin Hood movies. I've seen him as the Earl of Huntingdon and as a peasant. I've seen Saracens and sorcery added to the mix. This story keeps closer to the tales than most and adds a believable historical context with Queen Elinore of Aquitaine trying to put together Richard's ransom. Some of the battles, especially the finally, are tepid but overall this is a worthwhile edition."
4,Heartwarming Revisit,"I read the story of Robin Hood at age 11, and enjoyed the 1938 film with Errol Flynn at his swashbuckling best. But the Disney-produced version brought warm remembrance and once again left me smiling. The story is true to the written legend, but told with an upbeat style that is memorably supported by a singing minstrel. Richard Todd portrays a likeable Robin, and his cohorts - including Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, Little John, and the rest of the outlaw band - seem more into perpetrating mischief against evil Prince John and his minions than committing acts of hateful revenge. I loved the film when I first saw it in 1952, and I still love it."
5,My Favorite Movie,"This movie is absolutely wonderful. I've always loved it. Too bad it is nolonger available. Richard Todd, Joan Rice and the rest of the cast are great. The movie is so innocent and still entertaining. It is a classic all the way around!"
2,Robin Hood,This movie was shared with agroup of tenth graders after reading the book. They were not too impressed with it because they felt it was too old. Much of what we read in the story was dfferent from the video and they noticed the difference.
1,Story of Robin Hood,"I was very disappointed with the dvd sent to me as I cannot play it on my dvd player or my laptop as it is not the right region for Australia.I believe the dvd did come from an outlet in New Zealand, but that didn't make any difference and I still haven't been able to view the dvd.RegardsLinda"
3,"Terrific movie, poor DVD","Next to the Errol Flynn version, this is probably the best one I've seen. The acting is uniformly terrific and the dialogue is smartly written, even a bit dense for children. However I can only imagine the picture looks great because...the DVD quality stinks! For a major studio release, this is one of the worst-looking transfers I've ever seen. It looks like a 2nd generation VHS recording, the colours are faded and the picture clarity is muted at best. To top it off, there are NO chapters! If you stop halfway through, as I did, you have to fast forward from the beginning to get to the spot you left off at. Disney should be ashamed!"
3,Very disappointed!!!,"I love this movie, and was delighted it had been put on a DVD. However, after watching it, I was disappointed to discover the picture quality was well below the VHS. With poor color, and the focus on images consistently blurred, I will probably throw out my purchase and go back to watching the VHS."
4,A forgotten gem,"While no rendition of the Robin Hood tale matches the Errol Flynn version, this one comes close. Told in the style of the classic Disney live-action films, Richard Todd's Robin comes to life on the screen. The strolling minstrel uniquely weaves the segments of the story together with his narrative songs. This is truly a family film. Highly enjoyable."
1,High contrast in opinions in the household on this one.,"We all love Clifford.That said, the adults hide this book after a few dozen ""reads"". The kid loves this book. Tons of objects with labels. But it is real tiresome for the reader. Big boredom. There's only so many ways you can invent plots for this one. It's almost as bad as a sound toy that doesn't have an off switch, volume control, or fun concept."
2,cheep but pre wound,i was looking for a nice pre wound spool for my weed whacker to save time but when i put in the spool it jamed in the first 5 min of whacking and had to re wind the whole spool to get it to un jam
4,Twisted,"The plot was good, acting was great, and the film was well shot.But plausibility was lost as Emma fell too far into the realm of crazy obsessive overbearing stalker."
5,Rome: A Fold-Out History of the Ancient Civilization,The popout illos are wonderful. This is a great tool for teaching. A good way to get young people interested in ancient lifeways and culture.
3,Sidelong Glances of a Pigeon Kicker,Sidelong Glances of a Pigeon KickerSidelong Glances of a Pigeon KickerThis movie actually has the reissue title Pigeons on the title card and is a full 15 minutes shorter than the original release. There are no extras added. But it is a rarelt seen film until now under any name and length. My rating is for the reduced length for which there is no explanation. I have not seen the film at this point in time.
2,Poor performance on thick grass,"Does not work anywhere near as well as the shears it replaced, which were of similar design. If the grass is thick at all, these shears will not cut through it."
2,they break,I have gone through about three of these shears now. What ends up happening is a little white piece of plastic inside breaks. This happens if you are over zealous and forcefully cut through a little too much grass at once. Gilmour has been nice enough to send out replacements in the past. They just broke again the other day. I am shopping around for an all metal shear now. They were good when they worked. The lightweight was appreciated.
4,Episode list is wrong,"On the first disc there are supposedly these episodes (per inlay and disc menu)They claim the first three episodes are:The Other LongoWaiting for Mr. RightJoe KnowsAll Politics Is Local...When in fact it is:Enemies with BenefitsThe Other LongoWaiting for Mr. RightAll Politics Is Local....""Joe Knows"" was the last episode of the ""Season 1: Part 1"" package."
5,sharps hand needles,Great value from a great product company. My favorite Hand sewing needles. I use these for piecing and I use their betweens for hand quilting.
2,"Exciting, but too much of the same stuff...","Who doesn't like doing 'it' outside in the open air? A complete collection of short stories is here to prove that it really is great fun.But after reading a few of these well written stories, you get a feeling of déjà-vu. First some oral fun and then finishing with a session of anal action. It always seems to be the same scenario.So, if you do not care for a touching story-line in between the sex scenes: this is what you have to put on your bookshelf. It doesn't get much better than this. But if you're a sucker for some exciting -and still hot- story (like me) then do not spend any money on this.Oh, by the way, quite a lot of bare backing going on in this collection. I wander if this is really necessary. Some good stories have proven that putting a condom on isn't that distracting, so...Have fun and play it safe!"
4,"Does what it should, can't beat the price.","I am a heavy user of a face shield as I wear glasses and a face shield keeps them from fogging up. I go through a lot of shields due to drops, paint splatters, general use,etc. This is a solid shield and much cheaper than anywhere else. At this price, you could not cut the poly and drill it yourself any cheaper."
3,Dog Escapes,"After a year with this system and new batteries every month, I am frustrated. Both are medium-sized dogs.One dog never goes out, but runs the border constantly. The other dog runs through the border (even on high voltage with a big warning boundary) or stands at the warning boundary until the batteries go dead (the collar beeps before it shocks) and then escapes. A no win situation. Although they don't escape as much as they used to, still I have to go in the neighborhood to find him, and he gets raw spots on his neck from the shocks he receives. Not for stubborn dogs !"
4,juggling clubs,"i asked for 2 sets of duncan juggling clubs, expecting that both were much alike the ones shown in the picture, but the ones i got were different, one of the sets had a stamp of an image of flames, not all flamed at the bottom as shown, and the other set was a white set, with a funny face of the duncan brand, that was not what i asked for, anyways, the clubs were for a gift so i couldnt ask for a refund or for you to change the items, thnx anyways"
4,Fun,Work just fine and is fun. Just need the time to get good at using them. And need to keep away from the Dog!
3,"The clubs are decent, but they sent a different color","And there certainly wasn't any way of knowing that instead of getting that neat black and yellow pattern that I'd get a much more boring white club with black tape and the Duncan logo on it. Suffice to say I'm disappointed with that bit. Especially with the blurb in the description talking about the cool graphics.But yeah, as long as I'm just learning club juggling I suppose it isn't that big of a deal. If I keep going I'll eventually get better flashier clubs anyway."
2,not as pictured,"bought these and everything is great accept the clubs were not as they appear in the picture. Instead of yellow with black flames, they were white and red with a dorky little duncan kid for the logo. Clubs are durible and I am learning with them - but if I ever get good enough to juggle clubs in public, I will have to buy new ones. I feel ripped off."
4,Gets the job done,"I watched the video and it took me about 2 weeks to get the idea. The ends really hurt when you drop them on your foot, its hard plastic. They do get scuffed, but they will not crack when you drop them 200 times."
5,Great exercise toy for any age.,"These clubs are just what I wanted. Something brightly colored and durable I could safely use to toss around and learn how-to juggle. My agility and hand-eye coordination is slowly improving with each use. I am not the best juggler (in-training), but I am the happiest. Thank You"
4,Good polio retrospective,"From long experience with this area, Mee's accounts both of the era of his youth and the experiences of polio ring very true from the pen of an accomplished writer. One senses that Mee never really made peace with his disability and its impact, inasmuch as he was able to evade, compensate, head into intellectual endeavors, etc., so there are many polio/disability issues not well dealt with here. (Significantly it ends with his finding an oasis in the intellectual world of the Ivy League and the intellect.) However, one has to suspect that the decision to tell the story, with insight and honesty, may represent at long last a step in addressing what he may have hoped at one time to simply ""leave behind."" Perhaps there will be a sequel in which his historical training and writing skills are again focused on the complex interrelationships between disability, psyche and society. This is a good read, though, even if it is not the full story."
4,Heart-warming. Unique costumes,Picked up this movie over the holidays and enjoyed it. A heart-warming movie suitable for the entire family. Interesting costuming-- watch-out for the fruitcake!
1,One of the worst,"Predictable plot, horrible acting, totally formulaic. A total waste of time. The ""bad guys"" are over the top bad and the ""good guys"" are so sugar sweet that I felt like I needed some insulin. It's supposedly in the mountains at Christmas time but they apparently used some back lot location for a show set in the summer because there are leaves on all of the trees and summer flowers are blooming all over the place. THe characters don't even bother to pretend it's cold outside and in some scenes one character will be in a t-shirt while another will be in a coat and scarf. And naturally the final scene has the prerequisite cheesy snowfall. It's like a movie put together by a bunch of teenagers for a school project.There's two hours of my life I'll never get back!"
4,movie review,"Good movie. Things work out as they should in the end. Great song, ""Are You Coming Home for Christmas?""."
2,Poor Film,"Good story line, but the actors have to be related to one of the investors, cause they were really hard to relate to. I give it two stars because they had some really great music and a couple of good supporting cast. Do yourself a favor and pay 2.99 and watch it on line. Merry Christmas"
4,Cute family movie,"As a collector of Christmas movies, I had to purchase this for the family. It has a basic theme and the usual conflicts of most movies. The acting was nice, but not spectacular. Tom Arnold is a ham, but a lovable one in his few scenes. It is just right for a winter movie fest and the family always enjoys the night. I recommend it for collectors of Christmas movies, but for any who love a gentle, predictable, movie."
3,easy watching,"It is easy watching. But very slow. A Hallmark Channel type movie, but I've seen many of those and this was not my favorite."
1,Don't waste your time ...,"... on this movie, and spend it with family members and/or friends instead. You could tell each other better stories than this one, I bet. This two hour-ish tale could have easily been told in 5 minutes or less. I suppose it could be on the TV as background video while decorating the house for the holidays, wrapping presents, or cooking holiday desserts or meals."
3,Not Great,"This movie was just okay. I like Tom Arnold in other Christmas movies, but he wasn't really in this very much at all. Overall, the actors in this movie seemed like they were trying too hard, which made it feel stiff."
2,A Christmas Proposal ---,"We were honestly a little disappointed in the movie, altho it was in good quality, and we appreciate your promptness."
1,SNES game,I remember this game as a game i used to play at the arcade when i was younger. I was never aware that it was sold for the Nintendo deck as well. I was so happy to come across it in my search for oler Nintendo games. When i recieved it i found that it has really bad graphics even for an 8-bit game. It is very hard to control the charachter as he always gets stuck when climbing stairs and other obstacles. The arcade version was one of my all time favorites. I spent many hours and a good portion of my allowance playing the arcade version. But i dont recommend this version of the game to anyone.
4,The worst game I've ever played.,"I rented this thinking it would be similar to Mario Party and was very sorely disappointed. If I had bought this game I would have freaked out, because even the 6 bucks I spent on renting it was a total waste. The mini-games were nonsensical and the opposite of fun: tedious. No explanations, no apparent point to the game, stupid graphics. I'm surprised Nintendo is putting their name on this crap. Don't buy this game! Buy Mario Party 5 instead."
1,"One Word, Rental","This game is definitely not worth the $30 I paid for it. I bought the game after reading some fairly good reviews and thinking that it would be similar to Mario Party. I also thought it would be a good party game, but none of my friends enjoyed playing this game.Every game is about 3 seconds at the longest, and none of them have an explanation other than one word, such as ""DODGE"". 200 games seems like a lot of fun action, but none of them are really fun. Here's a typical game: A bar is dropped, and you have to catch it by hitting ""A"" at the right time. No explanantion other than one word such as ""CATCH"", and the game is over in 2 seconds. You either catch it or you don't, then on to the next game.If you have Attention Deficit Disorder and enjoy playing 10 pointless games within 30 seconds, this game is for you. If you are considering buying this game. I highly suggest you rent it first."
1,worst game ever played,I was utterly disappointed with this game. I would give it 0 stars if I could but the lowerst rating is one star. don't wast your money. I would rather get a root canal done than buy this game. Luckily I rented it for free so i don't feel completly cheated.
1,C'mon. this game would have been cool in 1991.,"I bought it to play with my little niece and nephew, but I was disappointed. The game is not a game. Its tens of little ""games"" that have horrible graphics and last 3 seconds. They are pointless and confusing."
2,I do not recommend buying this game.,"This game was a total waist of money! It only took me a day to beat! The mini-games aren't that fun. I bought it two weeks ago and I am already sick of it! However, I gave it two stars because of its multiplayer mode which is good. I do not recommend buying this game."
1,This game stinks,"This game stinks...it took 20 mins to play through the whole game. And each ""game"" is only 3 seconds long."
3,Sprack 12 opinion,"This game is very fun , when it's your first time at play. The 2nd time around not so much , Multiplayer gives some extra reply some . This game still is fun and will give you and a friend about 5 hours of fun , then it runs flat . Definitely then worth the $ 18 I paid at amazon new shipped. I think the Wii's Wario Smooth Moves offers more fun and none of games say game boy advance on them. This title will offer over 200 fast react games about 5 seconds each and a boss at the end of every 25 levels."
5,Lets party!,"All right!Wario is back with over 200 Minigames,new 4-player connectivity,and more!It's going to be better than the first!Yeah!Let's party!"
3,Boston The Way It Was,"Nice visit to days gone by in Boston and Revere Beach Massachusetts. Wonderful memories and commentary by people who were there. Most enjoyable to senior citizens who remember the ""old days"". Not enough pictures, and although the ""talking heads"" were charming and lovable, we would have appreciated more visuals of our beloved old city, especially more old footage of Faneuil Hall and Revere Beach Boulevard.A good effort, and worth seeing. Lets have more of this sort of thing."
3,Boston The Way it Was Volume One,"This is an enjoyable look back at Boston in the ""bad""old days. Especially enjoyed seeing Revere Beach Boulevard and Scollay Square. Would have liked more visuals. The ""talking heads"" were charming and lovable, but more footage of places like Faneuil Hall and the North End would have been appreciated. Especially appropriate for senior citizens and natives of Boston with need of a nostalgic experience."
5,Great Value for Right Buyer,"Used 18 mos. without problems. Lightweight and compact for a 15"" screen = easy travel/moving around house. Battery life average, occasional lock-ups due to ISP. Usage 50/50 wifi surfing vs. business(word/PP/excel). For someone with similar needs this computer is a 5 star great buy. Like any product it's only a great buy for the right applications. Lack of dedicated video ram, inexpensive video components, basic 256K ram, processor speed, 1024 screen make this a bad ""2 star"" fit/value for the wrong buyer. For business, surfing, carrying-around its great. Those with game, design, and video focus should look elsewhere."
3,Not a bad laptop,"I've had all the same problems. My laptop kept shutting down, but I soon discovered why. First, I had mixed memory. For some reason, the two memory sticks didn't work well together and it caused my computer to lock up. If you buy this laptop, be sure to upgrade your memory with the same manufacturer. Also, laptops are not able to cool themselves off as easily as a desktop can. There is too much equipment in too confined a space. Mine shut off when it was too hot. You should be glad rather than angry. I'd rather lose a bit of information than lose my computer. Anyway, this problem was easily solved as well. You can go to any Target and purchase a platform that has two little fans in it. Your laptop sits right on top of it and it will not overheat again. All things considered, this is a decent laptop. If you really want to do some gaming, however, you may want to shop around a bit more. I suggest alienware."
1,Terrible,"This machine has a large variety of problems since we purchased it 18 months ago. It freezes often, and the dvd player stopped working about 3 months after we got it. The power input jack came loose, and while wiggling around the cord in an attempt to mak a connection, teh computer suffered a small internal fire. DO not purchase."
2,just say no,"I have had this computer for over a year and I have had nothing but problems. It locks up the whole time I use it, it shuts down with no warning (and does not automatically save your work). It is nice that it has a wireless card slot, but can barely use it ~ the heat sinc gets to hot and shuts off the wireless card.I am sure that there is more!I would recommend this system!"
2,arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgg!!!,"This computer locks up on me all the time!! Multiple- we're talking more than 5 on bad days- times a day. I don't know if it is just my computer that has a problem or what, but it is really frustrating. Today it has locked up over and over again. It has also happened (not today, but sometimes) that the computer will just turn itself off. Just like that. No goodbyes. No kiss on the cheek. Nothing. Kaput. I want to smash my computer."
2,"The ""lightning"" books are really poor","The new series of reprints of Chaosium's works really are poor! The are effectively photocopies of the original, and fail to reproduce both color as well as the solidity of the originals. Comparing the new to the old, you immediately realize that this is an inferior product. These can be spotted immediately by examining the back of the book for a black logo of an open book with a lightning bolt hitting it in the spine.Stay away!All of the reprints of Chaosium's works are like this, including the Stars are Right!, Blood Brothers, and others.... *sigh* I am obviously a disappointed customer."
2,Not original edition but a copy,"This version appears to be a copy of the original second edition. The large map is missing and there are no colored plates.If you just want the information this is okay, but if you wanted the artwork, you'll have to look elsewhere."
3,Waterford Salt and Pepper Shakers,"The Waterford crystal is beautiful in its simplicity. Long flowing lines with smaller bevel shaped indentations between the lines. The shakers are one continuous smooth shape, with no jagged edges. The opening at the bottom is large and easy to fill or clean. The only drawback is the one opening at the top. The opening is large enough so too much salt or pepper comes out when using it. It is necessary to be very careful, or the meal will be saturated with salt or pepper. There is a constant need to remind guest of the problem."
2,Incorrect replacement part,The part sent was not the correct replacement part. The return was easy b ut I gave up trying to order the correct part after several trys.
4,Very Useful,"The razor planer is indispensable for building balsa model airplanes. It's really the only practical way to shape the leading edges of wings and other surfaces. This particular model is exactly like one my father had several years ago. It's a bit tricky at first, because you have to adjust the blade depth to take off the right amount of material. Start shallow, and increase the depth gradually until you achieve the desired result. The adjustment is easy, but you have to eyeball the blade to measure the depth. I don't know of any other products that do what this does. Fortunately, this one does a fairly good job."
2,"Disney, you need to throw away the scissors.","Love the Movie but Disney has to stop cutting. STOP IT, STOP IT STOP IT! I do not understand why they do it so please STOP CUTTING! It helps no one especially the customer, and we pay the bills. Thank you!"
2,The first mistake is buying this book!,I read this book with the expectation that I might learn something new or learn it in a new way. I found the matieral unimpressive in comparision to other work on sales i.e. Brian Tracy or Zig Ziggler. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!W. Harrison Childers
5,Interesting consept,"I really liked this book becuase it had an interesting twist. Instead of telling you want to do the author tells you want not to do. You learn how to avoid the common pit falls that sale people seem to falls in. Nice work!Ty Wilde""Everything I Touch Turns to Sold (Advice on How to Become a Top Sales Professional From a Top Producer)"""
3,Useful book for the working salesperson,This is a cheaply made book. It's not very longeither.It's okay. Maybe it's better than ok. The sameinformation is covered in a more long-winded fashionin other books about selling.Some books that are meant to be sold at seminars arereally fluffy stuff. This one isn't. It's practicaladvice. It's organized in short chapters you canread really fast.
2,Very wide,"I have a narrow foot, but usually can wear a thong sangle, but this one was really wide, I tried to give it to my daughter and it was even too wide for her. I should have sent it back, but I tried to wear it and now it is too late. It is very pretty if you have a wide foot."
4,Comfortable,"The footbed of this shoe is really comfortable, and they only took one day to break in. On a hot day my food will sweat under the large central strap and maybe cause rubbing. I'm happy with the purchase though."
3,A quiet Death,I like Alanna Knight. She is an easy and entertaining read. If you like Victorian mysteries she is quite good.
5,Tim Minchin is hilarious.,"I bought this Blue Ray for my father who loves Tim Minchin, seriously I once saw him sit at his computer for 5 hours watching Tim Minchin on Youtube. This is a UK only release so I was worried it might not play on his BluRay player, but oddly enough it worked fine without any issues at all."
4,Hamilton Beach blender,I really like this blender. I was using one of those personal blenders to make smoothies and it just didn't have the power that this one has. I had another blender but the bottom of the pitcher part would come off and everything would pour out. I'm very pleased with this one.
5,I waited too long,"Believe it or not, my old blender was 35 years old. It still worked well, so I hesitated to replace it. What a fool I was. This does the work in less than half the time. It is super-powerful and creates great circulation within the jar with minimal liquid. It cut my Thanksgiving soup-making by 20 minutes between the size of the jar and it's fast work. A full jar of vegetables pureed in about 4 seconds. A miracle for the price."
5,Daily Blender User,"I have purchased at least 6 blenders in the last 3 years. The Hamilton Beach model has been the best so far and the least expensive! We love the 14 speeds as we make smoothies several times a day and it seems to handle the frozen fruit and ice very well. The glass jar and measurements on the side are very handy. It washes up well in the dishwasher and seems more durable than the Cuisinart that we just bought and paid more money for. The only downside is that the jar could be bigger to hold more, but with all the other positives, this is not a big deal for us."
2,nice looking LASTED BARELY 2 MONTHS,"I was very impressed with this blender at first ,nice looking very quiet blender ..but after barely two months of normal use it burned while making a fruit smoothie"
3,Nice but does smell like the motor is going to burn out,I have only used this product once since I purchased it and it smells like the motor is burning up and about to explode...Otherwise it blends a wicked smoothie
3,"good warranty, ok motor, so far no problems","I bought this blender primarily due to the 3 year warranty after my black and decker died. Use it primarily to puree chicken. The technology the blender uses seems to work but you have to watch it because it will ""walk"" around the counter. If you are looking for a basic blender for you once in a while blending then buy it. if it is for really heavy duty use then I will think more on it and only buy since the warranty will back you since it is three years. Good luck"
3,Good blender but has limitations,"This is a powerful blender and makes great smoothies.The only problem is that this 'wave action' technology does not seem to work on all types of blending. My previous blender was also Hamilton Beach but without the 'wave action'. I used it to blend tomatoes by placing tomatoes cut in halves and adding very little water and it used to blend very nicely, creating a thick puree. This blender does not work that way. The tomatoes remain at the bottom and the water keeps churning. If I add plenty of water, enough to submerge the tomatoes, then it's able to blend but that makes the puree very watery and not what I want."
1,"This is a great blender, if you don't want to blend things.","Are you looking to make some lumpy smoothies? Want to have big chunks of unblended ice in them? Would you like to have unblended clumps stuck to the bottom of your blender's pitcher? Then this is the blender for you!Seriously, this blender is completely worthless as anything other than countertop ornamentation. This blender leaves lumps of unblended fruit after 2 solid minutes of blending, lumps of unblended ice cream in smoothies, and even when left on the highest setting for 2 minutes there are still pieces of ice half a centimeter in diameter. The only thing that ""Wave Action"" does is make sure that you have to wash the lid of the blender every single time you use it, even if you're only blending about half a pitcher's worth of liquid/solids.But hey, it looks okay sitting on your counter taking up space so at least it has that going for it.If I could give it negative stars I would."
3,Average Stuff,This is very good for single serving of milk shakes and smoothies but not good if you have filled the full jug. Its not that powerful and require little extra time to grind. But it never left solid pieces of fruits if you give it enough time to crush.
1,"A Great Workout, but doesn't work for long","Just using the trombone sprayer on our tiny 50x150' city yard wore me out, creating serious burn in the forearm muscles. The O-Rings will wear out and are virtually impossible to replace. Even after ordering the O-Ring replacement kit, the sprayer still leaks at all the connections, drenching the operator and not the yard."
3,trombone sprayer,"I had a previous Hudson trombone sprayer for years. It's parts had dried up so that it no longer functioned. The only complaint I had was that the parts needed were no longer available, so I had to purchase a whole sprayer where a few o-rings would have sufficed. The new sprayer works fine a gives me a long spray needed for a large mango tree. Hopefully a little periodic maintenance will give it a longer life."
2,......,"cooler perform okay if you do not stress out cpu (3.8 Ghz), if you do cpu temp. ran as high as 63 C within minutes..."
4,Pretty Cool,"This CD holds a special place in my collection because it's the first CD recorded by a Southern Gospel group with a live orchestra AND a live band and audience and everything.If you ignore the not-so-funny jokes, this CD is pretty cool.Features 'With All The Many Miracles', 'Just Wait 'Till He Stands Up', and 'A Pile Of Crowns' plus a whole host of other Rodney Griffin favorites.I'm not crazy about live recordings, but this is one that I actually listen to quite a bit.With a personal forward form Pastor Charles Stanley, how can you go wrong?"
5,I loved it!,"To me, every song on this live CD is a hit. They are recording with a live orchestra, and it sounds great.Features a forward from Pastor Charles Stanley.Rodney Griffin wrote most of the songs on here, and they really are a blessing.Greater Vision has come through again, and I can't really pick a favorite to expound on because I liked them all!"
5,"Good price, fast shipping, and works great","The battery arrived quickly, it was well-packed, and it works well in the phone. I no longer need to charge the battery so frequently. I would definitely deal with this company again."
5,Reasons why to have lgb trains,I think this toy is a great toy for kids because it is great for outdoor rail road too. I myself have these trains and alot of them too.They are also great for display too.
3,nice video but it does not teach reading!,"The sub-title of this video is misleading. I thought my child might learn to read, but that is not the emphasis of this video. It consists of a series of stories being read from a book by a cartoon character cat, with some illustrations of the stories.The viewer is not instructed in language, reading or phonetics. At the very end of the video, for a few minutes, several words appear on the screen below their images.The stories in themselves are nice, and my child, who is 20 months old, enjoys watching the video once in a while."
1,Ridiculous,"Well, I am torn between giving this book 1 or 5 stars. If taken seriously, 1 is too generous a number. However, my friends and I enjoy her ridiculous takes on such timeless issues as race relations, father fixations, masturbatory techniques, zen and the art of diaphragm insertion, and a guide to horniness (symptoms include nauseau, blurred vision, and SARS like sickness), to name a few.Has Ms. Heimel ever met a man? One cannot be sure, but my money is on 'no'. This book makes me nauseous, and not in the good sense."
3,Humorous read but impractical,"Heimel writes in an irreverant, quirky style which makes for an entertaining read. Some of the advice, however, seems impractical and outdated (condoms are condemned and the diaphragm is upheld as the best birth control). The Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll Diet which extols the virtues of cocaine and quaaludes seems straight out of the early 80's drug-chic culture. Helen Fielding seems to emulate Heimel's characteristic burned out, sexually jaded woman in Bridget Jones Diary. It's not nearly as naughty as the cover suggests but, in the end, is a lighthearted romp through sex and dating."
4,This is a great book covering the seam method.,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking better fit in dressmaking. The seam method of pattern alteration is pretty easy and straightforward. Judith presents alterations for the bodice, skirt, and pants. With the information in this book, you can alter your pattern for square or sloping shoulders, wide or narrow hips/waist, thin arms, rounded back, and many other necessary alterations. I did not find the bust alteration to be very helpful to me, however. I prefer other methods, but I often use the seam method for widening my waist and hips in my own patterns. Additionally, Judith offers style suggestions to flatter various figures. It is an interesting and useful book!"
2,An average book,"I bought this book for my sewing class; however, I don't like it because it doesn't have as much substance as the ""Fitting & Pattern Alterations"" book. In addition, it is over-priced. I like chapters 2 and 3 best out of the whole book. There is a typo on page 3, bullet #4. Most of the clothing sketches are dated; I've hardly seen anyone who dresses in those styles that were illustrated in the book. I personally don't believe that anyone can wear any style because each person has a different figure shape, height and weight. As for the style tip, I'd rather pick up a good how to dress fashion book."
4,GOT TO HAVE IT,"PRO AUDIO HAS GROWN ON ME, I FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE BEYOND MY GRASP, KIND OF LIKE RUBY....I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED WATCHING THE SPORT FROM THE SAFTY OF A PUB, BUT NEVER UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON, OR WHO TO ROOT FOR. PRO AUDIO TOOK ME OUT AND SHOWED ME THE WAY IT WANTED TO BE HEARD. IT UNFOLDED AND EXPLAIND ITS SELF. AS IF A TEAM OF FOOTBALLERS HAD HIJACKED ME TO A REMOTE SPRING TRAING BOOT CAMP. THEY SHAVED MY HEAD, AND ISSUED A ORANGE AND WHITE UNIFORM. PLAY TRACKS 5,6 AND 7 REAL LOUD, PERHAPS IN A FAST CAR EQUIPTED WITH A SUB WOOFER."
2,Very dissappointed,I already had a small and medium size diaper bag and I needed a large one for longer trips and I got this one. It turns out it wasn't a good investment. Although the bag looks really big you can' t really fill it up. The snaps will pop open. It's a big bag but has small capacity.
3,Mom of a new baby girl and 2 boys,I love the style and set up of this bag...all the little mesh compartments are great. With that said I only gave it 3 stars because the darn thing will not stay on my shoulders... It is really maddening to try to carry a 1 month old and this bag! I found a new bag similar to this one... This bag is going back to the store today.
5,Perfect size bag...,"I really don't see what all the fuss is about on this bag. I think it's absolutely great. Not too small and not too big. One person complained that the snaps didn't stay shut - well I don't seem to be having that problem since I don't overstuff it with way too much stuff. This is definitely not the bag to buy if you're going away for the weekend and need 10 pairs of extra clothes and diapers, but it is perfect for those long afternoon's shopping or for all the things a newborn needs. I love the style and it stays on my shoulder fine (no better or worse than our everyday purses). When you're carrying a baby carrier, a purse, a diaper bag, and holding a toddler's hand, the sheer awkwardness of all that tends to make the bag slip off, but when it's just the bag and I (and daddy's got the rest), it stays on just fine. It IS nylon here folks, take what comes with the territory or don't buy it..."
5,Great bag and I have two children!!!!,"I just got this bag as a gift from my mom we searched personally at BabiesRus to find the perfect bag. I am very picky and ""tried on"" practically every bag we could find...this was the one for me. I am due in 4weeks with my second child and already have a 15month old who keeps me going. With two in diapers this bag is a God-send. I have already packed it for the new little one and have plenty of room for my son's things too! I love this bag!"
3,Replacing this with something better,I bought this diaper bag because I needed something large for when we travel. I agree with other reviews. It does not stay on my shoulder and the snaps pop open easily making things fall out and an overall messy diaper bag. I do like the large pockets and mesh pockets as well as various compartments. It is almost too large though and doesn't fit well under the stroller either. I am going to replace it with one that zips closed and is a bit smaller. I also want one with a non-sliding shoulder strap.
3,"Not that great, too big","I am a good mom who nurses her children so I don't *need* stuff other than my breasts and my baby (and maybe a diaper or two, lol) so this bag was too big. Babies don't need *stuff*, just mom! Plus it didn't stay on my shoulders well, despite the fact that I had little in it (change of clothes, diaper and wipes). I could however carry it easily when I used my slings, which was most of the time, so baby safe and secure in the sling which allowed me to have 2 free hands to carry the bag. Overall it was just 'ok' and sits in the attic."
4,This Book Is Superb!,"As someone who as actually purchased this book and read it, I have to COMPLETELY disagree with the above review. There is nothing wrong with this book's ending, as no one who has even a passing knowledge of Dante's Inferno will attest.The ending is a set-up to the coming sequel, just like Dante did, where the journey progresses from Hell to Heaven.I can't wait!"
5,wonderful,I actually love this pattern. By far my favorite out of all the ones I have bought. Just so cute!
5,Very Pleased,I recieved this order in a very timely maner and in great shape.Thank you very muchLinda
2,Egh,Ive seen a bunch of this season on TV and I dont have this dvd yet but season 7 was pretty darn dull. I found that the avatars and Zankou were on the show way too long. If you found that Cole was a good character but wasted a lot of show space with all of his problems then the avatars and Zankou will have the same effect. Great show iffy season.
2,Charmed VII,"I must admit,season 7 was perhaps the worst of the post Shannon Dougherty years.After hitting a creative peak in seasons four and five.(Season six despite the negative reviews was a solid season.)The series seemingly hit a wall in season seven.I honestly believe (sorry Charmed Fans) that 7 & 8 should have been combined to form one great final season instead of a bad season and a mediocre one.UPDATE:Season 8 is slated to come out during September 2007,but the music (including the theme song) will be changed.I recently found out that budget cuts caused Daryl and Leo's disappearance (well Leo's semi-disappearance!) but can someone explain Billie & Christy to me? Their addition to the storyline...uh,yuck! The last episode made up for those two,thank goodness."
5,One of the best seasons ever,"This season is one of the best. Leo finally gets to spend some time with his family even though it is not for free. We finally et to see Wyatt in action, and just when Piper thinks that she can really have a normal life, well...Moving on to demons, Zankou is one of the best demons the series ever had, he can even be compared to Barbas.Other than that, the twist that the series will take from this season on, it's going to be interesting i know first hand. Great season(and great price)"
5,Charmed - The Complete Seventh Season,"I have all of the ""Seasons"" so far. This is, I think, one of the best because it shows the girls being ""one"" together but having separate lives. I love the show and cannot wait for season eight!!!!"
4,A little downhill,"The show is still good, but much cheesier than before. It was alot darker when Belthazar/Cole Turner (Julian McMahan) was on the show. It has become less serious, but it does kinda come back near the end of the season as Leo meets the ""Great Power"" that has had everyone a little on edge."
2,Charmed -- Season Seven,"Being a hugh fan of Charmed I would purchase this set of DVD's, as well as seasons 1-6. The quality of the video is by far substandard of anything else I've ever purchased. Also, the small circular tabs that hold the center of the DVD have arrived broken in pretty much every season, on every disk. This varies from 3-4 tabs to almost all of them."
5,Great Season,I think that this season is very good just like all the other seasons. I thought that they ended this season very well considering they were not sure at the time if there was going to be a season 8 or not. I think that any charmed fan should own this season.
5,Charmed 7,"I was so happy this wasnt the last season. I think it would have been a bad idea to end it the way they did. But nonetheless I love this season, because well I love love love charmed"
5,Love charmed,Great DVDsI love charmed This was a great set of disc charmed season finally will make me cry Paige phoebe piper pure Leo Chris Wyatt forever
5,Great Season!,"I think this is a great season! but, then again I love every Season of Charmed! I think this season is very much worth buying! and hey have you guys noticed that we got the pretty cover this time! I saw a different copy somewhere else I think it was ebay it was a ugly yellow! the cover we have is much prettier! well guys we only have one more season to get and our collection will be complete!"
1,It has no Charm,"Well let's see, you have a show where the cast was clearly hired for their looks and they have no talent at all, and as for writing, forget it. I don;t think anyone on this show even knows how to write."
1,Nausea,"I bought Charmed, Seventh Season, for my wife, who loves this show. I personally become physically ill just hearing the theme song.Enjoy!"
1,Didn't work,"When this product arrived it wasn't functioning. I added new batteries and it wouldn't even turn on. Therefore, my perspective on this product is very poor."
1,Junk,None of them worked. Threw them in the trash. Guess there is no quality control or testing before being shipped to customer. Won't order from this vendor again
4,Good general finanacial and investing book,"This is a good general book describing financail terms, invetsting, and monetary tools. Historical background is provided. Very readable. I got this to use as a primer for my teenager. It worked well for that. Very up to date with descriptions of even recent investment instruments.Does not pretend to give investement advice or guidance."
4,Perfect for novice investors or as an educational tool on the mechanics of finance!,"I bought this book as a refresher for my wife. As an avid investor of stocks, bonds, munis, etc, I thought I would bring my wife up to speed with the fundamentals of investment strategy.I read the entire book on a business trip and discovered that I wasn't as wise as I had once thought! This was the perfect refresher for US monetary basics. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in balancing their investment funds."
5,An Introduction to Wall Street,"As often happens, the marketing title does not accurately reflect the author's purpose in writing the book. As a brief introduction to Wall Street terminology, history, and trivia, this book is an absolute gem. It is not, however, a ""complete guidebook"" to ""money & investing."" The book does offer excellent layman overviews on ""money & investing"" topics including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, futures, real-estate, and retirement investing. The coverage is as ""complete"" as can be expected from a 200-page book. The author's emphasis is in clarifying concepts at the operational level rather than getting lost in the mathematical details. True to the spirit of a ""guidebook,"" there are sections on ""online resources"" and ""suggesting reading"" at the end of each chapter. However, even the ""suggested reading"" does not go deep enough. So, when you're ready to dig deeper, you would be well advised to pick up a college text on corporate finance."
2,Basic Stuff,I was not impressed with this book. It is just basic stuff. I would have expected a more sophisticated analyis of financials from this publisher.
3,wlaa street journal,A fair amount of information for those who know little of the workings of stock and bonds. Worth the price and a handy refferece guide.
1,Huge disappointment,"I love, love, LOVE Forever New soap powder and its liquid version, Ovacion, for cleaning not just lingerie, but towels and sheets as well, I have used the FN soap products to spot-clean dirt and grime, so I thought the Stain Remedy would work even better. Not so much! I followed instructions, but it did not work on bloodstains or other not-oil-based stains. Don't bother buying this, but DO buy Forever New soap products. They're the best!"
4,Highly recommend,"A ""How To"" drink, serve, buy and enjoy wine DVD! An informative untintimidating journey. Ian White shares his expanded knowledge in a fun, upbeat presentation. He expands on wines from Chardonnay to Merlot to Zinfandel, a good broad perpespective on wine varietals. The DVD offers lots of good, common-sense advice on simple tasting,how to buy wine and how to taste and enjoy wine.A good buy."
5,THANK YOU for my gift Susan!,"I received this as a Christmas gift along with a wine basket, what fun! FUN MUSIC, nice locations.I had some friends over and after dinner we popped in the DVD and had our own little wine tasting. Each person brought a different bottle and we all participated in our own learning experience.Since I am a novice in the wine world, Ian's presentation was very enlightening. I do feel as if I can find my way through a dinner paring now, and do it with ease. Actually having the wine there and tasting it as Ian presented it was a great hands on learning experience.If you are trying to understand this fast growing world of wine, TUNE INTO this DVD! You'll be glad you did.Be creative and make a fun night of this with friends."
2,Product disappointment!!!!,"This product was a disappointment to me. The Seiko didn't do very much. I ended up having to use the trimmer to do the entire job! Granted, you need to be careful with the trimmer. Seiko Pubic Trimmer was a complete disappointment -- it was a joke!"
3,Its OK,There are not a lot of puzzles with a lot of color and it is not easy to chose puzzles. You are able to chose the number of pieces but not change the shapes like on jigzone.
1,too complicated,I could not get this to load right on my computer. I got the pictures but I didn't get an icon so I could work the puzzles. Probably not for the average computer user.
4,Brews beer with muscle,This is a great burner for quick heating of 10gallons of water. It heats 10 gallons from around 50F to boiling in around 20 minutes. It does not come with a pot. It eats gas.
1,Poor Quality Control,"I bought this item because of a great price, Amazon shipped it regualr UPS and I received it earlier that expected, the box looked in good shape but when I opened it one of the legs was broken off,I thought at first that it must have taken a pretty good hit to do that, so I called customer service and they sent me a return tag and shipped me a new one right out, I got it, opened it and the exact same thing, box was in good shape but 1 leg was broken, I called customer service and again they shipped another one out, this time second day air. I get the third one and guess what, the exact same thing for the third time! I looked at it carefully and each time it was broken at the weld in two areas on the cooker and it had to have been poor workmanship and quality control, it even looked like it had rusted in one weld! I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service,but I wouldn't reccommend buying the banjo cooker by mail order!"
4,Bayou Classic Cooker,This is a heavy duty cooker that is very good at cooking large pots. The only negative thing I have to say is the box was ripped in places and some of the hardware fell out through the holes.
1,Very Inefficient,"I bought this for brewing beer - I use 80 and 104 quart (Huge!) pots.I also have a banjo burner I bought from Agri-Supply -[...] for the same price after paying for shipping.Last club brew day I had 2 80 quart pots filled with water - one on each of the burners, the Agri-Supply pot came up to temp at least 3x faster than the Bayou Classic burner!Another note - probably > 70% of the heat produced by this burner does not apply to the kettle and instead heats the surrounding area - making it unbearable to work around it here in the Florida summer heat.One other note on the quality - the Bayou Classic label was put on upside down!Wish I could return it!"
1,It Sucks,I should have sent them back to Amazon but I was pressed for time. I ordered 4 of them and they all were broke in the box. I would not even give Bayou one star. Doooooonooooot doonooot do not waste your money or time on this one. Made in China what can you expect. Shame on you Amazon I went with your company because of your reputation.
3,The regulator broke after 2 uses. Old style with secondary valve best for use.,Little bit getting use to from other style. Purchased to cook turkeys in large pot 3 at once. Success if you get max flame.
4,I like it,"I purchased this burner for home brewing. My wife got tired of me using the stove top and smelling up our house with the delicious smell of boiling wort. This is a very powerful burner, it reduced my boil time. Only caution is that if you have the flame up too high, it will blow out. Other than that, I like it."
2,Not new!,"When I bought this product, it was said to be ""new""! However, upon opening the package it arrived in, the cooker was in an already opened inner box. I though that perhaps someone just opened the inner box to check the item before it was sent? As I opened the inner box, one of the ""legs"" on the cooker was broken off and rusted! I needed to use this right away so I did not send it back. Now I will have to get this ""leg"" welded back on! Beware of the ""new"" designation!"
3,Sounds Like a Jet Engine,"This burner worked awesome for boiling our huge 120 quart pot full of water and crawfish fairly quickly. It took about 20 minutes, but we're talking 30 gallons of water. I didn't have the problems others did. The burner I received was in new condition, and well built (all legs and welds were in good shape). The heat this thing puts out is remarkable, and it makes a raging sound.The only drawback (and reason for the three star rating) is, it burns through a LOT of propane fast. If you're using a typical gas grill style propane tank, you need to have a backup tank nearby. It pulls propane out of the tank so quickly, it occasionally freezes up the line, and we have to swap to the backup tank while the other thaws out."
2,Not happy at all,"I purchased 3 Bayou Classic KAB4 Banjo Cookers. As I was preparing to use these in the steaming of crabs for a crab feast, I couldn't get the gas flame high enough to get a full head of steam with any of the three cookers that I bought. I have dealt with the older cookers in the past and have had great success, but these were just not up to par with the older models. After some research I found that the problem was with the regulators. Although I was expecting to get 30 PSI regulators I got 20 instead, and it does not cut it when you are steaming in 100 plus quart pots. I am going to contact the manufacturer to see if they will send me another type of regulator but if they do not, these are going back."
3,Overall All Good,"Purchased for brewing. One of the cast burner nipples was broken off on arrival, (not in the box so it must have been at the factory) I didn't send it in since it seems to work just fine. Creates an incredible amount of heat. I will need to weld some more material to the top as the 4 small round bars will not safely support my keggle."
4,Works Great for Brewing,I bought this to brew with and it works excellent. Once I bring my 10 gallon kettle to a boil I reduce the power and it still maintains a boil. It was easy to put together and took about an hour to get the air/gas mixture adjusted. The only thing I would like to see is a better wind shield.
5,Hot Buy,This burner works well for frying turkeys. When you drop the turkey into the fryer the oil temp doesn't drop because the flame temp is hotter. Great investment and well worth the price.
3,Tricky to set up,"The HABA Ball Track set is fabulous and I recommend it highly but of all the add-on's purchased, this was the hardest to set up and adjust. Purchased for a five year old boy, it was way beyond his abilities and was quite a challenge even for an adult. Once set up correctly, one little bump would undo a lot of work and took the fun out of it. However, a challenge can be a good thing and it does teach patience."
4,Fun and educational!,"I bought this set for my 3 and half years old son. He loves to watch the ball rolling down and spining in the plate. That always keeps him concentrated. Also, this is a toy for kid and parents. Because little kid needs help to set it up and find out the way to block the marble from the plate. The quality of the wood is great. The only problem is too easy to lose the small ball. It is expensive, but worth for the money."
1,"Size too big, fabric is bad","I ordered 4 of them because they were on sale. But all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be. In addition, the fabric is bad. There are tores in all of the edges."
1,worst pants i bought online,i would not recommend this pant at all . looks like they are used pants . size 34 pants are like size 36 . not worth a single dollar .
2,Very Bad!,"I did not like these pants as they looked like they had been worn already! The hems were already frayed where they meet the shoe..was very displeased but decided not to send them back. Maybe I should have, but needed them! On sale or not, I think someone needs to check them out before sending."
3,Better then the last two,"I love Darren Hayes, and I enjoy this album much more then his last two solo ventures. The problem for Darren I think is that everyone compaires him to his Savage Garden days. And he kind of needs to respect that, seeing that all of us that were in jr high, high school during that time, are now reviewing his art.I have to say that Darren has one of the BEST male voices I have ever heard! His range is amazing and that is one of the reasons I rated this album so high. Unfortunately, I DO miss the edgeyness that SG songs like, I WANT YOU, TEARS OF PEARLS, and CHAINED TO YOU gave him.Yes, there are good songs on this album, (""Setting Sun"", The Tunning of Violins"", ""Walk Away"") but many times I felt like I wanted the current song to finish so I could see what the next one was like. There were also times when the melody was perfect but I felt the lyrics were not right and vice versa.A disc like this make me appreciate the importance of song order on an album."
3,Different but good,This album is very different from his previous albums but good in it's own way. You have to be in the mood for this music though as it is more upbeat. I think I will listen to it less than his earlier music.
4,Not Disappointed,"At first listen, I was not thrilled with the songs; however, they all tend to grow on you. Each time I hear the songs, I like them a bit more. As a true DH fan, I, of course, am not disappointed with the purchase."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"Most songs have the same beat from start to finish, so even though they have clearly defined choruses they still come off more like dance tracks than pop songs. The fact that it's a double album makes the generic songs more forgiveable but it soon becomes apparent that there isn't much focussed composition to back up the superficial appeal of the unique retro/modern techno-pop sound, and the consistently claustrophobically full-bodied production and unchanging singing style makes the distinction between ballads and upbeat tracks almost redundant."
1,Disappointment,"I was so excited to hear Darren Hayes was releasing a new album, that I bought it without hearing anything from it. Big waste. Some songs are alright. Most of them are so bad I can't even listen.Definitly listen before you buy."
4,Interesting,"This dual cd album was an interesting new step for Darren Hayes, and it seems to be a concept album as well. While quite different from his past works, it holds a lot of ""hit-worthy"" songs (mostly at the start of each cd), and is worth getting if you are a Darren Hayes fan."
1,Mindless Hunters,A junky low budget thriller. The saddest part about this movie is the lure of Kilmer and Slater who could have been replaced by some more worthless actors. Instead many people looking for a half decent movie saw them on the cover and got a bad helping of rotten movie.
3,Entertaining -- that's all!,"If you adored ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""No Way Out,"" don't bother. As another reviewer stated, it could have been great. To me, ""Mind Hunters"" was not mind-bending! Yes, there were twists and turns, but to no real effect."
5,COOL BEANS,"This movie si really interesting, and what is a trip, all of there weakness is what kills them, the killer use some form of what they like or love the most, become the one thing that will kill them without them even knowing it....!"
2,Inexcusable ending,"Mindhunters is a decent enough movie, it's purely a popcorn flick. I wouldn't watch this expecting an intelligent thriller. The ""twist"" at the end is so illogical I couldn't help but laugh for the last 10 minutes of the movie. Nevertheless, it's entertaining enough, just not smart."
2,I couldn't suspend my disbelief long enough...,"How Did Val Kilmer and Christian Slater get sucked into this messy film? Man, Slater needs a better agent - this is the second crappy film that he has walked through (and why the star billing? C. Slater fans - don't bother, he is in this film for less than 35 minutes).This film, about a serial killer hunting FBI agents who hunt serial killers, is pretty weak. I could not get my mind around the main premise of the film: that one of the FBI agents is ""the killer"", a person this psychotic would'nt be able to sit still long enough to take the Feds' screening tests, let alone pass them.And then there's all the kooky methods that he uses to kill people are just plain ridiculous. Then there's the dialog: characters say nonsense just to be confusing.Don't pay too much for this movie.."
2,My head hurts !,"This was not a good movie at all.It seems like this type of flick has been done before ,but I just can't nail the name of that movie.I knew who the killer was almost from the get go.Toward the ending the writers make you think it's LL that's doing the killing but the whole time it was that british actor ""?""that played Van Helsing's partner in Wes Cravens' Dracula 2000.I can safely say that the Longest Yard was the better of the two that were released on Tuesday.Please don't even bother buying or renting this movie , it was terrible.It was a waste of my hour an a half."
2,Mindhunters WASTE OF YOUR MIND!!,"This film was continuously pushed back again and again and when I finally saw it IN THE THEATER!! (YES IT WAS RELASED IN THE THEATERS!!) I was so dissapointed!!! first off you NEVER got to know the chactors, some died way to quickly, and the way they died was so unrealstic and just stupid for example the death by the liquid nitrogen, how in the world could that happen?!? and the scene where they are climbing on the walls because the room is filling with water and they're affraid of being electrocuted my god that was retarded. The storyline had a lot of potential if it was left in the right hands and now I know why the studio was very very hesitant to release it, this piece of crap was made in 2002 but released in theaters in late 2004 or maybe it was very early 2005. Avoid this film at all costs, unless you like to sit there and actully have your mind turn into mush. Mindhunters is Mindnumbing useless violence, horriable acting and directing."
3,seen it,when i was deployed to the desert in the early part of 2004 i saw the movie. it was a copied version. they released this movie in some of europe and the middle east in the fall of 2003. kinda weird that its an american movie but we are the last to see it :-) hahaa
4,My Kind Of Movie,"I enjoyed the suspense in this movie. I may have to watch it again, now that I know the outcome. Just to see if the perpertrator was even capable when I look at the timelines."
2,mind hunters,The actors worth seeing are quickly cut out of the film. Perhaps they knew what was coming! Just a uninteresting story in a uninteresting setting with acting that couldn't pull it off.
2,ouch,I couldn't finish it. It was just to far fetched and... ridiculous. The acting cringe-making.I really had high hopes - it sounded like a good idea. And I'm sort of a fan of Val Kilmer.I suppose this review should take into account that I didn't finish the movie. Maybe there was an amazing ending.
1,And then there was dumb.,"""He's using our weaknesses against us!"" exclaims one of twenty-something-mod-squad-fab-FBI-future-profilers. Yes! Their painful lack of intelligence. Five seconds after the first ingenious murder (Has anyone ever heard of stepping out of the way?) the best and brightest of the FBI turn into the panicked camping college students of Friday the 13th, Part 1-20. How else can they fall, one by one, to the most improbably outlandish murders since Dr. Phibes (nobody's done it better) fell asleep again? The profiler format has been done much better in any number of films as has the nine little indians. Val Kilmer was the only bright flicker in the whole film and he was gone in 60 seconds. The rest was like a bad ""Alien"" rip-off without the gooey alien. Save your money and watch ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent."""
2,Cheesey,"A plot that has been done before, but better.Weak acting.Suspense punctuated with over-the-top violence."
4,hunters,"Wow this film was suspensful. You don't know who the killer is though after watching the film, you get the hints and can see the killer right from the start. The traps in the film were cool and you didn't know who was going to die or how. Everyone keeps turning on each other and the twist was good. An all-star cast and fun plot. A great film indeed and you never know when profiling in real life can come in handy."
4,This movie is SO underrated!,"When you see the cover and read the title and the names of the actors (a rapper and two has-beens), you think that it's just another bad straight-to-video suspense/horror/action movie and that's what I expected, but it's VERY good! It's very entertaining, the plot is very good, (some of) the characters are great and it's pretty damn violent (some of the CGI is pretty weak though)!Recommended to anyone who loves entertaining thrillers!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Mindhunters is enjoyable enough and quick-moving but exceptionally contrived; the fun of this type of movie should be to guess the killer, but when the answer is arbitrary anyway (something like 3 endings were shot) the movie loses its reason for being."
2,Thriller or a cop story,"Very disapointing film with two major stars in it: Val Kilmer and Christian Slater. But not even these two actors can save hopeless plot of the movie. This is supposed to be a story of FBI profilers (about a dozen of them) preparing for the drill on deserted island. Before long, they notice that their excercise is turning into real fight for survival. One of them is a killer, only no one knows who it is. As each profilers is offed every 5 minutes in the very innovative way (no two murders are the same and some are quite psychopatic), we are kept at the edge of our seat trying to figure out which one is the real killer. Moral of the story - even the FBI can let a sociopath slip into their ranks...Unless you are in the mood to waste your time, do not watch this movie."
3,Average,"Seen it before. I thought it was a new movie. The plot was interesting, but weird. I lost touch with it again."
3,Potentially good,This could have been a great movie and almost was. They went more for blood and guts over a good movie. One thing I like about 1950s horror flicks is they could scare the crap out of you and never stoop to blood and guts and graffic close ups of lady smoking an acid cigarette and melting. It just got way too gross. So I almost liked the movie it was almost good it just wasn't good.
4,grand movie,good movie came fast and on time. the movies came before the time specified which is always great had no problems at all
3,Meh,How to review this. Definitely suspenseful. Pretty gory. They try to keep you guessing right until the end and do a decent job of it.
3,Another Rainy Day,Great little way to spend an afternoon. I definitely will watch this again some rainy Saturday in January. Recommend this movie.
3,Predictable,The movie was predictable and used the tired plotline to kill off the box office draw in the beginning. You are left with average acting and a predictable ending.
3,Good Movie,"Didn't realize it, but I had already seen this movie. It was good the second time I watched It.You Should watch it."
2,Nevermind Hunters,Mind Hunters was not a memorable movie. It skipped my mind that I even watched it. Watched the trailer to remind me what the movie was about. I now remember it to be mind numbing. If you are bored and have absolutely nothing else to do or can't get to sleep you probably wouldn't mind watching it.
3,A little over the top,"I had no idea what this movie was about for about the first 20 minutes, because it focused on creating a back-story before the overall plot took place.Then when the movie got going, I was confused on what was going on.I think the movie could have been better without the first 45 minutes, because that just throws you off completely.And the rest was a blur, because I had zoned out completely before the climax."
3,"Average; ""USA Network"" fare","I saw a commercial for this movie on TV... the commercial made it look really great! It was ok; but certainly not great... the sort of movie you would expect to watch on the ""USA Network"" on a saturday afternoon. It was kind of predictible, and all the big stars in the movie had relatively small parts."
4,A good Phycological Thriller,"I rented this movie mostly because I like Kathryn Morris from Cold Case. I'm also a big fan of physiological thrillers; I much prefer them to blood and guts scary movies. I thought this movie was a very well done ""killer among us"" themed movie. Everyone was a suspect and at one point or another you suspect each character of the murders. Some parts were implausible but I have a good suspension of disbelief so I didn't mind.Basic plot: Student FBI Profilers are sent to an island for their last test. One by one each of them are killed and they each suspect the others of being the killer. As each person dies their paranoia grows and they begin to turn on each other.All in all, I'm glad I rented the movie."
2,Misleading,"I thought this was a movie starring Val Kilmer and Christian Slater but their parts were incredibly small. It was a good thing that Cold Case's Kathryn Morris and L.L. Cool J were there to take up the slack. The whole time I kept expecting there to be a ""April Fool's"" movie moment. The weird photography designed to make you jump became annoying after the first ten times."
4,GOOD TRILLER RIDE!!!!,"I just bought this DVD, I liked the movie, But some where else under $18.00..I liked the story a lots twist and turns and get u guessing whose the killer till end the movie, A lots suspense and mystery from begging till end. Was clever little thriller..The cast is real good having some few cute guys in it to LOOK :),If u cares. Might not really to buy. But definitely worth a rental!!. If u like ""suspense/mystery thriller""! B+"
1,Laughing at a Washed-Up Writer in a Mid-Life Crisis,"As The Lost Blogs is fictional, so is Davidson's washed up career as a comedian, author and blogger.Men in Midlife CrisisDavidson even creates fake fans on his site he chats with because he has no life.The Lonely GuyHe accuses retired celebritiesLittle Darlingsof stalking himThe Paranoid's Pocket Guideand lives in a dump neighborhood in Sherman Oaks.

5,dizzope.....,"okay, im gonna tell it like this. playboi is bringin heet with this album. for really, heads aint ready for this right here. playboi is sicker than most and does this bling club ish like a seasoned veteran. and i KNOW kids aint ready for the production team ebony and ivory, this duo is bringing it like no other son. the beats are straight player! so if you wanna know what the sucka free, san jo, daly city, oakland and the whole yay is all about, pick this up right nizzow. werdemup!"
5,Great rake. Got all the leaves!,"What a great rake. I got all the leaves in one pass. Light, flexible, strong. I'm very happy with this leaf rake purchase."
2,Won't be worth it after I buy the (separate) required transformer...,For some reason lighted address signs are both really hard to find and/or outrageously expensive for what they are. They also seem quite sparingly reviewed. The sign I really wanted ran on rechargeable batteries but was going to cost about $200 all told. I found that outrageous and went with this one as a budget alternative.Turns out you cannot just directly wire this into your house. You either have to wire it into your *doorbell* (stupid!) which has a lower current--or you have to buy a separate $15-$20 transformer/plug to go into an outlet.If I hadn't purchased this through a slow-as-molasses 3rd party amazon seller (rather than amazon proper) this would be going back. Now this $20 light is going to cost at least $35. I hate stuff like that.
5,"Not his best work, but still amazing...","I very much enjoyed Dark Sister on its own merits, but of course it is impossible not to compare it to his previous works. For all the intensity this book brings, it felt somewhat ""light"" to me compared to ""The Tooth Fairy"". However, Graham Joyce could write a shopping list and it would still be better than almost anything being written today. I am still amazed by his ability to draw you into a very real story with very real and sympathetic characters, and then introduce through dark, fantastical elements the magic that underlies all our lives, if we are open enough to see them. This blend is amazingly difficult to achieve, and again he does it with well crafted prose and wonderful insight. I look forward to a long and prolific career from Mr. Joyce."
4,A Good First Graham Joyce Outing,"A worthy effort by Mr. Joyce, particularly if this is your first introduction to his fiction. The book never lets up, from the first page on, in spite of what I feel was a clumsy and rushed final three chapters. If this sort of book is your cuppa, try Dennis Wheatley's ""The Devil Rides Out."" Dated, but consistent."
2,offensive and jarring book,"I had hoped for much after reading other reviews here, but came away from Dark Sister feeling offended. Yet another book where Pagans have a Dark Side (as if Christianity didn't?) and where an insipid woman doggedly seeks power to the near destruction of self and family, only to return to joyous suburbia. Quite like a magical and sexual version of a Harlequin romance. The writing style itself is quite good, if the plot and characterization of women leaves something to be desired."
4,Fast Paced and Entertaing Story,"I enjoyed this novel a great deal. It was well written, crisply paced, and had an interesting premise. It is the story of Maggie, a seemingly ordinary housewife who stumbles upon a witch's journal. She finds herself drawn into the world of witchcraft. What I found so well done about the novel was it's emphasis on the effect of Maggie's transformation on her family. In fact, the family relationships are the focus of the novel. This was an interesting twist and was quite well executed.The characters are well developed and sympathetic, even Alex, Maggie's overbearing husband. The plot develops smoothly and moves along at a brisk pace. As always Joyce writes realistic dialogue. I didn't find this story to be as scary as some other reviewers led me to believe, but that was not a problem.My only complaint is that the ending is a little too neat and happy."
4,GREAT BOOK,"Any book that makes you afraid to turn the lights out gets my vote, as this one did. Reminds me of Steward's, Tales of Dirt, Danger, and Darkness."" Buy this book!"
2,Inconsistent power readings vs. PowerTap,"For a device at this price, I wouldn't expect much: just a consistent power reading for the effort I put in. It doesn't even have to be correct or reflect short spikes in power. To test this out, I bought one and used it with my PowerTap. The initial readings were pretty close. But over the course of a one hour workout, it drifted by about 30 watts for me. As the fluid in the trainer heats up, it gets easier and easier to spin. While this is great for the ego, it's not useful for training, as the computer makes no adjustment for this. Even if the readings were wrong, if they were consistently wrong it would still be a useful device. As it is, it's pretty useless. I returned it."
1,Can't get it to work,I have been playing with this for a few months and have given up. The instructions are horrible and am not going to waste another weekend on it. I still need a computer for my trainer and am not sure what I am going to buy.
2,grumble grumble,"the directions are horrible. i've hooked something like this up before , and so i improvised. it doesnt work. i called customer service , they responded quickly and tried to resolve problem. they're sending me a new wire for it."
2,Frustrated...,"This is not the easiest computer odometer to operate. It functions well, but is somewhat difficult to reset. Will need to spend more time with the operation manual."
1,They have to be kidding,"I concur with the reviews that describe this device as shoddy and poorly manufactured. However, I want to add that it is totally a misrepresentation to describe this as a ""power computer."" It doesn't really compute power. What is does is take your speed and run it through a simple equation that derives your ""power"" as a function of your speed. If you are expecting a device that does anything but give you a rough approximation of your power output by placing your speed into a quadratic equation with some regression coefficients derived from who-knows-where..this isn't it. Very deceptive product description..good thing it's cheap."
4,Good stuff,If you dont have a computer in stalled on your bike now with a rear pickup then you will love this.
1,Great in theory.... if you can install it!!,"Didn't get far enough to see how this thing worked because installation was ridiculous with poor directions/instructions. I consider myself pretty mechanically inclined but these directions were impossible to follow. So rather than waste time and aggravate myself further, I'm returning this thing!"
2,watt the heck!,"Very cheaply made. Readout is small. Buttons are loose. Wires are flimsy. Shocking contrast in quality when compared to the Kinetic Road Machine trainer I bought it with. Should be included free with a $275 trainer in my opinion. But it works, just not worth 45-50 bucks. Be careful installing it as to not pull out the wires or crack the plastic tab that locks the computer on to the mount."
1,Very Poorly Designed,"Good idea, poorly designed. The display is not appropriate for serious workouts. The premise is that you can see your power output becuase the Kinetic trainers are so accurate. However, while you are observing your power, you cannot see your cadence. So, you can't accurately maintain your rpm and power at the same time, but both aspects are important when training. I returned the product because it didn't meet my needs."
5,Bruder Jeep Wrangler with Horse Trailer,"Purchased this for my granddaughter, was pleased with the quality of the toy. The granddaughter loves horses and the horse trailer is big enough to carry a couple of larger horses or several smaller horses she has in her collection. She was pleased and fascinated that the doors and hood of the Jeep opened, the top of the jeep was removable, and the steering wheel worked. Her brother received the green Jeep Wrangler and skid steer trailer with caterpilar. It was a way to give them the same thing yet in different colors so they would know whose was whose. Their Dad was pleased with the packaging! It was easy to remove the toys from the boxes. A good fun QUALITY toy the kids can use their imagination with and make their own engine noise. No ""bleeps"" and ""bloops""."
4,Christmas gift approved,"I bought this toy for my 3 yr old nephew for Christmas who LOVES horses and Jeeps. But my 14 year old had to try it out, when he saw it arrive; using the excuse ""you know your nephew is a brut; will this hold up."" Well it got the approval of my 14 year old. We'll see how it does Christmas morning."
4,Great Toy for a Boy or Girl,I purchased this for my nephew age 5 he loves Jeeps last year I got him the Bruder with the payloader. Both items have held up well and he has gotten hours of play. What is really cute is the horse and trailer he of course puts other animals / toy's in and drives them around. Great toy very happy with both of my purchases.
4,Broke too quickly,"My three-year-old son loves this toy. The spare wheel broke off the back of the Jeep the second or third time he played with it. I contacted customer service and they quickly let me know which part to purchase. It was only $5, but I was disappointed I had to purchase the part when it broke so quickly. Overall, it is a great toy."
3,Looks sturdier than it is; still fun,"This toy is a little more cheaper made than you expect. However, it is fun and the shocks on the jeep are really cool. My daughter enjoys playing with it. Worth buying, just be prepared for more plastic than you think."
5,Nothing Plain About Treva...,There's nothing plain about this recording.It's fabulous! Great acoustics andvocals that just melt.Treva is a genuine diamond with a voice that shines.
3,O.k.,"Being a somewhat fan of the Toilet Boys, I decided to purchase this live cd.I can't say it's the best but it ain't the worst either.The live sound quality isn't very ""professional"" but in the spirit of punk, it doesn't necessarily have to be.In my own opinion, their studio albums fare off better.This is really more for the hardcore Toilet Boys fans."
3,Weak to deal with the non-archealogica side of the scrolls,"Prof VanderKam does an excellent job in summarising the ""objective"" side of the scrolls. That is, the book is a good source of information on the archeological aspects of the documents; it is very well organised. However, the author is extremely superficial when dealing with the controversy sorrounding its meaning and interpretation.As the book was published in the UK by the ""Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge"", the author is quick to discredit any theories proposed by other schollars that may challenge the views of the lack of relationship between the established beliefs of the Christian church and the Dead Sea Scrolls.It is rather unfortunate that a well-known researcher on the topic of the Dead Sea Scrolls looses his objective thus not being prepared to advance any theories that may upset the establishment."
4,How to Survive and Thrive After You Are Promoted,"If you're about to become a manager for the first time and aren't really sure what you're getting into, author Michael Morris' book is required reading. It provides a wealth of information and insight into your new job. Likewise, if you are a first-time manager and you're floundering a bit, read this to see how to turn your new career around and become successful. We also recommend it to anyone who is considering an executive career. Here's a sneak peak into what you can expect as a member of management."
1,Beware,I'm a big Boz fan and was excited to see that there was a Volume Two (2) to his Fade Into Light . . . only to later discover that it is NOT a volume two but the original repackaged with a different cover!!!
1,NOT VOLUME 2!,"I have tried to alert Amazon Quality Control to change the name of this CD but for some reason they have not corrected this error.THIS IS THE BRILLIANT BOZ SCAGGS CDBoz Scaggs: Fade Into Lightas you can plainly see from the re-packaged cover.Follow that link -- the MP3 version is/was under $10 -- and listen to this great album, but don't let these sellers fool you with their huge price-tags, they are not selling Volume Two as there is no Volume Two. (And they know it.)"
4,"Westinghouse 52"" ceiling fan",It is a stable fan. It is quiet and moves a lot of air. It was simple to install. The look is simple and the four bulbs provide more than enough light. The only concern was that the bulbs have a small end on them (candellabra???).
3,Nice fan but . .,"Very nice ceiling fan but two of the light globes were broken upon arrival. Quick trip to Home Depot to buy four new globes as I was unable to find a Westinghouse match to the originals, which were much nicer than the ones I had to buy. Oh well, fan works great, easy install but I would also have preferred being able to use regular CFLs instead of the candelabra things."
4,Good for digital cameras too.,I just bought this case for my canon powershot s45 digital camera. it fits great and has an extra front pocket for accessories. comes with a tripod 35mm film and a battery. the tripod is good for nightshots or when you need the camera to be still the film im using in my 35mm camera and the battery I threw away. for the price you cant go wrong 35mm or not.
4,Funky in all kinds of sizes,"This is another blowing session featuring Gene with some of the best young (at the time) hard-bop players in New York. ""Funky"" is a medium-slow blues, while ""King Size"" is taken medium-up and swings hard. The tunes really stretch out and everyone gets ample solo space. A solid date."
5,This book really helped me,I just turned eleven and my mommy and daddy just told me that they were going to get seperated. Mommy bought me this book and really helped me. I went through all of the exercises and after a month I feel so much better. I want to meet her and give her a big hug.
4,surprise dvd,"I won't be rewiewing the film itself, although I have always been a big fan of both the film and Ann Sheridan. I only would like to reassure the other fans that this is possibly the best print I have ever seen: it's not Criterion quality, but it's a notch or two above average. So if you wanna buy it, it's a good bargain."
5,What is this girl on?,"She is crazy! I saw her out here a few months ago. She had everyone going all night long. I had never bought a DJ Irene CD before, so after the show I went ahead and got ""Phonosynthesis"". It's definetely a one of a kind mix going from Hard House, Filtered House, to Trance, Progressive and even Drum & Bass. She had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole mix! If you want a mixed CD full of energy like no other, this is it!"
3,"Decent collection of radio edits, nothing major","Short radio edits of popular techno beats. I was disappointed, but I'll keep the cd around to maybe mix in my own versions of these tracks later."
5,HARDCORE,I just purchased this CD after hearing it at a friends house. It is by far one of the best CD's I have ever heard. The heavy hitting rythms and beats will pound into your head as you go crazy with excitement!!
1,The worst DJ set I've ever heard,"This is the worst DJ set that I have ever heard. Way too many songs for one cd. The songs are mixed togather poorly, very poorly. I give it one star only because there are a few good songs on it. She should have made a double cd, then I might give it three stars. A waste of money and plastic."
5,Very nice photos!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I have several Australia photo books, and this is definitely one of the better ones. Very nice photos, and good print quality."
5,Cadillac of Recliners,"This chaise is beautiful, comfortable and well constructed. It's a bit narrow, I'm a small person and I just fit between the arms. But the arms are padded, the pillow is a nice touch and the fabric is strong comfortable. Two small issues, it weighs a lot because its well built and the front doesn't fold down so you can sit up with your legs down. Overall a great chaise for home or the beach I'd buy another."
5,Turbo-Printer!!,"Not only is the AP2100 fast, it's beautiful. This printer shoots full size A3 paper out like a machine gun. But it's the high-res DPI that makes this printer great. I've had mine for three years and it has yet to disappoint.A great value for the price, especially against the HP Laserjet 5 and other printers in this speed a feature range."
2,Doesn't know what it wants to be,"Fun to drink once as a ""just try it"" drink but the herbs get tiring quickly. Not an everyday drink. Needs more juniper to make it a Winter time limited edition, sipping drink. ""Not bad"" is the immediate response but then I want to clean my mouth with a fresh tasting lighter beverage after half a bottle."
4,"Nice, for a change of pace","I really enjoyed Fentiman's Curiosity Cola when I was looking for something ""different"" in a drink. The flavor is robust, full bodied, and like nothing else I've ever tasted in a soda. The best way I could describe it is like Coke with a ""kick"" of spices. Make sure to drink it ice cold. Yum."
1,these stickers were bad,"they were bad because i couldn't separate the stickers to add them into my scrapbook, it's like all the stickers were stuck to the paper that it come on and most of the parts of the stickers weren't even cut right to be separated, it was very annoying to use these stickers, will never buy again, or recommend to a friend"
5,Army Men,This game is self-controlled pace game that is challenging to the end. It is tough. It comes with a training course to familiarize your weapons and vehicles. It is awesome.
3,"FUN, but ends too quick","This game rocks. It can be challenging at first to control. and hard to see some of the tan's on gameboy color, But all in all it is a fun game. The only disapointments i have/had with the game is that i finished it too quickly! Also, it isn't very replayable, for even thou you can change the level of hardness, it is still basicly the same game, with men in the same area's doing the same thing... also there wasn't not much tank time imho... yet, It was fun trying to find ways to get the men/tanks that keep killing you.just keep trying!p.s. to the can't find the tank guy... go south onto the hill, you'll see it come from the sw corner driving east... still can't find it? go to the map and see where a single man is sitting down south.. the tank will pass him.."
5,Songs 4 Worship Kids,"This CD has terrific worship songs for children. They are mostly easy songs, with beautiful melodies and great sccompaniment. I would highly reccomend this CD to other worship leaders of young childrenSincerely,Paula Mimnaugh"
1,Disappointing treatment of a great subject !!!,"I bought this book for my wife who has been an Oscar fan for 50 years or more. She found the book to be poorly written, poorly edited and it seemed to have a hangup on hippie type dresses. Her remark about the photos was ""there certainly must be a lot of glamourous type photos that could have been used""."
4,Good Songbook!!!,"This is a good companion to the United Methodist Hymnal, and also to many other hymnals!! There are more modern songs in it, and a lot of old standards, but on the whole, a more upbeat music. You can also purchase the soundtracks if your church doesn't have a musician. Perfect for a small church or even a larger one. (there is also a cd available with the lyrics in powerpoint for projection)"
1,The Print is way to small,The pop up window that displays the text is misleading. The type is much smaller than it appears on screen. Reading these bibles was difficult even for the folks with 20/20 vision.
3,Campy Christmas Curiosities,"Handmade puppets are the creepiest things on Earth and this X-MasDVD is full of em. Most of them have that over-blown dead pan expression sometimes found on the faces of serial killers or deranged clowns. The Santas (Santi/Santis) have that ""Yeah, I'mcrazy...but I'm getting paid to do this."" look. All in all this DVD is the tip of the iceberg of Campy X-Mas Curiosities out there. Most of the images were for kids but what kind of sicko parent would let their kids watch these things without suscumbingto juvenile depression or fear of X-Mas itself."
2,Sorta curious...but sadly not strange enough,I really wanted this to be the most cracked out video ever. Sadly it's mostly just pretty boring. It certainly has some weird and uncomfortable moments. But you have to sit throug a lot of boring footage. There's really not much payoff. Except Monkeys dressed as santa. And a really violent rendition of Punch and Judy that just makes you question humanity.
2,Not 'Strange' or 'Bizarre'... just disappointing!!!,"I agree with the reviewer 'MJ' here! This compilation was really promoted as being something truly odd and bizarre... and really I didn't find anything in the least bit interesting about it, and some segments were just plain boring!... plus at least 3-4 segments can be found on the longer compilation ""Holiday TV Classics"" dvd set. Unfortunately, not thinking, I didn't look at the reviews for this dvd here, and purchased it from another distributor (one learns from his mistakes!). Regarding the 'Punch and Judy' movie... gee I found it way less 'violent' than anything kids watch on TV now!"
2,Weird beyond belief,"I own at least two dozen Christmas movies and shows and was glad to find something that was completely new to me. I can't review this production as ""good"" (hence the 2 stars), but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed its novelty!"
4,Cool concept -- really works!,"Never has history been so fun, or so understandable. Gonick really adds substance to dates and facts and his subtle humor can really make you question about long-held beliefs you may have had. (Such as what did Solomon REALLY mean by his parable to cut the child in half?)I will admit that at times, the book seems a little stretched thin, as if he's hurrying to get through everything, but on the whole, Cartoon History of the Universe allows the student of history to gain a quick insight to the events that shaped our world."
5,A must for any home library!,"Want to read about history without reading about history? Buy this book! Not only does is serve up science in a way to keep you awake but it slices up history into easy to swallow portions too. If you find chapters or subjects that pique your interest beyond that provided by the witty cartoon panels, the book has the most extensive bibliography (with reviews!) you could ask for. I bought my copy many years ago and it drove me to reread all those Greek Classics that I slept through while I was in school! It is apparent that portions of the Ancient Greece section was drawn earlier when Mr. Gonick was developing his style. His wit is trenchant in all the chapters in a way to make the reader think. Summary: I wish I had this book when I was in school..."
5,From a student's point-of-view,"I'm currently taking a World Studies course and this book is a great complement! Everytime we finish a unit in school, I go back and read that section of the book. This book acts as a great review and it really reinforces some key points. The comics are also just hilarious to read. I'd definately reccomend A Cartoon History of the Universe for any students taking history courses that they mind find a bit dull. This book could really give you a new perspective."
5,Informative & Enjoyable,"This book reminded me of my 7th grade teacher, Mr Henderson, who taught history with such an interesting style, that 6 through 8th graders high - fived each other if they ""made"" it into his class. I too found that it accompanied me everywhere. I'd studied lots of history, but never so much in such a short time. Being an artist myself though, I'm dying to know what happened in volume 7? It appears that Larry Gonick either broke his hand or rushed the drawings.'Sup with that?"
5,Another gift purchase of this fun and fabulous history review!,"Our son found this book at a yard sale back when he was a teenager and loved it. 10+ years and a law degree later, he still says he learned more history from this book than from any history class in his school career. We've given several copies as gifts that have been very well received--for both boys and girls. If you are looking for an introduction to the series, this is the one to get. I believe it's the first in Gonick's series and it also the best."
5,A Must-Have book,"This is one of my most recommended books in my library. I give it as gifts and could rave on its merits for days. Don't walk, run and buy it. You will wish you had sooner."
2,Cartoon Editorials About History,"This book has excellent art, a great sense of humor and it responds to a great idea if it lived to its title, which it doesn't. This is not a work of history but a series of pictorial editorials, often times based on laughable and sorely dated sources, such as C.A. Diop's ""The African Origin of Civilization."" Women get unwarranted credit for inventions in a an effort to enhance their historical actual or imaginary roles, sundry events and figures are diminished simply because the author projects his contemporary outlook into the past, etc. In other words, this is just Gonick's Californian/Berkeley/San Francisco brand of illustrated activist soapboxing on history. Once your realize that, you might get an used copy and read it with a concomitant enormous block of salt by your side."
1,Objectionably Biased,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who absolutely raved about it. After reading it I was sorely disappointed. What began as an interesting scientific look at the beginings of the universe and the history of our planet degenerated into a one man diatribe. Gonick consistently puts his view point to the forefront denouncing anything that steps out of his accepted world view either through the text, or by poking fun at historical characters through ludicrous drawings. What could have been an entertaining way to present history to students is simply a volume of Gonick's personal propaganda. What material in the volume that is good is compromised by Gonick's persistence in inserting his bias into every single page. I realize that every history text is inherently interpretive, but to be an acceptable text it must make more of an attempt to be objective."
2,Poor Picture,I bought this charm for my daughter's bracelet. The picture on here is clear and a good representation. The charm itself is very light in color and poorly defined. A dissappointment.
1,DON'T GET IT!,"I know I gave this one star but still it's not the worst but anyway it's so hard to find your way around unless you learn how to use the map and you hardly have any wepons to begin with and the bad guys have pervect speed,wepons,and armor.So DON'T BUY THIS GAME!"
1,Why did they waste their time and make this game?,"Ok. I was very gullible when I was 9 years old... This game is the WORST game I have ever played. Yeah, when you first get it, you seem all excited about tanks and guns, but it only has 3 tanks! Maps aren't that great either. Keep your [money] and go buy a few rubber-duckies, because at least those are more fun that this!"
1,Do not buy from restockit,I did not recieve the cake stand pictured or discribed. what i recieved was a cheap no name stand that i dont think can hold up a cake. I returned the stand and it has been 2 months and have called over 10 times and still have not recieved a refund. They keep saying that they have not recieved the item back but i gave them the tracking number and ups said that it was delievered over a month ago. It seems that they are just out to rip people off. I can not believe that Amazon would deal with a compant like this.
3,Pretty good,"I thought the storyline of this is good. It gives you a glimpse of all the factors of racing. Even if it is negative. I figured all along that it was Jim and Joe involved in the drugging. It made me mad when the crowd booed Ashleigh in her races! That was when I wanted the mystery to solve right away. I noticed some minor mistakes in the book too. One is when they all first got to the track, a comment was made by Samantha, saying that they would be running tomorrow. But they never did. And another was Sammy was there for the morning workout,but then they mentioned she showed up, finally, to Belmont,later on that afternoon? Dates and times got screwed up in here. But nothing that is going to spoil the outcome of the book. Also, Ashleigh mentioned she was going to give them a surprise after the race. Even though I now what it is(just from reading the back of the book to #17) I still think they would have given off the surprise."
3,Get this straight!!!,"Alright, I love this series and I have all the books in it but some people need to get the facts right! Towsend Pride is not one of Wonder's foal's, he is her sire! Also, Townsend Prince is not Townsend Pride's sire, he is Townsend Pride's son! Also Cindy is just too fake! No 13 year old can control a full-grown racehorse, I have ridden a few retired thoroughbred racehorses myself and I know that they are not a piece of cake! Else the book is pretty good except for the fact that no horse can be as fast as Glory, and everyone looses a few! Well, I wish someone would change the facts in this book!"
4,Scary!!,I htink this book was awesome!! One thing I went to bed having nightmares. Great book!!!!!!!!!!!#1#1#1#1#1
1,not a happy gardener,"I bought a 61224 sprayer from A G Lock and Hardware, Brooklyn, NY, in Feb., 08. I used it once on 6 large and 4 small fruit trees and cleaned it with warm water and Dreft (that my garden supplier recommends.) In a month, I tried to use it again and found no pressure.My husband took it apart, wiped it down and replaced the gaskets in every combination possible (directions with sprayer not clear), but to no avail. I used a cheaper model from a local store the remainder of the season.In Jan., 09, I called A G Lock and Hardware to inquire about a replacement kit that their info with the sprayer said they had. They did not have this. They would not take this sprayer back because of the 30-day limit. They also said that they could not give me a number where I could order the replacement kit.I consider this poor service. I'll not do business with this store again. If you do order one of these, make sure that you use it more than once before the 30-day limit stops."
4,Trombone Sprayer,"I purchased the sprayer to clean mildew from my cement tile roof. The unit performed well. The extention tubesupplied, however, was poorly made and did not match the quality of the basic unit. For my use itwas not needed."
3,Manufacturing problems,"When I first used my trombone sprayer, there was some leakage where the spray nozzle joined the long pipe. I put some clear caulking in the area and let it dry thoroughly. There's no leak now and it works well."
3,"Hudson Trombone Sprayer works well, but....","This sprayer generally appears to be well made, and when I tested it with water it did indeed throw spray much further than my pump up sprayer -as I had hoped it would.I would be satisfied with the sprayer, except that I could not screw on the nozzle extension because the threads were poorly cut. When I complained to the seller, [...], I was told I would have to return the entire sprayer at my expense ($8). The seller did not respond to my objection to having to pay to return a defective product.I later called Hudson Manufacturing customer service in Hong Kong to see if there is a less expensive way to fix the sprayer. They told me to email them, and that they will connect me with someone in the USA who can help me with the defective part. I have not yet heard from Hudson in the US."
3,Useful information in a compromised package,"Note the small size of this atlas (7""x4.5""), and you'll understand the low cost. Therein lie many compromises. This atlas does continue a lot of useful information, but it often fails as a self-contained atlas. The biggest problem is the maps themselves, which are quite ""pixilated""; not sure if that's because of the way they were drawn, or something to do with the printing process. But the final effect is one that makes many of the maps difficult to use; I kept having to pull out a larger map or atlas to understand where it was that I was looking at on the Penguin map. I found the complete loss of artistic quality more troublesome than the actual loss in content. I learned using this atlas, but did not enjoy the experience.The atlas will surely fail to satisfy anyone that loves maps and higher quality atlases. We have to suppose this is an atlas meant for students, and for that purpose, it likely is a useful resource at a reasonable price."
3,Print too small,"I was rather disappointed when I receive the book. The print was too small. It serves well as a history ""dictionary"" but not if one wish to know more in detail. The paper and colour quality is rather good though."
3,Just like the ladies at the restaurant--the food was so bad and the portions were so small,"THE PRINT IS SO SMALL I COULDN'T READ IT WITHOUT A MAGNIFYING GLASS! Very inconvenient.The organization is confusing and there is not enough information on the Renassiance, the most important era in all of history. Other than that, I liked the book. There was a lot of information which was tangential to the information I was seeking and although distracting, interesting."
1,atlas review,I hate this book. Print is tiny. Info is cryptic. I waited too long to return it. Darn.
3,Daniel Magg - Facets,"Daniel Magg, one half of Worldless People, delivers his debut album, FACETS, a downtempo jazzy journey that manages to transverse the globe. ""O-Bah,"" for instance, takes an African-sounding vocal and warps it around some spotty electro-funk, while the congas go crazy on the thundering ""The Last Samba."" Then it's back to Africa for ""Yiy' Imbizo."" Elswhere, however, there's also some electro-soul that, while not bad, isn't quite as catchy as it should be (""Set for Seizure""), and some generic jazz-house (""Different Place""). For stronger and more cohesive house tracks, turn to ""Reminiscing"" or ""Sweep"" (for stronger electro, ""Electrica""). A mixed bag, but I suppose that's what happens when you happen to have many facets."
1,Not What was Advertised!,"I was dismayed when I received this DVD along with 2 other similar DVDs in the same order to find that unlike the covers shown in Amazon.com, the dvds are actually cable versions and not the adult unrated versions as suggested.Beware and save your money!"
2,Inconsistent watering,"I bought it because it was advertised for use to water ""small areas"" which is what I needed, but didn't really like this product. The watering pattern was sloppy and inconsistent, and water pooled up in the area immediately around the sprinkler. Try instead the Gardena 8125 Minizoom Oscillating Sprinker (also designed for small areas), which I am very satisfied with. . ."
4,Excellent Value,"This is my second purchase. After trying this sprinkler, I trashed all the rest! MUCH easier to change the spray pattern than change sprinklers when you move it around the yard."
2,Light and flimsy,"It's just little holes drilled into plastic. Attach a hose and it flops over on it's side. It weighs about as much as a pencil. I had to weigh it down with a big rock on the ""handle"" then prop up the hose. Will probably last one season then spend another five hundred years in a landfill."
4,The ones you want (hopefully) by the letter...,"This book is a faithful recreation of some of JP's best hits. It includes the songs that get the most radio airplay, but not necessarily the best tracks that they ever recorded.The tab in this book is nicely done, and seems to be about right (makes my guitar sound pretty much like the albums). I knocked it down one star because the book is bound in the standard fashion, meaning that I had to crack the spine to get it to sit flat on my music stand. Also, there wasn't a musical notation legend or introduction, which are always nice.If you are a JP fan, this will get you going pretty well."
4,Best of Judas Priest (Guitar Recorded Version),This is a good book for guitarist trying to learn some of the more popular Judas Priest tunes. I've compared most of the transcriptions in the book to the recordings and the Tabs seem accurate. My biggest complaint with this book is there is nothing transcribed from the Sad Wings of Destiny or Sin After Sin albums. IMO the songs from the Ripper Owen period could have easily been left out and replaced with some of their earlier material. One sidenote. There is a book out there titled :Judas priest-The early Years Supertab. the book is 76 pg and was published by Warner Bros. This book is absolute rubbish. Every transcription is incomplete and wrong.
4,Glad to have found this DVD,"The Brontes are seen as they were, very extraordinary people living very ordinary lives. The film does an excellent job in getting that point across. As was true of their day, the family's hopes and dreams were set on the son who was never able to fulfill his destiny. Melancholy and sadness abound but it was true of the Brontes' lives. A very good film indeed."
1,Couldn't get through the first CD,Sad because I love Michael Kitchen. I tired very hard to watch it but found I'd just drift off. I couldn't fathom what was going on. I've been to Haworth and thought this would be jam packed with lovely Yorkshire scenery but I think it was filmed in someone's living room on the Moors.
2,English drama,"The acting was poor and the cast was one of the worst, I have evern seen. It did not compare with Cramford or Mansfied Park aqll three edition that I have seen. Al Ryan"
2,No Not to my liking,"Very surprised at this DVD Did not enjoy it at all..didn't grab my attention, very slow, was it true to life.. hmmm not in my review"
5,Dorman 800-071,"I used this Dorman Fuel line to repair my 1999 Saab 9-3 check valve line to the fuel filter. It's an easy way without dropping the fuel tank to route the fuel line down to the fuel filter and use the Dorman 800-301 fuel line repair kit to push the connectors into the Nylon line. The connector barbs at the fuel filter are smaller than the check valve barbs. It was a life saver as far as I am concerned, my tank was full and the tank straps were rusted over at the bolts so the fuel line is a real time and money saver in the long run."
5,MORENO IS THE SOUND OF OUR GENERATION!,He mixes Fania with Beatles with radiohead with oldschool cuba.Some people still dismiss this guy as a pretty boy and he is but the boys got some pretty incredible talent!! this cd rocks.
5,Not a new tool simply a mindset...,"Mr. Newman's book does a wonderful job of sensitivly expressing what many in the church have probably felt for a long time...we many times in our relationships talk TOO much and listen very little. His suggestion that we not learn a new tool but carry a mindset of the use of questions in our relationships is insighful (something used for thousands of years by Rabbi all over the world). He really does expound on the Scripture of being quick to listen and slow to speak.His chapters on the problem of evil and homosexuality are compelling making one anxious for the next conversation with a friend. And I have to say this book contains one of the best chapters I have ever read on the issue of evangelism...""when is it time to shut up?"" A question I don't think I have ever heard in the Church.Be prepared to be challenged by the insight's Mr Newman makes in ""Questioning Evangelism""."
4,Only a thing or two to add...,"There are a lot of very compelling reviews about this book, so I won't say a lot here. But I appreciate Newman's ability to offer his method and apologetic without trashing the other methods. His history in Campus Crusade has obviously given him a passion for sharing the Gospel message, and that passion comes through loud and clear in this book.On the otherhand, Newman frees the reader/evangelist/disciple to listen and ask thought provoking questions rather than always filling in the blanks for people. So much teaching/learning in modern Christianity is done by filling in blanks...it's a shame we don't think more. This book encourages thinking.I particularly appreciate the author's personal Jewish history shared throughout the book, those facts and stories are enlightening, helpful and at times humorous. I'm really enjoying this book."
1,Well in the words of Jesus...Sail Away!,"Evagelism in America, where we had food to eat and didnt have to run through the porverbial jungle and scuff up our feet, harkens to the early forms of orality. And Mr. Newman does a smashing job preaching to the ""short people"" of the United States. In other words this book is intended for"
4,Good change of perspective.,"A great approach to reaching out with the gospel. I especially liked the chapter on marriage as that is so topical ( for me ) at the moment.Seriously recommend this as well written,thought out and presented.Well worth the purchase.Rob."
2,Not enough Norah Jones,"The only reason I picked up this album was the name Norah Jones. I was expecting to hear her at the forefront, and I didn't really. To be honest, I was hoping to hear more of what she sounded like in Come Away With Me and Feels Like Home. If you're looking for Norah Jones, this isn't really the album you're looking for."
4,The girl grew up,"I have many feelings in my head about this album. But the strongest is the feeling that somehow Norah grew up and her voice that used to be nice and charm now is sexy and a bit spicy.This is not a Norah Jone's album. This is a very well done experiment. The chill out, ambient sounds and some electronic effects mixed here, are extremely smoothed by Norah's voice.If you like Norah Jones and Chill out, what are you waiting for? put your hands on this!!One last advice, please don't listen this album while you are roasting the BBQ, don't be mean!. Take your time, relax and enjoy it."
4,"good burner, sent missing part and stripped screw","The burner is awesome, I use it for my home brew set up. It was sent without the heat shield and the bottom screw was completely stripped out by whoever assembled it. Other than that it can fire up 13 gallons of wort into a solid boil for 90 minutes."
5,Awesome burner,"Bought this to do home brewing beer. This is a very well made propane burner that quickly heats five gallons of water for brewing. It also can do lower temps, great for steeping grains. It was easily assembled and is very sturdy on the four feet. Solid steel construction. One word of warning, this thing is big. Make sure you have storage space for it."
4,Bayou Classic SQ14 burner,"Good burner for the price, I use it for tailgatin at LSU. Ive heard it would be great for brewing your own beer, which I may try in the future."
4,Great burners and good quality,I bought 2 of these for a chili cook off to make 10 gallons of chili. They worked great and heated up quick. The only issue I see and could be fixed by making something for them is during the cook off it was very windy and hard to keep the flame going at some times - if you could build something to go around where the gas comes out to keep wind out woudl be great. The frame is very well built though - we had 5 gallon brew kettles on them and no issues or worrying about them tipping over.
3,not in stock,The description neglects to tell you that a regulator hose kit is required but sold separately. Unfortunately it is not in stock and has not been in stock here too. I'm still awaiting an email to tell me otherwise.
3,"Works well, but smells terrible the first time","The burner works very well, but the paint/powder coating on the stand burns off during the first use and gives off a pretty toxic smell. I would suggest giving it a good test burn before using it for cooking or brewing. After a while the smell decreased and the paint chips flaked off.I use mine for homebrewing and it had no trouble boiling more than five gallons in a reasonable amount of time. It is susceptible to the flame being blown around if it is at all windy, but that's probably true with most outdoor burners. I would recommend this burner, just watch out for the burn off the first time."
4,Lots of heating power.,"I've been using this nearly 2 years and am impressed with how quickly it can heat a large pot of liquid. I primarily use this for beer brewing and am very happy with it. My only complaint is that it needs some type of wind baffle. I find that in moderate wind the flames can be blown out if it is not set on a very high setting. Other than that, it is extremely sturdy and much stronger than many similar models."
5,Sturdy Stove,"I bought this outdoor patio stove to use for my pressure canner and I am very happy with my purchase. It easily hooks up to my standard size propane tank, easy to light and easy to maintain the flame. Great product!"
4,Missing parts,"The screw that attaches the burner to the base was missing. Had to go to Home Depot to buy a replacement. Did not try to get one from the seller, going to Home Depot was easier. This is my second SQ14. I needed two and both work great for 5-10 gallons of home brew."
4,Great Homebrew Burner,"Great burner. Heats water quicker than my previous burner. Big and stable. It holds my keggle very well. One of the legs looks to be bent in a little bit, but it still holds pretty firm. I'll bend it back the next time I use it. I am a little wary of how the product could sway in one direction versus the other direction. If you look at the pic, it is stable if you try to sway it left to right, but it has some give when you try to sway it from front to back due to the design. Overall, I am happy with it and I would recommend it. Many burners will not work for a standard keggle and this one easily does."
2,It makes heat,Bought this for 7 gallon home brew boils. Had I known it would take an hour to get from 150 mash temp to a boil I would have sprung for a bigger burner. Maybe I got a dud because all of the reviews I read said it was a good burner. The company website doesn't offer much information for an troubelshooting.
5,Great product,"I use this burner in my homebrew set up. It easily produces enough heat to bring ~12gal of liquid to a nice boil fairly quickly. The stand, obviously, can support all that liquid weight plus the weight of the keg that I use for my brew kettle, more than 120 pounds! Really-great product; and no assembly required."
3,"Powerful burner, mediocre wind protection","This burner came mostly assembled with no damage or missing parts.I brew beer with this burner and can bring 6-7 gallons to a boil in a flash. It impossible to get a good flame with the knob opened all the way, but once you find the sweet spot it is more than enough for most uses. Based on the pictures I imagined this to have better wind protection than it does. The square box frame is too far from the burner to help in this regard. I probably would now select a different model, but at least it does make stuff hot in a hurry."
4,Perfect for what I needed,"I bought this to cook things like lobsters or fried chicken that I don't like to cook indoors because of the smell. It can accommodate HUGE pots and pans. The flame is powerful. The unit is short but stable. Just be aware that it is definitely low-tech. The only way to control the flame is with a dial-type gas gauge and then if you adjust the gas pressure up or down, you have to tweak an air intake valve to maintain a good quality (i.e. blue, not yellow) flame. It took me a few minutes to get the hang of maintaining my oil temperature. Great product, though."
5,Bayou Classic gets it hot while being sturdy,"I bought this for my homebrew set up and couldn't be happier. It is VERY sturdy, easy to put together, and heats up 15 gallons of water in no time. The big top is great for bigger pots, or drilled out kegs, and doesn't take up too much space in the garage. Don't go with other burners, this thing is a beast and pretty inexpensive."
4,Happy Home Brewer,I have used it 2x and its be great. I am on my way to creating my little home brewery and this was a must have
4,Great for homebrewing!,"I bought this specifically for homebrewing with my 15.5 gallon Keggle. I was using a turkey fryer setup from my local home store, but the Keggle wouldn't sit on it very well with its rounded bottom. After reading some of the other reviews I knew this was the one for me. I wasn't disappointed! The Keggle fits perfectly on here, tested a boil and got 7 gallons of water from around 60 degrees to a full boil in 30 minutes using the 10 psi regulator wide open. For my purposes this will work perfectly, the frame is very sturdy and assembly was very easy. You really can't go wrong with the SQ14 for the price, a must have for beginning / intermediate homebrewers!"
3,Somewhat ok,"The pressure isn't strong enough to be able to fry, going to return it. When i put the gas on max, it goes out. Guessing its the 10 psi. Otherwise its awesome, would recommend for slow cooking big serving meals. But if you want to cook fast and fry, this is not the way to go."
5,"good, Really good!","First time i listened to this band i had no idea what to expect, but from what i read hear; they sounded pretty good. I just bought the cd because they had a funny sounding name, I keep going back to this cd after not listening to it for a while; it just has that addictive sound to it. weeeeeeeeee."
3,Not very original. But meh....,"more like 2 1/2 stars. I actually hated it at first, But its just so damn catchy it sticks in your head. Although pretty hard to take serious(lame ass lyrics) it's a fun album, its very accessible and you don't have to think about the lyrics too much. But yea, buy it used."
1,just what the world don't need,"Thanx lollipop guild.perpetuating the gray grunge of 92no sexjust macho boys club with faux hostility.no more moaningplease, someone make the bad people stop"
1,Why do people like Lollipop?,"Why do people like Lollipop?Being a native of the hometown of Lollipop, Toledo, OH, where people LOVE this band, I should know the answer to this question. But, alas, I can't figure it out for the life of me. Anti-climatic, cliched, hateful metal is what this is. I see no point to it. First of all, their theme of murder is offensive. Especially when a member of your family has been brutally murdered. Don't trivialize something so disgusting. Secondly, their music is completely flat...that's what happens when you try to be heavy throughout an entire song. It's boring. Thirdly, this style and the topic of the lyrics has become a cliche these days. It may have been cool and interesting when it was original back in '96, but it's just old and worn out today. Where's the originality? How can this be considered art? As a musician and artist in Toledo, I want to say that not everything out of Toledo is this bad."
1,Totally Unoriginal,"Let's see which bands Lollipop Lust Kill steals from:Tool, Marilyn Manson, Spineshank, Mindless Self Indulgence...The material is just unoriginal. It's all been done before. I'd only download ""Like A Disease"" off Napster or some other online music store. The Depeche Mode cover isn't that great either. I don't recommend this at all. Sorry."
5,Wow! Great Metal Band!,"All I can say for this band is wow. I come from Louisville, Kentucky, and have had numerous people come up to me from their Street Team and offer their CD. Of course I took it, and havent been displeased!They sing like Drowning Pool, but yet have a guitarist that playes just like Metallica. A definete MUST for all metal lovers!"
4,"Good, but not necessarily unique","Well, I got this album because I heard one or two songs off of it a while back, and it was cheap, so I figured, why not. The music is good and has its own sound and approach, but many of the songs run together and its difficult to tell certain songs apart from each other. Some good stand out songs are: Black All Over, Sad Excuse for A Grip, and Can't Get Away. The cover of ""Personal Jesus"" is alright, nothing spectacular."
4,F==KING AWESOME BAND!,"Ok I've seen them live 2 times and this friday the 13th I'm gonna see them again, great at Coal Chamber and I saw them in Chi Town with Murderdolls both great they really get the Milwaukee crowd up on they're feet. But if your a metal fand straight up this album is for you features great songs such as Burnt Black, Like a Disease, Fater, Everything I, and a great and I mean F==king awesome cover of Personal Jesus in a Marilyn Manson sort of way... other wise what can I say people do say they sound like disturbed but truth is they blow Disturbed outta the water and put them to shame... so do yourself a favor and pick up this album you won't regret it."
5,This Album Rules,I saw them at WWE New York on July 23. They opened for 5 Point 0Medication and Coal Chamber. They blew 5 Point 0 and Medication away. There cd is amazing and anyone who is into more of the heavy rock/metal genre should definitely pick it up.
5,Good Product,"urchased two of these for different vehicles, they are built well and are purportedly 'lifetime' filters with the correct maintenance.I bought these with a rebate and actually ended up getting both for free, can't beat that.Not much you can say about an air cleaner except that it works and fits well, I haven't had to clean it yet but I did see the cleaning kit was fairly reasonable unlike the K&N; models."
2,Historic yet Overated,"Being a student and collector of Classic Soul for over 30 years I must say it has historical value as far as some artists being seen together ""Live"" for the last time. Yet the performances themselves were completely lackluster. The band was weak to say the least and Mary Wells doesn't even seem to enthused about singing her songs, ( she constantly asks the audience to sing along, completely dropping her vocals), not to mention a very weak sounding voice and band."
3,Eddie and David are the Stars,"Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin were wonderful. Although past their prime by 1987, Eddie was very energetic and sounded great when he sang in his natural tenor vs. the falsetto. He and David performed well together. Martha Reeves' and Mary Wells' performances were not worth watching after the first viewing. I have watched Eddie's and David's performances many times. The DVD is well worth the money if you are fans of Eddie and David."
3,Very Dry. Very informative as well.,"First- this book is about the El Camino Real in Louisiana. It is very informative. However, it is very dry reading. If you are interested in Louisiana history, this book would be a useful one to have because this area was very important in the history of Louisiana. The main reason I rated it three stars is that there is some assumption you know who/what the author is talking about and without prior information from other sources, you might not know this information. Sometimes that made if difficult for me to read because I was finding myself looking up names or places or events in other books to get a background on what the author was talking about in this book. Overall though, this book is very informative."
4,DJ Paul Underground Vol.16 rerelease,"All I have to say 'bout this album is straight bump. Paul refreshes old classics from his underground days. My favs off this junt is Back Da F**k Back, Kickin' In Doe/I Think They Scared, and King of Kingz. This album is solid for his first solo release with full scale exposure . A must for true Three 6 Mafia fans like myself.DJ Paul KING OF MEMPHIS da king 4-LiFe"
4,Pretty pictures.,The non-working of the plot is worse then in the other volumes. The Guys behave like teenage girls. Pschychic characters from other comics show up in the Binki's storyline once again.I am only reading this for pretty fictional boys kissing.
5,Don't listen to reviewer number 1!!,Fake 3 was just as good as the first two mangas. In this volume you do learn alot about Ryo and how hard his parents murders were makin g him feel. Dee as always was there for him when needed. Which in my opinion was very sweet! Buy the book! You most definately won't regret it. Ja-ne
4,Fun as always,"Another fun entry in this series. I didn't enjoy this one as much as #4 but it was still a solid entry in the series. This time the boys are investigating a murder case that has ties back to Ryo and tests his kinder, gentler nature (at least in comparison to Dee). Bikky and Carol (who start the book at 10 & 13 and age to 15 & 18 in the last chapter)interrupt Dee's latest attempt to deflower Ryo. JJ appears for some comic relief. These are fun, over the top books."
2,REO Speedwagon,"I Bought this DVD thinking they were music videos, I enjoy the music but there's nothing to watch. Disappointing at best."
4,Fly Eagles Fly,"This movie covers the Eagles 2004 football season. It showcases more of the fan's passion for the Eagles then anything else, and as a fellow Eagles fan, I enjoyed it. Though I wish they showed a bit more of actual Eagles footage then multiple parties in fan's homes."
4,3-section olive dish,"After looking at several sites, this dish seemed to fit my needs. Very well-made, 3 compartments, and nicely colored. Price was a little high."
5,A very complete book,This is the most compete book I ever had about the german Iron cross. It is fully illustrated with a lot of details. It will helps a lot those who begin a medal collection. The other book about the same subject are often uncomplete and poor illustrated. It is a plus for a good military collection.
4,Halogen Portable Power Light,"I would recommend this light to most buyers. It is easy to assemble and easy to use. My biggest problem is that it gets super hot... (duhh), and I'm mentioning this because I used it in a barn while working on my horses' feet. You must be careful where you put this guy, as it was so hot after I finished, if I missed the handle and touched the metal... ouch! This is probably stupid to most people, but I just wanted to mention it. I like the light, and will continue to use it, just using more caution."
2,The Art of Classic Quiltmaking,This book is a must for anyone's library whether you are an experienced quilter or a beginner. There is so much information we forget or maybe didn't learn when we starting quilting. I have recommended this book to my students who are just beginning to enter the quilting world. It is wonderful.
5,My daughteer couldn't put it down,I loved this book from the very beginning but was entirely convinced it was a winner when my married daughter sat down to look at it. She has never done quilting and was excited by the book and loved it! She felt it was easy to understand and something she would buy. We both loved the style of the quilts and jumpstarted our imaginations.
5,"Packed with basic, clearly presented information!","This provides quilting basics, but also goes beyond them to provide a complete reference guide and project book. From choosing equipment and supplies to selecting designs and calculating yardage, this is packed with basic information."
1,"Good book, but for political influences","The book starts off as a good historical narrative of the issues involved; however, the writers extreme left wing tendencies soon become apparentThe book is basically a rebuke of India's nuclear weapon programme. The book would have been much better if the authors did not spend so much time criticising India for what is essentially an act of self defence. the writers fail to take into account India's security problems, as well as the problems it faces against terrorism. it also fails to speak of hostile comments made by Pakistani and Chinese officials thratening India"
1,Biased rambling of the Fringe Left,"Arundhati Roy and Praful Bidwai are well known anti Hindu, anti India writers with prolific track record of biased vitriolic outbursts.The central theme of the book is to take a few facts and put an overdose of fringe left opinions. The net result is to make India seem responsible for nuclear proliferation in the world.The writers have tried to equate India with Pakistan. The fact that Indian nuclear program started as an Indian response after Indian defeat in Indo China war of 1962 and Chinese nuclear program has been very conveniently discounted.This flaw alone seriously discounts any scholarship of the work. This book is suitable for preaching to the converted. If you are looking for another view point to the Indian nuclear program, you will be sorely disappointed."
4,Pretty Good,Ashleigh's Farewell is a pretty good book but it is not my favorite.The beginings in this book are great but the ends of the chapters are to cut off.
2,Well...um...,"What can I say? The story kind of doesn't make sence. Like, if Ashleigh was pregnant, why did she ride Glory one day, fall off then suddenly not ride? My my mom was pregnant with me, she ride till she was 8 months along! Like come on!Another thing about this book is that Glory feaks out with all the other riders. Sure, when I broke my arm and some of my friends rode my horse, he had to get used to there differnt(sp?) riding style, but gallop around and toss them this way and that...um...no. Never.This book bearly got any stars from me, but I'll be nice cause I like Cindy and Glory *Sometimes*"
2,snore!,I'm a die hard Thoroughbred fan & I read almost every book i pick up but this one was so boring I was getting a migrane from trying to read it! When Ashleigh tells everyone she's going to have a baby all Cindy can think about is who will ride Glory! What a snob! Shouldn't she be happy for Ahsleigh & Mike! I think they made WAY too many books on Cindy.
1,Well...,"In Cindy's Honor Ashleigh can't ride Honor Bright because she is pregnant again. Why doesn't Ashleigh just be pregnant one time only with twins? Horses can't be so picky can they? It's like, Star can't win without Christina. Ashleigh also was dwelling on about how she couldn't ride Glory because of the risk of losing her baby. Well, how come the exercised him that day? How about that? Also, why in the world would Ashleigh sell off a half-interest in Glory to Townsend Acres, I will never know. That will only make the deal with Wonder's offspring tougher, I mean, Ashleigh would have to deal with two major fights with the Townsends because she sold of a half-interest in Glory. So, if you want to read this book, first look at the reviews!"
4,O.k.,"i got excited too about Ashleigh's baby, but guess what it never comes. The books skip 10 years and the baby is never mentioned again. What is the point of this book if its not followed through. PUH-LEASE!"
2,Not the real thing ....,"This is definitely not the real thing. This is a luke warm copy...with a face, some moves and music ""produced"" to be MTV generation compatible eyeing the non-latin market.... but forget packageing and dig the real stuff, from which this youngster is living off: Los Hermanos Rosarios and ""El Cuco"", . Definitely not your MTV faces, because they are ""feo""...., but much hotter...."
5,If you're Canadian and live in the U.S. read this book!,"If you have been living in the United States as a ""Star Spangled Canadian"" for any length of time you must read this book. You will identify with a lot of the Canadians who were interviewed by Jeffrey Simpson for his book. Some of the reasons that they give for making the move to the States will be the same as yours, as well as the challenges they faced over the years. Simpson offers and interesting perspective on the ""brain-drain"" and a lot of facts and figured that will surprise you."
1,Ode to Canadian anti-Americanism,"Where do I begin... Just one more in on a very long list of America bashing Canadians (though simpson is American born,Canadian raised). I purchased this book in hopes that it would somehow give me some insight on just whats going on with my America-hating, Canadian husband who's has appaently been forced to live in the U.S. for the past 23 years (otherwise he's surely leave....right?). This book was just more of the same old, same old. The books starts out well enough, but then it goes on and on about how Canadians are so much better educated than Americans, and that their healthcare system is superior to ours, and that Canada's crime rates are nearly nill by comparison. Chapter, after chapter, after chapter of U.S./Canadian comparisons that lead nowhere. So much anti-Americanism in a book with such a title. Go figure. The $3 bucks I paid for this drivel was a rip-off.Move on people.......nothing to see here."
4,Great album...,"This CD was mastered from a vinyl transfer. I understand the master tapes could have been lost somewhere along the line. It's a nice sounding needle drop, if a bit thin with a surprisingly bright top end, but most of the residual vinyl sound has been cleaned away leaving an adequate sounding CD.Maybe someday the tapes will resurface but until then this CD is pleasant enough."
5,Just the bible I was looking for!,"This woman's bible has exceeded ALL of my expectations! My only regret is that I didn't buy another one for my daughter. Now it no longer available. It was intended as a temporary bible until I could afford the bible I thought I really wanted. The articles and topical notes are enlightening and, for me provides a clear understanding of the scriptures and the stories of the people in the bible. Although other might criticize the articles on the subjects of interest to women as being the opinion of the authors, I personally find them extremely helpful, as I don't consider the bible to be just another book. This bible works for me and if could obtain multiple copies, I would definitely purchase them for other women in my family and circle of friends. Great bible, fantastic price!"
1,The Worst X-Men crossover ever!,"This comic series has good art and action. But that's it. I'm a long time X-Men fan...and this is not the X-Men! The story totally goes against the past X-Men history. The X-Men and Magneto's actions go against their personality traits just to further an already stupid plot. The thing that made Magneto great was because he was a deadly adversary who deep down was a good man. Yet here, he is played out as totally evil and sadistic. If you're a fan of the X-Men, DON'T read this!"
5,Ya liked Onslaught? Ya gotta have this.,This is a great way to get one of the most important parts of Xmythology - Magneto ripping out Wolvies admantium and Xavier displaying the anger that resulted in onslaught.This one you have to read to understand Magneto/Xavier and Onslaught.
4,HP Media Vault -- fast but not fully compatible,"The HP Media Vault is a fast, reliable network attached storage device. It came with a 300 GB SATA drive and I easily added a second drive.The 6 computers in my home office network easily recognized the device and it was a snap to provide shared storage for everything from music to backups.The one problem with this device is with the backup software. It was not readily apparent to me nor to the first 2 technicians I spoke with from HP, that the backup software will not work with Windows 2003 Server. Although the servers can copy files to and from the media vault, NTI Shadow is incompatible with Microsoft's server software. It would have been nice to know that up front."
4,Easy to install. So far so good!,"Having tried several network storage devices including Netgear and Linksys I have found the HP Media Vault easier to use, easier to set up and more reliable.I've also attached a portable USB powered hard drive to the HP Media Vault which is working fine. Haven't tried to install an additional SATA hard drive yet or a USB printer.I've used the device for about 1-month and haven't had any major problems or difficulties setting up or using the device so far.Would recommend this product!"
5,HP Media Vault--good choice for networked backup device,"Was easy to install on my home network (Netgear 801.11g router) even though the user manual was a bit intimidating. I capture and edit lots of digital photos and video of family outings and vacations. The HP Media Vault has provided me with a piece of mind by allowing me to back-up on an external device separate from my home office desktop PC. I used to use a Western Digital USB hard drive for backup storage. Since the Media Vault is networked, I can access my photos, music and videos wirelessly on my notebook or in my living room with my Media Center PC. This is something external hard drives do not offer. The product is apparently expandable and supports RAID 1 (mirroring), but I have not tried adding a second HDD yet. My only complaint is that the HP device looks a little too much like a PC."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This battery is a knock-off version of the Nokia ones. The casing is too thick so the battery itself does not make any contact with the phone. Therefore no electricity actually gets to the phone. This battery is useless. DO NOT BUY. Don't try to skimp like I did, get the real battery made by Nokia."
3,Work well when they stay on.,"The adhesive on these isn't so great. They stick well at first, but if you slide the chair they are attached to often enough they start to slide off. They do a very good job of keeping your floors scratch free, but only as long as they stay on."
3,Not designed for furniture,"These felt pads are certainly heavy duty and quite thick, but therein lies the problem. The package describes usage as for appliances and small items that you need to protect your delicate surfaces from. Due to thickness and the limits of adhesion to the surface, placing these under table legs or couch feet isn't a long term solution. If you move the item, they will shear away from the surface. Felt designed for furniture is usually much thinner with a strong adhesive.Bottom line: Great for lamps, small appliances, coasters, but not useful for furniture including couches/chairs/tables."
5,Felt Pads,"Perfect product. They fit nicely on the bottom of all my bar stools, sectional couch, coffee table and tv stand. They protect my soft wood floor from scuffs and scratches!Only complaint is that the adhesive doesn't hold very well on the bottom of my chair legs, but a little superglue did the trick.Strongly recommend!"
1,Waste of money,"These things would not slide on the hardwood floors very well the kids complained. After a couple weeks they started coming off, when I tried to put back on they still did not stay on. They are not heavy duty if they just fall off, maybe I can use for things that stay in one place. I bought the miracle glide that screw on, they stay on and last for a few years."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Needed these to put under a new bed so I could slide it out from the wall. Exactly what I needed, great price and pretty good quality. Would recommend them."
1,Dont stick to chair's legs,"These things are falling of the legs of my office chair every day, they don't keep on sticking don there - not recommended for this purpose. It is a simple office chair which is moved back and forth to sit down or get out from the office desk on a wooden floor. Expected better performance."
1,Not Good...,Purchase in December 2011.... and here I'm looking for something to replace them they come off and my wood floor are getting damage........... I do not recommend
1,Never got my order!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"40 days after my original order and I am still waiting to receive my (4) packages of Waxman 7284 ---- I contacted Janns a number of times ---- but they are no longer replying to my emails ----- looks like I am ""out"" my $12 ------ but at this point I can no longer afford to invest my time complaining about a $12 order"
3,they are okay,"bought these for my couch and coffee table. they don't work well for heavy furniture, but do for lighter furniture."
3,these do not stick,"these do not stick so well and I am again searching for something to protect my new wood floors from excesive scratches, I am not sure what to get yet."
3,Its simple and does the job.,"I wish is would have come with nails, but its hangs up on the wall fine. The hooks are very close to each other. It does the job and at 15 bucks it seems fair. I would recommend to friends."
4,Informative introduction to Italian culture,"I was fortunate enough to have Fedi himself (one of the writers of this book) as a professor. Although the introductory chapters are slow-going, there is a lot of information that would ordinarily not be found in a typical 400-level ITL textbook.Fedi and Fasoli use contemporary examples to enrich these lessons: excerpts from well-known (and not so well-known) films, advertisements from IKEA, and web-group message boards are just a few of the pedagogic devices that make this text brilliantly accessible.Although much of the content seems topical, I guarantee that this book will stand the test of time for several years.I also want to add: this book has an EXCELLENT vocabulary -- even if you are a native speaker you will learn some new words from this book.Highly recommended for advanced learners of Italian."
1,Not worth it,"I ordered this book used. First time I have done that and I am sorry that I did. It arrived and as I thumbed through the pages I see that the prior owner used a pen to write notes on practically every single page including her homework assignment. I don't consider this acceptable. There are also orange, blue and green markers on almost every page over certain words.This book should have never been put on the market. I am having to scratch out all of the previous owners notes, and also I ran out of white out to get rid of some of the note.I will NEVER order another book from Amazon again. They should be ashamed of themselves putting this book out for sale."
2,Not worth it,Cute and would be excellent if the battery didn't die way faster than you could even get through a movie.
5,Would purchase another!,"We purchased the Batman Portable DVD player for our 4 year old son's Birthday. What a great purchase. We let him take it with us to the grocery store or the mall, keeps him entertained long enough for us to get done what we need to get done. He is able to operate the Player on his own, so he can change the disks as he needs to in the car, which is a big help while I am driving. Great purchase especially considering we only paid $45.00. Make sure you read the instructions and charge the battery as directed, it takes a couple of charges to get the battery to hold its full charge. I would recommend this to anyone!"
4,perfect career overview,"As it starts with 14 key tracks recorded with the band The Sorrows , this 2 cd set provides an excellent overview of Fardon's under-appreciated career. A unique voice on the beat beat , Fardon's vocals are strong throughout this collection.With selections from 1965 to a newly recorded 2005 version of ""Bellfast Boy"" (the original is also included) , this sums up 41 years quite nicely at an attractive price. Pick it up !"
4,Great book to generate ideas for book-marketing,"This is a great book with many ideas on where to market your book other then the bookstores. Very inspiring and yes, a notebook is needed to make notes for your own book marketing specifically. I missed some practical information on how to reach the right person in a company to pitch too, but overall a must-have for every writer."
1,Ugh...waste of time...,"The characters are caricatures, they have no redeeming qualities, and you are told, rather than shown their redeeming characteristics. The illicit love affair is TOTALLY unbelievable, as you're never given ANY reason to think why these two are drawn together.I even reread the last 20-30 pages to see if I missed a big ""aha"". Nope..that's how it's written. This book is flat, lifeless and poorly written."
1,Not Up To Par,"The author must be using a ghost writer these days. The book was not anywhere near the quality of past books. Characters were shallow and scenes were redundant. I kept hoping it would get better, but never did."
1,Looking Bleak,"I have read other Belva Plain novels, so I was so surprised at this one. It was so disappointing!! The characters were not in the least sympathetic. In fact, I think I ended up despising each and every one of them!I had a hard time believing the story took place in the no so distant past (or at least not in the 50's or 60's), because the characters' attitudes (male & female) toward women with careers was so dated!"
1,Looking Back,"What a disappoint. Don't bother paying full price for this book! The first half is not too bad but 50 pages of a leading character wringing her hands, saying over and over (and over!), ""I just don't know what to do!"" is too much.The ending was totally unbelievable. A real estate agent who only sold houses in the past, suddenly recovers from a breakdown and finds the necessary funding for a major public development, based on the architectural plans which took almost two years to develop by a professional architect but were stolen (and believed to be designed!) by the realor's sister who teaches Latin? Creditable?Save your money. Don't bother!"
2,This Can't Be The Recommended Author(?),"Belva Plain came highly recommended, and my book club chose ""Looking Back"" for the month's selection. Many of the ladies in the book club had read Belva Plain previously and had loved everything they read.That said, I was sorely disappointed in ""Looking Back."" It read like a shallow romance....and that was evident from the very beginning. There's the pretty girl from bad roots, the elegant rich girl, and the rich girl with too-large calves. They're all friends in college and begin their adult lives near each other.The story is so obvious. You know what's going to happen before it happens. You don't guess what's going to happen -- you KNOW what's going to happen. The book truly has zero depth.The writing style isn't special. The characters are under-developed. My recommendation is to move on to another book before even wasting your time."
2,"I liked the beginning, but...","hated the end. The final 50 pages or so were just awful in my opinion. I was following the story, although I didn't really strongly like or identify with any individual character, but Amanda's ""announcement"" and everything that followed...well, it all just left me feeling very dissatisfied. Several characters acted in ways you would not have expected, and moving characters that had been somewhat peripheral to the forefront nearly at the end of the book just felt contrived. I also found it hard to believe that Amanda would have made the final choices that she did without any question or fight.I normally enjoy Belva Plain novels, but I would not recommend this one."
2,Not One of the Best,"I often look forward to Belva Plain¡s books with joy and expectations. Unfortunately, none of the recent read have met my expectations and this one is no exception. The story is too draggy, all three girls are so caught up in their own affairs, that the friendship between the girls are not reflected strongly, hence the eventual breakdown caused no emotions in the reader. I am simply unable to feel for all the characters in the book."
2,What a disappointment,"Wow...since I bought this book, I didn't want to waste my money, so I read it, and instead wasted my time. Very disappointing work from an author I have enjoyed reading in the past."
4,Looking Back,"An interesting story of 3 girls who went to College and graduated together. After graduation they remained in close contact with each other because they lived in the same area. Amanda married Norma's brother so that she could improve her social standing and rise above her poor, uneducated Southern roots. Cecile, the aristocrat, married well and remained in the same social circle as before. Norma, a smart but unattractive girl, finally married her soul mate after much waiting. The three remained friends until circumstances beyond their control caused them to react and defend themselves. A realistic love story with twists and turns of fate."
2,"Not her best, and depressing ending","I have read all of Belva Plain's books; I enjoy the story lines, the way they move along, and her stand for morals and clean dialogue. But this title just does not ""cut the mustard.""The first half or so of the book is interesting, with a fairly good plot, but the characters are shallow, and not well-developed. Several are intent on destroying their lives, as well as those around them.The ending is totally depressing with no redeeming value that I can think of; they all (main characters) end up screwing their lives in a miserable manner. This is an unusual twist for Belva Plain. Most of her stories have a good, if not happy ending. I was depressed at the end, and reluctant to pass my copy on to another of her fans.All in all, it was a disappointment and I do not recommend purchasing it. If you are a die-hard fan, wait until the paperback version comes out or borrow it from your local library."
1,What a disappointment!,I finished this book and wondered what the point was. I did not feel connected to any of the characters. They had no depth and were hard to care about. Many of the characters did things that were out of character and made no sense (ex: Peter accusing Cecile of talking about his project - not to mention her parents accusing her). I also felt that the story was slow & drawn out until the end and then years and years rushed by without really having any meaning other than to hurry up & end the book. It is as if the author got tired of the story too and just wanted it to be over!
1,Not Worth a Backward Glance,"What bothered me most about this book is that the characters' language and conversation never rang true. It is set in contemporary times (the young women would listen to CD's) but they all speak and act as if they are in the 1940's! The women seem so false as a result, that it is difficult to care about them. A great and grating disappointment."
1,"Poor plot, just wasted time of my life reading this....","My first Belva book and I HATED it. Should have followed my instincts and put it down right away, but I was hoping it would get better. What a waste of my life reading this terrible book with an even worse ending. TERRIBLE. Instead of passing this book on to friends or even donating it, I think it's going in the trash."
5,Friendship with a Twist,"This is the first book I read by Belva Plain and I really liked it. It's about three college graduates to keep in touch although who have very different life styles. It's a bit slow reading, but interesting to see how their lives develop. The ending caught me by surprise and made me want to read more of her books. I would recommend this book, but my husband didn't like it at all. Guess it's one you either love or hate."
5,Great bits,These bits cut through concrete with ease. A must have is you are a DIY or for professionals. Long life and does not rust up like cheaper bits.
4,Cardiologist and Poet Recommended.,"I got this CD as a gift for my 21st birthday and it is wonderful. It is delightful and dozy, complete with recommendation by Cardiologist and Poet, what more could a person ask for?!!Granted, some tracks almost put me to sleep...BABY NEEDS MORE!!!!"
5,Excellent product...,I gave this diaper bag as a gift for my nieces new baby..It's exactly what she needed..It's light and well designed and easy to tote along ...
4,Great bag,"This is a great diaper bag, it's interior is very wide so you could fit almost anything, and it has a lot of compartments were you can get all of your baby's stuff organized. It's washable and doesn't fade. The only disadvantage is that for everyday use is sometimes too big, but it's perfect for when you're planning to spend the day away from home."
3,great bag - bad zippers,"I love this bag with all it's pockets. However, the zippers suck! Almost immediately we began to have problems. You just can't stuff those pockets!"
4,valueram,"it is what it says, i bought and sent this product off to someone who seems very happy with it.so no complaints so-far."
5,Im 1gb happier,i received the package in a timely manner and when installed into my computer it definitely improved. I went to purchase another from the same company and realized they put up the price. I hate when that happens.
4,I wouldn't know,"Kingston usually makes great products, most notably their RAM. However, I purchased the wrong size RAM and it didn't fit into my Mac computer. Still, I'll give them 4 stars for rep alone."
1,Blue screen!,"I was really desperate for more speed on my PC. My processor speed is decent but I only ran 256 MB of RAM which is pathetic by today's standards hence the reason I decided to get this 1GB stick from Kingston.So here I am all excited about adding more memory to my machine. The stick fits in perfectly. I put on my machine and what do I see???? The dreaded blue screen which quickly disappears; then all the machine does is restart time and time again.I brought the RAM and my PC to my technician and he said that most likely the blue screen is because of a hardware malfunction, meaning the RAM was faulty. I was very disappointed seeing that there were so many satisfied customers who used this product. I guess I'm the odd one out. I plan to upgrade once more but next time I'll have to go with a company other that Kingston."
4,Does what its supposed to,"It does what its supposed to, only reason it's not a 5 is because of the packaging, blister packaging and in fault of amazon that packaging arrived in a 1.5 by 2 foot box for a product package thats about 6 by 4 by .5 inches big. Its unnecessary."
5,DDR 1 GB desktop memory by Kingston,Great response to the order. The Product works as it should.Arrived brand new condition.
4,Crank up the Ram,Needed to add memory to keep up with upgrades for digital photography programs. This memory has sped up these programs. Will eventually add more given the great price on Amazon.
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"What can I say? It's RAM. Ups the performance on your PC and the price was good. No fancy configuration needed, pop in slot, turn on machine."
1,Not Comfy at All,I have heard people talk about these flip-flops being comfy and since I norally wear flip flops all summer long- I thought I would love them for my Mexico vacation. They were not at all comfy and probably the least comfy pair I have. I would not recomend these rubber flip flops.
1,Incorrect Sizing,I love Havaianas but buyer beware that the sizing on Amazon is incorrect. The sizes are a size smaller than listed. For example the size 37/38 is NOT an American 7-8 but actually more like a 6. The true American 7-8 is going to be the Brazil 39 and the shoe itself is even labeled this way when it arrives. Amazon needs to correct the problem - I have to return mine because they do not fit.
5,Awesome movie,Gamera escapes from the rocket that was supposed to take him to Mars. Barugon and Gamera both look tight. No child cheering Gamera on through the whole movie. Gamera's scariest look of the Showa series. A great film for all ages. 10 stars out of 5
3,WOW!!!!!!! Surprisingly Good,"I rented this and was very impressed, as most people know the old Gamera movies are........in one word,horrible, this one isn't though.(NOTE:This is nothing like the chessy and horrible Gamera vs. Zigra, or Gamera vs. Guiron) This is a completly different series. Baraguon is awesome and quite a skilled fighter, this is no were near cheesy or corny to me. For a true Kaiju(giant monster)fan it is a must see."
3,Did You Say the War of the Monsters? Puh-leeze!,Yes two monster do fight twice but the battles have almost know action! Still Gamera battles a insta-freeze monster named Barugon. Gamera is in between good and bad although he is not fully the good guy until GAMERA VS. GAOS. Gamera is now equiped with his famous leg-jets(I think).
5,Excellent buy!,"Received the coffee table and end table last night, had them both assembled within an hour. Very easy, good tolerances (good fit), everything aligned perfectly. Very sturdy when assembled, good looking, nice style. Liked it so much we just ordered another one for the downstairs playroom. Excellent value."
3,Particle board table top,"Ordered this coffee table because of the good reviews I've read here. It arrived with a damaged top corner and a broken leg even though the packing box is in good condition. The table is not made of solid wood, both table top and bottom shelf are made of particle board (I can see it clearly from the damaged corner), I think it does not worth more than $50, would not order it had I known. But it's too much hassel to return it; called the number listed on the installation manual and wait for the replacement parts and got those 4 days later; I think that's a good service from Target. Comparing with many other furniture that I have put together, this one does not have very good fit accuracy among different parts. But it's an OK coffee table over all."
5,Used McCall's Cook Book,We have used the same cookbook for over 30 years and it was falling apart. I was so glad to have found the identical cookbook to replace our old one. We are very happy with the condition and look forward to using it for years and years.
1,"Cats Rule, but Tom's Bowls Don't","Lucky for you, this bowl is not available. It looked so cool in the photo. Frosty and translucent. The little legs would lift the kibbles up to my kitties fuzzy face saving him neckstrain at feeding time. Save your money instead. This thing arrived and besides having a crack on the bottom of one foot, it has this cheap plastic feel AND a gold plastic logo glued into a hole on the side that is in no way visible in the photo. That was the most offensive thing about it.Then there is the fact that it is on a par, qualitywise, with a gumball machine prize. A Dollar Store would be embarassed to sell this. If I could give it negative stars I would."
2,Mediocre,"Too complicated to use as a tutorial, and too simple to use as a reference. This book tries to be both and does a poor job of it. Buy this book if you absolutely have to (like I did, for a class at the U of MN); otherwise I'm sure there are other books out there that can do a better job.P.S. - I found at least one typo in chapter 1. Can you find it? :-)"
1,BURN,BURN IS WHAT THIS BOOK IS!! A RIP OFF I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES BUT THIS WAS NOTHING TO UNDERSTANDING BIPOLAR.NOT A BOOK TO GET IF YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONDITION AT ALL!!!
3,"good, but different","i really liked the begining of the book. however, then it went into all poem writing. i can understand it very easily but it was different. i have not finished the book yet. do i plan too?? not sure yet. but i can see myself alot in it, i feel like he is writing my life, just like many other books that i have read."
5,Simply perfect,"This small, single sprayer serial sprinkler was just the answer to my dilemma of how to water the 5 x 35 foot strip of grass in front of my home; oscillating sprinklers all oversprayed onto the sidewalk, and the ""soaker"" type hose sprayers were erratic. This little number is stable, precise, and easily attaches with PVC pipe segments to make a custom strip sprinkler. It was the answer to my lawn care prayers!"
4,Inteligent Politics,"Crass has always been able to maintain its status as the most intelligent a-political band yet. Their message is strong enough to convert even the most stubborn to believe other then what they were taught. This particular album has about the same quality of any crass album (terrible) if not worst, but considering the fact that they had no musical talent and mostly revoloved their practices around alcoholic consumption, they did pretty good. Besides, the message makes up for the low quality, and after a while, you really begin to enjoy the songs. I have found myself singing these songs everywhere I go. This album along with any other Crass album is an aquired taste, and not for the narrow minded."
5,The tools necessary to move to the next level.,"As speakers, trainers and consultants, we simply must keep up with the technology that helps propel our careers forward. Bill Ringle gives you the tools necessary to move to the next level and turbo chage your marketing and office. If you're serious about being a speaker, trainer or consultant, this book can help you immensely.Terry Brock, professional communicator, Orlando, Florida"
5,"soothing, peaceful background music. a favorite","I have had this CD for years and played it in the infusion room. It gives such a peaceful feeling. My favorite part is the wood-thrush singing. It has beautiful flute sounds, very dreamy, nothing startling or needing to have a volume change. It's hard to find good CD's to play that don't have one track that's too loud, or too much water running (to make everyone need to go to the bathroom!), or too many volume changes. Beautiful, dreamy; guitar and flute mostly, no recognizable tunes but I hum along with it now cause I've listened to it so many times."
3,Really not too bad.,"I watched this as part of the 50 movie mystery pack. The quality was pretty awfull, but the movie is from 1932, and you probably aren't going to get any better. Wontner is great as Holmes. The story is more or less based on the Sign of Four, but if you haven't read the original, you will have a tough time trying to figure out the beginning of the movie, since the story has been compressed to the point that it's almost impossible to figure out. Once things get going and the hissing sound can be ignored, it's pretty good, although not completly faithfull. Enjoyable as a whole. Get the 50 movie pack."
3,Sherlock Holmes,The Sign Of the Four was not the best of the Sherlock Holmes stories with Arthur Wonter. From the start of the movie you knew who the criminal was. Ian Hunter was not a very good Watson. And Johnathan Small was a Master of Disguise not a evil genius. But this was a pretty good film.
1,Chinese water torture,There is a background noise throughout the film that sounds like a convention of space aliens. It is loud enough to distract from the story. This is caused by a defect in the audio compression method used on DVDs. This method changes constant background hiss into warbling tones.The cover of the DVD claims that this version is closer to the original story than any other version. This is an outright lie. One example is the captain being killed while retrieving the treasure and not while visiting the major in England.
1,I hated it!,This book definitely wasn't what I thought it would be. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that wants to learn web publishing. The authors make a lot of fundamental mistakes. You'll find many inconsistencies and some outright false informaton.The books on CD are pathetic. With 4 books on the CD you would think one of them would be userful or at least up to date. You'll quickly discover these books are outdated and the only reason they are there is to get yuou to buy the next edition.
1,hardly worth the time of day!,"Why anyone would praise such a lackluster book is beyond me. The book lacks any redeeming qualities. Many of the chapters cover technologies that weren't even stabalized when the authors wrote about them.Even more horendous is the fact the authors don't really tell you these chapters are deal with topics that were in lala land at the time the book was written. As a result, you have bad rEALLY BAD information on many topics."
3,Watch,"Very nice watch. This was purchased as a wedding gift for my best man and brother at my wedding. We had some problems with it holding time and had to send it in, but it works now."
4,Recommended,"Excellent music all round. Top class piano from Jacky Terrasson as usual. A nice idea to have the two bass players together.I think there was an earlier version, now out of print, which was even better."
3,Jeffrey Osborne,This is a surprisingly pleasant cd. I would suggest purchasing it. If you have heard Jeffrey's voice you know he can seduce you with his melodies. Add this 'feel good' cd to your collection.
4,"Welcome back, JO!","It's a good album, with some highlights in ""till you come back to me"", ""for what it' worth"" and ""knocks me off my feet"". I don't like so much the arrangement of ""all at once""."
3,another one,If you like the 70's and 80's then you will like this Jeffery osborne cd he does cover just as well as anyone else nothing stands out but it is good for putting a smile on your face.
5,"Hate the Smell, But....","I hate the smell of talcum powder and find it foul. Even though I can't stand the smell, I have to admit that this soap is gentle on lingerie and keeps it looking fresh. If you hate the smell of talcum as I do, you might want to air your lingerie out on the terrace overnight to clear away the stench of talcum.Bad smell, but a price to pay to keep lingerie looking good. Since Forever New/Ovacion products don't have petroleum, you don't have to worry about damage to the fabric and elastic. The end result is worth it and you can always clear away the smell by letting your lingerie air dry."
4,The Only Way to Wash Delicates,"I use Ovacion to hand wash my expensive bras and panties, you know, the ones you never expect to last for more than a month. I used to put them in my washing machine on the delicate cycle and hang them to dry, but the bra cups would always lose their shape or get bent or wrinkled. Not ideal. I wasted so much money replacing bras and panties mere weeks after I'd purchased them.Ovacion fabric wash is a miracle in a bottle. You just fill a water basin, stir in two teaspoons, agitate the article of clothing and then let it soak for three minutes total, rinse it off, and let it air dry. The process could not be simpler, and my bras and panties are like new!The only thing I wish I'd known before purchasing is that Ovacion will only wash away dirt and sweat. It will not get out any tough stains. For that you'll needForever New Stain Remedy, which pretreats the stain before you hand wash it with Ovacion."
5,amazing product - better than woolite!,"I bought this after a lingerie store recommended it. They claimed it was good for spandex and other stretchy fabrics. I find it works great on all delicates - it's cut my dry cleaning bill way down!! When I used woolite, I found that sometimes my clothes that I hung dry were sometimes kind of ""crunchy"". This product keeps them as soft as if I had washed and dried them. No ironing needed either. I wash all of my sweaters, skirts, and knits in this. It does have a distinct smell - I like it but others have commented it's overpowering - the company makes ""variance"", a nonsmell version of this product, if you like unscented products."
3,Not that sturdy or strong.,"Perhaps the signs were made of thicker aluminum when the other reviewers made their reviews. The sign I got was made of very thin aluminum and it got all bent out of shape just taking it out of the plastic wrapping. I bought a plastic sign, from another seller, that was much sturdier than this one. It's a nice sign, but the metal is very thin and bends very easy."
5,d movie,i don't really watch movies dat often but my hubby luvs dis kind of entertainment so if he luv it i lv it
5,"Awesome, about time!","This was the greatest cartoon series ever, but it was hardly done justice as HD tv's were just coming out when it premiered. Now that LED HD is the standard, its great to have this series in high-quality DVD. It brings back great memories of me and my now 16 year old son watching the show. And my currently 9 year old is interested in it as well. Beast Wars was a childrens series that kept adults entertained as well with characters you could connect with and well thought out episodes. And now that you can view it the way it was meant to be seen, its even better. Maybe they will bring it back."
1,Transformers Beast Wars Seasons 2 & 3,"I am not penalizing this DVD set in any shape or form, because I am sure that it is good, but I already have it thanks to ordering the complete series from shoutfactory.com. So be warned, if you get this set only, you've wasted money by not buying the complete series which will have this in the box. That is all"
2,Bad in a Very Bad way,"I only finished the book to see if it was all a dream. In my opinion that was the only thing that could possibly save this book; if the main character woke up next to the super-gorgeous guy of her dreams and told him all about this dream she had been having.The book had a lot of potential to be better than it really was. Who doesn't love a scorn woman out for revenge? The father/daughter relationship could also have been a great storyline, but really, kidnapping him and taking him to a mill to talk?Maybe the author was just trying to see how far she could go before the publisher pulled the plug. She went too far, and not nearly far enough. I gave it two stars because I did finish it, but wouldn't recommend it to others."
3,Made me feel crazy..,for reading it! I did enjoy Janey's journey to discover what was bothering her with her dad and mom but I felt so crazy to still be reading it! I felt the characters really had some serious issues and shouldn't be on the streets! I think at times it was mundane and repetitous and I skimmed over some of the book. Def glad I checked it out of the library!
5,Fascinating and Literary,"Gripping, page-turning, insightful, funny. The writer has clearly matured since her impressive debut, both in the style and substance of her writing - more assured and more real. Too bad there's not more of an excerpt online - check it out in the bookstore (then come back and buy it on Amazon[.com], of course)."
3,Let the Buyer Beware,"I do not disagree on any level with the other reviewers of this CD. However, the content is recorded from piano rolls rather than directly from the artist. This fact is not explicitly presented on the web page. Yes, if one clicks on the CD cover photo to get an enlarged image, one can read ""First recording 1924 from rare piano rolls"" at the bottom in small type. Not everyone will do this however. For this reason alone I only rate this product 3 stars."
2,Not what I wanted!,"On this disc, Rhapsody in Blue is pretty much just a piano solo, which IS good, but I wanted something that starts with a clarinet and the other solos followed by the upswelling orchestra."
5,NOT AN AIR FILTER FOR YOUR AIR INTAKE!!!!!!,"The filter itself is top of the line. However I made the mistake of purchasing it for my air intake on my engine. THIS FILTER DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY INTO THE AIR INTAKE. It is for the filter that is under the glove box, and is used in accordance with your climate control blower motor to filter your cabin. I know it says Cabin Panel Filter in the title, but I was a confused consumer and assumed it was the panel filter for the air intake to the car engine. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!! Other than that, the filter was awesome."
3,Expected more for that price,"getting a zippo means getting a heavy duty lighter, but this one the peace on the front with the lightining on it poped out...."
5,Excellent overview of moral panic theory,"Goode and Ben Yehuda did an excellent job of taking Cohen's case study in Folk Devils and Moral Panics, and transforming it into a general resource for moral panic theory. The book is well organized and provides ample insight into the inner workings of the theory and is invaluable to anyone interested in how the media, the public, the criminal justice system, and the political system interact and influence each other. This book not only provides the basics on moral panic theory, but also provides good general examples of different moral panics throughout human history. While I had originally written off the theory, further research, including reading this book, has changed my mind. Anyone interested in this theory needs to read this and Cohen's work at a minimum."
3,"Overpriced, and I'm still debating what choice is best...","Getting the dust, and other particles off motherboards, electronics, and screens in the corners is a necessary and somewhat expensive part of life. Buying canned air is an expensive proposition, but don't dismiss it versus this. And if you go for this option, DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT get cheap and pick up some CO2 cartridges at a Wal-Mart. They wil short out and kill your electronics, and smear HORRIBLY iny screens.Think about how much you'll use and what kind of prices on canned air you can get, and think. You need the gun, and refills. Thats actually realistically like a 30 dollar buy with shipping on here. You can get canned air and never worry about ""equipment"" or clogs since you toss them out when they break or if they are empty. Not environmentally friendly, but then again, are CO2 cartridges really? The packaging is not recycled ;-)"
5,Have been using these for years,These are so much better than canned air for cleaning keyboards and computers. Hard to find locally now. Priced right also.
1,boring,"I don't know what I was expecting, but I found it boring. I got it because Wendy Crewson is in it. Not one of her better movies."
1,JUNK,Recieved it in a timly manner. Worked great for 2 days. Now the screen flickers and goes blank. This cable is JUNK. Don't waste your money
3,Rockabilly Fans & Led Zep Completists Only,"This is a tribute to 50's rock'n'roll/rockabilly reminiscent of Bill Wyman's ""Willie & the Poor Boys"" project in the '80's. Not much stands out here. The performances are competent, but certainly not exceptional. 3 stars at best."
4,Great Cables,"Great cables I used them with my Audio-Technica Turntable. Only problem I had was, they created a hum through the speakers when I use them in the phono jack of my pre-amp. If I use the line in jack, then they worked great."
1,not enough shielding,"I purchased this because I needed an extension to connect my subwoofer from pre-wired, in-wall cables. Unfortunately these extension cables are so poorly shielded, that it introduced buzzing/crackling noises into my subwoofer whenever they come within a few inches of the power cord. Proper shielding is like cable design 101, so it's surprising that these are so poorly designed. They're useless."
2,bloodet has no blood left,"if youve ever really listened to bloodlet's older material or ever seen them play live, then youll know that this album is crap. with both charlie(drums) and art(bass) both gone, its no wonder that the life is missing. face it: they just arent the same. this album was a good attempt at trying to maintain a unique chemistry, but its not good enough. bloodlet is one of those bands that were blessed with insane talent and genius. im just glad i got to see them and listen to them before this album came out. otherwise, id feel a distinct loss. instead i feel cheated. scott, who is an amazing lyricist, seems to overdo his approach and over-simplify his content. its almost as if he is trying to carry the evil-ness of bloodlet all on his own. this album feels like a complete 180 after the beauty of his predecessor. this album id listen to after i had no cd's left to listen to."
1,New bloodlet is not the old bloodlet,"Bloodlet used to be the most amazing band ever. Now they sound like a more metal creed. I am sorry they chose to ""dumb"" down there music. I really liked them."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,"I have been facinated with the subject of Polygamy for a few years and have read countless books and watched countless documentaries and reports on the subject. When I purchased this from Amazon I expected it to be similar to the other Primtime report that I had purchased; in depth and with some length. I was wrong. This is only a small report, about 10 minutes or so in length. It doesn't get into anything about the culture or the state of the investigations into the illegal activities there. It's simply showing the story of one woman who left a year before and is now living outside of the culture. But it doesn't elaborate on her life changes or even how her kids are doing. She confronts her father, but it's just weak overall reporting. I would not recommend this for the price. It's a huge waste of money!"
2,Rack is too large and unable to balance a turkey with a beer can inserted,"This is a very well made. but with the diameter of the top of the rack and a beer can, it is too large to fit into the cavity and balance the bird."
5,Great Stand,"This drunk chicken stand is easy to use and clean. I use it in the oven on top of a baking sheet with raises sides, and my chicken always comes out so juicy.I'm getting hungry just thinking about it, haha"
5,Great product!,This little gadget is the best invention ever. We are now hooked on beer can chicken. Love the fact that it's stainless -- will last forever and is easy clean up. Highly recommended!
5,Get it at Ace Hardware,Great product. The chicken I made was so juicy and was so easy. Get it at any Ace Hardware store. $ 5.99.
3,Beer can chicken,Bayou Classic 0880-PDQ Stainless-Steel Beercan ChickCAN RackHave used it and it works well. Chicken delicious!
1,Horrible Customer Service,The chocolate came to me melted and destroyed with no remorse from the company and little to no help in fixing the situation. I would not buy from this vendor again.
4,Stronger than Vita-Kombi 3,I use this on my face instead of Vita-Kombi 3 because it's stronger and it's worked out great. It also is more cost efficient to use this giant bottle.
5,Wonderful product,"The product I purchased was exactly what I was looking for, and recieved it very quickly. The shade was perfect actually beyond what I was expecting. I don't know what else to say about this Amazon product I purchased other then buyas many as you can."
3,Not quite what I was expecting...,Not quite as good as Enjoy Every Sandwich. I'll probablly listen to this every now & then...
4,Good product,"The hand grip would probably be a little more comfortable if it were a little narrower, but it is better than many."
2,Disappointing,"I hunted this book down for its chapter on Yukio Ninagawa's Japanese production of 'The Tempest,' and was disappointed. Horowitz is good on Strehler and Brook's productions, but he does not know Japanese and this is a setback. There are numerous mistakes in the Ninagawa chapter, and while he documents some of what happened in the performance, he comments very little on it. If you are interested in Ninagawa's Tempest, a better articles is Kishi Tetsuo's ""Japanese Shakespeare and English Reviewers"" in ""Shakespeare and the Japanese Stage,"" eds. Sasayama, Mulryne and Shewring, CUP 1998.Horowitz' appendices and bibliography are very useful, but overall the book is disappointing."
3,"I prefered Laura Kriska's ""Accidental Office Lady""","""The Accidental Office Lady"" is worlds more interesting, maybe because Kriska knows Japan better. Some info might be dated, but it's deeper. (Lots of judo there, too, as well as attempts to conform to Japanese society while still maintaining one's self-respect.)The travel bits were more interesting than her slavish attempts to keep up with her host mother's temperament. I found it strange that Muller would like to be friends with her host family after all the petty grief they gave her. Seems a little masochistic, and I had to wonder if she suffered from a sort of Stockholm Syndrome.The repeated error of ""Fugisawa"" instead of ""Fujisawa"" was annoying to read."
5,Not a bad book,"This book was good. I had to read it and write a 10 page paper on it so I started off reading the book with a pessimistic attitude. However, the book won me over as time went by and I enjoyed reading it. You won't regret it people, cheers!"
5,"Japan, as most foreigners will never experience","Japan has always fascinated me; its history, culture, cuisine, sights and sounds. For me, there is a familiarity, yet an ever-present mystique about the country. I had the opportunity to visit Japan twice, however, such short, touristy 2-week jaunts could never yield such a revelatory look into Japan, as author Karin Muller has provided in her travelogue, Japanland: A Year in Search of Wa. She writes with such candor and honesty, engaging in activities, meeting people, and experiencing things that most of us could only dream of. If you have even a remote interest in Japan, I highly recommend this book. Muller's engaging storytelling and enchanting writing style whisks you through her adventures in Japan like a speeding Shinkansen. A definite must-read for any Japanophile or anyone wishing to experience Japan vicariously."
5,A travel book with edge,"I will not forget reading this book. It is the very well written story of a young woman who spends a year in Japan. While her encounter with her hostess is hair-raising, it is also honest. Furthermore, we get an overall view of Japanese society--and its many, many parts!--that has the effect of making one realze how very complex this relatively small country actually is. Well worth the time."
5,What do you know about Japan?,"If you have never been to Japan, this book will intrigue you. Karin Miller does a great job of portraying Japan, she gives us so much more information than any other book or documentary."
4,A Minor Revelation,"Perhaps it was the remastering and the first time I'd heard any of the tracks with a good pair of cans tied to an amp, but even ""Relax"" sounded symphonic, ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me?"" was the ballad it was supposed to be, ""The Safety Dance"" made me laugh out loud, and by the end track I'd the urge to Wang Chung (tonight).This pairs well with the Kasem ""America's Top Ten Hits"" (dark orange cover) from the 1980s, but seeing ""Sussudio"" among the Kasem ""Rock's Greatest Hits"" tracks from the same decade is enough to make me pass on that disc..."
2,Not entirely pleased,"There were no seller details regarding this book apart from title and writer. I took a chance, bought it anyway and unknowingly bought a childrens book. I should have found out more about the publication before purchase, BUT really would expect at least just a few notes about the publication by the seller. I will avoid sellers who do not take the time to enter at least a few descriptive notes in the future."
1,worst,I did not care for this movie. It was the worst ever. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
1,WHY WHY WHY,"THIS MOVIES I'D NOT GOOD, THIS MOVIE IS WORSE THEN ONE OF THEM HOME MADE MOVIES MADE NEXT DOOR, IT WAS SO BAD I STOP WATCHING THE MOVIES TO GO TO ANOTHER MOVIES I HAD WISH I COULD HAVE TAKING THE MOVIES BACK NOT FOR THE MONEY, JUST GIVE IT BACK, I FELT SO UNHAPPY WITH MYSELF FOR BUYING THIS MONEY. YOU WIN SOME YOU LOSE SOME, I LOST."
1,The absolute worst movie I've ever seen!,This movie was worsem. Seriously I don't know why Robin Givens and Elise Neal even let their names be used in this. The acting was horrible...HORRIBLE!!! They had too many storylines going at once and they didn't flow well. Did I mention horrible acting?! I wish it could give no stars for this.
3,What's happening to the preachers today,This video is typical of today's clergy that will do anything to get the money they need to cover their sins. You can't do wrong and get by with it. What you do in the hose of God will eventually come forth and all stories will be told. It's not just the preaching but the life that you are living that you are suppose to be preaching about and setting the example for others to see. Corruption has come into our churches and we are satisfied but now is the time to become dissatisfied and stand up for what is right and not for what is wrong. Learn and know the word of God for yourself so that you can stnd up against the devil.
5,best crass cd,"crass is a great band and this is their best cd best songs are ""big hands"" ""darling"" ""the gassman cometh"" and ""crutch of society"""
5,Best wireless card,"If you're looking for a wireless card that maximizes on signal capture, you won't regret buying Cisco. I bought Linksys, although cheaper, it was a joke, kept cutting off connection all the time. Although Cisco is more expensive, you pay for what you get. It was painful to have to buy another card but I don't regret spending a single dime on this card."
1,Still waiting on my money back..,"The transaction- was great. The card was bad, I had to get a new harddrive-- took me 3 emails to get someone to respond. I sent it back and have yet to receive my money. Would never order from them again."
4,Handy little saw blade for tight areas,"I did not have the ""shaking"" problems that the other gentlemen mentioned. I would definitely recommend using a variable speed dremel tool for this blade. It is very handy to be able to vary the speed based on what type of wood you are cutting to keep the blade spinning at a safe speed that still cuts well and doesn't burn. I thought that this blade worked perfectly for me to get into a couple of tight spots where it was tough to use other tools. For the money, I don't think it can be beat!"
1,MD,"Based on information from its box, they just motivate for positive reviews promising additional year of warranty. Small golden ring and two digits were not glued to clock dial! Worst quality control you can imagine."
1,Very disappointed -- broke after four days!,"This watch is quite beautiful. But after only *four* days of wearing it, it stopped working. Just like that! I hadn't banged the thing or anything. Fortunately, I sent it back for a full refund. So disappointing!"
3,Disappointing Accuracy,"This watch is more beautiful than the pictures. But of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. My watch gains 20 seconds every 24 hours. Multiply that by 365 and you will see it gains 120 plus minutes per year. I was informed my the NY office that this is within the acceptable tolerance for this type of movement. So, if you are looking for accuracy, I suggest you stay away from a mechanical automatic movement."
1,Beautiful watch. Died after two months.,I got so many compliments on this watch that it broke my heart when it just crapped out on me without warning.
4,Spring Fish Art Glass Purse X138-1,"I keep fish, so I couldn't pass this glass piece up. It's well made and heavy. The colors are lovely and the little fishies are subtle, but sweet. I like to collect glass pieces and I'm glad I purchased this glass purse - it's very cute. It arrived very well packed and fully intact - no chips or broken pieces. I recommend this piece for glass collectors - it's really whimsical!"
2,hangover square,Incredibly badly proof read. The editor should be fired and never allowed near a manuscript again! I feel that I have been taken for a ride.Don Donovan
3,re-working or a draft,"See 'Twenty thousand streets under the sky' by the same author which in far better written dealing with same theme and story. Twenty thousand is highly recommended reading withs some unforgettable passages because they are so well written. For example a descriptions of a hangover-waking up the next morning in a dreaded and dreadful oops' state. Visually Hamilton writes like we are watching a movie AS well. (He wrote for the screen too elsewhere-Hitchhcock's Gaslight)Skip thisis book for the real thing.I don't know if it was a rough draft for '20,000 streets...' or filler to knock out another book for a publisher who'd taken pity on his lack of cash.Twenty thousand streets under the sky should be handed out with the Big Book at AA since it deals with the insidious nature of alcoholism with wickedly funny insight and poignant compassion."
5,A sound I have always longed to hear,"The first time i ever heard this was on a transitional interlude on radio around 4:00AM. It was a hair raising, chill provoking moment. I immediately attempted to identify and obtain this profoundly moving sound. It was NOT easy. I persevered, identified and located this CD after diligently scouring both the radio station (Pacific Radio, KPFK) and Amazon until I finally found the person responsible for airing it! Thank you Roy Tuckman/Roy of Hollywood for always giving us wonderous and rare offerings. This one is a beautiful and stirring blend of sound.Heartily recommend both the CD and Roy of Hollywood's excellent programing, week nights from 12:00AM to 5:00AM, [...]"
3,Rain of Blessings,"This CD is nowhere as wonderful as Hope for Enlightenment (also by Lama Gyurme) which I must have listened to at least 100 times over.One track has almost a jazzy beat to it, which I found annoying."
3,a good read ... but .....,"Sorry not to be ovely entusiastic about this one but it'd be hard for anyone to follow up Mother of Pearl. There's an over-all darkness to this work that takes away some of the fun of reading it. Before I got too far into it, I caught myself wondering why all the poor, uneducated people could articulate things so colorfully and poetically in their thoughts. Realizing that wasn't a very Southern attribute (Alabama native speaking) I let it go to literary device. The story is great and a couple and the characters are your best friends when you're finished. I hope the next work is just a tad more upbeat...."
1,Too Bad,"I was very disappointed in Melinda Haynes' second book. I started with great interest and enthusiasm, having found Mother of Pearl such a gem. The story has an interesting beginning, and I was intrigued by the characters- especially a young boy who is severly brain damaged and his brother. After a detailed introduction into this family, and all of its dynamics- the book suddenly shifts to fifteen years earlier. At this point the book looses all explaination. It becomes confusing and uninteresting. The characters lack depth- and there is a mystery that the reader should be interested in but isn't. I have been reading all summer and asking myself ""why"" with every page that I turn. I am looking at this novel as a short story- forgetting all but the first part of the book. Too bad to be so dissapointed after having been so thrilled by Mother of Pearl."
2,Chalktown should be erased,"Hmmm...I don't think these other reviewers are particularly judicious in throwing their stars around. I thought Mother of Pearl was a good book, but Chalktown was a weak follow-up. Some real sloppy moments of prose, not enough character development, and a rather ridiculous premise that Haynes was unable to make work."
4,Chalktown,This was a nice story and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The author is currently one of my favorites. She developes her charactors and story lines very well and I'm always anxious to pick the book up and see what's happening.
4,Great to see this band starting to do something big,"I've met these guys in Nashville (thier hometown, where i go to school) and they're good. I try to never miss them when they play here. This disc is highly enjoyable. Shows maturity from the Sle.EP, and the production is much better (which will really allow a band like this to shine). I also love the addition of ryan from Hopesfall. He adds alot, both musically and in the live performance. If you're into the dark 80's pop of Depche Mode or the Church, and the like, i think you'd really enjoy this album (not to say that its only an 80s rip off. they're definetly still rocking something new)."
4,its hard to find something this good,"This band is amazing in every way. The haunting melodies, the ""lovesick"" vocals, and the beautifully crafted music make this cd a must buy."
4,Golden Seallow,An older movie that still packs a punch. Wang Yu is fabulous. The sword play is grand and the special effects are realistic. I loved this movie.
3,Golden Swallow,"its not a bad movie, but there way to much talking then fightingone has to like kung fu movies to enjoy this film."
5,Bilingual bible,La mejor Biblia que e tenido asta la fecha. Te ayuda mucho a entender la palabra para cuando batallas con algunas palabras que no entiendes simple mente te vas a la kjv y te ayuda a entender mejor.
4,Great tool!,I have my own Bible King James Spanish version and I like it because it is easy to read and understandable. My grandson needed a new Bible and I decided to buy a Bilingual Bible so he can read Spanish too. He loves it. I consider King James Version a great tool!
5,Bible,This was a great book. It was easy to read. Each passage is right next to each other and doesn't skip around on the page.
4,Usefull,This is really helpfull cause even being bilingual I have problems with things that aren't in modern english. this way it helps me follow the minister
5,La mejor,"Ambas versiones en ingles y español, lo mejor para poder estudiar la Biblia y el idioma! Así podremos comprender y entablar sermones en ambos idiomas"
3,Bilingual Bible,"The bilingual Bible I recently purchased was not as advertised. In the Amazon catalog it was listed as having a leather cover. However, the Bible I received had an imitation leather paper cover. Other than that, the delivery was fast and accurate.Ray Page"
5,Bilingual - Spanish/English Bible,This is the Bible we will be giving to our ESL students this year. Highly recommended by an advanced student.
2,Same old same old,"This book lacks any new information on anger management. The book is way too technical for the average reader seeking good sound anger management help. The book lacks in feeling, but is strong on scientic babble. I wanted to learn about myself in the anger process not simply learn more babble about the emotion of anger. I wanted a book to coach me through the process of anger management and not simply ""learn"" about anger. The book does not deliver what the title says it can.A book suggestion for those looking for a practical way of looking inside the sould for anger management help is Stop Anger, Be Happy. It is simple, straight forward and guides you along as if you were being guided by a coach."
2,Justify the price over the 3rd Edition,"I just don't understand the pricing scheme here. The diff between the 3rd and 4th editions is over $50.00...are you kidding me? Now go on and tell me the 4th edition has within its golden covers newly discovered medieval sources..This book does not merit the price, I'm sorry.."
4,Fascinating,"This is an excellent and comprehensive collection of sources from the Middle Ages in Europe. Divided into thirds (a section each on the Early, High and Late middle ages), it has a solid representation of source materials on religious and political life. Its only shortcoming (and the reason why I could only give it 4 stars) is its lack of materials about (or by) women - given the attitudes, expectations and limited opportunities this is not surprising; still, I wish there was at least some attention given them."
4,Good white sneaker,I bought these to use as my chorus shoes when my instructions were to buy white Keds sneakers. I think the stretch fabric and the better arch support made them more comfortable for standing on risers for hours at a time than would be true for the plain fabric sneakers. Others who had the plain Keds were complaining.
2,not what I expected,These were not the shoes I expected. They looked like professional nursing shoes - with the no skid bottoms and the thick soles.
3,Comfortable,"The Grasshopper Stretch Plus White Leather Sneakers are very comfortable and have much more support than Keds. The toe on one of the shoes started to separate after about a month's wear. I glued it and it seems to be all right. Buying them on Amazon was cheaper than at a local shoe store. Although I am a medium or B width, I decided to get a wide and I haven't regretted it. After trying on a B width in the store, I thought they ran a little narrow and didn't want them to spread over the sole bed. I guess shoes of this type are really only designed to last a summer or two, but that's okay.After a summer's almost daily wear, the shoes fell apart. They stretched horribly and there was no support. The heel's plastic cup wore through after the first month. I think I'll go for something a little better constructed next summer."
5,So comfortable!,"Having wide feet and arthritis makes it difficult to find comfortable shoes - but these are amazing! I purchased them in white micro fiber stretch, extra wide - I can actually wear these for a day out running errands and forget I have them on! They are easy to clean with a damp cloth and a bit of Comet. When they were really dirty, I put them in a gentle cycle with cold water and set them in the sun to dry. I found that the laces were a bit too short to tie loosely (with swollen feet) so I purchased longer ones. Perfect!"
5,Liked what I received!,"I knew I wanted these. I tried them on at a box store. I was going to buy them at that store but I found these on Amazon listed as slightly used but in like new condition. For this item that meant that they were never worn, all the support cardboard was still inside, tags on, wrapped in tissue, and in original box. Paid 1/3 less than a rock bottom price with a coupon at the store."
4,For the girlfriend,"I am writing this review, though I am sure I probably shouldn't. I will say that I had never heard of this company until she told me about them and from what she says, I really wish they made men's shoes. She loves these for her job as a waitress. She works high end dining and these shoes are comfortable, attractive, easy to clean, and well priced.I say kudos Grasshoppers. You are doing great!"
5,Great muffins from here are made,I've been trying to find another one of these since it works so well. It works so much better than metal. The muffins always pop out and it cleans up well. The heavy ceramic seems to help the muffin cooking as well. I definitely recommend this.
3,good product,"Spray works easily especially for deck cleaning although I couldn't see much difference in the two speeds. I haven't used the soap option. It must be handled carefully since others have complained about it breaking.Also, it isn't really as strong as the jet select on my hose nozzle but the strong spray made for faster coverage."
2,broken,"I've used this product twice and it worked fine and did have surprisingly strong pressure, again as others have said it is not a power washer, BUT on the third attempt to use the nozzle exploded offthe gun....I have tried tightening as tight as possible, but the nozzlecontinues to explode off the gun. Basically it's a piece of junk and has to be thrown out unless Costco will take it back! I was going to email Bonaire but can't find a web site for them. Wonder why?"
4,Good but fragile,"For what it is I actually really like this thing. I use it to wash my car all the time and it's great for that. Unfortunately, it's a bit fragile because a lightly dropped it once and the plastic connector where the hose goes snapped right off under pressure. That being said, I'm buying another one to replace it right now."
4,VERY POORLY MADE. DO NOT BUY!,"I originally purchased this gun at Costco, and loved how it worked. However, after only using for 1 month, it broke. I returned it to Costco, but they no longer carried the item, so I started searching for it online. This one lasted only a month also. Last week, the trigger stopped working (the same as the first gun). Today, I unscrewed the soap dispenser to check the soal level, and the threads have totally disintegrated, so I cannot put the cap back on. Very poorly made. DO NOT BUY!"
1,wasted money,"Little better than a standard hose end nozzle... not worth the money. Soap dispensing only virtue but still does not clean as advertised.And hose connection broke later.Garbage product, zero rating"
1,Money wasted,"Got soaking wet after the first use, I thought it may be the hose, so I changed the hose and tried again, got soaked again! This is a poorly mad product with no redeeming features and no support/warranty. I now appreciate my basic hose nozzle a lot more. Don't waste your money."
5,¿Compared to What?,"Compared to: anything by Brazilian instrumentalistas, UAKTI,mix in a bit of Nana Vasconcelos,or Helcio Milito's wonderful CD: ""kilombo"" -this is music in a spirit related to: Argentine vocalista, Juana Molinaand faintly reminiscent of: The IncRedible StRing BaNd.If any of the forementioned artists have pleased your ears in the pastthis CD will also bring a broad smile to your face...Sweet, gentle, organic instrumentals from Brasil.*and... It's a double CD - double those 5 stars !"
4,made for skinny wrists,"if your wrist isn't extremely skinny, do not expect this bracelet to hang loosely on your wrist. it is a pretty bracelet, but, doesn't hang as loosely as i would have liked, it needs one more circle link, to really hang in a pretty, loose way..."
4,"""Victory Faust"" entertaining and disturbing","This book tells a deeply amusing and haunting story of fame, obsession and delusion -- on the part of Faust, the simple mascot who believed he was a ballplayer, and on that of the Giants, the team who egged him on for their own amusement and benefit.Schechter also gives us a richly detailed account of National League baseball in 1911. We see the players, the owners, and especially such reporters as Damon Runyon and Sid Mercer, as vividly as we see baseball's characters today."
4,"not bad, but.....","this cd isn't bad, makes a nice addition to a music collection already including some Crass. i would've liked other versions of some the songs....but hey!"
5,This is Crass's best album.,I really enjoy this album because it shows a lot of diversity in style. I listen to Best Before 84 almost every day and think this is the best Crass release to date. It is a must have for Crass fans and all fans of old school anarcho-punk.
4,very nice work,"IF you know anything about CRASS, and you don't own this yet, get it. It is the closest to a ""best of"" by CRASS that you'll ever get. The first track is yet another version of "" do they owe us a living"". That makes about 4 versions in all. The rest of the album is great. If you haven't heard ""Bloody Revolutions"" or ""Big a, Little A"", then you truly are missing out. True, there should be absolutely no reason for an anti-establishment/ record industry band of this caliber to release a ""best-of"" album. That is an undeniable fact. That aside, this is a really good ""best of"" album. If you appreciate Crass and their bitter attacks on establishmentary ideals, their simplistic music (of their earlier days, anyway), and their amazing way with rhyming and lyrics, then get this cd."
5,best before anything!!,This is a great recording a a must for any collector of early punk and anarchist's around the world. Can you dig it....
3,Buy stations or the feeding of the 5000 first!,"Its crass, either you love em or hate em.....i like the versions of these songs on their first LPs more, but it dosent dissapoint. Check title of this review."
5,Review:,"This cd has a great collage of sounds and music. The song ""Reality Asylum"" is a great example of the punk era. This is a must buy for lovers of old school punk."
2,disappointing considering the talent,"I was very disappointed with this CD. It's billed as having Stewart Copeland on drums, when in reality he only plays on two tracks. I was excited at the prospect of Stewart on drums and Duff McKagan from Guns 'N Roses on bass - what an amazing rhythm section that would be! But .....what a dud."
2,"Great Concept, poor delivery.","This was my first Graham Joyce experience, and because of this book, probably my last. I gave it two stars only because it was a very light and quick read so you don't have to waste hours on a book that leaves you quite unsatisfied. First of all, I thought it was a great concept, but the actual storyline seemed painfully unoriginal. My biggest gripe with the book was that Joyce spends about 95% of the book building up to a suspenseful climax and when he actually gets to the climactic scene, he takes about a page and then the book is over. You're left with the ""Did I just read all of that book for that ending?"" feeling. If you come across this book in your basement (not likely since its new) and you want a quick afternoon read, this is an ok choice, but it's not worth money and certainly not worth any high expectations."
3,A good effort,"Graham Joyce is a wildly uneven writer. Requiem and Tooth Fairy are excellent, some of the best recent dark fantasy. Indigo, on the other hand, is just plain awful and Stormwatcher manages to be only marginally better. Dark Sister, although not as strong as his best two novels, is certainly engaging and a good, suspenseful read. Darkside is not nearly as good as Dark Sister but manages to keep the reader's interest through the ending. Joyce's weaker points, however, are his endings and that's certainly the case here. After a good run the book entirely breaks down in a bunch of sound and fury which I found, unlike other readers, signified nothing. This is the Jerry Bruckheimer theory applied to writing -- when in doubt, blow everything up!"
1,Durability is less than expected,"For $3.6k I expect the interior parts to last. In Florida in a covered space the entire insides disintegrated in < 5 years......the flavor bars, the frame that holds the flavor bars, even the burners and ignition switches - all fell to rust dust....."
1,Peice of junk,I've owned this grill for 3 years under a covered roof and the entire insides are turning into nothing but ash. Rotisserie ignition and thermocouple are also toast. Called the company and they won't replace anything without you first getting an expensive repair tech on site to evaluate the bbq. This over priced bbq is a joke and so is the company that built it as far as I'm concerned. Would NEVER buy a DCS grill again.
5,don't just be a good dancer be a great dancer !!,after veiwing ken's first dvd I couldn't wait for this second dvd to come out and continue this great series in salsa dancing. The main reason I liked the first dvd was the simple and clear way the moves were explained and presented and broken down. I was very happy to see that this second dvd continues this exellent way of teaching and smoothly brings you up from begginner to intermediate level.another bonous in this dvd is the fantastic salsa music that can be played seperatly for practice.This dvd was worth every penny I spent for it and I'm all hope that this isn't the last one in this series.
5,Fun,"Just a fun CD. Great music, all the best from Skank, and it is better live. Partida de futebol is especially good live. If you like Brazilian rock and especially if you like Skank, this is a good one for your collection."
5,Easiest Turkey I Ever Made...,"My husband does the chicken all the time but I never tried the turkey. Wish I had found this years ago! would have saved hours of basting and worrying about dry turkey. It was so easy, 1) season turkey, 2) open beer, 3) drop in the beer, 4)plop on the turkey, 5) place in oven, 6)set timer, 7)go back to bed, 8)wake up, to golden brown, and by all responses from my guests, moist and tasty fowl. Steps 6, 7 and 8 optional. Yep, this is my new best friend for Thanksgiving and christmas. Giving some as gifts for my culinary challenged family members, you can't mess this up!"
2,Poor quality control,"This rack (like many others of its kind) is just bent wire that is welded together. When I received the first of these racks, one of the welds looked ""sketchy,"" and, sure enough, it was cracked. I sent it back to Amazon and am awaiting arrival of a new one. However, given the poor quality control demonstrated in the first one, even if the new one arrives intact, I'm skeptical about how long it will last once it's put into service. Not a good first impression!"
3,"Turkey, maybe","The product works great with turkeys if your oven is large enough to allow the bird to stand. It worked well in my gas oven because I could place the product in a open pan and place the pan on the very bottom of my oven. Add water to the pan and away you go.I my son's electric oven it wouldn't fit at all. Because the heating elements are at the bottom and the top of the oven, which doesn't allow space for the product. Be careful."
2,Too Large for Our Smoker,We have a typical standard size smoker (about the size of an outdoor gas grill) and this will not fit in it with a turkey setting on top of it. My husband has decided that it must take a special sized smoker because it will not work in our Weber Kettle grill either.
3,Ok Not Great - Use a V Rack & Pan Instead,"After I bought this product I found it cheaper at Bed Bath and Beyond . I believe they were selling for $7.99. I received a rack that was bent but still usable . After I tried to use it with my Big Green egg I found that the turkey and stand were too tall for my grill ...I guess that is called poor planning . I find that these vertical roasting stands never evaporate the fluid in the cans . I guess I would say then what's the point ? I believe you can receive similar results using a ""V"" rack and pan and adding fluid to the pan ."
4,beer can chicken holder,Have used this several times - makes wonderful chicken. Only wished it came with a drip pan - so bought some aluminum disposable pans. Bought a cookbook for beer can chicken and it has provided some excellent suggestions that were new to us - yummmmmm!
3,kick,this is funny it like a kid flim than action u can tell a lot of fakeness in it it gets dull some so if get make sure u get cheap.
3,TOO BLAND,"These were not terrible, but also not terribly good. If my junk food is going to be healthy, it still has to be tasty. I didn't get that from this product. Much too bland for me and my son. It took a long time for these to disappear."
4,"Beautiful, haunting music","Amanda Rogers album begins with an acapella number, and you are immediatly captivated by how her voice carries the song on its own. The rest of the album consists of quiet piano-accompanied songs that showcase Amanda's vocal talents and lyrics. Even those who are not fans of this musical genre will probably find themselves unable to stop listening. The only problem with the album are substandard production on a few tracks, and the similarity in sound of several songs. Great things are on the way for Amanda!"
5,Nice!,"I am using these for all four of the surround speakers in my home theater. Very nice sound, but a little on the expensive side when you are doing 7.1 surround. If they retailed a bit cheaper that would help, but if you want a awesome surround and money isn't a show stopped go get them..."
3,Well Written But Disappointing,"What an extremely well-written book. Ms. Park's expressions were captivating. My visualization of her descriptions were outstanding!However... I was EXTREMELY troubled by the last, let's say, 25 pages... I watched as Emily suffered through one bad relationship after another, then she finally found ""The One"" and you hear nothing else about her... Fast Forward to 18 years later... What??THEN... the end of the book had nothing to do at all about her struggle as a lesbian.. it became about her best friend. I don't get it...Sorry, but I could only give this book a three."
3,Clarification,"If the ENTIRE book wasn't about Emily's ""sexuality"" I wouldn't have been disappointed by the ending. Being a lesbian, I understand the fact that there are other aspects to a lesbian life. However, if those aspects were going to be introduced, I felt they should have been in the book all along and not just at the end."
1,"Disappointing Quality, Too Soft and Breaks When Sharpened","If you have been looking for the Revlon nail whitening pencil, do not buy the Sally Hansen version. It doesn't sharpen well; it breaks off every time I get it to a point sharp enough to work. Very frustrating. Unfortunately, it looks like Revlon has discontinued their version.But I do have good news: I took a chance and ordered the ""Flowery"" brand from Amazon, and it is harder material and easy to sharpen, works just like the Revlon and seems like it will last a long time.PS- I'm logged in under my husband's account! He does not whiten his nails. :-)"
1,Very Dissappointed,I like to buy several white pencils at a time. I am very disappointed in this product. No matter how carefully I sharpen the pencil it crumbles. I can't get it to sharpen into a point. I threw away three in a row after the first attempt to sharpen it. I tried hand sharpening and an electric sharpener and neither works.I will never buy this product again.
1,not a good product,"I received this item in good time but it wase defective.Every time I tried to sharpen the pencil it fell apart.""NOT GOOD"""
1,Useless because you can't sharpen it!,"I really liked this pencil for the first usage. It worked fantastic! Since then, however, I can't get a sharp edge. Every time I carefully sharpen it, the tip breaks off before I can even use it. Trying to get a dull tip all the way to the base of your nail is frustrating and pretty much impossible. I bought this pencil just a few days ago and it's almost gone already due to all the sharpening and breaking. I've even tried whittling it with a sharp knife and that also results in breakage.I'll be looking elsewhere, because I love the concept and the results...just not this particular brand."
3,DARK SHADOWS BLOOPERS AND TREASURES,"THE BLOOPERS OF THE DARK SHADOWS SOAP OPERA SERIES: It's an OK disc to collect if you are a big fan of the series, but if you are a general fan or take it or leave it fan don't bother. A lot of these bleeps were actually in the televised versions because it was live telecast in the 1960's to 1970's. Die-hard fans will love it. Good for the money if you just want to collect it for reference."
2,Not that amusing,"It was interesting for about 5 minutes. Some of the bloopers were actually kind of hard to spot unless you were REALLY paying attention. Others were more obvious but since the actors and actresses continued to act regardless of what happened, it just didn't seem that funny. It was interesting to see how they handled the mishaps. Not really worth the money to buy the DVD, though."
3,A bit of a rip-off,Most of these bloopers you can find on You Tube. Then there was other stuff just thrown in to fill the space.The guest appearances by Frid on What's My Line was funny though.
1,Glad I only rented it,"I got it on Netflix. It is a total waste of time.Had I paid for it, I'd have to kill now.Who calls slating a scene an outtake? Who calls flubbing a line, with no humor at all, a blooper?Add a few droll appearances on game shows, and other garbage."
3,Blast from the past,"For those who watched Dark Shadows when it was on TV, this is a fond memory. It shows how inexpensively things were done back then. Mishaps, forgotten lines, wobbly sets, etc. were quite entertaining."
1,Bottom Line - DON'T PURCHASE THIS BOOK,"I have been to Bolker's class at UMASS Boston and experienced the worst presentation of Java I have ever seen. The exact wording was, ""You will learn a lot of Java in very little time."" A promise never kept. You spend 20 hours a week not knowing what to do with HIS code for many reasons that I do not care to detail here. You never write code of your own making. You spend 5 of those hours writing a diary which isn't Java. The book itself is NOT an adequate reference for this language. In my opinion the man is due to retire. What I wanted to say is DON'T PURCHASE THIS BOOK to learn Java. Most if not all of the book is a presentation of a few small programs written in Java designed for classroom lectures. It is not a presentation of the Java Programming Language."
1,1/2 carat diamond studs,I have CZ's that are of better quality than these earrings. The seller should be full of shame for selling these earrings. I am ashamed of myself for buying them.
4,White Diamond Studs,"I know these earrings have gotten lots of bad reviews but I decided to try them out myself. I got them to replace one stud that I lost down the drain. I got the other earrings from Sears at a much higher price. When I got the replacement earrings I was very surprised and pleased! They looked much better than the Sears studs!!! Instead of replaceing the one lost stud I now wear the new pair!! They are much clearer, much brighter! And a much better price!! I love them!"
1,No brilliance,The set I received were very dull with no brilliance. They actually looked like they had been worn for years and never cleaned. I was very embarrassed to present these as a gift. I should have opened them before hand but did not. I would not recommend these to anyone. These stones should have been used for industrial purposes.
1,They don't even look real,We thought there was some kind of mistake when we opened the box- they're so cloudly/lacking in clarity that they don't even look like diamonds. Put the $99 you would have spent towards a good pair- I wish I had.
2,Not so good,"Although the clarity rating indicated that these would not be perfect, and of course the price indicated this as well, I was not prepared for the HUGE black specks in each of the diamonds. It resembled coarse cracked pepper, and was very visible even in small stones such as these. While the price was good for the size, I should have been more realistic in what to expect. I sent them back. I must say that Amazon was very easy to work with in regards to the return, and I was refunded my full purchase price very quickly. This experience in no way deterred me from making future purchases, and I continue to rave about Amazon's prices and delivery services."
4,Surprisingly nice,"I was very pleased with these earrings for the price. I had 1ct tw diamond studs that my husband bought for me several years ago and I lost one! I know he paid a lot more for those earrings than he paid for these, but at least I now have two diamond studs again."
2,What do you expect for $100?,"Carbon spotting, lack luster and shine, what do you expect for $100? The carbon spot was so large you can see it with the naked eye. If you have a girl that's impressed by the size of the diamond more then the quality, then go for it, otherwise, stay away..."
1,Get what you pay for>,"These were a lot tinier than I thought they would be. Also, they were so cloudy I had to return them. I've never seen diamonds that looked that bad."
1,Don't even look like diamonds,I just recieved these earrings today. When I oened the package i saw two foggy stones with lots of black spots. Most costume jewelry looks 10x's better that this. Do not buy if you're looking for earrings that resemble diamonds. You get what u pay for......
3,"14Kwhitegold, round, diamond stud earrings","The price was great. However, the clarity of the diamond was a little foggy - not clear - more yellow in color."
1,1/2 cttw Diamond Stud Earring,I was sorely disappointed with this product. The earrings were extremely cloudy and lacked the presentation that I expected.
2,:(,"Delivery expectation were good.. on time, no problems, and return was easy also. However, the product in itself was not of good quality."
4,Just Received,"It was given to the gift recipient today, as a christmas gift. I trust there will be no issues. I received ample good response when the earings were opened."
2,Depends on its purpose,"Received mine today hoping for perfection in the midst of bad reviews. The diamonds are not off color, decent shine, but one has a moderately large carbon inclusion and another small one and the other diamond has a small inclusion as well like many other posters describe. My gf is not a picky one and these are just to wear as ""knockarounds"" so there is no worry about her losing them. For $99 what more can you expect from diamonds of this size? This does not poorly reflect amazons jewelry collection as they are very clear about the clarity I2-3. DO YOUR RESEARCH before you buy and you will not be dissapointed or suprised."
5,Great Gift,"My girlfriend loved this gift, I would recommend it for anyone who wants inexpensive diamond jewelry."
1,"This is not a good buy. Treated diamonds, bottom of the barrel diamond clarity rating.","CZ's look much better than these unsightly stones. I looked at the reviews and did some homework on the diamonds. It turns out that I2-I3 are bottom of the barrell compared to flawless. Add to the fact that the disclosure of treatments,(laser drilling,coatings,baking,radiation, or doublets) and you can very well get a pair that looks even worse as you clean them in your sonic cleaner. I would not advise anyone who knows what to look for in a diamond these earings, or any other that has a warning statement of being treated to enhance clarity. Buyer beware. Buy the book, ""How to buy a diamond"" by Fred Crueller and never get ripped off by online sellers."
1,Black flecks inside diamond!,I ordered these as a gift. There were black flecks inside the diamond. Very visible without aid. At first I thought it was a mark. I would be embarassed to give anyone this so I returned it. I would rate it ZERO stars but there is no option for that.
1,Not fit for jewelry,These diamonds shouldn't be offered in this size for jewelry. The imperfections in them seriously hinder the sparkling characteristics a diamond is known for. Great price - but you get what you pay for.
1,I would give these 0 stars if I could,"These were the worst pair of earings I have ever seen. They were yellow from a mile away. Amazon was very accomodating when I returned them, but save yourself the hassle the price is too good to be true with these earings."
2,Confirm Metal Composition of Earring Backs Before Buying,"I always purchase 14K gold because my skin reacts to 10K gold or any other metals.I bought these earrings several months ago and was puzzled that I always seemed to get a rash on the back of my ears. The rash would clear when I stopped wearing them for a week so I began to be very diligent about regular cleaning, but it did not make a difference.I have finally concluded that although the posts are 14K gold, the backs are some other metal which is causing my skin to erupt. Now, I am looking for a reputable jewellery store that will sell me 14k gold earring backs alone.The earrings were delivered to Canada to day following my order and I could not have asked for better service on the delivery. They are beautiful and I love how they look - unfortunately, I can only wear them for several hours at a time."
2,"Not very sparkly, but they're inexpensive","These diamonds are cheap by both meanings of the word. They are pretty big, for the price, but don't expect anyone to be impressed by them. Either save your money or get smaller diamonds of higher quality. They are a light grayish color and full of very visible imperfections."
3,"okay quality, kinda cloudy.","I bought these for $99 a while back. i love them, although they are a little cloudy, and one is cloudier than the other (noticeably cloudier). but for the price i got them at, i cant really complain. i would not suggest buying them for any more than $150, simply because they are not worth it. and the diamonds are really not too great for the full price they are asking. I do wear these earrings a lot, and they are very durable, and they are a good size at 1/2 ct."
3,Lovely for the price diamond earrings,"I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift for my sister. These earrings had two reviews, one positive and one very negative. I was hesitant to make this purchase, but thought I could always return them if I didn't like them. I was thrilled when I saw them. They had a lot of sparkle. When I gave them to my sister, she was thrilled with them. The very negative review must have been from a jeweler with a loop. I felt the same way about these earrings as the person with the positive review did. If your budget is limited, take a chance."
4,Nice Casual Pair of Earrings,"Considering the price and the clarity, these diamonds were exactly what I expected. Although they are cloudy, I didn't find any black spots in mine as stated in some reviews. I wanted studs that I could wear daily and if I lost them, it would not affect me much. I had a pair of studs with flawless diamonds and I lost one -- which was devastating. I was hoping to purchase a casual pair and that's exactly what I got. You get what you pay for, I have no complaints."
3,Its small but cute,"the earrings are small but cute - i bought two for my daughters, the clarity isn't the greatest but its still not bad. I thought i would get a certificate of authenticity but i didn't."
2,not bad for price,"i was not disappointed and i wasn't impressed with this item. i won't return it, but i won't wear the earrings alone. they will remain in my second hole. these earrings are perfect for that. and if i get tired of them, i will give them to my 10 year old niece."
3,You get what you pay for,"The earrings came sooner than expected, which was great. The quality, however, was less than what I expected. When I showed them to my sister in the package she asked if they were champagne colored! But when I put them on they looked ok. You get what you pay for so I'm happy. I'll upgrade them later..."
1,Horrible,"Most items I purchase on Amazon, I have been very pleased with. Please save your time and money and pass these by, backings were loose and you would probably loose one moments after putting on, very poor clarity. All in all what could you expect for just $99.00."
1,Inferior product,These earrings were shipped in a cheap box and the product itself looks like a cheap imitation. I have never seen such a low quality item. I am deeply disappointed at Amazon for distributing products of this nature. Amazon should only sell books and DVD. No more jewelry purchase from this company.
2,Pictures of all the daimonds,"If you're asking Amazon to post pictures of each individual set of earrings, I think you are off your rocker. The description clearly states the color and clarity. I was going to buy these, but the color K is not in my scope of acceptance. I didn't have to order them to know they are yellow."
4,"Cites the sources, and goes to haggadah heaven","This haggadah serves the usual purposes of explaining both common customs and potentially obscure passages, and in giving tidbits of inspiration. More importantly, it gives the original sources for much of the haggadah, including the opinions which explain why certain phrases are added to the original source and dates on which certain parts were added, which for some reason is relatively rare in spite of the advantages in the next world which accrue to those who cite their sources.The haggadah includes essays by prominent figures of modern orthodoxy, such as the Rav, R Yosef Blau, Rav J David Bleich, etc., which are good, but in my opinion the main advantage of the haggadah is the careful citations of the original sources.In addition, the layout is attractive and easy to read even after a few glasses of wine. This haggadah is a classic, and I hope that it comes back into print."
1,"Wow, what a BORE!",I don't mean to sound harsh but I have to admit this video was a complete WASTE OF MY TIME & MONEY!BOTTOM LINE: ~~~~~BUYER BEWARE~~~~~~~
4,Good Product.,I ordered this DVD but quickly found out that I was still not limber enough to do some of the poses. Need more pilates before I cam move onto this one.
2,Eh.,"Maybe I didn't put enough effort into this, but I did not like it near as much as I like Tae Bo."
4,one dvd would do,"this is a good workout - i enjoy doing the yoga & the martial arts - and for that reason i'm glad i made the purchase. however, if one were to only buy one program; either the weight loss system (3dvd's) OR the budokan for beginners (1 dvd) rather than the deal offered for both packages (4 dvd's total), you would be just as well off. i discovered that the workouts are basically the same on all; the main difference is the number of reps & amount of explanation. otherwise as far as i'm concerned they're all the same. so if you were looking forward to learning different/more advanced yoga poses or martial arts moves as you progress, save your money."
3,Budokon weight loss system,"I loved the workout, it's a fun, simple and efective program, but both DVD's contain basically the same thing, if you want to buy the Budokon weight loss system I would recommend you get only the Budokon DVD, you'll get the same for less price."
3,An excellent map for climbers,"Aconcagua is one of the more accessible of the 7,000 metre peaks of the world. As such, it attracts a large number of trekkers as well as climbers each year. Some of them also die on the mountain in bad years.While most novice climbers will probably go with one of the recognised climbing companies from Mendoza, a map such as this is an essential requirement in understanding and planning a climb of Aconcagua.One of the basic rules of any relatively adventurous activity is to be sensibly self-sufficient, rather than being overly reliant on others. Obviously, climbing a 7000 metre peak is a team effort, but having a map is added insurance in an emergency."
1,Useless and vague,"Useless and vague.This is a total waste of time and money.Don't buy this map, it is useless, not well made, a crap.Instead buy the Aconcagua by Jim Ryan with much better maps and information in a still little format."
1,Aconcagua-A map-guide,"...The NASA photo from space should prove quite helpful in discerning a route. Not! The other maps, although providing more information than the space shot, do not justify the price charged. The general information provided is information any climber/trekker should know or can easily ascertain. There are no unique insights provided by this map-guide. The same information, as well as photos and detailed maps, can be found in other guides which are less expensive. The same info, as well as far greater detail on the routes, info regarding outfitters, etc. can be found in Aconcagua-A Climbing Guide, 2nd ed., which consists of 144 pages ..."
4,"Great Map, but don't buy it here.","Handy pocket size map, enough info to deal with when your head is hurting. But go buy it from www.omnimap.com, it only costs $5.95, why you daft buggers pay $15 is beyond me... there are more online map sellers than amazon, in fact all the maps I'm buying this year for my S. America jaunt are cheaper on [...].... go figure... maybe Bush has shares in amazon?"
1,"This is not a MAP, but a summary of all routs","This is not a MAP, but a route guide summary. The maps displayed are vague and surely don't qúalify as maps but far more as a skech of the different routes. I expected something similar to the mounaneering guide maps available anywhere in Europe for the Alps, with a scale of 15.000 or 25.000. I just hope I don't come of the route and have to rely on this document to find my way back..."
5,A real find,For anyone who has an interest in the history of Chennai (Madras) this book is a must buy. The hundreds of photographs both ancient and modern are well chosen and beautifully presented. The text is both intelligent and amusing.The whole book is well designed and made. The book is a delight to have while being educational and valuable to the historian and lay reader alike.
2,get another collection,i was a big fan of cher's torch songs on the sonny and cher hour. her voice was beautifully suited for period songs and it gave us a break from the novelty songs she was more popular for. i bought this collection at the same time i got BITTERSWEET COLLECTION and THE WAY OF LOVE COLLECTION just to fill all the gaps i may have missed. it was a mistake. most of the songs on this cd are on those other two. BITTERSWEET has some great songs bombastically produced. just too loud where they shouldnt be. THE WAY OF LOVE is much better as a whole. the few songs that are on BLUE and not those two are terrible live versions of hits by other people at that time. there may be one song i'm going to burn from BLUE and then sell it.
5,a must read,I haven't read it yet but i have it on good authority that it is very informative and its quite obviously true <3
3,"Should be in the ""fiction"" section","This book is responsible for misinforming a whole generation about what the female orgasm consists of and how to achieve it. In fact, most women know (and most doctors agree) that there's no such thing as the ""G"" spot; the female orgasm is far more diffuse and subtle. But I give the book a ""5"" anyway because, if you have a partner who thinks that the ""G"" spot exists, you both can have one heck of a lot of fun trying to find it!"
3,under rated,"I would have liked to see more pics of the grounds, the fountains and the statues. Just seeing the inside did nothing for me"
2,Very Weak!,"Unless you're a hardcore Missing Persons fan, don't waste your money or your time on this CD. The sound quality is terrible - it sounds like someone taped it using a single microphone, if that's board sound - they need a new board. The song selection is okay but the playing is very sloppy. Reminds of some garage bands I've heard in the past. This is one of those CD's you play once and say, Hmmmm - Interesting but never play it again. If you're looking to buy a Missing Persons CD - choose something else, make this one your last MP selection. With that being said, Terry Bozzio is still one the best drummers around but this offering just doesn't do anyone in the band justice (even Terry). As I said - Only for the very hardcore fan!"
2,DUBBED,"Contrary to what it now says for Product Description, this DVD is not in Swedish with English subtitles, it is dubbed. There are no options or extras. For a very good review go to DVD Verdict."
1,Esperaba algo mejor,"Duncan Dhu es un grupo que ha grabado varios discos - cuya calidad va desde lo mediocre hasta lo genial: especialmente desde ""Auobiografia"" en adelante... hasta que nos tropezamos con este disco, ansiadamente aguardado con paciencia que solo un fan de DD podria entender..y que me cuento entre ellos. Podrian entonces comprender como este disco me causo una tremenda desilusion ya que esperaba mejores temas... nunca me moleste por prestarle tanta atencion a las letras de sus canciones como a su musica... Los temas parecian mas ""formula repetida"" en lo que se trata de atmosfera, acordes y cambios. Vendi el disco despues de haber intentado que me guste y fracasado. Rescato dos temas ""Nunca me Enamoraria De Noche"" y ""Balada"" , quizas uno mas, pero ya es demasiado tarde: no lo pase a mi iTunes para la posteridad. Si les gusta el disco, esperen a que baje de precio en vez de pagar estos ridiculos precios de veinte dolares o mas por el."
4,Snapshots of the Last Days of the Last War,"This is a really interesting piece, in which the authors of the various stories in this anthology share their depictions of the last days of the Last War in a number of different lands in Khorvaire. Though it lacks some continuity with other works in general because it is a single edition, it provides the reader with a diversity of perspectives on the most cataclysmic and important event to affect the Dragon Between--the Day of Mourning. A good, quick read for any fans of fantasy."
4,Presto- perfecto,"Such an essential item for a cooker, no need to extoll any virtues here.Not sure if the price is right. Cooker costs $50 and the sealing ring is 20%, sounds like IBM, Oracle annual support contract."
4,Great but large,"Alright, first off I want to let you know that this is indeed a great bag. I have camped with in 8 degree weather and it kept me warm. I did not have a thermarest or anything underneath it, so it was my bag touching the cold ground. This bag is great if you are to be camping with your family at a park or if you and your friends are camping somewhere out in the woods. Ideally, I would not go backpacking with it. It's compression sack does not compress it enough, to give you an estimation...it's as if you rolled it up and that's it. It's not like other down sacks where it shrinks to the size of a volley ball. Anyway, great bag, I just wish it were a little smaller."
1,great,"Esta bolsa es grande pero totalmente abrigada y comoda. Es buena para acampar en todas las estaciones, en verano no haria falta ni siquiera la carpa."
3,1 Great song & several bad remixes,"The new re-mastered ""Oh My Goth!"" is a great song and a must have for djing. My main complaint about the song is the actual quality of the recording (I see this very problem on a lot of RIB releases), you get a lot of high end. I find it really noticeable on the dance floor and I am always having to be ready to tweak the sound levels when playing this song. Recording quality aside, if you are a goth/industrial dj you really can't be without this song! Its great for the dance floor and highly requested.The remixes I could have lived without, not one of the various remixes is worth any club play (unless your a house/techno dj maybe)."
2,great song but bad remixes,"This is the worse Razed in Black release. I was terribly disappointed. The original track, Oh My Goth!, is a good RiB song but, except the nu-break version and the master remix, all the remixes are unispired. If boring trance is your favorite music style, you will love this disc; but if you want a good R<i>B disc, just check out the Sacrificed album."
5,Awesome Bible Study,This is the best bible study I have done. I got so much out of the bible readings and the life applications. Would recommend this book to all high schoolers searching for the perfect bible study.
3,Just OK,"Got these for a pretty good deal, so not complaining too much. The first couple weeks they frayed so much I had handfuls of carpet falling out of mat. They also easily move on floor and don't stay down to well. If you don't touch them or use them, they look great."
3,"Looks OK, but very flimsy","I recently purchased these mats and I was dissappointed once I recieved them in the mail. They look alright, and will fill their aesthetic purpose, but as far as durability, these are not the mats you are looking for. They are quite flimsy and cheaply made. I don't see them lasting very long in my husbands truck. For the price I was definitely expecting more. My advice to you is to save your money...."
1,"No JET, this is a bycicle","5 stars to the JET I remember minus 4 to the recording = 1.It was taped in 1977 but sounds terrible comapared to recordings made more than 30 years earlier. Really sound does not exisist and the small amount that does is nearly always out of tune...I stop here.If you want Jet Harris stay away from this CD, buy ""The best of Jet Harris and Tony Meehan"" which by the way costs half.Ciao,Franco"
5,You asked for this...you asked for it!,"Swearing at Motorists are the quintessential rock band. They still live life on the road between gigs and they write good drums & guitar songs about relationships, life on the road , and getting high. This is probably their most rocking album to date. All songs are well-crafted storytelling that make you wanna shake your butt.They don't put on a half-bad live show, either."
4,good compilation,"This book is well organized, and gives a lot of pratical exercises very usefull for those who works with the frail erderly, but i didn't found anything new in it. On that matter,i was a litle bit disapointed"
4,A Refreshing and Imanginative Collection of Short Stories,"Lucius Shepard presents us with a wonderful collection of diverse short stories, featuring believable characters in exotic locales. The author's writing style is colorful and poetic,drawing the reader into the story. As is often true with the works of great authors, several of the stories leave their lurking remnants in the mind of the reader, for processing on a deeper level over time. If you are a fan of verse and fiction as well as short stories, you should not pass up this delightful box of chocolates !!"
2,Kill me...,"I saw a commercial for Atreyu's CD on TV and they looked awesome. The way the critics described them (a blend of emo and metal) was exactly what I was looking for. Good God was I let down.Out of the three aspects I listen for in music, two were actually very awesome. The crashing music and guitar riffs are excellent. The lyrics are dark and disturbing. But the singing...he doesn't know how to scream. He's growling with this low sound in his throat, and it's totally unneeded. When a blemish like that is that bad, it's hard to like the band.Atreyu has a ton of potential to kick [tail] as a band, in my opinion, if they just didn't scream so much (and learned how to scream well when they do). They sound so good when they're really singing, and as far as I'm concerned they should just sing through all of their songs. Try Slipknot instead."
2,Expected better,"A while ago, an acquaintance of mine told me of Atreyu and said they were awesome... so today I checked them out hoping for something good. Unfortunately, they arent very good. Seeing as how I have tons of experience with metal, hardcore, etc., these guys tread too far into the Nu-Metal ""genre"" for me. Honestly, what the hell image are they trying to make? I bet its an awful one."
3,It's Not Bad But It's Not Amazing,"This album definitely has a lot more hype than it deserves. Atreyu is an amazing band live...very loud, very energetic. That energy isn't remotely present on this album. Sure, no band will be able to capture the live performance feel on a recording but come on...even the vocals were a lot better in concert. The band isn't technically that amazing either. A lot of the songs are catchy but isn't anything you HAVEN'T heard a million times before. Also as a side note, those of you who listen to the first Atreyu EP, two songs from that EP are present here but those songs sound completely out of place with the rest of this cd. If the whole album sounded anything like the EP they released then I'd like them a lot more."
4,An excellent addition to anyone's metalcore collection,"After hearing about this band from a friend, I decided to go pick up a copy. Since it was only ten bucks and had the limited edition dvd with it, I bought it. Well I am glad I did because this cd is really much better than other bands out there in similar categories. The main vocals sound great for the most part as well as the drummer's singing which really adds to some of the songs. Even though there are a few tracks which I always skip, the other ones help make up for it. Although the metalcore/hardcore scene can get a little tiresome with bands really putting too much effort into their images or creating copycat music, Atreyu is able to make their own distinguishable sound which puts them apart from the rest."
3,Decent emo/pansy core album.,"This is a good enough CD. It's catchy, it's reasonably heavy, it's dark. If you really like Hardcore, though, stay away. It starts off surprisingly well. I love the first track, ""A Song For The Optimists."" It's got a really cool triplet part on the double bass pedal. The album dies out after the first track, though. It's like they wrote one great song, and then decided to play the most mainstream they could while still remaining heavy. And the guest vocals by the guy from Death By Stereo [is not good]. His voice is great in his music, but out of place here.So... download some of their songs, I guess. Or buy it if you've got a lot of money and nothing else to do with it."
5,This Cd by far owns.,"Well i bought Suicide notes and butterfly kisses,solely on the fact that lip gloss and black made me love them,so i bought the cd..and it was great,from 1-10 theres not a bad song..Deanna the Arsonist is one of my favorites,alog with Atleast i know im a sinner..those 2 rock the socks off anything..Well i strongly suggest you buy this cd,if you like hardcore,Thank you Joel Pelham"
2,Not Very Good.,"This was a recommendation from a friend. Atreyu is his favorite band. He let me hear a song or two and I didn't absolutely love it, but I didn't absolutely hate it, either. So I went out and bought this pice of crap. When I was reading the lyrics I noticed some explicit content throughout the album. I told my parents, and they made me get rid of it (they don't allow me to buy explicit stuff). I popped it into the player to see what I was missing out on before I sent the thing back. Wow. I wasn't very impressed. Sure, it had some nice guitar riffs here and there, but the ""singer"" was so harsh and pig-sounding that I couldn't even understand what he was saying. I wasted my money and was not satisfied with this album."
1,Get the curse insted...,"Suice notes and butterflies kisses is quite a dissapointing album. I didnt realy enjoy any song here and after seeing them live at the new england metal&hardcore fest it realy bored me...But, I do love the curse which is a much better album! It has better songs,production,lirycs & riffs while sn&ks had weak songs and boring riffs & meanless lirycs...For good atreyu get the curse but look past this album."
3,Interesting.,"i don't mean to down it with a 3 star--i reserve 4's and 5's for music i really like, and 1's and 2's for stuff that's really terrible.this is somewhere in the middle. like others have mentioned, the vocals are off putting...not really a death metal growl, but not clean either. strange sounding, as if the kid was just wanking around.but the guitar playing rescues it for me. in fact, if the vocals were better, i would rate this higher. not that the guitar playing is innovative, but its very ""catchy.""its hard to explain in a review, but you'll find yourself humming the guitar lines to some of these songs after you hear them. and all the finger tapping brings in some of the old school hard rock i used to like. in fact, the guitars are very 80's guitar god hero style on much of the cd.if only those darn vocals would improve.i would see if you could find full samples before you buy this one. i can't recommend it, but i can't say its horrible either. its just kind of in the middle."
1,OVER RATED!,I really don't understand what all the hype is with this band. They are mediocre at best.
2,Shallowcore,"Atreyu is VERY over-hyped. Very juvenile and generic lyrics, weak-sounding guitars, and very weak vocals. Just from the title ""A Vampire's Lament"" you can see they are targeting a certain group of teens. The guitars are perhaps overproduced, as they carry no weight or volume, no punch. My biggest gripe however is the vocals. Alex couldn't scream his way out of a paper bag. His vocals are seriously weak. Sounds like he has laryngitis or has strained his voice. The vocals just dont have the brutality that is required for this type of music. Listen to the punishing vocals from As I Lay Dying in comparison and it makes Alex seem that much worse. Even many hardcore Atreyu fans admit he's weak. There are so many better bands out there that deserve recognition, I can't recommend Atreyu to anyone looking for good metal or hardcore. The album is okay if you like watered-down hardcore or metal, but otherwise stay away."
3,"good idea, just poorly carried out","These guys have got the right idea. Mixing hardcore punk rock with metal. The only problem is they're not very good at doing it. The vocals kill this. All the vocalist needs to do is work on his singing and screaming abilities and they could be a really good band. You guys have a good idea in mind, just polish the sound up a little."
1,boooooooooooooooooooo!!! dr'don here to hlep.,Let me break it done for yous all this is by far the the most Boring garbage that i everd hard the riffs sucks and the Lead Vocals sucks this band has no talent at al thay just make the hardcore metalcore scene look like a jock.Let me help you pure kids get some caliban some Forever Is Forgotten or some eighteen visions and some Converge at lest thay have talent .This band should quit if thay no whats good for them dont wast the monay on this garbage.Plese do your selfs a faver and dont buy this or ther other cds. Because there all the same.For get this band.
3,Good Mainstream; Bad Hardcore,"I must start out by saying this album is nothing special whatsoever. It is a great mainstream effort, and I am content that music like this is being brought to the masses. When you compare it to Today Is The Day, Shai Hulud, etc.. it is nothing great. No tracks/moments stand out in my mind besides the catchiness of ""its so hard to see when your eyes are rolling in the back of your head"" and that is already wearing off. I do like the vocalist's voice, however at times it seems somewhat monotone and boring, yet it is fairly unique from what I've heard. If you haven't gotten into hardcore and you need something to get you into it, check this out. If you are already a hardcore/metalcore fan, your money is probably better spent elsewhere."
5,One of my best! 10 Stars!,"Okay, the first song I heard was ""Aint Love Grand"" and about 10 minutes within having heard it I was off the Tower. I got home with the work of art. I poped in the stero and......I was blown away with the work of guitars, lyrics, and emotion contained in it. This CD has got to be one, if not the best, CD I own. If there was one CD to take on a long trip this would be it. Crushing guitars, Emotional lyrics (Poetic at times) and just brutal sound! If you are new and want a good teaser song I suggest ""Lip Gloss and Black"". By far my favorite song. Stand out tracks : (they all good, but the ones I look forward to listening to are..) ""A Song For The Optimists"", Ain't Love Grand"", ""Deanne The Arsonist"" <--- CRAZY intro! Wow!, ""Lip Gloss and Black"". This whole CD is amazing! I will never stop liking this CD!"
4,Nu Metal?,"Unable to really understand how ANYONE could label these guys ""nu metal"", I am fully drawn into their sound and message. Having finally seen them live brought the bands power full circle. I am hooked. Best NEW metal band I have heard in a long time. True, at first the screaming throat of Alex seems a bit over done, but a few spins later and it all made sense. How can you appreciate the calm without the storm? Atreyu rocks, and I'm excited to see them blossom. Watch out for their Poison-shirt toting shredder on the left."
5,Positive children's story,A positve children's story for all nationalities but especially for African Americans!
4,Happy customer!,Very happy with item. Item was exactly as described. Received book in a very timely manner. Would definitely purchase from again.
2,Not a fan,I don't like Ameribags because they are too hard to store things in and find things in. I do not like their bag.
5,More to come!,"If you read the featured review in the May 2002 issue of Grammophone, you'll know that they raved over this recording and performance by MTT and the SF Symphony of the Mahler Sixth ... and with good reason. But even that rave doesn't come close to doing justice to this performance. If you've purchased the SFS' private label release of the hybrid-multichannel SACD recording, you'll discover immediately the audio jewels hidden away in this composition. It's a powerful piece powerfully rendered by the San Franciscans! You'll love it, and thankfully, it's just the first in a promised cycle of Mahler symphonies from MTT."
3,Not For The Beginning Napper,"Now don't get me wrong, Mahler's always good for a nap...but if it's a ""I need a good night's rest before my big interview tomorrow"" type of sleep you need, head over to Mahler's 9, or better yet, some John Rutter. But back to the disk at hand here. Once you get through the opening cacophony, you can expect to take a fairly restful nap for the first movement or three (and with the length of these movements, that should be a sufficient nap for most), but once the hammers and brass and all sorts of other whatzits get going in the fourth movement, all bets are off. The light sleeper will certainly be unable to continue their slumber through the final movement, and only the confident ""I worked 18 hours on my feet in a factory and my next shift starts in 4 hours"" sleeper will make it through the whole thing unroused.I have no idea what ""SACD"" means, but I was unable to stay ""SACkeD"" out through the closing bars.Robert Lewis"
4,Very cute little cabinet that does organize your business cards.,"Very cute :)Fairly inexpensive plastic construction, but it does what it needs to - hold and organize business cards and I've gotten lots of comments about how cute it is - better than a rolodex. Actually kind of find the clock handy too even though I'm surrounded by time displays at work.I wouldn't call it rugged but it works, slides nice, and fulfills it's purpose. I'm happy.I use the top drawer for paperclips."
3,its nice but it squeaks!,"i love using it, but once i open it, it lets out a squeaky sound that is irritating to the ears (remember when someone scratches the chalkboard?).now that is not just annoying to me, but when you are in an office where everything is nice and quiet and you suddenly need to pull out a business card, it is a bit embarassing to use."
4,"Fun, Quirky Desk Decoration","There's no quirkier solution for filing your business cards! I've had the Miniature File Cabinet on my desk for almost two years, and there hasn't been a single person to walk into my office and not commented on it. The mini size makes for a great ice breaker and conversation piece. How can a boss yell at you with such a cute business card holder present??The gray-color is realistic to a real filing cabinet. The Miniature File Cabinet is made of plastic, and I sometimes have difficulty sliding the drawers. Any normal sized business card will easily fit into the drawers, however there isn't a solution for storing all those unique card shapes (squares, circles, etc.). I have 500+ cards currently jammed into it, and sometimes have problems pulling cards from the back portions of the drawers. But this could easily be solved by throwing old contacts' cards out.All in all, I'd give the Miniature File Cabinet a thumbs up for being fun but still functional."
3,Just alright,"Cute idea, better than a standard rolodex and all my co-workers think it's cute. It just seems a bit flimsy, and the alphabetical divider cards in the drawers move around a lot, but that could also be due to the fact that I don't have it filled yet, I imagine they'd be more effective with a lot more cards in it. It's not the best product in the world, but if you're just looking for a functional novelty item I'd recommend it."
5,Normandy Breakout,A damn fine addition to my Osprey Campaign collection.I also purchased Lorraine 1944 by Osprey as both are collaborations by Zaloga and Bryan on the same theatre and compliment each other brilliantly.A must have for anyone wanting to know about the Normandy Campaigns of 1944.
4,O.K,"I was looking more for a devotional for my daughter and I.This book isnt really what I wanted,not to say that it is bad,just not what I was really looking for."
5,Glad I bought it,This a very nice keyboard for the money. It is big and heavy and seems to be high quality. Everything works perfectly and it looks great.
4,Satiek Eclipse 2: It is what it is.,"I've held this keyboard for about a year now. And yes they keys and everything works FAWLESSY. This is NOT a gaming keyboard so it does not have any stand-out features compare to a Razer Lycosa. This keyboard does come with 3 LEDs: Purple, Red, and Blue. I currently use blue but purple also seems pretty cool. I guess its safe to say the blue LED is by far more dimmer then the others. It has a pretty cool design, which was why I picked up this keyboard in the first place. Its basically just like any other keyboard except its more badass and has LEDs. The keys are pretty alright for me. (Was hoping for it to be rubberized as it looks like that from the pictures. LOL) I don't really have any cons for this keyboard. It is what it is. A keyboard with nice design and LED. Maybe $40 is kinda too much. $30 seems perfect. But if you are looking to get this keyboard, why not. Just so you know it is NOT a gaming keyboard. Again, it is exactly what it looks like to be."
3,Great backlit keyboard when it works.,"i had this keyboard for about 3 years before it bit the dust which i guess is pretty good, but at the same time i still have 10 year old keyboards laying around (I am a small-scale hoarder, lol) The lights are great if you work or play in the dark a lot, just make sure to keep it clean cause it shows dirt and grime fairly quickly. The number buttons crapped out on me which is the only reason I can't use it. But that is kind of a big deal, especially if you play games. I hesitate to rate this board only 3 stars because i did have a very irresponsible roommate at the time who i suspect of potentially spilling a mystery substance on it, which may have cause her early demise.Either way when it worked i really loved this keyboard and i'd still recommend it because the price is great for a backlit board. Wrist rest is removable too, thankfully. Dimmer switch is a nice addition, wish it had some macro keys."
3,saitek eclipse 2,"bought this in january and i love it but the esc button all of a sudden doesnt work anymore and its probably the most annoying thing ever and the ""quiet"" keys arent quiet at all"
1,pretty lights.... poor quality,"I purchased my keyboard about 2 months ago and am very disappointed. Only a few choice numbers on the upper row work... and I am discovering more that are faulty everyday... They worked fine when I bought it, and it has received no physical damage.. it stays at my desk in my keyboard drawer. I haven't moved it once... it makes no sense that they stopped working. I may have just gotten a lemon, but it will be my lesson learned that just because it looks cool doesn't mean its the best one out there."
1,Not helpful for vision problems,"I bought this item Saitek Eclipse II Backlit Keyboard to help me see the letters since I closely loosing my sight-- macular degeneration, this back lit board did not help as I was hoping it would for visually impaired folks the letters should be as large as possible and back lit. And the lighting around the edges of the individual keys should be eliminated. This peripheral light washes out the lid letters, then it would be an excellent keyboard for visually impaired folk."
2,"Fine, but high defect rate.","The Saitek Eclipse II is a fine keyboard... it has the traditional layout for the cursor keys, which is critical to me, and controllable backlighting with a bit of sidelighting. That's all good. The feel is a smidge mushy but works well for fast typing.But... they aren't manufactured reliably. The biggest problem is half the spacebar not working. To fix this, you have to disassemble the keyboard, readjust the rubber membrane under, reassemble and readjust the spacebar springs. Do an internet search on the words ""fix saitek eclipse"" to get a sense of how common this is. Fixing it takes about 10 minutes, not a killer but kind-of annoying. I've had this problem with all three Saitek Eclipse IIs I've had.My only other gripe is that there's no power key (for putting the computer to sleep) on the keyboard."
2,Lighted keys do not work very well,"Very nice touch feel and finish.. unfortunately, the lighted keys don't work that well and that was the main reason I bought it.There is a button to turn on the key lights and dim them, but on full or dimmed, unless you are learning over and looking directly down on the keys, it's actually harder to see them then if the lights are off. Surprising, coming from Saitek.The best keyboard so far for dim light viewing seems to be the old white or ivory keys with black type."
2,"Does not last, not worth the money","I liked this keyboard when I first got it despite some issues like the backlighting not being bright enough, but within a year serious problems started. The 'd' key doesn't always trigger. The 'e' key also won't trigger sometimes, and when it does it doubles up. Other keys are starting to have the same problem. I can't type three sentences without having to go back and correct problems because of faulty keys. Why can't anyone seem to make a keyboard that lasts more than a year or two of heavy use anymore? For a keyboard that retails at around fifty bucks I really expect it to last longer than a four dollar keyboard I can get at the local cheapo computer store. Considering I have a basic cheap keyboard at work that has performed flawlessly for four years this premium keyboard is a huge disappointment."
4,"Good KeyBoard, Not Really for Gaming","I am pleased with the keyboard on a whole. It is more or less a regular keyboard with backlighting. The backlighting is very nice. One issue is that when on purple there is one blue led that lights up which is annoying but whatever I guess. It has two different tilt levels which is pretty cool I spose. For $50 I can't complain to much, the keyboard works great, looks good, and appears somewhat durable. NO ISSUES WITH KEYS WEARING OFF YET! :D"
5,Great keyboard,"I had an Eclipse I at my old work and loved it. Strangely these days, the keyboards from the major brands almost seem designed to irritate their users. Crazy alignment of keys and poor tactile feedback are the primary culprits. The main reason I got the Eclipse was because it had a nice touch. Perhaps it's sentimental, but the touch reminds me somewhat of the Apple II keyboard, though a bit lighter. Combine the nice touch with the perfect layout, and the keyboard was a winner and served me well for a couple years. My only complaint was that it didn't have media control buttons, only volume.When I needed a keyboard for the new office, I decided to go with the Eclipse II. It was a gamble because I was afraid that they might have messed up something from the Eclipse I, but I wanted the media control buttons. Fortunately, now that I've used it for a couple weeks, I am perfectly happy with it. It has all the positive aspects of the Eclipse I, and more."
5,saitek keyboard eclipse two,"Love this keyboard. Feels great to type on. Fun to light up keyboard at night and not have to put on the overhead lights which heat up the room. We had a new ""mouse"" and just wanted a keyboard. This fit the bill."
5,Love this keyboard!!,"My son bought me this lighted keyboard for christmas. I am always on my computer in the dark. And have a hard time finding certain keys that I don't use much. With this keyboard, I have no problem at all. they light up really great! I no longer have to get up to turn on the lights when I can't find a certain key. They all light up for me now. I love this keyboard! I recommend it to anyone who likes to play on their computer in the dark, like I do."
5,Best Keyboard I've ever used,"I tried a cheaper illuminated keyboard from another company and AS ALWAYS I wasted my money. ARGGG! This Saitek is the real deal. It is heavy, well constructed and has three different light settings to suit your needs / tastes.I write quite a bit as a pastor and use the keyboard to type at night with out the need for overhead light in the room. You can call it ""green"" if you want to. I call it cool and soothing to think and write in the near dark using the glow of my keyboard.Also, I'm one of those old guys who plays FPS (UT2004). It is a very very good gamer board."
5,I love the Eclipse II,"I own the G-11 and the Firefly Borealis. The G-11 was huge, but I like the custom keys on the left side. The G-11 was not very bright in a dark room (IMO). I also have the Firefly keyboard on another PC, it is thin and low (no clips in the back to adjust the height) and the typing is smooth like a laptop. The Firefly has only 1 color (blue) but it is very bright (much brighter than the G-11) and the lights have an auto shutoff feature after 5 mins. of no activity.I love the Saitek Eclipse II because the colors are definitely brighter than the G-11, the brightness is adjustable, the sides light up, and the Eclipse II has 3 colors to chose from vs. 1 color (blue) for the G-11 and Firefly. I love how the Eclpise II has 2 height adjustments! If it had the auto shutoff feature it would be perfect but still deserves 5 stars!"
4,Saitek Eclipse II Keyboard,I love this keyboard and have had several friends order the same one. The lights are wonderful. Only problem I have had is two scews have fallen out of the underpanel and when I tried to put them back in they were stripped. Had to be that way when it came out of the box. So quality control person must have been on break when this one went through.
5,This is my second Saitek,"I ordered another Saitek Eclipse II to replace my previous one 6+ years old. This is a reliable, sturdy gaming and/or work keyboard. It has an adjustable angle, and lets you choose from blue, red, or purple back light with adjustable light intensity."
2,buffer sucks,"This keyboard is nice, if you don't mind the black paint wearing off and the fact that the thing jams when you press more than 3 keys at once. For instance if I want to move forward while turning in a drift at the same time I can't shoot, because it takes the up, left, ctrl, and space at the same time. My stock dell keyboard had no problems pulling this off until a coffee spill killed it. I do like the mute button, the color change option, and I can see it in the dark with the backlighting."
2,"Good keyboard, but...","Keyboard is pretty good, but when it arrived, the numpad enter key was broken and neither Amazon nor the seller were willing to replace the damaged merchandise, which I am very unsatisfied about."
4,Great Keyboard with One Minor Flaw,"I bought this keyboard over the weekend and think it's great. I had been struggling for awhile to try to type in the dark while my wife is sleeping, so I finally needed to invest in a lighted keyboard.This one feels great, and fits perfectly on my slide-out keyboard tray. The lighting is really effective and certainly makes it easy to type in the dark or under the light from the monitor.The only minor flaw I could find (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is the fact that while having 3 colors to choose from is really nice, the keyboard always reverts back to blue when the computer is rebooted. Unfortunately for me, I prefer the red color, which causes me to have to switch the color every time I boot up. I think it should have been easy for them to design the keyboard to ""remember"" which color setting you used last.Regardless of that, this is an excellent keyboard and I would highly recommend it."
2,I LIKED IT BUT.......,"I just got my eclipse II one month ago and the letters are wearing off. So far the E, A, N,S, U ARE WORN. When the letters wear off it is clear , so the black is wearing off. I thought they were lazer etched from underneath? Well this is horrible cause the light shines up through and you can not see the letter. I am the only one who uses the keyboard and do not abuse or over use it. strange, because it seems well built otherwise. The leg keeps falling off too. Personlly I would like the light to be stronger on high, but others may not care."
4,Great!,"So, they keyboard works great! it looks good and it's really comfortable too! The only downside that is bothering me, like the first Eclipse Saitek keyboard, the spacebar isn't fully lit. I didn't want to buy the third Eclipse because it was way to spaced out for what I wanted. Also something to mention, there is only three colors to chose from, Blue, Red and Purple. I have no idea why they chose purple as the final color, I'd imagen green would be a bigger hit.Other then that, they kayboard is great! Works fine!"
2,Had to send it back,After typing for eight hours my hands and wrists were very sore. The keys weren't confortable. It looks really cool and I loved the illumination but it was just not comfortable for heavy typing.
2,"keys failed, poor finish","Getting a good keyboard is not easy, the ones provided with computers are lucky to last 12 months in my office. I've had 2 of the Eclipse II's. On both the finish below the space bar wore off within 3-6 months and on the one I used the most two keys failed within 18 months. The back light is nice but not really bright enough for my taste.I have since replaced with a Unicomp Model M, which for $69 is tremendous value as it is a fabulous keyboard. It is an old school keyboard like IBM made until the mid 90's(check out the review on [...]. It is available in with a traditional loud clicking mechanism or a quieter version. Tactile feedback is positive and you always know when you have adequately struck a key. Made in USA."
5,lasts a long time,"I also give this keyboard 5 stars. There were some reviews at my time when I bought my Saitek that the letters would wear off - they didn't. The ""Atl"" and ""PrtScrn"" keys are reachable with the same hand - not many keyboards can say that. Not one malfunction, not one sticky key, the perfect fit for me!"
4,Just What I Wanted,I was looking for an illuminated keyboard as my home office setup requires that I often work in the dark. I have had the keyboard for about a month and am very satisfied with it.
4,Good feel.,"The best feature of this keyboard is not the lights, which are useful, its the feel. When I set it up, I immediately appreciated the feel of typing on a real keyboard as opposed to my laptop. When it gets dark out sometimes I'll flip on the lights just for the fun of it, but the keyboard has some keys that don't show well. That being said, the adjustable dimmer is a nice touch.From what I can tell, if you don't mind contacting Saitek, you can easily have new keys sent so it shouldn't be a major deterrent unless you are too lazy to call up Saitek (like I currently am).My suggestions to the developers would be to add a dimmer switch for volume instead of buttons, maybe add some programmable keys somewhere, and at risk of demanding too much- make it wireless/ bluetooth. I understand the power implications would require the keyboard to be charged more often, have batteries replaced often, or be able to dock... but it would be a nice option."
1,loved it-it died,"we love(d) this key board. not only are the lit keys cool and helpful, but the keyboard itself has a nice sturdy feel. I didn't know how badly we needed it until we got it!ammended review: the thing died after two months. okay, it kind of works, but some keys you have to strike several time to get them to work--it started with the U key and spread like a disease."
5,wow more amazing than i thought,this is the best keyboard ever my friends all want it they said its better then there expensive ones and the keys are so quite
3,Cool but not the best,Wife and I both go new keyboards she got this one I got another brand can't remember which. But this keyboard lost it's paint on WASD keys (we play World of Warcraft) before the year was up. Mine is still going strong no loss of anything. They keyboard still works great as long as you know where the keys are :)
4,All Your Base Are Belong To Us,"And now you can see it.Bought tons of these for my gaming center I used to own. Never a problem. Everyone loves them. Got one for myself and still love it. Only issue? The white on the lettering wears off eventually but low and behold, what's left in it's place? The same clear letter the lite shows through so just turn your LED on!"
2,"Okay Looking, Bad Spendy Keyboard","Let me start by saying I have two Eclipse I keyboards *office and home) and have put them through their paces. They keys feel as solid and tight as they did the dirst day. The lighting has held up well.I was super excited about the II coming out. Better media keys, color choices, a dimmer knob...Only thing is if you want a keyboard you don't have to type on the Eclipse II is the one to get. The keys are mushy and cheap feeling. The glossy black platic is a finger print magnate (which given fingers are all over it...). The media keys are cheaper feeling. The dimmer knob on mine was loose and felt very cheap. The backlighting itself... the red and purple were acceptable, but the blue was too dark and too dim to be of use. Given my rig has blue lighting, this was a sticking point.I would look at the first Eclispse or the Logitch well before goign witht he Eclipse II. It is not worth it for looks or performace."
5,Goodbye old friend...,"This was my first illuminated keyboard and it was fantastic. The spill light on the sides are great for ambiance, the different colors are great but at the end it ends up becoming perfect for a gamer or college student set-up. The bulky corners feel like it's made for a tank or UFO. A lot of fun but I've recently upgraded to the wireless illuminated keyboard by Logitech and felt that it was a natural change. It's more professional looking and the fact that it's wireless made it a no brainer for me. still, this keyboard is a perfect start."
3,sticky keys,"some keys are sticky and everytime youturn off computer and then turn it on at a later date, lighted color keys go back to default color."
3,Solid Keyboard,"Solid keyboard, but the merchant shipped it with mustard and other crap all over it. The keys were worn off and the space bar broke after a few months.Keyboard as a whole was great, however. The backlighting was ""meh,"" but it was well worth the price."
4,Still working after 1 year,"Working great over the last year under moderate gaming. Keys are still bright. Only issue is during the last month the E key can be a little difficult. Probably just need to spray it out good, I have a toddler that bangs on it looking for elmo videos that probably dropped a goldfish crumb under the key :)"
4,Saitek Eclipse 2,"Having a widescreen monitor, the lighting on the board is not quite as useful as I had hopedThe backlighting could be brighter, but that's a problem with almost any backlit board, they're never as bright as we want them to be, though this isn't a product flaw as it is our expectations are too highLighting is a little uneven, the numpad is noticeably dimmer than the letters and across the board you can tell some places are brighter than others, most noticably the arrow keys (the light is under the left arrow, the rest get progressively dimmer)The space key clicks if you don't press it gently or in the centerI've had no ghosting issues yetThe media keys are minimal and what I needed, though they require effort to actually pressThe blue setting is rather dimIt looks pretty and gets the job done, but little more than thatIt's hard to find a /good/ illuminated keyboard, but this one fills the need for lighting and function"
5,Best keyboard I've used in 28 years of computing...,"This keyboard is really special. I wanted a back-lit keyboard for my late evening computing and initially looked at the Logitech. After reading other reviews and comparing prices, I picked Saitek. I'm glad I did. This keyboard is the best one I've ever typed on. The ""feel"" of the keys is great. The back-lighting is fabulous. You can select blue, red, or magenta. There is a rheostat right on the keyboard to adjust the amount of illumination. The other feature I really like is the weight of this keyboard. It's substantial compared to other ""junk"" I've used over the years. It doesn't slide around. It has large rubber feet and a great rest for your palms if you choose to use it. Highly recommended!"
2,This KB is a P.O.S. Expected better from Saitek,"The only thing this KB has going for it is, it lights up.Even that is not great, the lighting is uneven and not nearly as bright as I would like it.This KB made for the gaming community, where Mountain Dew, Fat Tire Ale, Captain Morgan Private Stock Rum, Cheeto's, Pizza, and any other ungodly type of vice you can imagine are only inches away....DO NOT SPILL ANYTHING on this p.o.s. it is NOT made for a gamers environment, and if your careful and manage not to spill on it, FORGET ABOUT L.A.N. Parties, you can not guarantee safety in that social environment.My opinion, its an overpriced beer magnet, that can not withstand the environmental conditions for which it was marketed.Get something else."
3,Saitek Eclipse II Keyboard,Like the shape and look of keyboard. Like the key action and feel. Backlight needs to be brighter. In low light keys are difficult to read.
2,hard to push buttons,"Nice keyboard but one button had to be pushed on hard to make work right out of the box, now others are developing the problem. Very frustrating."
5,This is the heavy duty keyboard of your dreams,"I was in need of a keyboard and torn between the G series and this one, however, I settled on this one and I have not looked back. Though there are no programmable keys I love the color choices as do the others who use it for lighting.After having knee surgery I moved my computer downstairs and it is now in a darker area of the house. Since I play late into the night on mine between my monitor and the keyboard I have more than enough light to use it without worry.It has a perfect feel to me for my typing and it is so much quieter than anything I have ever used which I really say bless you for! Of course my granddaughter thinks it is kewl and the purple is more pinkish which suits her just fine. For me the red works for my war games and the blue is fine for other things, what can I say I like variety and I get it all with this keyboard.It was simple as plug and play on my XP system and has been a joy to have since my first plugging it in."
5,saitek eclipse 2,previously owned a saitek eclipse 1 and i liked it so much i decided to get a eclipse 2 and am very satisfied with it! i like how you can change the color with the press of a button. would recommend it to anyone even if your not a gamer.
2,spacebar gave out,[[ASIN:B000H6AY6M Saitek Eclipse II Keyboard (PK02AU)]I have bought two of these keyboards because I game alot and the spacebar wears out before a year is out. They are too expensive to try another......going to try another brand.
3,"Saitek Eclipse II is good, but could be better","I purchased the Saitek Eclipse II keyboard because I needed a keyboard that lights up. I am not real picky when it comes to how a keyboard fits/feels, I can usually hammer out words on just about anything.The keyboard is nice, albeit the spacebar is on the small side. The keystroke feel is good. But why I really wanted this keyboard is for the lighting. I wanted a keyboard that had strong lighting for the keys, as I usually type in areas where there is strong lighting from the monitor, but the keyboard sits in a dark area.While the lighting on this keyboard is nice, it is not bright enough. Instead of producing a keyboard that has 3 lighting choices (blue, red and purple), I wish they would have picked one color and made it brighter.Hope this review helps the next buyer!"
3,good quality,"Good quality keyboard and the lighted keyboard feature works just fine. However, with my old keyboard I had become used to using ""cut"", 'copy"" & ""paste"", ""internet"" and ""mail"" keys for expediency and had I realized this keyboard's keys are limited to the basic ones from 7 - 10 years ago I would likely not have purchased it."
4,almost perfect!,keyboard is great but i didn't realize that it wasn't wireless. the pictures appeared to be wireless but the details never specified if it was or wasn't. it would have been the perfect keyboard if it was!! LOL. plus the different choice of colors is a great feature!!
4,great but bulky,"The lights work great but the keys are larger then other key keyboards and will take some getting used too expically if your used to those really flat mac keyboards. Other then that it works fine, im using it right now even!"
4,Exactly what I wanted/ needed,"I was able to pick this keyboard up on cyber Monday so I saved a bunch of money on it, but even if i had paid the full price for it, I'd be happy with it. Pretty good quality keyboard. Full size, so the keys are not squished together like most of the other backlit keyboards. multi- funtions for music works great with itunes. Keys are affirmative, and solid. All 3 colors are cool and and so is dimmer feature. very happy with this purchase."
2,"Poor visability,but solid feel.","The light just doesnt come thru the keys enough.You cannot solve this by turning the light up.Not strong enough.I actually put lite colored tape on a couple of the keys I use frequently use while gaming so I can see them..The lite shining from between the keys does not help.The whole point of a lighted keyboard is visibilty.This has poor vis.Black paint is wearing off on the WASD.On the posistive side the board is heavy and well made.I am not a typist and am looking for at a ""keys you can see"" board now."
3,Adequate but not great,The lighting part of the keyboard is very cool. It funtions OK. The rest is just average. I'm going to upgrade to one with more features and give this to the kids who LOVE it.
3,OK until keys stick,It was fine until after about 6 months of use several keys started sticking... Annoying!
2,Letters Fade From Key Board ...,"While the changing colors are cool and it seems sturdy and far as data input ... so what is the BIG problem!?The paint or what ever it is is quickly fading from my keys ... when I bought this key board I thought the letters were etched under the keys so the light would shine though ... Nope!So far I can not read the R,T,I,O,P,A,S,G,H,K,L,C,B,N,M and the PERIOD.While this is not a huge problem with me since I know the QWERTY keyboard reasonable well ... it is a BIG problem for my six year old son who is trying to learn to type, so much so I am thinking of just putting back an old Dell keyboard.I would NOT have bought this key board if I had it to do again.The lights DO NOT make up for the fading letters."
1,Never Buy This Keyboard,"...unless you want to type on a keyboard with the key designations worn away. Over time, all of the used keys wear so that the letters cannot be read. Also it looks crummy when the keys wear. You cannot get replacement keys from the manufacturer either. I tried. Not only were replacement keys not available, the girl ""helping"" me was a snippy little b---h. The keys are backlit and the lighting is uneven from the start. The keyboard is okay, if you don't mind the keys looking bad after use."
5,This keyboard has been through a lot,"I've had this baby for 3 years, 3 years of heavy-duty gaming. I spilled coffee, tea and beer on it, mashed the ASDW keys and the spacebar to the pulp but they still work! Soft to type and very quiet. The 3-phase backlight was something revolutionary when it just came out, now just about everybody does it. The only reason why I'm retiring it now is I got myself a new gaming rig with programmable Saitek Cyborg keyboard and I love it too!"
5,A Quality Keyboard...And It Lights Up Too!,"Pros: Very sturdy construction that just feels solid. The keys also have a nice feel to them. Media controls come in handy. It lights up in three colors - red, blue, and a purple that looks more like pink to me. Matches my Antec 900 case nicely.Cons: Light could be brighter and is more of an aesthetic feature. Light is not uniform on all keys.Conclusion: If you need a new keyboard, I highly reccomend this one. If you want this keyboard to match a case or just because it looks cool, I still reccomend it. If you need to be able to type in the dark, then this keyboard will do the job. However, in most cases my monitor gives off enough light to illuminate the keys."
5,Perfect Keyboard,"This is the best keyboard I have ever had. Illuminated keys are a brilliant innovation. The feel of the keyboard is excellent, keys are very distinct to the touch, a lot less hitting the wrong key or hitting more than one at a time and they're very quiet. This keyboard even has 2 different sets of props for setting the keyboard at different angles. Installing the keyboard takes literally seconds; plug it in, windows recognizes it, everything works right away. Brilliant design."
5,great product,i love this keyboard. You can see the keyboard at night and i love the colors! It's very comfortable to type on!
1,If you want an expensive nightlight look no further.,"I've had this keyboard for 6 months and as of today the lights still work but that's it. All the keys are dead. I unplugged it, tried different usb ports, a different computer and restarted my computer hoping that I hadn't wasted my money. It still just lit up...taunting me. I guess on the bright side I got it on sale so I didn't get ripped off the entire amount."
5,"Great Colors, and Light Keys.","I debated on getting this keyboard for almost a year. I am very much a magpie when it comes to shiny things and pretty lights, but was concerned about how the keyboard itself would feel on my hands. I do a lot of typing for work, and have small hands.....so I have had stress-injuries from bad/ clunky keyboards in the past. I was very happy to discover that the saitek eclipse keyboard has very light key movement and has not caused any strain. I do find that I need the wrist-rest attachment because the keyboard is a little thicker/ higher then my previous keyboard.I love that it has three colors ( my favorite is the purple), and the lit keyboard really is nice to have at night when I do not want to have bright lights surrounding me."
4,Nice Keyboard,"Pretty cool keyboard, thought it was wireless, but it has a long enough cord to work for me. The illumination are cool, the keyboard has a nice feel to it. Pretty good for the price."
4,Great keyboard!,"I am a big fan of the Eclipse keyboards. I owned the first of the series and the new new Eclipse II does not dissapoint. I love that you can change the color of the backlight keys, and adjust the intensity. The keyboard is a weighted keyboard. It feels sturday and quiet. My only complaint is that the key presses are not quit as clean my original Eclipse keyboard, but still feels like a quality keyboard.highly reccomend!"
5,Saitek Eclipse II,"I was looking for an ergonomic backlit keyboard, but apparently those two traits don't exist. Therefore, I settled on this because it looked pretty nice. I enjoy the 3 different colors (kind of like a mood ring, the RED looks awesome). The price was great, and the attachable/detachable wrist rest comes in handy. It is adjustable, so you can bring it flush with the edge of the keyboard and not have a space in between - like so many of the pictures show.The one thing I DON'T like about it was that the media control buttons (play, pause, skip, volume up/down) do NOT light up. How rediculous is that?!?!? They are to the side of the intensity dial, but still it is hard to remember which button does which action."
3,Saitek Eclipse II,The keyboard is nothing special except for the lighting which is nicely done. The media volume control is small and a little hard to work quickly. It would be much better to exchange it with the knob for light control which I never use. My keyboard tends to add a space aft er the t key at times. Otherwise it was a good buy for the money.
4,Nice but keys lose paint quickly,"I've only had this keyboard for about a year and the ""A"", ""S"" and ""N"" keys have no paint left of them.I've never had a keyboard in which the letters on the keys wore off?!I like to change the colors, occasionally and the keys themselves are very smooth and easy to use."
1,Broken keys after a few months of light use,"Four of the keys stopped working after just a few months of light use. I had to switch back to my HP keyboard, which also has issues, but at least the keys work. I won't purchase this brand again."
5,"Still works great, even after lots of gaming","I bought this keyboard well over a year ago, and it's still going strong. I've done a lot of gaming on it, and it's also traveled around a bit (been dropped too). I have no problems with it, everything works just like new. And everyone loves the back lighting on it. It's always a hit at LAN parties :)"
5,One fine piece of hardware!,"This is one supremo keyboard. The visual is perfectly stunning eye-candy. The keys have a touch that makes you feel like you spent about $3000 for this keyboard. Saitek builds them right and forgets nothing when trying to satisfy all possible customers. There's a dimming knob, a light color, mute, and +&- vol. buttons. It is quite possibly the most comfortable and satisfying keyboard I have ever used. I realise this is priced with some of the higher-end keyboards but, if you are willing to fork out the money upfront you won't be dissapointed."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I really like this keyboard. But some major flaws have come up since receiving the keyboard not even 4 hours ago. The number keys have stopped working except for 5 and 6. Also, although the capslock is on, the light isn't on at all. I'm very disappointed and debating if i should exchange it for a new one... or just not buy one at all.As for the good in the keyboard, its comfortable, the glow is nice, very quiet.But overall, this is just terrible.... 1 star and nothing more for this DOA keyboard."
3,Good keyboard.. but NOT cordless.,"When looking for a new keyboard I specifically requested ""cordless"" .. and this was one of them. The reviews were mainly positive and nowhere did I state that this is a corded keyboard. I also searched via Google for other reviews specifically using ""Cordless Saitek keyboards"".. and this kept coming up with the Amazon listing. I am disappointed in that part of it.. and will test it for a day or two before deciding whether to return it."
4,Its ok but not great,My hubby got this for his self but he gave to me because he did not like we find it of of slick deal for $10 it go for $70 most place the only thing i hate about is the space broad the pin under it keep come off
5,More than I hoped for!,"I bought the Saitek Eclipse II Keyboard as an upgrade from a smaller illuminating keyboard. I really like the features on this. It's well laid out and very well built. It's got a nice weight and feel to it. The keys feel great while typing and actually have a little bit of texture to them. Even the characters on the keys have style. I especially like the glossy black finish to the main board part. The illumination isn't terribly bright, but it's enough to find the keys in the dark and make it look cool. The colors can be changed with the press of a button and the intensity of the light can also be adjusted. It doesn't come with directions, but everything is pretty easy to figure out. Great keyboard!"
4,Decent; better multifunction buttons = better,"So, this keyboard is great, but ideally the volume keys would be larger and not so readily confused with other nearby keys. Also, it would be absolutely great if the brightness knob would also function as a volume knob! Nice, quiet keystroke action, beautiful lit keys and a sleek robotic look are appropriate and appreciated. The weight of the keyboard is almost enough, but a tad more weight would aid in keeping it put in one location, especially on a messy desk!"
3,This is OK,"This keyboard is pretty good. The backlight is OK, but the keys don't get very bright, as most of the light ""leaks"" out from beneath the keys. Apart from that it's nice and solid... and heavy... so no shifting around whilst you type. It's definately NOT a Deck Legend keyboard, but it's a great deal for the $$."
4,A good book by Andre Norton and Sherwood Smith,"This is a somewhat Swashbuckling tale set on the fringes of the galaxy, and is another adventure of the Solar Queen and its crew. Overall the book is quite good, but the authors do not fully develop a good description of the setting for the readers. The orbiting Trade city, Exchange, is developed in pieces that never fully come together into a single picture. Some references are made to information from previous books, but the story line stands alone very well as a separate novel. The crew of the Solar Queen has some interesting adventures on Exchange, and acquire a very interesting new crew member. If you liked Andre Norton's previous books, you will definitely want to read this one."
4,again a good book by norton but....,"Since very childhood I enjoyed Andre Norton's books. Her have always been my favourites. Now I've read her lalest 2 novels - written together with other authors. And was disappointed when I saw that there has appeared a woman in the list of characters. There were no female characters in the previous novels of the Solar Queen series, and that was the reason it was so popular. She was really ahead of her time shaking the stereotype of these female cuties in every sf novel. A. Norton should have kept to this line when writing her new novels. Thanks God there are no bed scenes in them! And thanks God again that this god-knows-what Rael marries yhe old captain at last, and not one of the young characters."
3,The first half of this book is powerful. Buy it for this reason!,"Feinberg deserves praise for bringing forth the troubling emphasis that current curriculums intended for the adolescent age, have placed on the ""problem novel"". Yet she is not dogmatic enough in her important argument. Instead we are led off track in the 2nd half of the book on a self absorbed meandering with no clear cut themes... that ends up focusing on her daughter's need for several surgeries relating to ear infections. How did we get here?! To presume a connection between the 2 parts of this book, one would need to do as the subtitle suggests and truly ""make things up"". Nonetheless, the assertions in the 1rst half, as well as the footnotes, make those parts of the book quite a compelling read. Its worth the price of the book for the sake of those first arguments. Then save yourself time and confusion by skimming or avoiding entirely, the author's self indulgent off-topic stuff in the 2nd half."
4,compelling simplicity,"The story is told with litle embellishment. At first the writing seems too straightforward, but as the story progresses you are drawn into the lives and ideas of the characters. The story seems to accurately portray life in our internment camps, and how it affected everyone. It gave me pause about the changing climate of our country, and to consider how I would react in similar circumstances. Ms. Meuller does not allow us simply answers to the questions she raises. And importantly, in the end - as with any great story - I wanted to know how the characters' lives continued."
1,I am not satisfied with the seller,"the blender did not seem new, their sound is strange since the week I hurt, unfortunately I can not return it by the purchase from Venezuela. seemed a rebuilt machine. Kitchen Aid is an excellent brand mixers I have 4 of this brand and first brought this problem. I think it was because the seller was not the original box"
5,NICE!,"This sucker mixes. I use it every day. Mix, Mix, Mix. Mixing is what I do. Nice mixer. I mix stuff with my new mixer."
3,KitchenAid Pro 600 Purchase,"This mixer is very noisy. I purchased another KitchenAid mixer last year (also a Pro 600) that was much less noisy. I was hoping that was indicative of a change that had been made, but unless this new one is an older model, that apparently is not the case. Disappointing! Otherwise, good machine."
1,obfuscation at its finest,"I found this book to be quite disappointing. Soros talks about his financial investments with extremely dense prose, using some words I think are made up, and thoroughly unenlightening. He relates his ""experiments"", but they are not real ones in the sense of controlled scientific experiments. graphics annotations are unhelpful, tables of trades unenlightening.As successful as he was/is, I was excited to get this book, but cannot recommend it at all."
2,Unreal!!,I ordered the wrong product and I requested that the order be cancelled. I submitted my request on a Friday. I did not get a response until Monday afternoon. My request was made before the ship date but seller would not cancel. Now I have to go through the trouble of returning it.Poor communication!!!
2,Pseudo-intellectual,"It's not enough for Soros to be a billionaire, he also wants to be thought of as a scholar. His ""theory"" of reflexivity isn't at all developed; no system, no analysis, nothing but recurring promises to address the problems attendant to developing such a theory, without ever doing so. The basic premise, that markets are self-referential and are influenced by the psychology of market players, is pretty standard now and there are a number of academic circles which are truly analyzing it in-depth and truly developing theories.But then these academics never have and never will make a killing in the market, will they? Exactly right, and Soros is more interesting in his simple war stories than in his feeble attempts at philosophizing, because he is essentially a man of action, not a coherent thinker. He relies, successfully, as much on instinct as on anything else. Why he should be ashamed of this is beyond me."
3,"Absolutely money maker, but hard to read!","If you are such a hunger about how to make money from investment & ready to suffer by reading this book to catch its essence, then this book is a must. But for a beginner & common people, I suggest never touch this book! You'll get a headache & frustrated feelings. Still want to try?.. then make your own day .."
1,Very tough to get through,"I rate this book as a two because it is hard to find the insight put forth. If you can follow Mr. Soros's writing, you are a better person than I am. The fact that the book is written like a diary does nothing to make it easier to read. Aside from a few short economic lessons, I found the book to be way over my head, and I do not consider myself an amateur investor. Unless you are looking to trade currency swaps and futures, I would recommend that you avoid this book. George Soros is an ivesting legend, but this is more like a philosophy textbook than anything else"
3,Better finance books,"Many people, including myself, bought this book because it's authored by none author than George Soros. Were there many takeaways that I could apply to my own investing? Not really. An interesting read, but it shouldn't be at the top of your list of investing book queue."
4,Harder to comprehend that I've hoped for,"The book was written in a way that it's not too friendly when you're not in the finance major. The language is hard. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who doesn't have a pretty good knowledge of the financial market and also already knowing many of the financial terms that are used. In addition, there are many vocabulary that I had to look up in the dictionary to know what they mean. Sorry, perhaps, I better improve my English level as well."
3,Is 3 stars too generous?,"I really liked the concept of this book - it started out great -but the execution was terrible. For one: The main character is not only silly, she's obtuse and annoying. I wanted to slap her many times throughout the book. Her scheming plan (based on a plot from a romance novel of all things) to win over James was pretty pathetic to say the least. If I were him, I wouldn't want a girl like her.This book could have been a winner but it was mostly a dud. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy try ANIMAL ATTRACTION by Jamie Ponti. That is awesome!"
3,"Good book, but a little outdated!","I really enjoyed this book, but Amateur Radio has changed lots since 2001!Biggest change? The FCC does not require morse code at all, for any license class, not even Amateur Extra Class! More priviledges have also been granted to lower class licensees, neither of which are covered in the 2001 edition I purchased!Still a great book if you can get it at a good price!"
3,A must?,A must? for beginners. Very easy to read. I'll recomend this book only if you have extra time. You can die without reading it.
1,This version is ANCIENT,Lonely Planet does a good job but this is the 2002 edition. go for the new edition
5,A must to read book by students in higher studies,This book sets up the frame of the student's knowledge about research methods in applied linguistics. It is a very essential textbook for students who wish to learn about carrying out an MA thesis or a mini-research paper.
3,OK. feels cheep to me. wobbles,I have installed 10-15 fans in my life. I have never had a fan wobble brand new like this one. I never used a balancing kit before and I will have to for this when i find the time.the globe is anoying to get straight as it had no absolute seated position. The light is only bright directly below. its very direct light which is the opposite of what I was looking for. Figured I would be safe with a big white diffuser like this has.The overall look is ok. There are big clownshoe chains that hang not shown in picture. I wish these were removable as I dont plan to control it that way.
3,Not a lot of air movement,"We bought two of these fans, and they look great and run pretty quietly. I also found them easy to install vs. many others I've installed over the years from various manufacturers. They just don't move a lot of air, so you might want to look elsewhere."
3,Pretty & low profile; but not steady,"Replaced a diff fan with this one, to get black instead of brown. Love the low profile. However, even though it moves very quickly, it doesn't seem as productive at cooling as our last fan. It also wobbles A LOT. Maybe we didn't put it in properly, but the other 9 fans we've put in our house don't do this."
2,Doesnt put out enough air!,"I bought this fan and thought I was getting a fairly high quality fan. But this fan doesn't put out any air flow, even on the highest speed! I can't believe how sub par this fan is. Do not buy this fan."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"I thought I had hit a home run after looking for a sleek good looking fan and found this one. I bought FOUR and had them installed. I've had lots of fans over the past 20 years (living in Texas we need them) and these are by far the worst. Even on high, they barely put out any air. I thought maybe I had one defective unit, but ALL FOUR are the same. These fans do anything BUT put out air! BEWARE!"
4,Good fan,"Fast delivery. Easy installation. However, it only holds two 40 watt candelabra bulbs. Does not emitt a lot of light. Wish it would hold four lights, good fan for mood lighting, but not enough for reading in an average sized room."
3,Wouldn't recommend,"I'm in the third house I've owned, and I've installed many ceiling fans. Getting them installed is always a challenge for one reason or another, and this one was no exception, though I encountered problems I've not had before. The blade mounting brackets were different than what was pictured in the installation booklet - they were flat with holes for the bolts to protrude but no threads to attach them. The provided bolts were about 1/4"" long and did not protrude past the fan blades. The install booklet mentioned nuts, but none were provided. So, needed to make an impromptu trip to the hardware store to purchase nuts and bolts that would actually work (10-24 1/2 inch, for those of you who want your hardware shopping to be less impromptu). The fan's quality in general seemed cheap; I'm hoping that I get a few years of service out of it, but I have my doubts. It is very sharp looking, though, once I finally got it installed. It's no louder than any other fan in my house."
2,Great product- louzy company.,"I bought these pants from Galaxy Army Navy through Amazon. Then I purchased the pants in a different size directly fromt the company's website. I needed to return two pants. The ones I purchased through Amazon I got my refund, but the company never refunded my other pair. I will not buy anything from Galaxy Army Navy again."
5,Never read the books but purchasing TODAY!,"Last night I had the opportunity to view a play entitled ""The Boxcar Children"" at the Seattle Children's Theatre. What a masterpiece--""flawless"" expressed my husband who accompanied me along with our 4 year old daughter and 6 year old son. It captured the attention of old and young alike; not to mention, a tear jerker. I'm so anxious to purchase the books! I've read the reviews from others and can't wait to dive into them to read to my little ones! I have to say, the best part of the evening was actually meeting Gertrude Chandler Warner at the reception--what a wonderful treat!!!!! I placed 5 stars on the rating even though I have not read them yet...as they say, the book is always better!!!"
4,GEM IS TRULY OUTRAGEOUS!,I got this for my wife who used to watch it as a kid....I have to say I enjoy watching it with her. :-)
3,It's okay,the first disc would skip in parts almost to the point of expecting it every episode. I didn't want an exchange for it because my favorite episodes as a kid were on the other three discs. Which played fine.
3,"Review of ""Your English Ancestry""","When I ordered this book, I expected this book to include information and advice specifically for North Americans. Despite the fact that it is very informative and packed with helpful notes on records to search including one chapter on ""Early (pre 1700) England research"", I was in for a disappointment since it was mostly information for the general researcher. I guess I expected more on sources a North American could use for England research. Unfortunately, that was not the case over all. Due to this limitation, I believe a more suitable title would have dropped the reference to North Americans and just stuck with a general title.Despite this limitation, I would still recommend this book for general research and not specific to North American residents."
1,third-rate comp,"Shelling out big bucks for a psych comp is a risky move. I don't particularly object to the song collection or packaging (although there is more duplication than I would like) but the sound quality on the my CD's is horrible in my opinion. Virtually nothing is remastered that I can tell and everything is low and scratchy and there's reverb everywhere. In fact, I don't look forward to listening to this collection at all. If I got a bad batch of discs please let me know but based upon what I received, my cash would have been better spent elsewhere. The new ""Insane Times"" comp, while containing one fourth of the tracks, is far more enjoyable."
5,Text book that you should keep in your office,Helpfull beyond being helpful on effective business communication. Keep it handy you will use it frequently through out your career.
5,Exceptional source of information,This book is packed full of useful information. It will help you prepare and write messages the correct way. It tells you how to do persuasive writing to get your point across without sounding harsh. It is a great resource and I highly recommend it.
5,Great Service.,"I received this book within the stated date, in fact, sooner! Great service, excellent condition, and wonderful price!Thank you Amazon!"
4,great,I needed this book for my class and the owner sent it priority mail even though i didnt have the option on amazon so kudos to her and the book helped me a lot in my course would recommend it to anyone :)
1,Unsatisfied,"This product is a bootleg book. The front cover is color and the inside is black and white. At the very bottom of the cover it says, ""This edition is manufactured in India and is authorized for sale only in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Circulation of this edition outside of these territories is UNAUTHORIZED"". I'm very upset with the quality, I've purchased many books from Amazon in the past and this is the most unsatisfied that I've been. I paid $70 and would've preferred a used book compared to what I received."
1,Business communication today by Courtland L Bovee (Author),"i received the wrong book, the one that i looked up using the picture was it, then when clicking on a link for my book making it cheaper then got sent the wrong book, meaning i failed one of my exams due to it , re bought the book from e-bay."
2,Shipping concerns,"The book came promptly and it was what I ordered. I was dissapointed in that the book was just thrown in a box with no packing of any kind. Their were a few nicks on a new book because of it. I ordered it from amazon and not a private seller because I thought it was safer, but I guess not. I was impressed with the speed of the order."
4,The only complete book of business communication,"I did enjoy every page of this book, although I haven't read all of them. It's more an encyclopedia, which you may use in your day-to-day business, than something you will read straight through over the weekend. Very valuable and up-to-date were the chapters about intercultural and e-mail communication. Strong recommendation."
5,A great text,"This book is a great text to consider for class adoption. The wording is clear and is easy to read and relate to. Also, the book offers various examples through out the chapters, making it easy to understand."
4,check this first,"3 things you should know:1)The web site support links are dead, as is the contact phone number. The web site faqs are ok.2)You will need a full duplex sound card which can record and play back at the same time. Most laptops have half duplex. To check, double click your speaker icon to open volume control, if there is no microphone option then you don't have full duplex.3)You will need to run your solid body/pick up guitar through an amp, ie you will need an amp with a jack outlet to external speaker, which you then connect to your computer microphone jack. This is to give power to the signal from your pickups. If you have an acoustic with a microphone type pick up you can connect straight to the computer without going through an amp.Otherwise its pretty good and the interactive function is really engaging from what I've seen so far."
2,Interactive Guitar,"Program seems to be pretty old.. it has No Vista suport.. and dosen't want to work under XP with my Asus M3A Motherboards onboard sound. It works great on my Wifes XP rig. Sucks to have to use her comp.. so as a result i dont use this product, but, i payed close to 50 bucks for it. My loss is their gain. Becarefull buying this product."
5,Broken Bridges,Thanks for the quick shipment! I love this movie and had seen it on tv on several occasions. I wanted my dad to see it and he really liked it as well. I think it is a good movie displaying life challeges as they really are. I love the song the daughter sings! I'm glad that I have the movie! I will watch it for years to come. It is a keeper that I don't mind watching over now and then.
4,confused,"I enjoyed this movie, but I feel as though I missed something. When Angela gets the news about the accident, she tells Dixie (her daughter) that her father's brother is dead. Then when she gets home, she stays with her parents, and apparently its HER brother who has been killed. If Bo's brother was also killed, they didn't show his funeral. If it was Angela's brother who died, why did she say your father's brother. I didn't understand this."
4,Great Movie,"Heartwarming and gives you hope and strength. A very today movie that deals with family, love, loss, war and community. Personally made me think of my family member in the military."
5,BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN ALL YEAR!!!!,"I have always been a huge fan of Toby Keith but even more so after seeing this movie. It's a wonderful heartfelt feel good movie. My husband even loved the movie and he hates heart tugging movies...lol. It's a great movie to watch on a rainy lazy day to cuddle up in a warm blanket. I'm going to buy and I haven't bought a movie that I loved since ""Something to talk about"" came out on VHS."
3,Toby Keith's first acting gig,"I found this movie enjoyable, and as I am a huge Toby Keith fan, this just added to the enjoyment. A cameo role from Willie Nelson was also fantastic. Kelly Preston also did a great job. If you love cowboys, country music and just good old fashioned theme's then this one is for you."
5,Toby sure can pick 'em can't he ???,"Toby Keith's first foray into acting is an unqualified success. With a great story and a great cast of actors, Toby couldn't miss on this one. CMT must have been smiling from ear to ear when this premiered. A superstar doing a movie.... and it's good too ??? Toby admittedly, played it close to home, as a country music star, playing a country music star, but it's written so well I didn't care. Kelly Preston is, as always, a solid, steady quality actress, who is easily likable in any role she chooses to play. Lindsey Haun is a find. Cute, talented and believable as the daughter not too happy with her family situation. Burt Reynolds is still an actor with star power, although this isn't a big role for him.All in all I was very pleased with this movie, give it a chance and I think you will be too."
4,Lindsey Haun,"I didn't think I would like this movie, as it's not the usual genre I enjoy. However, I must say that Lindsey Haun (as the rebellious daughter) stole the show. She turned in a marvelous performance that made this movie worth watching. Even if you don't like country music or feelgood/romance films, you should check this film out for her alone. Her song Broken - although billed as country - is excellent, and could easily cross over into rock/pop charts too.The song is also available for download at iTunes."
5,An old fashioned movie!,"This is a terrific story with good music and a fun cast. The sound track is a keeper, too. Toby Keith is not just another pretty face. :-)- -And wait until you hear ""Broken"" sung by a terrific young singer, Lindsey Haun! Beautiful!"
2,Corny and Predicatable,"Potentially a good story. but, unfortunately this one was not put together well, extremely dull with poor transitioning--boring with a cliche redneck theme. The only reason I stuck it out to the end was to see the young girl sing; she gave an excellent performance. It seems all the other actors were asleep or in some kind of trance through the movie."
3,imaginary,"well, my review well the DVD has not turned up therefore i am having difficulty coming up with an appropriate review, but your lucky as out of all the movies i've bought from amazon this is yhe only one to go astray i previously rented this movie from blockbuster so i new i liked the movie it is a little weak in the story line but i like the songs"
1,Not for me,"I just want everyone to know that I bought this for my mother. Don't want anyone to think I want this movie in any way. You couldn't pay me to watch this. It would easily classify as a MST3K experience for me. As a matter of fact there would be one way I would watch it and thats if the guys at MST3K did a send up. So there you go. By the way I didn't know Kelly Preston was that hard up for parts. By the way Toby Keith is a phony, If he cares so much for america you think he'd stop doing pot which is a bad influence on kids. And then there's all those songs about the troops, You'ld think he'd give some of those profits to Vet org like the dixie chicks do. But I guess he's too stoned."
1,DON'T ORDER FROM CapCityOutlet.,"When I received my DVD I was anxious to see the movie again that I had enjoyed on TV. There was NO enjoyable viewing with static noises, streaking lines, flashing lines, fading in and out, etc.I emailed the sender twice but have received no reply.When you order a movie you expect to enjoy it but this was frustrating and very annoying. Much of the dialog was lost."
5,Toby,"Really a good movie. One of lifes tales and really hits home. A must see at lease once, it will be more for me."
5,I love this movie,"Awesome actors and actresses, soundtrack is great, and the movie goes without saying, well worth the incestment, Thank you Kelly Preston, Tobey Keith, BB Winens, Willie Nelson, and Burt Reynolds !"
5,Great family movie!,My husband and I both loved it and now it is going to my daughters house for her and her 8 children to watch.
5,Broken Bridges,This movie is one of my favorites! I watch it often. Love the music in it. This is not a movie for children though.
5,good movie for all,"we thought this might be more of a chick flick but watched it on CMT and had to have a copy. We have loaned it out to family and friends and they have all liked it in the end. Full of known charachters and appearances by Willie himself. definitely recommend it. Bought the CD as well, great music."
2,Not so great,I thought this was rather disappointing as the the three principal actors were all at least ten years too old for their roles. The plot was simplistic and really unbelievable. This is for Toby Keith fans who really don't care how bad this movie is as long as he is in it. I liked the music. Toby...don't quit your day job!
3,No Place to Start,"Joshi is the big gun in Lovecraft studies, but this is not the Big Book. It's a collection of essays which were mostly intros to other books, now recycled. By all means read Joshi on Lovecraft. There is a one-volume and a two-volume biography, two volumes of annotated Lovecraft, and AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS with an introduction ammounting to a critical study. Joshi also edited the new editions from Arkham House. But this one's only for the completist. I'm a Lovecraft completist, but not a Joshi completist. That said, if you've never read Joshi on Lovecraft before, about half of this one would go down nicely."
2,Not as Described,"The product is a nice product, it does keep the car smelling nice, but the thing is, there is no description of how big the PRODUCT actually is, all they tell us is the shipping weight, nobody cares about the shipping weight, we want the product weight, and the thing itself is about 2.5 Ounces so its very small, this is cheaper at the local auto stores"
1,Yet another piece of emo tripe...,The commercials are just another bland emo band in a sea filled with them.
4,Outstanding,"It doesn't get much better than Tjader and Getz together. The only thing that I can criticize about this release, is that there isn't enough here and you're left longing for more.A good, strong release...made at great points in Tjader and Getz's respective careers.You'll ejoy this (all too brief) one."
4,"Short but sweet, with 2 masters at their height..","This is a great pairing of talent, as well as of style. Yes, it leaves you wanting more, but what is here is special. An extra added treat on this one is the really great guitar playing of Eddie Duran, whose playing, especially on his harmony lines with Stan, give this recording added appeal. What a great player. ""Ginza Samba"", ""Crow's Nest"", and ""Liz-Anne"" are my favorites, though everything else shines as brightly."
3,"Great Music, but....","I agree with the positive comments about the playing and the compositions, however you just ought to be aware, if you are in any way an audiophile, that this is not a great sounding recording. I don't know about the original master recording but I don't think that this cd does it justice. It is just an older cd, back from when the ""Perfect Sound..."" wasn't all it was cracked up to be. I don't know if it has been remastered more recently, but if you care it would be worth looking into."
4,Lovely memories,I like it very much because it brings up memory from my childhood when I saw these episodes on tv. I recommend it to everyone as myself that adores the fab 60ties lifestyle in clothing and interior design.
1,Broken on arrival,"Very disappointed, the box was undamaged but the hopper and lid of the grinder were clearly broken, most likely at the factory before it was packed. I really expected more from Rancilio."
4,"A bit spendy, but...","...it's worth it! This is a SOLID machine that has a commercial feel. All the experts recommend spending at least as much on your grinder as you do on your espresso maker. Considering most $300 espresso makers are not that great, the Rocky is actually a a money-saving investment. (OK, I know that's not totally logical, but it can help take some of the sting out of paying $500+ for an espresso machine...) Personally, I use a stovetop espresso maker and have found the Rocky produces excellent grinds for it. Most users probably won't need to use even a fraction of the settings on the dial (*really* is there that much of a difference between 18 and 19 when you have 40 grind settings?), however, if you buy lots of different kinds of beans, this can come in handy. The only improvement I might suggest is to make the top of the bean hopper seal more tightly. I think it lets in too much air, so I rarely fill it all the way up. Win by TKO!"
4,"Well built, sturdy.","The Doserless Rancilio is a bit confusing in why they designed certain features, but never the less it grinds well, is sturdy, and grinds to great precision. I suggest placing a small bowl underneath the chute, and then either pouring into the coffee filter or filling the espresso handle.For those that want this for only espresso, the doser version might be a fine idea.I do not expect to replace this in my lifetime."
5,Simply superb,"If you like a great espresso, this is perhaps one of the very few ways to go. The machine grinds the coffee to perfection."
5,The grinder? The doser?,"The grinder makes a huge difference in espresso, when you take advantage of its precision. On my last lot of beans, a grinder setting of 12 produced something like brewed coffee, while 10 justified the price of this machine. For me, anyway, it takes time to find the right balance of coffee amount, grind, tamping, and extraction time. New beans need a new balance.As to the doser: If you usually grind for one espresso at a time then you seriously do not want the doser getting in your way."
5,Rocky Grinder - PERFECTO!,The Rocky grinder is so incredible. Tons of horse power and a consistent grind. I grind for espresso and I can increment the grind size in slight increments according to how well the espresso is making it through the porta-filter on my espresso machine. Awesome way to fine tune and adjust according to the quality and age of the beans.Built like a pro grinder - heavy duty!Regarding the decision of dosser vs. dosserless: If you are going to us this as a COMMERCIAL grinder and pour shot after shot - go with a dosser for measuring convenience. But you will always have some of your ground coffee sitting in the hopper.If you're making your espresso's one at a time - go dosserless. Then you're getting your coffee freshly grounded just before you use it.
3,Coffee Grinder,works great but they should not have it where you have to keep your finger on the switch to grind
1,"MESSY and Hassle, not ideal for home use","Husband purchased this unit after reading so many positive reviews. Problem is, he is not the one who uses it. I do, and I really do dislike it.Our prior burr grinder was great until a guest broke it trying to run something through it that wasn't coffee beans. This was the third unit we got in the new go around.It seems to be intended *ONLY* for espresso making. It makes an awful mess, as the grinds go everywhere due to static electricity.I grind both for espresso and drip. To grind for drip, need to have a tupperware to catch the grinds. Also have to stand there holding the button down, can't turn it ""on"" and let it grind as much as i need.In addition to the mess, it routinely stops grinding - just does a low moan. Then I have to take the lid off of the hopper, stir the beans around with my finger, reset the grind dial two or three times to get it going again."
1,"value stock, growth stock","This book best qualify as a novel. A bunch of stories. It is hard to beleive that a book on investing doesn't mention and explain stock market strategies like value stock. growth stock, P/E...etc"
4,Scuttlebut method is not pratical,Fisher 15 points are great for qualiative analysis of a company. But his methods for finding this informaion is not pratical. Fisher suggests interveiwing the managers for info not pratical for average investor.
4,"Elegant, good value, full of helpful advice and examples","I love using this book for several reasons. The entire text is gracefully handwritten in Copperplate by this Master Penman. He has a very beautiful, elegant style and technically impressive nib control.The book was published in 1987 and the author born in 1915, at the tail end of the `old-world', when Spencerian and Copperplate scripts were more widely practiced and enjoyed. I like the fact that he must have been about 70 years old when he prepared this work, making his steady hand, smooth and fluid hairlines all the more notable.An aspect I particularly value and enjoy is that, unlike some Copperplate books where every stroke is absolutely perfect, this work is presented unretouched. As such it is far more 'human' and shows me what I can realistically aspire to.Elegant, very useful, great value for money, highly recommended!"
3,"Good, basic instructions. Examples could be better.","This book is good for the price. The examples could be better. I've seen great examples from other teachers. It is worth the money invested and a good, starter for people who want to learn copperplate or engrosser's script."
5,basics of copperplate calligraphy,"This book explains the technique of copperplate calligraphy and is written in the copperplate style. It calls for a pointed pen. The technique consists of straight and curved strokes, capitals, and numerals.Techniques as copperplate are especially important in producing cursive, lettering certificates, or addressng evelope. It is essential in being a well-rounded calligrapher."
5,Nilsson rules,what can I say about the man with THE voice of gold. I love his music and this CD is no exception. Its an album that everyone should listen to when they're feeling melancholic. I can only wonder what he may have achieved if he were still alive today. Everybody's talkin should be a part of the collection of all good music connoisuer.
2,filmed in one day on a video camera,"its is only when you stop in the supermarket to have a sneaky look in the 'bargain bin' that you discover gems like this. the director must have a few favours he can call upon as the cast, at first glance, is top quality, espcially for independant movie.this film is so bad its hard to watch, but you just cant drag yourself away from the screen. the script is straight out of tarrantios trash can. the characters are from his recycling bin.this is like an airplane stle pisstake of pulp fiction or kill bill but i dont think they were joking. previous reviews referred to david carradine nailing his scene - the tiger stripe silk gown is cetainly a classic - and we are left wondering what happened to previous guy who, in order to claim a favour, had to screw his pet dwarf, roland.watch if only to see how bad it can get."
5,rocking action film,I loved this film. Its a different take on the an indie action film. It feels very noir. I loved all the cameos from peple like Michael Madsen and this is sadly the last film David Carradine did- but he is great in it. Fun action scenes and a great new indie stars are in this film
5,Great As Usual !!,"""Colors"" is just another wonderful project from the mighty Oak Ridge Boys. Age isn't slowing them down....if fact, I think they are speeding up!! I've been a fan for over 20 years now and will be until the end!! They do it better than ANYONE!!"
3,Oak Ridge Boys Colors,"I just received this album in the mail. The first thought I had was, wouldn't Steve Sanders have loved to be on this album. I noticed they used the same musical arrangement on ""Thank God For Kids"" that they used on the ""Country Christmas Eve"" album which featured Steve. As far as all the hype over this being the best Oaks album yet, I'll have to say I was disappointed. They have done better in the past. It seems to drag on and on with a lack of the typical Oaks style. Also, for an Oak Ridge Boys patriotic album, they should have included American Made and Take Pride In America. But even if it isn't their best effort, it still sounds great, and I'm still an Oaks fan for life."
5,"Thank you, Amazon for selling this",Love The Oak Ridge Boys and Old time GospelVery pleased with the purchase
5,"Fabulous bag, great value!","Our son is nearly 5 months old now and I still love this bag. It is roomy enough for everything you need for baby, plus with the cell phone holder and makeup bag you don't need to use an additional purse. It is very practical and durable, but also has a stylish look. It doesn't scream diaper bag, it could just as easily pass as a tasteful handbag. LOVE IT!"
5,great diaper bag,This diaper bag is great! All the compartments no need for a purse. I am a mom of three and this diaper bag is wonderful a little pricey but worth it. I would recommend this bag to everyone.
1,rip off of Sheryl Crow fans,"hi,This is a complete rip off. It is literally her songs sung by one unknown generic artist or group - not a tribute by various artists as advertised. The artist is not bad, but this is CD is worthless. Save your money."
2,a mixed trash bag,"I was disappointed by this one. I had finished the Carpetbaggers, and was looking forward to reading another Harold Robbins book, but this one was really sleazy and for Robbins, that's saying a lot. I didn't like any characters in the book and the whole focus of the book seemed to be super deviant sex. I am no prude and I like his other books. I mean how many times must I read phallus on one page? Robbins does make you want to keep reading so you know what happens but by the time I got to the end, I didn't care. Not like the Carpetbaggers which I wish never ended. Skip it!"
2,its is getting worst and worst,"The first part of the book, the story of Tanya is excellent, is a page turner and you will not be able to put the book down, but when Tanya is gone the book is getting worst at each chapter and the writer begins to write and write things that doesn't have to do with the main story, you will also read some parts that medically are impossible (and I am not a medical doctor), but when a woman has an hysterectomy as young as 18, she can't get plastic surgery and she has to take many pills to feel good and she can't make a diet to be a model, NO WAY, as this are many things that can't be possible."
4,Essential Introduction to Kievan Rus',"This book is a classic in the study of Kievan Rus' and is a must read for anyone interested in the subject. The style can seem a bit stuffy at times, but this is not overbearing and is offset by the wealth of information."
5,My favorite so far,"I've only read the first three, but this is by far my favorite. The first volume is an introduction to the concept, the third is a sort of detour from the main storyline (or maybe not, can't be sure) but the second one is great. It's artwork is nice, the characters are wonderful, and the storyline seemed to be building itself up."
1,Rubbish,"Well, I started reading this and stopped after a few pages. It's pretty filthy stuff, don't read it if you enjoy quality literature."
3,broad elaboration based on scanty evidence,"Consciousness is a thorny subject to begin with. Arsuaga tries to find it in the humanoid fossil record. Because there isn't enough material there, he gives a generalized story of the evolution of mankind, wanders into the vegetation of Spain and gets lost in the world of philosophy of language and consciousness. Info on Neaderthal life is little given the title of the book.The book is clearly written with love for the subject but the premise doesn't legitimize a 300 paged book. There is just to little flesh on that Neanderthal bone to put your teeth in.For an outstanding introduction into the field of human evolution read ""From Lucy to to Language"" by Donald Johanson & Blake Edgar. If you are interested in consciousness read Antonio Damasio or Dashiel Dennett."
1,A terrible treatment of an intriguing concept.,"I ignored the negative publisher's weekly review, thinking to myself, ""Nevermind, self, it's an interesting concept, and I can burrow my way through digressions.""Alas, the publisher's weekly review describes a real, significant problem with this book. The text digresses, wanders, meanders, and then digresses some more. If it did this with some verve or charm, it might be forgivable--but the voice is monotonous, failing to distinguish between important and trivial information.I am not uninformed on the underlying subject, but I'm not an expert either. Perhaps to other physical anthropologists, this text is fascinating--or at least informative. Alas, it is neither for the layperson, even the informed one."
1,The Neanderthal's Necklace,"I most definitely do not recommend this book if the reader wishes to learn something about the Neanderthals. Actually, there is virtually nothing in the book about the Neanderthals and their culture, but there is a lot of information on the late Pleistocene environments of the Iberian Peninsula. This book is mostly natural history, not archaeology. I do not recommend it."
3,"Interesting topic, poorly organized book.","I was disappointed by this book. It reads like the transcript of a university lecture given by a bright and enthusiastic professor. That said, the author's frequent asides and digressions make it difficult to follow his narrative."
3,Eh.....it's okay.,"Being a fan of tribute albums and having already been impressed by Anthems of Rust and Decay, I had high hopes for this album when I first bought it. After listening to it a few times...well, my hopes were a bit lowered. While I am a fan of Apoptygma Berzerk, I don't really think they captured the futility and loss that comes through Manson's own Coma White. The covers of Disposable Teens and I Don't Like the Drugs are just nowhere near the originals in talent, and the Beautiful People, Lunch Box and Cake and Sodomy were fairly mutilated. BUT...I can say for certain that Great Big White World and Mechanical Animals, by Maya Hyena and Pure Drama, respectively, are some of the best music I have heard on a tribute album. They did an excellent job, and I would buy each of their own albums if I could find them. My suggestion: by it used from a friend if you really want it, but I wouldn't pay full price for it again."
5,The best book ever,"This is the best book I have ever read. I've never been a reader and then one day my boss said she had a book I should read. I hoped she'd for get to bring it in but she didn't. So I started reading the first chapter about her Barbies and remebered playing with mine in almost the same way with out all the fetish Barbies. Then I couldn't put it down, I related to Anna Koval and her gay best friend. I can't stop wanting to read it again to see if I missed something. At the end of the book I was almost sad it was over I loved it so much and it made me want to read a 1,000 book just like it. If I had to use one word to describe this book I couldnt it's funny, amazing, entertaining, and just let me stop there I could go on for ever."
2,Funny yet not sympathetic,"There are some genuinely amusing and touching moments, and it's nice to read a book that incorporates some common language and experiences amongst young women in my generation. At first I sympathized with the character of Anna, who is experiencing something of an identity crisis after a bad breakup and a family tragedy. However, after a while Anna becomes completely unsympathetic as she basically lies and deceives her way through most of the book. The ending was completely unbelievable--straight out of Sex and the City or some other horrible romantic comedy. Insecurity and the need for human love and contact are issues that I think most people can empathize with; the length of deception to which Anna goes, however, was not a quality I could admire at all."
3,It started out so good...,"but then it went downhill fast. The first several chapters were laugh-out-loud-I-can't-wait-for-someone-I-know-to-read-this-so-we-can-laugh-about-it-together funny! I kept thinking, ""I have to loan this to EVERYONE, so they can enjoy it!"" But then about halfway through it got sooo dull and predictable--the same old chick lit. It was basically Bridgett Jones with a little Carrie Bradshaw mixed in with it. NO ORIGINAL IDEAS! I will probably still recommend it to my friends, but now with the warning that it disappoints in the end."
2,Not the best book I'll ever read,"Sometimes you have to wonder what inspired a writer, because the concept is just so...bad. When I read this, I had to assume it was a first time writer who wrote this. It's not so bad, if that's the case.I think this writer has to work on developing her characters more. Her characters didn't evoke any emotion in me. They were fake, and you could tell. I didn't care about Anna's past relationship, or really, any of the stories that she wrote. You can tell in some points, it's supposed to be funny, but it just felt short most of the time, though I did crack a small smile a few times.So basically, if you're looking for a faintly amusing time-passer, this is the book for you. If you're looking for an epic with heavy characters and themes...look elsewhere."
4,Fun distraction with some major interpersonal drama,"Ribon's debut novel is a sure-fire winner for anyone who enjoys interpersonal drama and gossiping. This is a delicious guilty pleasure of a story about twenty-something Anna, who begins an online journal about her life. She embellishes a few details (mainly, that she is still with her ex-boyfriend Ian) and her funny tales earn her a larger fan base than she is aware of. She begins email correspondence with one charming male fan named LDobler and becomes the idol of a younger fan named Tess.Of course, all her embellishments, as well as some true personal details, cause some serious entanglements in Anna's life. Anna is a terrific narrator because she is far from the stereotypical scenester blogger. She's a down-to-earth girl trying to recover from a broken relationship and find her place in the world. Very fun read."
1,I don't understand why everyone liked this book...,"As a writer of novels and journals alike, I can immediatly point out Ribon's big mistake. She wasn't writing a novel here, she was writing a background story to go around the showcase of her favorite journal entries! She didn't seems to be writing the story for the sake of Anna, but for the sake of showing off her own journal and funniness. The actual story here is weak, just a casing for the journal entries, which Ribon clearly wrote her story around so that they would fit into the ""plot"". I didn't appriciate her assuming her readers would be fooled into seeing this as a novel, and you know what? It wasn't even that funny, guys! The humor was low brow and tacky. So, that's my opinion."
4,A very entertaining read,"I got this book mostly for the blogging aspect of it...and was pleasantly surprised when I found myself pulled into it and watching this girl keep her lies on line straight with post-it notes. I was especially loving her character Dale...I want a DALE to be my friend.Anyway, I found it intriguing with a good storyline. Solid characters, and it is easy to distinguish between the parts that are Anna Koval and her online personality Anna K. I found this book easy to relate to and recommend it...even if you don't blog."
5,This was THE FUNNIEST book I've read all year...,"I loved this book. In essence it is about all of the bizare things that people do or think about that no one really ever discusses. It's very REAL and HONEST. I could totally relate to the author and found myself saying ""OMG I thought that to,"" or ""I'm not the only one!"" From the Barbies to the TINY HAND to boobs... this book will crack you up! It's totally worth buying!"
4,People who don't like the book just don't get it....,"Having been a guilty fan of weblogs and online journals for a while now, I really enjoyed reading about things from the other side of the computer...the characters were fresh and real (I'm from austin, so I know all the sights in the book) and her unwillingness to let go of her last relationship...that rung true. Its an easy read(I finished it in one day) but it left me satisfied."
4,Good Stuff,"I've been a pamie fan for a couple of years. I read squishy (although I'm not sure how I came across it) and now read pamie.com. I was very interested to see how the book was in comparison.I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I did skim some of the stuff I had read before, but I really loved the new stuff. I couldn't help wondering throughout the book things like, ""so, were those entries part truths and part lies?"", ""is pamie keeping 3M in business?"", ""is LD really XXXX and are they together?"", etc.. Happily, I found one answer in the acknowledgements. My loud ""WOO HOO!"" scared the ...cat and took a few years off my husband's life. That alone was worth the price of the book. I mean the good news, not that my husband will now be dying a few years before his time."
3,The next wave of novels - blog chick lit.,"An early entrant to the blogging world, and now an early entrant to the world of semi-autobiographical rehash. Sure, we've all written blog entries that we feel are so clever that they deserve a greater audience. It just felt weird paying for something I had read already for free.As I read the book, sometimes I felt that the book was being written so fast that details were left out. At times the book would be so specific, then it wouldn't. It left me feeling like movies where there are only got two hours to tell the story so we can enter ""suspension of belief"" land.That being said, it was an engaging read, and didn't disappoint. The scene in the bar where a man tells her what he wants to do to her is one of the single greatest ""wish that was me"" moments I've read. I had say, ""Wow"" on that one."
2,no satisfaction,"I loved Pamie's site for years. Thought the book was terrible, but it might be funny to you if you didn't know how much funnier and deeper the site could be. And I kind of feel the ""woe is me, it is so hard to be a famous blogger"" shtick is pretty annoying, like, I'm sorry that you wrote stuff that people responded to, and I know it got a little crazy and cultlike here and there, but I also remember that being encouraged on the site of yore. Anyway. The book was a big letdown (and even a turnoff) for me, but I can imagine it might be enjoyable if you don't have any expectations."
4,Or: Why girls are wired,"True life gets confused with the personality and life Anna has created for herself on an Internet diary of sorts. Fact and fiction become blurred, forcing Anna to decide who she really is and what roles she truly wants the various men in her life to play.Easy beach read."
2,Eeeh...,"This book was simply ""OK.""1. The characters were flat. I felt like they were all written in the same voice. There wasn't much differentiation between Anna, Kurt, and Dale. Her sisters were one-dimensional caricatures. No one felt ""real."" Even Smith, who seemed to be the most separate personality, seemed forced.2. The story played on too many cliches, such as the misunderstanding between Kurt and Anna. We've seen that before; it's not funny on Friends, and it's not funny now.3. The story also played on stereotypes of women, which was annoying (e.g. all women want to get married).I've read her web site and found it fairly good, but I was never fanatic in the least. Saying that, the web site humor did not translate that well into book form. There could have been so much more there with online journal vs. real life, but she never delved deep. It was way too breezy and light without being that funny."
5,wow..i laughed,This was a great book. The plot was great. Pamela Ribon definitely did a wonderful job. Starting out with The House Of Smut [you'll have to read to find out] and I can't believe they actually let something like this be published. Anna Koval seemed like a real person to me and I really was disappointed when I realized she wasn't. It seems that she based Anna Koval slightly on herself and life experience. This is a must read!!
1,NOT WATER PROOF,"Ok, i got this cover because of the reviews written about it handling the rain. Those who wrote those reviews must work for Dura-Trak and should be ashamed of themselves. The day this cover came in the rain i put it on my bike. The next day i checked and the cover stayed on securely through the night. Then it rained, not light but not that hard. After the rain i decided to ride my bike to go see a friend. I removed the cover to find my bike completely covered in water. I have a new seat that had a puddle of water sitting on it. Needless to say i am not only trying to return the cover but get the return shipping paid for because this cover is junk and now my brand new seat has seen rain. If you love your bike as much as i love mine, you know how upset i am now. Do not get this cover if you want to keep your ride dry."
2,not waterproof,"I was optimistic because of the few positive reviews, but unfortunately this cover just did not keep my motorcycle dry in any substantial rain. You can tell just by feeling it too that water will eventually seep through. I'm now searching for a replacement on Amazon."
3,Doesn't repel water well,The cover is pretty durable but it doesn't repel water very well. I need to carry around a towel to dry my bike off after every storm.
4,Good dust cover.,I use this to cover my Cycle in the garage. For that purpose this is a great cover. I have never used this product outside but given the quality I would suspect it would do well.The cover is soft and should not hurt the finish of most bikes.
3,Fits Great but water repeller?,I was a little skeptical at first when I opened the package. I thought that there was no way that it would fit my scooter since I have mirrors and a storage department that extends outward. But to my surprise it fit fantastically and was very easy to put on as compared to my other motorcycle cover. The other motorcycle cover repels water beautifully. This one is cloth and I am not sure how well it will repel water especially Texas rain. I hope that I am as pleasantly surprised as I was upon my initial reaction when I first opened the package. The cloth material seems durible and breatheable. The price was very reasonable.
4,Great overall product,"I really enjoy this product. I know some people may complain about not having a strap on the bottom, but to be honest..my previous cover had a strap and the strap lead to me burning my arm on the hot pipe as I was strapping it from the bottom.....The product does what it says....Sturdy..tough, outlasted the rain and bike is dry as ever...even after a few thunderstorms from Jersey...."
2,Not very durable or stable,Tore very easily after just a couple times of putting on the bike. Doesn't attach very well; flies off easily when it's windy.
4,low price way to hear some talented bands that sound similar,"I agree with some of the points the first reviewer had about the ""sameness"" of the bands. But for me, these 2 CDs play well and sound similar to one band with several different lead singers, making for a good listen. It is enjoyable if you like the Hammerfall and/or Rhapsody style of power metal. This collection showcases many bands, maybe too many for one label. Problem is there is not much that separates one band from the other, having no one rising to the top to stand out. Too bad. One positive is that there are bands still playing this style of music and getting signed to a decent sized label for better exposure. If you like power metal, try this, it is a lot of music for the money and most of the songs are average at the worst. You never know, you might find a few new favorite bands here."
3,A gift,"Feedback from my son -in law, a N Dakota cowboy, was very good for working on equipment in shed, and will be useful in barn during calving. Says it throws nice heat, a bonus in the winter. Rugged enough to last."
3,Good enough.....for now,"I purchased this to put in my woodshop to provide some much need light. While it does provide excellent light, it also get extremely hot. As a matter a fact, it provides more heat than the little heater I bought for the woodshop that is just about useless. Some of the parts on this light are made of plastic and seem very fragile."
4,Designers Edge 1000w work light,"Pkg arrived very quickly with Amazon Prime ... however, the packaging inside the shipping casing was absolutely destroyed (like it was opened by a 5 year old on Xmas morning).Why it was included when shipped is a mystery. It was obvious that it was a reconditioned set.Both bulbs burned out within hours of use (I assume because they have hours of use already). The replacement bulbs that I bought have been working fine.The unit throws great light with minimal shadows due to the protective wire casing. A byproduct of (2) 500w bulbs is extreme heat.For the price -$40 ... you can't beat it."
3,"Ok quality, but poor design","This was a great work light... for about a day. Assembly was a breeze. One minor problem is that the lights do not tilt down to the ground. The biggest complaint that I have is that around the bolt holes which control the tilt, there is not much metal surrounding the hole. There is not much support. Unfortunately, while tilting the light a piece of metal broke off around the bolt hole which made the tilt no longer work. If you don't break it, it can be a great light. You have to be gentle!"
3,Cheap is right,"An earlier reviewer remarked that it is cheap. It is certainly built cheaply but it seems to work. The assembly instructions are the usual (awful) but if you ignore them and just look at the picture you can probably build it. The safety grills do NOT install as per the instructions, they just snap in place. The lights won't swivel downward, pretty stupid for a light that comes on a tall tripod. The swivel stop can probably be removed with a small grinder or Dremel tool to allow swiveling down. The light is REALLY bright, maybe too much so."
2,Misleading,"This product would be alright if you want a halogen light. It came up in a search for LED lighting and has a part number with LED in it. I sent it back, as it was not what I wanted."
1,Quality is no.1 from the bottom....,"Got my first one, broken base plastic piece at the bottom of the tripod. Requested for an exchange, then broken tripod adjustment knob and missing bolt on the light handle. Give up trying to get a functional set, requested a refund. I seriously don't mind paying $10 more and have something that doesn't look like jerry-rigged from some scrap metal."
4,"Good light, but be gentle with it","A fine, bright light. When daylight savings time was over this light allowed me to finish several outdoor projects during the evening hours. I had to be careful as to how I positioned the light to avoid blinding local car traffic.The lights weakness would be the the numerous twist-collars that lock the tripod into various positions. Don't over-tighten these and the whole setup should last a long time."
3,get the job done,the tripod feels like it's going to fall apart but so far so good. Lights are great. I don't like with the lights not being able to shine down. It's ether straight or up not down. Over all it a good buy for the price and it gets the job done.
2,Would not recommend,"Ordered three of this product and two were broken in the exact same spot, I think due to cheap materials and shoddy packing. Waste of time and effort mailing them back. The lights are extremely hot and now I worry about possible fire."
4,Good value for the price,"I'm glad I purchased this light, so far it's been excellent at illuminating my basement workshop area and once setup properly is stable and should serve me well for a long time to come. Be sure to tighten the plastic collars that secure the main pole snug, not super tight, you don't want to break them.I must admit I read allot of bad reviews for this type of work light but this model/brand seemed a bit above the rest going by reviews. This was a good buy."
5,Perfect,"Exactly what I needed. Easy to build up, easy to handle, not to heavy but solid. Cable could be a little longer."
4,Impressive....good traditional merengue,"Alex Bueno is definitely one of the most versatile singers of tropical music no doubt about it. We have seen his solid talent in the following musical categories: merengue, bachata, bolero and balada but this cd has to be categorized as his best ever. In this album he has revived what is called ""música criolla"" and has reminded us of the nuances, rhythms and beats that are unique to dominican style merengue. Each song exemplifies its essence and the soulfulness that always is typical of this kind of merengue. This showcase of music which is definitely in a class by itself can be enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of tropical rhythms with lively beats and unique instrumentation. Alex's voice is outstanding and like most of his productions the cd can be played from beginning to end. Every song is worthy of recognition. If you are a fan of Alex Bueno, don't miss out on this one. This album is a treasure. Strong recommendation given."
2,I have better capos,"It's ok, but I prefer the spring-loaded ones. The screw came out once which I was afraid would render it useless, but I was able to get it back in with relative ease.UPDATE: JAN 25, 2012I've been using this capo often since I purchased it. Even though it wasn't my favorite capo, it some how ended up in my guitar case when ever I was doing a show. It's broken completely now and totally worthless. I've dropped it some, but I would have expected it to hold up better than it has. It feels like good construction, but it turns out not to hold up well at all. Because of this, I have decreased my number of stars by one.Bottom line: If you coddle this capo, you may get years of use out of it, but if you want a capo that can handle a few drops and actual stage use, forget about it."
2,Sort of Cheesy,"Helmut is poor quality. Not much better than saran wrap. Remainder of costume is OK, but not great. Not worth the price. Irwin Mainway would have done better."
