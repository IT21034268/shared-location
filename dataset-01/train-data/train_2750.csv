5,Well done creative book for children,This is a children's picture book that encourages creative thinking. The pictures follow a logical sequence so a child can make up their own story by filling in the details. At the beginning of the book is a poem that can be used for guidance on how the author meant the story to be viewed. The poem is printed in both English and Spanish for those who are learning one or the other of the languages. Ocean Whisper is a fun book for parent and child to enjoy together and recommended for creative thinking.
5,sweet dreams,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends OCEAN WHISPER/SUSURRO DEL OCEANO no matter what your mother tongue is, because... other than the flyleaves & the opening poem in both English & Spanish, this bedtime story is told all in picture... gorgeous, dreamy pictures of the life to be found in the deep blue sea.Of shells & sounds, fishes & water, whales & mermaids, aquariums & dreams, all exquisitely illustrated by Dennis Rockhill.A lovely way to fill your children's minds as they ready for sleep."
4,Not as sweet as some but very good on salads,"I'm no expert, so I can't comment on the qualities that experts grade. I just love using balsamic vinegar on my salads and grade by how it tastes to me. And to me, this balsamic vinegar tastes very good, even though not quite as sweet as the best I've ever tasted. At the price, it's definitely worth trying."
4,Patience has its rewards,"This is an amazing CD. Initially, I was disappointed because the drumming at the outset seemed tedious. But waiting paid off! The drumming increased in its rhythmic complexity and beauty as the CD went on to its conclusion. One should understand the context of the playing so I strongly suggest reading the liner notes. I would love to attend such a meeting of master musicians heightened by the spiritual context. This Cd would appeal more to those interested in the religion of Islam and its cultural manifestations. Brilliant music. They could have telescoped the beginning minutes down quite a bit. Then I would have given it 5 stars."
1,Bargain Basement Baseball,"This game is being deeply discounted and it shows. The players all look the same, no variety to their physique (even MacGwire looks skinny!). The batting interface is sloppy; it's hard to judge where to swing at the pitch. Pitching is OK, but handled better by the other current titles. The variety of parks is very good. About the only thing I enjoy about the game is the home run derby (because the pitches come in fast and straight), although it works best with sluggers. Finally, for a game this lame 8 blocks of card memory is a waste."
3,"Good, but nothing to write home about","These sheets are ok, nothing great. They are a little rough to be Sateen and they're heavy but at 800 TC they should be. We've only washed them once so we're hoping they soften up a lot. The fitted sheet is supposed to fit an 18"" mattress, our mattress is 16"" and the sheet pulls off the corners every night. They won't fit an 18"" mattress pure and simple. For the price we can't complain too much as the sheets they replaced were Hilton Hotel sheets and they didn't fit either at 4 times the cost. These sheets seem to be made ok but only time will tell on the durability."
2,Not that great,"While the sheets feel good when first opened, a few washes reveals that they bobble very easily. Certainly not a luxury product."
1,Agree Agree Agree,"I am actually surprised at the number of negatives, thought that there would be some loyal blinded bose fans writing review.Look, Bose really made a name for itself in the 70's early 80's when they had decent bookshelf speakers, they have totally fallen behind with the advent of surround sound, prologic, thx etc.I agree with many of the comments that the cube speakers are totally worthless, sounds like you are playing a mono am channel. The subwoofer is the worst part of the system, my $50 altec lansing computer speaker system sub blows it away.Needless to say I will never get sucked into another bose product since i am forced to by a new surround speaker system because of the complete and utter bose inadequacy"
1,this is no good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We bought this system for our home. We bought it as an investment that we would have for years. Bose is supposed to be some of the best speakers on the market. We have Bose 601 speakers and they are awesome. This system sucks and I wouldn't recomend anyone spending $1,000 on this system. You should go to Wal-mart and buy the cheapest boom box they sale and get the same effect. Please concider what I am saying and try something else. We bought sony and it is much better. If you buy it anyway make sure it has a 100% money back guarantee. Thanks for reading my review."
3,An ok read,"I was expecting a little more from Jackie with this book. It was still an enjoyable read but nowhere in the league of some of Jackie's other books like ""Chances""."
4,It was great!!!!,"It was a totally cool book, but it was not as good as the other books: Lucky, Chances, Lovers and Gamblers ... But it was still good!!! The story was interesting and has romace and all, and is very emotional and sad!! The ending was prety good though!!"
4,Surprisingly inspiring book,"I loved that little book. There are many touching examples of the boxer's great heart - one example I remember is when the family was delayed for boarding because he was signing autographs. He got on the plane with his daughter, and found that a father and his son had moved from coach and were sitting in their first class seats. He just asked the boy if he had ever sat in first class. Boy replied 'no, never'. He replied 'it's your lucky day !' and went to sit in coach.I am not really into poems too much, and there are a few of them in there. However, the insights into the personality of the man who was part of 'Rumble in the Jungle' are just priceless."
5,Inspirational,"I thought the book was tops because,it was an inspiration to all black people and it tells how everyone can make their dreams come true and you can make a difference in other peoples lives. I recommend this book...why because like I said it was inspirational to me. I enjoyed the style of writing because after the story of what happened in Muhammad's life it had a nice poems. People that need someone to look up to would enjoy reading this book. So please read it. I loved it!"
1,Pap,"Total and utter sheer pap, glurge and mush.Ali isn't just the most written about boxer ever, he's also the most written about athlete. What a shame that most of the books written about him, like his mushy tribute from one of his many daughters, totally whitewash (no pun intended) one of the most controversial and intriguing figures of the 20th century. I wish somebody would write a biography of Ali that told it like it is, good and bad."
2,Missing In Action,"Great book, but how can he leave out John Davison Rockefeller? John D. was the world's richest man, the world's first billionaire and he came from humble beginnings. John D. also founded and grew Standard Oil, the first true multinational corporation and yet somehow he is not a Giant Of Enterprise?"
5,An historical window on innovation,"Masterfully combines scholarship with fascinating storytelling. No wonder BusinessWeek calls it ""a pleasure to read."""
4,interesting stories,"interesting stories on various historical business leaders from Carnegie, Ford, etc. May be a bit biased."
4,Seems fine to me,We bought two of these at a home and garden show last night. Tried it out of hard Parmesan and a soft cheddar. Both grated easily and you didn't have to push hard(which is why we don't like or other cheese grater). I didn't see these comments until after we bought it but so far I am mystified as to why they are so negative. We always had to cut the cheese up for our other grater too so that didn't seem a big deal. I'll repost if I find anything negative.It also left VERY little cheese left in the bottom of the grater. Unlike our former grater Here is a picture of what we used to use.Zyliss 11370 Classic Rotary-Style Cheese Grater
1,Please don't waste your money like I did,"This is the worst thing I have ever bought. I just doesn't work. You have to push extremely hard for the cheese to grate. Also, you have to cut the cheese pretty small to fit it into the divided cup. After chopping the cheese to fit it in there and breaking a sweat trying to get the thing to grate - it would have been a lot easier to have just used the old fashion grater. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Good for temporary use,I got these because my third lobe piercing is only a couple weeks old and I am having surgery. You can't wear metal for surgery so I was told to look for plastic earrings. The only problem is that pulling them out it tends to pull on the piercing. So for ears that still really haven't healed it hurts a bit taking them out. They are also larger than metal post.
4,Great Monster Story,"I went camping when I was a kid and this was the type of story that we told around the campfire----well, maybe not as violent as this, but the same type of story. And we scared the crap out of each other. Set in Maine, up on Mount Agiochook, two climbers encounter bad weather and amuse themselves with campfire tales. The fun is short-lived when encounter a legendary creature from Indian folklore that turns out to be much more than just a legend and much nastier than any campfire story. Think you know how this story goes? No, actually you don't. It is safe to say that no one is safe from the Mountain King, who is not an unthinking eating machine but is actually an intelligent and sadistic predator on the hunt. Extremely violent and surprising in its plot twists, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I also enjoyed the incorporation of Indian legends into the story and plan on reading Hautala's UNTCIGAHUNK next."
5,I highly recommend this title.,This title is definitely for the horror/monster loving fan. I recommend this at anytime but think it is a great read around that Halloween time of year or maybe on a camping trip. I highly recommend anything by Hautala. If you love King you will absolutely have to own Hautala's books as well.
3,"Almost, but not quite","What happened to character descriptions? What did Mark, Sandy, Phil, and the whole gang look like? No explanation on where these creatures came from, and if they have been there so long why did they go to town only that time? A little more time on a little more details. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the book but there could have been more details to make it more interesting. I think little details make a huge difference in a book. Especially about creatures that could as well been related to humans. How? The ending went by a little fast. I gave the book 3 stars because I was always left wondering after each chapter, but at the end of the book I was still wondering."
3,works good,this is good and priced good. I can see why the more expensive ones are better but if you don't use them all the time this is great.
2,Get it at the grocery store,"Unless you're really impressed with the color green, the filter itself can be picked up at the grocery store. The one around the corner from me was selling them for about $1."
5,One of my favorite books as a child & I STILL love it,"In addition to being entertaining, this book was also informative. Prior to reading it, I didn't even know what a victory garden was! I loved the characters and found them to be realistic and recognizable. Angela was the funniest. I love the stupid names she gave her doll. Traincrack was certainly an original name. Even today I laugh about Traincrack.On a more serious note, I was quite moved when Una/Eunice was reunited with her grandfather. The drawing of them together really touched my heart. It is a book I will never forget and am glad to say I own. (I lucked into this book -- I bought it at a book sale some years ago). This is a classic that should be revived. It is wonderful."
2,waiting,"The costume was to big, I sent it back but have not been credited to my account yetAlso was charged shipping charges and I was not suuposed to from Amazon"
5,Funny,"My three year old laughs and laughs when we read this story, she adds much drama to the achoo, nice book."
2,Kiddo hates sneezes. This did not help.,"If I sneeze my kid cries. It's cute and annoying at the same time since I have allergies and holding in a sneeze hurts. Thought this would help, but anyone reading and even saying Achoo! will make her cry. But that's not why I'm rating it so low. There's really no content."
5,Travel With Elmo!,"Travel with Elmo as he sneezes his way through town! Told in rhyme, the illustrations are vivid and little kids have a lot to look at in each spread!My two year old son loves the EARLY Step Into Readings!"
4,Good for a kid with a cold,Made my son smile when he had a cold so I guess the book has to be a real winner.
2,Mostly Rubbish,"It seems that the frames are sturdy enough. However, the glass is warped and wavy - you can see through it, but everything looks like you are viewing it through a sheet of frozen water. Uncomfortable to look through for more than a couple of minutes."
2,Round Santa Glasses,glasses looked cheaply made with round lens was too bigwas looking for smaller rim glasses for the real Santa look
2,Whoops,"Bought these for a Santa Rampage event in Dallas. The vendor shipped me the wrong ones (got the rectangular ones instead), which I ended up liking alright, but then I forgot them when I went to the Santa Rampage anyway so I guess it doesn't matter that much.Side note, they're pretty small."
4,Give me the (...) ball!,"Excellent fun for both Single and Two players. Extreme violence + sports simulation makes for a good game. A player is bothering you on the court, well, just pull out your well concealed chainsaw and teach him a lesson. Along with all this violence there is a game to play though. You can set yourself up to play in the tournament event and after winning the first championship event you can unlock other teams and so forth. Match time is short, therefore keeping the interest in the game high. Graphics and sound effects are great. RECOMMENDED to those who want a bit more out of their sports game."
4,hot shots golf,"This is a game we played years ago, and I have been trying to find it again. We love it."
5,Very Entertaining,This game is lots of fun! Plenty of levels and hidden players to unlock will keep you playing for a long time.
3,Cute but very little challenge,"This is a very cute game, but does not offer much in the way of challenge. Not bad for younger players, but serious sports gamers will be likely pass."
2,Not Impressed with E-Machines,"One major problem with this computer is that the memory it comes with (128MB) is not quite enough for it to run a graphics heavy operating system like Windows XP. I get very annoying Virtual Memory warnings often and am now looking to buy some more memory for the computer.Also, after two months of ownership, the monitor has blown out. I'm not quite sure what's wrong with it, but the whole situation has left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I have vowed to never purchase e-machines products again.So if you're looking to buy an e-machines computer, more than likely you'll be adding more memory to it down the road. Also keep in mind that it does not come with a CD/DVD drive. In my opinion, you'd most likely be better off purchasing a different brand of computer, even if it is a bit more expensive."
5,Always lucky,"A very humourous look at Stuart Turners life! A great read and well worth buying, but then I am slightly biased, being his younger daughter."
2,more like a toy than a die-cast vehicle,"comparing to older hot wheels scale models, this model car lacks a lot of details. body panels have different colors. front door quarter window is missing."
5,The Miller's Cottage,Beautiful puzzle when completed!!This puzzle was a little hard to build due to all the colors Thomas Kinkade uses in his paintings.. It may take more than one day to build for most people but it is sure worth it afterwards.. Really pretty and would look beautiful framed..
5,My son asks for it.,"We are police officers and though there are no guns available to my child, we thought we could use some help in educating him early. So, at age 4, we got him this video. He loves it and asks for it by name. The tune is catchy and the film is short (5 minutes?)but it makes great points for young and older children alike, without scaring them."
3,Not what we hoped,"We had heard great things about the EDDIE EAGLE products, we bought our son a BB gun and wanted ot teach him about using it safely, guess it was our bad for not researching better, but the 15minute snippet may keep him safe in other situations I suppose. Just not what we we expected."
5,This album is a gem.,"The musicians are excellent technically, each one performs a short solo to show both the beauty and richness of their instrument, as well as their virtuosity. You can clearly see the years of experience they have put in. The riq solo was a treat, considering it's rare to hear a recorded track devoted to that instrument.The repertoire is classical Arabic and Tunisian, all instrumental. I really like the Samai Bayati composed by Slah El Manaa himself. The repertoire is rich in maqams (Arabic scales) and modulations.But most of all the strength of this album is in the arrangement, the delicate balance between instruments, the subtlety, minimalism and attention to detail that is so typical of the Tunisian aesthetic."
4,World Missions,"This book is very good for several reasons, but the greatest reason, is because it helps readers understand missions from a Biblical viewpoint. It helps people become better missionaries, but it also educates the lay person on how to personally be involved in mission work."
3,Book,"Great book but for one class wat to much information to process it is all the place, but if you can take your time it is full of great information."
3,Kindle version is incomplete,"I just recently got this book on Kindle. I've read the first couple of chapters, which are all well and good. The problem I have found is that the book advertises (on the front cover, and even in the preface) that there is a CD attached to the book which contains the full Evangelical Dictionary of World Missions (which costs $40 alone), and a vast assortment of other resources. Of course, this is not actually included. I'm getting on to the publishers to see if I can get the content from them but it's not included here. They really should do something like the Kindle version of the ESV bible translation, where they give you a link where you can download info referred to in the book.I'll update this if I hear anything back from Baker, but otherwise, the hard copy is much better value for money."
5,Part 7 of 9: Great Insights on how a Child's Development should be Incorporated into Parenting Plan,"As a family law attorney you're expected to negotiate parenting plans (custody) every day but of course they don't teach that in law school. This seminar fills in a lot of the gaps for me in terms of children's developmental stages and making sure that the parenting plan you help to negotiate not only results in an agreement, but it's an agreement that will last and that will serve the children. The written materials are offered as a free download on the speaker's web site--all 107 pages of them, which was a huge bonus. Mercer is also the co-author of a well known divorce book, Your Divorce Advisor, along with one of the country's top child psychologists (Marshal Pruett), so she really knows her stuff."
4,Excellent Modern Take on a Classic Shoe,"The pictures on Amazon capture the look and style of this shoe very well. The elongated toe area adds a modern touch to this shoe. It's well made and very comfortable. It's low gloss treatment adds a subdued touch to its modern styling. Surprisingly, it is somewhat wide, but lacing the shoe more tightly solves that problem. The bottom of the show makes it a somewhat casual show, but it goes very well with a suit or dress pants. Kenneth Cole continues to make stylish shoes at a reasonable price. Amazon's price makes it even more enticing."
2,"Good Quality, but smaller then it looks.","I really thought this would be bigger then it turned out to be. Certainly would be good for a single child, but as a parent with a toddler and newborn needed something much bigger. So had to resort to the Double Duo. This one is getting returned."
1,BEWARE! Bad product,"I ordered this product on June 1, 2010 from BestSource Office Supplies. Although the ship time stated 3 to 5 days, it was June 11, 2010 before I received the product from BestSource Office Supplies. The same day that I received the replacement tricolor inkject cartridge and used it in my printer, it did not print-out in the correct colors. I called the company to inform them that their product was defective. It has been a hassle ever since. To this day, July 19, 2010, I still have not received a refund from BestSource Office Supplies. I had to go through Amazon to get a credit."
2,Do not bother,"Unfortunately WinG is really not used any longer and I was actually quite upset after going through the entire book and realizing OpenGL and DirectX/3D are the way to go. Buy a DirectX, Direct 3D or OpenGL book if you want something of value."
3,Old but has some useful techniques,"I originally bought this book back in 1995 when it came out and was very disappointed because I thought I was buying a book that would help me write a 3D raycaster or something similar.It's over a decade later and I'm now trying to find my old copy because I remember it taught some techniques that are horribly outdated today on PCs but might be useful on resource constrained platforms.What this book will do is show you a way of creating a 1st-person-ish 3D-ish view in a tile-based world. It reminds me of the old SSI gold box games, Bards Tale, etc."
5,Does the job nicely,"Cuts things thin in a hurry. Love this processor. We don't use this disk very often because it is so thin. We normally use the 4mm disc, but this one does what it is supposed to do though."
3,Meh...,"I bought this book online because I needed it for a class, and it was cheaper that the schoolbookstore, but when i recieved it, i was a little irritated because the type on all of the pages is crooked, like it was not set properly, and the binding was faulty. I have pages litterally falling out of the book at random. The book itself, as in the text, is fine, its a good refference for analysis of the great gatsby. Its just not a very well made book."
4,beautiful images,THis is a great coffee table book and have had luck with people opening it up and using it as a conversation piece.
4,Great in reducing scalp itch,Living in the northeast I started to develop dandruff and dry scalp. A small amount of this goes along way and it helped to reduce my dandruff problem. This product is great to use during the summer months since it's a lightweight cream. Combining this with an anti-dandruff shampoo eliminated my problem. I used this cream once a week for about 6 to 8 months.
4,Da Summsta's Review,"This book was okay. But I was really bored about the first hundred pages. I was just not that interesting. But, it got better. See, there's supposed to be a murder mystery party at this hotel that a girl is working at. But, when the girl goes into the fake crime scene, she sees a real dead body. Then, out of one hundred people, this girl has to find the culprit before he/she finds her!!!!!! I WOULD SUGGEST ANOTHER BOOK CALLED THE SEANCE. THE AUTHOR IS JOAN LOWREY NIXON. That was such a scary book! I was hooked on the second sentence!!! Man, talk about a page turner!!!!!!!!"
5,This Book IS AWESOME!,"If you read this book you will go wild! I did and i got scared too cause there was actually a real ghost in this book! So check it out and if you don't the book will haunt you. Just Kidding. But read it, it is the most exciting book you have ever read."
3,A Weekend of Murder,I liked the book because it was different from other mysteries in a way. It was original in that the people are trying to solve a fake murder and end up solving a real one. I also liked that they made the ghost a witness and helped solve the murder.I also liked that the ghost found his wife and could finally rest in peace.
1,Scarlett,"I had always wanted to own this movie since I had seen it in 1999 after renting it. I had not been able to locate it on DVD so I was happy when I found it available to purchase, but dissappointed I could only get it on VHS.What I first noticed on the front video sleeve was that it said: ""PROMOTIONAL COPY, NOT FOR SALE OR RENT""During my time watching this movie a warning in lengthy scrolling text kept appearing on the screen & saying that this is ""illegal to own and if you purchased this movie you are instructed to call a one eight hundred number & report it."" It made me feel as though I had done something wrong even though I felt that a purchase made thru Amazon.com would be safe & secure.I am extremely disappointed in my purchase and wondering whether I should call the phone# provided on the video & report this sale. I don't like feeling as if I did something wrong especially made to feel as if I had committed something illegal."
3,All Good Fellows Meet,"An academic meeting is deadly in its own-self. If you've ever attended one you will recognize all the stock characters that are taken from real life.What Emma Fielding didn't expect in Dana Cameron's MORE BITTER THAN DEATH is that the honoree would end up murder and she would join the list of suspects. For a change of pace Ms. Cameron brings out a new/old love interest for Emma if she can solve the murder before becoming a victim.Not as intricate as others in the series, but still a fun read.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
2,ugh,This book couldn't decide what it wanted to be---I got tired of it and gave up 3/4 of the way through.
4,Classic game,Game was easy to find and I received my game quickly and in great condition. Quick and easy process. Thank you!
1,A very bad game,1 xtreme is a very boaring game so if you like exciting games dont buy this one.It doesn't even have good graphics.If youre looking for good graphics buy The game Need for speed 3 high Stakes
4,Works as advertised,So far it works as it should and went right in to the mount holes of the old pump.Its just as noisy and draws as many amps as the old pump.
5,Excellent Book!,"The book is very educational, humourous, and will definately be helpful navigating our frustrating web we call our health care system."
3,"Some advice worked, other advice didn't","There's lots of great advice in here like making sure everyone sanitizes their hands in a hospital, to keeping a sharp eye on all medications administered to prevent errors. But some of the tips didn't seem to pan out.For example, having a candy dish for your nurses and doctors in the hospital sounds good, but in my experience not one single person touched it, maybe to avoid spreading germs. Also, there's great advice on getting second opinions and seeking out specialists on your own. However, all the specialists I found only see new patients based on referrals. It seems to me that the book skipped over this important step... how to get your foot in the door."
4,You the smart patient,This is an essential book for every one to read. We are all patients in the hosspital and need to know the correct questions to ask if we are the patient or being an advocate for a patient. I spent 23 days in the hospital from an appendectimy and toooo many complications. My daughter became my advocate. You need to have one today. I almost died from complications that should never have happened. I was told that I could only bring legal action against the two Dr's if I had perment damage.
2,Geared toward women,"This book is mostly fluff about what to expect at the doctors and how to react to the questions and concerns of your doctor. The test in the beginning of the book talks about various things you should do and not do when going to the hospital. One of the answers is that you should remove your nail polish, another refers to your husband, instead of spouse. Dr. Roiszen is obviously preaching to only the female segment of the patient market. He also mistakenly implies that drug salespersons, known in the trade as ""detail"" salesman, only give him a little token gift and states that they provide a service which he compares to the neighborhood pharmacist. Buy the book of its information, but read it with an open mind."
4,Amusing Book in an Amusing Series,"I didn't realize this was part of a series of books similar to the ""Dummies"" series, complete with cartoons. It does offer some light moments for a patient who is dealing with chronic illness."
4,Patient Advocacy at it's best,"This book is written toward the average layperson and something that has been needed for a long time. As a nurse, I read this book as research. I speak on the topic of patient advocacy and have an independent practice as a case manager. This information (for the most part)is the very information I share with others on a regular basis. For anyone who has ever left the physician's office confused about what they are expected to do next, this book will encourage you to take control of your own health information. I feel that anyone who takes this information to heart will become a smarter patient, one who is in more control of their medical health, and able to save money from unnecessary repeated diagnostic studies and the like. The resources and health history sections are worth the cost of the book."
3,High Expectations Shattered,"Thoroughly disappointed with the first 130 pages (9 chapters), I had to force myself to read them. I wasn't a terrible book but after Ministers with White Collars and Black Secrets, I was definately expecting more from Deborah Smith. The book started to turn around at chapter 10, but then again there are only 15 chapters. Never one to discourage someone from reading, you have to see what happens between Leon and Kiyah.I actually rated this book with 3 1/2 stars."
5,A Page Turner - I need more stars,"This author did not disappoint me. I need more stars. Normally, I don't bother doing reviews on books I've read and I average 5 to 6 a month. But this book took me on a journey that I will never forget and deserving of a review. Kudos to this author, you're talent in storytelling is unparalleled. Keep up the good work, your first book, Ministers With White Collars ect. was good so I read the sequel, Robbed Without a Gun, and didn't expect you to keep up the momentum, I've found that most authors don't. I will be the first person in line for the final book of this series. Please Hurry! I give you 10 stars."
1,Robbed without a Gun,"I feel robbed without a gun. I was expecting a book by the Deborah Smith who wrote Miracle, A Place to Call Home, Blue Willow, etc. Instead I find this book by a Deborah Smith, but not the Smith I was looking forward to reading. This book and her other book Ministers with White Collars and Black Secrets are listed with the other Deborah Smith's books. I feel really cheated! Marilyn Smith, Squaw Valley, CA"
2,Robbed Without a Gun,"This was irritating for her to fallback into cahoots with this ridiculous excuse for a minister. It made her seem, not confused, but greedy to have what somebody else had. This time, she was FULLY aware the man IS MARRIED and a LIAR. Even when she went after the ""cousin"" -- in the CHURCH OFFICE -- okay, that was a bit much. Then, at the end, I couldn't figure out who she was engaged to - Shine or the ""cousin"". Ending was frustrating. I didn't care for this one as much as the Ministers with White Collars and Black Secrets. I thought the author was trying to make the title fit the story. People don't use that phrase -- ""trying to rob me without a gun"" - when someone is trying to climb into their bed. Didn't work as well this time."
2,Good Story - Horrible Editing,"I really enjoyed this book which is a sequel, however, the editing is horrible. The first book was poorly edited as well. I tend to pay attention to grammar usage because of my profession and the author really needs to employ an experienced editor. This will make her novels flow much better. Ms. Smith has the potential to develop her skills and produce a wonderful product. I will purchase her next novel because I believe in her potential as a writer."
5,Great Value,"Recieved mine just a few days after ordering - and I live in Europe! Good quality, good service! Will come back for more parts."
3,Great way of life - marginal reading,"I whole-heartedly agree with ""Tom's"" perspective - not new to ME, but could be of great help to someone looking for that missing something in their life - a very healthy, beautiful way of getting connected with life, the world, and the ""higher power"".The writing on the other hand, put me off. I was somewhat annoyed by ""Grandfather's"" voice in the book - did he really talk like an Indian you'd see in a prehistoric John Wayne movie or was that just for a special 'authentic indian' effect? Obviously Tom can't remember Grandfather's stories word for word so I have to wonder why Tom chose to portray Grandfather this way (perhaps he really did talk this way! ). Also, towards the end of this short book there was a ""broken record effect"". I started getting the feeling the publisher requested a specific number of pages and Tom ran out of things to say long before he reached that number! A bit annoying... sorry Tom (and Tom fans) - but this was my experience with the book!"
5,Greater understanding,"I read this book many years ago and it opened my eyes and heart to a broader understanding of Native American history and way of life. I had both my children read the Tracker to aid in their understanding, as this book was too spiritual for them at the time. I found it a fascinating read and began to consider that some of the events he describes--like the dead talking to the living--may actually be real. Today this sounds more believable than not, but years ago this book really helped me on my journey. Thanks, Tom and Grandfather."
2,Not Bad/Not Great,"A friend had recommended this to me but I have not finished it yet (and have moved on to other books) as it is just too redundant and hitting the same points over and over. I like the idea, and I usually would want to finish a book before rating it, but just don't have the drive. I definitely do like what it talks about though, and like the ideas. Hopefully will finish some day."
3,"Good Topic, Poorly Written","This book has something to offer in terms of topic, however I found the writing style disjointed. The author oscilates at a frustrating pace between the artistic style of a journal entry, and that of a reporter. She would have served the readers better by sticking to reporting on her findings of the Stasi and the implications of the existance of the former security state on current german society. I came to the book following the promise of a good report on the Stasi, and instead found myself bored with the useless tangents about the author feeling lonely, not being able to figure out her odd relationship with her roommate, etc. Still worth reading, but be prepared to gloss over much petty information."
5,Life behind the Iron Curtain,"An interesting and talented writer, individual stories of people from the former East Germany. A non fiction story of life with Stasi....after the writers immersion in East Germany during several months. It begins rather cautiously and in a rather bland fashion and gets more and more poignant and tragic and shocking even for me who knows life in a Communist country at first hand.The originality of the book is the fact that the writer interviewed both people that suffered and had their lives destroyed by the system and people responsible for it, always with a journalists care for giving all of them the opportunity to give their version. This is a book that should be read by all those that think that the Communist utopia is still attractive. Surely no utopia that needs so drastic and inhumane means to deny reality is worth to survive."
5,"First-person journalism, first-rate read","""Stasiland"" delivers. Australian author Anna Funder weaves a fabric of East German state repression via a half-dozen or so short stories, victims and perpetrators of ""Stasi-style"" socialism.Her uncanny ability to find these individuals and ferret out their tales is her talent. Leipzig and East Berlin are her haunts. Using chance-encounters, pub evenings, friend-of-a-friend associations and newspaper advertisments, she manages to come up with Julia, Miriam, Frau Paul and Hagen Koch, along with an odd assortment of ex-Stasi officials, mostly small fish but a couple of big ones.In terms of readability, ""Stasiland"" is something like Edgar Allen Poe's ""Short Stories,"" where each story stands alone but when webbed together makes for a powerful and coherent anthology. The total is greater than the sum of the parts.""The Lives of Others"" is the movie equivalent for depicting life in East Germany under the Stasi. Five stars for ""Stasiland."""
5,Nailed It,"I was in Berlin in 1961 when the wall went up. I also travelled extensively in East Berlin and East Germany when the wall was in existence. I know these stories about the Stassi to be true. Very well done, Anna!"
3,Some astute observations of people involved,"I liked the interviews with past members of Stasi - their openess, their regrets, their excuses.Anna did a great job tracking them down & being able to talk with them & capture a part of German history.I didn't really enjoy the blow by blow description of the author's ordinary life between interviews."
5,Stasiland - A View Across the Wall,"Having lived in Germany during much of the time that the country was divided by the wall between the societies of West and East Germany, I was very impressed and further educated by this excellent work of investigative journalism. What amazed me most was that it was written by a very informed ""Auslaenderin."" She knew the country, the cities of Berlin and Leipzig, and more importantly, she could tap into the moods, the mentalities, and the life-defining experiences of those whose stories she shared with us. I can only marvel at this sensitive view into a dark time in Germany's Post WWII history. It's really a shame that one cannot rate a work of this caliber with six stars. Read it."
5,The Ossis through an Aussie's Eyes,"Australian born Ann Funder writes of the Ossis--former victims or members of the Stasi, the GDR's secret police. At once chilling and sentimental, this non-fiction reads so smoothly and beautifully it feels like fiction. Like the Puzzle People reconstructing fragments of the Stasi's formerly secret files, Funder pieces together a puzzle of history of which many know nothing.Many others wish to forget, but through the study of history we learn lessons--what works, what doesn't. In 2000, she interviewed the Puzzle People in Nuremberg.""'The mistake the GDR made was to force people into a position,' the dark man says, 'either you are for us or an enemy.'""Sound familiar?"
2,Stasi Cosmo mag articles,"Don't get me wrong the book is definitely worth reading, but by the time I got to the chapter called ""The Italian Boyfriend"" I was starting to skip sentences looking for something other than what appeared to be female chit-chat. At this point I'm in chapter ten and I know more about some woman named Julia than the Stasi, it seems by this time the only thing I don't know about her is the color of her underwear, but I don't know all that much about the Stasi. By all means buy and read the book but be prepared to have to sift through a lot of stuff that will make you think you're reading an article from Cosmo magazine."
5,Beautiful,"Wow -- I had never heard of this group before I heard one of their songs (""Danger"") in a video game of all things. I hunted them down, bought the album, and fell in love. I've seen other reviews call this reminiscent of Sade, which I guess it is, but what it reminds me of most is neo-soul with a dash of new age. The lead singer's voice is an incredible instrument. Going to recommend it to all my artsy video gaming friends. =)"
5,beautiful vocals with great triphop/dnb/jazz beats,"Right when I heard this I fell in love. Singer is very similar with Esthero, but more subtle, and sweeter, and the beats are more intimate. Actually a lot of the music is very Esthero-esque. If you like Esthero you will love Etro Anime. Highly recommended."
4,BIrthday party,Worked great for our football fan's birthday party last year. Can't say I have much to complain about in this transaction.
4,satisfied customer,"I was pleased with the simplicity & ease of ordering and the speed of my delivery,even though it was the height of the holiday season.I would'nt hesitate to shop with you guys in the future,thanks!"
3,Very interesting,"The production quality of the video is very poor. Given the guest in this video, one would expect more of a professional interview in a more attractive and suitable location (flies buzzing David's face during the interview? come on!!). However, if you can overlook the terrible quality, which is due to the incompetence of the video crew and editor, and focus on the speaker, David Adair's story is incredible. He has enough proof to back up his story, and there's no reason, NO REASON, whatsoever, for a man of his intellect to make up a story like this, which would do nothing but harm his reputation. I believe him."
1,David Adair Questionable Background,"Based on Stanton Friedman who knows more about Nuclear Technology than most individuals, it seems quite certain that Adair's fusion rocket would have difficulty operating in the earth's atmosphere. I believe that Adair's story makes for great science fiction, but that is all."
5,EBM!,"I love The Plastic Noise Experience's music, specially the song Memory flowand Kill The 6. I Recommended this album."
2,Too much hype spoils the reading,"Believe me, I love Cory Doctorow. I follow his blog, get his newsletter, and have read very good short stories written by him. That's why I expected more from this novel.Its strong points are the ideas: the concept of Tribe, the focus on User Interface, the ubiquity of the comm, the use of language. But it has weak points, and the main one is the plot, which is quite conventional, using plot devices straight out of Creative Writing 101: starting 'in media res', 'deus ex machina' for solving the 'someone flew over the cuckoo's nest'/'catch 22' problem, overheard conversations, dialogue for background...However, I think this book is a promising second book of somebody that, in the future, will become an excellent writer. Maybe it's worth reading just for the 'I discovered him first' value."
2,Disappointed,"I just finished EST, and I'm still not sure what I read. The storyline seems as if it isn't fully developed, as are the characters, the story ends abruptly, and the whole book feels rushed and too short. As I read, I kept waiting to be 'hooked' by the story (which had potential), but I wasn't. Perhaps the book was oversold to me- I've heard great things about Mr. Doctorow's writing. Several other reviewers here mention that this isn't his best work and that readers who haven't yet read any of his books should start with something else. I have to agree."
4,"fast-paced, light, leaves you wanting more","The book is the story of Art, a member of the Eastern Standard Tribe living and working in London for Virgin/Deutsche Telekom, where he designs user interfaces for new products. The book jumps back and forth between two timelines, a later one where Art is atop a mental institution to which he's been committed, and an earlier one where he's found a new girlfriend, Linda, after hitting her with his car. The book progresses quickly until the timelines meet and everything is wrapped up.It's a very quick read, and I agree with reviewers who found it to be too short and superficial. But despite its lightness, it is an extremely entertaining book, and contains numerous interesting ideas which are worthy of fuller development in both reality and fiction."
2,Slightly Better Than DAOITMK...,"...but not a whole lot. I wrote a poor review of this book already, just a day after the book came out - it was able to download and read it from his site - and strangely enough, my review was not published here. Maybe Amazon edits out the bad reviews to increase sales?Anyways, this book was slightly better, mostly because there are no more Disney rantings as in DAOITMK. It has a slightly better plot and more in-depth character development. I'd recommend downloading and reading it first before buying. An improvement for sure."
2,Not as good as it should have been,"Just a mild disappointment after reading Down and Out at the Magic Kingdom. Many of the same ideas are here, online affinity groups, peer moderation, and creeping insanity."
2,Cute doesn't a novel write,"Doctorow is a good writer. If you're familiar with Boing Boing, you'll probably know him as a writer and editor there and I've certainly enjoyed what he had to say in that forum and other online ones.However I feel suckered when I laid out $13 to read this piece of fluff that's masquerading as a novel. The characters are extremely weak and the plot just drifts along without coming to any sort of solid conclusion. The ideas behind the book are interesting but I just don't think they're worth reading about in a novel that's as uncompelling as this one. You can see where he's taken current trends in how technology is shaping society and twists them to an absurdist end, but at best they're material a cute little 'gee wiz' short story, not a full novel.I'd stick to boing boing and skip this one."
1,don't ever try to cancel your order with this service group,"i had ordered a flat panel tv but found after placing the order that i would not receive the product in time. i received my cancellation email for the television but not the service contract i purchased at the same time.the company that provides the extended protection warranties was unable to cancel my order and provide a refund in a timely manner, specifically 8 weeks. they also do not have a direct contact number to speak to a representative who can explain or handle the situation. the service of service company amazon has chosen to work with is unacceptable."
4,pixel lines,"Samsung 52"" LCD HDTV Within 3 months of use a 3 inch pixel line appeared. Very disappointed."
3,The body milk was thinner than what I had purchased in department stores,"The fragrance did not last and I would not purchase it again. The discription on the purchase was ""Lait Douceur Sensuel' and previous purchases were ""Sunsual Softness Body Milk"" and Lait Douceur Sensuel. I suppose the packaging has changed."
5,Works!,I bought this to remove rust/mineral stains in the toilet. I tried everything else on the market and this was the only thing that removed the stain. I am not sure if it was gone for ever because we moved but it kept the stain away for six months! I will buy this again and recommend this!
2,Don't waste your money,Just a plain old pumice stone. I think it might even be softer than the ones i can buy at the grocery store. It fell apart the first time i used it. hardly worth the money.
5,Awesome Product,"This little stone did the trick on the hard water build up around my bathroom sink fixtures. I also used it on my shower tile which has a rough surface. This did cause it to erode much more quickly then when used on smooth surfaces, however it also managed to remove some buildup I had from another cleanser that NOTHING else worked on. I love this little stone and I have already ordered some for my kitchen!"
5,The search has ended!,"I've been looking for an item that would remove hard water stains from my toilet bowls for four years, ever since I moved into my house. This is finally the solution! I'm so excited. I've told neighbors who have the same problem and highly recommended that they buy this too!"
4,T2200 is a good value,"I wasn't expecting anything exciting for the price, despite the high-end features, and was pleasantly surpised. I'm very pleased with the T2200's performance. Althought I'm not a serious gamer, games like Rainbow Six and Myst III Exile perform noticably smoother than my 1.1 Ghz HP. I like the big hard drive, having readily filled the 60 Gb on my previous system. I was also pleased not to have to pay extra to get 1394 to transfer movies and photoes from my digital camcorder.I did find a couple of cost cuts in the design irksome, and I'd have spent a little more up front to get them. The nice multi-media keyboard and other high-end features deserves a more high-end mouse, say an optical mouse. And I'd liked to have found more function and flexibility to write to the CD-RW than just Windows XP. I'm adding third-party CD-RW software to my system."
2,For this price you can do better,"By cutting down on things you don't really need like a 100GB hard disk drive, you can (at this price) get things you do need like good graphics.Overall this machine has decent features. The AMD 1.8GHz CPU (the model number is 2200 but don't be fooled) is adequate for most users (though it does lack SSE-2, something that will hurt down the line) and it has plenty of ram and very large hard disk (something I don't really endorse right now considering the very high return volume on 100GB+ hard disk drives).The main weakness is the graphics: the S3 ProSavage8 is a very old chipset architecture that won't play any recent 3D games (at quality levels worth playing). [I should note that Amazon incorrectly states it has Intel Extreme Graphics which are much better, though not high on my list.]E-machines offers better computers that this, and so do it's competitors. I would keep looking."
4,I quite liked it!,"Having just read (well, actually listened to the audiobook) the original War of the Worlds, and also just seeing the recent movie, I was looking for another take on this story. I liked this version of bringing the story into modern times, although it is of course, USA-centric.It was certainly a decent way to pass Memorial Day weekend, reading this!"
3,War of the Worlds: New Millenium,"I enjoyed this re-telling of the Wells classic. Niles does a good job of bringing the story up to present time. I have to confess that I am a bit of a ""War of the Worlds"" junky so this book was right up my alley."
4,dang good. but could have been better,"well i am not going to into the details of the story. i think by the time you get to me you have pretty decent idea of what happens.. itsa much easyer, and interetsing read then the original, doubtless to it being modernised.. the military aspects are very real, bravery courage, even against a seeminly unbeatable enemy, and i am not just talking the US but around the world. the only real problem i had.. was the machines.. they seemed so...clumsy. remeber the movies form the 50's... those were amazing, and still some of the most alien machines i have seen in any movie. i think with a bit more imagination he could have though of something and bit.. well. cooler. but over all. i coudlnt put the book down... just ask my boss :)"
1,Dismal and cynical offering,"This is a 333 page novel. The Martians make their appearance around page 189 or 190. This gives some idea of how serious the author is about his subject. Most of the book is a re-hash of Niven and Pournelle's Footfall, in other words, Tom Clancy with a light science fiction coating. This is not a tale well told; it is a slick job of marketing. Niles needs to stick to World War II what-ifs."
4,Better than average rewrite,This book is basically the original H.G. Wells novel brought into the 21st century. Evidently the US Mars probes have upset the Martian population and they to earth for a little revenge. The story pretty much follows the original except for a slight twist of the ending which I won't reveal. It is a pretty good story but could have been longer with more fleshing out of the characters who are pretty flat and predictable. It is a fairly quick read with lots of action.
5,better than ever,"It was hard to put this book down, even when I could only keep one eye open late into night.Doug Niles brings the horror of the famous Martian invasion story into the 21st century. You share in the passion of the main characters as they battle angrily, and hopelessly, against the Martian attack. How can our planet survive this new invasion when our most potent and modern weapons are rendered inoperable by a far superior force? Led by a brave few, with only their hearts and minds left to battle the gruesome creatures, you'll find out if the expression ""where there's a will, there's a way"" once again holds true.Another gripping tale that stands up to the original - a must read!"
1,poorly made,"Bought one of these for an Olds Bravada, didnt look at it till my old cracked one got pretty loud. When I check the new one out!!!!! I could have done a better job building a flywheel in my garage. One of the welds did not hit the plate and ring gear, and the plate was welded in crooked! Can you say Piece of junk!!!"
4,Decameron review,Very pleased with the book. It provides a look at life and humor from another time.The product itself is very concise and an easy read.
1,Unfortunate Whitewash,"In attempting to set the record straight about Pope Pius Xll, Dalin writes an unfortunate revisionist whitewash in support of the Catholic Church.Rabbi Dalin's attempt to be contemptuous of his fellow authors backfires on him. His self-righteous anger at anyone who would condemn the Catholic Church is misplaced. Pity that he does not stick to the topic of the Pope (about whom he seems to make some good arguments) and leave it at that. Instead, he attempts to besmirch those who justifiably have criticised Catholicism.The facts of history are clear. Catholicism itself is in large part responsible for anti-Semitism and shame on any Jew, let alone a rabbi (and himself the son of a Rabbi) who would do anything to whitewash the truth of history itself."
1,Nice Propaganda,The catholic church and the Vatican have been fooling people for centuries with their propaganda and this is another attempt. Nice Job....
4,Insightful,"I found this book useful in balancing the media's portrayal of the Vatican as a hideout for Nazis during WWII.Rabbi Dalin's account of how the Catholics, in particular Pius XII, were instrumental in saving many Jews from extermination by the Nazis in WWII is eye-opening and apparently well-researched (haven't got the time to check!). Despite a bias towards a Catholic-Jew alliance versus the Grand Mufti, the book is definitely worth reading. It is thought-provoking and shows the different perpectives that history can take."
4,Pope Pius 12 freed,Dalin truly does his research from the vatican archives to the offical transcripts and letters from the 1950s that exeorate Pope Pius the 12. He goes into previous books and of claims about Pius serving Hitler and takes them apart line by line picture by picture. On top of it there is full evidence to back his claims as well as takes apart a photograph taken before world war 2 and how it was photoshoped to support the damming evidence Pius. Its a short read with amazing detailed which is backed up by mounds of evidence. Of letters and historical evidence including letters from the newly establish state of israel that credit pius for saving thousands of lives.This pope was truly a man God appointed in the darkest hour. Good read.
5,The real story behind the support by the Catholic Chruch and its Pope in WOII to the Jewish Community,"A historical overview written by open minded Jewish scholars in the USA.A well founded and documented story, which -maybe better than any other publcation-, shows the malevolent falsifications in the 1964 book 'The Stellvertreter' ('The Deputy') by Rolf Hochhuth (and in the movie) .The book also illustrates the common roots of Catholics and Jews, who are linked in their common Judeo-Christan culture.."
5,Well...,"Well at first I was skeptical about these clubs, but now that I think things through this is a really good product. They are very solidly made and are worth the price, they are even nice if you accidentally buy only one club."
5,Six Stories,This volume contains 6 Jack London stories:1. The Scarlet Plague - the year 20732. The Dream of Debs - speculation of what would be the effect of a General Strike3. The Shadow and the Flash - possibilities of invisibility4. The Unparalleled Invasion - bacteriological warfare5. The Heathen - a hurricane6. The Mexican - a revolutionary prize-fighter
3,Be careful with this...,"I bought one of these, while it's great as a lanyard, don't try and charge the ipod with the case on because you'll have a hard time removing the cord when complete."
2,Good Title...poor book,"I really wish this book did not have so many grammatical errors because I believe people need to simplify their life, but this book insults the reader's intelligence. If a well-respected author like Jack Trout is going to attach his name to a piece of writing he should make sure it is readable. In addition, this book seems to be choppy in its central theme. I do not remember the authors addressing the idea of simplicity throughout the whole book. The central concept was lost somewhere among Jack Trout's tirades to the business professional."
4,Recommendation,"I would definitely recommend this book to people. It is an excellent book and it has a lot of information that someone could apply in many ways. Someone could apply it to more than just the marketing in an organization; they could apply it to other areas in the organization, their own career advancement, and their life in general. Of course, this book does repeat a lot of the things that Jack Trout talks about in his other books, but this is still well worth reading. Even if you are familiar with his work, it never hurts to be reminded, and there are still many new things you can learn. Even if you do not agree with every point he makes, there are many lessons to be learned from this book that can be applied in multiple aspects."
4,Great if you run the company,"If you own your own company or are truly in charge, I'd suggest reading this book. I think you'll agree with the authors that sometimes we overcomplicate things so much in pursuit of the golden nugget of data that we really had a much better process when we first started.If you don't have significant influence over your company's (or department's) management, strategy and culture, you'll most likely find yourself just plain frustrated that ""management"" can't see the obvious.Trout is a great author and a wonderful thinker. The world's business leaders would be doing themselves a huge favor to think and plan more like him."
1,Cut and paste - and not a very good job at that,"I recently purchased The Power of Simplicity by Jack Trout. This book's lack of originality is not my complaint. By page 70 I had bumped into enough interruptions from grammatical and printing errors that the book was quickly relegated to the ""don't suggest"" shelf of the de Francesca library. It is surprising to find so many mistakes in the printed text, given that so much of this book' s content was cut from earlier works by Mr. Trout and other writers.I would expect, and accept, this as a draft from a college student. I do not accept it from a reputable organization such as McGraw-Hill and under the name of Mr. Jack Trout who has been part of high quality writing projects in the past."
4,Grizzly Park is a great Bear Scary Movie.,"I've watched Grizzly Park several times and it's just as bloody & scary as the first time I saw it. Makes you very weary of ever wanting to meet a bear up close or at a distance. And it's very informative of what not to do when you're in bear country. So, enjoy the scares and heed the lessons."
1,Worst movie ever... seriously.,"If you want a good laugh, this is the movie for you. Wow, just wow. This should be under comedy, not horror, cuz I laughed hysterically all the way through it. The bear was, hands down, THE best actor. No joke."
1,Failed Film,"Avoid this at all costs, its terrible on every single level from acting, to writing, to the sound, technical disaster and had to fast forward most of the movie. Full Avoidance."
2,Never expected a tame grizzy...,"All dead in Grizzly park: a special death sentence misdemeanorstroll in the park.The movie is lot of blood and gore and attacks by wolves and a big bear.These city kids think they are getting over, but when they and anescaped felon become bear food,the outlook changes?I don't call this entertainment."
1,Ecch!,"The bear does his best to bring the acting level up to something nearly acceptable. There is a girl in this movie that thinks a skunk is some kind of ""forest kitty."" HA! It is to laugh. Unfortunately, the group is sprayed by forest kitty and she said she did not know. That is all the spoiler I will provide. The ending has a twist but overall, if I could give this movie a zero, I most certainly would."
2,;0/,It's your typical low budget movie. My expectation wasn't High so it wasn't a let down. It's great to watch if you want to kill time other than that not too much to say. Special effects was bad.
1,Better off watching the Discovery channel...,"Here is the plot. A bunch of young adult criminal offenders are court ordered to hike through the woods and have a go of roughing it in the woods. They are watched closely by an escaped mute serial killer and a grumpy grizzly bear. Doesn't sound too bad right? Well, the serial killer is killed by the bear before the movie even gets going. So, the rest of the movie is just a buch of very unlikable twentysomethings walking around the woods while a hungry bear is looking for berries. Not much happens at all until the bear decides the berries aren't filling his belly and he eats the annoying bad actors who are pretending to be annoying criminals.I prefer the discovery channel or if you like real grizzly bears, rent Grizzly Man..."
1,"Zero, zero, zero star!","I think it is our, Amazon members',communal responsibility in Amazon to warn other hapless horror aficionados to steer away from this stinking pile of disaster. You miserably watch pitiful actors for one hour only to see almost all of them torn to pieces back to back in five or six minutes, which is actually a relief.The bear is simply the star of the movie and is believable and horrifying; other than that avoid AT ALL COSTS.I very much regret for the wasted 91 minutes of my life."
3,"good, but needs work","In my opinion, The movie is good, but it needs alot of work. I do get the story idea, but it doesn't make alot of sense. The Special effects, some of them are just not believeable. ""The Walking Dead"" had alot more believeable effects on their shows than ""Grizzly Park"". But there are some funny moments in this movie. I did like the twist and turns like the serial killer being there and the kids emotions toward each other, but it doesn't have the same feeling as movies like ""The Ruins"", and ""I Am Legend"".If they had changed the storyline just a little bit, maybe they would have a better rating.Grizzly ParkSo In Conclusion, This movie is good, but not great. I am just writing how i feel ,but you have to see it for yourself."
3,Grizzly Park,"I don't think the critics get it. This is a dark comedy. Sometimes critics don't get dark comedies, and I think that is the case here because I found it fun to watch. A group of teenagers must go on a park cleanup to repay for their crimes ranging from computer hacking to manslaughter. Who would guess a murderer is posing as one of the park staff and killing off people. If that isn't bad enough there is a killer grizzly bear rampaging through the park. The cast does a pretty good job and their are a couple you should recognize. The writing and directing are good. The story is different and original. The special effects and the editing are fairly decent. At least rent it like I did, and if you enjoy dark comedies I think you will like it. If you enjoyed this, catchBlack Sheep (Unrated).CA Luster"
1,"Stanley Thermos, 1/2 Qt Black","Stanley Thermos ""Thermos"" is a misnomer. A vessel for liquid is more accurate. After an hour, my Stanley Thermos, 1/2 Qt, doesn't keep liquid any hotter than an open ceramic cup that I placed next to it. I have a 1 quart Stanley thermos, I bought in the early 70's. Unopened that thermos, after 24 hours, keeps coffee just as hot as when I put it in. This one does not."
1,There is a better DVD,"Although this DVD is okay, for a more entertaining and interesting documentary, look for the film, Geocache by David Liban. It's been on PBS and has been awarded at several film festivals."
4,useful and concise,Very useful analysis of American Literary Theory. Gives a good overview of recent thoretical thought in the United States. The author places each critic's position within the wider frame of 20th c. critcal thought. If I have a fault with the book it is that he does not include more theorists in his analisis. His style is clear and concise. I hope for more titles from this author.
1,Not What I Expected,I exected a girdle with some material to it. This was the cheapest looking girdle I have ever seen. I'm sorry but I was rather disappointed in it.
5,this album is a pure and sincere look at the belizean music,"The rhythm is original, and the drums alive with feelings. the punta is the number one dance of Belizean. a cultural mixture of african, mayan and spanish mix.It has no bounderies and no colour Andy does his best and it is a pleasure to listen and the pride of his country shows. i would recommend this and any of his music.christine sanchez"
3,Decent game...not as good as others,"This game is fun to play for about the first week..after that you begin to be angered by the lack of character selection and moves that you can use. It is an English version of a Japanese Wrestling game, which would explain the use of some moves that are very rarely used in America. I would reccomend this game for a cheap thrill for a little while. But, beyond that..the game is nothing special. Go out and get a copy of Smackdown or any Japanese Import."
3,Okay for light work and gardening.,"This shower is lightweight and easy to carry around to shower either plants or myself. However, the plastic connectors are not exactly water tight, and the shutoff never really shuts it off completely."
3,my husband love it,"My husband was looking for an outdoor shower, so the kids could use it before getting in the jaccuzzi. Is perfect, doesn't need special arrangements. Good price too."
1,disappointed,"I ordered two cans of this Connolly Hide Care a week ago since I got a small appliance that has Connolly leather. I figured I can't go wrong with their own leather care, but boy was I wrong!!!!!!!! This product is very very thick, and it gets into small holes/cracks and stay there, very ugly looking. it is very difficult to apply evenly because of its thickness. It smell not bad, but sure not good.I highly recommend Zano leather care products. Do a onlie search for it. It is a small specialized shop focusing on auto care products. Their Leather care is HEAVENLY, very thin and easy to apply, and smells GREAT!"
2,Not the real stuff...,"Back when, Connolly hide food was ""the"" leather conditioner. It was recommended by Jaguar, Rolls Royce, Bentley etc. It used to be made of cattle by-products, so really did contain the stuff that makes leather soft, and avoids drying out - albeit at an animally-type smell! I've brought back many a rough looking leather car interior with this hide food.But no more. The latest jar I purchased had all those ingredients gone. Now it's just the boring lanolin-based hide food - which is really not that wonderful.I'd certainly say this was not worth it's premium price."
1,not good,I tried out a small spot on my front seat and it faded the black leather in my Cadillac. I had to bring back the supple shine with a cheap leather wipe.
4,Great Set of Basic Recipes,"This book is a great example of a useful asian recipe collection. The best aspect of the book is the fact that all of the recipes are well illustrated. Not only is the food itself illustrated, but all the preparation steps are also illustrated making the cooking process very easy. A large number of diverse recipes are included that provide a nice sample of asian cusine. The only disappointment I found was that each recipe stands alone. The recipes are grouped according to type (soups, meat and poultry, etc), but we aren't given any background for any of the dishes; for some we don't even know what country they come from. Still the recipes are all interesting, and easy to make. If all you need is a set of great ideas for asian meals, you'll find this book invaluable. If you're looking for the cultural background for dishes, you'll have to look elsewhere."
2,Wait What?,The story line is forced and the movie is hardly about what it claims to be. Cant say say i was 100% disapointed because i was intrigued by some parts of it. The lead is an interesting actress just wish she had more of a plot to play with.
2,Lucky to get 2 stars,"Obviously I'm getting old, I can't see how this could appeal to anyone over 30!!"
5,Excellent story of how love can hit you more than once.,"A woman learns to love after loosing the love of her life (her husband) to lukemia. She fights her feelings of second love, until she realizes that love and life go on after death."
1,Volksmarsch CD,This is of very poor quality. The performer is fine but the instrumentation sounds fake and the overall audio sounds muffled. I have returned it for credit which is pending.
2,The Never Ending Story ...Pt XXXVII,"Written partly through the eyes of Helen herself (I assume ?), this story takes the reader on a ride through life, living in Melbourne Australia during the 1970's. It presents the life of a girl and her infatuation with a drug induced loser. Throughout the entire book, I found myself just waiting for her to come to her senses, and get her life back on track. Unfortunately .. as is life I guess, she never does and the book just ends, like it began with no real conclusions. It left me personally with a feeling of utter frustration."
5,"NHL Powerplay ""96""","NHL powerplay is an awesome game it makes you feel like you are really playing hockey! It's easy to learn but a real challange.Ratings:[1-5]Graphics:3.5[great for a 96 game]Fun:5[good entertainment for a long rainy day]Sound/Music:4[good beat]Overall:4.5[good for a first hockey game]P.S:I got this for [price],definitely got my moneys worth.['_']"
2,I'm dissapointed,"The sweater is a generic cable knit sweater, which is fine. I was not expecting high end tailoring. But I was expecting it to be soft.The lable says 100% Cashmere as does this web page. I own numerous cashmere items. None of them are scratchy. This one is. I'm not saying they are selling other wool as cashmere, but... I do have a merino wool sweater that has a similar level of softness. There is a hint of cashemere-like softness to this garment, but there is another scratchy note, such as you might find in a blend.I'm dissapointed."
3,I guess it will make things shine,"I should have paid more attention to the labeling, it is a polish cream, not a metal cleaner. If you just want to shine something up a little, this might be fine. But it does nothing for the metal things I need to polish, such as an antique bread dough maker or hand-cranked ice cream maker."
5,GREAT STUFF HERE,I use this to polish our car rims and it gives great results! I even showed a friend the rims after polished and he really loved it and now wants to buy this metal polisher! When I detail my car I only want to use the best things out there and nothing less.
5,Silver & Gold,"Yes, this works great on both silver & gold. In fact, it is by far the best silver polish I've ever used, it puts all the others to shame. I used a microfiber rag to apply the BlueMagic. Then for a perfect polish use a nice cotton rag. With the silicone finish built into the formula you will be protected from the elements for a while. I've used it already on all my cuff links, gold Tiffany wedding band, and a bunch of brass candle sticks.There's really not much to say, other then this will give you WOW results, especially on Silver & Bras."
1,unhappy with quality,"This book's binding was broken and in general the book was not in good condition. Neither Amazon or the company who sent the book responded to my complaint.I was also very disappointed with the gift wrapping on the 5 presents from Amazon that were sent to my daughter for Christmas. Three were not wrapped, merely in blue boxes with a small ribbon taped to the box. Two others were actually gift wrapped but using such poor quality paper that they arrived with the wrapping torn open. This was NOT free wrapping, I paid $18.00 for it. NEVER, NEVER PAY AMAZON FOR GIFT WRAPPING. I was terribly disappointed when I arrived on Christmas day and had to re-wrap the five presents. It has certainly tainted my opinion of Amazon.I run my own business and I can tell you that attention to details, both large and small is a direct reflection on how a company is managed and their corporate ethic."
1,AVOID the Kindle Edition!,"The one star is specifically for the Kindle edition. This is probably a good book, but the Kindle edition does it no justice whatsoever; double-page spreads are chopped in two, captions refer to photos that you must click forward or back to see. It's maddening, and ruins the appearance that the authors surely intended. In future, I will avoid Kindle editions of photo books."
2,Stopped working,I sent this as a gift more than two years ago. The gift receiver told me that it had stopped working. Maybe I shouldn't expect it to always work?
4,Polder Upscale Chicken Timer (Red),"I bought this timer as a time management tool, as opposed to needing it for the kitchen. I keep it on my desk at work. It works just fine! You do have to turn the timer all the way to 60 minutes and then turn it back to however many minutes you want to set it to, but it's not inconvenient. The red chicken is really cute; it's plastic, yes, but that fact is clearly stated in the product description. The chicken's silver comb is fine. I really like this timer and am pleased so far with it."
1,timer,Does not work well at all. Very short and soft alarm. Can not hear it unless you are right next to it.
1,Bad Chicken,"I was excited about getting a cute timer that worked with the decor of my kitchen. Unfortunately, the timer never worked on the product! Now I am sad!"
5,Love my chicken,"Not sure why others have had issues (maybe some defects; maybe some user errors?), mine works perfectly every time! Not to mention that it look great too. Yes, it's plastic. What do you expect for the price? I've been using it almost daily for six months with no issue. Of course, if you don't use it properly it won't ring, or only ring momentarily, or you may break it completely. You should never turn it in the wrong direction; doing so will break the mechanics. You MUST turn it completely over to 60, then back to the time you want. The directions stated this clearly. If you do that you will get a nice, loud ring. It won't ring forever and you won't hear it outside, but if you're in a nearby room or just doing other things in the kitchen it's more than loud enough. Overall I love it and I'm glad I went ahead with the purchase despite the negative reviews."
1,Stopped working after 1 day,"Do not buy this item. It stopped woking for us after 1 day (well, a few hours, actually) of use. Now I'm stuck with a useless thing because it's beyond the 30-day return policy....."
3,"Looks cute, cheap plastic",I didn't expect much for the $5 I paid for this timer but when it arrived I was actually surprised by how light and cheap it feels in my hands. It doesn't feel like it will hold up over time.
3,Has all information...needs reformatting and editing,"One thing that I have found with the kindle text is that the electronic formatting often displays words disjointed. For example, a word within a sentence may look something like th-is or perhaps even something like this.(Spacing for example)Wouldn't mind having more notes within the text (much better than end notes)."
5,"""Peter Greens""","The title it self tells you it ""Peter Greens"" Fleetwood Mac. So if your looking for Stevie/Lindsey Fleetwood Mac, just look under Fleetwood Mac. There is nothing misleading with this title. Peter Green, is one of the Greatest guitariest, songwrites of all times. He has a legacy of being a Blues Master, and has left his mark in history.I think ""Need Your Love So Bad"", is one best songs he ever wrote. See if you can listen to, Gary Moore doing an album called ""Songs for Greenie"" where he does his version of Peter Green songs, that will blow you away, which by the way was recorded using the same Les Paul guitar that Peter use to record the orginals."
3,How is this Essential?,"How is this Essential Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac when ""Oh Well"", ""Green Manalishi"", ""Coming Your Way"", ""Rattlesnake Shake"" are not included? It's a Travesty..."
3,A Great Book (for the first half),"Excellent book, well written, easily read, fascinating with insight and novel observation into shamanism, western culture and the tradition of the Incas. I couldn't put it down until I came to the second half of the book. As mentioned by some of the reviews above the author digresses into his own life a bit too much after his stellar writing with his initial journeys into Peru.I still recommend this book but I was disappointed with how it's impact trailed off as if the author became less apt in his ability to concentrate on what the book was for, the discovery of Incan Shamanism, a new way of thought and insight into the meaning of life and our purpose on earth or an auto-biography of an American Psychologist? I really wish this book could be re-written."
2,Will the real Inca Medicine practitioner stand up!,"I took classes by Villoldo's students. After two years of learning a tradition called Inca, I found out I was learning medicine techniques that had no origin in South American shamanism and was a total fabrication of Villoldo. What a disappointment. I suggest if you want authentic stories and teachings on South American shamanism look elseware."
3,An Interesting Book,"Although the main character isn't very likable, I enjoyed the inside view of a changing industry. As an author myself, of NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL (Judson Press), I have some firsthand knowledge of publishing and just how difficult it is for a new voice to be heard. My worst fears of how capriciously some publishing decisions are made were confirmed! But there will always be those of us who have things we must say, and the readers who appreciate hearing them."
1,Last Days of What??,"Besides being a bit short for a novel, The Last Days of Publishing seems to be missing so many things that could have made for an interesting and readable novel. I have to agree with one of the other reviews, few of the characters are well developed and they seem to come and go, often with minimal explanation. The plot is also weak and presented in out of chronological order, which makes for anticlimactic reading. Much of the information about publishing could easily be gleaned in various magazines and better written books, such as Betsy Lerner's ""The Forest for the Trees"" as well as the nostalgia for the 60's, like many of Tim O'Brien's novels, especially ""July, July"" (which isn't even his best novel). Aside from a clever cover, I can't recommend this book."
1,"How to Paint Trees, Flowers and Foliage","I think that this book was a waste of time. I bought this book in the hope that it would help me and my friends on the real word to strive to a glorious finish in our painting, that we were going to show in an oncoming show(now we can't because we do not want the embarassment of showing what we painted) I wanted to learn how to paint beautiful flowers for our house but I couldn't due to the poor job of the author of the book. The only information that it gave me was the stuff that I already know. now after spending [good money] plus shipping I am in even more debt than I already was. So thanks to that book I might have to go live in a shelter just because I wanted to be liked by my house mates even more than i already am.So if you were thinking of buying this book, DO NOT!!! it is terrible!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Wrong Compressor,"Accoring to Amazon compressor was said to fit my vehicle, upon arrival it is clear it will not. Thanks for wasting my time and money, I will gladly pay extra from reputable autoparts dealers rather than shadetree amazon..."
1,the package [ll never get,I never got it. I was sent the wrong part.I was senrt kc lights.UPS was to stop by and pick it up. But no show.This has been one big pain.Ill never order from amazon again.
1,WHAT YOU SEE YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT GET,This bracelet looks nothing close to the picture. In real life it resembles a thin wire (not like the sturdy bracelet like the picture) that a baby can easily twist and break off. It came with some wierd pin that seems to have no use anywhere. The packaging made it even worse and all in all it was a total waste of money buying this product.
3,Whaddaya want? They're utility blades!,"There are better blades that last longer and don't break as easily, but they're much more expensive. If you're just scoring sheet rock, these are fine. If you're cutting fiberglass shingles, plan on going through a lot of these. If you need a tough blade that holds its edge for a while, step up to the bimetal or some other high-quality blade."
4,Great Product.,"I actually wanted thicker blades. But, these do just fine. Having fresh blades on a demo job is quite important. The product arrived on time. No complaints here."
1,Buy Warranty From Sony,You can buy your sony TV from any place you like. Then call Sony and buy the extended warranty directly from Sony. a 5 year plan for $1000-$1500 item is only $149.99 plus tax.
2,4-Year Service Plan for Televisions,"I purchased the 4-year service contract thru Amazon (actually 3 years since the 1st year is covered under warranty). I never received a conformation mail from the third party vendor (Service Contracts from NEWCORP). I have called their customer service and am currently waiting for them to send me written confirmation. It is also unclear on whether I need to provide them with additional information before my service contract becomes ""valid"" since they had no further information about my purchase from Amazon (e.g., model number of the TV, etc.). If this is any sign of the type of service I will be receiving, I have serious reservations about this service plan."
3,Pricing Confusion,"The only way to find out which plan you need is to call N.E.W. customer service. The rep was prompt and courteous and tells me that the applicable plan is based on the cost of the tv - a $2000 tv requires the $279.99 plan, for example. In the case of a projection tv the projector lamp is not covered. However they do offer in-home service for larger items tv's - which is probably a big reason for the increased cost.Since I haven't purchased or used the plan I can only rate it on what is nominally offered, which seems to be less than can be bought elsewhere for the price."
1,Um Hello.....,A month has passed and still no response other than getting a receipt from Amazon. Did I purchase a warranty or did I just roll down the window and toss out some cash?
3,Can't tell much about it so far no problems with item covered,"The pricing on this service plan seemed fair, and the fine print wasn't to awfully offensive, but I haven't actually had an oportunity to use the warrantee yet"
2,Beware,"I bought this extended warranty at time of purchase and never used it until 3 years later. The bulb blew out and when I submitted claim it was matter of factly denied. I then contacted amazon.com and they really came to my rescue. In the end the repairs were made but only with the help of the customer service reps at amazon.com. Beware of extended warranty compies but if you have a problem go to amazon.com they really came through for me. I won't ever purchase another extended warranty in the future only becuase they don't like to pay claims, they promise to cover. beware!!!!"
3,Take it or leave it,"If you're buying a very expensive HDTV, you will probably want an extended warranty. Be sure to check the length of your manufacturer's warranty, though, as it may be good enough. Better safe than sorry, though."
5,E--mazing Mazes (jewel case),"my 7 year old granddaughter loves mazes so this was perfect for her ,she loved it."
1,DOES NOT FIT,FLIMSY NON FITTING AND WHEN YOU SEND IT BACK THE POSTAGE WILL COST MORE THAN PRODUCT ITSELF. Just dont buy it
5,great product,"I have used these before. Last for years on key, and are sturdy. But I screwed up - doesn't fit with patio door. Will have to figure a way to jerry-rig"
3,Takes some work...,"These are a great idea but they don't fit all keys well. For my keys I had to drill a new hole to hold the key in place and run a small cable tie through it to keep the key in place. I also had to use some J B Weld to hold my other key in place inside the thing. THEN I had to drill another hole above the key to place it on my keyring as the only other option is to put your key on the ring by the hole on either side of the wing and that makes it difficult to turn the key in the lock! Notice in the picture it does not show the thing on a key ring, it does not show the inside if the product and does not show that there are no holes to really put the thing on a keyring. Great idea but needs revision! Good thing the price is right."
2,limited benefit,"the handle of one of the enablers broke off the key, leaving me unable to get into my office. i found them of limited value for tough keyholes and even for relatively easy ones."
1,Enabler key,This enabler does not fit overe the newer car keys with jacketes on them. It also does not fit normal enry keys to my house.
1,don't fit car keys,These are just not made for car keys. Way too small for my door keys also. Bought them and tossed them out....would have cost too much to return.
4,Cured My Craving,"I went through a period recently when I had a huge craving to hear some yodeling. After listening to this CD, I don't have that craving anymore. But, I'm sure it will come back. When it does, I'll listen to this CD again."
5,Hooked On Yodelng CD,This is excellent. The quality of the recording is the best and the performer(s) are wonderful. I'm really enjoying fine listening. Thanks
5,Cecilie review,The service I experience with this seller was first rate. I would not hesitate to do business with this seller again. Great experience!
2,Difficult to use,"This was the biochemistry book for my undergraduate course, but I hardly used it because it is not written in clearly understood language. It does have a glossary which is useful for looking up definitions, but when I would go to the index to clarify something we learned in class, chances were none of the references would apply to the concepts I was looking for, and if it did, it was incomprehensible. The general consensus among my classmates was that the book was worthless. The only useful feature is the end of chapter problems, and the solutions to these are found at the end of the book. I understand Lippincotts biochem is supposed to be pretty good, so you may want to investigate that if you are looking for a biochemistry book."
1,Not for someone new on biochemistry,"I'm taking biochemistry for the first time and the book is almost useless. It has many errors and the explanations are not clear. To study for my class I have to look for other books. I don't recomend this book to anyone who really wants to learn biochemistry, specially if they're taking the class with a bad professor. I'm not saying this because I don't like the class; I like chemistry and I thought biochemistry would be very exciting. But, the book isn't a good reference, neither the CD-ROM it includes. Thank God I bought it used."
4,excellent,"Anyone who believes Burroughs is a racist fails to understand the era in which he wrote. One must remember that by today's standards even fictional heros such as Buck Rogers and the more contempory James Bond could be considered racist and sexist. This book gives credit to Burroughts imagination and the fact that he estabished the basis for today's ""super heros."" His writing is crisp and his plots were very imaginative. This bio does him justice and is better than the one previous effort I am aware of. This is a keeper"
1,Almost as bad as The Big Swingers,"John Taliaferro seriously needs to do his homework in the future if he ever decides to write another biography. Aside from Taliaferro's condescending, ubiquitous attempts to paint ERB as a Hitlerite bigot (a position not supported by a less bombastic analysis of ERB's life and work), he riddles the book with so many factual errors both about ERB's work and about his life it almost reads like a novel parodying the subject's life rather than an attempt at bringing a world-famous author to life. I highly recommend avoiding this error-riden piece of tripe and suggest anyone wanting to know what ERB was like in real life read Irwin Porges' Edgar Rice Burroughs: The Man Who Created Tarzan. Although that book is immense, it provides a much more balanced view of a seminal author's life and work and avoids all the errors and sometimes downright lies Taliaferro inflicts on readers in this vanity exercise."
3,Sympathetic look at the creator of Tarzan and his times,"A solid yet sympathetic look at Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan and other fantasy novels. The book delves into many details of Burroughs' life, and honestly tries to present the man, his views, and his works in his strengths and his weaknesses. Mostly for dedicated fans of Burroughs. Otherwise this read will probably not grab you, and you will find yourself skimming over many parts of the book. If your only exposure to Burroughs is the new Disney movie pass on this book and get the original novel, Tarzan of the Apes, instead!"
5,This is a great read,I really enjoyed Mr. Taliaferro's incisive treatment of the author's life and unusual ideas.
3,It's ok,I has some good recipes but most of them seem to be vegetarian. The Moosewood family restaurant special is much better
3,Others by them are better,"This book could be great, like so many of their others, but I think that it's gimmicky in that they rely way too much on soy products in this one. I'm all for adding soy to foods if it belongs there, but not if it is added just to add nutrition only. It can really ruin the texture of a dish, but they claim repeatedly that ""no one will even know it's in there!"" I think that if you have to hide something in your food, maybe it shouldn't be there at all. The one good thing about this, though, is that there are a lot of dishes for vegans in here.Where they don't rely on the soy gimmick, the food has been really wonderful, as always. Try these: lemon ricotta pancakes, Indian curried potato wrap, marinated feta with pita, and Muhallabia (cardamom-cinnamon) ice cream."
3,Getting rid of this one right away!,"I have four other Moosewood cookbooks and could not find one recipe in this one that I wanted to make! The dishes are strange and unappealing and most seem to involve a lot more preparation time and unfamiliar ingredients (seaweed and goat cheese, for instance) than previous cookbooks. Get this one only if you are adventurous and love to spend lots of time preparing your meals."
3,Good for some--not useful to me,"I love the Moosewood style but have so many cookbooks I decided I would use this one very seldom, hence returned. Cookbook had nice creative & international,variety, but I just have too many!"
1,The Boringest Game Around In The Universe,"Oh my gosh! This game is the worst game ever made in the whole world. It had the most boring games in it. Instead of playing that non-fun game for 15 minutes, I would rather make bean sprouts my favorite food. If you hate boring and stupid games, I would suggest you not to buy or rent this game. If you already have it, tough luck!"
1,BORING game...nothing worse than this!!!,"This game is fun for a few of the events, but the bobsledding UGH ,B_O_R_I_N_G!!!, and the luging, it is so slow that if you were going any slower you'd be goin backwards! It is ridiculous! The snowboarding halfpipi(N64) that is fun, and the freestile skiing arials are cool also. The game is ok but, I wouldn't recommend it for people who want to actually sit and play 1 game for hours on end (not a good idea). If you just want to do something for 5 minutes I guess it's ok, but not one of the best games by FAR!!! I suggest going and buying Tony Hawks pr skater, or cruis n' world or something that doesn't look like it has been slopped together in 5 minutes!"
3,"Good Seller, poor writer",I purchased this trilogy after reading Milagro Beanfield war a couple of times through the years. I loved that book.....the remainder of the trilogy is better left undiscovered......
3,good but didn't get me...,Maybe this one was a little disapointing to me because I seen all the 5 stars and I was probably expecting more of the same...but that wasn't the case... Don't get me wrong I'm not saying it was a bad album... but it just wasn't anything special here... the clean vocals sounded whiny.. and wimpy... and just annoyed me at times... I would of given this album 3 and a half stars if i give half stars... because it isn't that bad...but not worthy of 4....
5,This cd can sing you to sleep while it tears your soul out,"Scars of Tomorrow have created 11 tracks of hardcore beauty. There is not one weak song on this entire album. The standout tracks on this album are ""suffocating words"" and ""reflections"". The songs were written and played perfectly and the lyrics are outstanding. If you like band such as Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, All that Remains, Atreyu or hardcore music at all, pick up ""rope tied to the trigger"", it will not dissappoint!"
1,footnotes,The footnotes are not formatted in the kindle version of this book. Do not buy the book if you think reading footnotes is important.
3,Cajun Marine,"Magazine was in good shape, however it did not have much usable information. Have not gotten much use from the book."
5,My Favorite Cookbook,"I am on my second copy of this book. The first one finally fell apart from ""over-use"". I've given numerous copies of this book to friends and family. Everyone loves it as much as I do. This is the first book I go to when looking for a recipe and I've never been disappointed."
5,Closer to the heart of God,"This book is a delight to read. In just one sitting it so clearly show's you the heart of Abba, as only Manning can do. The tender story of healing in a boy that is you, and is me. As you turn each page the layers of your heart are stripped away to expose the tender heart that God created. The heart that beats only to love Him and to enjoy fellowship with Abba! I will be reading in anytime I need to be reminded of His love for me."
4,Connection to Thomas Klise?,"I have been looking all over the Internet to see if anyone has discussed the similarities between Manning's _The Boy Who Cried Abba_ (orig. 1996) and Thomas Klise's classic _The Last Western_ (1974). Both novels share a young, red-headed, implausibly multiracial protagonist named Willie who grows up in Mexico/New Mexico. In both, Willie's father is a migrant worker and his grandmother is a wise woman named either Cool Dawn or Calm Sunset. In both, Willie attempts to offer a drink of water to a painted Christ in his local church, causing the paint to run and angering the priest. The plots differ fundamentally, but the similarities do not end here. I would be very curious to hear whether Manning has ever mentioned the influence of Klise's novel on his works. If anyone can point me to a relevant discussion, I'd be most grateful!"
4,Great Parable,"Delightful, very quick read. This was the first Brennan Manning book I ever read after being introduced to his writing while on a mission trip in Austria. Great parable!"
4,nice but boring,"The message of this book is great, but it's just kind of dull. I think it would be good to read aloud to a kid, but for an adult, it didn't have as much content as I had hoped. The ending was beautiful, though. Worth reading...."
5,As Objective As It Gets,"If one is looking for a documentary on the life and teaching of Jesus, this one is about as objective as it gets. While this documentary addresses questions and gives answers to some of the most common questions regarding Jesus, the Christ, it also address some of the challenges to some of the commonly held beliefs. For an objective mind, this documentary is worth viewing.Apparently, there are at least two different narrators to this documentary. I wanted the one narrated by Avery Brooks; however, the one I got was narrated by Tom Hodgkins."
5,Very informative,"I enjoyed this dvd very much. I like the information given, and the information in the dvd goes right along with the information I just read in Stephen Miller's book, The Jesus Of The Bible. I especially love how they recreate the ancient cities and show us what life was probably like in Bible times, that was interesting. The only thing I thought was absurd was the lady mentioning the resurrection happening because Jesus didn't actually die during the crucifixion. I thought that was an insane theory!! Jesus did die and was gloriously resurrected. The Glorious Resurrection is also given in this dvd and they actually dispute what the lady says, thankfully. This dvd really is open to faith and what Christianity teaches. I also didn't like the comment about Judas given by the man who said there wasn't a betrayal. This contradicts scriptures, but this comment didn't take away my interest in the dvd. This is a good addition to anyone's study."
5,Supplemental Reading required,"The author stated that the works of Emerson and Thoreau were omitted due to limitations of space. However since Emerson is a central character who is referred to frequently, the reader needs some support. I recommend reading the Emerson biography, Robert Richardson's ""The Mind on Fire"" either before or in conjunction with Miller's book. This book, like Miller's, does a great job of telling the Transcendentalist story . Together, a clear picture emerges. Having Wikipedia nearby is also very helpful as there are extensive references to authors and philisophical terminology. With Wikipedia you will probably have no trouble and will stay engaged regardless of your background."
3,High Price and Little Extra Value,"I expected to get the video cut scenes of all three video games plus add-ons and that is what I got. All of it would probably have fit on one DVD and the use of three DVDs was certainly a waste of resources. It makes the package look bigger than it actually is, but don't be fooled, there are not very much extras to be found on the DVDs. There are some trailers and a bit artwork and that is about it.They should have make it one DVD and sell it for $9.99 and it would have been a great value. Sold like this, is it a bit too expensive IMO and the $19.95 price tag is not justified by anything else than the fact that they broke the stuff down to three DVDs, which increased the costs for the product material."
2,Overpriced for what you get.,"Lack of availability seem to have driven the price for this product up, surpassing the cost of purchasing each game individually and extracting the videos yourself. It's also been mentioned in another review that it neglects to include cutscenes from 'D2: Lord of Destruction,' from which I'll infer (at the risk of a first class flaming) that it also leaves out 'W3: The Frozen Throne'.Blizzard's cinematics are indubitably awesome, but for this, you're better off with youtube.Five stars for the videos, two for the package."
5,Blizzard Entertainment DVD Collection (Cut scenes,what can i say about this product if you love Blizzard Entertainmentgame's then then you know how good this product is.
4,It's so true!,"When I read this all I could think was - it's so true! My father-in-law said it was so good they should make a book out of it! My friend's twelve year old thinks it's a riot, especially when the stories are about the kids."
4,Great really,"Little Bit Thin on the rubber thickness, But Really Great Tires. Very Good Riding low noise and vibration, Nice Looking too!!"
2,Poor quality DVD,"The quality of this DVD set is poor. Each disc begins with a blue screen, if you're lucky to get that far. It takes several clicks on the remote to get the DVDs to work. The fourth disc wouldn't start at all. The DVD player did not leave the ""loading"" stage. We had this problem with two Season 2 sets. The first one that we ordered was returned for the same problems. The replacement DVD arrived promptly,but had the same poor manufacturing quality. It's too bad, Gullah Gullah Island is a wonderful series!"
4,As advertised,"I bought this for a gift. It is just as advertised and my co-worker was really pleased. The only thing I didn't like, was a large price sticker on the front of the box before it was wrapped in plastic. I had to slice the platic open to peel off the price sticker, so it didn't look as nice when I went to give it away."
3,Just Okay,Thought it would be the real writings and not the play versions. That's okay because it is easy reading for a child & that is what I really needed.
5,A Gold Mine,"At the end of the day you're in business to make a profit, right? This is an easy-to-read book with simple strategies for increasing profit through better management, money, markeiting and merchandising strategies. Brad shows you how."
4,perfectly suited for its title,"I ordered this book to work on a thesis I was doing for my Mass Comm. focus. I wanted to find a book that gave me some direction on what thinkers from past the present have had an impact on the media environment that we now find ourselves in today. This book was exactly what I was looking for. It gave a small chapter to each philosopher or person who played an important part in the history of journalism and media theory. Furthermore, Altshull writes in an extrememly lucid and simple way - making the book both engaging, easy, and enjoyable without losing any of the important content. His footnotes were very useful for find other sources as well. The organization, presentation, and content found with the pages of this book were perfectly suited for my needs and have helped me handle surbeying the main points I was looking for in each philosopher. I recommend this book to any and all people."
1,Nothing new!,If you already have the previous edition (WISC-III Prescriptions) don't bother getting this volume. It has almost nothing new and does not devote much space to the new core subtests. The main chapters deal with the core subtests of the WISC-III and the case study at the end is based on the WISC-R!
5,Thousand Nights and One Night,The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night is a very nice story which anyone can read it at any age i learnt alot i know the stories are not a true story but still we can find something from the story that is usefull for us. But the only thing i get confused is that we call the book arabian nights but the book is a fragment of a lost book of persian stories why the name is arabian night then ? At the start i thought that is a arabic story but after reading a book called the legendary past (myths) which is published in london i find out it is a persian story.
5,Giant Steps for Mankind,"The historical capture of Pastor Tommy Douglas's story takes one on a journey through vital & important steps forward in achieving access to healthcare for Canadians. From Pastor Tommy Douglas to Premier Tommy Douglas one views the actualization of this extraordinary man's unwavering vision of achieving tremendous advances for a Nation. This story and its production is simply breathtaking. The sweet and heroic depiction through vignettes of timeline is legendary.I enjoyed learning about actress Shirley Douglas's life through the historic journey of her father, Premier Tommy Douglas who also happens to be the grandfather of actor Kiefer Sutherland (Shirley's son).A must see for those whose affinity sings and praises 'Oh Canada'..."
5,A wonderful movie,"This movie tells the story of how Canada's citizens beat back the right wing to bring about universal healthcare, which is now supported by 80% of Canadians."
3,Pretty good but nothing fantastic,"When I got a Victory Records cd sampler with the purchase of a Thursday cd, I really liked the song Xerox on it. After listening to it several times, I decided to go get this cd. Now while it isn't the best out there, it is pretty good. To me there were a few too many songs that never really stood out to me or sounded too similar to one another. I like the vocals alot on here and its nice to have both styles on here, but it still doesn't help the fact that this band needs to improve a bit more for their next release."
4,Love This Product,"Before getting this product I woke up with crusty, bloody nose after a night with CPAP - even though I have the CPAP humidifier. This product ended all that. In the morning I use Neti-Pot to rinse the gel out, cause I use a bit more than suggested, and rub it way up there to prevent the crusting and bleeding. This product - along with oral gel - enables me to sleep through the night with CPAP.UPDATE: I went to using coconut oil - a dab up each nostril at night - for this because I didn't like that this gel would dry up into a thick goup during the night, and no longer do what I needed it to do."
2,Great Product,"Great Product ! Have had problems with Dry, Crusted Nose for years, that has affected my sleep. With this product I sleep better. Only two issues 1. Difficult to administer a 'single dose' and 2. The tube I got seemed to have a lot of AIR and not too much product ! For about $8 a pop I think they need to do better."
1,"Goopy, too thick, and caused blockages","I really love the sinus rinse formula from this company, but the gel is just bad. Had a problem with blockages and been using sudafed and lots of irrigation, but was starting to get nosebleeds. Not only did this not hydrate my dried out membranes, it solidified overnight and caused more blockages. Going back to Neosporin."
2,Too thick -- didn't work well with my CPAP,"First off, the packaging on this is hilarious. ""Dry nose protection for the whole family"" -- no, thanks. I'd rather not share.I found it too thick to use with my CPAP; it didn't squeeze out of the package well, and I didn't enjoy the smell. I will be buying more Ayr Saline Nasal Gel instead."
5,My son's favorite game..,College game is alot more fun than the pro one. All the neighbor kids are into this one.
3,Good main character but way too long,"This is a somewhat interesting tale of the struggle between darkness and the sick Earthsoul. Park's characterizations are convincing, including that of the hero Jase who struggles with his gifts that make him the most powerful sorcerer, one destined to save the Earthsoul, one whose power is so great as to threaten life around him. The tale of the girl who wants Jase is well-done. His attraction to a former brat and ardent love of that girl is too sudden. Park provides a variety of evil creatures of different power who attack, kill, and are destroyed. But these battles become repetitious and do not materially advance the plot. There seems to be a lack of a fully drawn real antagonist. Park's main problem is that the book is too long by a third. There is not enough driving the plot to keep the reader interested for 604 pages. In other words, reader interest flags. Only speed reading carried me through. I am not looking for Book Two."
1,It's the Wheel of Time revisted,"If you've read the Wheel of Time series, you're going to wonder how someone can have this much audacity. The power, darklings, the dark one, warders, etched swords from long ago, building materials made with the power, smoothing, ""Light!"" it's all there, along with the same plot. So... it's nothing new, this author has decided to ""create"" a slightly faster paced Wheel of Time, one without paragraphs describing some dress or whatever. And for that, it deserves the one star. :) Nothing original here. Someone should sue."
4,Jumbo,"In regards to Mr digiboomblasta, or whatever sadassed name he came up with: you are a moron. GLC are meant to be funny. No one except hardcore knobends like you take them seriously, I should know, Ive met the blokes.Oh, and dont call us welshies taffs. Only we can call ourselves that.Anyways, this ""album"" is hilarious. Probably only because Im from the 'port and such, but still. it makes me chuckle. PLease buy it and support the greatness.xxx"
3,Interesitng,"I wonder what the historians' take on this issue is nowadays? The BBC program was made late 80s I think. Surely a lot of water under the bridge since then. I mentioned the thesis, that FDR knew ahead of time that Pearl would be attacked, to a friend of mine, and she said, ""of course, they start all the big wars that way. But I would have done it too."" Well, geez, I don't know--what with the corporatization of warfare, etc,etc. But it always grieves me to think again that all my childhood ideology was built on agitprop history . . ."
5,One of my all-time favorites!,"This game may have been released in 1996, but it has much better racing and in general, more tracks to choose from than EA's NASCAR series. You can do an entire championship season with the entire 1996 season with the exception of Daytona. The best part of the game is that you can control the opponent strenght up to 120%! I've yet to play a decent simulation/arcade game on the PSX until I got this game."
3,The best for now; horrible packaging.,"When my favorite CL solution was discontinued, I had to find another. I am allergic to most products, and my doctor recommended this.It works well. I use just one drop in each eye in the morning and again before bed and I'm good all day (unless I cry).However, it's brutally expensive (Walmart has the best price). And the packaging is terrible. It's a strange little squeeze bottle that doesn't always dispense properly. It's hard to find in your purse. And, the worst possible thing about it: because it has some kind of little ball or something inside it, you can never tell when it's empty so you always have to carry a new one."
4,a nice addition to dry-eye therapy,"Oddly, I don't use contact lenses, but and opthamologist friend of mine told me to try these drops. On the plus side: No stinging, no blur, good symptom relief, minimum thickening with repeated uses (most drops based on food thickeners will become glops in the eye over time), good price.On the negative side: still only lasts 2-3 hours. (like all drops!)I would recommend this product as being effective."
5,Great product,I was experiancing difficulty with dry eyes and irritation when wearing my contacts. A technician at my doctor's office gave me a sample of this product to try. It is very good. Regular application solves the problem.
5,Love these eye drops!,"They moisten my contacts as they should. I've never worn contacts before so I actually don't have anything to compare it too, but I guess I don't need to. They do the job and I have no complaints."
3,More STrings,It's a great guitar but since it's for begginners I think they should of atleast put a extra pair of strings with the package.
5,trying understanding the arrows in between the green light on the tuner,the arrows between green light i don't understand. with one is up and with one is down. so i won't break the stings. there's no info on the kona guitar site?
2,Guitar for Dummies,"When we first opened the box we were impressed- nice looking guitar, case, book, cd- all in one package. However we were unable to get a good sound out of the guitar. We thought the strings were bad and replaced them. That didn't help. We took it to an instrument repair man and were told the neck is warped. We will be returning the entire purchase."
3,Not exactly what it seems,"I was very excited to receive my guitar in the mail, although I was a little weary after reading reviews which said that the guitar came damaged.When i received my guitar--everything seemed fine and packaging did not seem to be a problem. However, once I got everything open I realized they sent me ELECTRIC GUITAR FOR DUMMIES instead of the basic/acoustic book.If this didn't bother me enough--the cracked audio cd that came with it certainly did! The guitar is not bad for beginners--but I hope that others who buy this item will receive what is actually advertised (correct book and UN CRACKED CD) and in GOOD condition."
2,Looks good... at first,"I was initially pleased, however twangy the sound and useless the CD. The kicker: the neck of the guitar warped after a few months to the point where it's now unplayable. Oh, and one of the strings snapped. Guitar for Dummies indeed."
3,Kona guitar pack,We bought the guitar pack for our 15-year old beginner. The guitar looks great but she cannot play it because the tuner does not work....the green light just continuously blinks. The bag that come in the package is not protective...just eliminates dust collection...we'll need to buy a hard case. I'll give a second review once we resolve the tuner issue and can hear the tonal quality of the guitar.
4,Great guitar for the money!,"I bought this kit to learn how to play a little bit and once it was here I took it to a few guitarists I know and they all said it was a great buy for the money I laid out. So for that I would have given 5 stars, but then there was the book.Guitar for Dummies....if this is for dummies I must be brain dead because there is nothing easy and very little that even makes sense to the complete noob. Again I showed it to the guitarists I know and they chuckled and said that it probably wouldn't help me until I learned the basics and it seemed to be a bit more for the guy that has played a little bit already.So for the guitar 5 stars. For the book...2 stars."
3,good buy,"This is a good buy for beginners. Pros: All-in-one package, tuner is good. Cons: This guitar is a little hard to learn with. The fret boards are really hard and playing chords are a bit difficult."
4,cd,hey guys i got my guitar stuff from amazon. im wondering how d cd works? where i can play d cd? if in d computer when u play it where can i find d cd? and does is have adobe player level requirement?
5,love it!,I got this guitar pack for my dad for christmas. He's always wanted to play guitar but is definitely a beginner. The guitar came with all the essentials for a beginner (except for a guitar strap). Everything came in excellent condition and really exceeded my expectations. My dad loves it! I'd advise anyone who wants to get a beginner's guitar for a reasonable price to buy this one!
4,Guitar for Dummy,"This was a good purchase, great service, prompt delivery with proper packaging. Steel string Kona of good quality. The guitar plastic bag is kind of a waste, but will protect it from scratch's, moisture and does provide ease of transpo and storage. I found the tuner adequate, and easy to operate."
5,Great Bday gift for a beginner....,Bought this set for my hubby as a birthday present. Arrived exactly on time and in amazing condition. Gig bag is kind of flimsy but since he won't be traveling with it anytime soon it gets the job done. The book and accessories are awesome and really breaks everything down to help learning! Love it!
5,Awesome for beginners,"It's a little long in the neck for my son, but otherwise it's great for beginners. Good quality, excellent price!"
1,Very bad,This is very bad guitar. My wife ordered it for me as Christmas gift. I was very exited to open it and found out it totally malfunctions. All the strings touch the frets. There is no way to adjust them. Very disappointed. Have to return it. Don't buy this one. Spend a little bit more for others. I would give a no star for rating if I could.
4,smart dummie,Great buy. Worth the money. The guitar is of very good quailty and the book is easy to understand and use.
4,worth it,"I bought this set for my husband. With the guitar being the most important part of the deal it was great. case is more of a cover, the book is basic(not in a bad way) ... but the tuner didnt seem to work too well. I say for someone that is just learning and wanting to see if they like it this is the perfect route to go."
2,"Guitars for Dummies,","I bought this guitar kit for my teenage son for Christmas. Unfortunately before the sun went down Christmas day the guitar already had 2 broken strings!! He has had the same old guitar since he was 9 and although out of tune the strings have never broken. Needless to say, i was disappointed with this purchase. Great value if the guitar wasnt so cheaply made."
3,Good for beginners,"A good little package for my 13 year old just getting started. Her instructor suggested I not buy a high-end guitar to start, simply because she may not like playing. The guitar is a good quality; however, the action is a little high and needs to be adjusted because it is a little harder to push the strings. The book was helpful, in combination with some other books and on-line exercises, she has taught herself to play. I consider the gig bag a sort of ""free"" throw in because that's all it's worth. Both zippers fell off in the first few months. But, overall, a good purchase for a beginner."
5,GUITAR,IT IS REALLY EASY FOR MY 16 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO USE. SHE LOVES IT. THE GUITAR IS NICE AND NOT CHEAP LOOKING.
4,"guitar was great but the package was badly damaged, the delivery man hurried away. Thankfully the hole in the box missed guitar.",I enjoy the guitar and have been able to follow the book well. They box was not very sturdie and really left the guitar vulnerable for abuse. I arrived on time. It's a standard guitar. I could have gone to the local music store for similar guitar and book.
4,Very Nice,"I recieved this package on time and was really amazed at how beautiful this guitar is. I have played in the past and wanted to pick it up again, this package has alot of bang for the buck for beginners. The only thing is u may want to pick up an extra set of string of your liking, for it does'nt come with extra. The guitar has a nice sound, tuner works just fine and the book with cd has me picking up cords pretty easily. Nice for the price."
2,Tinny,"Starting off with what I liked about this package:This is an absolutely beautiful guitar, and the tuner seems to work very well.However, the book is a little bare-bones, and my biggest problem is that out of the box while I was trying to tune the guitar all the strings sounded very tinny. Now, I am a complete beginner when it comes to guitars, but after some research and fiddling around with the truss rod I have gotten the tinniest out of the 1, 2, and strings completely, there is an occasional tin on the 4 string, the 5 string is still there but not too bad, and the 6 string is horrible. So, I caution you if you believe this package to be a very quick way to start learning guitar it might not be the case."
3,Get what you pay for,"I figured on being bored over a long Winter in North Iowa, so thought I'd learn to play guitar. Since I'm a 'dummy', this seemed like a good place to start. The Gig Bag? It'll keep the dust off. Not much better I can say about it. The booklet? You are much better served by doing an internet search for free instruction and training videos.Now, the guitar. One dead fret, but it is the 14th fret on the 1st string, so I don't imagine I'll be blasting that acoustic note anytime, anyway. Many small marks and slight dents, which leads me to believe this is a refurbished return, or maybe just a low cost model. Which is what I paid for it. Low cost. So it is hard to complain.The bright spot: the electronic tuner works perfectly.When it is all said and done, a beginner could probably find a nice used guitar that is a better value. I'm not complaining, because I knew I was being cheap when I bought it."
5,The best book out there for developing a shooting schedule.,"I took Production Management in film school and this book blows away what we used as our textbook. It will definitely steer you to getting things done in a professional manner, whether it is managing locations or developing a shooting schedule. This is the one book you need to make sure everything runs smoothly."
2,Less Than What I Would Have Expected from Focal Press,"I received a review copy for a film class that I help teach. In reading through the first few chapters, I noticed it has a rather casual, slapdash style that is all too common in many recent film how-to texts.Focal Press has slipped in recent years, especially when it comes to their editions from overseas. It would seem that the cachet of having a foreign author is authority enough to justify the publication of a particular book.I stopped reading when I came to the paragraph where the author states, to paraphrase, ""Sometimes the screenwriter neglects to number his / her scenes due to laziness and the production manager has to do it for him."" ( With no explanation of the ""spec script"" rules of format vs. ""production scripts."" It was at this point I became convinced of the author's lack of understanding of the production management process."
2,This is an overview at best.,"I have purchased (and immediately returned, after thumbing through) this book, as after a couple of decades in the business I am now moving up to management. This book might be a useful read for a complete neophyte, or a student, perhaps it even ""blows away"" other school type textbooks on the subject as the previus reviewer suggested. For a professional, it is of little use. It touches on all subjects associated with production, but none of them are treated with sufficient depth. One thing is certain: you will definitely not be an well informed production manager if that is all you will ever read to get ready for that particular challenge, nor will you be ready to go out there, and pass yourself off as a pro.."
5,Great Product,This product works quickly and effectively. You will not be disappointed. Price is great and service was very good.
5,Great with a Mac and fast too.,"I originally bought this drive to use with a Mac Mini that did not have a dual layer drive. It worked fine with OS X 10.4 and I have since used it with my MacBook Pro upgraded to 10.5.x. The standard DVD burn is much faster than the internal drive, I did not see the slow burning that some have reported; however, I did have it sitting horizontally since it can go either way. The dual layer capability has always worked perfectly and is great for backing up big files (I am a graphic designer so a DL DVD burner is a must). No additional software was needed to burn on the Mac, just plug'n'play but it does work great with Toast for DVD-video burning.Overall I am very pleased with this drive especially after having tried several external (and internal) drives that claimed to be mac compatible and were not...including a Pioneer slot drive that would periodically try to murder my by spitting out a DVD spinning at 24x speed or so."
4,Price is Right,"I purchased this burner through Amazon and it was shipped very quickly by ANTOnline. I haven't tried the Nero software which is included because I'm using ProShow to create and burn DVD slideshows.As others have said, it burns at about 1/2 of the advertised speed. I occasionally have trouble with a DVD where the writing process will not start. The burner is running but nothing happens. I don't know if that is a problem with the DVD, the software or the burner. Otherwise I am satisfied with this purchase.I'm not sure that you can do any better for the price."
2,"It used to work, but.",I cut quite a few discs with this but now it is only a reader. The write mechanics have given out. So figure about a 100 to 200 DVD writes or so before it craps out.
1,Unbelievably horrible,"This drive started off badly and quickly got worse. When I insert a movie DVD into the drive, it will kick it out EIGHT times before playing it. This happens EVERY SINGLE time, since it was new. Blank DVDs are only a little less obnoxious: I have to erase any disk before recording, even if it's new. Finally a year after I bought this thing it quit working entirely. I gleefully smashed it to pieces, which is the only pleasure I ever got from this totally nasty Sony product.This is definitely my last Sony product. Not only did Sony choose to install computer cracker rootkits each time you play one of their CDs, but now even the hardware side of the company has become infected withe same customer loathing for which the media side of Sony has become infamous. That's it. The end. No more Sony for me."
2,but I have a problem with this unit,I don't know the problem is because of Nero 7 or DVD burner or my machine! but I am not able to solve it and non of the customer services (Sony or Nero) are able to solve it too. the problem is after burning the DVD the quality of picture is very bad which I guess it is because of the interlacing. I paid 60 dollors extra to upgrade Nero 7 to full version but still I am not able to burn my DVD (which I am getting with my Panasonic Camcorder and while playing back with camcorder is perfect). so I don't recommend this product at all.
2,Problems,I have used this product since 7/07 and it works with only one of my three computers. I would not recommend this product if you need you work with the newest hardware/software systems.
2,Couldn't believe this,"Bought this burn a while back along with a 100 pack of TDK DVD record ables 16x, up to now not one has been burn but i had this long time sony blank laying around try burning it and it works i don't know minds must be bad cause it can't burn any DVD only SONY DVD so far; but it was good clear picture every thing"
3,Works great with Macs too! Burn speeds much lower than stated.,"Despite the box saying Windows-only compatibility, this DVD burner works just fine my Mac Powerbook with Toast 8. However, the burn speed is far slower than Sony claims. I was only able to get around 5x burns with 16x DVD media. It may due to its vertical orientation (vertical drives must burn slower). But overall, a very nice, inexpensive no-frills DVD burner."
5,Nice drive!,"I was debating upgrading the slot drive in my Powerbook G4, then figured since I only burn dvds at home I could get something less expensive - this was a great choice. It works flawlessly, as do so many devices on Mac - plug it in, no installation of drivers necessary. Toast works great with it. So does iTunes. Burn speeds with dvd-rs of 8x or so, but cd's are much much faster. If your old Superdrive is conking out, this is a decent alternative to spending a lot of money on labor to replace it. Dude at the computer store said the newer Macs are coming out with Sony drives so Tiger and Leopard should work fine with this drive."
2,Disturbing but not the gorefest of legend...,"It took years of knowing this title existed for me to see it on a really low grade vhs copy in a friend's basement theater in or around 1993. Can't say the dvd release really helped the quality of the source material... but it's hard to complain about quality when the movie in question's main payoff scene is a badly edited ""corpse humping""."
5,Best Case for MBPs,"I love this case - it's the best one for the MBP in my opinion. It's protective, compact, and very stylish. I"
4,Good for confined spaces,"Pepper gels are better than pepper sprays in confined spaces, because there's no risk to spray yourself if the wind is against you. On the other hand, this product has a pencil thin spray and requires somewhat precise aiming to be functional. The can features the flip-to-use top, which is nice, but the activator is somewhat hard (make sure you squeeze it hard, or you'll have a puny pepper gel stream coming out of the can.) Make sure to also check theSABRE RED Pepper Spray Home & Away Protection Kit. The Sabre features a pepper gel/foam spray, which also offers some protection against the wind, but has a much wider target area."
5,great protection,I hope I never have to use this spray but if I do I am confident that it will do the job it is supposed to do. I bought this spray to have by my bedside and I have a keychain spray as well. This one was a little big for my pocket but it fits the bill for household protection.
1,PEPPER SPRAY,How can you review a pepper spray?The container looks good and size is about right to handle easily.I have no intention of testing it. Just hope I never have to use it!
4,This really is a gel,"This stuff comes out like silly string and is not a spray, so backwash and getting hit by your own spray while if the wind is out isn't that much of a problem. Works well, but it is a fairly substantial sized can - about the size you would see on a LEO's belt."
5,hard one to test,"looks good, shoots far. I need a volunteer to help me find out how effective it is though!!! :) I do like how the stuff is easy to aim without the risk of blowback. I was worried about it being to thick and making a gunky mess but that doesn't seem to be a problem."
4,"Ok, but little hard to aim.","Shoots far, but the gel bends a little when shooting it at far distance (12-16 feet). It works better at close distances, but the pepper gel is a very thin shot, making it hard to aim properly. I would go with Mace Foam or some type of spray. They don't shot as far, but you will find it easier to hit your target,Robert"
3,The can is the problem,"I've had three of these, and unfortunately they all ""weep"" a little from the nozzle. Obviously this can lead to stains and very unpleasant surprises in the ""pocket area"" and eyes.Furthermore, the spray distance steadily declines over a period of three years, which is when the cans absolutely need to be replaced.As other reviewers have pointed out, you can't safely keep one of these in a purse without a holster of some kind, as it is far too easy for a small object to depress the sprayer button."
5,best mace ever,I have several different types of mace and this one I have for in my home (living alone it makes me feel better) and this one is a good size and the gel that doesn't blow back and it a very strong smell and is colored as well so if the person got away the police could identify them.. glad I went with this one.. also the cap makes it impossible to spray in the wrong direction.. not to mention great delivery time!
5,Very Satisfied,I love my xbox 360 elite I play it almost everday or my b/friend...I recommend this sytem..I love xbox live arcade and gears of war is sweet! I highly recommend it I love it.
2,Xbox 360 Elite DustBuster loud.,It's LOUD. The DVD drive in the Elite sounds like a dust buster. I kid you not. WARNING. You will be sorry if that sort of thing bothers you. It bothers me. I am going to return it and get a different system.
4,"converted PS owner, not by choice.","I was somewhat forced to purchase this, due to 99% of my friends owning xbox's instead of PS3's.Originally, i was sold on the PS3. Blu-ray readability, 60gb. hard drive, wifi, sixaxis controllers... etc.But i have to say, now an owner of an xbox elite, it definitely has its own merit. i haven't been able to experience online play with a ps3 yet, but online play with a 360 is amazing. being able to download game extras, listen to music while playing games, watching videos in hi-def on a HDTV from your computer through the xbox, i am definitely impressed.the only complaint i have is that it has hung up while playing rainbow 6 vegas with three others in co-op play. i haven't been able to determine whether its the game's fault, the system's fault, or my internet connection. crackdown has hung once or twice, but other than that, i have had absolutely no problems.ok, two complaints. having to buy the hddvd player is gonna suck."
5,Third time's the charm...,"The Xbox 360 Elite was the second unit I purchased and despite a service return to Microsoft, I did receive a new unit and had no problems at the time of this review. The 120 GB hard drive and 30 feet wireless controluse are plenty... the InterCooler unit was extra but I was encouraged to buy one. Every 360 game I purchased I was able to play and many of the original Xbox titles play well (Halo and Halo 2 are wonderful). I give 2 thumbs up for the `Elite."
3,why MS,"First off the XBOX 360 is a great system hands down, but why are they doing this it looks like they are trying to show sony whats up. If you look at it though it rips alot of people off that have bought the 360 before this. The system is worth $479 and the hard drive is going to be $179 so you if you never bought the 360 you are just going to pay $80 more than the other 360 and $179 for the hard drive. The hard drive does come with a data transfer cable though so you can trasnfer all the stuff you have on your 20 gig to your 120 gig so thats pretty cool. Oh well the black looks cooler than the white though and why couldnt MS think of this before, those money grubing fools."
5,the best console ever made,come on how could anyone not buy this over a ps3 the core pack is better then the ps3 360 has better graphics thay can play just as high of HD as a ps3 and with the elite system it comes with a way bigger hard drive for less then the ps3 with there normal one pritty much so get the 360 its over all better then the ps3 in all ways and its cheaper well I guess Microsoft will always be better then sony its got way more money yep 360 is the best
3,"Agreed, too little too late","Why would microsoft even think about doing this now? we've wanted a bigger HDD for god knows how long and they release it now with a new xbox with HDMI, wow. and i believe someone at microsoft said that we now have a bigger HDD than the PS3 and we kept it under $500. little do they realize that it still has no HD playback unlike the PS3. I own both a 360 and a PS3 so you can't say this is a little biased, but if your looking for a Hi-Def player for cheap, get a ps3. if you want a hi-def player and game system, get the 360 pro/elite with the HD-Dvd drive for about $680."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is my 1st review and a warning to others, I just recieved my 360 elite, and was suppost to be from Amazon ,I am a prime member and was expecting a New product withing the 2 days. What i recieved was a tatty box which was ripped , inside was ripped packaging, including an empty bag where im guesing the controller or headset used to be as i was missing both along with the hard drive , DO NOT BUY"
1,Broke in 1 day!!!,"Well, I hooked it up, had it running, and was very happy. The next day I hit the power switch and saw three blinking red lights. A quick google search revealed that I was screwed. I bought through Circuit City and Microsoft agreed to fix it, but that doesn't change the fact that I will not have it for a month, not to mention the hassle of shipping it. Hopefully most aren't like this. But, if I had it to do again, I'd wait until more people had the Elite before I bought one. I'd like to make sure that the system had been user-tested. Believe me, this sucks. If you buy, I hope you have better luck. Hope this helped your decision."
1,poor manufactured quality,"After much soul searching and research, I finally decided to get the Xbox 360 Elite based on its library of games, present and near-future.Unfortunately, the hardware is a piece of junk. First off, the unit is noisy as all hell, and after just a few minutes, the console and monster power supply get extremely hot. Finally, right out of the box, the unit didn't work! I had to send it back.Do some internet searches regarding failed Xbox units (especially the three red rings problem), and you will find a surprising number of people with problems with their consoles. Most have to send their units back to be repaired. There are some people who are even on their fourth or fifth units!YOU MUST BUY THE ""OPTIONAL"" EXTENDED WARRANTY IF YOU GET THIS! Keep this in mind if you are using price to determine which console to get.I returned it for a full refund and got the PS3 instead. Not as many good games, but overall I am very satisfied with it."
3,What you should know,"The XBOX Elite is a good idea too late. The games that are out for Xbox 360 don't use the 1080p Hi Def or the 7.1 Surround Sound of the new HDMI port. A 120 gig hardrive beats the PS3's , but is completely unecessary. Let me explain: All the games out on the 360 were meant to go along with the 360's 20 gig hardrive. The 120 gig of space may not even get half filled up. Sure the idea is great, but XBOX is going to have to come out with a NEW console sometime soon. Not the games, nor the HiDef movies out now can use the 1080p HiDef, or the 7.1 Surround Sound. Only so many XBOX buyers didn't get a 360 yet, and this console won't be a huge seler like the PS2, or even the Xbox 360. Oh, yeah it's black. Who cares?? As long as doesn't look like crap I'd like a console for what I got from it, not the color. One more thing. Apart from the new hardrive, HDMI, and included HDMI cable, and the black finish there are no differences between the XBOX Elite and the XBOX 360"
1,360=junk,"I've owned this product for 4 months and disk drive stopped working, sure it's under warranty but, after spending almost $600.00 on the system, extra controller and game I feel completely ripped off. Save yourself the aggravation and get the ps3."
5,love xbox 360,xbox 360 elite is great console ever...with all multimedia capabilities....dvd upscaling and hdmi is great...if you are true hardcore gamer than this console is for you..
2,Nice Hardware!,"No wireless, no HD player...add it all up and you will see that owning a 360 costs alot more than if you you just bought quality to begin with (PS3). Supposedly the Red Circle of Death is less common with these models but only time will tell."
3,High Hopes...,"I LOVE HDMI!!! That being said, the xbox 360 elite's only high point is its HDMI connection, which offers 1080p. Unfortunately, the Elite is still VERY loud and gets VERY hot (my old xbox 360 premium died because of overheating, gotta love the 3 red lights). The 120 gig harddrive is a nice feature, too bad it does not come with a transfer cable to transfer your files from your old harddrive to your new one. You have to fill out a form and mail/fax it to microsoft. I faxed it and received the transfer cable in a week (plus another week because it turned out that transfer cable was defective so i had to get a new one, thanks microsoft). If money is a big issue with you, then wait until microsoft launches a newer version of the elite (one that runs quieter and cooler). I would not have purchased the Elite if my Premium didn't die on me...I was waiting for the newer ones myself."
5,Awesome!,"Just a great system!! Has the games that I enjoy playing. I do prefer the 360 controller as opposed to the PS3, that's just me. So after having the console for over a year, I enjoyed playing it more with the recent games that came out. Not to mention the update on the dashboard. A little kiddie for my taste but the layout is straight forward. Flipping through the tabs are much crisper too.Overall, a great system to have with a lot of cool features. Xbox LIVE is a great experience to play with fellow gamers online. The addition of streaming movies through NetFlix is a plus. I have tried it and the quality is dvd-like. I haven't bought into the HD movie as of yet since I have a ton of dvd library invested that I just don't see the point of me buying HD-DVD or Blue Ray."
5,Awesome!!,"I purchased the xbox 360 for my son's birthday. It was easy to connect to the TV monitor. I have not allowed my son to do online gaming since he is 11, but he really loves it anyway. The purchase also coincided with the release of Halo 3. We are very happy with the xbox's clarity of graphics and the wireless controllers. I also purchased the service contract--if there is a problem in the 2nd year of ownership, everything is covered. We recently had a problem with our PSP and it cost us $90 to send to Sony for repair."
5,A Little Help?,"OK, I know nothing about this system but my son wants one for Christmas. A couple of questions for anyone to answer: To download games/movies we need to hook it up to the internet? Does it already come with games/movies on the hard drive? Can my son play his regular x-box games on this out of the box or do we need to install some kind of software, and where do we get that? and does anyone recommend buying the HD DVD player to go with this? Thank you very much in advance for your help."
1,DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE,"At $580, this SKU is $130 more than you can find it anywhere else. Also, many of them are bundled with two free games at retail, so this price is even more ludicrous. Otherwise, it's a great system with great games, and a huge hard drive."
1,Bigger HDD same poorly made console,"This is the exact same system as the 20GB and Arcade just with black paint, it still prone to breaking and still is supported by the same terrible customer support as the others. The system has some great titles but with the high failure rate it's just not worth it. I owned 11 of the 20GB's and this system is no better. Everyone should be informed just how bad this system is made and how unreliable both it and Microsoft are. Do a quick internet search for ""broken Xbox 360"" see how many hits you get that all have ligitimate people complaining. Buying one before when this info was a bit more hidden I could understand someone making the mistake but at this point your either just that uninformed, or asking for a problem. The 360 was the worst investment I have made in the last 15 years of my life. Buyer beware!"
1,Do not waste your money on this!,"X box 360 is not worth the money.(1)Internet is not free.Or even comes wireless.(2)It will not last long.(3) Dose not play movies without paying more money on the drive for it.(4) YOu will spend more money on it.Get a PS3 its worth it.(1) Free internet.Wireless(2) So far it has out live Xbox 360.(3) It plays cds,dvds,& Blueray.(4) It saves you money.I would give the xbox 360 0 stars."
1,Unhappy,"I ordered my X-box 360 Elite for a Christmas gift. It was delivered on time, and all was well. Until today, January 8, 2009. It quit working. I have a very unhappy teenager on my hands. What am I to do now?"
4,Better Than The Other Two,"I believe that this ""360"" version was a better buy to begin with. Of course we got the best money could buy when it came out but should my brother have to of sent the first one he bought in to the company so they could send him back a newer version of the same problem? No, I don't think so. The best way to get the ""360"" with the better processor is to check the manufacture date on the box before buying. Your best bet right now is to get the best money can buy with the lastest date. Overall we have not experienced any ""red ring of death"" in our current system but I still don't actually trust the product. Just take my advice and wait awhile and by that I mean a long time because the one we bought from here is still not the one with the processor or motherboard or what have you that this system needs."
1,Xbox 360 LOUD,I bought a Wii not to long ago and it was the greatest! The games are so fun to to play with the next generation motion sensor controls. But the graphics were not that great on the Wii. So I saved up for the Xbox 360 elite and bought it for the hi-def graphics. But when I plugged it in I thought the vaccum was on. This thing is so loud it's ridiculous. The graphics are great but this thing is loud.
2,Be careful!!,"Yes, the Xbox is great fun and has the most advanced online features if it only works... After only 6 weeks of moderate use I experienced the famous ""Red Ring of Death"" and with lots of apologies from Microsoft it took 3 weeks to exchange a brand new one and get a ""refurbished"" one. Unfortunately this refurbished console arrived non-functional (again RROD. So more empathy more apologies, but still I had to send in the console (where MS has a smooth and cost-free system in place, so they must do it quite often) and in an separate shipment at my own cost the power supply (all under warranty). Another 3 weeks and I am still waiting.. So far I paid over a thousand dollar for console and games and it is more time for repair than I ever had for gaming. If you want to risk it, go ahead. It can be lots of fun, but I am done with Microsoft and will get me a Playstation 3."
4,Centerpiece,"My 360 is at the heart of my home theatre system. I stream music from my external HD through my 360 across my surround sound system, am running HiDef to my new flat panel for gaming. I love every bit."
2,"Poor, barely-legible printing","This is an excellent volume, and I'm happy to see it reprinted. The reprint, however, is a poor photo-copy of the original, and on the copy I received, the left-hand pages are barely legible. In fact, one has to guess at what some of the words may be, which is not help in a work like this in which technical details are vitally important. I'm hoping that the publisher may be able to correct the problem, or that this particular volume that I received (and plan to retun) was simply a fluke. MORE CARE, PLEASE, in reprinting old classics!!!"
4,Easy for me,"I bought this product to see if I could build a website for our family. I was suprised at how easy it was to use. There are so many designs and even some specific for what we wanted, our child's birthday party!Now, we use it to post pictures and share the photo album with our relatives and my husband writes his weekly blog about raising our daughter. There are a bunch of extras that come with the product and the best is that Web.com hosts our site as part of the sign up process (free for a year!!!!!).I have a few friends who started their own business recenly and thought these would make good stocking stuffers.Very cool and so easy to use!"
5,Well Worth the Money,"The free domain name and free one-year service makes this bundle a very hot deal.You do not need the software. It is on their web site. The package has a code. You can go to the site to register. You can use their online tools (software), or you can use your own tools to create your sites.You do need some basic skills to create and publish your site. There is no technical support with the package. They charge $15 fee per incident.Just set your expectation right. There is no catch. Everything it promised is real. Worth every penny."
2,Strange...Very Strange....Odd,I find it very strange that all the reviews are either a 1(POOR) or 5 (EXCELLENT) What's the odds that this product is either a ripoff or the greatest thing since slice bread. Strange! Somebody or Someone is not on the up and up. Fake good reviews???????
1,Total Rip-Off,The so-called sofware is nothing more than an advertisement for an online rip-off. There is no program included. You are paying 'money for nothing'. This non-product should be banned and sued out of business. Don't fall for the FAKE 'good' reviews. This is a SCAM!
5,Could not be easier,"Could not be easier to setup, you just point and click your way to adding pictures, content, audio/video files, and all kinds of other stuff. I also like how the content is written in a Word format. And they throw in free advertising through google and yahoo."
5,A Companion,"It has been several years since I read this book and I am about to purchase my second copy ... my first was autographed by the author whom I had the good fortune to meet several years ago in Washington State. The book is a snapshot of the author's life during the years she shared with a very special cat. Hengan is a fascinating woman, and her story about her exploits while accompanied by the esteemed Max Leo is one that will touch the heart and soul of anyone who has ever regarded a cat (or any other animal for that matter) as a faithful friend and true companion."
4,Amazing Book. Must Read,"The author makes the book ""real"". The descriptive words used in this novel makes you get the feelings that the characters in the book feels. Every piece of the book can be painted into a picture. After years and years of agony. The families get split up during the Holocaust. The family reunites together and sharing the adventures they had from moving camps to camps. A scene that I really enjoyed is the scene when the main characters get freed from the death camps and the gas chambers. I enjoyed this book because I like war books, and I recommend this book to people that want a little bit of action and to people that like history. After I read this novel, I realized that people shouldn't be racists or a whole new war might begin."
2,Not so useful,"I was already doing my own Google advertising when I got this book thinking that I will learn a quite a bit of new things from this book. Not so. If you took the time to read Google's own information and FAQ, you would have understood 90% or more of the stuff. I found the screen shots in the book particularly annoying, the prints are so small and are printed in very light colored ink that they are unreadable. You can't read this book without being in front of your computer to follow along each screen to make sense."
2,Buy Perry Marshall's book instead.,"Among this book, Joel Comm's Adsense Code book, and Perry Marshall's Ultimate Guide to Google Adwords, for my money the clearly superior title is Marshall's. This book is fine. But it pales in comparison to Marshall's Ultimate Guide in terms of breath of topics and depth of explanation."
1,Don't waste your money,There is nothing in this book that you can not find by reading the Google AdSense FAQ.
3,Useful Information,"While I found the book useful and inspiring, the author did bounce all over the place and made some strange comments. He even devoted an entire chapter to marketing adult sites, which I thought was a bit strange. Davis wrote at all levels conceptually, theoretically and tactically - which is good. Overall, it's a useful book with good information."
5,Want something different?,I love this. Use it on all cold-cuts. Have given away several bottles because whenever my friends try it they want some.
3,"not an innovator on this recording, by any standard, but good music","Williams is generally exceptional in her delivery & interpretations - but not here, this recording is like 1996's 'Gratitude' album - good but not exceptional! For exceptional check out ;Live at Maybeck Recital Hall, Vol. 21; orEncounters, Vol. 2;orThe Art Of The Piano;orAll Alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Just enough evidence to tell us nothing.,Apparently most of the best evidence is anecdotal. This guy draws conclusions not supported by the facts or the available evidence. The most anyone can say is that we don't know what happens in certain circumstances it certainly doesn't mean that because 1 case study of AIDS people prayed for means there is a god rather than a statistical anomaly. This is sloppy journalism at best. Absolute rubbish.
1,Poorly Written,"In short this book is poorly written. The author does not know how to tell a story or draw a reader in except in the title ""Best Evidence."" He skims through the relevant topics as if he a student trying to fill his word quota. I suggest sticking to Dean Radin's book The Conscious Universe. PS Why does the authors name appear at the top of every page?"
5,"Finally, Science of Psychic instead of Science v. Psychic","""Best Evidence"" is the best compilation of psychic research to date. The author has done a commendable job of sifting through the mountains of pathological or fraudulent claims and flaky New Age fodder that exists in this field to pick out the gems of research that has been conducted at some of the most respected institutions in the nation, as well as by the U.S. Govn't in its Stargate program. Psychic phenomenon have been with us, in the forms that the author studies, in all cultures and throughout all phases of recorded and pre-recorded history. Hopefully, this book will spark a new interest in serious debate and study on these phenomena the author states in his subtitle ""that refuse to disappear"".The reader will want to refer to this book again and again. Its main drawback is that it lacks an index for a quick cross-reference."
2,Great for it's age I guess...,This book smelled awful! I know it was used and knew my friend would love it no matter what. She is a die hard Tom fan! So I did what I could to rid of the smell. Lilac baby powder did help after doing the baking soda in a bag routine. She loved it anyway.
4,Till the END did We part!,"This final installment of the series, gives closure to a lot of things that were left hanging from all the other series the Wies & Hickman team has given us through the years. I am personaly pleased with this end result. The unexpected twists gave me a newly-found respect for this talented team. The book cannot be read as a single volume, eventough it is self-explanatory, it is more than that. It engulfs questions that had been left in mid-air for a LONG time. For now, I believe this masterpiece of Fantasy Literature will improve with a second or third reading. Now that it's over I feel at ease for as they continue thier journeys so shall I but I also feel empty for an era has ended. Farewell companions...in the END I pray we meet again!"
2,Great Story Killed by tired writers,"After reading the Dragon Lance stories for 18 years, I was looking forward to the writers finaly catching Tass & taking his pouches and setting the rest of the world on its way in a fitting, satisfying fasion. An ending that went ""BANG"". What we got was a wimper. The possibilities were there: great evil, great good, people who were well thought out and believable. The opportunity to end Dragon Lance that left the reader wanting to read the whole serries all over again was there, but like a kender, it slipped thru the authors hands.We were left with very little resolved, and the those who sacreficed all the greater good not rewarded in any way. Yes, a few were given some scraps, but the rest?Sorry, either the writers have a follow up set in mind, or they should go back to edit and re-do the final few chapters. Either way, this reader was left feeling like a kender was in my home: respect is missing. Next time, I'll get it from the library."
3,Funny ending,"I think this is a quality series in the Dragonlance canon, but not matching chronocles, legends, or The Soulforge. I found the ending to resolve a lot of issues, but quite ""jarring"" in its sudden presentation and use, once again of magical ""deux au machina"" to resolve all the plot strands. Would have rated it 4 star if not for the jarring ending, but probably you had better read this if you have already got this far."
3,When a great story gets rushed a little too much.,"I understand the need to leave a few open plot points in the trilogy in order to have new books written, that's the way the original Chronicles went after all. However, I don't remember previous trilogies (or the first two books in this trilogy for that matter) having so many moments where you say ""WHAT?"".- Odila has to worship Takhisis, even though she doesn't want to just because she believes that Takhisis exists? WHAT?- Tas breaks the ice wall spell that has the good dragons imprisoned just by running through it. WHAT?- Takhisis needs the dragon totems in order to re-enter the world, only to have it destroyed. Later, Takhisis just shows up to take Mina's body....suddenly not needing anything else....no dragon totems, no dragon portal, no nothing. WHAT?Its a real shame too because I liked the book, even for the plot holes. I even liked it despite the grimness of it."
5,Still stunned by the climatic ending,"If you have even a marginal interest in Dragonlance and have been following the story, buy this book. The book continues the stories of the interesting and vividly detailed main characters, adding to the richness of their personalities and the depth of their feelings. The wonderful and exciting storyline which has become synonymous with dragonlance does not leave readers disappointed in Dragons of a Vanished Moon. The entire book masterfully builds up to the huge climax at the end. Major events occur in rapid succession in the last few chapters making these pages perhaps the most climatic in any dragonlance book. The ending is in true Weis/Hickman fashion and leaves me once again impressed at the skill of these giants of fantasy writing.Bottom Line-Buy it today!!"
5,Dragonlance Forever,As Takhisis is revealed to the heroes things start turning grim.A perfect ending to an imperfect world. This book is great. It ties up all loose ends but leaves a lot of extras for the future. The ending is a shock but not unexpected in such a world. As always Margaret and Tracy deliver. The book is perfectly written with the usual madness of the kenders and the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. Once again these two writers prove that they are Dragonlance and nobody else can step to the plate.
1,Drags on and on and on...,"This series just drags on and on. I wanted it to end, and when it did, the ending wasn't very satisfying. The original 2 series (Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends) were original, entertaining books with characters I could care about, and a story that kept me interested. This seemed to be just a weak attempt to sell a few more books. Too bad, really."
2,An unsatisfactory ending to a great beginning,"The first title in the series was excellent, and the second one continued the mystery and left me anxious for the grand finale. Unfortunately, the finale was much less than grand.After an average intro, the vast majority of the book was simply filler. I got the impression that Mina's conquests were meaningless and the master plan of the new god was really not much of a plan at all. It was a very anti-climactic ending and read like it was rushed to meet a deadline. This book could have been much better if it was at least 300 pages shorter and if the characters developed earlier in the series would have remained true to form."
3,Good- but not up to usual high standard,"The original keepers of the Dragonlance world have certainly 'righted the ship' with the War of Souls trilogy, but even they can never capture the magic that was Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends. I just didn't find the offspring of the original Heroes as compelling as the Heroes themselves. However, this trilogy, and specifically this book, does manage to bring Krynn back to an even keel. Everything is wrapped up neatly. That said, the second book of this trilogy is the best one, and the trilogy itself doesn't measure up to the Legends series, which I hold as the best work in the Dragonlance story line. Read it, but don't expect too much."
3,Well here is the end.....,"Well, if you read the first two books, you will need to read this one to finish up the series, but ... don't expect much from it. It pretty much just wraps everything up, and in my humble opinion, not very well. This is prolly the worst Weis/Hickman work that I've ever read. Please don't get me wrong it is still a good book and I read it in one sitting, but after reading it you will think they could have ended it better, or at least I did. The best thing about the book was a cameo from our favorite character :-D"
2,one of the worst Dragonlance books,If you have read the origial Dragonlance Chronicles you will be disapionted. The current heros have nothing on Heros of the Lance. And the same is true for the villians. Compared to the Chronicles the plot is just about as boring as reading a geometry textbook. If this is your first foray into the world of Dragonlance then please read the Chronicles and forget about this book. This is defenetly not one of Margaret Wies and Tracy Hickman's best(infact it isn't even medioker).
2,Sad & Disappointed,"The entire War of Souls Trilogy was a disappointment. Weis and Hickman have written some wonderful books for the Dragonlance saga, Chronicles, Twins Trilogy...but they really fell apart on this one. If you are a fan of Dragonlance, don't read the final trilogy, it'll make you lose respect for the rest of the books.Why couldn't they just leave Tas dead. Sure, we all love the funny Tas stories and problems the little guy gets himself into...but he's like a meatloaf that has been in the oven too long.In Chronicles, Takhisis inspired awe in the reader, as Tanis fell to his knees in dreadful reverence. In War of Souls she makes you want to bake a cake. Also, what's up with Mina's naive behind. Goldmoon, the woman who raised Mina, hates Takhisis and rejects her ""gift"" yet Mina continues to blindly follow Takhisis.I wish I had never read this trilogy."
1,wish there was a zero star option,"This book was written to correct the disaster that is Dragons of Summer Flame, nothing more nothing less. Funny how those who made Krynn magical were the same ones to utterly destroy it."
2,Disease spreads,"...P>The first 500 pages of 600 was GREAT! I couldn't put the book down. But then, it was like Weis & Hickman got bored. They threw in a few things and ended it. I felt robbed. And most of all angry at the ending.Read the first 500 then skip to the last page, for inbetween is nothing but agony. ..."
2,A let down.,"After reading the first two books in the War of Souls series, I was eagerly awaiting the third and final installment.I should have waited a while longer. At least the feelings of yearning and anticipation I had then was better than the sense of disappointment and loss I have now.Suffice it to say that (without giving away too much) the ending of this series did not follow through on the set up. It was as if they wrote the first book with one ending in mind, then forgot it somewhere along the way and finished the series with another vision.The book feels rushed, as if written at knife point, and beloved characters from the past (Raistlin, the Draconian Doom Brigade, etc) are tossed in without any sense of real purpose or direction.I found myself longing for the end just to get finished. Maybe Weis and Hickman wrote it feeling the same way."
3,What happened?,"Whoa, slow down there. Is this supposed to be Dragonlance?The Chronicles, Legends, Preludes, and Meetings Sextant, along with the other assorted tales, including the first two in the War of Souls, are Dragonlance.This isn't.This book would be better as a stand alone. The moral and story concepts are completely different. Well, almost. But what they really screw up is the storyline. HELLOOO!!! AFTER YOU PUBLISH SOMETHING IT IS PERMANENT!!!! YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR EXPLAINATION IS!!!!Nuff said."
2,Oh How Could You...,"I am a borderline fanatical fan of the Dragonlance series. I have read all of the Dragonlance novels written by Weis and Hickman and I have loved every one (yes even Summer Flame) until now. Dragons of a Vanished Moon simply does not make any sense. It simply jumps around from one plot hole to another providing very little explanation as to why or how. The power of the characters seems to come and go to suit the writer's need to fill those holes. But I read the entire thing hoping to find some sort of satisfaction in the ending only to be extremely let down by the final conflict (if you could call it that). If they write another one I hope they are able to redeem themselves and save Krynn from stupidity, but for now I'll say BOOOOOO!!!!"
2,Dragons of a Half-Hearted Conclusion.,"I loved this book until I got about halfway through. At this point it began to seem hurried and as if many concepts were just hewn together to conclude the series.I felt they had set themselves up wonderfully by mid-book to really shake things up and re-define the world for a new birth of fantasy in the world of Krynn, but all they did was put a stake in the heart of the epic novel. The quality of the writing noticably dropped along with the attention to detail and strength of story. Were the authors rushing to work on something else? It felt like it.I still recommend reading this if you have come this far - however I will be very wary in exploring the works of the dragonlance line of fantasy-fiction further."
5,a perfect conclusion to a great trilogy,Phenomenal reworkings of archtypal and mythic concepts. The plight of the wnadering elves in particular through the desert will rouse empathy in many a reader. And the One god's actions get... more erratic and Mina becomes a more complex character. This is the creme de la crem of Dragonlance.
3,Close but no cigar.,"Weis and Hickman fail to fix the world of Krynn that was totally screwed up in their own Dragons of Summer Flame and numerous other forgettable books written by...authors riding on Weis/Hickman coattails. An optimist may finish this book and say ""Well, it's half-fixed"", but I prefer to consider it ""still broken"". I won't drop any spoilers but lets just say, Weis and Hickman leave more than enough dangling plot lines to enable Wizards of the Coast to flood the market with more Dragonlance books written by the above mentioned...authors such as Jean Rabe. So, if its quantity over quality you want, your world is gonna be a whole lot brighter soon. However, if you yearn for well written, satisfying stories such as the DL Chronicles, DL Legends, & the Legend of Huma, your hunger will go unsated. I hope Wizards of the Coast proves me wrong. We shall see."
2,Dragons Of A Vanished... (whatever)!,"Ok... I'll get to the point-- Palin looses his magic forever, Raistlin does not get to kill Takhisis and the original companions finally all meet up in the afterlife and go off ""adventuring"" again. (Sigh...)"
3,BAD GAME,"This was the first NHL game i've ever owned for my playstation. and now i own NHL Faceoff 2001, which I think is MUCH better. The graphics stink on this game, and the controls are very hard. Even on EASY i can only score a goal per game, when the computer is scoring like 7 or 8. And Im very good at playstation games, i spend like 1/3 of my day on the couch with the controller. (playing, lol). another thing, i bought NHL 97 used from a local store in town, and im very glad i did, because look at the price of a new one here!!! If you have any sense, buy NHL faceoff 2001, its much better."
4,Not Forgotten,"A classic in the genre of Vietnam documentaries. This 1999 film is about American POW airmen, and their ordeal throughout the Vietnam war. What I love about this film is that there is no political angle - these men tell their own stories in their own words, framed by America at the time. No one can walk away from this film and not feel touched."
1,Return With honor,This product was defective when delivered. I returned it for a refund or replacement but never heard squat from the dealer.The production itself however is outstanding and should be seen be everyone.
3,Not flexible,"This boning knife is of good qualifty, but I thought it would be more flexible than it is. The blade is rather stiff just like any other knife blade."
2,i'm just disappointed. that's all i can say.,"Why? Well, it comes down to three reasons:1. It's tippy. Don't put it down without carefully looking where it's going or what angle you're putting it down at. It will fall over. Also, if it's in the same room as a child under 5, it will fall over. Just the mere presence of a toddler or preschool will knock it over.2. It's not a terribly good insulator. Granted, I like to nurse my coffee, but within 30 min or so it's lukewarm. Not good, and this brings me to point #3...3. You can't microwave it! Found this out the hard way. Sparks were involved.The combination of #2 and #3 is a deal breaker, in my mind."
4,Great Art Book for Creative Kids,"I'm a big fan of children creating their own art, without trying to match or copy adult's efforts. Some kids get frustrated when they can't do it ""right.""I like this whimsical book, with its easy-to-follow guides because I think kids are able to mimic the style without feeling like they need to be perfect while doing it.It's a great jumping-off point for little kids who like to sit and work independently. Cute, weird, and funny... I like Ed Emberley's odd take on art."
5,Great Book,If you have a child thats interested in drawling this is a great book..lots of step by step instructions. I bought it for my 9 yr old
5,exactly the book i needed and ordered for class,"exactly the book i needed and ordered for class, well-made, pages could handle lots of erasing, held up well, good CD, good practice problems"
4,Better then most fishing game,"I wish more fishing games would be more like this. It's better then most (or all) current gen-console. The style is one-of-a-kind, with animated pre-render background that looks FANTASTIC and actually makes you feel like you're there. The game only suffers from load time and not enough locations. It's a real gem if you gave the patient to learn the HARD-AS-HELL fishing techniques."
5,Reel Fishing-Soothing therapy for stressed-out adults,"A challenging,yet,not ridiculously hard game to play. It is a soothing, peaceful way to unwind after a very stressful day. Very non-frustrating. Turn of the music, but, leave the nature sounds on. Lock your kids & your spouse out of the room you're playing in, & enjoy a relaxing, peaceful expirence that one would not suspect, could come from a computer game that kids normally use to drive you nuts with. I would reccomend this game to anyone who is high-strung, &, is either on Valium, or, should be on it. It could potentionally replace physciatrists."
5,A real keeper.,Wonderful retelling of classic Russian folk tale. Illustrations are perfect for sharing the story with children. This is a classic for all generations.
2,Not as described,"This item was not as descibed. It was all marked up with magic marker on almost every page and this was not secribed. Poor, poor."
1,Gravity Fails!,"The sound works for Disney intro, but does not work for entire episode. Please fix and would like to know when it works or would like a refund. Please review videos before they are posted to insure proper functionality. I'm really Hesitant to buy any other episodes from Amazon. 1 star because i know it will be fixed."
5,Terrific kids show,"I love watching this with my 9 year-old. The show is simple enough for children, but serves itself up with a subtle tone that resonates with adults, which helps alleviate the soul-crushing awareness that comes with adulthood."
1,Damaged,"I ordered this adorable costume for my daughter's first Halloween. It came in the mail well over a month ago. After opening it and trying it on her for the first time, the top button ripped off. The material is so thin and poorly made that you can not even fix it. The turtle shell is also stained. I emailed the company and they offered to give me a refund since they don't do exchanges. Well that NEVER happened. I have called and they said you will see it on your credit card the next day...NOPE still never happened. I would call back and they would tell me that the person that handles the refunds isn't there. I also emailed again and they never responded. This poorly made costume costs $40.00. I have been buying from Amazon for awhile now and never had a problem until now. I do not recommend this company....VERY POOR QUALITY MERCHANDISE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!"
3,Interesting but disappointing,"This book does show you when you need to consider vision as a problem area for your children. Unfortunately, it mostly just tells you to come see the doctor instead of giving much you can try on your own. I was disappointed as I was hoping to find some exercises or routines that might help. Felt like I paid for an advertisement of this doctor's services."
3,waiting for caller ID,"Be prepared to wait 3 - 4 rings before caller ID appears. That's not acceptable to me.Another negative is the buttons. I always have to check carefully where answer machine button is....and, you cannot retrieve messages from the handsets.Too bad, because sound quality is excellent. Unfortunately, I am again on a phone search."
1,Hated this style phone...,-Nothing really good to say here... -sound quality... -design - durability -everything.The phone we bought long before this still outshines and outperforms this design for us...
5,Excellent balance,I found this book to be a great insight into the artist talents and motivations of graffiti artists. It also gave a view into the law enforcement and priviate property issues. Excellent book!
3,Nice...not thrilling but nice.,"Mike Walsh did this book more as a vehicle to promote his newly aquired design degree than as a graff book. He spent no more than two years researching and taking flicks although most of the graff you see was donated by graff writers and not flicked by Mike himself. This is not a graffiti book. It is a graphic design book which just happens to contain graff in it. It's obvious to a real graff junkie that this book is lacking but to an outsider it's a peek into a different world and that isn't such a bad thing. For those people wanting an in depth look at our culture, read Craig Castleman's book GETTING UP. Now THAT""S a real graff book."
3,"""Graffito"" A journey into art.....","Graffitio is a graphic designz atempt at a graffiti book publication....""Subway Art"",or "" The Art of Getting Over"" are much more informative but this book can be added to a collection of yours...."
2,just getting up,"this book was just a book, i didnt get any literary value from it. just more fliks for the mental, so that aint bad, kinda steep price for pictures tho. figure they have to cover the cost of a glorified scrap book. better book is ""THE ART OF GETTING OVER"". jsut wanted to get internet ups. Disillusioned From Reality. 2000 and on...."
1,Toys will like this,Some guy who has no connection to graffiti tries to play expert. Typical over educated stupidity.
4,Hip-Hop is my religion,"For the record, this is one terrific book. It showcases much graf talent from the perspective of someone who is not a graf artist but appreciates the merit of graffiti-as-art. This is also one of the best showcases of (West Coast) DREAM, who was murdered last week, and whose life was one singlular contribution to graf. DREAM helped to plant the hip-hop art seed in the WC. Forget the politics, and ignore any hater-isms disguised as hip-hop victimization, if you are an artist and can afford $22 bones, get this book."
5,Great place to start,"Too many instructional books make it so you can't see the forest for the trees. Not this one; from the beginning you are given projects that take the time to simply explain the basics of Flash 5 and put them in the simple understanding that Flash 5 really is. You don't simply follow instructions on a page, finish the project and then wonder how and why everyting worked. When you are done with each project you understand the fundamental rules that apply to Flash 5 and how to use them for your own ideas. Buy this book if you want to truly understand Flash5"
3,"Good for beginners, but leaves your with beginner knowledge","When I first received this book, I started my first project. I started getting excited because I was actually creating with flash! That is pretty much where the excitment ends.This book is great for total beginners...which I was...but once you are done with the VERY SIMPLE projects, you really have no more than a beginners knowledge of flash.That is why I am back at it again, trying to find another flash book to help me through my next stage which is putting MY ideas into creation.See, the book didn't really help me learn to do the things I am interested in doing with flash. I don't care how to make a ball roll across the screen...if you know what I mean."
2,A Dissapointment,"This game is nowhere near as good as I expected to be! The graphics are worst, and the game is slower. I thought it was going to be like most other games from 989 sports, but I was sadly mistaken! If you are going to buy a NHL game this year, you may want to look elsewhere!"
1,Horrible!,"I'm sorry to say, but this is a horrible hockey game. I played this game for about a week, then started playing NHL 2000 by EA Sports, and I was amazed by the difference. Even if you like hockey, this game isn't for you...The graphics aren't very good, and one really annoying thing is the replays- they are very bad graphically, and you can barely see anything. If you want a hockey game, try NHL 2000- it's by far the best. Do not buy this game, or you'll be using it as a shooting target for your hockey net!"
1,"Almost ""Glorified Pong""","Although very close to finally hitting that winning formula, FaceOff falls just short once again. There's really not that much missing from the game: all the teams and players are there, animations are decent, the control and physics models are reasonable as well. The problem with FaceOff is that is simply isn't fun. The AI is simply pathetic and often falls into the same boring patterns, forcing you to do the same offensive things every time or sumbit to the defense. It simply turns boring within a few minutes, even for a die-hard hockey fan like myself! Losing the atmoshpere and feel of the game hurts FaceOff so much it comes dangerously close to the ""glorified Pong"" range."
4,NHL Faceoff 2000,"This game in my opinion has it all from the different camera angles, authenic stadium sound affects like the big organ horn in Chicago to the Coyotes howl in Phoenix aftew a goal is score how more authenic can you get. I'm a huge hockey fan, actually purchased all the 2000 hockey games this season and this one is my favorite. The players skate so effortlessly actually feel like they are gliding, the checks are devastating and the commentary is excellent even with voice inflections on breakaways or huge stops. The only fault is the graphics compare to NHL 2000 or Fox NHL are a little choppy not as crisp, but it makes up with it's outstanding game play You can play all the teams in this game also during a season mode and pick what jersey your team will suit up in. If you only want to buy one game this year, not like me who own all three this would be my choice. I actually sold NHL 2000 to a friend my least favorite of the 3."
3,NHL Faceoff 2000 is better....but,"The game is very entertaining. However, I have found that at certain times the play by play calls incorrect names for players and does not pronounce certain Team names correctly. Instead of Philadelphia the game says adelphia. The all-star level is too easy. Overall it is an improvement from the 99 version."
3,Medicore,"This game was just allright. I was expecting more teams and more options, such as a pelanty shot section and secret codes. The best assest of the game is that it is very fast paced. They could have done much more w/ it though."
3,"Comprehensive, not well organized, occassionally redundant","Summary pretty much sums it up. It was very comprehensive, but not well organized. It had similar material spread out. More tables would have helped. Also, certain key words were not bolded or included in the chapter end in the keywords section. Instead of CD it had a floppy disk which I actually considered an advantage because the sample test files were text files which could be printed for easier study and access. The sample test did not always give complete answers however. The graphics were pretty good but not thorough enough. The index needs to be more thorough also, but was adequate. The chapter quizes were good, but too simplistic for doing any good on the certification. It was about the best book on the market unfortunately."
4,Straight-forward answers,"This was a very comprehensive book. It was easy to follow and the answers to the chapter reviews were easy to pull from the chapter. I did not have to read, and reread, and reread the chapter looking for a non-existent answer, as I have had to do in some books in the MCSE track. I only wish the textbooks that are being used at my school were all written by this author."
1,1 would save my money,"I think this is one of the worst computer text book I had the miss-pleasure to read in my 25 years as a computer professional.Some specifics: The book is biased towards presenting and supporting Microsoft interests. Historical facts are either left out to present a rosier picture for Microsoft, or the writer is outright incompetent. Important information / or that will correctly answer questions at the end of each chapter is buried within a verbose style that will put even the most diligent among us to sleep. In all honesty I can say that I found only two pages of the 640 that held my interest (397-398), and those had nothing to do with Microsoft or the NT 4.0 server."
1,yuk.,One of the worst. . . a big waste of your time. We convinced our dept. to drop both this book and Ed Tittel's.
2,unhappy,the product was here quick but the blade was bent at the tip and the sheath was broke. i am not happy with it.
3,Great for the city,"I wear this knife if I am going to the big city. I just feel more secure with this around my neck and mySOG Specialty Knives & Tools M46 Topo Meridianin my pocket. It is a fairly decent knife for the cost (about $10 with shipping), though the blade is only slanted on one side. It is completely flat on the side that is not shown in the picture. As the description of the knife states, it is very light weight and fits very firmly in the sheath. This knife goes very well under a shirt or sweater, and is not noticeable if several items of clothing are worn above it. The knife comes fairly sharp, though it does not hold an edge at all compared to my SOG.TL;DRIf you are on a budget and need something for self defense, then this knife is for you."
2,Left Handed -.-,"It came great, a few days is a ll it took for me to get this product, the only problem I didn't really notice until now was that it's a left handed knife....I mean, come on, they should have options when selling this, not just sell it left handed only! I looked up other websites that sell the same exact product and theirs are right handed, same name same exact knife but RIGHT handed, and Amazon only sells em left, unless you buy the S&W for 10 more bucks plus s+h. I'd give it more stars, but that left-handed issue really just got on my nerves. I can still grip it....to a certain extent, uncomfortable as hell but it was cheap so I guess I can't expect much for what I paid."
5,Awesome,I bought this for my girlfriend. Not only does it have a convenient knife at her disposal but also a rape whistle!
1,dont..,i bought this same knife at a shop same brand same style. its the budk knife. three dollars on the actual site. mine snapped when i threw it the first time. not a durable knife at all..
1,Only one side sharpened?,"I am giving two stars because either they forgot to grind one of the sides, or because this is a left handed only knife and they did not put it in the product discription. I am not left handed so I can not use it!**Update** I wish I could give zero stars for this, worst possible option for a neck knife, totally and completely useless!"
1,A dull toy,"No one in their right mind would depend on this knife. The only good use would be to open mail, but you will need to sharpen it first."
3,OK for the money,Needs some sharpening work. It has a silly whistle built into the front of the plastic scabbard which I will grind off and attach some kind of belt clip or MOLLE arrangement. I may keep it as a neck knife but will attach a lanyard for anti-snag protection and perhaps some stealth? We'll see how it works....
3,Decent Inexpensive Knife.,"This knife was is a little bigger than I expected it to be. It's just under 7 inches with a 3 inch blade. Being flat on one side(see pic) and roughly made, it's the cheapest looking knife out of the six I bought from BUDK but for a price of $3 I shouldn't complain. This is knife gives some if you try to flex it. Basically it's a cheap Chinese made knife that you can treat like heck or just keep in a pack and not care if you loose it or bust it. It is not high quality steel. It's purpose is self defense. It is not a throwing knife. It clicks into the sheath decently. I wish the sheath had a belt/boot clip rather than a a cord. And FYI, BUDK is fast to respond and resolve any issues you have."
2,Ok but wouldnt buy again,"Kinda cheap feeling and the single edge blade is a nightmare, hard to cut anything. The end of the case already cracked a little."
2,Meh,"Medium quality, bulky, and much cheaper off of budk.com also the blade is crap, though it is kind of a novelty knife"
2,It sure is pointy,"Cons-It doesn't retain an edgeIt doesn't get very sharpThe handle is somewhat uncomfortable.The blade is only shaped on one side, the other side is flat.It's made from cheap Chinese steelPros-It's made of metalIt's pointyIt comes with a sheathIt's $4"
2,Pretty disappointed,"I recieved the item with paint already chipping off the blade, it has no weight to it at all, the edge has an odd shape and the whistle on the sheath doesnt even work. This knife offers nothing i wouldnt get from any other pocket knife, add that to the fact its cheaply made: ill stick with something else"
2,Shitty knife,The knife is not as big as they say it is and it's not sharp and the handles came off almost instantly
4,Good,Wasn't very sharp but i have a knife sharpener so it wasn't a big deal. Great for joggers and whatnot.
4,I liked it.,"Kind of small, but I can dig it. I wish the sheath didn't have a whistle built in......But it's alright."
2,Not quite what they seem,The gloves are more like heavy yarn made with microfiber. The pair I received had several holes where the finger meet.
5,Excellent product,"Very well made and attractive case. Even with the shipping included, it was less expensive than the lower quality cases available from my local retailers."
5,The techniques work. Make them part of your everyday life and you will have results.,"This book is probably the most important book I have read som far. The ideas and theories are intresting but that's not the reason for it's importance. It's the fusion of Reichian* Techniques, Yoga, and tantra. Reich's techniques are, from my point of view, by far the most important component. If you want to become a happier and more harmonious person, read this book and get to work.Note: there are more detailed descriptions of Reich's work on the net.* Wilhelm Reich (March 24, 1897 - November 3, 1957) Austrian-American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst."
4,An eye opener for those who haven't alot of work experience,Garson has produced an interesting work which revolves around her research and interviews of workers engaged in some rather unusual but boring occupations.
3,Queen reigns,"As an Aretha aficionado, I enjoy 99.9% of everything she does. Girlfriend could sing the phone book to me and I'd be thrilled. This Holiday collection is nice...not all songs are related to the Season. Her duet with Mavis Staples is excellent and of course her Winter Wonderland is a classic. If anyone wants something a little different for the Holidays, this could be a nice CD as an alternative to what's on your normal playlist."
2,Odd compilation,"This is a very strange album. I've always been a very big fan of Aretha's work on Columbia Records. If they had kept this album to her early '60s input for the lable, I would have probably cherished the compliation for the best you could get from the era.But half of the album is from her '70s and '90s gospel albums for Arista (since those masters are now owned by Sony/Columbia). What we're left with is a curious mash-up of two distinctly different styles. I don't think fans of her early '60s material OR her Gospel period would find this disc satisfying at all. Maybe someone should've released two differen EPs and allowed the fans to pick up the CD from the era they like best.As it stands, to my ears nothing comes together. It therefore makes her newest ""This Christmas"" album (even though it sure doesn't have THESE vocals) the preferable choice."
5,Queen of Soul Christmas,"Aretha, is just the best. I love her vocal inflections. She just breathes and the magic is there."
2,Not really what I expected,"Hey, this is Aretha Franklin! Therefore, I was expecting to hear better musical arrangements on a few of the ordinary songs so she could 'belt it out'! Not so on this cd. Unfortunately, this was a let down. Other than the beautiful spiritual hymns, Aretha's delivery is just ordinary.Sorry Ree, but it's the truth in my opinon."
5,Does the job,"Hey, what can you say? This item is not exotic nor exciting; it just does what it's supposed to do. What more can you ask?"
4,Small is Still Beautiful by Joseph Pearce Small is Still Beautiful: Economics as if Families Mattered,"Joseph Pearce gives us a very helpful book that covers such topics as: philosophy of economics, critiques of capitalism, socialism and communism, the abuse of land and historical examples that both support the ideas he is proposing and affirm the criticisms he is making. The book, to its credit and as the title implies, leans very heavily on E.F. Schumacher's ""Small is Beautiful."" It has introduced me several new ideas and, I think Pearce would accept this, offers a very nice introduction to economic philosophy of distributism."
3,"Good Background, but little new to offer over the original","I had hoped that this really filled in a lot of gaps from the original Schumacher book, ""Small is Beautiful"". Still, it is clearly written with enough basic economic information that you will still get Schumacher's main points with some updated references. I would definately recommend reading Schumacher's book first, then ""Whatever happened to penny candy"" or if you are more studious, you will be well rewarded for reading Griffin's ""The creature from Jekyll Island"" explaining the origins of our current lawless state of economics that has profited the wealthy bankers and put our nation into a perpetual state of indebtedness, which has now infected the congress, senate, and corporations to epidemic levels."
4,I love Kenny G's Holiday Music,"I have several of Kenny G's Holiday Music cd's. I enjoy Christmas Music, but not the annoying voices that go along with it. This and his other holiday albums allow me to enjoy some Christmas music. Very soothing to listen to."
5,"John Wayne, tough and sensitive, too","I just ordered and read this book, and I found Aissa to be very forthcoming about her years with her father, the Duke. I get the impression that John Wayne tried very hard to be a good parent. Like all parents and human beings, he had some short-comings, but he seemed to adore his children and wanted the best for them. What can be better than that? Every once in a while she tends to whine about her circumstances, but then she recovers and shares some wonderful memories about life at home with her father. John Wayne was tough and gutsy, but he allowed himself to be vulnerable around his family. I think more of him now than I did before. Aissa still seems lost without her father, which makes perfect sense to me. What a loss."
1,Wrong title for this book,"This book is a total dissappointment. It should have been titled ""Aissa the daughter of John Wayne"" as it is more about her than her father."
1,Disappointed,Aissa Wayne (the author of this book and daughter of John Wanye)wines and complains thoughout the whole book. Making this very disappointing if you were hoping to read some good stories of John Wayne behind the camera.
3,Slight surface rust McGard 84520,"When I received McGard 84520 (Chrome Lug Nut and Valve Stem Package with Locking Lug Nuts.) it appeared to be OK. Upon opening the package for installation I noticed some slight surface rust. I installed anyway because I needed the nuts to install my different wheels. I have had McGard Tough nuts before and was very happy with them. This time not so happy. Don't know if they came from a flood area or what. Hope this doesn't happen often to others who order from Amazon.com like I did. Sincerely, Frank"
2,Meh,"Item arrived well packaged and intact, and basically as described, but it's nothing special. The silver rod is plastic, not metal, which really cheapens it. The plates look nice, but are not bone china. Easy to assemble. I'm much happier with the quality of another similar 3-tiered plate with metal rod, that I bought from HomeGoods. Also I find this a little small and not that versatile."
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my kitchen so I can organize a place to put my tomatoes, lemons, potatoes, etc., and it works perfectly! It is just as it appears in the picture. I am well pleased and would recommend it."
4,nice track light for the price,"I bought 2 of these to Amazon. They appear nicer in the picture shown. Quality is medium to poor, but Hey!, for the price, they're nice"
3,"If you want ""War of the Worlds"" ...","Look for ""The Complete War of The Worlds"" by Brian Holmsten in Amazon's book section. It has the complete magazine serial with original illustrations, the complete Orson Welles script, plus a CD with the Orson Welles program and conversation between HG Wells and Orson Welles."
3,STONE,"I'm a big fan of biker movies, so trying not to be too bias I'd have togive Stone a three star. It has everything a good biker movie needs-cheezie acting, off the wall plots & sleezie characters. But to my surprize my wife actually said she liked this one."
4,Spiffy Small Travel Book,Even though every Star Trek fan knows almost all the trivia information in this book it is a nice filler. If you're going to roleplay in the Star Trek universe it provides a good background for location hopping on alien worlds.
2,Meager,"It's a thin and inexpensive book, but I still would have expected more from it. The Travel Guide presents nothing more than some well-known trivia. Although it is not ""canon"" anyway, it doesn't try to make the touristic Star Trek Universe a bit more diverse. The images in the book are not of very high quality either."
1,Fun at first...,My first system was a playstation. This was my first game. I loved it for about 2 or 3 years. But now that I have played PS2 Gamecube and Xbox this game is extremely awful. The grafics are just HORRIBLE! Would not recommed in any circomestance.
4,In Old Hollywood,"I enjoyed reading this biography about one of my favorite movie people, Irving Thalberg, the boy genius of MGM. I was able to learn about his relationship with Lois B. Mayer, how he worked his way up in the business and how he shaped the careers of many Hollywood stars.Bob Thomas gives us an insight into the Hollywood of the 20s and 30s. The pictures of Irving Thalberg with, among others, Norma Shearer, are really good. I liked being able to take a look at Thalberg's office, since I had often wondered what that looked like.Most people thought very well of Irving Thalberg and were sad when he died young, at the age of 37. This, I think, is a rarity in Hollywood. The man deserved a longer life."
5,Very satisfied,Future Weapons season 2 is a very informative documentary. It talks aboutthe various types of future weapons that are being developed around the globe. I was very happy with the shipping time that it took. A little over a week which is very fast for the location that I'm at.
5,Great info....,The sections on small arms are particularly interesting. Well done series. Can't beat the price. I can't wait until Season 3 comes out!
1,It did not help me,"I am recently introduced to yodeling and want to learn to yodel. This is the first tape I bought to try to learn and I was not helped by it at all, and think it is way, way, overpriced, for what it is.I would not recommend it. I found more instruction on you tube by yodelers teaching to yodel, which was much more instructional and diverse than this was, but I did not know that the youtube yodel instructions were better,until after I received this CD.The tape is mostly Mt Christensen yodeling songs, with some very basic sounds that he does not slow down to instruct how to make them, and they are not clear enough to pick up. A video may help show how to form the syllables, but this is way too little, for way too much."
4,"If You Gotta Yodel, This is the Way to Go!","This is a great way to get started yodeling. If you really work at it, you will learn the secret joy and tranquility that comes with the territory. But be forewarned: it doesn't come easy, and in your early efforts, work at it some place in private. Your friends and loved ones will appreciate it. Come out in public when you can make some good music. And if you can make yodel music as good as this guy, I want to hear it!"
4,good for the price,"this tanto is a good product for the price. it has good balance and full metal through the hilt. the only thing i didn't like was the sheath, but that is easy to change."
4,Basic Good Fun,"RC2 is a fun way to go off road. Race against the computer to win new tracks and cars, then customize them with a new paint job and go have some fun. Race against friends in the two player split sceen mode or against the computer in single player mode, either way this game is fun for all ages."
4,It's fun if you like PS1 games and racing.,"So the one I got didn't have the proper case or booklet. In fact, it came in a little square paper envelope. If you want everything including the game, get it new. If you don't care, get it used. It's the same game. It's a good racer for the PlayStation. All the vehicles turn really sharp, but you adapt quickly. Plus you can create your own race course with different themes. You can even edit main and trim colors on your rally cross vehicle."
5,Easy and long-lasting bulb,"I needed a security light for my backyard, so I purchased one of these. It was easy to set up (I'm a non-mechanical girl) and the bulb has burned every night about 12 hrs a night for the last 4 1/2 months straight, so the bulbs last a long time.It's been out in the snow and rain with no problem!"
1,Very Dangerous Product (more like 0 star rating),"Exactly, don't even touch this rubbish, I simply tried to resize a partition and it totally stuffed up my Win XP Pro system. I am 3 days in now and trying to recover/rebuild my boot files and it has been next to impossible, I have now resorted to using ERD Commander (fantastic product) to simply recover my files and it will be easier now to reinstall everything. It totally changes something, I think makes major changes to boot and registry files and if your system has a user password, you'll have a hard time trying to recover anything. Microsoft are a bunch of unhelpful idiots with their support or tech notes, as if there are speaking nerd language."
1,Not a good product,"I purchased PC 8 as its blurb said it was capable of converting Dynamic disks to Basic disks. This it did OK, but when I attempted to repartition a drive with Win XP freshly installed, it crashed while attempting to verify the repartitioned disk. Have not been able to recover thus far-- very disappointing1"
1,not any good,"The product installed ok. but after I added more memory to my C: drive,it would not let me boot up my OS. I call there tech suportand after being on the phone for almost an hour, being put on hold at times they could not figure out the problem.I think I going to have to use the recovery disk which means I must start all over, It's just not worth it. I am asking for my money back just for all the time I have wasted with it."
2,Few are alright others well....,It can give you ideas to get you started. But I didn't find all of the books acceptable or even that usable. Maybe some of the shorter books would work better in a one on one or smaller group situation.
1,Was Unable to use this with my 6 yr old,"I purchased this to use with my 6 year old. So far, Madeline has been the only book that my child was interested in. I've had about 10 of the suggested books flop. My child just was not interested in the content of the book or the ideas in the curriculum were to complicated.I've tried everything I can think of in attempt to make this curriculum work with my family. So far, nothing has worked. I'm at the end of trying with this curriculum and ready to try something that will work."
2,In a word: Boring,"There isn't enough variation in his style... and where are all these effects they mention in the description? (He has his pedals out there but never seems to ""activate"" them.)The timber of his sound is the same in every piece and he doesn't have any defined articulation in the right hand. It's a soft, sloppy thumbing in every song (although it sounds okay in the slow strumming parts).I want music with more defined phrasing. (This is mostly aimless noodling.) Any definitive phrasing he offers is constantly sequenced in descending whole-steps with exact replication (boring).The video editing is WAY too active. It distracts from the music. Ease off on the fly-by camera shots! This music is way too mellow for all that camera activity!I was hoping for more from this video... oh well."
4,Orignal Soul. The tilte says it all!,"Orignal Soul is Grace Potters first album and a very worthy one. I first discoverd Grace with her most current self titled album GP&N. It is a great classic rock album! However Orginal Soul is very heart felt soul music with an occansional hint of blues. All the songs are very well written, ( she is a great lyricist ) and recorded with a clean and smooth sound. My favorite tracks are in this order: 1. Hidden Superstion, 2. Gumbo Moon, 3. No Good, Mean Old, Lowdown Lover Man, 4. At your Request. If your only a classic rock fan, then you might not be into this album, but if your a hard core Potter fan then adding this album to your a collection is a must!! Note: This album is hard to find, so if you do, it might cost a lot more than the orignal retail price."
3,Well titled debut.,"For all the Vermonters out there, I recently checked-out this album from the Jericho-Underhill library. I say that because I doubt any level of fan wants to buy this for the outrageous going used price of 200+. That's right people, don't forget your local libraries.Musically I enjoyed Original Soul. It's far from the rock n roll of the self-titled album. A lot more...soul. Grace already sings very well, and she gives the organ plenty of attention (sorry, had to). There was no doubt growth from album to album, but this is still very worthy of a listen, especially if you like the softer side of our favorite Vermont girl."
1,Unremarkable Article,"The article mentions some of the impact triggered in 2004 by the resignation from the World Economic Forum (under accusations of corruption) of Jose Maria Figueres, ex-president of Costa Rica. As the third Costa Rican ex-president since 1990 to embarrass the nation related to corruption (Rafael Angel Calderon and Miguel Angel Rodriquez being the others) the article asserts that Costa Rica's reputation for good government was all but destroyed and the people disillusioned. There was very little to learn from this article."
2,A Bunch of BOLOGNA!,"""Grant Antrews"" is living on some other planet. This book is every submissive man's fantasy--and FANTASY is exactly what it is! The reality of female domination is much different than what he portrays--take it from a dominatrix herself. Even the cover is degrading (why would a ""FEMDOM"" book feature a woman in BONDAGE! ) Ugh. Mr. Antrews is a decent writer--this book is just an unbelievable, over-the-top piece of work. Read it as an escape from the REAL WORLD."
3,Interesting but sad.,"The novel begins with so much promise -- we will follow a man on his journey into the femdom world. We see a couple explore their relationship on various levels, all the time the two seem to be in love. But there is also the udnercurrent that somehow the femdom is not quite all together in this novel and are left with a disappointing ending to a promising story."
4,One of two erotic books that has impacted my perspective.,"This book is one of two erotic books that changed my sexual perspectives. The first was Story of O. This one, because Grant Antrews brought warmth, caring, love, and concern to a highly charged and erotic relationship between a man and a dominatrix. It is a ""love story"" of profound impact and I related to its devotionalist theme."
2,My Darling Submissive,"As a Dominatrix, I found the Female Dominant in this book weak and unrealistic. This is truly about a submissive man's fantasy. The main character ""Lady Jane"" is more submissive than dominant. Her character in strong in the beginning of the book but turns weak and needy as the story progresses. Ned Ramsdell, (the supposed submissive) seems to be the dominant, wise and strong one. The ending is very sad and disappointing. So disappointing that I wish I never read it in the first place.If this story was written as Jane being the submissive and Ned the Dominant.......................It would be a better story.A true let down for those who truly practice the BDSM and D & S lifestyle."
1,Boring,"The woman is not even powerful she's a child always crying. The author goes on to descirbe everthing in complete detail and I mean everything her couch, rug, hair, the day, her dress it was all just to much and too long. There is no real domination its just a man who fell in love thats all, nothing else."
4,Current Nepalese cooking possible with American ingrediants.,"I like this book especially for the straight-forward simplicity of the recipes and, especially, for the great tasting food.It is good for both vegetarians and omnivores!Several cooks contributed so the cook gets a variety of styles, probably from different parts of the american Nepalese society."
4,Yum!,"I actually bought this book in Nepal after serving for 2 yrs there as a Peace Corps Volunteer. I knew I'd get a hankering for some home cooked Nepali specialties once I got home. I haven't made the majority of the recipes in it, but it was certainly worth the cost of the book for the ones I have made, especially the spicy fried pork cubes which I make quite often. Kasto meetho lagyo!"
2,"basic, simple and easy cooking - but no pictures !",I thought this cookbook was quite good. It is the only one I have found as it is difficult to get anything about Nepalese cooking... so I am not looking a gift horse in the mouth BUT... I do wish it had a better format especially some pictures.
2,Uneven and not the best option for any of the 3 countries,"It seems likely that the reason people buy this book is simply because it's Lonely Planet and because the much better travel guide options for individual countries don't seem to pop up easily when you search this site. However it's worth persevering. For Georgia the Roger Rosen book ""Georgia: A Sovereign Country of the Caucasus"" is good on architecture and photos, but Tim Burford's recently updated Bradt Guide is more practical. For Azerbaijan Mark Elliott's Azerbaijan with Georgia book (Trailblazer) gets great reviews (see also Amazon.co.uk) but for some reason is hidden around 75th when you search Amazon.com with the key word Azerbaijan. It has about 140 maps and loads of practical detail. For Armenia the best resource is altogether free (Rediscover Armenia Guidebook - download in sections from [website]) though you can buy the whole thing pre printed via Amazon or in situ."
2,Out dated information,Lonely Planet fumbled on this one...much of the information is out dated. The Armenia and Karabagh sections are particularly weak. There are more comprehensive books for this region with better maps and business information. Try again LP.
2,"Nice packaging, but lots of errors","The guide is well packaged, and is easy to use. One won't have difficulty locating information on, say, visas, or local foods. But the book reads as if it was written by several different people who didn't review each other's notes. There's contradictory information, and much of the data for Armenia is wrong. They have the wrong telephone area code for Yerevan, Armenia, for example. They suggest trying restaurants that are in fact closed. I guess it's not bad for a first try, but I was disappointed."
1,Feeble,"Knowing that I would be in Armenia for a week's time, I bought this to take along (in spite of the warning reviews I had read from other readers)as there seemed nothing else. Now that I think of it, this book, at least the Armenian section, added little; much was inaccurate or wrong (NW never has flown there, nor KLM). Fine new hotels like the Hotel Yerevan are not even listed. The scant 3-paragraph on the Armenian Church is superficial, silly and condescending (suggesting pagan customs and ignoring the gallant witness of 1,700 years). In both Georgia and Armenia, the Church is a major factor and cannot be dismissed in 3 casual paragraphs."
1,Another dent in LP's reputation,"Very poor from start to finish ! The last 10 years LP has published several very average books. I used to like LP a lot but I now prefer Rough Guide, Trailblazer or Footprint. I think LP's main mistake with this book was that they wanted to publish a guide to this region at all costs, just to fill the blank spots on their world map. How were these authors selected ? Many would do a better job. LP books used to be written by fellow travellers who knew what other travellers were looking for when travelling. Why are there e.g. so few (cheap)hotels listed ? I found an affordable place to stay in every town I visited. With a little bit of effort, the practical information would have been much better. Leave this book at home, better buy Mark Elliot's book for Azerbaijan (and Georgia) or the Bradt guide to Georgia (Burford) or consult Raffi Kojian's excellent website for Armenia."
2,very pro-armenian,"this is a nice book for foreigners, but very pro-armenian in every issue concerning Azerbaijan and it's territorial integrity."
2,To Kakha Khizanishvili,"First, ""unexistent"" is not a word. Additionally, I am flattered that you would consider reading Armenian and Georgian history--and of course you did not. Neither did you read your own history. If you did, you would discover that every inch of your land was once other nation's empires; as a result, all art and architecture that is claimed to be ""Turkish"" is, in fact, either Armenian, Greek, Assyrian, and/or Arabic."
3,to Mr. Meneshian,"Dear Mr. MeneshianBe careful when writing reviews. Unfortunately, you are ignorant about the fact that there is no Armenian Region of Nagorno Karabakh. For more information look at the official maps. You probably have no idea about other conventional maps, but the map of the ""Great Armenia"" on your wall.Thank you"
1,Didn't even work,I bought this charger to work with me ipod touch and it didn't even work.. Waste of a purchase..
1,junk,"the first time I used it the auto adapter came apart. turns out the plastic was broken when I recieved it.would have returned it, but shipping cost was more than item cost."
5,Outstanding,"Perfect fit and functionality. Exactly like OEM part and was easier to install then expected. I'm a big DIY and when I can locate the part and install; I recognize the HUGE savings I'm achieving. On the rule of thumb of labor costing 2-3 times material, it doesn't take long to realize you're making your finances go further. Hmmmm, now if I could only get the local, state and federal government to think that way. Way to go Dorman and Amazon! Excellent teamwork!"
1,REV,THE ACTUATOR DID NOT WORK AND WHEN I WENT TO TAKE IT OFF IT CAME APPART THERE RENDERING IT UN-RETURNABLE
1,Horrible Customer Service,I order this service plan 5 of July and still have not recieved it until this day. Would never consider ever buying anything from NEW again.
3,amazon credit card application for zero interest is a rip-off,"The advetized zero percent on your visa application is a total rip off as they do NOT tell you you cannot cancel if you are not instantly approved. NO ONE IS. I applied with a 740 credit score......After they did not instantly approve me, I was told I could NOT use another credit card, and I had to wait until they sent me the reply through the MAIL, and NOT e-mail. This is ridiculous that one cannot say FORGET IT. I will never purchase from amazon again."
3,Hopefully I won't need it..,"Tough to review something unless you require its services, so far I have not. I hope if/when I do need it it was worth the money."
5,Great Price!!!!,This service is pretty good and it is a good price for a 4 year plan for everything covered.In short my tv is protected for the next 4 years
3,check your credit card extended warranty coverage first,"Many visa cards will double your manufacturer's warranty. Visa will also sell you extended warranties.For example, say a $2,001 item with a one year warranty. Visa will extend it to two years for free.They also offer extended warranties. In this case, 3 years for $166, 5 years for $268. Much better than the $300 for 2 yrs. $500 that only 4 years this vendor offers.As to the quality of the coverage, I can't really speak to that. It comes down to the fine print and how willing they are to pay the claims, which is hard to tell up front in either case."
1,Replacement Bulbs NOT Covered,"The ""bulbs"" refer to replacement blubs for LCD and DLP HDTVs.I was looking at this service plan and this is what is written in the terms and conditions PDF:WHAT IS NOT COVERED: . . .(8) ACCESSORIES AND SUPPLIES, INCLUDING: BATTERIES, ANTENNAS, CARTRIDGES, STYLUSES, RECORDS, AUDIO/VIDEO DISKS, TAPES, COMPUTER SOFTWARE OR DISKS, PRINT ELEMENTS, EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLIES, BULBS, SPARK PLUGS OR FILTERSOther service plans (Circuit City) cover one bulb which makes buying the service plan worth while. Not here."
5,Simply Works,"This product simply works. It tells you want it's going to do and it does it. I got Niacin (250mg) because I heard it could decrease acne by improving blood flow, flush out toxins, etc. I believe this has contributed not only to my decrease in acne, but also has improved my overall health. Sure the Niacin flush is somewhat uncomfortable, but the benefits outweigh any risks or annoyance from this product. I will re-order again once my supply is low."
1,Warning: Do not buy this staff !,"I took this for the first time last night, and after about 20 minutes I felt some burning around my neck that started to continue all over my body. my whole body felt like after a sever sunburn.It was very scary, I have not noticed the warning. I have consumed before Niacin 100mg and everything was fine. So I was not expecting this phenomena. I tried to call the clinic and even thought to go to hospital. after an hour I have started to cool down literally ! It is not worth it. I also noticed the warning after checking the bottle the next day after it happen to me again.So I am not using it anymore. Do not buy this stuff!"
2,Omega are good watches for the first 3 years,"After the first 3 years you have to pay for everything incluiding the regular maintenance, totally different with the service of the Rolex you did not have to pay nothing.When I bougth this watch they prommised that the coaxial system was the best in the market, that not true. I have to pay 300.00 USD for the first mainteinance of the watch.Prefer Rolex or Panarei."
5,Gorgeous,wow! That was wut I said when I got them. Better than I imagine. A bit small but I think I can overcome.
3,Not Quite a Grissom,This was my first Iles book. Its rather entertaining though I did find that the loose ends were too nicely tied up at the end. The courtroom part were he is pitted against a former girlfriend was way too Hollywood for my tastes. But it warrants 3 stars because I did find myself wanting to keep reading.
2,What a disappointment,"A ""thriller"" like this depends on surprises--too bad this book had none. (Among other things, I knew exactly who the big ""surprise"" witness would be, and what evidence would be presented.) When you add in the flat characters, cliches, and overwrought emotions, this was a real dud.The Natchez setting was the only saving grace. ....."
4,legal thriller meets suspense thriller,"Greg Iles is a brilliant writer.His best book is Mortal Fear. This book is not his best book. The story is that of a widower and his daughter who go back home to the deep south to spend some time with their family. Then, everything goes wrong. A conspiracy plot rivaling that of the Kennedy killing unravels at times convincingly. Some of the characters ring true. Some are hard to believe in and that slows what otherwise would have been another five star Iles into a four star good book with some imperfections.This is certainly a good book, but it just isn't his best."
4,Great Summer Reading,"I'm an avid reader and I loved this book but then I love Natchez. The fact that Iles is the son of a Doctor from Natchez just makes the book that much more interesting. If you enjoy John Grisham's books and you like novels about the south, then you will like this book."
5,Great Detail,"Out of all the Greg Iles books I've read so far, this one is definitely my favorite. The richness of the detail far outweigh his other books and really take you to the heart of the story. If you could only pick one Greg Iles book to read, this one should be it!"
3,"Well-written and exciting, but...","Recently widowed prosecutor-turned-novelist Penn Gage returns to his hometown of Natchez, MI seeking peace for himself and his young daughter. However, he finds his parents troubled by the aftermath of events from years ago, and becomes embroiled in the mystery of a 30-year-old racial murder and the subsequent cover-up. The web of secrecy includes episodes from his own past and extends into local power politics and even the upper echelons of the FBI. There is lots of action to keep you turning the pages, and as the political and legal maneuverings unfold, so do the characters&#65533; innermost secrets. However, the characterizations are clichéd, the plot fizzles out at the end, and I found it hard to feel much sympathy for a bereaved main character who places his daughter&#65533;s life in danger to resolve unfinished business with his high school sweetheart."
4,Predictable,"I like Greg Iles as an author & I believe his writing saved this book, which is very predictable.A black man is murdered in the South back in '68. No one pays the price & all is swept under the carpet. Not much of a surprise there.There are a few twists along the way, including J. Edgar Hoover's involvement, as well as the happenings of a lost love. Our hero, Penn Cage, champions the cause to unravel the cover-up & come up with the truth.The story is very well narrated by Mr. Iles. It's descriptive & good; albeit a bit long. What I found a bit tiring was Penn's somewhat schoolboy yearning over his long lost love Olivia. Especially after she puts the screws to him in favor of her dastardly father. Get over it Penn & smell the coffee"
5,"Defines "" Page Turner""","This novel has it all. Interesting characters, plot, mystery ,unexpected turns, good guys, bad guys, etc.Unqualified recommendation for escapist reading."
5,Another great Greg Iles read,"THE QUIET GAME is a richly-written, multi-layered thriller, as all Greg Iles books are, with Natchez as the cauldron & politics & law enforcement as the fire, with deceit, conspiracy & blackmail for flavoring. Lawyer-turned-author Penn Cage returns with an aching heart & his daughter, after years & careers away, only to find his parents under threat. What follows is pure Greg Iles. This author has created a likable hero of ordinary proportions, with extraordinary skills, perceptions & courage, & a tale that's worth every minute of your time. I'm a great fan of Greg Iles."
5,A riveting read,"After having read Spandau Phoenix and Black Cross, I picked up the Quiet Game solely because I knew any book by Greg Iles had to be good. And I was not wrong. While the topic was not one I was usually attracted to (as opposed to the WWII theme of the other two I had read), I was hooked from the first page. I literally could not put this book down. Every time I thought I knew what was going on, another twist and turn proved me wrong. Having recently moved to New Orleans, I found the southern theme very revealing and am looking forward to visiting Natchez. A cast of memorable characters, a troubled period in our country's history, and a surprise in almost every chapter makes for a gripping book. I can't wait to read my next Iles novel."
4,One of Iles' Best,"I recently found Iles and can't put them down. The Quiet Game is one my favorites so far. Very fast paced, nicely developed characters. Puts Grisham to shame."
5,Went in to work bleary eyed on a Monday,"Started reading on a Sunday morning, and could not stop turning pages till I was done 3AM Monday morning. I don't think I got much done at work that Monday morning. This was my first Iles novel, and I think this is also his best one so far, with Dead Sleep a close second, followed by Black Cross. That's my personal opinion. I won't get into a detailed book review here, since that's been done by 100s of other fans. In my opinion, Iles succeeds by writing incredibly taut stories that leave you wanting more. Putting down the book before it's finished is hard."
5,another great Greg Iles book,"The Quiet Game rivals the intensity and suspense of Spandau Phoenix and Mortal Fear. A leading attorney turned successful author returns to his hometown of Natchez, Mississippi, and gets drawn into investigating what appears to be an unsolved civil rights murder that occurred during his childhood. When he begins to discover that the truth of that murder has major ramifications for the present state of affairs in his hometown as well as his personal past and his psyche, the plot of The Quiet Game reaches the high level of Iles' best books. He does a nice job of blending historical threads with familiar experience to create suspenseful fiction. Character development and plot are balanced nicely, and the suspense and the conclusion are wholly satisfactory."
4,The Quiet Game Speaks Loudly,"Iles once again writes an entertaining compelling story. Though somewhat less intense and riveting than his other works, The Quiet Game is the best exploration of southern racism since Grisham's best work in A Time to Kill. A real nice change of pace for Iles. Done with conviction and agreat deal of personality. It was easy to connect with all the characters"
3,Pretty good,"I liked it. It was a good book, grabbed me from the start and kept me going. I would say that there is too much in this book for it to be realistic, but it does make for a good read."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!,Don't miss reading this book! But...don't start it unless you have time to read a lot! It is that good! I have now ordered all the Mr. Iles books and have his new one that comes out in August advanced ordered! Thanks for a great book!
4,Definitely a can't put it down,"Although parts of the book were hard to believe, I found this a book you can't put down. I have read all of Iles books and this is as good as the rest.One part I found very interesting was the sub plot of a lost love returns. I think many of us have a had a love leave us and always wonder what it would be like if they returned. This novel explores that issue albeit as part of the main plot.I was a little disappointed during the trial when undiscovered evidence was found to save the day, but I guess that is standard.All in all, heartily give this book a good thumbs up."
3,so-so,this book goes from being really interesting to kind of boring. right as it's slow and not very interesting. It picks up.
4,"Well written, easy flowing, overall enjoyable.","I've never read this author before, but I was pleasantly surprised. This book is well written, with characters that touch your heart and hidden meanings that come to light in meaningful ways. I admire the main character's stamina, strength and perserverance in the face of strong tragedy and heartache. The little girl is believable and you can picture her as cute, and yet the author does not overdo her. All in all, the plot is interesting, and not hard to get through at all. Intrigue and suspense combine to form a novel that will keep you turning pages."
3,"Re-Hash, but Satisfying","This book definitely does not come up to the quality of Mortal Fear, Spandau Phoenix, or Black Cross, but it is a satisfying read. It reads slow, picks up steam towards the end, but some aspects of the plot tie up too neatly(and unrealistically). This book has enough to keep it interesting, but there is much that is a re-hash of many others in this genre."
2,Very Disappointing,"After reading Mortal Fear, I was really looking forward to Greg's latest novel. Hard to believe it was written by the same person. The story is old, has been done many times and he has the typical name dropping of cars, clothes, etc.(who cares! ) I regret buying this book (in hardcover) and wouldnt recommend it."
2,Subject matter and background too familiar,"Iles may be as good as Grisham, or a little better, or not quite as good, but the truth is Grisham got there ahead of him (I'm not saying first, mind you). This plot is fine, and the pace fine. It's all fine. But there is a big problem: it's awfully familiar through-and-through, and for me this deadened interest from the word go. Surely part of being a good writer is being able to find new things to write about - even if your publishers don't want you to! This is just another take on a very over-exploited subject. Ditto the background, the politics etc etc"
3,a little too long,"For me, this type of book should move quickly. The author seems to get bogged down in too many details. However, the story itself is very good."
4,a great book by a great author,"Iles has done it again. This is the fourth book of his that I have read, and they have all been outstanding. He does an excellent job of developing characters and setting up sub plots. I would recommend all of Greg Iles books to anyone that enjoys a good read."
4,The Quite Game,"""The Quite Game"" is the first Greg Iles book that I have read. In my opinion Greg Iles is on the same level with Michael Connelly and James Lee Burke two of my favorite writers. The book held my attention from the very beginning and at times I didn't want to put it down. There were enough twists and turns in the book to keep you guessing. While the ending was predictable it was very satisfying. I am anxious to start reading another Greg Iles book."
5,Honeymoon Buster!,"The Quiet Game was the first book I had allowed myself the luxury of 'wallowing in' in quite some time. My timing for reading this book was poor, though. I chose right before my wedding to turn the first page....and as much as I love my new husband, I found myself sneaking into the bathroom, making false claims of needed naps...anything to get back into the room to get my hands on that book! If a book is going to grab my attention, it had better do it on the first page. I was intrigued in the first paragraph. The plot was quick and had me turning pages late into the night. Greg Iles captured a feel of the deep South...the good and the bad. I wanted my Yankee husband to read the book to understand more of my deep commitment to my roots, but to also see the 'ugly' truth that still runs deep in many towns in the South. I bought another copy of the book for my mom-in-law. Anyone who appreciates a well-written story is in store for some first-rate entertainment."
2,I wanted more,"I was very excited to get this book because I was antcipating a more global view of future research centers. What I found was a book that spent a lot of time reviewing the past and the research practices done then. Fortunately, towards the end of the book, I learned some interesting facts about how companies are preparing for tomorrow with their research arms. But I was none-the-less disappointed with the lack of substance on the research to come in the future."
4,Insightful!,"Robert Buderi has produced a work of impressive detail - a thoroughly documented account of the workings of the world's leading research labs. The book carefully follows the financial swings of the R&D effort, and closely examines the increasing pressure on researchers to turn a quick buck. The history of this critical economic component is probably unknown to most readers, and Buderi tells an engrossing tale. The book's one inescapable shortcoming, however, is the fact that Buderi finishes his story without a mention of the vast innovation currently sprouting from sources far afield of the Fortune 500. In addition, little mention is made of what makes some research efforts flourish while others fade. Nevertheless, we at getAbstract highly recommend Engines of Tomorrow as a book that rises beyond a simple corporate history to a study in human innovation."
4,"Origins, Attitudes, and Personalities of Research","This book provides a fascinating overview of the emergence and evolution of research as a method for creating new products. The opening chapter describes the beneficial effects of research on companies and countries. It is very interesting to see that the debates over the roles of pure and applied research began almost as soon as research laboratories were formed.The second chapter describes how chemists' searching for new cloth dyes created a wide variety of new industries -- dyes, industrial chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.The rest of the chapters are devoted to the history and projects of major research labs like those at Bell, IBM, Seimens, HP, Microsoft, and Intel.Fascinating read for everyone involved in the business of research."
2,Unhappy customer,Was not happy was told it had no writing in it but it was written in also I think the shipping cost for a book is way to much also.I ended up paying almost $14.00 for the book and workbook that only cost $16.00 brand new.So I would say not a good deal.Sorry
5,Great Study,Our womens group did this Bible Study and it's really great. We didn't use the workbook as the book itself has some great questions included at the end of each chapter... but I'm sure if you took the time to do the workbook you'd get even more out of it. Super good study for new-comers or old-timers!
4,Bad Girls of the Bible,This workbook is how I began to read the Bad Girls of the Bible. What's enduring is how the author engages in conversation by asking readers how they think and feel. The book was used for Christian Methodist Episcopal Church Women's Missionary Society Institute.Bad Girls of the Bible Workbook [BAD GIRLS OF THE BIBLE WO]
5,Bad Girls Of The Bible,"We are currently using these books for a bible study. The purchase was easy, and the books arrived in a timely fashion."
3,Difficult packaging,"I bought this product to help with my splitting/peeling nails.Packaging issue:I bought this product and ended up having trouble using it because the tube is metallic in nature and one push, which I guess was a bit too strong, caused the cream to start flowing through the tip. I tried to cause the flow to stop by manipulating the tube a little, but it seemd to only get worse. In the end it could only be stopped by putting the cap on or keeping my finger over the tip. The moment I would attempt to open it again the cream would again begin flowing out. I finally gave up and drained it into a little plastic container used for samples.Actual cream review:I have been using this cream for a few days and it does feel heavy as mentioned by a previous reviewer. As of yet I do not notice any differences in my nail appearance/feel. I am using this as a nail cream and choose not to push back my cuticles."
3,"Fun, but unrealistic, mini-game","This is a scaled-down version that is closer to Arena Football then to the NFL. 5-man teams (with players playing both ways) compete in an often monotonous display of slamming and taunting. There is little control of the players, and this game seems to be geared toward a younger crowd. Nonetheless, my kids enjoy the game, and the optional game features make it somewhat interesting."
5,One of the most awesome stories ever told,"Frank Miller gets mainstream attention for stories that are not that exciting, thrilling and hot, but typical. In this book, you see imaginative story lines, characters, in fact a whole world depicted that is fresh and unusual and makes you think. I highly recommend this to anyone tired of the same cliches and stereotypes found in mainstream entertainment, particularly of black women. I praise Frank Miller for his vision, and also recommend a similarly unique book of his called Ronin."
4,LIBERTY,"Well, that's a Frank Miller's story. You know about Frank Miller, he's always a genius. In this particular book he had the help of Dave Gibbons (Watchmen's illustrator), that is always the warranty of a good drawing. But the book has troubles. It's not like ""Dark knight returns"" or ""ronin"", Frank Miller's classics. It's... softer. I mean, it's good, but do not expect classic Miller's type of stories. But worth the prize. You must buy it."
2,Paint chips dig into skin,"The finish on these plates chips or wears off, especially where the hole is and the tiny metallic chips dig into to your skin. I had to use a nail clipper to remove the chips (and some dead skin) off of my hands during every exercise. The black version seems to be much worse than the grey one. The black one has more of a matte finish while the grey one is glossy paint and doesn't chip much. I would not recommend these unless you're wearing gloves."
3,Readable,"The author could have done more with the story. There are numerous technical errors that take away from the story and after a few I found myself looking for more. Overall, the story isn't too bad, with an interesting look at the Sargasso Sea which seems to be rarely mentioned in fiction except for vague references to lost ships or airplanes. More character development would have been nice (and made the book thicker). Worth a look."
4,Crucial Setting,"R. Karl Largent's title refers to the Sargasso, a patch of the Atlantic famous for its floating weed. This setting has unusually high significance to the events of this ""techno-thriller"". It is beneath the surface amid the sargassum and ""swarm quakes"" as well as the above-surface fog that the villains perpetrate their deceit. The protagonist, Elliott Wages, is a thoughtful and, as we discover, vulnerable sort that relates the action in the first person. A salvage expedition (treasure hunt) is being sabotaged and Elliott assumes the task of peeling the onion. The reader is privy to his suspicions and discoveries, making for a very quick read. I enjoyed this story and consider it reminiscent of the best classic mysteries, if not a little too formula. In spite of the occasional credibility stretch the premise is not all that far-fetched. Very entertaining."
3,Not all that Dino-mite...,"I would place this book in the same catageory as Deb Lund's ""Dinosailors"". Dino-this, Dino-that, Dino-blaa-blaa-blaa. There is nothing really unique about using dinosaurs and they don't add anything storywise except some fun pictures for the kids to look at. The story could have used teddy bears or frogs and the story would have been pretty much the same. The little jokes in the illustrations are fun for the adult reader. Not her best work."
4,You are what you eat,"There was some valuable information on this dvd, and it was worth the money spent. It was a basic course in vegetarianism, of which I have been a member for many years. I had hoped for more current information about new breakthroughs on this subject."
3,"Nice, interesting but","I liked the way he covered the various greens and used the vita mixer to do various foods. Once you view it, you probably will not view it again unless something specific you wanted to make that you saw. I would suggest you get it at the library which usually carries these type of things. If your library does not have it - then you just fill out a slip and request and they will buy it for the patrons."
4,A simple and practical guide for preparing plant-based foods,"Dr. Fuhrman's presentation is simple, direct, and practical. That's exacly what I would like to get when I bought it."
5,eating healthy,"This was good for me to have a very basic elementary presentation of the different foods. I have learned to try veggies that I have never have considered before. Because I have developed such bad eating habits, this was good for me to see how to strip kale, and the importance of chopping it before eating it. I have recommended this video with the notation it is super basic, but that is what I like about it. Getting right thinking doesn't have to be complicated, it begins with building a good nutrition foundation. I also recommend the Nutrition handbook. I have lost 5 lbs by changing the way I eat. I was inspired by my girlfriend who has lost 30 lbs in 11 weeks, by changing the way she ate. I got the name of the book and ordered this video to get myself to change my mindset."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping for recipes. By the time I ordered the book, I didn't need further convincing - I needed help executing the plan. I also bought the DVD which was equally disappointing. I was already sold."
1,useless for most of us,If you are not going to work at the center of the money making machine (NASDAQ floor) then it is a waste of money. I can sell you mine.
3,Techie's Temple,For those technically inclined to chartists and trying to figure out what's going on...
2,Uninteresting!,"This book contains some appreciable and actual facts about stock market. But that's about it. In any reasonable mind, technical analysis in stock market is like astrology. In three words: useless, boring, and complicated. So don't waste your time and money on this book.This book is so boring and complicated than I never finnished it. The reality in stock market is a lot different. If you want to succeed: Keep it simple! Buy stocks from excellent companies at their low and hold on. It's that simple! You don't need complicated graphs analysis and worthless ritual like that.Keep it simple!"
3,Eye Opener,While this book is insightful to individuals who have never utilized technicals for investing it is somewhat dated. Adjustments to the moving averages and use of various time frames would enhance its value.
4,avoid big losses,"hard to find stocks that meet all of his criteria for a breakout. but, this book is helpful in avoiding losers."
3,never mind the method,"While the method itself may be quite controversial, the book makes some very good points which both technicians and fundamentalists should consider equally:1. use stop-loss orders to limit your losses and always sell automatically.2. get rid of weak positions - don't patiently watch your stocks getting clobbered.3. don't catch falling knives."
5,Great book! Filled in the gaps ...,"So I've spent about $5,000 on a course to learn how to trade. Tried out trading, it didn't work out the way I wanted it to. Then I ran into a guy online who suggested 7 or 8 books that every trader should have. This was one of them. I'm making my way through all the recommended books, but this one was fantastic! It suddenly seemed to fill in all the gaps in my knowledge from the course I had taken. It explained a comprehensive way to view the market (any market) that my $5,000 course never even touched on! Now I feel confident enough to re-enter the market, combining what I learned in the $5,000 course and this $20 (or so) book. Thank you, Mr. Weinstein."
5,The best trading book there is,"I've read the Darvas' 3 books, most of O'Neil's books, and 2 on Jesse Livermore. By far Stan Weinstein's is the most practical and most helpful. It's a handbook on how to make money on stocks. After reading it, I immediately started making money by switching to the best-performing mutual funds and using a declining 30-wk moving average as a sign when to sell. I'm also doing much better buying stocks and using the 50-day moving average. All you need to do is read this book, and use the free MSN Deluxe Screener at moneycentraldotcom to screen for 52-week highs or lows. If you don't believe that the 30-wk MA works, look at the last 10 years of the nasdaq, and see how the 30-wk gave signals to get in and get out."
3,Best introduction to Technical Analysis I've seen so far,"This was my very very first book on technical analyis and market timing. I didn't even know what a moving average was before reading this book. Sam Weinstein has done an excellent job at describing this field.The whole book is written very clear in an entertaining way with lots of timing tools. His book is just like his approach very systematic and simple. He provides the author with complete trading approaches to enter and exit the market/stocks. His methods to time the market are all very simple, but you'll be able to distinguish a bull market from a bear market with this book.This book will be particularly helpful for people who are occupied with fundamental analysis and want to improve their trading with technical analysis. Almost every method in this book is suited to combine with fundamental stock analysis."
4,Technical Analysis Simplified,"Weinstein's book is an easy read. His simplified technical analysis or chart reading system for buying and selling stocks is easy to understand and seems very workable. His general concepts are very similar to William O'Neils (How To Make Money In Stocks), except that he doesn't use fundamental data in his buy or sell decisions.Overall, I really like Weinstein's down-to-earth writing style. But, some of the charts were small so the ink made the lines appear kind of thick which made it lose some important details. Weinstein tells us volume was important in a breakout, but never really mentioned specifically the source of the volume. In the back of my mind, I had to fill in the source of the volume, which I learned from William O'Neil (How To Make Money In Stocks) that it came from professional or institutional buyers such as pension and mutual funds."
2,Fail to see the 5 stars,"I bought this book because of the high ratings in Amazon. I must say that I fail to see why it deserves such high ratings.The book introduced one central theme - look for a big volume jump when the price crosses the 150-day moving average - and was repetitive after that. The book tried to discuss chart patterns (e.g. head-shoulders) but was pretty lame. The book did not mention anything about other market indicators such as MACD, RSI, etc. Were these indicators unimportant? Were these indicators not in fashion back in 1990? I was perplexed.If you are looking for an introduction to technical analysis, there are better tutorials out on the web than this book (just google ""technical analysis""). Save your money for your next investment."
1,Guide to Losing Your Money to Wall Street,Get in on the secrets for losing your money to Wall Streeters like Weinstein while fooling yourself that you know what you are doing because Stan showed you his secrets of chart reading. Where is the evidence for any of this chart reading stuff consistently producing profits? There is none. It's all BS!
3,Stan Weinstein's Secrets For Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets,This is an old book that was hard to find (I had a photocopied version). It has sompe personal experiences in stock trading. I was pleased to find it on Amazon.
2,Why Two Stars,"This book talks about Volume, Moving Average and Relative Strenght Index. No mention of then most important Stochastic Oscillatore (K%D), Bollinger Bands, Moving Anerage Convergence/Divergence (MACD), Channels ....etc. Then talks about Head ans Shoulder, No mention about the rest like Triple/double tops/bottoms, saucers and spikes, Triangles, Rectangle formation ....etc. No menthion of Eliot Wave Theory , Japanese candlesticks, P&F and the list goes on. If you start trading with what is in this book alone. Then you will discover the secrets for loosing in bull and bear markets."
5,"Set aside everything else you've ""learned"" about stocks.","Read this book before you place another order. Then re-read it. Don't turn a page until you've completely understood it.When you've finished, read ""How To Make Money In Stocks"", by William O'Neil. It covers much of the same ground ( not as well), but adds more info that will make your investing much more profitable.Thank you, Stan. I read your book in 1990 and it has greatly improved my life."
5,Still a good approach,"If a person follows Stan's method of when to buy and sell stocks based solely on technical analysis, I think they will do well. The book does not go into how to select stocks so much based on fundamentals, but there are lots of newsletters out there that do that. It is not easy to track stock price performance relative to the moving averages when your portfolio contains many stocks. I recommend the book but caution the reader that it is not easy to implement the conservative advice given. If anyone knows of a convenient way to keep frequent track of stock price performance relative to their simple moving averages, let me know."
4,One of the best and which presents many gems without being complete and overwhelming,"I read this book after a long career in TA and stock trading and after having read almost all that is out there . I consider it sound advice and very valuable teaching . It is true the charts and graphics are bad but so what !.Neither am I bothered by the poor performance of his advisory services or newsletters .Most of TA is very tenuous and what matters is simplicity and money management , good exits and entry .Most traders want indicators , bells and whistles when the reliability of these is questionable . Similarly people of the Playstation generation want a variety of tools and KPI's .Weinstein sits comfortably with people like Granville , O'Neill and Elder ."
4,A Basic Technical Principle,"This book presents the basic technical-analysis principle that securities and their markets relentlessly move though four stages -- base, rally, top and crash -- which are easily discerned from their moving averages, and how to trade the stages. Today this knowledge is so well-known to technical-analysis traders that it is second nature, but when the book came out in 1988 it was a revelation. The decades since have shown the book's principles to be valid in all markets, which is probably why today anyone making a successful living trading technically is familiar with this book somehow. The book is a slow read considering the relatively few concepts it ultimately presents, but unless you already know this material from somewhere else, it is a disadvantage as a trader or investor not to become familiar with it."
4,A Very good book,"Written with humor, this book made me look differently at the market. This book is pure-technical. Very good for people that have behavioral problems when it comes to stocks (like i used to have). It teaches a method which is good for people who rather have a ""do or not do"" instead of ""think for yourself"" recipe for success.The only annoying thing is self-promotion and a bit of arrogance by the author, but the new bunch of $$$ in my bank account most certainly make up for this:)Another disadvantage is that this book is not up-to-date.Anyway, i still recommend it as it helped my portfolio a great deal."
1,Who let this person be filmed??,"Being true blue opera lover, this was a huge disappointment. This Stefan Zucker is a clueless buffoon, totally unable to conduct a meaningless interview. The entire thing looks like an amateurish farce. I am surprised that all the singers didn't react like Pobbe and threw him out. Just when you think that finally something good and interesting is coming you hear his most irritating voice (+ his most irritating Italian) asking something ludicrous, and that's it. Embarrassing for him, disappointing for opera lovers.He also keeps bringing up his mother which has no place in this documentary (but in his shrink's office).Terrible. One can see lots of good footage of those divas on YouTube, stay away from this. Really."
3,5 star divas - no star Zucker,What a wasted opportunity - There was so much that these immortal artists could have been asked - but instead we get Barbieri being grilled about the sexual apetite of mezzos - Leyla Gencer being called erotic ! embarrasing. The narrative sound is hard to understand but the diva footage is excellent. It is such a shame.
3,SAT II subject test Italian,It was a photocopy. Neither can you tell from the picture and neither it was described as photocopies. It does not make a difference to the learning process but you do not want to pay 46.- for some of photocopies. I would have paid up to 20 - 25.- may be.
1,Disappointment,"The game did not have instructions with it, and when I try to enter the trivia screen, my computer crashes on me, then I'd have to re-install the game.."
3,With some updates this backpack could be the best.,"Generally I am very happy with the backpack. It hold alot of items. I have 2 digital cameras, laptop and some perifirals and it all fits in with the room to spare.What I do not like about that pack are pockets and laptop area. Zippers on pockets do not work really well. They tend to get stock and separate. Pockets temselfs tent to frey.Laptop area is not urganomically designed for the 14.1"" screen laptop that I cary. I have an external CD/Floppy module that plugs into USB port and area is not vey easy to get in to and out of. It would be better if zipper around laptop pocket would go around such that I could just open the entire flap."
4,shit's mostly hot.,"I wish the overall sound was louder and more clear. Maybe a production issue. Still DFA, still rocks for the jocks..."
1,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Listen i just received these yesterday and my pots are all scratched up!!! The box i received it in was damaged!!!!Guess what THE BONUS MATCHING TOOL SET didnt even match all the utensils werent even the same red!Don't buy this set please. The pot set i got at deals is a better quality than this i only spent 15 dollars for a better quality!!!!!!
2,not what I expected,"This set was not as advertised, It seemed lightweight, and did not include the sizes advertised. I contacted Amazon and it was returned with no problem, I reordered the faberware chroma set, I ordered it as a gift for my sister, and she loves it"
3,They need a warranty on the coating.,These non stick pans are really great the non stick works but the sad thing is that is the best part about them. They do not give you a warranty on the coating which is lame.
2,Not even of Bargain quality,"The graphics aren't spectacular or anything, and unforetunately neither is the realism. It gets annoying when the AI players hit the 0-2 slider in the dirt 450 feet to dead center after whiffing two straight 96 mph fastablls down the pipe. With the batting perspectives, batting is simply a random guess of where the ball could end up: simple curves are often more than enough for the AI pitcher to strike out the side. Keeping this game from even breaking into the bargain bin category is the 2-player feature. If it had been exactly like the one-player, the game would be worth the $... I spent. However, it slows down dramatically, making it unplayable and taking away the last possible redeeming quality this game could have."
4,Supernatural horror story,"The Great God Pan combines the supernatural, the primal fears and basic instints in the human being. Excelent for that cold rainy nights. I will look for more Machen novels"
4,"Good story, bad proof-reading/editing","Good short story! Creepy, bizzare, and frightening! Who ever proof read it for publish should go back to school. I really enjoyed it dispite the errors. Good price as well."
2,Just didn't do much for me,"Reviewed the free Kindle version.Well, it may have been scary in it's time, but didn't do much for me. Now, I enjoyed the start with Mary and the doctor. But, I had a hard time caring about later events. It really needed to be longer to get some character development going.The author really like long, long paragraphs (presuming that this isn't a Kindle issue).Still, it's a quick read - and free, so give it a try - you might find something that you enjoy.I'll take Lovecraft for my horror."
3,Great God Pan,I've been meaning to read something by Machen for a while. Partially because I heard this was good and partially because he's Welsh. This is a decent little story but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. If your into twisted Lovecraft type stuff you will like this.
3,So-so Halloween Read,"This is supposed to be a classic horror novel, which I thought would be an interesting read with Halloween around the corner. It is a really fast read, but I was a little disappointed that nothing much actually happened in the story.I guess this is one of those stories where nothing is really described, and your mind is left to fill in the ghastly details that were such a terror to the men that associated with Helen. It was an OK read, but I guess some of the subtleties were lost on me."
2,Over hyped,"I have been reading about this book for awhile now, both in regards to HP Lovecraft and Stephen King among others, King in his book critiquing horror says this is one of the scariest books ever. Well not to me. This edition has reprints of the reviews which came out initially on this book calling it Hoo-Hum! AND Hoo-Hum it is. Now you may say well that's because it's older literature and I respond I still find HPL scary. I like the initial reviewers was very disappointed. Go to the library and get it if you must read."
1,Disappointing,"I read this text because it was recommended by a professor of classical mythology in connection with a lecture on the dark side of Pan. The story's references to Greek mythology, however, are brief and nondescriptive. The mood set by the author has elements of classic 19th century London noir, but the story telling disappoints.The edition is also poorly edited - misspellings and skipped words. I wondered at times if the editor had perhaps deleted paragraphs! And that this was the source of my questionning the professor's recommendation."
4,"nice book, slow shipping","The book was in great shape, the story was ok. The book took FOREVER to get here though."
3,Too small,Got the product quickly & the color is great--my only problem is that the case is too small to hold my camera & the charger.
5,Great Case!,I purchased this case for both my son and daughter. They both loved it and their Casio Exilim Cameras fit in this case very well. I would recommend this case to anyone.
4,Good camera case!,"This case is overall a decent case! It is a little large to carry in your pocket, but it is good for protection. The hard case protects your camera well. There is also a lot of room in the case for other accessories."
3,"like it , but bulky","for my cannon is kind of bulky. I wsih it would be thinner, so I could put it in my purse at all times.Really nice case, just bulky.Love the plastic protector things. the color in nice and fun, but bulky,New camaras need thing cases."
2,Bad controls,"I was watching my niece (5 yrs old) play this game with little success so I tried it. I (an experienced PC game player) tried playing with the joystick and also with the keyboard. Either way, controlling the skateboard is difficult. I became frustrated enough that I stopped playing. I would not recommend this game for any age."
4,"jar, jar, jar...","Good book on the Java 2-D APIs. Would have like a template for the painting of the graphics. i.e. how do i implement a refresh( Graphics2D g ) function: overiding Canvas, JComponent, Component? Using an Applet. Would have been nice to have some sort of template for the examples. Other than that, another good java book to have in the collection."
4,imp for who connecting to com,"I read this book in my friends library. One time i was free , i took the book and mostly i read sub heading. After reading subheadings i decided to buy. I wonder i purchased the book near my NIIT Ltd. Institute. In this book lot of information about Graphics and color full and Photo Shop in Java. It is very use full who connected with computer"
3,replacement plan,"I purchased this replacement plan to insure my appliances where covered in case they were broken somehow. Honestly, I never had to use it, because nothing went wrong with what I purchased. It was nice to have ""just in case"" something did break. Thanks for offering this coverage on Amazon for ""just in case"" something went wrong. I guess I really can't rate it since it's past my ""1-year plan"" and never got to use it."
5,"yay, great book",we love this book it gave us a great idea for my kids sleepover birthday party and it arrived super fast.
3,"Not bad, not great.","This is a novelization of a popular ""Next Generation"" episode, in which Picard and the Enterprise crew interact with Spock. All told, it isn't a bad job of novelization, but it's a little rough around the edges; the author mentions in her introduction that it took her a month to write it; that seems like an awfully short time to throw together a project of this size, and it shows. Still, the plot is interesting, the characters handled reasonably well, and other than a few points where there was obviously an insufficiency of proofreading and copy editing, the writing isn't bad. If you're a fan who enjoys almost any Star Trek book, this one is certainly good enough for you. If, on the other hand, you only bother with the best of the large selection of Star Trek books, this one won't make the grade."
3,Just OK...,"Have used with China Glaze polishes and OPI Polishes. I will not use again. Need one drop for each nail (2 for thumbs or great toe) and bottle doesn't last for many application. Also, did not notice a great difference in dry time."
1,Unbelievable TRIPE,"My girlfriend bought me this book for my birthday, knowing how much I love dogs. Initially I was simply annoyed at it - ""what a waste"" I think were my thoughts as I tossed it into the can...but then I got angry upon more thought. This book is so unbelievably bad it's an insult. It's awful when you think about how many really great literary works go unpublished while junk like this (and the other books that follow in this series) get the big GREEN LIGHT and thumbs up. I can only guess that Jeff Selis has some relative or good friend in the publishing business...and a few others who write and submit positive reviews to Amazon. Do not buy this book or any more that follow from Jeff Selis - let's stop rewarding people and businesses for mediocre work."
1,"Many errors, poor review questions","This book is poor. I scored a low 79% on the tests, but found that many of the answers provided were just plain wrong.I was irritated that it required me to install Windows to install the quiz questions from the CD.It failed to mention clearly that during installation, selecting the packages required for kernel compilation saves a lot of time (I forgot that in the exam!)The copy I bought (year 2000) was very out of date, referring to RH 6.0, whereas current tests are at 7.1, which is quite different.I will pass my copy on to our College library, but I am not sure that it will benefit my students very much."
1,Don't bother wasting $42,Firstly - required OS for pre and post tests is windoze. Secondly - when it comes to real world solutions the book suggests you read the man pages and HOWTOs. Plenty of docs reprinted - hardware howto takes up 20 pages. Seems like they were struggling to find content and reprinted much of the HOWTOs. Might as well save the $42 and read /usr/doc/* anyway. Disappointing for a Red Hat affiliate company. I prefer SAMS RedHat Linux Unleashed for real content.
4,Good Book despite Cd-Linux Incompatability,"Before I being, let me mention that I run the premiere websitefor people studying for their RHCE exam at ( )Ireally like the book itself. It's very thorough. At the end of each chapter there is a ""two minute drill"" which summarizes the chapter, and a self test which helps you see how well you understand the material. The self-test at the end of each chapter has around 20 questions! This is much better than other books that only have 10 questions at the end of each chapter.The practice tests on the cdrom are not usable under Linux. If they aren't going to make their software compatible with Linux, they could at least grant us the ability to do that in their licensing agreement. I invite people who want practice tests to visit my website.But, despite the sillyness of relasing a book about Linux with software that requires Windows, I like the book.( ) END"
4,Exactly what I needed,"It doesn't treat the reader as a dummy, but thoroughly covers the topics needed for the exam. As I am studying, it has already been helpful as a reference text. Worth the money. Worth the read."
2,insufficient information,"The crunch topics-ADO ,etc are not covered in detail. Too verbose, have to go thru a number of pages to understand one concept. Dont go for it"
2,"This book is thin on facts, and heavy on fluff and weight!!","I found that this book was extra heavy in weight, but lacked much of what you need to pass the exam. I'd suggest getting the Exam Cram series for this test, unless you are new to VB 6. If you are new, I still wouldn't suggest this book, I'd suggest getting one of the VB 6 in 21 days books, and follow up with the Exam Cram material. You couldn't use this book to get certified, unless you used the weight of the book to knock an MCP on the head to take his certification.I passed both VB certs, but I found that this book was a waste. Good luck on your exams!"
3,Review,"I read this book and passed my 70-175 exam. However, I did not depend on the book alone - I also made use of the Mastering Series CD covering enterprise developement. It also helped that I also have studied for and passed the 70-176 exam. There are numerous typos and errata to weed out though especially in the practice questions. Too much focus is given to the IDEs and program setup of the backoffice components. Perhaps that is required to get the MS seal of approval, but that kind of stuff is not covered in either of the exams I took. ADO is covered more thoroughly in the 70-176 exam preps but is also required on 70-175. Package-and-Deployment is not covered sufficiently either. The coverage of SNA and MSMQ was extraneous. Take 70-176 first or you will be taken off guard by the user services requirements of the exams because this book is not any help there."
1,Don't bother,"There is no excuse for errors, no matter how small or obvious. Some in here are glaring. For example: how logical design effects performance has to do with issues like distributing application logic to multiple servers, which optimizes scalability but will have a slight negative effect on performance. Logical design has nothing to do with what data types you use for performance optimization. That's a physical design issue! The authors did not understand this. They also do not understand how to make a point without rambling. This book is barely readable compared to the many technical books I've read. I normally don't like to write negative reviews, but this book was very bad in my opinion, and I've been doing VB6 middle tier programming for a couple years. I just took the 70-175 exam and passed by a wide margin. You are much better off spending your money on MCSD Nutshell. It is excellent. Even the MS MCSD training kit was significantly better than Syngress' book."
2,Looks like it was taken from several white papers,"I like this book for the fact that it goes straight to the point. To the point of being like a compilation of several whitepapers. Not really, organized in a way that a beginner might understand. Some topics are redundant because the authors have each of their own version of a particular topic. The topic about MTS for example is very hard to follow if you do not have some experience with it."
1,PLEASE don't buy this book!!!,"I'm not sure how anyone can actually say they read this book any passed the exam 70-175 because of this book!! It does not mention ADO!! How about DHTML,IIS and WEBClass?? Really, don't buy this book."
1,Not good enough!,"This book is definitely not recommended to actually learn and absorb the material. Of course, it would have been awfully naive of me to expect to actually learn something from a study guide! However, it did not even perform its stated objective-to cover the material from an ""exam cram"" viewpoint. I just (narrowly) passed this exam and in my opinion, an ""exam cram"" book is totally useless for the new track exams. Almost all the questions were practical scenario based questions. I was better served by the Microsoft Mastering CD's and books like GASullivan's ""Building Enterprise Solutions"" or the Wrox press MTS/MSMQ book etc. In summary, don't waste your money on this or any other study guide - try to actually learn the material by reading other books and practising applications. (Novel concept!)"
2,Too lengthy,"By the time you finish this book, assuming you're using it to cram for the 70-176 exam, the VB6 certification will be outdated. The Fast Track series of study guides is much more efficient for exam purposes. AND CHEAPER TOO!!"
3,"Not bad, Helpful but Buggy.","I used this book and the Microsoft training CD to study for the Exam. I also have over 10 year experience using Visual Basic. I passed the Exam. This book does not cover everything that is on the exam. The practice test that comes with the book has many errors. I used the MCSD 70-176 exam book from Syngress and it also was lacking and buggy. I hope they clean up their books in the future. However, I will recommend this book as a study guide for the exam as long as other materials are also used to study from."
3,Don't depend on this book only.,This book gives a pretty good overview of the exam. But it doesn't provide enough details on various softwares the Microsoft will be testing you on. Be sure not to just depend on this book like I had done.
2,Like reading cotton candy,"75% fluff, 25% substance. I'm only about 1/2 of the way through the book (so weigh my opinion accordingly) but I can already tell that this book has some major gaps in it. I was able to make it through his minimal coverage of Data Sources and Data Classes (as I understand it, two rather important concepts) only by indepth searching of the MSDN Library (since setting up DSN's-required to run his ludicrously skimpy examples-is ""beyond the scope of this book""). As a MS Certified 3-year VB veteran, I feel tremendously sorry for anyone with less experience trying to use this as a study guide. Looking forward, I see lots and lots of information on server-side administration/configuration, but virtually no code. Not a good sign. There should be a better study guide out by now, and if there isn't, wait for it."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This product is as cheap in quality as it is in price. I have short dark brown hair (under 8"" long) and followed the instructions verbatim, and after 1 treatment you could still see the brown in my hair under lights. Bought a second batch and did it a second time same day to get the remaining brown out, but my hair turned blue with some black. Now 3 days later, it's already almost half washed out and I only shampoo once every other day with special shampoo for color treated hair. A very large disappointment from L'oreal."
1,Quite possibly the worst golf game I've ever played,"I have had this game for over five years now and sill have not had the patiants to finish a round. This game is a huge waste of money even to rent. This game is under par in every aspect: the gaphics are barely on par with SNES, they game play is slow and takes an excruciatingly long time to load. The % calculator used for shots is not even close to accurate, wind speed is not even approximated and there is no aid in reading the slope of the green. I recomend buying one of the more reccent releases, this game isn't worth the [money amount] you'll pay for S&H."
1,Old Game,"I bought this game thinking it would be up to date technology, and was sorley disappointed. This game is dated 1995, and is extremely OLD. I also play Tiger Woods 2001, so this game is a big step back in time. DON'T BUY."
4,Songs that were learned and sung....,"A great band with an awful name. The material is worth a full 5 stars but we've kinda ""been there done that"" with their previous ""best of"" collection: Songs to Learn and Sing. Ballyhoo should have been a double CD collection to include missing tracks like ""Puppet"" and ""Ocean Rain"", not to mention some of their better remixes like ""The Cutter"". And Nick Hull needn't apologize for comparing them to Coldplay. Chris Martin is a self-admitted fan of Echo, and it definitely shows in Coldplay's second album. (Coldplay's b-side ""Crests of Waves"" is lyrically a sequel to Echo's ""Ocean Rain"" and stylistically classic Bunneymen). And let's not forget Coldplay's cover of ""Lips Like Sugar""."
4,great machine,"Love this machine. It really works, makes you burn if you do it right. It was okay to assemble, I don't like having to put anything together, but this wasn't bad at all. It takes up a bit of floor space so make sure you're ready for that. Its easy to switch between legs, just a peg to move...for the price its a good deal."
2,Overpraised Prose,"I approached this book with tremendous enthusiasm. Unfortunately, when I actually sat down to read LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE, I was stunned. The writing was uneven and forced. In many places, the author appeared to be struggling to sound ""literary"" at the expense of narrative flow and character development. Lately, I've seen so many books over-praised and over-hyped for the sake of sales and market share. I hate to say it, but LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE is one of them. I think the writer is skilled, but this book does nothing to showcase her talents. Disappointing all around."
2,Mixed-Up Metaphors,"Only in the third chapter, I'm struggling to read it through the annoying metaphors that seem to be there without purpose. For example, in surveying the room Lena burnt, Ella notices the curtains that remind her of sea creatures .. WHY? Then she moves on. And in the next few sentences, she throws in another metaphor with no relation to the previous one. And so on... Despite the lack of ""flow"", the characters are original and interesting."
2,Heard it on NPR,"""The Other Sister"" of overpriced bestsellers. It just plain didn't seem that good. Read a real book instead."
3,A wonderful (if not extraordinary) debut novel,"...I think the book stands out among debut novels by youngishwriters because of its generous spirit. Bender's tone is the oppositeof the jaded, ironic, name-brand dropping style that some new writers adopt as a cheap substitute for real-world experience. Bender's writing is empathetic towards all her characters strengths and foibles and for that I say hurrah."
3,Not great - but still pretty good,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I rushed out and bought a copy right away, even recommended it as a selection for my book club. I was only slightly disappointed to find it wasn't exactly the debut of the year I'd been expecting. Not that it's awful - it just isn't great. Like Normal People is a sweet, simple story that might have been better had it been the author's second or third book. Karen E. Bender is definitely an author to watch for in the future."
4,Relaxing,"Soothing instrumental music. Wonderful for going to sleep to. However, beware. If you're planning to rip it to your computer or put it on your iPod, forget it. It has the new protection that will not allow you to rip it to your computer. But it is a really cool CD."
5,"Amazing illustrations, Creative story!","Fantastic illustrations, adorable idea, a bit of an effort to read aloud, but well worth it in kudos from the kids. It all starts when Lulu has an itty-bitty problem with her homework. You never realize all the silly-willy syntax idiosyncracies our language has until you read this book! Fun for everyone. A must-buy."
4,Tongue twister,This book had outrageous dialogue and a great sence of humor. It almost was like I was right there with them flaping my tongue with them. I just love the way they talk. But make sure you skip pages when words are flood the air because if you read those pages you'll get a headache.
5,Typical Andrew Clements - Awesome,"This book is fantastic. It is funny, engaging, and educational. Not only does this book offer opportunity for children to advance their fluency, but it also demonstrates the versatility afforded to any author. This will show students that writing does not have to be boring."
4,Book 6 of 7 in Tomorrow Series,"This may be the weakest volume in the Tomorrow series. It is still a non-stop page turner, but it didn't have the action you'd expect after reading the first 5 volumes. The story is mostly about dealing with a band of feral orphans of the war. They cause constant trouble and frustration for Ellie, and the others. This is the only book in the series that leaves a cliffhanger at the end to get you crying for the finale...which I will start to read as soon as I finish this review."
4,"Very good, as always","The Tomorrow series may be the best seven books I've ever read. John Marsden is an excellent writer, and he almost make me think that this war is real.But this book probably is the worst of the seven. It wasn't such a thrill reading it as the others, as this book's just made to build up the tension for the grand finale in ""The Other Side of Dawn"". The only thing that really happens is that they run a daycare center for some feral kids, and that they get aware of soldiers lurking outside Hell.Luckily, Marsden can with his spell-binding writing still capture the reader in this book."
2,Progressively Worse,"Once I start a series, I like to finish it. And like most series, this one gets bogged down and does not remain fresh. The introduction small children to the mix makes for a very boring read."
1,Toulouse is too much,"I ordered this book for my 6 year old, solely based on the plot summary. I expected about 3-4 sentences per page for this age group. This book contains 6-7 paragraphs per page, most of which are wise-cracks by ancillary characters, rather than a meaningful part of Toulouse's story. The story is primarily told as a flashback by an elderly goose, but often switches from past to present as the younger geese comment on the story. Text wise, this book should be for a 10-11 year old, but I think the substance of the plot is too lame to interest this age group."
1,VMX Racing,"I personally don't like this game and don't recomend it to anyone . It has horrible driving abilities, and the racing is so boring, I think this game is the next step up from ""exite bike"" for the origional nintendo system."
4,It stinks,The graphics are terrible do not buy! Play control lacks. Definatly go with motorcer 2 of jeramy Mcgrath motocros
5,Rodger C. Carmel: An under rated talent,"For those of you who love the original series; you're in for a treat. Rodger C. Carmel left us too early. His passing in 1986, was not met with much publicity. Harcourt Fenton Mudd would've been ideal for the film series. This ""scoundrel"" couldn't fool any of his victims for long. Between his android followers and beautiful women; was a rich character that should've had his own series"
2,Don't waste your money,"At over thirty dollars, I expected more from this book. Like a better index. Some organization. And honesty about what the problem can and can't do.This book is little more than a sales demo of what the product can do. However, even then they haven't done a very good job.I suppose this book would be OK if I were taking a class and had a teacher there. But on its own there's not enough explanation of why you want to do things.The visual quickstart book is half the price, but contains much better instructions, is laid out better, and has a good index."
3,undecided,"Steep learning curve for an old guy, How about a button for 'apply changes'? (seems fundamental to me). Hope it's worth it in the end. Lots of help on-line so that's good."
5,Garden Tractor Spinner,"This order was delivered faster than any of our Amazon purchases. It was as advertised and in perfect condition. This is the standard we have come to expect from Amazon and their associates,"
4,JOHN DEERE TRACTOR REVIEW,"RECEIVED ITEM QUICKLY. THE PICTURE ON THE SCREEN LOOKS LIKE IT HAD SOME YELLOW IN THE SPOKES BUT MINE WAS ONLY GREEN, BLACK AND WHITE. MOST JOHN DEERE ITEMS HAVE GREEN AND YELLOW TO THEM. A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THAT BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SEND IT BACK AND DEAL WITH THE HASSLE. ALREADY GAVE IT AS A PRESENT TO SOMEONE. ALL IN ALL SATISFIED."
5,memories,my husband of 50 myears who passed away on 12/08/11 loved being on his tractor so i got 2 of these one for our home and one for our summer home. when i look at these it bring back memerious of when he would be riding his tractor.WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THESE ITEMSrip joe
4,Quick & Dirty Guide to Salsa is a Good Buy,"This is a collection of 4 DVDs (for beginner, intermediate, advanced, and team dancing). They explain things well while giving clear views of the dance steps. The dance combinations build up on each other; starting with basic blocks that are later combined and modified to create advanced steps. This technique makes it easier to breakdown and remember the complex patterns. Each new combination is demonstrated several times but not excessively, so if it clicks for you, you can continue to the next one and if not, you can repeat that combination (""scene"" on the DVD) as many times as necessary. There is one couple in the videos; the lady does most of the explaining but they discuss both the male and female parts as well as occasional tips for the lead."
5,Easy to understand,"The motion descbied in the DVD is easy to understand,since we can see the dancer even from the backside.The instructions are also nice!I am surtisfied with this DVD"
4,"Very, Very Good","This 3-level course is worth every penny. Very well put together. The instructors' style is elegant, yet passionate. The 1st level alone will make you dance salsa way above average. The only aspect where I found the course to be a little bit below expectation is that -unlike in the 1st level- the 2nd and 3rd levels don't have 1) the full review of all steps back-to-back without music, and 2) the steps called out during the review with music (however, if you are an experienced dancer who is just looking for new moves, this won't bother you at all). The 3-angle camera comes in handy and you'll be using it a lot."
1,Not great for the guys,"This DVD may be better for the woman's steps; however, the instruction for the man's steps are rare and often confusing. At one point, the female instructor indicates that the man's left hand is to be placed on the woman's back. It seemed awkward and, after several replays, it was evident that the man's right hand was to be placed on the woman's back. It seems that the instructor or the editor of a dance instruction DVD should be able to tell right from left. The ablility to review the steps in three different angles helps."
5,Favorite Book,"My 5 yr old is really into the Knights' Kingdom, so he really LOVES this book. We read it every night before bed."
2,A suckish basketball game,"One of the worst addictive games I've ever played. I hated the game.For a platform game of it's time it had no trace of 3-D graphics.Only lame 2-D graphics with poor,low quality detail of its images. I hated this game so much,yet fatefully everso addictive.Yes,horibble gameplay,and even worst mini-games.I have no clue why it is addictive...It just is.Even though poor quality throughout the game, I recommend this for every PS1 gamer....Because its,uh.....addictive and horrible way."
1,space jam garbage,this game is horrible it does not play it was all scratched up and i will NEVER EVER purchase a game form amazon.com again
1,Runs too slow to play,"Installed on Gateway with Pentium 2 processor as well as on PowerMac with Virtual PC. The game runs too slow to play on either, I can't find anywhere on-line through eGames to provide service to help it run better. Has poor instructions &... was a waste of $ in my opinion. Try it on your machine, maybe your machine is new enough it will run better but I wouldn't buy it again.Marble Blaster"
4,A Family History - well worth the effort.,"Excellent account of life in pre-WW2 Poland and the devastating years of the war itself. What is so remarkable is that the survival rate of this family was comparatively high compared to other Holocaust stories - mostly as a result of a family that saw the terror coming, and fleeing outside of the eventual jackboot sphere, with Diana's immediate family living precarious daily lives through their sheer wits in Nazi occupied Poland. How remarkably easy reflect our own lives against these - just to be grateful and marvel at the human spirit, read and be grateful."
4,No more worries!,I bought these brand name Lactaid tablets when the store was out of generic. They work very well for lactose intolerance. I usually take two caplets when I eat something that is full dairy (like ice cream or cheese) and one caplet when I eat something that contains some dairy. No more worries!I still prefer generic for the price. Just check the lactase units on the back of the box to be sure it's the same. Some have more lactase enzyme per tablet than others. This particular product has 9000 FCC Lactase Units per caplet.
5,Daughter and Wife can finally enjoy milk!,"Was skeptical as to whether or not these would actually work, but decided to give them a shot.My wife has always had a hard time with milk (stomach aches) and my 5 year old has had the same thing since birth. Neither would eat cereal or anything cause of it and daughter had to have soy milk as a baby. Ordered these and no my daughter asks for cereal for dinner. Last night she had 3 bowls and no problems. Easy for her to swallow and works great.Wife says the best thing about them is they are INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED. She throws a couple in her purse just in case she may ever need them.Lactaid worked great. Next time we will be ordering the larger box."
2,Just a delay...,"I've been using these for my lactose intolerance for a couple months now and they seemed to be working great, but eventually I began to notice a trend that my stomach problems would happen later on or the next day, and I don't even eat a lot of dairy, just a piece of cheese or a little milk here and there...These pills just delay the onset of my stomach difficulties. I guess it's back to no dairy for me."
5,This a great product,"I have used it for years, but lately I have tried the NOW Dairy Digest and am very pleased with it too. So just take your pick! You can't go wrong if you are bothered with lactose intolerance. I don't know about other people but I was sick to death of the pain associated with not being able to digest lactose!"
3,"Bom, mas no age da mesma forma para todos","O produto é bom, mas dependendo do nível da intolerncia no resolve da melhor forma.Tomei duas pílulas antes do almoo, e comi um prato com muito creme de leite e requeijo cremoso, de sobremesa comi sorvete.O incomodo demourou pra aparecer, mas quando veio foi muito intenso."
1,NOT FDA TESTED?,"I bought the [b]Walgreens[/b] generic brand of this, just to see ""comapre to Lactaid.."" Same units of the same FCC lactase units. I took 1 pill right before i started drinking a 16oz milkshake and then another half way in.The product did nothing.About 4-5 hours later i had the same gas and churning i would always get.products may be sold making any claim with a food product as long as they say ""*not approved by FDA""**DO NOT BE FOOLED by supplements when there is no basis in factual research, no double blind clinical trials or evidence.**Check this product and ensure it has approval by FDA, if not consider it useless."
4,I can eat dairy again!,I can eat dairy again!I got tired of only consuming soy based protein shakes and cheeses. I take 2 pills and I am able to consume a whey protein shake with hardly any heart burn/indigestion. This makes my life so much easier. I am glad that I tried this stuff. I'm excited to eat pizza again!
4,Generics work as good,"I've tried several different types of milks and many dairy digestive aids, from all I've experienced there are generic knock offs that all work as well as the original - are cheaper - and I find work better and taste better.Little small items like this are hard to avoid testing - Feel free to play around and see what works for you, there is no brand loyalty...don't feel bad if something else works better for you..."
2,Possible Side Effects? Yes!!,"Hi all,Just a quick warning to those who have just been diagnosed or figured out that they are intolerant to dairy.I made the mistake of taking this product and having nausea afterwards. I thought it was dairy causing the nausea. So then I upped the dosage to two tablets. Almost instantly after consuming food (using the tablets with the first bite of dairy as directed), I had to vomit. It was a really bad reaction. I believe that they should put on the label the possible side effects of allergic reactions to this product so people like myself will figure out it is this product causing the reaction and not my condition. They do make a statement about anything ""unusual"" occurring, but it is not enough to empower people with knowledge about the specific side effects of an allergic reaction to their product! I am not alone in this as I have seen other statements of reactions to this product on other websites as well."
2,Not enough information,"I am a long-time MCSE 4 and I purchased this set to help me get through the core exams. I am also a CNE-5, CCNA, CCDA. I studied these books and passed the Professional and Server exams. I then studied the directory admin and network admin in preparation for the 70-240 exam. Fortunately, I have 2 cisco routers, 3 hubs, two servers, a cable modem, 2 workstations and 2 laptops. I was able to test everything I read. I was able to pass the 70-240 exam, but I believe it was due to hands-on instead of bookreading. I am going for the 70-219 exam next but won't be buying the Sybex book for this. This set will help you pass the exam if you are able to do all the exercises and create new ones on your own."
3,They were just ok.......,"I used the Sybex books for the NT 4.0 exams so I figured why not use them for the 2000 exams.I thought the 70-210, 70-215 and 70-216 books were good, BUT the 70-217 book is terrible. Lots of mistakes, awful questions at the end of the chapter. I even found some incorrect answers within the questions provided.I'm not sure if I'm going to use Sybex for any of the others."
3,"Not exactly a bull'seye, but you'll pass the tests","Don't get me wrong, these will get you there. But when the other reviewers say that there are inaccuracies, they're not kidding. I think it has to do with their simplified language. Their definitions of Group Scope for example are convoluted, and seemingly contradicts actual functionality. Just compare their definition of a Domain local group in the 70-217 manual to a decent reference manual, or the online help for that matter, and see if you think they got it right. I don't. I wouldn't rely on them for day to day admin, and besides the Microsoft press books usually provide eval versions of the OS for the test labs you'll want to make."
3,WinSimm included ?,"Still one more thing I forgot to mention in my last review of this book-set: I sure hope Sybex will stop using the term ""simulation"" for a simple screenshot-movie ... Don't spend your time on this so-called ""WinSimm 2000"" included on the CD, actually these are just stupid screenshots. The only user-interaction you have is ""forward"" and ""backward"" button ... great isn't it ? Why hasn't Microsoft thought about using only backward-forward?; it would make configuring your server and workstation a LOT easier !! ;-)"
1,"Horridly incomplete, incorrect and inaccurate","Do yourself a favor and stop hating MS for releasing high quality products. The Microsoft core four set is much more on track with what the tests will require. After running into the 17th error in the 70-210 Sybex book I took them back and got the MS Press set. I am now a solid MCSE, which I am sure I would not be had I stuck with the inferior Sybex books. It is obvious that the other reviews here are based on biased feelings towards Microsoft and should not be trusted whatsoever."
2,Do Not Buy This Set,"Do not...Do not...Do not buy this set!! I have used Sybex books in the past and they have been great, but this set (the Win 2k Pro anyway) will not give you enough information to pass the exam. I relyed heavily on this book to get me ready for the Professional 70-210 exam, and I was not prepared at all. I went into the exam thinking that I knew my stuff, and walked out thinking that I was a complete idiot. I failed the exam by 20 points. Spend your money on something else. I think I will try the Official Microsoft book for my retest."
1,You get what you pay for,"If you buy the FREE Kindle version, then this book is worth the price, nothing. If you actually paid money for this book, oh well, that's life. I do not recommend this book except as a free Kindle download that you might read to take your mind off your root canal."
4,Kelp,I have used Kelp as a dietary aid for my thyroid for some time but have always purchased it at health food stores. This product was the same quality at a fraction of the cost. Very pleased with seller as was delivered promptly.
2,Iodine allergy,"Since I am allergic to shellfish, I thought this product would be perfect to replace my iodine/salt minerals. But I still have severe painful swelling even when taking this plant based product. So for me, iodine is still a no no.So if you are allergic to iodine/salt, be careful."
4,good supplement and good price,because such a valuable supplement is so inexpensive I can make sure and take every day
3,Ho Hum,This looks okay (odd colors) but it's too much like the triceratops. It's the same thing with a few more horns.
5,Family and Medical Leave Act Handbook,"I am a Diabetic and had no idea that I would get leave for my chronic condition. Thanks to this handbook, which explains everything clearly, how to utilize this law. My company has for years violated peoples rights pertaining to FMLA. Now I can confront the company and the union on how to proceed on leave matters. Thanks To Mr. Schwartz for writing this book and Pres. Clinton (democrat controlled Congress) for passing this law!"
3,Good to learn but not to pass!,"I bought this book lately, but like other Syngres Exam Study books, they don't cover well the real exam.I just passed the exam this week, it was very complex and long enough to make you feel very boring after few hours from starting.If you are looking to pass the real tough exam, then look else where, such as Sybex Exam Study Guide, which considered more exam-focused study material."
2,Don't count on this book to pass,"The book is less than average, if you count on passing with this big volume...you'd rather think 1000 times before doing so. Their is a lot of missing information especially with the infrastructure and active directory stuff...the easy part is NOT missig. Get a set like sybex."
4,Tough read but good information,"The organization of the book is counter-intuitive and fails to present the information in an order that builds on previous chapters, but the information is accurate and broad in coverage."
4,"Tough topic, tough exam, good book","I just passed the exam using mostly only this book. There is a lot of material in there and so the book is dense. However, taking it step by step, using the quiz on the CD-Rom after each certtrainer chapter, and taking the simulation exam allowed me to get trough the toughest exam of my MCSE certification. I had started studying with the MS Press book and switched to this one for the on-line content.Only one negative comment : the quizzes are full of errors, but this is not the case for the simulation exam.Good luck!"
3,Not turned on.,"I don't like the book because it does not have chapter end questions. You have to get all the practice questions off the CD. It only has ""Two minute drills"" at the end of each chapter. I prefer questions so I can see that I learned the chapter well. The new Sybex book is better."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This book is a travesty.The content is compiled from several authors and very poorly edited. Lots of duplication, typos etc.It's not very approachable. 1500 pages and it starts with Active Directory, a section that will bore you out of your mind. AD is not inherently boring but the covearge in this book is.The CD is a defective joke.Shinder knows his stuff and the networking section which he authored is pretty good, but as an editor he's a non starter.The book was obviously rushed to market."
4,Wrestlemania is Awesome,"This game is SO cool. It's unrealistic but that's what makes it so cool! With eight of the WWF's finest superstars, this is a must buy for only .... Whether you want to send screaming souls at your opponents with the Undertaker, toss your opponent like a rag doll with Yokozuna, or lock your opponent in the sharpshooter with Bret Hart, this game is for you."
5,Scale,"It is light weight and simple to use. Since I purchased this scale, I enjoy using it. It is very accurate."
1,"Not very accurate after a few months. GOD, GIVE US A DECENT SCALE w/o the Bull!","I got this scale as a birthday gift, one of the better gifts I've received(I prefer functional gifts, things that you need in life, i.e. windshield wipers or replacement electrical toothbrush heads) about 2 years ago. It worked great and was very accurate for a few months. I started to put its accuracy to the test by also weighing my packages on the Post Office's Automatic Postal Machine's scale and I found that this scale was not returning accurate weights. This scale would under weigh items and that is a problem when you are mailing packages, since the post office can return the item to you with ""not enough postage"" stamped over the postage you paid. The Post Office will not refund that amount either.Stay clear of this scale.P.S. God, Please create a scale that stays accurate, I beg you."
1,Useless Item,"I ordered and received one of these scales in December, 2006. When it arrived, it worked but was somewhat erratic. A week or so later it just quit working entirely. As it was under warranty, I obtained an RA and sent it for repair (I had to pay shipping one-way). The total cost of this wonderful scale had now risen to over $50. Some time later, I received a replacement unit but this one was a different color than the one sent back. No big deal but, sure enough, a month or so later, the new one died as well. Amazon should cease selling these things. They are, without a doubt, the most cheaply made pieces of junk I've seen since the ""Japanese Transistor Radios"" of the 1950s."
5,A National Park on Your Playlist,"This is a classic that takes me back to my visits of Yellowstone in song and sounds... can almost smell the wildflowers in the high meadows, or the mud pots as they boil along... or see the elk and buffalo in their element. Wonderful. Thanks for the Reissue!"
1,Useless---Unless You Live in Britain,"It's a handbook for people who work with immigrant families in the UNITED KINGDOM. If you're looking for something to do with the United States, keep looking."
1,Unit Does Not Receive Digital Signals,"This unit is an old analog reception TV. It will not work without a coverter box. So, unless you have a battery powered converter box don't expect to take this anywhere and use for things like tailgating or as an emergency receiver."
1,not again,"i might have something good to day about this tv but its the second one i have bought that doesn't have a lead in it to plug in to the mains,so i can't use it. what is wrong with sellers not sending what it says is in the box..."
4,Brilliantly written,I loved how all of the stories seemed to tie together with the same basic human desire for intimacy in all forms. Getting a glimpse into the way other's view sex and more subtle forms of intimacy made it a very worthwhile read.
2,Does not fit,This says it fits a 1998 Explorer XLT v6 SOHC but it does not.Mounting bracket only fits 2 of the 3 sockets and one of the electrical connections is too far for the cable.
2,Would have been good if it fit,"Amazon's website stated it fit a 2001 3.0 EFI Ford Taurus. Unfortunately, it did not. I had to return and purchase locally since I did not have time to wait for another attempt."
3,It's okay,"My daughter got this as a gift at about 10 months of age and could have cared less. The ""satisfying clicking sound"" was not so satisfying. She did like to chew on it while teething and was interested in the mirror for a minute, but overall it just sat there. The quality is excellent as Melissa & Doug products always are, but I can't say that I'd recommend the item as more than a teether."
3,Cute idea but wood has splintered off and paint chips.,"Okay, if you child is still in the throwing things down stage than this probably wouldn't be for you. We bought this for christmas and not hardly a month later two sides of wood have chipped off. The m&d toys we have bought have been far from the quality I expected."
4,Makes Leaving the House Easy,"This one of the best baby products I've spent my own money on. Since going back to work, I carry a large tote bag to work, and all I have to do when I'm home with my baby is toss this in the bag (plus an extra outfit for him) and voila, a diaper bag. Keeping this stocked makes it easy to head out the door in the morning. The only thing I don't love is the wipes case, which feels a bit flimsy and is clunky to use--I wish it had the type of opening where you pull one wipe through the slot rather than where you have to open the whole case just to remove one."
3,Pay attention to the closed dimensions- quite large,"I purchased this to go into my ""masculine"" diaper bag, a black North Face Recon backpack. There is an external mesh pocket on the backpack that seemed to be a great place for a diaper changing pad. Unfortunately, I didn't pay close enough attention to the dimensions of this changing pad when closed- it's quite large, a full 12 inches long; longer than the long end of a normal sheet of paper. That's too large for my mesh pocket, but I would guess it's also too long for many purses. Plus, there is little or no padding in the non-pillow section of the pad, and the construction is not as sturdy as you would expect for 30 dollars.I ordered a First Years changing pad, also black (green inside) that is closer to 10 inches long when closed, fully padded throughout, with the same features (wipe box, mesh pocket, outside zippered pocket). It's just over 10 dollars and seems like a better product, honestly."
2,Not what I expected,"As soon as I received this diaper changing pad, I noticed that the fabric at the ends of the zipper was fraying. Within a couple of days, there was a lot of frayed material hanging off the changing pad, and I had to use a match to melt the fabric to stop the fraying. Poor quality construction.As far as design, this changing pad is very small. My average-sized one year old does not fit on the changing pad anymore, making this worthless to me. With the average age of potty training being north of 2 years old, it makes no sense for this changing pad to be so small, and at a minimum it should be labeled for use by young infants only. The ""plus sign"" style of the changing pad also means less coverage underneath your child.All in all, this is over-hyped and did not live up to expectations."
3,Good product except it broke within a month!,"The bag is great - the changing mat is thick, relatively big, the mesh pocket was good for 2-3 diapers (even at size 4+), I was able to fit a huggies travel wipes case in it without any problems. however, the seam of the front pocket frayed and eventually came undone after a month of use - non-use, actually, since the pocket wouldn't hold anything if the bag was full with diapers and wipes. I contacted SkipHop 2-3 times about it but did not hear back from them at all - I didn't expect them to replace it, but it would've been nice to receive an apology and some sort of discount for a replacement product. I continued using the bag even without a functional front pocket (which would've been great for a driver's licence, a couple of band-aids, chap stick, or other very small items) but was disappointed by the quality given the cost."
4,Suits my needs,"This is a very good changing station, it's like carrying my changing table with me wherever I go. I carry 3 diapers size 5 and a Magic Stick (for rashes) in the mesh pocket and wipes inside the zipper pocket. I didn't use the case as I use the Costco brand wipes which is already pre-cased. You won't be able to put the Kirkland 100 wipes bag inside but you can fit it in once it's half empty. I wish the length of the changing pad could be a little longer, hence minus one star. Whenever I run quick errands, I just take this little bag with me and go. The best part about this bag is the removable changing pad that you can unzip. Once my daughter is potty trained I plan on unzipping the pad and use the rest of the bag as her ""entertainment bag."" The mesh and the 2 zip pockets are perfect for storing notepads, crayons, a travel magna doodle, etc. which is great for older toddlers."
4,neat product,"I like the idea of this small diaper bag that can be stuck in a purse or just carried. A few things could be improved, but overall it is useful and a decent price for what you get.Pros: It is well constructed and holds all the essentials. The diaper pocket holds 2 cloth diapers for me (BG AIO's). The wipes case holds plenty of wipes.Cons: I wish the outside zipper pocket held more, my wallet is a little large and barely fits. As far as utility, it's a little heavier than I expected, and I don't like the idea that the area that would lay on the floor/diaper changer would be ""exposed"" to the inside of my purse/bag if I put this inside another one."
5,"Great design, discrete, great for Dad!","Love this diaper bag. All the essentials for a quick trip anywhere. I throw it in my hiking back and take my little one hiking with me, good for a half day trip. Throw it in the truck anytime she is around. Its black, discrete, and extremely functional. Love the changing pad.... comes in very handy. Can't say enough about this."
2,Zipper Broke,"Wanted to love this but the zipper broke after 2 months (& a handful of uses at that.) Just emailed customer service, we'll see how that goes, from other reviews on here I'm not hoping for much."
5,Convenient accessory,"Wasn't sure how useful this item would be. However, it is very convenient to have with you and to hand off to others with the child. Changing pad is a good size and there is plenty of room for the essentials... includes a wipe case."
5,diaper bag,"Great product. So helpful when you are out with your baby. All the essential products can be stored in this bag which is lightweight, compact and easy to carry."
2,"Good design, but poor quality & customer service","I like the design and convenience of this diaper changing pad, but after 1 month, the seam on the front pocket began unraveling leaving a hole in the front pocket. I contacted Skip Hop for a replacement. Customer service did not reply for 1 month. They arranged for me to return the product before I could receive a replacement. It is now 3 months later and I still have not received a replacement after contacting them numerous times.I also have a Skip Hop diaper bag which I've recently noticed has a defective buckle. It comes unlatched while I'm carrying it and the bag falls to the ground. Since their customer service is so poor, I've just switched to using another bag rather than to deal w/ another return."
1,I really wanted to like this...,"We got the black and white one, and I really wanted to like it-the color/design was great! Unfortunately, it did not hold up. After just a few weeks the zipper broke and fell off, so you couldn't connect the two parts together. The mesh bag is great for newborn diapers, but once the sizes get bigger they don't fit well into the compartment. The hanging cloth hook started to fray and you can't use it to hang from the diaper changing areas. I don't know if it was just a defect on mine, but the wipes case would only go into its compartment at an angle, which was hard when you are changing your baby. Altogether very disappointing."
1,Falls apart at the seams!,I was disappointed that this bag fell apart after less than two weeks of use. Skip Hop refused to repair or replace it. Why pay a premium price for a product when the company does not stand behind it?
1,Terrible customer service and terrible product,This item looks great but is cheaply made and isnt even safe for your baby. The red wipes case transfers red color to all your wipes and when you report the issue to the company they do not care. They delete your posts on their facebook wall if it doesnt favor them. Do not buy this product or any skip hop product for that matter. Your baby deserves to use products made by a company that will stand behind their product and that actually cares about the welfare of your baby.
2,Ok but not great,"So I was hoping that this bag would be the answer to the big bag vs little bag dilemma . . . Great concept, but poor execution. Both the buckle clips do not hold well, I can snap them open by just pulling on the flap instead of actually pushing the buckle together - not great if you plan to attach to anything like a stroller, or even to hold the bag closed when a bit full. Also don't like how it bulks up easily with just a few items in all the compartments. Still searching for a perfect nappy wallet then . . ."
4,Handy,"SH Pronto is basically a handy product. You don' t need to carry a big back with you, if you have one. It's enough big for short trips. Anyhow, you will need a big one for longer term trips."
4,Loved it for traveling!,"This was originally purchased for an overseas trip since we knew we would be carrying all sorts of other stuff with us. It fit up to 4 size 4 diapers -- which was enough for each flight leg without having to break into our carry-ons. Once we arrived, it gave us a ""portable station"" to change our son. While traveling, it was handier than carrying a full-fledged bag. The wipes container is not very large, and it does not fit travel-size wipes well. We all liked the size of the changing pad and the fact it covered a restroom changing station well. I have also used this when my son accompanied me on a recent business trip -- it was easy to fit into my hand-carry along with a change of clothes, toys, books, and food. All in all, we were happy we purchased this."
4,"One in the bedroom, one in the diaper bag","I love this changing kit!I keep one in my bedroom. When my son sleeps with us, we don't need to go back to the changing table in his room. We change him right on the bed. We can wipe up any poo that gets out of the diaper. If he manages to spray, it's okay. We can wipe it up after we change him in continue with our much needed sleep.I keep a second one in our diaper bag that we take on outings. I removed the purse-like pouch from it. It's useless. There's not enough room for multiple diapers. You can't hold much of anything in the zipper compartment if you put diapers in there. So as a stand alone bag?... Not going to happen. Even on your short trips you need somewhere for your keys, ID, and cash."
2,too big,"This thing is too big for what it accomplishes. It could be much more compact. JJ Cole makes a better, smaller one."
4,Great Idea,"If you have ever been somewhere with your child and didn't want to lug your entire diaper bag into a public bathroom stall, this is the product for you! No more deciding where to put your diaper bag (or having to place it on a nasty floor - yuck!). The pronto holds all your diaper essentials so you can leave your bag and just bring the bare essentials into the changing area."
5,The only changer we use,"We are extremely pleased with this product.We have little space and were not excited about getting a traditional changing table/pad only to get rid of it in 2 years. So we use the Skip-Hop Pronto on the floor for changing diapers at home. Since we have hardwood floors, we have placed a folded-over towel under the Pronto to provide a little padding and thermal insulation. Since baby is on the floor, we never have to worry about her squirming and falling. The changing surface is nice and large --- other parents have commented jealously on this changer's generous surface area.When we go out, we just fold up this changer and toss it in my (large) purse. We have never used the plastic wipes holder; when we are on the go, we just stash a 'refill' pouch pf wipes in the appropriately sized pocket.I have used the folded Pronto to support my baby while breastfeeding on-the-go.After 8 weeks, we have not noticed any defects in workmanship, such as unraveling seams mentioned by others."
3,Just okay...,"We really liked the design of this changing pad and still use it occasionally. We started using it when our son was a newborn. We would change his diaper on this in the living room. It has no padding in the pad which makes it more compact, but certainly doesn't make it comfortable. I like that the pad is a wipeable, non-porous fabric, but that also means it's cold and plastic-y feeling for your baby. We started using it in the car, but it was too much of a hassle to get out and set up each time we wanted to change a diaper. Now, we just lay down a hand towel most of the time. The wipes case is very slim, hard to open, and the wipes dry out if they aren't used quickly enough. This may be a good option for some folks that might be using it on a daily basis and need a compact diaper changing station, but it didn't really work very well for us."
5,Perfect,"I have a stroller that traps everything in the basket when the car seat is attached. I bought this to clip on to the handle. It is fantastic! I just clip and go and keep the bulky diaper bag in the car ""just in case."" Love the quality and the style."
1,Can't Really Say,"I can't really say whether this product was ""good"" or not, because when it arrived, it was a month past the expiration date. When I called Amazon, they said they'd send me a new batch, but once again the product received was expired. I have yet to order again, but maybe three's a charm...?"
2,Badly Bound Book,"While the usefulness of the content of this book is debatable, there is one issue which can't be overlooked - the inadequacy of its binding.The book began to disintegrate a couple of days after I received it; the spine cracked and the pages started to come loose. I commented upon this on the Adobe User Forum and was immediately accused of being heavy-handed and careless, however an employee of Adobe came back with this response, '...Dan Gray is aware of the binding issue of his book'. So, I didn't just make this up.Just be aware that if you purchase from the current batch of copies, you too may find yourself with a cover and a large heap of confetti."
5,see how america began,"you dont miss what you have, untill its gone, i didnt realize how much our world has changed untill i watched this series, i am 58 years old so i have lived through a lot of the landmark decisions and the changes, when they took prayer out of schools the kids started killing each other first with fists then with cruel words then with guns."
1,Don't buy this coffeemaker!,"The problem we had with this one is that it would brew coffee way too fast--the coffee tasted like water! In order to get a decent tasting cup, we had to double the amount of coffee grinds we put in the filter... and of course this gets expensive. I was taken by the cool design of this coffeemaker, but soooo dissapointed by its performance I ended up going and buying a Mr.Coffee soon afterwards (it works great!). You may save 10$ buying the Black and Decker instead of Mr. Coffee, but you will spend so much more in coffee grinds that it isn't worth it!!! Don't buy this coffeemaker!"
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"This is a LOUSY coffee maker. It's less than two months oldand since the very beginning has steamed and spit excessively,as well as brewing VERY slowly. This morning it took an hourto brew 10 cups! Cleaning, per the manufacturer's instructionshas not helped at all. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,It's a coffee machine and it makes coffee,I bought this to replace the same model which died after around 5 years of use. I give it 4 stars because I think it should have lasted longer given that it was not used every day. I chose this because I thought if the carafe broke I would have a spare seeing as they cost almost as much as a new machine. The feature I like is the fact that the hot water syphon hinges out the way with the lid. Also the lid stays up on it's own which is helpful. The carafe handle seems quite sturdy.
3,slight false advertising,"WARNING! this item is not accuratly represented here on amazon! in the product data section is says ""YES"" where it states if there is a timer. but this item does NOT have a timer! the main reason i chose this model (aside from price) is because it had a timer and i was quite dissapointed to see it does not actually have one. since this was not something that could be found out until it was opened, i am only eligible for a partial refund which i do not think is fair since it is THEIR fault it was misrepresented. i am not a happy camper. had they correctly stated there was no timer i would have gotten a different coffee maker."
2,Poor Design,"The coffee pot dribbles as you pour coffee and while filling the water resevoir in the back of the coffee maker. The condensation on the bottom of the lid drips into the resevoir in the back of the coffee maker, so it also sprays steam and hot water on you as you empty the coffee grounds - do NOT buy this coffee maker."
3,"Works well at first, but konks out quickly.","For the money, this coffeemaker seemed like a good deal. But, we drink alot of coffee, and unfortunately, it slowly stopped working as well. the pause and brew feature quit after about 3 weeks as did the auto turn off plate feature. It still makes coffee quickly, but not what we needed."
1,Poor product,"We love our coffee and it's not unusual to go through coffee makers quickly. Withen the past 4 months I have bought 2 Black & Decker coffee makers. The first one was a CM100 series. It leaked like a sieve when pouring so I decided to use it as a ""back up"" and get a new one. I then purchased the DCM2000 series. Quite disappointed to find the same problem. Not only does it also make a mess when pouring but because we weren't diligent wiping off the bottom after every use, the finish is coming off the hot plate.I won't buy this brand again."
2,"Problems Fixed - Only Temporarily, As tit Turned Out","Gotta say that I think B & D have done some re-engineering on this item since these initial reviews were written, based on all the problems which I haven't experienced in the week since I've purchased this. The brew-interrupt works fine, the heating element doesn't keep working after the water has gone through, and the spout on the coffee pot itself works perfectly. Might also note that some of these reviews really refer to another model. This has no timer on it. You turn it on, you turn it off. And, at least for me, everything works perfectly.Update 10/24/2011 - coffeemaker died after only three years...back to Mr. Coffee"
1,Poor quality,"Our first Black & Decker coffee maker didn't even last a year. . . the water pump stopped working. We took it back to Wal-Mart for a replacement and was sorely disappointed that the new Black & Decker carafe dripped no matter how careful or slowly we poured. It's strange because it looked like the same design as the last one which didn't leak. Back to Wal-Mart for our money back. Now we are wondering if there is a coffee maker out there that can make a good, hot cup of coffee that is convenient, easy to use & clean, drip free and still reasonably priced. Also bought a Black & Decker iron that leaks like a sieve. Perhaps B & D needs to go back to the drawing board and design products that are leak proof!"
2,"After ten years , I bought a second unit",for simple functional serviceability this is the best value in coffeemakersI noted a stronger design in this carafe over the original model of a decade ago.NB: I dropped and broke the carafe of the first unit
2,Didn't last two years,"Bought 10/10/08, died 8/20/10. Switch lights, but it doesn't make coffee. Either bad switch or bad heating element. 1 year warranty, so made a claim with my credit card company.You should note that this is a non-programmable coffee maker with a glass carafe. Reviews noting it's programmable are for another product.The heating plate discolored and shows scratches quite soon, and looks horrible when the carafe is not on it.Thought we'd gotten a good deal at $17.99 (Kmart in 2008), but it didn't make two years."
1,This is NOT the coffee maker you're looking for,"From the very beginning, this machine didn't brew properly, little pieces of white plastic (?) settling down at the bottom of the carafe every so often. Now 4 months 4 days after I purchased it, it won't brew at all. It cost a bit too much for it to give out after such a short period of time. I don't expect much from a $10 coffee maker, but this one was $25. The return policy requires you to have the original box, the packaging receipt, and pay for return shipping, and in return I will receive a ""partial refund."" Really? After all that, I'd like a complete refund, please."
1,Coffee maker with a time limit,"I originally chose this coffeemaker because it had a high rating in Consumer Reports. My coffee maker worked great for six months. Then the light on the switch would turn on & off, nothing else. I called Applica and was informed that it would cost me $5.00 for them to process my warranty claim. That's not what I call good customer relations.Too bad these reviews weren't available before I bought it!"
1,SmartBrew Unreliable Fuse,"This was a great coffee maker until it stopped working. The design is simple with a carafe that is solid and doesn't drip when coffee is poured. The price was good with a top brand name. Mine worked for five months.After many hours of internet searching I find that, according to posts more than 5 years old, a common problem has been that the ""thermal fuses"" stop working (one 240 & one 216). One day I turned on the coffee maker and nothing happened. Onethermal fuseis $1.25. Having the repairs done is more than the coffee maker is worth to me.A sad coffee lover,Rick"
1,It sucks!,"It worked well at first. Then the glass pot shattered in the dishwasher. The replacement pot was about 80% of the price of the coffee maker. About a week after spending all that cash on the new pot the switch busted. First the thing wouldn't turn off. A few days later it wouldn't turn on. Then the switch finally shorted out, started burning and the smell of burning coffee maker plastic filled the kitchen. Now I'm stuck with a really expensive replacement coffee pot that only fits a crappy and torched coffee maker."
1,Disappointed,"I am so disappointed in Black & Decker. I thought how can I go wrong buying a product with their name on it. Boy, was I mistaken. Someone else mentioned the same issue I had with the crackling and popping. Sounded like it could catch on fire any minute. The clock would not keep correct time. It was always 4 hours behind so I couldn't use the timer. I brought it back to the store thinking I just got a defective one and unfortunately exchanged it for another one. Amazingly, same exact problem. Clock always off by 4 hours and snap, crackle, pop. Returned it again. No more B&D for me."
3,Not for engineers,"This book is not good for technical people (they should read Thomas Starr ""Understanding Digital Subscriber Line Technology"" as the best technical reference book), but this may be a good one for marketing and management people, and for general reading."
2,Does anyone proofread anymore?,"This book is the most atrociously 'edited' book I've encountered in years. It wouldn't be so bad were it just grammar and punctuation. No, instead, you'll find numerous errors with inconsistent nomenclature, tables, and so on, all of which can't help but confuse one who is encountering the material for the first time."
4,Changing Muslims Through Islam,"It's pretty hard to describe what this book is: Travel journalism, satire, politics, philosophy and even comedy. It's so funny I burst out laughing reading it, people looking at me in the bus like I'm a weirdo. But it's also very serious. The author is a Muslim and he takes Islam very seriously. At the same time, he wants to change the Muslim world through descriptions and criticisms of Muslim practices.The book takes place over a few weeks, set in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, before 9/11. It's the actual story of the author as he travels through two Muslim countries right as he graduates out of high school. This book is really, really worth reading if you don't know much about Islam and want to understand it from a serious but still amusing perspective, or if you're a Muslim who wants to know why the Islamic world is in such horrible straits these days.Recommended."
1,Rambling about a 3 week trip,"This book is more appropriate material for an online diary or blog than for printed material. The author rambled about a three week trip he took when he was a teenager and now has roughly packaged his journal in the form of a book. I bought the book based on an interview I saw of the author on a local TV channel. He sounded mature and had some insights, however in the book the author sounds extremely immature and an incapable writer.His critique of Saudi Society are very superficial as they are based on observance by an outsider who neither is familiar with the country's history, culture or language. The book is more of an account of a vacation gone sour. My advice to the author: become much more familar with your subject before trying to write and sell a book about it."
1,Poor quality,"This radiator was received with no damage to the package but was bent diagonally. After closer inspection, it was not damaged but manufactured in a distorted manner. Item was returned for a replacement. Replacement was received with no packaging damage but had a bow across the center. So it seems that this company has very poor manufacturing practices and no quality assurance. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I guess I'm one of the few people here who found the production quality and camera shots used in this video to be of such poor quality that they really detracted from the overall workout.In addition to the lousy production values, I wouldn't call the workout moderately rigorous. I wasn't expecting a high impact aerobic workout, but I did want to feel my muscles working over a sustained period of time, not in 10 second blips. My feeling is that if you're someone who is just starting a workout program, this video might be for you. But if you are used to higher levels of exertion and strength training, I think you may be disappointed."
2,Don't bother unless you're an aerobics fanatic,"I love to exercise, but am not a big fan of aerobics videos. I bought this b/c it was recommended as a good way to keep in shape throughout your pregnancy. Overall, I found the moves not physically challenging (except maybe for coordination), and the music irritating. I'm sure the instructor is much better in person, but the video performance lacks realism in her personality. It's a nice idea, but save your money and take a prenatal yoga class instead!"
2,Buns of aluminum foil,"For a morning workout that will get your heart pumping and your muscles warmed up, this video will do the job. But unfortunately, in this day of lawsuits, it seems that exercise videos are made so that the least fit of us won't become injured from over-exertion. The tape begins with an aerobic workout (not for the uncoordinated!) that DIDN'T specifically target the lower body. Following this are just a few minutes of leg work. These exercises work the quadriceps more than the ""buns."" Even during the plie moves, we weren't asked to squeeze our glutes. With the title BUNS OF STEEL, I expected some slow, intense moves that would leave my muscles burning. I think our money is better spent on a pair of light weights, used during squats and lunges. Or maybe we could rewind the tape and do the toning section four or five times in a row."
3,"Pretty dated, but an ok workout","This video is pretty dated, however, the workout is not bad. It does get your blood rate up and makes you feel energized."
3,Horrible Quality; Good Content,"First off the video is recorded on a slow speed (I guess to reduce production cost) so the quality is very bad. There is general fuzziness overall and flicker as well. I'm tempted return the tape for this reason. On the other hand, the content is good."
4,A great workout!,"I am glad I ordered this tape. Prior to this pregnancy my daughter and I went on many fastpaced walks with our jogging stroller. This was a great workout that works many areas that I could feel the next day, even with all the walking. It is not too hard or too easy. I enjoyed it and think you will too!"
4,"Great routine, but too short","This is my first pregnancy. Since my gym membership was up, I thought I'd try an at-home workout. I found this video to be too easy (although I did fall within my target heart rate every time). The steps are fun and easy to follow, but just when your getting warmed up, the aerobics portion is over. An additional 10-15 minutes would be much more satisfying. I would also prefer upper body toning in addition to lower body toning at the end. I believe this video will be more satisfying in the latter months of pregnancy (currently 6 months)."
2,Just OK,"The moves can get to be pretty confusing & are just not challenging enough. Kathy Smith's is better. Also, the instructor has a very irritating rat-like voice that gives me the willies. She bugs too when she kept saying ""double check time!"" Ugh...overall it's ok but there are better ones out there."
1,"Leisa Hart, Buns of Steel star, has a better prenatal","i adore Buns of Steel instructor Leisa Hart, i have 10 of her Steel videos, and i got her FITMAMA Prenatal video when I got pregnant and gave my Buns of Steel pregnacny video to a libray because it was old and outdate. The workout doesn;t appeal to me or anyone I know that tried, they all rave about FITMAMA, which I recommend."
5,Buns of Steel 8 Pregnancy Workout review,"I am now 8-1/2 months pregnant, and have been doing this video all through my pregnancy. I have other pregnancy videos (Austin, Smith) and they are good, but this one is by far the best. It is harder than the Smith workout, so do buy one of the easier ones to alternate, but this is a must-have video for active women who want to keep up their fitness level during their pregnancy."
2,"Okay workout, Needs improvement","Sometimes this video is hard to follow. The camera angles can be distracting. Once you learn the workout, it does its job. I purchased this and the Kathy Smith pregnancy workout video at the same time, and found Kathy Smith's to be more applicable and useful."
5,"Fun, Upbeat Video for any fitness level","I have been doing this video for 2 weeks and love it! It is a nice combination of low-impact aerobics and toning that will leave you feeling great. To add extra intensity, I use ankle weights for the toning at the end and do my own ""warm-up"" with light dumbells for the upper body in the beginning. I have noticed comments that it could be ""longer"" but if you have a busy schedule, 40 minutes is a good length, especially if you work.I have been working out for over 10 years and during pregnancy I think it is important to continue excercising, but not to over-do. This video can be easily enhanced early in pregnacy for extra intensity and will last throughout by maintaining a level that is comfortable for you at every stage. Along with all of the other maternity ""essentials"" - this video should rank near the top of the list."
4,Good Product.,"Not too tough, but does the trick. Good for 2nd and 3rd trimester. Too easy for 1st trimester."
5,Really enjoyed it,"I started using this tape when I was 5 months along; I'm now at 7 months. I really like this workout. The music is catchy without being annoying, and the instructor is lively but not too bubbly. It took me a few times to really get the routine down, but that makes it a good workout and not boring. There's a lot of focus on kegel exercises and abdominal and leg toning."
2,Camera man couldn't follow the routine,"I found this video difficult to follow and I got too discouraged to try it again after two or three times at it. This is a pretty traditional aerobic workout routine. The problem was that it involved a lot of quick footwork in sometimes complex combinations, and just as the instructor got going on a new series of steps the camera would zoom in on her face so that I couldn't even see her feet at all! This left me standing there waiting for the camera to pan back out to a wider shot, which totally interrupted the flow of my workout."
2,A little disappointed,"I was disappointed in this video. I have been a fan of the Buns of Steel tapes for years and expected the same type of workout (only modified) out of this one. I guess I was expecting more of a leg/buns workout and this was mostly light aerobics and ""some"" leg work. I think if you are looking for a light aerobics tape for pregnancy, then this is a good one. I do like the instructor. But, for those of you who are used to the Buns of Steel series and expect a lower body workout, you may be disappointed too. (Hey, it says BUNS of steel!!)"
1,Beware -- Not for the uncoordinated!!,"I am seven months pregnant and tried this video for the first and last time a few weeks ago. I am not terribly fitness savvy and found the steps so incredibly irritating! I was concentrating so hard I was falling over my own feet. The videography was done in such a way that they would be changing steps, but only showing arms. This was most frustrating to me. I found Redbook's Pregnancy Video so much more pleasant."
3,Not much BUNS,"I'm disappointed. This tape has 2/3 cardio and warm-up but only 1/3 buns workout. I was very disappointed the first time I used it and fast forward my VCR to the ""buns"" part. I use this after I've done the Denise Austin pregnancy video since that warms me up and gives me better exercises -- I use this one as a finisher, so to speak."
4,Good fantasy source book.,"This book is loaded with information on various classes of spells for the Hero System. The classes of spell are diverse and well-described, with numerous variants of each spell pre-made. If you are running a fantasy campaign, this book is a must. Be warned, however, that the spells in this book are not as useful for mystical superhero type campaigns. All of the spells listed have a clear swords & sorcery flavor. That is to say, Dr. Strange does not get his spells from this book."
1,An 'eh' game.....,"This game is pretty lame.......Trust Jiggy on this one. Some of the moves are excecuted quite strangely, and character move variety is virtually nonexistent. Thunder would be a better buy, but not by much......"
2,Not good study material for Win2K server exam,"I really don't want to blame this book for not helping me pass the server exam. But, the truth is I failed. I did pretty good on the practice exam and I was convinced that I would pass the exam. Of course, this is not my only book to prepare for the exam, only for reality check. The only problem I see is that it did not point me to the right direction, unlike the Win2K Professional book of the same series (which help me passed the 70-210 exam).I will not recommend anyone to use this book for 70-215. The practice exam won't help you for the exam at all."
3,book club consensus,"Interesting history of TV journalism but there was just so little emotional content the group all wished it was a biography rather than an autobiography. Boomers will recognize most of the names of the reported on characters and in some ways it was an international ""We didn't start the Fire"".Peter G."
2,Brembos but pictures are misleading,"These are indeed Brembo rotors. BUT, the picture above is misleading. These are solid disc brake rotors, NOT drilled. It would have been good to know this before I ordered it."
2,"Much anticipation, major disappointment","It feels like they're coasting. Much of the footage is recycled from the previously aired special about the round the world in 100 hours trip. No new performance footage, weak menu (only six chapter access points), tiny postcard still gallery, no real extras (unless there are Easter Eggs hidden somewhere), and none of the long released videos from the album (the less said about the ""special live video"" that closes the disc, the better; the soundtrack is the album cut and the editing on the images is just sloppy, bordering on amateurish--probably why it didn't rate a chapter of its own). The interviews are fun, the scenery is pretty, the transfer is good, the sound is fine, but... shrug. It might have been exciting if it were released along with the album, but after all the delays, there's really no excuse for something this lackluster and crashingly mediocre. And those are two adjectives I never expected to associate with BSB."
3,Great Bonus Footage - Not much singing,"Both of my children are big BSB fans. They love to hear them sing. We bought this DVD thinking that it was like the television show with some live performance footage. This is not a ""singing"" video. It is just a narrative of the guys on the 100 hours tour. The tour footage is really interesting, and the ""behind the scenes"" look at their tour, airplane, fan gatherings is also worth a look. However, if you want to see the BSB actually singing (concerts or videos), this is not the DVD to buy. I wish I would have looked at the reviews here before we spent money on this one!"
1,Let's keep this simple -,"This is a low-quality get-rich-quick release of poor-quality prints dubbed with poor-quality soundtracks and released to any dummy with a wallet and no common sense. If you wish to join the hordes of shills who regularly get ripped off with low-quality garbage, then go ahead. Make a rip-off artist rich today."
2,Web site cookbook,Not really the beginners manual I was looking for. It gets pretty deep pretty quick and I've programmed in older languages.
4,Beading tweezers,"I received this item on time and in good condition. They are just fine for the job for which I purchased them, which was to aid in undoing knots and other problem solving while beading, usually with seed beads"
4,A well written and thought provoking work.,"I have to admit, I at first purchased this book because the author had the same last name as mine! After reading it, though, I found much of the content extremely enlightening. As an orthodox Jew, I pray a lot--three times a day to be exact! Having literature that focuses on the sheer art of prayer is tremendously helpful. All too often we say words bereft of any meaning or clearity. This book examines the seemingly ""mundane"" verses by uncovering their historical and cultural significance. I recommend this book not only to fellow synagogue attenders but to anyone curious about the Jewish religion."
3,I'm still trying to work this one out....,"The plot is just bizarre. I don't know if I can even do it justice. We have a reporter for a CNN-style news station in the fluff piece area who gets involved with bonobo chimps, a female dominant species, and a company that is using them to find a way of controlling people through pheremone warfare. People are beaten, people are murdered. People come back from the dead. People sell pot from their car and identify themselves only with a number and not a name. Oy vey...maybe I need to read it again with fresh eyes..."
4,Stay with it,"Have found this series to be fun and inventive but had trouble getting into this book. Stay, with it though, because the second half is a romp and a half and fastly paced. Robin Hudson's neverending analysis of her boyfriends - right or wrong - are captivating and carry the ring of truth for all of us no longer in our 30s and thoroughly involved in combining the memories of our youth with the realities of our 40s. Her calm acceptance of Murphy's Law as the most powerful force in her life gives us all hope as we trudge along in our own lives."
3,Good... but not as good as the previous books.,"The four Robin Hudson books has prompted me to think of Sparkle Hayter as one of my favourite authors. Still, 'The Last Manly Man' didn't seem quite as entertaining as the previous books.I guessed where Hayter was going before she got there in most cases, and a good number of jokes just didn't do it for me. Robin herself remained in true form, but the supporting cast seemed a bit off... although I did enjoy learning that her neighbour wasn't quite as crazy as she has seemed in previous books.Still, I will be on the look-out for the next Robin Hudson mystery, feeling confident that Hayter will come back around to where she was with ""What's a Girl Gotta Do"" and ""Revenge of the Cootie Girls."""
4,An improvement over Revenge of The Cootie Girls...,"But a step below What's a Girl Gotta Do and Nice Girls Finish Last. A good book, but not as side splittingly funny as the first two in the series. Let's hope Sparkle is back to her old style in the new book!"
4,Fascination,"This book provides lots of insight as to why people find Area 51 so fascinating, but doesn' really draw any conclusions.Phil Patton interviews every type of person interested in the workings of the Air Force's facility at Groom Lake, from aviation buffs to ""youfers,"" all the while maintaining objectivity. He doesn't seek to judge the conspiracty theorists, but rather gives a basic history of black projects in general and Area 51 in particular.I found it an easy and fun read. If you're at all interested in the United States' most secret military facility, black projects or secret aircraft, this is a good read."
3,"Good, not great; informative, not objective","I began this book hoping for an objective look at the UFO phenomenon; but it quickly became apparent that Patton had no such intention. For him, the whole thing is nonsense, a modern-day mythology fit only for cultists and fanatics. Ho-hum. On the other hand, the background material he provides on aircraft research and developement is fascinating and worth the ride itself. (I wonder if Patton has read, or is aware of, Colonel Philip Corso's book, The Day After Roswell? How would he place Corso's revelations in his r-&-d timeline?) The book is well-written but strangely organized: it jumps about seemingly at random from topic to topic and from place to place, often within the same chapter. But after reading it, you will feel that you spent a few days driving around Nevada and California with him; and if he doesn't always stop off where you'd like, you do still get to see some beautiful country and hear some pretty good stories."
2,Disapointed,"The author gets way of course on various subjects. The book, in my opinion, is a bore. I have read several publications on area 51 and this book was a real struggle. Very little substance and a lot of hype. I couldn't finish it. The silly cover should have tipped me off..."
3,Full of details but lacking style,"Pattons book offers an in depth look at the history of black projects developed at Area 51. Aviation buffs will probably find this interesting but the rest of us will just be left longing for something more. The only new revelation Dreamland brings is its attempt to link the infamous Roswell crash to Area 51. The major failing in this book is that Dreamland is told without any conviction or style, which despite all the information in offers, makes it a rather dull read. For a much more personal and entertaining book on the subject I recomend David Darlingtons ""Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles."""
5,An Excellent Read!,"I read this book straight through one weekend hardly able to put it down. Patton provides, in ""Wired"" style, a balanced history of ""Area 51."""
1,Absolute Nightmare,"I am nearly completed reading this atrocious book and as frustrated as I am, I need to continue since exam date is hovering ever so close. While some chapters do a fantastic job of explaining the tediously technical, other chapters appear to be cut and pasted from Cisco's own CCO. I could have done just as well and saved myself some money but I purchased a book hoping to find clarification of difficult topics. Want to know more about ISDN, Frame Relay and X.25? Go elsewhere! Labs without explanation, errors galore, even questions that editors forgot to review! Save your money!"
3,Too many errors,"I read this book and passed the test on the first try, but half of the questions on the test weren't even covered in this book. That along with the ridiculous amount of grammatical errors in this book made it the last one from this publisher that I will buy.Bottom line: You can pass the test with this book if you know all the information in it, but your passing score will be barely passing."
4,Remote Access study Guide.,Excellent reference material to reinforce my preparation for the BCRAN test. I usually used several books for my review. I have no complaint for ... I paid way back in Dec. 2000.
4,Decent coverage; better than most,"Not the best computer book in the world, but well written and true to exam objectives."
4,From The Inside Flap:,"The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was a 19th-Century group of dissident artists who rejected the conventional artistic opinions of the academic establishment and sought inspiration from the arts, and later the crafts, of the Middle Ages. The Brotherhood consisted of seven members: Dante Gabriel and William Michael Rossetti, John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, F. G. Stephens, James Collinson and Thomas Woolner, together wiht a handful of fellow-travelers, among them Burne-Jones and William Morris. Other artists were strongly influenced by - or influenced - the movement, such as John Ruskin. Their story is one of rebellion and re-definition of aesthetics."
4,A Child's Imagination,My son loves the tie. It completes his Harry Potter look. It is brilliant. This was unavailable in Australia and it was great to be able to purchase this for him. His imagination and creativity is amazing with the help of this complete outfit.
5,Love it,Both my daughter and I are HP fans. I bought this tie as a little suprise for my witch in training. She LOVES it! Now she's having to share it with her girlfriends. Thanks!
2,No emblem on real Gryffindor tie,"The real Gryffindor tie does not have an emblem on it. Also the color are gold and crimson, not gold and plum."
1,I never got my order,"Hi!, I was trying to write a private letter and not a review but aparently there's not an option for that... my tracking info says that my product has been left in the front door but I never got it. I dont know if it was stolen or it just simply got losted. Thank you"
3,It is ok quality but the color.,The color is the only thing to sugest. Is not right.Because is purple not red. So it does not work for the very acurated custom
1,"It's ok, but colors are a bit off.","It's made ok, but the colors are a little off. A bit too much purple in lighting. It works for me as a last minute costume, but definitely not for cosplay."
4,Colors and size good for an adult,"I got this for my son (he's 21) when we went to the Potter movie marathon this summer. The tie's a teeny bit short for an adult but he was able to wear it just fine. His costume mimicked the Hogwart's school uniform images, so he had a V-neck sweater under his robes. You couldn't see the whole tie anyway in that case. If he'd wanted to wear just a button-down shirt it'd have been a bit short. But it looked great; we were happy with the material and the color."
3,It's Purple :'(,"Please trust me when I say, it's PURPLE and gold. In certain lighting it does look burgandy, but if you compare it to someone who has a real burgandy/scarlett/red and gold Gryffindor scarf that are the right colors, it will surley look purple. I had no choice since the premiere was coming up. I'm still happy with my purchase, just be warned, it is a deep deep burgandy/purple, with emphasis on the purple. It still is a licensed Warner Bros. product, I just can't understand why they can't make it the right colors. I still had fun that night, and plan on buying a tie with the right colors when I come across it."
4,Perfectly good tie,"I see why some people have said this is purple-y, but to be honest, so were the ones in the later movies. It might be a little off (and when I say a little, I mean a little), but not enough to be upset about. This is a perfectly good tie and was generally better quality than expected. If you're worried people will think you're not ""a true fan"" as has been suggested, I wouldn't worry about it. In my opinion, a true fan would know that there is zero evidence in the books that they ever even wore ties. Regardless, this is the best replica of the Gryffindor tie worn in the later movies that I have seen. Is it perfect? No. Is it worth buying? Yes."
3,Gryffindor Necktie,"The Gryffindor Necktie is well-made and very authentic looking, but, as some other reviewers have pointed out, looks more purple than maroon in some lights."
3,Gryffindor necktie,"I was a Hogwarts instructor for Halloween and wanted to look like being from the house of Gryffindor so I bought the tie to match my cloak, white shirt, black pants, etc. The tie really pulled the costume together.Pros: I really liked how it was a full-size men's tie and not a clip on. The stripe pattern was great, just like the movie. The price was also good as similar ties like from the WB store were much more.Cons: The tie didn't have the Gryffindor crest at the bottom. The picture shows a maroon tie with gold stripes, but it's more of a dark purple.I would have given the tie 5 stars in more categories but the color is off. I found a couple other places online that sold a deep red or maroon tie instead but they were backordered."
3,Color Was Off,"Basic tie with logo printed at the bottom.The product itself was good enough, for the cost, but the colors were definitely purple and yellow - not burgundy and gold. A little disappointing, but I'm fairly sure no one but me noticed on Halloween."
1,Not a good Replica,I bought this Tie to wear as a teacher. Thought the kids would like the idea that I can relate to them more. The tie came in the mail and it was made of good material. However i sent it back due to the fact the color was more purple than red. Didn't appeal to me seeing most Gryffindor colors are brighter red than purple.
1,Definitely Purple,"It is a nice tie, but there is not a trace of red. It'd probably be better to buy a generic red and gold tie..."
1,Misleading,"Colors are NOT Gryffindor colors. It's more of a deep purple. It cost cheap but do not expect actual Hogwarts clothing. The product itself is in great condition and no hassle but again, NOT actual Harry Potter tie."
1,Not burgundy,"I received this tie with high expectations because the reviews here had said that it was true Gryffindor burgundy, but in fact, it is not. As similar reviews claim, the tie is PURPLE, not burgundy. I was very disappointed and will be returning the tie as soon as possible and am hoping to find a replacement."
3,install it before 30 day return window,"I received one that turned out to be defective. It was past the 30 day return window, so I was stuck with it. Be sure to install and check for ""popping"" or noisy play in the pawls/bearings before the return window. package was a little checked up, but still looked ok, live and learn.(noisy when pedaling under load, which should be silent...ticking during coasting is normal and expected, this was abnormal inconsistent irritating noise that vibrated through the bike!!! pop pop creak pop)"
5,Most inspirational small business book I've read!,"After reading this book, I have a better idea of where I want to take my small business. The companies profiled are very inspiring. Donna highlighted not only what these business owners did right, but what some of their stumbling blocks were, and how they overcame them. I'll be buying this book for all my key staff members to read."
3,Good gloves for the money,"An excellent value, as they serve the intended purpose. Not a really good fit, but for the money it's worth it."
5,Killing Rain,Barry Eisler's Hard Rain is Hard and gritty in plot and action. One of the few reads that one is really able to immerse oneself completely with the characters and story line. If Mr. Eisler can maintain this level of writing he most definitely will have a fan for life.
5,The Rain Saga Continues,"This is the fourth book in the John Rain series. The book continues the changes John Rain has been going through over the past three books, and uses the new characters introduced in the last book. It also changes POV in a departure from the first person limited perspective only of the first three books.In this one, Rain botches a hit and now his head is on the block. He has to fix the hit, escape from the group who want him dead, and protect his new friends - and the final twist changes everything for Rain.I finished this one in three days. I'm now reading the next one in the series, The Last Assassin. I Highly Recommend this series.Enjoy."
5,KILLING RAIN,"THIS BEING THR FIRST BOOK I READ BY THIS AUTHOR, I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT. I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN UNTIL THE END."
2,A lack of dramatic tension,"This suspense novel about CIA contract assassins attempts to take on a larger question, namely, how does one leave a life of politically necessary murder to become wholly human? The characters are not believable, nor are they compelling, as they sit around like dilettantes in a Harvard coffee bar talking about their feelings and having moral crises over snuffing lives. Eisler is convincing when he writes about combat, but the attempt to put a mysterious plot in here fails, as does an attempt to make these characters be either the animal within or an intellectualization of killing. If your reading is constantly interrupted by announcements over an airport PA, you're tired and totally bored, it might cut it, but otherwise..."
1,BORING !!!,"Either this author is a VERY slow starter or his product is extremely boring. I liked the sound of the premise so much I bought four (4) of his novels. After two chapters, I put the first one down, never to return."
1,This book is awful,"I read and listen to a lot of Vince Flynn, Neslon DeMille, Brad Thor, Robert Ludlum and this author came up as comparable in the book searches. I started listening to the unabridged CD of this and MADE myself stick with it for 3 disks when I had to stop. This is the worst, most grade school level book I have listened to in ages. It is simply awful and having a narrator that has a low gruff voice for a small man of asian heritage is a terrible choice as well. I wish I could get my money back."
3,Unthrilling ...,"The shift from an exclusively first person narrative in #4 effectively robs the story of the dramatic tension which permits it actually to 'thrill'. Throughout, we not only know what is going to happen, but also why; we're being spoonfed strained vegetables when we want to be challenged with raw meat.Also, the limit beyond which Rain's saintly slayer's psyche loses all credibility was passed well before his almost fatal hesitation in the opening sequence; Eisler would do better to concentrate on the moral quandaries sometimes involved in effectively defending liberal democratic societies, and try to avoid overtly providing explanations and solutions."
5,enjoy the mystery,good John Rain book. As always keeps you thinking. Nice escape read and learn some world geography and history as well.
4,I like Kenny's stories,I felt the book was interesting in that Kenny talks about conservation in a simple manner. He is an excellent story teller. The book also gives interesting insights into how people made a living along the Mississippi in earlier times.
3,Its what you get for the Money,Very snug fit. Almost doesn't fit. It makes it hard to use the key board or touch screen. The Clip work great. The lock option for the clip is nice. I still haven't found a case I love.
3,A satisfactory choice for WinArch II,"This volume is clear and easy to read. The chapters are well laid out and very modular. I do not recommend the book as a source of information. The subject matter is way to broad for a few hundred pages. But, for an overview and for passing the exam it is just the ticket. I studied each chapter, did the sample questions, reviewed what I got wrong and passed the exam with a good grade."
3,"Good primer, but not enough to pass the test","Before reading this book, I had 2 1/2 years experience in Access, and been working sporadically in VB (3/4/5) for the same amount of time. This book is an excellent introduction to the topics covered on the Windows Archtiecture II exam, however I feel that studying for the VB5 exam in many ways was as useful, if not more so, than this book. This book also tends to be weak on certain issues such as normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), Internationalization and User Interface issues. And of course, the questions at the end of the chapter look like nothing on the actual test. However, this book in conjuction with testing software (I used SelfTest, which was excellent), Visual Basic study, some of the choicer MSDN articles (especially on Code Signing) will help you pass the exam. A worthy effort on a difficult exam. My thanks to the authors."
2,No relation with dificulty of exam !!!,"The book is very clear and easy of understood, but there is not comparation with the dificulty of the exam. Even you see in the exam issues or terms not described in the book. Is a very good option to start, but you must see other sources to pass the exam."
4,This book helped me pass my MCSD!,"I found this book, as well as the test exams from Transcender, very useful in passing my MCSD. I know that Microsoft is changing the program to keep up with advances in technology but I am sure the authors will update their materials in due time. In the meanwhile I still use this book (as well as the Architecture I book) as a good reference guide in some of my consulting engagements."
5,Its all you need for todays market.,Mr. Markman has done a great job reviewing most of the assest available on the net you can use to make valid investment decsions. Also included are his own stradegies. This book is a great addition to the MoneyCentral site and the Super Model community sponsored by Microsoft. Great advice. A lively writing style. You can make money with this book. Just enough graphs and enough math to prove the points. Best book I've read since the first Motley Fool investment guide.
1,A GREAT BOOK IF YOU WANT TO LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY,I READ MARKMAN'S BOOK RIGHT AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED. I FOLLOWEDTHE INSTRUCTIONS EXPLICITLY. THE RESULT: I TURNED (...) INTO (...)! I CHECKED HIS WEB SITE AND NOW MARKMAN WON'T EVEN PUBLISH HIS RESULTS! BUYER BEWARE. THESE TECHNIQUES MAY BE VERY HAZARDOUS TO THE HEALTH OF YOUR PORTFOLIO. I THREW MY COPY OF THE BOOK AWAY. I COULDN'T SELL IT AND STILL FEEL LIKE AN ETHICAL PERSON.
2,Second Rate,"This guy has cost a lot of people a lot of money in the stock market. Fortunately I wasn't one of them. And yes it was their fault instead of his. But many are seduced by his methods since the implication is that winnning stocks may be selected by purely mechanical methods. The sections that deal specifically with the internet and how to find information are ok but the infomation is easily available elsewhere. The rest is not really up to par but will probably pass most people's inspection. Please just be skeptical and wise and realize that to take advantage of mechanical stock picking schemes requires a great deal of money or a fund of some kind. Statistically one may make money on the pot but buying a highly rated subset is seldom wise.Also, using a little money to buy the pot almost always results in unacceptable transaction costs."
2,copycat,"having bought Eckett's original book of the same title and patel's far superior Trading Online, this effort is a copy of the other two.Come on, you need a real online trader writing a book like Eckett or Patel not a journalist cashing in."
2,Don't buy this if you're a Mac user,"16 pages into the book and I find I can't even try out the guy's premises (models) because I don't have Windows. The Finder software, downloadable for free, is Windows only. (He tells Mac users to go to the library or a friend.) Shouldn't 'online' imply 'multi-platform'? The title of this book is misleading! I should've noticed the publisher as well. Oh well, $20 down the drain, and back to the drawing board."
5,Great racing lore,This book was hard to put down. I found many little tidbits of information that were unknown to me before and it was genuinely entertaining. Books like this always lead to more books as it touches on things and people that you want to learn more about.
3,"A very good book, but not for Kindle","I borrowed a copy of this book from local library and really enjoyed reading. Since the content was not just for one-time reading, I felt like buying for future painting practice. Although I had bad experiences with Kindle versions of books which included charts and images, I thought this book could be different because images and colors are what this book is all about.Unfortunately, the images were so small that I could not read the characters included in those clips easily not to mention feel the delicate differences of colors.I think this is a fundamental Kindle problem. It is just a few megabytes. How can they really do better with this much of compression?I rate this item 5 stars for its original helpful content and 1 star for its Kindle publication."
4,Claudia Nice certainly is!,This book was suggested for me since I am a relatively newcomer to watercolor. The person who suggested it has been a painter and teacher for over 70 years(she is 95 and still teaches a small group). She was right its a great book for people such as myself.
5,Another fantastic entry!,"Even with a change of scenery and the crew splintered, David still crafted a riveting story for us. Learning more about the characters individually makes me so much m"
2,What A Bore,"This novel was utterly boring and not even necessary. Yes, I understand that Peter David is using the destruction of Excalibur as a way to delve into the inner thoughts and private lives of the former Excalibur crew, but unfortunately it just doesn't work. Soleta's story is moderately interesting, but after awhile it just got tedious. As for the McHenry and Kebron story, not worth the effort and often found myself skimming through for the interesting spots. One of the things that has made this series so enjoyable is the interaction between the crew. The way in which the different personalities clashed and worked out how to get along in a crunch. Of course, I'm going to continue on. I've invested too much time to give up now and I want to know what happenes to everyone."
3,More Like A Comic Book,"I am a big fan of Peter David. He's one of the best Trek writers because of his wide knowledge of the Trek universe and love for the characters that inhabit it. His ""New Frontier"" series started with a big bang, interesting plots and characters spiced up with quirky humor and inside jokes. But unfortunately with each new book that careful balance starts to disappear. No substance, just comic-book style gimmicks. This is highly evident in his latest book ""Requiem"". The Romulan plot with Lt. Soleta was great, the one saving feature of the book. But everything else detracts. Anything dealing with Si Cwan might as well have been a complete blur. While an intriguing X-Files tribute totally collapsed with a tired, old cameo and an incredible revelation about Lt. McHenry that just makes you roll your eyes."
5,At last!!!!!!,"I waited and waited and waited to find out if there was ever going to be more books like this. Then out of the blue, when I'd given up hope and left the crew of the Excaliber for gonners....Two new ones jumped right out at me off the shelf and demanded I buy them. Best thing I ever did.Peter David has taken us so many places and done so many things with these characters and I for one was glad that they didn't all perish. Soleta's quest was humourous, but also gut wrenching. Mark and Zak's predicament had me guessing all the way through. As for Si Cwan and his sister....I don't know what to think of their problems. But we all know that everything will turn out well...As long as the ship doesn't blow up again..."
1,mean without purpose,"Read if you like commas but don't be fooled. Not a story, not a study of a relationship, not a candid reveal of an unhappy woman even. It's about Andre Dubrus -- his relentless theatricality, confidently dominating maleness, his tragic injuries, but even the loud impact and potential subtlety of writing of those things is drowned out by his ex-wife's acid resentments which read like immaturity or of a narrowly lived life or perhaps cruelty. She writes about how he was reduced and diminished by the car accident yet seems to hate him for the stature and scale he'd occupied for most of their marriage, then walks out when he's reduced. I can't find the wholeness or logic of the story. And the heartlessness doesn't feel like honesty or reality was achieved in risking the expression. Jesus, the private occurrences in and on toilets shared in such a nasty way? Lacking in humility."
5,wonderful read,"I really loved ""A Year and A Day"". It was a wonderfully moving novel that really took me back in time to a kinder world. Who wouldn't have wanted to grow up in a small mid-western town? I found the charecters to be interesting and well developed. I enjoyed the rich details of the life Alice and her family lead - both happy and sad. I was glad that Mama didn't tell her everything she wanted to know. I wished that the book would have taken a year and a day to read because I really enjoyed being part of Alice's life. I liked this book better than the Lovely Bones."
1,supermarket pasta salad.,"A Year and a Day is the typical, if not tired renditon of a coming of age teenage daugter and her coming of age brother dealing with the inexplicable suicide of their mother. Said mother 'speaks' to the daughter, espousing superficial, mostly, irrevalent insight and Hallmark-isms that she seemingly was unable to produce when alive. The genuineness of the book would have been enhanced by deleting the deceased mothers verbage, which was trite and poorly developed, and extremely sacchrine. I read to the end only to find out why the mother was in such despair and I was sorely disappointed."
2,seems like a year to finish,"As an enthusiastic motivated reader who enjoys books from nearly ever genre (as well as those that defy such labels), I found this book sorely dissappointing. And I didn't even expect that much to begin with.When the dead Mama returns to give out advice and information to her struggling daughter, it becomes clear that not only does Mama have nothing of any import to say (though she says it for pages upon pages) but that she's really wanting us, the readers, to take her advice to heart. The trouble is, the belaboured advice never hits upon any subject matter more deep or profound than comments on makeup, boys, family squabbles, and the like.The small-town descriptive passages are sweet and lovely, if you like that sort of thing. But ultimately this redemption isn't enough to make this book compelling."
2,have to agree with the majority on this,"I really wanted this timer to work better than most of the reviews said it would, because it's too cute and goes with the colors in my kitchen (I bought the red one). It worked okay for about two months, and then completely stopped working. Oh well..."
2,"Terrible, bad quality.. it doesn't even work well !","The stars rated are only for looks.. ít's quite cute, and use only as decoration, since the alarm doesn't even sound loud enough, if it sounds.. don't waste you money on this."
3,The older the better!!,My daughter is 5 and still has great difficulty but does with us helping and it does not spring just a small jump. She does love the frog sound it makes and loves that it is a frog. : *)
5,Use It As A Nortel Networks Certification Study Guide!,I work at Nortel Networks and this book is becoming quite popular within Nortel as a reference book and certification study guide. Just today I spoke with a Technical Support Engineer who failed the Nortel Networks Accelar certification exam last week. Then he read over the Accelar and Bridging sections of the Nortel Networks: The Complete Reference book and passed the test the second time around!
5,Good for beginners and experts,"We use this huge reference within our company... and we don't even use Nortel equipment! Our company deals with network design issues daily, and the first few chapters make a great study guide for new-hires who are trying to grasp the whole spectrum of networking technology at once. The rest of the book quickly delves into specifics that benefit the more advanced reader... overall, this book was a great buy!"
4,Works for me,"I have a habit in losing track of the time when I'm working in the garden or on some project. I set this timer, put in around my neck and now I don't have to worry about stopping in time to make some appointment."
2,Needs a cover over the buttons!!,"I got this to set timer and wear around my neck to keep track of time of whatever I am doing (surfing internet, cooking, cleaning, etc) It has NO cover over the buttons so anytime I lean against something it gets pinched in between my chest and whatever I'm leaning on and pushes all the buttons and changes the settings. Last week in church, I had it in my purse and my 5 yr old accidentally sat on my purse, well it turned it on and the stupid thing started beeping and going off -- I had to leave my seat and hunt it down in my purse. Not the end of the world but very annoying. But it really defeats the purpose of why I got it if I'm accidentally changing the settings and time on it. On the up side, it has a nice large display and thankfully it has a magnet so it is now on my refrigerator to use as a 2nd timer when I stay in the kitchen to cook. If it had a plastic sleeve to slide over it to keep from changing the buttons then it would probably be perfect."
4,Love these timers,"I have searched and searched for an easy-to-use, sturdy timer. This product is the best that I have found. You can punch in your exact time instead of having to wait for the timer to count up as you press the buttons.We use them commercially in our two bakeries, and they are great. One small drawback - they don't sit exactly straight due to the placement of the magnet on the back."
4,Easy to use!,"Affordable and easy to use. Magnet on the back so I can leave it on the fridge when not in use. I bought this to specifically use as a ""necklace"" when cooking. My oven timer is like a fire alarm and was really bugging me - I like that this timer is loud enough to notice, but not jarring and annoying like the oven timer. I use the stopwatch feature more often than I thought I would - so that's a great bonus. The only thing I would like is a little stand if I wanted to keep it on the counter. It's actually wide enough to stand on the edge, but a small metal fold-out would have been nice."
2,Weak design,"Timer works fine but the start/stop button sticks out and when you wear it around your neck, movement can press the button too easily. It is really frustrating to stop the timer by mistake. Food overcooks... DISASTER! Easy solution: manufacturer should RECESS THE BUTTONS!!"
2,Can't hear it,Either I have bad hearing or this so-called timer is not working. I held it right up to my hear when it was going off and did not get the slightest ding. Doesn't work for me.
5,It works great for me.,I think it's a great all purpose kitchen timer. I like that it can hang around my neck and stay with me if I wander into another room. I never miss hearing this timer. It has saved my meal more than once when I got distracted.
4,"Would appreciate an ""off"" switch/button..","The buttons are tiny, but manageable; the numbers are awkwardly placed, but manageable; I (and hubby) like the count-up feature. I am tired of every electronic device IN THE WORLD insisting on serving as a ""clock"" (that, and everything beeps). I have a watch, my microwave has a ""clock"" the oven has a ""clock"" I have clocks in the house, the cell has a ""clock"". - An ""off"" switch or button would be nice so that I could store it without running the battery down. :) I bought it for a timer, not a clock. We store it in a ""snack"" baggie magnet-clipped to the fridge door, with the battery removed. No problems with how it works, just not sure how long it takes for the battery to suck dry..."
5,no burnt cookies,"When baking cookies I'm often doing other things around the house or watching TV. The portable timer gets me back in the kitchen every 9.5 minutes and I don't have to reset for the next tray! Also my husband wears the timer for his grilling. He sets it for the 5 minutes to preheat and then goes off to pull a few weeds or talk with guest, and the timer around his neck calls him back for the next interaction. He enjoys the party and isn't stuck hanging neat the grill or concerned about the outcome and no burnt steaks either!"
4,Excellent timer,"The timer works great, is pretty easy on batteries and reliable. I've had mine for years now and have replaced the battery once. I use it all the time. It would be 5 stars if it were a little bigger and the number buttons were arranged in a keypad type arrangement rather than the goofy 1-5 in the top row and 6-10 in the bottom row (meaning I have to look at the buttons all the time and making it easy to hit the wrong number). But at least it has number buttons at all, which most timers do not."
1,"Loud, small buttons","I know lots of people love this timer. I am the exception. The buttons are tiny and every time a button a pressed, if you are lucky to press the button you meant to press, a loud beeping sound is emitted. In summary, annoyingly small buttons and loud beeping sound."
2,Second one now broken...,"I bought this and had it break on me.Polder was nice enough to replace it.But the new one also broke after light use.It's just not resilient enough. I know it's not supposed to be waterproof, of course, but just the smallest amount of water splashing on it is enough to ruin it. It's a kitchen timer! It needs to have some water resistance.Plus on both of the timers I've had, plus the one a friend owns, the clear plastic covering the LED comes off too easily.Polder, you can do better.If you own this timer and have had yours break, please add a comment."
2,Not So Loud,It counts up. It counts down. What is does not do is make enough noise when it goes off in a loud or busy kitchen. If you are hard of hearing or working in a moderately loud & fast paced kitchen this may not be the timer for you.
2,2 of 4 work,Okay well I hate to give this timer a bad review because I really loved the first one I bought. I ordered 3 more of these for my paraproffesionals and 2/3 of the new times of the exact model stopped working after 2 months. I replaced the batteries figuring that was the issue and they still don't work. I am past the 30 day refund timeline so sadly my classroom budget is down 30 bucks. I'm going to look for another brand of timer as they are very important to keeping my classroom running smoothly.
5,Great Timer - Easy to Set and Use,"I've one of these for 5+ years now and have yet to find a better timer. Setting the time is easy. Being able to just enter the time without using those annoying arrow keys is a joy. Why can't other manufactures use numeric keys? I can't tell you how many times I've missed the correct time using arrows. Here it's Just punch the numbers, hit the start button and you're off.The alarm is loud enough for me to hear to anywhere in my apartment.Five years and I'm only on my second battery.My only complaint (and it's a minor one) is that while the LCD is clear and easy to read it is small so you have to be close up to read it (especially with my rather poor eyesight). I wish someone made a big timer, with a display I could read from across the kitchen) that's this easy to set and use."
5,Can't give this item enough stars!!!,"This has got to be the best timer I have ever owned. It is so easy to use plus I can carry it around in my pocket or around my neck while in use so I don't have to depend on my ""less than good"" hearing. Also has a magnet on the back so it can be stored on my refrigerator. This is not only a timer but it has a clock and a ""count-up"" feature that can all be used simultaneously. I bought my first one about a year ago and love it so much that I bought a second one just recently. There are times when you need to have two timers going at the same time. Can't say enough good things about this little timer. If you are in the market for one, buy this one. You won't be disappointed."
1,Digital read out too small for my need,"I got this timer as I needed it for my exercising and needed to watch the seconds count off. The description said the numbers were large (or something to that effect). However, they are not large enough for me; it seems like the numbers on my cell phone are bigger. This timer is great for use in the kitchen, however. Too bad that is not what i purchased it for."
2,"Works as advertised, poor battery life","Timer works fine but uses an LR44 battery, which is not cheap and does not last long.My fault that I failed to check what kind of battery the device required. Had I known I would have kept looking.The magnet is useless; weak and not centered, so even if it sticks a little, the timer flops.Still, the timer/clock works as advertised, beep is loud enough, and display is readable unless the sunlight is really bright."
4,Great little timer that does a lot of things,"I really like this timer as it has more than one function, and all functions are easy to use and work well. I use it to time my walks, and my cooking. It's small and the batteries seem to last forever. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there needs to be a see through cover over the bottons and time window. Many times I have leaned over and mashed it between an object and my body (the rope is long) and wiped out the total amount of time that was showing. This would not have happened with a cover to protect the bottons from the object. It is very annoying."
5,Love this!,My husband bought me this model as well as the one that looks like a sink top kitchen timer. I thought I would like the other one better since it is basically like the one my Mom and Grandmother had in their kitchens only on a string. It is too bulky and weighs a lot on my neck. I ended up liking this model so much more (they are both Polders). I have not burned anything since owning it. I can set it and wear it to my sewing room and actually eat something for dinner that is not overcooked because I did not hear the timer in the kitchen. I have since bought some for gifts and every one loves it.
3,neat little timer,This is a very neat little timer. I would give it five stars if it just had something to protect the buttons from getting accidentally pressed if you lean against something. It is easy to turn it off unintentionally but you do hear it beep so you can turn it back on. Still worth the price tho'.
4,Too easy to cancel.,"Love the three simultanious functions of this timer, clock and count up instrument. Lavaleir style enhances useablitity. I have a black and a white to wear with different outfits when I go for walks. One annoyance is the set, stop, and cancel buttons can easily be activated. Fortunately there is a warning beep and that gives me an opportunity to reset."
5,T.J.,"This item is incredibly useful. It is a clock, an alarm timer and a count-up timer.I am a hot glass worker and I dare not be even a minute late in turning off a kiln if I do not want a piece of glass art to turn into a puddle. That is what first got me to buy and use this device. But, I find the item works well as an alarm clock - its size lends itself to use as a travel alarm/clock.It is very handy for cooking, setting yard sprinklers, etc. - any activity that requires that you stay on notice. You can set the stove, sprinkler, etc. and then go about your other business in other places with an uncluttered, unworried mind because the timer is small (1""x3/8""x4""), light and has a neck lanyard.The small battery runs for years, literally and drives the solid-state mechanism and an easily-readible digital readout. Comes in black and ivory."
4,Handy Timer,"I purchased this timer for use in the kitchen. It appears to be made well and the beep seems loud enough, especially since you can wear it around your neck. The only thing I would improve is making the numbers bigger on the buttons as my 47 year old eyes have to squint a bit."
2,Has button batteries,"Works fine and like the lanyard, but did not realize it uses button batteries which cost alot and are harder to find. Would not have bought it had I realized this."
1,Save your money,"Bought this to use with the 'flylady' program. I thought it was perfect because it has a lanyard but I was so wrong. The buttons are not covered so if you bump up against something it changes the time or stops it altogether. Plus the batteries are such a pain to buy because they are not standard sized. I would NOT buy again and until they come up with a better design where the buttons are covered, I will not recommend this to anyone."
3,Something wrong . . .,"Got two of these since the ones I had stopped working (didn't realize all I had to do was replace the battery); however, the new ones dont have a ring as loud as the old ones, plus there are times when they don't ring at all. Very unhappy."
3,Good but Count-up Timer doesn't go to 24 hrs.,"The literature says the Count-up timer goes to 24 hrs. but mine only goes to 9 hrs. 59 min. 59 sec.Other than that, I like being able to enter time via 0-9 digits & it's nice & small. It's extremely annoying when it beeps with each key press. It should also stop beeping when you press any key."
1,Bumps,Loud enough to hear... butWay to easy to bump and stop the timer if you wear it around your neck or in your pocket...Would I buy another one... no
2,Disappointing,"Works OK and it's easy to figure out however, the magnet is not strong enough to hold the unit in the position in which it was designed to be read. It will, instead, hang vertically with the numbers pointing in the wrong direction. The beeper is somewhat weak. I would not buy another or recommend it. I'm keeping it because I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it."
4,Good for my purposes.,"I bought this one to replace an old one that broke. So, I am actually reviewing older models of this timer. I like it because a New York City kitchen is too small to have a table. Hence, you cannot sit around the kitchen while the food is cooking. This model timer can be hung around my neck so that I do not lose track of time while I am in another room. Moreover, it beeps continuously for about a minute. These are ts best features. What I don't like about it is that the plastic face comes off too easily. However, in that event, it still continues to work. Moreover, the beep could be louder. But since it is around my neck, I can still hear it. I would not be able to hear it if it were a few feet away.I did buy this one at Amazon, but I have bought other ones from different places."
3,"Works well, but not very ergonomic","Works well, but not very ergonomic. Buttons are kind of small, as is the labeling. If you wear this around your neck, you'd better be nearsighted...."
1,anemic alarm,Nicely made but the alarm is a tiny squeak. If you have any hearing loss in the high frequencies this is almost useless
4,Polder timer,"This is a great timer. The buzzer is long and loud enough. Wearing it around your neck is convenient. My only complaint is that if you accidently bump against something it will stop. However, it does give off 1 beep to let you know."
4,America's Test Kitchen Comes Through,"I watch the show occasionally and this product is repeatedly used and recommended, so I got one. I use both a timer and a tempurature probe to BBQ and this has an accurate timer that is easy to use. But the salient feature is that it can be hung around your neck and stuck in your pocket. The fact that it also has a clock and a stop watch built in just makes it all the more valuable for the money."
5,easy to use,"I really like this item. It's so easy to use. There is bottoms of each number, so it so easy to set the time, just push the number you want, don't need to repeat the same bottom (up or down) like other timers. I always use it for my baking. I like it, eventhough it's a little bit costly. I hope I can use it for long long time."
1,The alarm sound does NOT work,"I originally bought this a couple of months ago for my cooking midterm and final- I needed something with an alarm to alert me to check on different items on the stove. This came after my midterm- and by the time I opened it up for use on my final (last week)- I discovered that the ""alarm"" did not work and it was too late for me to return and exchange at Amazon. It's made in china and I guess I am not surprised with this. At least is was only a nominal price- I would be hesitant to purchase this unless you are prepared to return it. don't bother buying it"
1,Defective on Arrival,Arrived in a sealed package and appeared to be new. None of the functions worked correctly. The clock would not hold the time that I input and neither the timer nor the count up button worked. Returned for refund.
5,Great Timer easy to use,"This is a Great little timer you can use anywhere. You can take it with you Anywhere you go . Just put it around your neck, I use it for training Interval's when I ride my bike it works fine for that . The only thing i wish it had is tenths and hundredths of a second. This thing is not a stop watch its a timer remember that when you buy it."
4,Dandy timer.,"The Polder timer is neat little item, with a lot of versatility.I would prefer it's signal was louder, but I realize with such asmall package that's asking a lot. Use it all the time."
3,Very loud,"I bought this timer based on all the great reviews, however, I need a silent timer and this doesn't seem to come with that feature.Besides that it is a nice little timer. But if you need the silent option you will have to look for something else."
3,Pretty good so far.,"Not a bad little timer. It's loud, but you can always mute it with scotch tape over the beeper in the back. It's a little tricky setting the time, but fine once you get it. The number buttons could be labeled a little clearer. Other suggested improvements would be a stronger magnet on the back, centered in the middle of the timer, and a second timer function."
4,electric timer,"I really like this timer. I work in a research lab and place it around my neck when I have to leave the lab. The only problem I have had is that if you bump it wrong, you CAN turn it off accidentally."
4,Very nice.,"I like the size and shape of this timer. It is easy to use and works well. My only problem with it is the type of battery it uses. It is one of those little round ones and I would have to take the unit to a watch-repair place to get the battery changed, instead of doing it myself with a normal AA or AAA battery. Otherwise, it is a nice timer."
3,Polder timer,"The clock portion doesn't seem to work, but that isn't the feature I bought it for. The timer works. The buttons are small but color coded for the function that you want to use. One really good feature is the neck strap."
5,Incredible spirit music -both ancient and modern,"I have used Brians tapes Power of Seven, Mystic Rain, etc. for several years in a cassette player to calm and soothe fearful dental patients. Often, they will request where to get the tapes. His CD is the best work yet. Anytime one can see him in concert is a blessing. Enjoy, DR. JE Gray"
3,Confused,"I recently checked out of the library what I thought was this book. Especially since it mentions that it is a hardcover book.However, upon opening it to my dismay - it is and it isn't. It has none of the pictures of Daphne and her family, which is why I so wanted the book. The other book under the same name had lengthy text quoted from her books, and a detailed map of Cornwall, and the places she wrote about. Which books were from where. Very informative. I will not return this book. It is nice, it is just not as biographical as the one I got from the library.Vanishing Cornwall (Virago Modern Classics)"
1,EL PEOR CD QUE HE ESCUCHADO,"Nunca espere encontrar un producto de tan pesima calidad en AMAZON. este CD esta probablemente grabado en una grabadora de cassttes viejisima. La voz del que habla es muy tediosa y los efectos sobre la voz son extemadamente amateurs. El sonido de background esta por completo fuera de contexto. Suena como si lo hubiera grabado alguien que no tiene nada que hacer en su casa. Probablemente el mensaje de este CD sea positivo, y la intencion de Carlos Gonzalez sea buena, pero la calidad del audio y la manera de expresarse esta muy por debajo de los standares de un paquete de motivacion que impide poner atencion al mensaje. Tuve que regresarlo. Lo siento. Pero por favor, cuando hagamos las cosas, hagamoslas bien."
4,"Not a bad book, sanely written",It may not be the Sybex book..but it's got nicely set up chapters that someone new to VBA programming can actually read and understand. I found new tricks in the 1st 3 chapters I could employ right away.
3,"Good Info here, but did anyone EDIT this thing?","There is a lot of good information in this book, but as an earlier review said, it is far too rambling and quite frankly poorly edited.Take this example from p. 265:""You can base a recordset on a SQL string only when creating recordsets based on a database object (as opposed to other uses of OpenRecordset, which can be based on tables, queries, or other recordsets). Attempting to do so will get you a run-time error.""OK, hold on here. First, aren't tables and queries database objects? And what's with ""Attempting to do so will get you a run-time error""? They just told us we CAN do this in the previous sentence.I know, I know, if you're familiar enough with the topic you can decipher all this gibberish, but a reader shouldn't have to do that. That why we turn to these books, to make things clearer, not muddier.Much of the book suffers from these spaghetti-like paragraphs and bad editing."
3,yolanda.underwood@cas.honeywell.com,"I found this book to be very helpful in getting over some rough spots. The layout of the book could use some improvement. When referencing a a particular subject the book seems to write a little here and there as apposed to keeping the same topic together. But in spite of this fact, the book is helpful and easy to understand."
1,A serious waste of money and time,A badly organized book that is neither a good learning tool nor a good reference document. I kid you not -- this book was never edited!
3,At least it got me out of trouble once...,Is not the greatest reference book yet but it got me out of trouble in a very difficult situation when i was stuck. Not as good as other Developer's books but you can added to your collection and it won't hurt to have it.
2,Rambling and unorganized.,"This book was not very well written. Examples also didn't work.I would not recommend if you are under the gun on a project and just want a book that shows the quickest way to do something. I wish I read these reviews before I spent 33.00 on it. C'est le vie. Also, the pictures at the end are not very complimentary of the authors. Sorry guys but you look way geeky."
4,A Man's Cookbook,"As my husband loves to hunt wild game, I bought this book for him as a farce. However, it has turned out to be a great purchase. I was at a loss as how to clean and cook wild game until ""Kill It and Grill It"" came along. This is the only cookbook I've bought that my husband hasn't complained about and it's an entertaining and ""colorful"" read as well."
5,"Awesome, intriguing, a whole new way to look at game.","I have buddies on the Chesapeake Bay who hunt and cook wild game. Although I've enjoyed many a dinner at their tables (venison, goose, duck... all served with innumerable oysters), I still didn't know how I truly felt about the issue of hunting for food. The Nugents' book helped me over the hurdle by making a sensible, informed argument for enjoying wild game, and presenting it deliciously. The Coca-Cola Venison Stew is a must-try... tastes far better than it sounds! Great book."
1,There are better books out there...,"A friend got me this book because he knows I think Nugent is very amusing and I like his stance on a lot of issues. This book has good recipes but I was shocked at the tone in which it was written. It comes across as making light of the killing of animals, giving me the impression that the authors have no respect for life. I gave my copy away."
4,Just what I expected -,"This is a gift for my significant other who loves to hunt and likes classic rock, so what could be better? Entertaining to read and the recipies look great - can't wait to try it!"
5,A Must Have for True Game Hunters,"Very well written recipes and the stories are awesome - both Ted and Shemane's. This is a must have for the sportsman who enjoys the ""spoils of his kill"""
5,Ted Nugent's Kill It & Grill It,"Kill It and Grill It: Ted and Shemane Nugent's Guide to Preparing & Cooking Wild Game and FishThis ""creative"" cookbook is a hunter's dream. And the recipes definitely don't all ""taste like chicken"". Get ready for a wild experience--after the kill."
2,kill it & grill it,The kill it & grill it cook book for game is good for a shelf book by a rock star. I felt that some of the game listed was somewhat on the exotic side. I was looking for more of a local northeastern USA taste.
5,Buy It and Try It!,"I bought this based solely on the title and the author. I gave it as a gift without actually reading it. The recipient thought it very funny since we had discussed a ""survival"" camp out earlier."
2,My least favorite FIAR book.,"I was really proud of a young girl for writing such a book. Other than that, though, I didn't enjoy reading it aloud to the kids every day for a week. I just dreaded it. I wish that I had just found it at the library instead of buying it."
3,Don't have kung fu grip,Okay you got the light all set up and it works great but you think a pressure switch would really make it better. This remote switch with curly cord comes with everything to mount it except any form of instructions. Granted it is pretty straight forward and self explantory for the most part but there are at least 3 different ways of mounting the pressure switch which incidently takes a bears grip to function and if your fingers are not in the right place the light will flicker. It works and I'm keeping it but I wish it worked with a softer touch. I was a hard decision whether to keep it or not because it's not cheap in the least but I'm hoping I just get used to it.
1,Wilton Drill Press Vise,"I ordered this 6-pack only to receive just one vise in my shipment. A second order was sent to me and again only one vise. Upon contacting Amazon, my order was cancelled because it was felt the same thing would just keep happening if new oreders were kept being sent to me. My money was refunded and I was allowed to keep the two vises I had already received. All in all though, I would liked to have received all six of the vises that I originally ordered."
3,Business Rules Discussed in Brief,"Overall, the book is very good as it discusses a subject that is not very much covered in the literature. It is good to read to understand some basic concepts about business rules.I have the following comments about the book:1-The analogies to the human body was not very relative and added not much real value.2-The subject of vocabularies and fact models were not easy to understand (for me at least)3-Busines Rules part: I felt that those were the heart of the book and provided good information about the subject.4-Business rules and business process were covered in a high level and felt that more details were needed as business rules represents the core of any processOverall, reading 141 pages (without appendices) made me feel that the real material out of this book could be joined to be 100 pages or less!"
4,great introductory material for consultants and their clients,"Ron Ross was kind enough to send me a copy of his recently publishd 3rd edition of his book, Business Rule Concepts. Ron has been at the forefront of mainstreaming business rule capture for decades. Personally, I am most fond of his leadership in establishing the Object Management Group's Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules standard (OMG's SBVR).This book is an indispensible backgrounder and introduction to the concepts necessary to effectively manage business rules. By no means is this a book about SBVR. Rather, it is about the core and critical concepts necessary to understand how to define a manageable enterprise repository of declarative knowledge covering business."
2,Great subject - Find another book,"For someone who preaches clarity in business rule creation... He should've taken his own advice with regards to this book. Author also mixes in the ""Rule Speak"" concept. It makes a mess of everything."
5,Strategic Advantage,"We have been applying the concepts of a business rules approach for well over five years and consider the principles shared in this book a strategic advantage to us in the market place. This is the must have handbook for those who truly want to bridge the communication gap between customers, business and IT. This should be standard reference book on every business analyst and architects desk. I recommended this book for those who are serious about reducing the cost of IT systems and returning value to the business."
2,Not for the laymen,"This book is maybe good for trained herbalists, but it is nothing for someone who looks for home remedies. The herbs are described in depth and there is a lot on signatures etc. The book doesn't tell you how to use these herbs at least not for those who haven't studied the subject."
5,"Very complete study of the plants, the doctrine of signature","Matthew Wood is recognized world wide as one of the States' most reknown herbalists. His previous book, 7 Herbs: Plants as Healers, was a watershed in teaching herbal healing as a part of toatl wellness. This is continued and enlarged in wonderful detail in this new book .This should be a must read for anyone working in the natural health field or interested in self healing with herbs."
5,Read about Teasel to help Lyme Disease!,"This book really helped my sister with Lyme disease. Matthew writes about Teasel Root which really helps with Lyme. If it weren't for this book, we wouldn't have known about this herb and we wouldn't have asked our local herbalist about it. The other stories he tells are just as interesting. We had our library buy it so everyone can read it."
4,Inspiring!,"This is a truly engaging book, which is not something commonly said about herbals. Matthew devotes much care to each herb he discusses, revealing a great deal of knowledge, experience and insight throughout the book. It is tremendously informative - as such, it's a book that invites study, and certainly frequent reference, for readers who are serious about herbs.As a work by Matthew Wood The Book of Herbal Wisdom deserves more than 5 stars, but as a bound paper book it deserves 2 or 3. Although my copy is relatively new it is already beginning to literally fall apart. True, I do open it frequently, but that is all the more reason the book should be well-bound - ideally in sewn signatures. This book was written to be used. It should also be designed to be used."
2,Cool Game,"Game is pretty cool expecially for the price, only disappointment is that you can't race directly against one another."
3,Fun for little guys,"My six year old gets a kick out of this one. He loves to make the trucks go. It's not as easy as it seems so can be somewhat of a challenge for big people too, but may get monotonous after awhile."

5,It just guide me to ...,"my recovery process. I was facing the affair of my wife, filing for divorce and taking care of my children and this book guide me to a safe place. Through the pages I found what was keeping me in fear and devastation. The most important thing, I found myself, no matter that my wife still wanted to be on the enchanted forest. It show me the way for leaving from a dysfunctional relationship with my wife, but most important from a dysfunctional relationship with myself."
3,"Reader From Reading, PA","The book was not the best I ever read on the subjects but all & all it gave me some good insights on my life and learning a little here and there from any book is good... The book did have some interesting parts in it that I liked and was not bored with it, so I would recommend it."
2,A Tough Game To Control,"While the graphics on this game are first-rate, and the physics of the ball and pins are accurate, there is one glaring omission from the game -- you don't know where the ball is going! The game doesn't show you the effects on your resulting show when you change your mark at the arrows and/or moving your feet on the approach. The result is that too often, what you think is a good strike shot the game thinks is a brilliant cross-lane gutter ball. Give the game a foul and move on to better bowling games that have come out since Ten Pin Alley."
4,"Not even close to the real story, but still a good movie","This is a classic case of Hollywood nearly completely changing a story. The George Tweed and Arturo family saga was interesting enough, wish they'd left it alone.But ... this movie is still enjoyable (most likely even more so if you don't know the true facts). Jeffrey Hunter again shows that he can carry a movie on his own, but Marshall Thompson is outstanding as one of the Navy men trying to stay hidden and alive on such a small island. One good aspect of the movie is that the brutality of the WWII-era Japs is not glossed over, and more importantly, how the Chamaros are truly wonderful and kind people.There are some tense moments in this film, and it does rate a ranking in the good WWII films. But it is VERY disappointing the film was shot in the Phillipines, and not Guam. That simply doesn't make sense. It should have shown it as it was."
5,Great movie but where are the Chamorus?,Great story of the poeple of Guam that help USN George Tweed I just wish they were Guamanians. It would be great if they'd do a remake using Chamorus speaking our language instead of using the Filipino language. I am still glad they made the movie and put it on dvd.
5,No Man Is An Island DVD,"I have searched for the movie,""No Man Is An Island"", for sometime and finally found that it was available through Amazon.Com. Amazon.Com service was wonderful and after placing my order I recieved my copy of the movie in just a few days. Thank you Amazon. The dvd is terrific and excellant quality. I was stationed in the Philipines just after this movie was made and the scenery in this true story really took me back to my Navy days spent there."
2,Extremely hokey and dated,"The Bottom Line:A film which takes an interesting premise (the lead character is the only American soldier left on Japanese-occupied Guam) and runs it straight into the ground within 30 minutes, having apparently decided that World War II should be depicted (poorly--the director doesn't know his way around a camera) as a fun game of cowboys and Indians with cute little Guamese girls, strong-chinned American he-men and no sense of verisimilitude at all; No Man is an Island was such a bad movie that it decreased my desire to watch new films for two solid months.1.5/4"
2,Botched widescreen DVD makes flat VHS version preferable,"A side by side comparison of both the DVD and VHS versions shows the DVD to contain no additional video information at the sides of the frame. That means that the DVD image has been matted to a 1:1:185 ratio that crops important signs, not to mention the breathtaking image of Jeffrey Hunter.MCA-Universal has insisted on transferring every non-Cinemacope/Panavision movie from the 60s to 1:1:185, including the Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedies, which had their precise aspect ratios preserved intact in their laserdisc releases.Audiences havn't been fooled by MCA-Universal's misguided widescreen transfers on DVD. The out-of-print VHS version of No Man is an Island sells for infinitely more than the low-priced DVD.MCA-Universal, get your act together. At least try to achieve the conscientious standard set during the laserdisc period."
4,One of the great movies WWII,One who interest is the WWII especially the Pacific should not miss this movie. Then You will know while the alliance has to stop such a war by the Atomic bomb.
2,No Man Is an Island,Production values and acting more of the level of aB level TV show. Story was good but it was not well presented.
1,Flat out aweful,"Okay, I am so annoyed with this game. This is all I'll say. Okay, bad graphics, bad controls, bad sound, and bad courses and boats make a bad game. Don't waste your money. This one isn't worth anything."
5,Excellent book,Doug and Lincoln's book is outstanding. I had no idea Apache could do so much. The book is also wonderful simply for the perl parts of the examples. The way the code is written is illuminating for many non modperl related programming issues.
5,Want to get the most out of Apache? BUY THIS BOOK!,This is a tech book at its best. Lincoln & Doug have done a great job with module examples to produce a book with quick answers when you're in a jam & indepth coverage when you really need to know the ins and outs of Apache Modules.... It is to Apache Modules what the Bat book is to Sendmail.
3,"Outdated, but still helpful","Helpful for getting your head around the principles of Apache modules, but for modern API reference, see Apache's online docs."
1,This is a bad unit,"We bought this unit about 4 months ago for my mother-in-law. After only a few movies - maybe a total of 10, it repeatedly freezes during playback. Unfortunately, it is 4 months since purchase, so no guarantee (JVC offers only 90 days). I am out the purchase price and will buy another unit - but not on line. Next time I go to my local shop so that I have a place to return it if need be. I should have listened to the negative reviews here as they had the same problems I did."
5,Great dvd player excellent quality best picture,"I bought this unit from vann s electronics, fast shipping and good packaging, but the unit works flawlessly best picture for the price, fast loading easy to use, just one gripe display on front could of been brighter or a little bigger but this unit has excellent features and good sound, and picture quality ive always had good luck with JVC they just seem to keep getting better try this player it will work with any setup from basic to HD< I have one unit and im buying another for my bedroom this unit i would recommend to anyone this unit is well built and i just cannot say enough about this dvd player but I love it try it its well worth your money 5 stars from me"
4,A fascinating history of a unique man and his vision,"Leading by Design has been well researched and covers not just to good times, but also the major challenges faced by Ingvar Kamprad while building IKEA. The interesting conflicts of satisfaction at a job well done and insecurity about choices and the future is a well developed theme. The conclusion I draw is that this is a unique man and his successful company that could only have started in Sweden with it's own interesting social mix."
2,"Nice Store, [bad] Story","Who doesn't like IKEA? Too bad this book isn't as good as the store is. What's wrong? Certainly not the subject of the book, but rather, the writing is repetitive, monotonous, circular, and repetitive...egad...it's contagious!Pass on THIS book and learn about IKEA and its very interesting challenges, history, strategy, and product line (and its founder) from better authors around the Internet."
1,What a disappointment,"As a teapot lover and a devoted tea drinker, I looked forward to having this book to relish on the variety i expected to find in it. I am so sad to say that NONE of is present in the book. Apart from the teapot in the cover, which is very nice, the rest are grottesque figures which do NOT LOOK like teapots at all. they should be published as SCULPTURES, rather.I have 500 plates, 500 vases and 500 bowls,and I am delighted with them. Unfortunately I can not say the same about 500 teapots.As a result, I have become doubtful about getting the other 500s.... left."
5,My Amazon LOVES THIS TOY!!!,"I have 4 African Greys and a Blue Front Amazon, and Ditto, (my amazon) absolutely LOVES this thing!! He plays with it constantly, bypassing other much more expensive toys to play with it instead.My greys aren't as impressed with them, but Ditto adores it. Great toy, for a fantastic price for Amazons, for certain!!"
1,Trash,"Too bad zero stars aren't possible - that's what this deserves. The product received was star shaped vice triangular as shown in the picture. It didn't work. I'm an engineer and I took it apart. Its a poor design - the parts fit tightly together and everything has to fall in place just so for this to work. Some might work, but my guess is that most will not work. Don't waste your money."
3,Okay performances but not worth the marketplace price,"My title pretty much sums up my review. The performances are just okay. The piano concerto is a rarity but the music is not inspired like the great work for violin and orchestra. Even at 2 bucks, this CD is expensive. For the Symphonie, I would search for Perlman or Vengerov."
4,Fits a little small.,I wear a medium glove as a nurse at the hospital. I should have ordered this one in a large. Seems good quality though
5,Cute glove,I bought my mother this glove about two years ago on amazon. I'm not sure why I am only now doing a review. However I am happy to report that she still uses the glove and it's still in good shape. I remember it was on the expensive side but now I understand why. Great quality. My mom golfs every weekend and does tournaments once in a while. So this seems like a good buy for golfing enthusiasts.
3,Good product,Order arrived in a timely manner and in very good condition. I would buy again from this vendor.thank you!
5,Sweet DVD,This DVD is a little insane because it doesn't follow the standard DVD chronology but it's still really cool! Story of the Year is amazing and this DVD exemplifies that x10!
5,A must for any Oracle DBA who cares about the word PERFORMAN,This book offered a complete look at high performance computing for an Oracle7 database. It covers everything about Oracle7 server and hardware tuning. It the best high performance Oracle database book I've ever seen. I've used this book quite frequently when dealing and planning for performance issues. If an Oracle8 version of this book comes out - I will be one of the first to buy it.
4,OLD but GOOD,"Hey they are right; it covers Oracle 7 perfectly but there is Oracle 8 and now Oracle 8i. But for the basics, well this is a great starter. It will explain how to tune Oracle and why; after that get another and explore"
1,the fallen,"this the worst movie I've ever seen, I couldn't even watch it all the way to the end.I took it out of my dvd player and put it away in the garbage can where it belongs.it was a waste of time and money to make such a crappy movie."
4,"Nice bag, but only wished...","This is a great bag, and fits great with my Manfrotto 190XB tripod with 486RC2 ballhead. Great quality heavy material gives protection against scratches and weather.Only 2 things stopped me from giving 5 stars:First, the zippers don't slide easily, so you really have to concentrate when trying to open the bag. But this could be because the bag is brand new, and it may loosen up with more use.Secondly, the bag has a great stiff gray base at one of the ends, with the Manfrotto logo etched into it. However, I realised after that this wasn't the base, but the top opening which can be used to slide the tripod in and out without fully opening the bag. I just thought this would make a great base for when the bag is stored in a standing position.Other than that, can't complain. Don't regret buying the bag, and just like their tripods, it's GREAT quality. Go for it!!!"
4,Great Tripod Bag,Its a rugged bag with great functionality. It does it's job extremely well. Some padding would have been good but then again its a great price so why complain. You can rely on the ballistic nylon for the weight of the tripod as you can bank on the padded head cover to minumise drop impacts. I love this bag. The Manfrotto signage makes it look classy too.
4,Good product ... almost a good value,Got it this morning ... little tight on the fit with my 190CXPRO3 and a 484RC2 Mini Ball Head with RC2 Rapid Connect Plate attached. Quality is good ... price is a bit high. Funny story though ... this little flat package arrived via Prime .. UPS in a huge box nearly 4 foot tall and about 12x12 and stuffed with about a dump truck load of brown wrapping paper. Geesh ...
1,Very bad book,"If you think you know calculus because you understand this book, you are sadly mistaken.There is no rigor, no real problem solving, just paint by numbers. Calculus is pretty much the end of basic mathematics, this book will not get you ready for real mathematical rigor in advanced classes.I guess this book is fine if you aren't a scientist, engineer, computer scientist, economist, or mathematician. Then again, if you aren't any of the above you likely aren't in a calc class. In short, this book is for nobody.The real crime here is that James Stewart is getting rich off this [...], and damaging the future of many students. Overpriced, overhyped, just pure garbage. If this book is required, complain to the math department and then get a real calculus book, and just borrow someone elses copy to get homework assignments. Don't be a sucker."
2,Insufficient examples....,"I bought this book in order to self-teach, and many of the examples were confusing and seem to assume the reader already has a strong background in calculus. I then went ahead and took a calc I class that used Larson's Early Transcendentals, which was much clearer and easier to follow. My calc II class used Stewart's text, but since the homework was uncollected I just skimmed Stewart's text while doing the homework out of Larson's text since it was a better educational tool for me, and I got A's in both calc classes I took.I did, however, go back to Stewart's text and solutions manual to get some additional practice doing proofs. It provided plenty of practice problems, but its explanations were not helpful to me because they tended to skip steps."
2,Bad book,Calculus is not a difficult subject but this book makes it difficult and confusing. I have to consult other resources in order to do well in class:
1,Sent me the wrong edition,The picture is not the same as the actual cover on the book you recieve. I highly regret coming to this buyer but it is too late because my class has already started and I cannot wait for another book to ship.
5,Simply the best,This is the best calculus textbook I have encountered I am a computer science major and I found this book extreemly helpful and gives the right depth. I keep it as a refrence now and always get back to it to refresh my memory. Can't understand how people give a negative review about it
1,calculus,I would gladly give you a review but you clowns have failed to ship the text. I get nothing but the run around concerning this.
2,Not user friendly,"I gave up trying to read the chapters after the first chapter, it was so technical and theoretical it confused me more than anything. Instead, I got the Complete Idiots Guide to Calculus; Dummies Guide wasn't as good for most topics -- but the Dummies Guide has a fantastic workbook, I use that. Also, there's a great Calculus DVD tutorial by Jason Gibson they sell here that's just super, The Calculus 1 & 2 Tutor, I'd highly recommend it. I'm getting a strong B in the class, it's good enough, and I leave the textbook to collect dust until I sell it back."
4,very good calculus book,"This is a good book in general for integration and differentiation basics and vector calculus, but some of the more complicated ideas such as Taylor series and sequences and series could be explained better. In general James Stewart does a great job making Calculus a very approachable subject. I recommend this book."
3,can someone tell me difference?,Please explain Difference between Stewart's and Thomas'I'm trying to buy either one of those two. I borrowed from a city libraryStewart's and I didn't well understand(I know it's my fault) first few chapters that I read.Thomas' is not available in the library and Amazon doesn't offer me to look inside the book.Buying is a quite gamble when I can't test read a few pages.Can someone compare these two books? Stewart's looks way more popular is all I know.Thanks in advance.
2,Bad Book,This is not a very good Calculus book. I used Larson's book for single variable Calculus and it is much better. Since I transferred schools I was stuck with this book for multivariable Calculus and it sucks.
1,Simply Trash,"I do not understand the popularity of this book. It is difficult to follow and the exercises serve to trip you up rather than illustrate the techniques. If you have a weak lecturer, then this book is completely useless."
2,????????,"THIS BOOK READS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY A MATH LAWYER!!!The text is confusing and way too redundant. The sample problems are well-explained,but they're a setup for the homework problems to make you feel stupid.I bought this overpriced book, the solutions manual, and the study guide...I feel screwed.If you are taking a class that requires this book.....DROP IT!!"
1,Book never came,"First of all, I am not one of those people who criticize everything. With that in mind I will only state the truth. The book never came, and it took three, that's three, emails before anyone responded to me. I will say that when I was contacted, they were polite and apologetic, and I was refunded my money."
5,The Only Book on Pancho,"Pancho and my Dad played a lot of pro tennis together. His story here is quite to the mark. The library is complete with Court Hustler, (Riggs) Fred Perry's Book, Bill Tilden's book and a Tennis Memoir by Don Budge"
5,Bill Nye Electrical Current,"I found this video on facebook, but it had been tampered with and I was not able to show it to my students. This video is just what I needed."
2,Messed Up Game Of Golf With A Couple Of Bright Spots,This game has tons of stuff to do on it. But that's about the only good part in this game. The graphics are the worst I've ever seen on a Playstation game and it's plain dull. The other good part or shall I say great part is the camera angles and the camera itself. The camera is just the contrast of the graphics. Overall I would consider this only for people who don't care about graphics but are still seriuos golfers. It really wasn't worth what I got.
2,Taking their time...,"I've been waiting for season 5 for about 6 or 7 months now and no luck so far. I have obtained season 5 by other means and watched about half of it. Sadly, its the worst season of the series. The only original character left is Rembrant and I find myself twiddling my thumbs in the middle of episodes. I have bought all the available seasons this far and will buy season 5 to complete the series in my collection when it becomes available. other then that, believe me, your not missing much. Enjoy seasons 1-4."
4,Review time!,"I really loved this show but some of the changes that occur were too much, even for me. I was able to get used to them but I am still peeved about it. The ending wasn't good either. Left it as a cliffhanger and never continued it on. Still I loved this show despite that.*Estarr*"
3,"Well, I wanted to know how the series ended; not with a bang, but a cliffhanger","Too bad this series didn't go ahead and wrap up the story instead of petering out over a year or two as a series of less and less engaging story lines using fewer and fewer of the original characters. This episode could have been modified so as to give the series a conclusion, but hope springs eternal, I suppose, and it was just another non-ending. My curiosity about the series was satisfied, but not my curiosity about the story, mangled as it was by that time. I am glad that I bought it and watched it, but disappointed in how the series turned out."
1,Give Us 5,"Come on Universal Studios give us Season 5.It's been nearly two years since season 4 was released.If your going to sell a product, sell it all, not just the parts you think you can make a profit on.Personally I liked season 5. Despite no longer having a number of the original main characters.The rating of one is for why it is taking so long to give us the whole series. I would give the season itself around a 3.5 to 4.0 rating. I of course can't comment on the quality of the DVD since we don't have one yet, still."
5,An dear old friend,"I bought this book for my two daughters when they were three and six, and it is like a dear friend to us now. The CD that accompanies the book is so soothing and familiar to us, and the music and songs are perfect for bedtime. The neatest thing about the CD is that it begins with the vocalist reading and then singing the text of the book, but after several tracks, the music changes into instrumental, somewhat mystical selections that even I have found very soothing and enjoyable. My daughters are six and nine now, and they both still love ""Lullabies Under the Moon."" I can't imagine being without it."
3,A cute little book.,"I just wanted to put in my two cents because I politely disagree with the only review that is posted about this book. I was having great difficulty getting my three-year-old to settle down at nighttime until I discovered this. Maybe it was just the novelty of listening to a CD at night, but he really loves it. Now our routine is to listen to the first four or five songs together before he goes to bed. The cadence and rhythm of the spoken words/narration is very soothing. In between the narration, the songs are very simple and quiet. I agree the accent is a little strong, but Jack seems to love it. He wants to hear it again and again. Sometimes we look at the book together, but more often we just listen to the CD. After the first few songs and pages of the book are read, the rest of the CD is instrumental soothing music. I wouldn't say it's a fabulous book, but it works for us. From a little boy who wouldn't go to sleep, he's just like the little bunny in the story."
2,"great book, so-so music","this is a lovely little book. the illustrations are charming and the look and feel of the book is very pleasing. i was hoping the cd would match the quality of the book. there are a few nice tunes, but generally, the songs are pretty treacly. it would have been nicer had there just been a retelling of the little story and some instrumental lullaby music. it's still worth buying for the book, and i like the idea of combining a lullaby book and CD, but i would buy another CD of lovely music for kids and substitute it before giving this as a gift. (it's a good buy so it wouldn't be prohibitive to do this.)"
5,Extremely Powerful and Insightful,"This is one of 3 books that every one of my clients get from me. This is basically the system for recruiting and building your dream team. It's one of the most powerful books in Brad's collection and I highly advise any business owner, manager, or supervisor to have a copy and use it as a guide for building and working with their team."
2,Misleading Title,"There is nothing ""instant"" about what this book recommends. It is essentially a compilation of management basics, that, if implemented, will result in having better employees. There were no fresh ideas."
3,Read any of Brad Sugars instead of RICH DAD AND YOU,"will learn something. This is the best in the series, but there is knownledge in all of them. ..... ........... ........ ........... ............ ...."
2,Don't buy this puzzle!,"This puzzle is really hard to do, because it is a ""photomosaic"" which means that every piece is a scene from a Simpsons episode. It wouldn't be so bad, if the pieces were larger. But you can barely see the little scenes and match them up. I recommend having a magnifying glass handy. Also, a lot of the scenes are the same! So you can't just go by the scenes, you also have to go by shape. And the shapes are not that varied either, let me tell you. All these things combined make the puzzle almost impossible to finish. And it sucks all the joy out of doing a puzzle. Mine has been sitting on the table for nearly 3 months. I wish I could get my money back. :("
4,"nice, simple phone","I have a cell phone only because I've been stranded in a dead car on the side of the road too many times. I just want a phone that will let me call the emergency services if I need them, or to let my family know I'm not dead, just stranded. :) I really like this little phone because it's small and fits in the ""watch"" pocket of my jeans. It has a few more features than I will ever use, for example... why would I web surf on a tiny screen when I have a computer with a 19"" flat screen at home? I do like the text messaging, and the calculator. The voice transmission is clear and easy to hear, even for someone with some hearing loss like myself. I found the menus easy to use, if not always intuitive.Bottom line - if you want an easy to use cell phone without all the fancy bells and whistles, this is a good one."
1,cheap,This phone feels & looks cheap. I have not found this phone to user friendly either. It was not worth the amount of money I paid for it.
1,Very Dissatified,Bought this to replace an older DVD writer. Easy setup and worked fine for about 3 days. Then problems started. First there were numerous write errors. Then the write speed declined from 4x to 1x or slower. It took 82 minutes to write a 2 GB folder. Then while writing another file it died altogether. No lights were on and it would not open leaving the disk inside. I won't buy a Pacific Digital product again.
3,decent,"ok for the price. Plastic slide and nail reciever is kind-of cheap and may break if dropped. Safety is annoying, so I wedge it back with a shim. Install 35 sticks of base moulding, gun worked well, only had to recess 5 nail heads."
2,Let Down,"Researched a lot of Brad Nailers and found this one that offered the most features with the best price. Brought it to the job and half way through the first rack of nails the nails jambed in the rack. The nail rack seperated into 2 and overlapped each other preventing any advance to the driver. After an hour, finally got it unjambed and nailing again.. Nail racks must stay in one piece (no using left overs up, and be gentle not to bump the gun). I'll pay the difference next time."
3,good price for the brand,"So far no problems, but I don't use this gun everyday, all the plastic parts worry me, I am so afraid to drop the gun on the floor. It drives nails through hard wood with out problemsThe shipping was slooooooow"
2,"Bad magazine on all of these, beware!","I've been a trim carpenter for 33 years and have had many GREAT Hitachi saws and guns, THIS nail gun would be good if the magazine worked properly. I have seen many of these nailguns on jobsites and they all have the same problem that can't be fixed for long! The nails that are loaded into the gun WILL get jambed and you will eventually break the gun trying to free the slide mechanism. It can't be fixed in a way that will last any reasonable amount of time...I will NOT buy another! Everyone I know that have owned one will never buy another...it's a LEMON. Check with your local tool repair shop and ask them if this is true. I bought the more expensive of the two Senco nailers and have had NO trouble."
3,Great nailer but. . . .,"I love using this nailer, but I cannot load more than one section of nails at a time. If I do, the spring pushing mechanism jams by sliding up over the nails. Beats me as to why. It is heck to break it loose too."
5,Hitachi NT50AE2 18-Gauge Nailer,"Purchased recently to do trim work around the home. Very easy to set depth for nailing. Fired into oak and pine. Excellent performance to date - no misfires, no marring of wood, depth of nail remains constant regardless of material, bright color of signal and location make it easy to tell when last few nails are left in nailer magazine. Its light weight and center of balance make it a breeze to use in any location and with either hand. Although it needs a few drops of pneumatic oil to maintain its performance, it is no big deal if you have a relatively steady hand. The tool case definitely needs more room to store safety glasses, nails, oil, etc.. Overall, a great purchase for my needs."
2,"Poor Fit, Construction","This nailer seemed to work fine the first day, but quickly began to show flaws. The slide that presses against the nails began to slip and jam inside the nail trough. Yesterday, on about the 50th clip of nails, it all sprung apart. After 15 minutes with my crew not working, we located the pieces and very carefully put it back together, but within 10 minutes it blew apart again. The first clip of nails this morning and it happened yet again.Based on the good reviews it may be that this was just a faulty piece of equipment, but once bitten, twice shy, as the saying goes. I'm switching brands for my replacement. Amazon, as always, quickly agreed to accept the return."
1,Contractor put 3 of these in the field... all broke quickly... How do I mark Zero Stars!,"We are a residential general remodeling company and I would say that we are quite nice to tools compared to many companies. We have lived and breathed Hitachi framing nailers and 15ga finish nailers. We even have an older 18ga nailer that is still in service. I sided with this gun do to the rep and price and what I got were three guns in my scrap pile.They tried to save money and weight by going to the plastic magazine, which is pretty common among gun manufactures, but they went cheap and the tolerances seem off so the nails jamb in the cassette. The cassettes and springs have literally exploded on two guns and the last one to still be working is misfiring something fierce. I can't chock any of these problems up to user error. The gun just isn't quality.Sorry Hitachi but I am going to a different brand.Rob"
4,great nailer for the price,"Not a Cadillac, but you are not paying for one either. A great daily use nailer at a great value."
1,"Jams immediately on 2"", eventually on shorter brads.","Just like the other 1 star reviews I had endless jams with 2"" brads and too many with 1.5"" and 3/4"" brads. The magazine is simply too sloppy and the spring-loaded plate finally completely wedged after two-weeks of use and less than 200 brads. It's not worth trying to fix. It's also hard to use if you don't have the nailer square to the surface.The only positive is it was sufficiently inexspensive that I'll just toss it.If I could give this zero stars I would."
2,Not So Good,"1).Because of the safty position You have to hold nailer sideways or upside down to tack casing on top of a door or window.2).Started to mishit nails from day 1. (1 out of 10-15 nails would need a nailset.)It sits on a shelf unused. (used less than a week)2 stars because it was cheap,light,and looked good.May work for light duty home use, but don't buy if You plan to use it daily."
5,VERY Pleased,"The site was very user friendly, I received my new nail gun on time...and the price was more than fair...45% below retail store price at Lowe's.Will recommend and use again when the need arises!-Darell K-"
1,no good,"I had this gun a month now. The nails are getting stuck behind the magazine advance, so the nails don't advance I have to open it up and unstick the nails. maybe I just go a bad one, but don't like its design. I am going back to porter cable."
1,Comes Broken,I bought this nailer and it came broken. Depth adjuster knob won't turn. I have to travel 1 hour to get it repaired which will probably take 2 weeks.
2,hitachi- nt50ae2 18-gauge,Need to redesign the black nylon it's too slippery when try to aimed at 45 degree angle. Need to have silicon type so a lot better for aiming at angle.
2,SLIDE JAMS THE NAILS 90% OF THE TIME!!! SHOULD HAVE RETURNED A LONG TIME AGO!!!,THE SLIDE IS VERY LOOSE IN PRODUCT AND ALLOWS NAILS TO JAM UNDER SLIDE AND CAUSE A BIG NIGHTMARE WHEN TRYING TO COMPLETE PROJECT!!! YOU HAVE TO UN-JAM NAILS AND REMOVE SLIDE AND ALIGN THE SLIDE BACK AND START ALL OVER AGAIN!!! WHAT A POOR PRODUCT!!!
2,hitachi not what they use to be..,"BOught this gun last year when my trusty old senco got stolen. figured it was hitachi and would be a good gun. within the first month it was jamming, then a few months back the magazine jammed up and wouldnt close, minus me beating the thing in. took it in to have the warranty up held and hitachi made a big stink about it with me. took 5 weeks for the tool shop to get the part, could have been the tool place for fairness. i do know i was on the phone multiple times with hitachi and when the ""manager"" said he would take care of it and days kept going by minus a phone call, which he said he was going to make, i got bummed. it got fixed, but this will be the last time i ever buy a hitachi tool."
3,"Nice, but 2"" is 2 much","I've only used it once and this is the first air nailer I've ever owned so factor that in. My gf is an artist and asked me to construct ""canvases"" made of pine 1"" x 2"" frame with 1/4"" luaun on top. The canvases are 4' x 7'. The nailer worked great, driving the brads flush to the surface without making undue indentations. My only gripe is that about 5% of the brads I inserted, bent as they were being driven and curled out of the 1"" x 2""s at odd angles. I was somewhat surprised as pine is so soft. I suspect that either these brads hit hard knots or 2"" brads are just too long. In any case, I might just end up getting a finish nailer.Also, it should include the oil...?"
3,HAVEN'T USED,Haven't tried out the Hitachi yet. Great price for a decent brand is what attracted me. Hope it's close to the Porter-Cable guns I own in performance.
4,nice nailer,"nailer is light, a little louder than my last nailer,i like the fact that it shoots 2 brads,depth adjustment is nice will set the 2 brad in oak.will spark when it shoot the brad but getting less,I've only put about 150 brads in it. I'm sure once it get broke in the sparking will go away.Hitachi makes real good product ,i have many other tools from Hitachi,the only think that would be nice is a place to hold brads in case,"
2,second stand by tool,I purchased this product because of my Hitachi history with their other tools. Some are favorites. My Porter Cable nailer went on me after 10 years. and i needed another that day. I went to Amazon and was going to order the same nailer but i opted for this hitachi because of the best buy rating. i received it the next day and used it for about a half day when it jammed and did not make it back. i don't think this tool can be a dependable one for a professional. Probably a good stand by.
3,"Good, but you can't load a full set of nails","I like this gun, but there are two things that are a drawback.1. Don't try to load a full amount of nails. Only load 1/2 the cartridge. The spring seems to get stuck under a lot of pressure.2. The nib that gets pressed back when you place the gun against a piece of wood to start nailing hits the wood very hard and on any kind of softwood, it leaves a little mark under the nail hole. Just something else to apply caulking to later, if you're using this nailer on a softwood.Overall a decent product, just keep in mind the above points."
3,jamming of slide mechanism,I bought two in the space of six months the nails that are loaded into the gun jam and now i have two guns with broken slide mechanism
5,I love this Brad Nailer!,I have a strong background in woodworking. I build lots of our own furniture and many other things around the house. I use this brad nailer to hold together my work as the glue dries. The 18ga nails have enough holding power on their own for many things but I would recommend using glue for sure. I have never had a nail jam after firing over 2000+ nails I have to say this is an awesome little nailer.
5,Just what I was looking for,"As a homeowner and not a contractor, I can not comment on the durabiliy of this nailer, or how many mis-fires I had every thousand nails. I had some finish work I was doing when I ordered this item and it worked flawless. It is light and good quality, I was nailing 2"" brads into Oak and it was excellent. For the do it yourselfer, this is a great product at a reasonable price."
1,What a piece of junk!,I've used Hitachi's framing nailer and 15ga finish nailer for years and would rater those as excellent. This 18 gauge nailer is just junk. The magazine doesn't hold the nails in place so they migrate around and even overlap the pressure plate. The nail strips break apart and then jam constantly. I've used various other inexpensive 18 gauge nailers and have never encountered one so unreliable. This one is going back to Amazon.
5,"Light, Powerful, excellent tool","An excellent tool. It is light and still powerful. Capable of shooting a range of nails with power left over. At first I was concerned about the quality at this price. Do not be concerned, the build quality is excellent. It can hold it's own or better to any of the major brands. A important factor for me was that the safety release is behind, not in front, allowing a clear view of nail position."
5,Awesome nailer!,"This is everything I've ever hoped for in the ultimate brad nailer! Flawless function, intuitive and very comfortable. I can tell that, barring someone stealing it, I'll probably never need to purchase another brad nailer again.Editing to add: I've used the nailer pretty hard over the last few days of hanging case around my windows and am loving it. It hasn't had one jam in probably a thousand firings. Someone mentioned having trouble with 2"" brads....that's all I've been using and have had zero problems."
5,Brad nailer,"The other 5 star reviews are right. Works flawlessly, lightweight. Although other brands of brads will fit, I found a good variety of Hitachi brads at Lowes"
4,"Great unit, especially for the price","Over the past couple of years had a Dewalt and a Bostich brad nailer fail me, and with the price of repairs, a new one seemed to be a better option. Bought the Hitachi for several reasons - positive reviews and price. Cannot say I'm even slightly disappointed with the purchase. Arrived within two days and so far has worked flawlessly. The unit is much lighter than the other two I had used, which is a positive when working overhead on crown, etc. The ONLY thing I wish it had was a belt hook as the Bostich did. That would make it perfect."
5,Hitachi Brad Nailer.,"I purchased this [used] brad nailer for my husband and he loves it. He's been replacing all of the door jambs, casings, baseboards, and crown in the house. His old brad nailer was terrible and he ended up having to hammer nails in, which is a very slow process. This brad nailer has been used to fully trim five rooms so far and has helped my husband finish these rooms much faster than with the old brad nailer or his hammer."
2,Hitachi nt50 Jams with longer nails,"I bought this nailgun almost two months ago, and just used it for the first time. It seems to work just fine, and though right out of the box i was concerned about the durability of the plastic parts (the nail storage area in the gun is made of plastic, and it has a bit of flex in it, and I wonder if it could withstand a dropping like the old senco i used to use can).So the durability was the issue right out of the box. But the real actual problem is that when I used 2"" nails designed for the gun, they jammed the gun twice in less than a half hour of use. Just to add, I read thoroughly the instructions.Not so happy with this nailgun."
1,Jams constantly,"Extremely disappointing. Bought this based on the positive reviews, but it jams constantly on 1 5/8"" Bostitch brads! I unfortunately didn't get the opportunity to use the nailer before the Amazon return policy lapsed, so now I have to get warranty repair on a brand new, defective tool. Never buying Hitachi again."
2,"Excited, then disappointed","Thought I had gotten a deal, but upon using the nailer, it jammed right away and continued to do so. I did like how the safety was behind the nailer, but the plastic rack must not have had the tolerances for the nails. Last jam, the nail went behind the movable rack and was impossible to get out. Eventually, trying take the rack of ended up breaking a plastic piece, rendering the gun inoperable. Too bad."
5,Pleasure to use,"Redoing my kitchen and needed something better than a hammer for the trimwork. Decided to purchase a pneumatic nail gun for the project. After reading numerous reviews, I decided to purchase this Hitachi...what a pleasant surprise! Not only was it a great price but what a great tool. Attached to my 4 gallon compressor, this very lightweight gun has the ability to handle various lengths of nails, makes this a must for anyone doing trimwork, building furniture, etc. Before you do anything, make sure to try the gun on a crap piece of wood, allowing to give you the feel for how it fires, etc... The only thing wrong with this package is that it did not come w/ a small vile of lubricating oil. I ended up making a run to the big box store to purchase some oil which is crucial to its long life."
2,Horrible build quality,"I bought this based on the positive reviews and affordable price. In this case should have taken advice of the negative comments. I probably used this nailer less that 5 hrs and things started breaking apart. The loader just come off the slot, with the spring and all the plastic pieces in there.Good while it lasted - fired properly - no issues there."
1,"Doesn't work with 2"" brad nails","I should have read the one-star reviews before purchasing. Nailer jammed every time I have tried to use 2"" brads. There is obviously a problem with this product. I sent it back and will buy another brand."
1,"i am a professional trim carpenter , this nail gun is garbage","I strongly recommend that you do not buy this nail gun. It is garbage, as a professional woodworker, and trim carpenter, i have owned this gun and after less then two months of use, the magazine in which the nails are held and fed cracked , and does not feed the nails right. Id like to say that it was maybe a fluke nail gun however i bought two guns at the time, and they both did the same thing, on the second gun the spring in the magazine, which is suppose to feed the nails, it blew up shooting that parts everywhere, , save your money and find a better nail gun because this one is crap"
1,I couldn't get it to work with 2 inch nails,"This gun worked fine until I switched to 2 inch nails. The nails slid under the slide in the magazine. The resulting jamb kept the gun from firing as the nails would not advance. Pulling the nail jamb out resulted in the spring and a plastic piece that held it, falling out. I had the gun repaired and it did it again with the 1st set of two inch nails. I'm using a rigid 18-gauge nailer and am very happy."
2,ok,"The gun was in good condition, but the details of the product never told me that I would need a air pressure tank. This may seem like a no brainer to some people, but not all. So I had to return it."
4,The Ultimate summary of Packet Communications,This book is a great introduction into what will be the wireless data communication protocol of the future - GPRS. I recommend any one working in the field or looking at starting out grab a copy of this book for reference now and in the future. I just started working in the field myself and found it a great start to the complications of protocols.
