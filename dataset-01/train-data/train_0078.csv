1,Slow Reading,"The book is too ""wordy"" Names and items are repeated too often. ie. ""tiny white van"". The characters are not believable."
3,Nice Try,"This is a book so simple written it hurts itself. It keeps flowing in one simple direction and never turns back. I thought of it to be a good one but when I started reading this I noticed that the landscape was more important than the works Mma Ramotswe is dealing with, so I am giving this book this rating"
2,Definitely a Weekend Read,"The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency was a classic weekend read. Both the prose and the plot are quite simple. The several cases she solves are also simple and very predictable. This is the kind of book you take to the beach and finish it in no time. This is definitely not the kind of book you ponder and re-read. The good things about this book are the characters and the exotic setting of Botswana. It made me aware of how little I know about Africa and made me want to educate myself about Africa. The main character, Precious Ramotswe is pleasant and resourceful (large and warm like Africa). The other characters are also straightforward and somewhat memorable. However, I struggle the fact that this book is on the New York Times Best Seller list. I recommend Helen Fielding's (Yes, the author of Bridget Jones' Diary)Cause Celeb."
5,Charming,"A deightful easy read that will chase away all your troubles. I'm now a great fan of the # 1 Ladies Detective Agency and have read all three books in the series. I hope that there will be many more wonderful adventures with Mma. Ramotswe----soon, now that I'm hooked!"
2,Pleasant But Tediously Thin,"This book received two Booker Judges' Special Recommendations in 1999 and was voted one of the International Books of the Year and the Milennium by the Times Literary Supplement, which can either be explained by British sentimentality or British condescension, but not by any special literary qualities. If you're looking for the Botswana version of Miss Read, this is your book. This isn't Inspector Morse transposed to Africa but tales of English village life, and the result is, to say the least, disorienting. Furthermore, the ""cases"" that Mma Ramotswe, No. 1 Ladies' Detective, investigates make the Hardy Boys look like Sam Spade. Mma Ramotswe drinks bush tea, not Twinings, but reading this book is like slowly drowning in a weak brew with far too much milk and sugar."
2,A Mess,"With all the hype surrounding this book, I expected to love it. I didn't. The story begins with a slow narrative about Africa, which is where Mma Ramotswa, the main character lives. We then get a very short anecdote about a case Ramotsaw handles through her detective agency. From there, we get many pages of background information from her father's life, in her father's voice - and her father is already dead. By the time the story got back around to the detective agency, I had forgotten the book was supposed to be about a a female detective. I found the book slow and lacking in focus. Honestly, 2 stars is being generous for me."
3,Whats the hoopla about?,Interesting book with nice written style by the author. The language and style ring true and the Stories are interesting snapshots of life in africa but I really couldnt figure out what the big noise is all about? maybe I need to go to the today website (this was their selection for book of the month) and see what other people thought. I think V.S Naipal or Chinua Achebe are better options if you want to learn a little about africa. This is a sweet gentle book and i agree with other reviewers about it but this is no earthshaking examination of africa.
4,Entertaining,"Just what I was looking for - intelligent, but entertaining. Memorable characters. I will look for more books in this series."
4,no. one ladies book,The book was for my son's school reading assignment. The book arrived on time and he was able to do the work he needed. I was pleased with the fact that after looking all over the place I was able to get the book from you in a matter of days.
3,Decent read but definitely not outstanding,"This book was simple and uncomplicated and showed earthy wisdom and a great love of Africa and its people. But I obviously didn't find it as fascinating as others. While I read the book in short order, I certainly wouldn't call it a page turner. There was no real suspense to hold my interest. While it was a decent read, it definitely will not be the most memorable book I've come across. Use it for change of pace reading."
4,Unexpected and Enjoyable,"After hearing rave reviews from friends and acquaintances about this series, I bought the paperback of the first book. I thought the series would be like Murder, She Wrote in Africa. Boy, was I wrong. This book has a charm that is all its own. Instead of having the entire story revolve around one mystery or plot, it has vignettes of mystery and intrigue. Much of the beginning of the novel is narrative background material. At first, this confused and bored me, but then I embraced the meandering story and realized that this is not an intense series about mysteries being solved, but instead a series about a strong woman who interacts with her community and solves mysteries. Once I realized the difference, I enjoyed the rest of the book completely.The cover has a matte texture, but doesn't pick up dirt as easily as I'd expect. This is good since I like paperbacks for dropping in my purse for reading on a train ride or unexpected wait."
4,Precious is precious,"The simple rythym of this gentle story transported me back to the arms of southern Africa, whose embrace I am still firmly locked in despite having left for foreign shores over a decade ago. The idiosyncrasies of life for Precious Ramotswe had a smile on my face that lasted the entire duration of the book. It is an easy, although possibly hauntingly nostalgic read, and revealed enormous wit and talent on behalf on a very astute yet unassuming author."
5,Works for me,My mother in law turned me on to these books. I read the first one in a day and went to the library for the rest. I am dying to know what Bush Tea is like. I loved the simplicity and honesty of Botswana. I'd love this whole series to be on PBS or a movie. And the main character had better be a 'traditionally built' Botswanan woman! It's fun and entertaining to read. I love these characters.
5,The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,"Such a pleasant read! The difficulty lies in pronunciation of the South African names. There is no pronunciation guide - that would help a lot! Nevertheless, I look forward to reading more books by Alexander McCall Smith."
4,Great little story for a quick read,"An endearing story. The protagonist, Precious Ramotswe, is the owner of the only Ladies' Detective Agency in all of Botswana. While she tries her best to deliver exemplary service, she sometimes falls a little short of the mark. Her sometimes bumbling investigatory tactics, however, make her one of the most affable characters I've met in quite some time. Her cases are varied and her ""hunches"" lead her to solve several cases - like the woman whose husband went missing. On a hunch, Mma Ramotswe decides to wrestle and kill an alligator to determine if the contents of its stomach includes any belongings from the missing man. Incredible technique, but it worked for her!This story was a quick read and has prompted me to read more in Alexander McCall Smith's series. I would recommend the book for light reading that is different, creative and quite entertaining."
3,"Great book, but where's the plot?","This book shows the mysteries of Mma Ramotske, an African detective. She solves case after case of fellow villagers. These cases involve a man who's accused of stealing a car, a daughter who might be involved in a relationship, and a mysterious disappearance of an 11-year old boy.Although the story was enjoyable, I thought it was very low on plotline. It just switches from case to case. The book might have been better if each case was a short story and had its own chapter.Otherwise, if you enjoy reading mysteries, you may like this book."
2,Didn't live up to all the hype,"I read this book with eager anticipation. It had been of the best seller list with great reviews. I was dissappointed, the story was slow and the plot simple."
3,Sherlock on the Kalahari,"This is a very pleasant collection of detective stories, each with a twist at the end which is what you would expect of the genre.It is also an introduction to Botswana and some of its people which is both interesting and entertaining. The protagonist is likeable, the characters are well portrayed and the environment is well described.It may indeed be the first of an ""Internationally Best-Selling Series"" but it is not a powerful work; merely a nice one."
5,Enjoy them with Roibos tea!,"I tired of gory, death-on-the-doorstep-everyday mysteries years ago, so was very happy to find this lovely series. Gently and mindfully written, the stories are funny and endearing, the mysteries gripping. Different, refreshing, and a nice view of another way of life. I've also listened to this book on tape and it's read by just the right person!To enjoy them even more, order some roibos (redbush tea:fruity, non-caffeinated and healthy) to drink while you read them, and share both with friends!"
2,Had potential,"In consideration of the book's title I must admit that I was somewhat suprised and excited when reading the first few chapters because there was a glimpse of the culture of Mme Ramotswe's Africa. We learned about customs and acceptable and unacceptable social practices and those items that are ""taboo."" Unfortunately, as the author continues with Mme Ramotswe's journey as a detective I found that the author could have indulged us more with an exploration into the ""whys"" rather than teasing us with shallow information."
5,A charming book - series of mysteries,"This is the first of a series set in Botswana (located immediately north of South Africa) telling the stories of a woman who sets up a detective agency with the money she has inherited from her father. The charm comes from the stories of life in Botswana, about the culture there, and the differences between Botswana's traditional culture and Western values.The stories are loosely connected, but each chapter could without much rewriting stand alone as a short story. Each is a little pearl, with an African Miss Marple using her cleverness to solve mysteries.I've read a later book in the series and thought this one was quite a bit better, although I enjoyed the later one also. I intend to read more in the series."
4,Thoroughly original and enjoyable,"This is one of the most original novels I've read in a long time. Prepare to settle in for more than your share of ""bush tea"" and follow the rambling narrative to its satisfying end. All of the details in this novel are delightful, and no detail is over-described. There is a lot of room for your own imagination in this book!"
4,No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,"Very entertaining and somewhat educational. Good light reading. You will learn about life in Africa and the problems, some humorous, some not, of the ordinary people."
3,Quaint,"This title manages to give you a taste of the local culture while at the same time breaking gender barriers.This is not they typical in your face who done it. The main character, who is a mystery herself, reveals her story in mini escapades. As each case is brought to fore there is plenty of time to contemplate how it should be solved, and to envision the family dynamics or circumstances of the clients.In a word this book is *** Quaint *** and gives you more then meets the eye."
4,"Optimistic, fun book","Characters in this book are defined by their actions, not what they look like. Enjoyable journey as the main character outwits and puzzles out situations for her clients."
5,"Entertaining, Enchanting and Satisfying!","Satisfaction Guaranteed for All Parties"" reads the sign on The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and so should the cover of the book! Following the adventures of lady detective Ramotswe was a delight. The short adventures, insights to human nature, and the matter-of-fact approach to her work will charm any reader. Smith captures and conveys some of the subtle African nuances of life in this book. You will definitely like this entertaining work whether or not you like mysteries."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I enjoyed The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, although I don't feel it lived up to its mystery label. I felt this more to be a fiction story about Africa, with simple mysteries a way of moving plot forward and allowing back story highlighting African history and culture. Still, Precious Ramotswe is a likable character, and fans of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple are likely the readers who drove this book to the top of the National Bestseller lists."
4,The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (Book 1),"Our book club read and all enjoyed. A quick read, and very entertaining. We all are planning on reading more by the author."
5,BETTER THAN 5 STARS!,"Hysterical, heartwarming book. It made me feel good when I was sick. Get it now! Book in excellent condition."
2,Obviously in the minority here...,"I have read the overwhelmingly glowing critiques of this book and wonder if I read the same book. I thought this was an uneven, predictable novel that made me wonder what could have been done with such rich material and such potentially interesting characters in the hands of a better author. I am certain this will show up as some equally inept made for tv movie. The bestseller list is not usually a barometer of good literature, and this book proves it to me once again."
3,"Interestng, but short of engaging.","This novel--to the extent that it is a novel rather than a collection of short stories--certainly is different, due almost entirely to the detective/mystery genre in its third world setting. The change is refreshing, offering mild intellectual stimulation to the reader through an introduction to Botswana's language, culture, geography, and wildlife. These are introduced in such a way as to be memorable, so it's a more pleasant way to develop an interest in the landlocked country than reading an encyclopedia entry.However, I found the novel disappointing. For each little challenge that came to the Lady Detective, Mma Romatsuwe, none was much more than a question-and-answer for her. She only had to think up a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, I realized the solution to her most difficult challenge as soon as I saw the problem.I do not feel inspired to read any further in the series."
2,Not All It Was Cracked Up To Be...,"This novel came highly recommended to me by a friend whose book judgement I trust, but I was halfway into it when I realized, ""My god. This is African Encyclopedia Brown!""I like the way the author describes Africa, and it did have a sense of place, but it seemed like such a gossamer thin plotline throughout. Silly even. I always knew what would happen next.Liking a book is a very personal experience, but for me, ""Poisonwood Bible,"" was a more substantive, enjoyable and dimensionalized view of Africa."
2,I tried to love it,"I give the author points for character development - the heroine is so human with all the good and bad that goes along with that but the plot is painfully slow! Precious is clearly a 3 dimensional character as are the people she meets throughout her journey but I found myself thinking ""do something - anything to move this story forward!"" In all, the book failed to hold my attention and I found it rather boring."
2,The No. 1 Mystery Writer Wannabe,"The author in his time has written several children's books, and, well, actually this is a children's book as well. It reminds me most of any Disney story where Mickey Mouse and Goofy set out to catch a mastermind of some kind.On average, you'll have figured out the whole mystery about five pages before the heroine, Mma Ramotswe, has. Unless you're a seven year old, that is. Then you'll probably just about be solving mysteries alongside the lady detective.Unless you're annoyed by details like every second paragraph beginning with ""She"", you'll find this book an easy read. And there's no doubt the author knows Botswana/Southern African life and everyday language very well, and he demonstrates it through his writing. If you're a sucker for anything African, including the occasional crocodile and snake thrown into the story for no major reason at all, you'll like this book. If you're a grown-up and looking for something Agatha Christie-like, you will not."
2,A junior's book selection,"This ""mystery"" was placed in with the adult literature at the bookstore. It really is geared to about 5th or 6th grade with the exception of some discussion of almost explicit sex. I'm not sure of the author's intent, but the story and the writing was not of the complexity for an adult. I might rate it higher if thought intention was to gear for children, with a warning about the sex inferences.The story is set in Botswana. A middle-aged woman starts a detective agency and investigates the regular cases that a detective agency would investigate. No complex crimes, etc. The woman is pretty simple and leads pretty simple life. She solves the cases by using common sense, kind of like you would expect in Tom Sawyer or from Dear Abby."
2,Ashley & Mary Kate all grown up in Botswana,"If this was listed as ""junior reading"" and eliminated the minor sex references, I'd probably give this book a couple of more stars. The cases do not have much complexity and the stories are not rich in Africa life."
1,Main Character,"Main character achieves all her good results from lying, hates dogs, uses one as crocodile bait, has super human intellectual powers and extreme pride in her abilities. Not my type of heroine."
1,no way,"I finished this book in July for my summer reading. I'm a sophmore in high school. I was THOROUGHLY disappointed. There was not one ounce of humor (although the cover claimed so) and the stories were mishappenly thrown together. There was no central plot. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone, old or young."
1,The No1 ladies detectiv e agency,"One of the most boring books i've ever read, if not the most b oring.My own fault, I fell for an article written about the author who spokein this area recently."
1,Short and silly,I had to read this book because it was selected by my book club. Had I read it when I was 12 it might have been fun. The stories are written at a childish level and to market this as anything other than a Nancy Drew level book is astounding. Fortunately it is over and done with quickly.
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I probably shouldn't even contribute since I only read about 25 pages of this, but I just couldn't ""get into"" this book because I found the author's writing style self-consciously quaint (maybe ""twee"" is the right word), boring, and overall irritating. It's a pet peeve of mine when an author refers to a character by his full name EVERY SINGLE TIME he mentions the character -- for example, ""Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni did this. Then Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni did that. Then Mma. Ramotswe asked Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni to do this for her..."" Tedious! Is there some literary value to that endless repetition that I'm not aware of?"
3,A Stretch,"I'm sorry...but comparing this main character to Uncle Abner and Judge Dee is a real stretch...this is an OK book, but I don't think it will stand the test of time anywhere near as well as the Abner and Dee mysteries. It's ""light."""
2,Uninteresting,"Read this for my book club, across the boards we were unimpressed. Easy to read but pretty surface level stories. Elementary plots."
3,THE No. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY,"~This novel has been on my reading list for a long time, and I was excited to finally have the time to read, The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency. I wanted to like it, however...I didn't, not really. Yes, it was charming enough, in a cute way, but nothing about it grabbed a hold of me, and motivated me to keep reading. It was mostly a series of short stories about Mma Ramotswe, a women living in Africa who owns her own detective agency. Most chapters consisted of a different client with a mystery to solve, and ended with Mma Ramotswe cleverly figuring it all out. None of the chapters relate to each other, and I didn't think the individual cases were at all exciting or interesting. However, I did finish it, and it wasn't horrible, so I'm giving it 2 stars."
3,Something more and something less,"This book is both something more and something less than the Agatha Christie-type novel set in Africa that I was expecting. It is something more in that many relatively minor characters a fully developed. For example, our heroine's father's life story is told and it is both interesting and moving. The book is something less in that there is no Agatha Christie-type mystery here. Certainly there are various mysteries solved as individual client's needs are addressed but there is no primary mystery that makes up the plot. Further, the reader will be able to solve many of the minor mysteries before our heroine does.As a small business owner, I can attest that this book does more-or-less accurately address the basic concerns of small business owners (as, indeed, All Creatures Great and Small does).I would have preferred the addition of a locked room murder that has stymied the police or some such."
2,BOR-ing,"If you like strictly episodic books with no character development, no dramatic arc, and occasionally trite prose, this is the book for you. What's more, the solution to each of the little ""mysteries"" (and I use the term loosely) was, by and large, predictable, including the sappy ending. I don't generally read mystery books, and maybe that's the problem -- but so many people recommended this thing that I tried to ignore the hype and dove in. What a waste of time when there are so many really good books out there to read..."
4,Charming,"I don't know how many times I have walked past the latest in this series and thought to myself 'Perhaps one day I should read his books'. Well I finally got round to doing just that and I'm so glad I did. At times this book was moving and a little sad, but overall it was the literary equivalent to a delicious slice of Apple Pie, warm, homely and comforting. Best enjoyed with a cup of hot Red Bush tea."
4,Comfortable and entertaining,"My book club was looking for an easy stress free book after a few heavier, intense works when I found this series. It took a couple of chapters to engage but then I fell in love with the main character and Bostwana! I bought all the other books available in the series before finishing. Clever and wholesome -I am encouraging my teenage daughters to read it too."
5,Charming doesn't even begin to describe it! Life-affirming!,"Personally, I'm not a mystery fan, and I only read this at the urging of a friend. Imagine my surprise when a book I thought was about English ladies meeting in a parlor over tea to solve crimes turned out to be about a African folk hero and role model to women everywhere (who just happens to solve mysteries, in addition to fixing her friends lives, and running her business, and helping her community). To recount the pure joy of reading this book, I would have to cut and paste every line into my review. So what are you waiting for? This is a true gem not to be missed by readers of all ages! My high school sister, my mother, and my grandmother all adored the tales. I also highly recommend this as a book club selection (the Today show never disappoints with their selections)."
3,"A Quick, Pleasant Read","Again, this book was chosen for one of my bookclubs and this one is ok. It's not the world's greatest nor a thought-provoking read. This book fits the bill of snuggling under the blanket on a cold autumn day and read of the hot desert air in Africa. This is not a typical mystery either. It is a pleasant rambling of life in Africa. It is also a very predictable mystery book (I wouldn't even call it a mystery novel).This book is the first in the series (which I probably won't read the rest) and it is about a woman named Precious who opened up a business and she is a detective. She looks for straying husbands, lost kids, and other cases. This book is a jumble of several cases where she finds the answer very easily. It is a cute book but again, very predictable.This is perfect for those cold days when you have time to read a book in its entirety. If you like Agatha Christie novels, you will like this one.10/22/08"
3,Short Vingettes,"This is less of one cohesive story and more short vignettes that tie into one novel. For a long drive where one is falling asleep and waking up again this was a good thing. I did enjoy this audiobook the narrator was enjoyable to listen to but at times with road noise was hard to hear. Precious Ramotswe, the lady detective, was an interesting character and I enjoyed listening to a story that was set outside of the United States.Botswana where the story was set played a big role in the stories. Some of the vignettes where very specific to Africa and couldn't happen anyplace else. Witch doctor's and corruption cases are solved by Romotswe in often funny and satisfying ways that don't seem to be a stretch of reality in the slightest.I would recommend this novel to those that want something to listen to on a drive."
1,"Fantastic keyboard, but not this 5 pack","I love this keyboard and have been only using this keyboard since at least 2001. It is sturdy and doesn't have extra features, it isn't wireless, and it is a bit of a quirky key layout that bothers some people (the arrow keys are smaller than on many keyboards) - but I love it.The reason for my low rating on this product is not on the keyboard, but on this actual sales page.It says that this is a 5 pack of keyboards, and when I ordered it, a single keyboard came. I sent it back to Amazon, they apologized and said they would send the proper 5 pack. They then sent me another single keyboard. I sent it back, they refunded my money, and I bought the 5 pack elsewhere.Hopefully that is all resolved now, but after talking to other people who have had similar issues with Amazon when buying multi-packs and only getting a single unit - be wary.I love Amazon and buy a ton of stuff from them, and will continue to do so, but I will not be buying multi-packs from them."
1,don't bother,"I tried twice to order this item. Apparently there's a problem on the warehouse end -- both times only one keyboard arrived. If this item is actually a five-pack, then the DC needs to correct which item is delivered when this item is ordered. If it's *not* a five-pack, somebody needs to correct the description (and the price!) in the database, or delete the entry entirely.Oh, and the topper was when my *second* complaint email received this gem in reply: ""Since it's likely another replacement would arrive defective, I won't trouble you with another order.""Worst. Amazon. Experience. Ever. :("
3,language problem,I was very disappointed that the movie was not in the original Italian. This has happened with two movies I ordered. There was no way in the desciption to distinguish if the movies were in Italian or English. Please ask your distributors to be more specific about the language. I did not want the movies dubbed in English. I am not satisfied with the purchase. Please try to revise the descriptions of the foreign films. Thank you.
5,best cthulhu adventure ever,"I think that the title to this review says it all. The Masks of Nyarlathotep is by far the best cthulhu adventure that i have played (much better than Delta Green), due to the feeling of, well, 'authenticity' and adventure. But most of all lots of fun. Easily a choise for one of my top 5 modules of any gaming system."
4,The Art of Bluegrass Rhythm Guitar,"Chris Jones does a great job of demonstrating proper rhythm guitar technique. In addition to rhythm, he gives examples of bass runs which are executed slowly at first, then at tempo, making them easily learned by most beginners. Overall, the material is well done, great lighting, closeups,etc. This coupled with Chris'articulate presentational skills makes for an enjoyable and informative instructional session. My only criticism, more left hand shots showing the chord forms that accompany the strumming patterns.Chris Jones deserves a hardy round of applause for producing this fine instructional dvd."
4,Not what I expected,"Although this book is not at all what I expected (it is what it says it is: ""an account of the meaning and symbolism of Ikebana"" which I somehow missed before I ordered the book), it is well written and offers excellent information. If you want a greater understanding of the art form, then this is an excellent book. If you're hoping for illustrations to go along with that understanding, then this is not it."
4,A Small Gem,"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend who admires and utilizes an Asian sensibility in her decor. Before sending it to her, I read a few sections and found more understanding for myself, of the place that minimal and simplistic design elements can have on the energy of one's surroundings. It helped me to draw a similarity between what I like about abstract art and the elegant and serene feel of Ikebana arrangements."
4,freestyle surprise performance,"ANY ONE INTO SAFIRE,J.TORRES,CYNTHIA AND LIL SUSY,CHECK THIS ONE OUT! FOLLOW UP TO HER SELF-TITLED ALBUM, WITH GREAT HITS as ""OUR LOVE"" &THIS IS THE LAST TIME,THIS ONE IS A MUST FOR ANY ONE INTO FREESTYLE! GREAT DANCE SONGS SUCH AS ,CATCH ME NOW,QUESTION OF LOVE,AND REMAKE OF THIS IS THE LAST TIME,THE SONG THAT PLACED LAURA AT THE TOP OF FREESTYLE..."
2,not for a 3-year old,"My daughter is 7 and can confidently manipulate fitting the small sprites in the different areas of the playset. However, I cannot see how a 3-year old would have the dexterity to accomplish this. Also,I think the small parts and sprites would still pose a choking hazard."
5,Other poor reviewers--You Must be kidding!?,"My daughter is a barbie enthusiest! There isn't much she doesn't have in the fantasy line of barbie's. But I do have this to say to the other poor reviews...You must be kidding! My 5 and 6 year olds LOVE this toy!!! They play with it very often and have had it ever since the day it hit the market. As a parent, if you read the instructions, and follow them (they are extremely simple!) they explain how everything works. Plus with a little common sense you can figure it out easily. Unless you have a child that is unbelieably hard on toys and breaks every thing...then your child will be getting a GREAT Barbie toy. There are a few small parts. I do highly recommend this toy! It is wonderful and ours is in perfect shape...same as the day we bought it. It is played with quite often."
4,Beautiful but difficult,"It is rated for ages 3 and up but I would't get it for anyone under 6 because there are a lot of small pieces. It is also a major pain to put together. Once it's set up however, it is quite pretty and there are lots of activities to do with your faeries."
3,cheap cheap cheap,"My daughter recieved this toy for christmas and while it is pretty, she bored with it easily and she put it aside quickly. She did enjoy the litte play time she spent with it.Also I found it difficult to put together and found the construction very flimsy. It is overpriced for the quality of the toy. It is not worth it buy your child another play set. Something with some sort of educational value and more durability. My daughter isn't even hard on toys and pieces kept falling off."
4,Vewry cute,"My daughter loves this . The secret rooms in this are a lot of fun, and the dolls are so cute . Nice Quality!!This is a great toy for a little girl !!!!A little bit tricky to get dolls to balance in swing and spin, but not bad."
2,Wish it would have stayed together better,"We bought this last Christmas for our 4 year old,it did put together very easy, and the fairies would fly but the thing kept coming apart everytime i turned around my daughter was asking me to fix something,even when i was playing with her the pieces kept breaking off.I have read the good reviews and all i can say is maybe yours came out of a better batch, my daughter really didn't get a chance to play with it much because of the continous breaking and finally we just threw it out. This year she wants the Magic of Pegasus cloud kingdom I really hope this toy is a little more durable."
5,I Hail to the great warriors of METAL,"The music It's like some indescribible thing specially such magnificent and awesome sample of beauty like this. The couple Turilli-Staropolli It's the greatest in the nowadays metal I think. They got everything virtuositi, genius and a ...huge touch of epic braveness. I could try to describe this CD writing this: It have the best epic-fantasy lyrics, a beaty-powerfull orchestation, blasting guitar and keys solos and one of the best range vocals and the most dramatic-felled vocals for sure. This is not that kind of copycat cd of Bands like manowar, this... is the begining of the best Italian-band ever gather and the answer of god for thousands of people that dream with the old ages, dragons, magic and courage... Like me... May god light your way Italian warriors"
4,Great Debut,"Rhapsody takes the epic-power-melodic metal to the next step. Really good arrangements in order to magnify the ""epic"" elements in metal. Luca Turilli is a great guitar player too."
5,An office with integrity,"I used this recording more for study than pure listening pleasure, and to that end it was extremely helpful. The recording included many of the Nocturn lections from the Vita Quarta ""Life of Brigid"" as well as the office chants which derive from those lections. The recitation of the lections is not meant to be musically entertaining per se, but they preserve the integrity of the office and contextualize the antiphons and responsories which in turn contextualize the psalms. The liner notes are also very informative and helpful on an important office which has received little scholarly attention."
5,Russ Freeman keeps doing better work,"One of the hallmarks of a true artist is that he keeps developing and improving. Russ Freeman and the Rippingtons have consistently done polished and enjoyable stuff -- with this CD (and his prior effort, Black Diamond), Russ Freeman has advanced further, applying his very high standards of craftsmanship to work that involves underlying thematic material and a unifying sense of style that makes this CD a ""whole"" and not just a collection of cuts."
4,Pretty Good,"The Rippingtons is a band that does themes and popular music. There are three different types of songs on this album, southwestern (tracks 1,6,8,10), smooth jazz (tracks 2,3,5), and latin (tracks 4,7,9). As of right now smooth jazz and latin are really popular and southwestern was the album's theme. The Rippingtons have been doing this with all of their albums so I don't know why some people think its not the Rippingtons. I really miss Jeff Kashiwa and others who didn't appear on this album (Paul Taylor was kind of disapointing) thats why I gave it four stars instead of five."
1,What is this?,I must admit I was left scratching my head. On every Ripps cd (even Wildcard and Let it Ripp) there are at least a few tracks I like. This is one of the few cds I dislike from start to finish. I listened to it twice. Once after I purchased it in 2003 and once earlier this year. I've yet to put it back in the cd player.
5,Feel good summertime CD,"What a perfect, drive around in your car with the windows down(finally) CD! Every cut got me in the mood for the summer we've all been waiting for. It's upbeat and it's got me reading travel brochures to the Southwest-what a great sound."
2,A Rippington Fan for years......,"This is another dissapointment for me. I do belive this CD is too ""Latin/Spacey"" type and lacks movement like the early years of the Rippingtons. I borrowed the CD to sample and it looks like I'll pass on this one. Are the Rippingtons turning into a New Age type of Fusion Band? Could be, to go along with the Windham Hil label. oh well keep up the good work guys and pump out a good one that COOKS next time!"
2,'Wish I were more enthusiastic....,"I've liked or loved all but the last three studio CDs that Russ Freeman and the Rippingtons have put out. I hope that I don't offend other lovers of the Rippingtons and Russ Freeman, but I guess that I'm hooked on their latin flavored songs. I've listened to this CD three times and don't remember anything specific about it. I, by no means, want to discourage others from checking out this CD, but this is a place to review their work so it seems appropriate.I really miss Jeff Kashiwa's playing. The fact that Russ Freeman played so many of the instruments on many of this CD's songs might tend to homogenize the sound somewhat, too. I do like Russ Freeman's CD with David Benoit and Craig Chaquico and all the older Rippington and/or Russ Freeman CDs."
3,"Kind of anemic at times, but still worthy of a listen","Not a stellar CD by old Rippington's standards, but some very nice moments do exist. I became a Rippington's fan based on the high energy arrangements of the early albums like Moonlighting, Tourist in Paradise, Weekend in Monaco, etc., and really miss the BIG sound and mutliple grooves. If this is what you are looking for, don't buy this CD. Pardon my ignorance of track names as I do not have the CD sitting next to me, but one of the tracks sounds exactly like the title cut from the Spyro Gyra CD, ""Heart of the Night."" Anyone else notice this??? What little sax stuff is on the album is nice, but agree with a previous comment about missing Jeff Kashiwa. A nice highlight was some of the piano solos! Russ Freeman, if you read this, I appreciate your desire to move into new areas and am pleased that the annoying Hip-Hop backbeat stuff has all but diappeared on this album, but as the old Wendy's commercial said, Where's the beef??"
2,Not inspiring,"Not inspiring at all! I have to echo the sentiments of some of the previous reviewers, it reads more like what money can buy for a bunch of insufferably boring CEO's. And the author, should have got a better editor and concentrated more on the climbs rather than glorifying Bass & Wells.For truly inspiring and touching mountaineering books, read Into Thin Air or Touching The Void.I should have really been forewarned given that Clint Eastwood, recommends the book.(At least on the cover of my book).Although, to Bass's credit, its extremely cool that he managed to climb these after he was 50."
3,"This isn't a concept, its a way of life!","I was really outraged by a reader's comment where he said that it was a cool concept to climb the 7S.This isn't a concept it's an ultimate rush to mountain heads, like me. Everyone knows that you can't rush into doing the the 7S, you need to work your way up through smaller peaks and various different levels of difficulty.The so called ""concept"" is more of a death sentence, it takes years to build adequate strength to muster and challenge most of the 7S."
1,What Money Can Buy,"This book, in the main, is nothing more than hubris in print. Wells and Bass typify the attitude of today's wealthy elitists: the belief that because they have lots of money, they are somehow ennobled and entitled to everything the world has, including the world's highest mountain peaks.Skip this book. If you want to read good mountaineering lore, try ""Annapurna"" by Maurice Herzog, or Hillary's account of his climb of Everest."
4,Inspirational story of a never-give-up attitude!,"Having been recommended by my boss I was skeptical, but this book proved to be a great motivating tool. The two main characters had a specific goal in mind, made the necessary sacrifices to reach it, and never gave up. This was great reading. It makes we want to climb!"
1,True heroes but lousy author,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer, I was eager to read more about the people who climb the tallest mountains. While I admire Frank and Dick's success, particulary considering their age, I couldn't help get the impression that this book was one long accolade to the men rather than the accomplishment. It felt like two very ego-driven, very successful men had manipulated a two-bit author into writing about how wonderful they were. I never once got the sense of loneliness and fear of being above 26,000 feet (the ""Death Zone"") that Krakauer wrote about so well."
2,Poorly written,"This book reminds me of athlete biographies written for kids. All the characters are presented as totally one-dimensional cliches-- business leaders who refuse to lose, tough-acting butchy women with hearts of gold-- all your favorites are here! You're forced to read page after page of detailed conversations that are clearly fictionalized. The author bends over backwards in an effort to elevate Bass and Wells to superhero status. All of this can get very annoying! The bottom line, as I understand it, is that Bass and Wells did something that they should be very proud of. By treating their adventure as a world-class mountaineering accomplishment (which it clearly was not) the author actually detracts from the story."
2,"Less Mountains, More Sap",This book is definitely not one to purchase if you are looking for detailed accounts of climbing these mountains.We read far more about the planning and personal lives of these men; neither of whom is interesting enough to command this attention. The dialogue between the two men is incredibly canned and sappy and Ridgeway tries in vain to capture the true feelings resulting from these ascents. You would probably be better off reading individual guides if you want to get a feel for these climbs. There are definitely better books on the subject.
5,Excellent book about determination!,This book was hard to put down when I started reading it. The fact that two established business men with little experience could just decide to climb all seven highest peaks was unbelievable. So many of us dream but do not have the resources to go after that dream. It was fun reading about two men that could pursue their dream. I was really impressed with Frank's willingness to put his family ahead of his dream. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys true adventure stories.
3,Learned a lot about the 7 Summits and climbing by amateurs,"This is one of the books I read when my interest in mountain climbing adventures was first starting. At the time, I liked it. But since then, I must say that I have read many books more exciting, fast paced, gripping, than this. I did like the humor in the book and the characters were interesting. And I really learned a lot about the 7 Summits.For other books that I found gripping and well worth reading, see my other reviews or my listmania list. I am an avid reader of true adventure and/or survival stories."
5,Seven Summits - Outstanding!!,"Seven Summits is a fantastic, inspirational book that is twisted with suspense, action, and tragedy. Frank Wells, a Warner Bros. executive, and Dick Bass, set out on the adventure of their lives. Both Frank and Dick overcome not just physical obstacles, but mental obstacles as well. Definitely a must-get, must-read book. If you start to read it, you won't put it down. Check it out here at Amazon or at your local library!"
5,great product,I have had this for quite a while and they are really great. I would suggest that if you needed this to complete your set you won't be disappointed.
1,Bad Return,"The item came to me broken and when I returned it for a credit, was only given 1/2 of my credit back. Was not very pleased with the level of customer service I received. I will think twice again before I purchase more dishes from this vendor."
4,Nice stamp,Stamp is nice but hard to do it correct due to everytthing is mirrorwise. Could have been more space on the pad for more letters
1,hard to use and looks crappy,"dont bother with this stamp. it is hard to use, clumsy and the stamp looks as cheap as it was made."
1,I WANT ONE. BUT U CAN'T IF YOUR IN SPAIN,"I WOULD LIKE TO BUY ONE, BUT THEY DONT SEND TO SPAIN. I CANT FIND A WAY OF GETTING THIS EXACT ONE.ANYBODY CAN HELP?"
5,Absolutely a Wonderful book,This is a must read for all seriously swimmers or fans of Olympic swimming. I enjoy it a lot. I hope the author or the publisher will have a updated version covering up to London Olympics. Lot of interesting insights and great untold stories.
3,CHECK FOR THE RIGHT ONE,"There are two bags that looks the same. Choose the one that is fitted to securely store your FBV Shortboard, and has one pouch on each side of the bag, one for the cables and one to store your pod xt or x3. The name is Line 6 FBV SB/POD XT Bag http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLIYB2/ref=oss_product"
1,...,"I gave this to my fiance, who is a hunter for many years. I really thought he would absolutly love it! but really he had it in the closet for 6 months because it was to hard to set up or something... and after he got it ready to go he still doesn't really uses it... he thinks it does not work."
5,Fascinating!!!,"I ordered this wonderful treasure several months ago. I thought I would be purchasing it just for myself, but once my husband got his hands on it, I lost ownership! We both absolutley love it. Peggy Fleming truly has an eye for capturing the moment. We love ""In Her Place"" and highly suggest checking it out! So inspirational!"
4,Delightful Respite,"Peggy's photographs take me deep into the veins of life, flowing with energy and wisdom as she peers into the everyday places where we do our real living. The 56 women who speak to me on these pages offer me a place to sit, reflect, and find my own 'place'. It is a delicious collection-"
5,A book of sanctuary that IS a sanctuary,"""In Her Place"" is a large and beautiful book that I am honored to have on my coffee table. It is a transparent look at the private worlds of women like you and me and our families. The words and images are poetic and intimate, openings to inner places that are not always visible or acknowledged. This beautful book of photographs and prose poems would make a great gift for a mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend."
5,Knowing and Feeling Your Place,"Most of us have a certain place that feels just right when we need security or nourishment for life or simply time away. This book of insightful photographs and accompanying text affirms the variety and significance of places in the lives of a diverse array of women. A reader can feel through photographs and words the pleasure that each of these women feels in her place of choice.The book is accessible, beautiful but not esoteric. It is one that you can pick up to experience a few or many of the entries and then return again and again. In fact, it becomes a ""place"" to go for inspiration and enjoyment."
4,"Great songs, great album cover!",A lot of great songs on this one. You're So Vain will always be one of my favorites. People still wonder who she was singing about in it. A lot of people think it's Warren Beatty but my guess is game show host Wink Martindale.There was some controversy when this album came out because Carly isn't wearing a bra on the cover. I don't see why anyone got upset. There's a couple of things I really like about the picture!
5,Wonderfully Captivating,"I grew up listening to this album and loved it then. Now since I bought the CD, I cannot stop playing it! It is a truly beautiful CD with one song after another of beautiful music, meaningful lyrics, and pure enjoyment."
5,One of the best Audio Fidelity remasters,What a joy it was listening to this remastered version of Carly Simon's No Secrets. Audio Fidelity has a winner here. There is a depth to the soundscape that is hard to reproduce during the mastering stage. Dynamics are preserved making this a must-have for all serious and casual Carl Simon fans. You won't find a better sounding version of this release out there.
5,The best,"I bought this album when it first came out years ago, and I don't know why I waited so long to buy the CD. It's fabulous."
4,Readably Frightening !,George W Bush should be made to read this book. The author addresses many global water problems in a well researched and highly readable form. Read it and be afraid - we should be demanding our nitwit lawmakers read it and take action. Give a copy to your neighbors.
2,Zoom,"The picture quality is great but if you're interested in the zoom feature, look somewhere else. The camera does not even zoom to what you can see with your naked eye."
3,Mixed Bag,"I purchased mine in 1999 for its compact size and bang-for-the-buck. It is currently dying a slow death, as the sliding door mechanism has failed. The camera will shut-off if the door is bumped, forcing you to close and reopen. Also, indoor pix are washed-out by the flash. Don't know if that is unique to Olympus. Next time, I'll give Canon a chance."
2,"nice pictures, not durable","I have purchased this camera in 1999. I have used it for a few times. The pictures came out great. However, it did not work like 13 months later. When I moved the shell to turn the camera on, it did not turn on at all. I can hear the motor is running. But it was not working at all. Since it is already over one year old, I have to pay to get fixed. It will cost me like almost a hundred dollars. I just bought another camera then. I was disappointed that it did not last as long I want it to."
1,don't buy it,"We bought this camera 1 year ago and it does take great pictures, but it has 1 major flaw. The lens cover which slides over the lens has a bearing and a spring under it which serve as the mechanism which holds the lens open or closed and tells the camera whether to retract the lens to off position or leave it out for a photo. The mechanism gave out on our camera and upon taking it to a store for repair the service rep. says he sees the same problem a few times a week and that it is so common that he is having a hard time getting replacement parts. This causes the lens to suddenly retract as you are about to take a pictue at random intervals. I know two other people that have the same camera and the same problem. It appears to be a design flaw in the whole Epic line of cameras. It is around 70-80 dollars to fix and for that you might as well buy a new camera."
1,"Good design, poor execution",Great camera as long as it works. The lense cover slide broke after about a year. I got it fixed and it broke again after 6 months
5,"Tough, Durable, and Good Pics!","I used this camera on a 408 mile hike from Lake Tahoe to Mt Whitney and all my pictures turned out great. On top of that, I passed 2 other people who were unrelated who both claimed to have dropped their Olympus Stylus into streams. They both said that the camera continued working even after being submerged in water briefly.In addition, when I arrived on the summit of Whitney, there were two professional photographers up there who had carried like 50lbs of photography gear. They both said that they owned Olympus Stylus cameras for carrying in their cars and spur-of-the-moment occasions. They said they chose that camera because of the good optics that Olympus makes.We have retired our stylus in favor of a new Olympus Camedia 3040 zoom, but we still use the Stylus when we need two cameras. It still takes good pics."
4,Great Camera for the price,"I am pretty pleased with this purchase. The camera is really nice and seems pretty sturdy. My chief complaint though is that it is super slow opening up. Well, it seems really slow. Maybe I am a product of the instant gratification crowd, but it is a little annoying when you have the must take quickly picture opportunity. I guess you just get used to it. Overall, however, I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Pic quality bad-do you want Zoom really?,"I bought this camera for my wife. She wanted a tiny but reliable camera so I read all reviews here and got it. But when I picked up the first printed pictures, I was really disappointed. Was it a problem of mine? I think the picture quality is the most important feature. It is not sharp at all. My wife used to have cheaper (no zoom) Canon but she lost it. I think that made much better picture. If it didn't, I wouldn't have purchased autofocus camera again. I suspected Zoom function. The moving of lens part looks unstable. But I am not sure whether it is the problem of particulary my camera or whole products. I just think I didn't need a small camera with zoom function at all."
1,Very Sad,"I was so excited about purchasing my first zoom camera. In the past I have only used cameras with the max purchase price of [amt]. Needless to say, it only made it through about 3 rolls of film. This only took about 7 months, it certainly wasn't overworked. I am so disappointed, they are more expensive to fix than they are worth. You are better off with a disposable."
2,THIS CAMERA IS DEFECTIVE,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. It is defective. I bought 3 of these cameras Dec 2001. Within a year they broke. The lens jams and will not extend on the camera...it happened to all 3 of my Olympus 80 cameras. This is a design flaw common to this series of Olympus cameras. If you buy this camera you will be sorry...if you already bought this camera...you are sorry now.
1,curious,"i really wanted to buy this one but the problem is i am curious on where this camera is made. it is not written in the product specs & in the 'see it in action' part, it cannot be tilted downward so that i can see whether its made in u.s. or japan etc. i dont want to end up buying something that is made in china."
2,Broke after 2 years,"At first I really loved this camera; it took great quality photos and the best part was that it was cute and compact...I really loved the design. But after 2 years of use, it's rewind mechanism suddenly stopped working, and I don't think it was dropped or mishandled in any way. It usually has automatic rewind feature, but one day, it made a funny whirring noise as it ""rewinded"" when in actuality it didn't rewind at all.Needless to say, I opened the cover to take out the film and the roll was ruined from the light exposure. I was very disappointed not only because the camera broke, but because I lost some great photos. The repair shop told me it would cost [$$$] to repair, I didn't think it was worth it so I'm now searching for a more reliable camera. I don't think I will buy another Olympus camera for a long time to come."
3,"Sliding door failed after minimal usage, otherwise great","I really loved this camera, but the sliding ""door"" broke and wouldn't close after only a few months of minimal usage. I don't know if I got a lemon, or what. The camera was never dropped or otherwise abused. I had had another Olympus for years with the same design, that worked great--it's really easy to get quick shots when you can slide off the lens cover and turn on the camera all in one quick motion ; I will most likely try another one even after my bad experience with this one. I hope that they have solved this issue, if it was widespread--at least one other reviewer mentioned the same problem..."
4,"""Works hard for the money""","This is a nice travel/home camera. The body is durable, yet light and fits easily into a breast or cargo pocket. I've had no problems with the mechanics other than a strange appearance in the lower part of the viewer--a small piece of something that should probably not be there but does not affect the picture at all. Definately get a strap for it--the body is a bit slippery, especially in damp/humid environments. No need to send it over the falls. Pictures are clear and sharp. The functions are easy to use with a little review of the instructions."
1,Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 ate my film!,"I bought this camera as a gift for my beautiful and very pregnant wife. She wanted a camera with a nice zoom to take pictures of our baby who is expected to arrive any day now. I've had Olympus cameras in the past that worked great and was excited to get this one for her. Sadly, this camera ruined 5 rolls of film. It doesn't load or advance film correctly. We sent it back and the baby will probably be here before we get a replacement camera!"
2,Great when it works but it didn't last a year,this camera worked fine for a while but then slide piece came off and the camera stopped working....cost too much to fix......don't buy...too much for a throw away..
3,Wait for the Deluxe Model,"All Olympus Stylus Zoom cameras are being replaced with the Deluxe model. It comes with some neat features, like view finder confirmation (the viewfinder darkens at the moment the picture is taken to confirm.) They also all come with panoramic mode now. They have just been released in higher-end camera stores, and will probably be available here soon."
1,Disappointed,"After reading all the wonderful reviews, I couldn't wait to go out and buy this camera. I was VERY disappointed in the quality of the pictures - not sharp or clear at all!! The photo quality is that of a disposable camera. In fact, while on vacation, we bought our daughter a disposable camera to take her own pictures, and when I had it developed along with the film from the Olympus Zoom 80...I couldn't tell which pictures came from which camera. Bottom line, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,"Great pictures, if you can get it to work","I have had problems w/ this camera since the day it was purchased. For some reason when you press down the button to take a picture, nothing happens. I've had about a 50/50 chance of ever getting it to snap a picture. I always keep a spare camera on hand, because you cannot rely on this camera to take a picture. Do not use this camera if you want to take pics of anything important, because you may not get any!"
5,Really Good,"At first I did not want to buy these because they were the pyramid brand, and I hear lots of bad stuff about their products. I just went ahead and bought these to put in my ride, and I was pleased with the results. The sound quality is very good, and when I turn the music all the way up they don't get distorted because they have built in cross overs and that's another plus. These speakers are good if you want to add more highs, to your ride so people can hear you coming down the block."
5,An Author's Note,"I helped write this book, the brainchild of editor and co-author Brian Caswell. Brian's the most excellent Snort Rules king, as well as an employee at Sourcefire. Mike Poor, of SANS fame, and Toby Kohlenberg, an extremely capable and enterprise-experienced IDS guy, also edited. The author team on this massively-updated book includes several other people with amazing experience and drive to make a great book.I like to think that, following Brian's design, we've created a book that's useful to experienced Snorters to new IDS users to programmers. Heck, Andrew Baker, in writing his chapter on Barnyard, actually developed major changes to the tool in response to the questions he raised as he wrote."
4,Parental Guidance Recommended,"I read the abridged version of Remote Control and decided to read the unabridged version to see what I had missed. I discovered that I had missed nothing more than a large amount of swearing and plenty of graphic violence. I recommend this book to anyone, but would promote the abridged version as the better option, as the story is not adversely affected by the 'chopping' of several parts."
4,Good Book,"I picked this up in Amsterdam. Not a bad work of fiction. McNab gets a couple of the guns wrong and I thought the name Nick Stone, to be a little lame in the start. But, overall, I never got bored and really enjoyed the book. Cameron Spence wrote another good book about the SAS in the Gulf and has written a work of fiction. Neither is available in the US, too bad."
4,Outstanding first work of fiction,"Following in the footsteps of Chris Ryan, and becoming a full time author, MacNab has made an outstanding jump from autobigraphical work to fiction. I found the book to be 'un put a downable' and all the time I was reading it I couldn't help thinking I can't wait for the film. I don't want to spoil the story more than saying it's good guy against bad goverenment - US and UK. There is blood and gore and a fine attention to detail that makes it a must. I can't wait until the next book"
4,McNab knows his stuff,"I read one of the early McNab books in which he relates details about his time with the SAS, but with a strong narrative style. Kept me turning the pages when so often non-fiction bio-based books can be stale, so I was intrigued how this entry into fiction might go.For the most part McNab pulled it off as we get sucked into a tale whereby our hero has to protect the life of a seven-year old girl, Kelly. One criticism is that we could have seen a bit more from the girl's POV, and the depth of detail was at points a bit too heavy and so slowed down the action. But overall this was a sterling effort and I'm sure more will be seen of McNab in the fiction arena."
3,Not bad ! (who wrote it?),"Not a bad book, although one would expect something more at the end. Only question is who is the real hero this time. When bullets fly, McNab is the hero, but when keyboards work overtime, someone else should get the appropriate credit. Come on, mr. McNab, you of all people should know that SigSauer pistols DO NOT HAVE SAFETY LEVERS! It takes just a little detail like this to give away the game... Anyway, not a bad book, not bad at all."
1,Soooo slow.,It is a long time since i read a book that slow and boring.But now i know a lot about the streets and hotel rooms in Washington D.C.I also know how to operate an old VHS tape-recorder.Everything is just so slow and detailed that u will probably go to sleep very fast.I did.
3,Straight shooter,"Experienced SAS operator Andy McNab deserves credit for sparing us the predictable Hollywood-style action novel. He keeps things realistic: long on tradecraft details and short on gratuitous action.Beneath a thin international intrigue veneer, what we really have here is an unromanticized glimpse into the tedious, unexciting day-to-day drudgery of witness-protection work. Spywork, fights and shoot-outs do take place, but the writer shows great discipline and keeps the bang-bang restrained within the context of the mission at hand.If you're expecting spec ops action a' la Rainbow Six, sass like Richard Marcinko, or spy dramas in John Le Carre's style, you'll have to go elsewhere.I vote 5 stars for realism, 3 stars for overall reading enjoyment. In any event, Andy McNab looks to have a very promising future as a writer of special operations novels."
2,"Tedious, Predictible","You know how some people, when they tell a story, have to give you every...single...detail and by the time they get to the point, you are past caring. That's how McNab is -- only to add to the misery,his main character is dragging a little girl around with him. And we have to hear about every street they go down, every hotel room they inhabit. And, on one hand, the author makes you think that capture could come at any minute. Yet, the character has time to buy clothes for the little girl, right in the heat of the chase. Spare me! The book just plods along with little excitement and little plot development. In fact, the plot seems to go nowhere. McNab is better writing non-fiction. I can't understand all the positive reviews here. It must be a British thing."
3,Good reading but an unpleasant tone of violence sometimes,"Good book, but in contrary to his book Bravo Two Zero and Chris Ryans books, this one does contain a few unpleasant tones of over-violence. The tone is that in an E&E-situation, be as violent as possible, the main character would not hesitate killing a cop, since ""ultimately that is what they are paid for"", etc. Too bad for an otherwise excellent book."
2,A Fugitive's Manual,"With all due respect to Andy, I think he should stick with writing true crime/non-fiction books as he did before (""Immediate Action"" and ""Bravo Two Zero""; both great, especially the latter one).There is a good thing, though, that comes out of this book. I learned how to go into hiding, how to evade the enemy, how to conduct survaillance, how to lose people in the crowds, how to lie when checking into hotels, how to ditch cars and never use credit cards while on the run. Not to mention how to make home-made bombs using kitchen cleaners. It's a good guide on what to do while hiding from government agencies or 'other organizations'. ""A Fugitive's Manual"".Otherwise, as a fiction novel, it's not all that good. But I still appreciate the tips!"
5,"Outpaces Dean Ing, Out ""Tradecraft's"" Tom Clancy","You can read synopses of the story above - probably already did. I'd like to share my response to this book: I found it so gripping that my jaw was tight throughout the entire read - which, by the way, lasted all night since I couldn't put it down to go to bed. This is a suspenseful drama with characters who grow on you. (Did me, anyway.) An exciting story with what looks like real tradecraft sprinkled throughout the book.If you liked Clancy's Without Remorse, I think you'll love this book. If you like Clancy, look up McNab, and then Dean Ing. Ing used to write SF (which is so good that many non SF'ers enjoy them) but now writes (damfino what to call them. Let's try:) Techno-Thrillers.Can't say too much about Remote Control. If you like adventure, spy type novels, this is one of the best - most gripping and exciting."
2,Remote husband,Great setting for a crime - everyone snowbound or snowblind perhaps. The psychologist/sleuth is only a husband bringing hiswife's purse to the hospital. A good read if you enjoy lawyers in trouble
4,On Action Fantastic - On Human Relationships -not so good...,"Superb beginning - one of the few books I couldn't put down . Extremely realistic and exciting. However during the second part of the book I was put off by the heroes relationship with the little girl. I didn't find this convincing at all and so gave up interest having to skip the bonding nonsense. Stick to the action Andy, this is your strength and few can do it better - you know it makes sense!"
5,Couldnt put it down,"This book was great. I could not put it down. He had me in suspense the whole way through, making it seem like he was never going to get out of his situation. He works your emotions, from describing those terrible murders, to finding out his best friend had deceived him. This is a must read."
3,"Excellent thriller but, left me hanging at the end.","It is said write about what you know, Andy McNab knows his trade-craft. The story is well plotted and moves quickly. However,the shadow group involving drug cartel,DEA and British Intelligence is poorly defined. The major flaw in a good novel is the ending, just left me hanging!"
5,Brilliant jazz/pop forgotten by the public,"I first discovered Vanessa Daou though an artist profile. I anxiously picked up this album and was blown away. The poetry of Erica Jong weaved thoughout a smoky jazz tapestry is quite siimply brilliant. It's a shame more albums by Vanessa (and other artists like her) go unnoticed by the public when so much crap charts and sells well.Take note of ""Becoming A Nun"" and ""My love Is Too Much"". These tracks stand out not only for their poetic contribution but for the smooth musical backbones.If you sort of like Sade, Jill Scott or even Enigma, then you will LOVE this album!"
2,Where is the rest of my CD?,"How do you send me a CD without its booklet??? i bought the CD for a reason, so when i look at the case i know its not some album copied online... I'm very disappointed."
1,Didn't like it,"I know she was singing from the works of Erica Jong, but the songs have strong sexual content and language. Not what I expected after hearing ""Near The Black Forest"" on the W Hotel's CD."
5,Loved to death,"Do all little boys push things around and make ""vroom"" noises from their very early days--or just my little boy? My son has literally loved this book to death, and we are retiring the pieces of the first one to buy a second copy. Not that it isn't sturdy--it is. We have just read it so many times, it finally fell apart.My son just loves things with wheels that make noise. And, if they don't make the noise themselves, he will supply it for them. This has nice illustrations to accompany the rhyming text and the action of the pages holds interest. Kids can easily pick out things they recognize. Comes with suggestions for learning activities on the back cover."
3,This book covers squadron histories more than actual crews,This book has some stories about bomber crews but not as many as I would like.
5,Best Point and shot camera,I bought this camera before leaving for my vacation to Switzerland. I made the decision to buy this one after reading the reviews on Amazon. And I like to thank all the people who help me to decide by writing there reviews. All my pictures came out excellent. Its hard to tell the diffrence between a picture taken from an SLR & by this point and shot camera. I will highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a point and shoot camera for excellent results.
2,Shakey Images,"No complaints about the quality of the lens nor reliability of the camera. The problem is with the final product, few crisp clear pictures.I've had a Rollei compact for years. It produced great pictures but was bulkier than the Stylus Epic. After switching, I noticed that more of my pictures were blurry. I suspect it is due to the small size relative to the shutter release button. Seems like I need to use a tripod which makes the camera less portable. :O"
1,no better than a disposable,"I am very disappointed in this camera. I see absolutely no difference in it from the disposables you pick up at the grocery store, except maybe the color of the unit. Everybody who sees it thinks it's a new gadget with all kinds of features and I always have to say, ""Nope... just a plain old plain old camera..."" I hope I get a digital camera for Christmas."
3,"great pictures, but unreliable","Because of the lens, pictures come out sharp and beautiful. I've even took slides.It's small and, so, it fits in your pocket. I take it kayakking.But I find it unreliable. I've owned three and each time around the 1 year mark, the camera would inadvertently rewind the film as I was opening the shell.I wish that there was a competitor. But there's really no other point and shoot with anything close to the sharpness that comes with an f2.8 lens."
5,Great pictures from such a small camera!,"When I get my pictures developed, people say, ""Wow, great photos! What kind of camera do you have?"" expecting me to pull out a big manual camera. When I show them my stylus epic, they say, ""It's so small!"" I have taken it on trips and picnics, to fancy balls and award ceremonies, and it hasn't weighed me down or bulged in my purse. The red-eye reduction is great. Caveat: You would have to buy the zoom version to get shots closer than about 6-8 in.; this camera doesn't let you take the picture unless it's far enough from the subject. But it's great for someone who just wants to take really good pictures, and doesn't want to arry around a huge camera."
4,Buy it for the lens,"The Olympus Stylus Epic is ideal for lightweight travel photography, having numerous features serious photographers will appreciate: spot metering, shutter speeds to 1/1000, f/2.8 lens that focuses to 12 inches, and weather-resistant seals. The lens is amazing, better in fact than some SLR optics I have used. A few suggestions for getting the most out of your Stylus:1) This little camera weighs only about 5 ounces, so it is very important to hold it as steady as possible. I like to use a monopod when shooting scenics for maximum sharpness.2) Use the spot meter. I have noticed a tendency toward over-exposure in some situations, and with some very slow-speed (ASA 50) print films.3) The film advance is fairly noisy, so it is not recommended for candid photography.While the Stylus, like many compact cameras, does not offer manual focusing or exposure control, within its limitations it is a superb picture-taker. I carry mine with me all the time."
5,I'm a Japanese,"Small, light, and strong.The best for a tough traveling abroad.It has no Panorama Mode, no Wireless Remote Control, no Pouch, and no CR123A Battery.Then, it is simpler than Olympus [mju:]-II."
2,Camellion meets his match,"This time the DM is assigned to find and destroy a Red Chinese chemical weapons stash which will be used to takeover SE Asia. To help on the mission, he is matched with a CIA agent even more bigoted and opnionated than Camellion. Otherwise it's kill, kill, kill as in any other Death Merchant adventure. With a little bit of the usual asides on life, death and religion."
4,Solid,"It's stable but it only fits scopes of certain length, TAKE NOTE!. A little difficult to make minor adjustments. Paint scrapes off quite easily as well."
3,Cute content,"Nice book...I'm not a fan of organized religion...Despite the complete focus on religious nonsense, the stories were cute.It helped with my Animatronics work...MJL"
4,Praise from downunder,"Very enjoyable music indeed - good sounds. Have been told that their song ""Years from here"" is also good but it's not available in Australia."
2,Promising product marred by poor support,"Installation went relatively smoothly on a Dell Dimension 4100. Following a reboot, everything seemed to work ok except for the sound system. After spending a considerable amount of time searching for a solution to this problem, I sent a request for help to SUSE tech. support. My purchase came with a promise of 90 days of support for installation issues, but SUSE replied that this did not include help with configuration of sound cards. So far, I have been unable to resolve the problem. But I have decided that any company that weasles out of a technical support agreement is not a company I would welcome as software provider for my production network."
5,More of a question than a review,"I am considering buying Suse Linux Pro 9.3, but I am concerned whether or not it supports the Korn shell and the VI editor. I am trying to simulate my enviroment at work and make work a little easier. I work with HP UNIX running the KORN shell and the VI editor. Thanks in advance."
5,fun for boys,This puzzle is a great gift for teenage boys who like to sit around the table and chat. They love talking about the sports moments and like to have something to do while they are talking. Boys talk??? They sure do.
4,Nice :D,"It's nice but doesn't have an automatic on off sensor. Still, it's lovely and perfect for me. If you're looking for something you don't have to switch on and off this isn't the one for you, but if you don't mind that, then this is a beautiful night light with a good level of illumination."
3,Prophetic theory of the Great Pyramid,"I found this book to be an interesting read in theory, but found the details a little boring. If you're into a lot of numerolgy or like to add, subtract, multiply, and divide for the sheer enjoyment of it, you will like this book. Frankly, I thought this book could have been about half as long and I wouldn't have felt slighted. His implied theory of religious evolution seemed a bit lacking and I didn't care for his branding of Pauline doctrine as an inferior religion to Christ's teachings. As far as the prophetic themes, well, we'll just have to wait and see, but I won't be holding my breath. I guess I don't give Edgar Cayce, although interesting, the same kind of weight this author gives."
2,ordered but not needed,"Amazon said that I needed this adapter when I ordered the macro lens and tele lens for my Canon 510 but those came with an adapter, so this was a waste of money."
3,"Well, I suppose it meets its purpose...","Amazon is selling this product for $13.99. Thats quite a good price, but you still have to add shipping. If you buy it in a normal electronic shop you're going to pay around $20! $20 just for a piece of plastic that clips on to your camera!? Come on! Its not even a nice piece of plastic! They could've made it some sort of silver to match your camera! Well anyway, It does what its meant to do, and I suppose it does a good job with that. But still...."
1,Needs more internal padding because it made my foot bleed,"I was shopping around for a nice shoe for a little while, and I found this one at a great store called Soccer Plus in Palatine, IL. I bought the shoe and used it to kick a ball around with some friends. By the end, the back of my ankle had a mark from the friction. Next time I used it, I ran on a treadmill. When I finished and looked at my sock, it was covered in blood from that same area. I'm not sure what the problem was, but I think it was the artificial material and the lack of padding. I wouldn't really recommend this shoe. Find one with better padding inside."
4,Moe Doodle Costume,"After spending a lot of money at Doodlebops live in September, my son really wanted to be Moe Doodle for Halloween. Of course, they only sell it online. Although the price is not cheap, I find the costume to be worth it. The wig is surprisingly good. It fits perfectly on my child's head, which he surprisingly kept on the entire Halloween night. There was no incident of the wig falling off.My only gripe is the gloves. It's very oversized compared to the rest of the costume. My son wanted to wear it even though he had a hard time holding his bag of treats.I give this product 4 stars, minus 1 for the oversized gloves."
3,Great photography,"Nice book, great photos. Not much in the way of recipes. Mostly for ingredients I can't get. I'll keep it for an inspiration book, though."
2,Not that great of a camera : it's my second Olympus,the AA batteries go out with one roll on average.. this is such a disadvantage...i also have an Olympus Stylus 70 mm and it takes much better pictures...it is clearear by a longshot... don't invest in this camera ... pay up a little for picutres you'll treasure for a lifetime..
3,Ok for beginners,This product is of moderate capabilities. It's a comfortable fit for beginners and intermediates alike. I wouldn't recommend using this camera for other purposed than pictures on vacation.
2,"Good book, but...","...contains several typos (and Nautical Almanac pages referenced in some of the problems are missing). Instead of this one, get the updated (2006) version - it also has color illustrations while this one only has them in black & white.[Later addition]: Or even better, get Ocean Sailing (same author), which includes the material from the (corrected) 2006 edition plus additional topics on ocean weather and passage-making.Ocean Sailing"
2,Agatha Christie failed to inspire,"Trying her hand at writing into occultism and supernatural subjects, Agatha Christie failed to provoke new insights nor deliver any entertainment value.Several stories were outrightly occultic, such as the Hound of Death. These have got nothing to do with crimes.A couple of other stories such as the Blue Jar have some crime involved, and could be considered readable.What mystery and crime readers would normally expect from Agatha Christie was a thorough investigation of the paranormal, sifting the clues and evidence, and exhaust all possibilities before leaving it as ... unexplainable by known facts. Had Agatha Christie done that, the stories would have been much much more readable."
3,The Hound of Death,The short stories are mostly fantasy rather than mystery. I bit disappointed if you are expecting the classic Agatha Christic fictions.And the stories are too short and fragmented.
5,A VERY GOOD MOVIE,"I watched this movie a long time ago so I do not remember excatly what I thought about it - I just remember I really loved it, and if I will just get my father's premission to use his credit card... I'll buy it as soon as I can.Besides, it was the first Ethan Hawke movie I saw - and ever since then I've seen more movies of him and he's my favorite actor now. You can say Winona Ryder is one of my favorite actresses too - I just love her!"
1,"""Singles"" remake, but without any new insights.","This unoriginal knock-off of Singles (1992) glorifies losers who find no purpose in their life, and make little effort to find it. The whole camera-in-the-face-of-virgins-of-the-real-world idea, first seen in Singles, has so much more potential than realized in this film, which has our chain-smoking heroine chosing between two equally unworthy suitors, a stereotypical business-suit Jewish yuppie with no life, and an equally stereotypical artistic drifter with no ambition."
1,Stinker!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I couldn't even stand to watch it all. I think the most spot-on review for this film is the one entitled ""Stereotyped Bid For Hipness"" further down this list of reviews. I couldn't have said it better.The characters are so self-consciously 'cool' that they end up coming across as being hideously uncool. All the characters are so unlikeable and immature that it is difficult to care what happens to them. Normally I like these actors but they are drowning here."
5,Reality Does Bite!!,"What none of the other reviewers have expressed is the fact that this movie is so much more than just Lanie's love triangle. It's not ""just another twenty-something's movie"". The makers of this film lead us into the family lives of our new friends. We see why they are so confused. It also shows the audience that there are those of us out there who have college degrees and don't know what the hell to do after we take off the cap and gown. It is by far one of my all time favorites."
4,Not stereotypical...,"I didn't find this movie stereotypical at all, unlike some of the other posters here. I thought that the dialogue was great, not to the level of Tarantino or Smith, but still very quick and some very good one liners, most of them coming from Ethan Hawke. I liked the relationship between Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke, and one of my favorite scenes ever is when he confesses his love to her at the end of the movie. Janene Garafolo's scenes at the Gap are priceless, especially when she's folding the shirts. This is a really funny movie, and I would definitely recommend it."
2,"Brilliant Actings, Predictable Story!","I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV!By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy!"
3,A Little Painful but Unintentionally Funny,"What a bunch of immature, spoiled, boring, dumb and shallow characters, played by immature, spoiled, boring, dumb and shallow actors (Janeane Garofalo, Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, etc.)! As a twenty-something in New York during the nineties I can remember that there were plenty of people like these around and it's sad but also very funny to see them in this time capsule movie. Incredibly dated, but if you were a young white person living in an urban setting during the time of this movie you will laugh and wince with recognition. By the way, Winona Ryder might be a complete dimwit in real life but she sure was nice to look at in this movie--try watching with the sound turned down and she looks even better."
1,Waste of Time,"If you like movies about self-indulgant young adults, enjoy. As far as I'm concerned, this film had no redeeming value and sent the wrong message to young viewers."
2,JUST A WHINING MESS,"ben Stiller who was so hilarious in Something About Mary directed this generation X(?) film about love in the 90's and existence without meaning and all that hoosa-fudge. These teeny Bopper movies about finding love without caring about anything really piss me off. You wanna see a good teen film? go see KIDS, its more realistic, more substancial and funny as hell sometimes. Winona Ryder you are so damn annoying in this movie I cant believe it. Ethan Hawke delivered some great lines but never really made up his mind of what the hell he really believed in. Sorry but this is not as good a film as all these reviewers say it is. see KIDS, thats a great great great film."
1,Talk about Shallow and Hollow,"This movie like its title BITES. This movie is nothing more than self absorbed people who have no bloody idea of what they want out of life. I use to be a big fan of Ryder back in the early 90's, mind you I was only 12 years old when this movie came out in 1994, but her character as the whiny Lelaina (whatever her name was) was enough for me to start disliking her movie choices. I Liked her in ""Little Women"" but after this movie I pretty much lost interest in her work. Ethan Hawke is a pretty good actor but I wanted to punch him in the face in this movie and Winona Ryder was just to self-absorbed, selfish and whinny for my taste. Plenty of people love this movie, I don't."
1,"Unfunny, unlikable idiots behave as you expect","The script stunk, and the ending was worse. nuff said"
3,Good enough,"Not an award winner, but mildly enjoyable. Watched for Free on Prime and streamed to our TV with our Roku. Was worth our time; no regrets."
2,couldn't get through it,"The cast list on this film looked pretty impressive, so I decided to give it a try on Netflix. I could barely get through it. It was slow not in a way that developed characters but rather that seemed focused on playing around with ""original"" camera techniques, such as watching people slouch around through the lens of a VHS video camera. Not worth sitting through - I quickly changed the movie after about half an hour."
5,Will leave you smiling.,"Reality Bites definitely surprised me with it's quality. I was expecting it to be a half-assed 1990's Breakfast Club but I was pleasantly proven wrong. The talented actors and actresses definitely make this movie worth watching. If you want to watch a movie that will leave you with this silly grin on your face and an improved outlook on life, take some time and watch this gem. 5 stars."
3,great film,This movie reminds me of my senior year in high school!! I was looking forward to graduating high school and heading off to were these guys in the movie had just graduated from...college!! It's cool to see all these actors so young and especially ben stiller!! Wynona ryder is at her hottest..so is Ethan hawke...The only thing missing is this movie could have used a stronger soundtrack that u could identify with the movie!!
4,Gen X revisited,"The 90's, in retrospect, were a wonderful time. Oh, the flannel, the Starbucks, the grunge, and Kennedy from MtV. So much great music! If you're a Gen X'er longing for those glory days and remembering all those aspects, ""REALITY BITES"" is one of those films that will take you back. Forget about how fast we're getting old by wasting 90 minutes with this loveable cast. In fact, make it a 90's memory-lane triple header by watching ""SINGLES"" and ""CLERKS"" as well!"
3,Little bit of nostalgia for the Gen Xers!,This movie is a bit of history now for Gen Xer's that have moved on in life.
3,good acting all around.. disappointing ending,"A young woman has a choice between two cute twenty-something losers: a childish, damaged, hipster musician slacker who's afraid of emotional commitment; and a ""yuppie"" who doesn't quite understand her high ideals, but has more of an understanding of human nature and emotion. Which loser will she choose? I'm sure the suspense is killing you, but in the meantime you can count how many 70's pop-culture references you can catch.Watching a bunch of young adults blundering around, trying to live their lives the best they know how may be realistic, but I'm not sure it's terribly rewarding or entertaining. Reality bites, indeed."
3,So much potential!,"This movie could have been really great. But, it just ended up being mediocre at best.It's very stereotypical and predictable in it's portrayal of a bunch of twentysomethings living in an apartment together in the grunge era of the 90's.Winona Ryder plays Lelaina Pierce, a freshly graduated college valedictorian who finds it impossible to find a job - or to choose between the two guys in her life (Ethan Hawke, Ben Stiller).It's really just a grunged out version of boy (ethan hawke) loves girl (winona ryder) but is too afraid to tell her, so girl goes off with another boy (ben stiller) and boy confesses his love to her, afraid that he will lose her forever - and now she must choose.It's not a horrible film. But it's nothing great either. If nothing else, it's a good keepsake of the grunge movement of the early nineties."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A depressingly formulaic and unappealing movie in which the main character must decide romantically between a suit-wearing bigshot and a soulful poet-writing ne'er do well (guess which one she chooses), Reality Bites should be of interest only to those who want to steep themselves in mid-90's nostalgia."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"The VGA part of the splitter deos pass the VGA signal through. However, there is no signal coming out of the DVI part. I tested it on two computer with the same results. The item DOES NOT WORK.I sent a RMA request to the company which sold the item through Amazon but I never received a response."
4,Hamill never disappoints,A friend introduced me to this great story teller and Mr. Hamill will now be a favorite forever. His work is autobiographical but in no way self indulgent. A most enjoyable read.
4,WOW! what a picture,"I got this as a gift and I have to say that it is amazing. I didn't even really need to look at the directions, VERY EASY! This camera ia very light, and compact and can fit into also anything, even a small tiny purse! It figures 6 different flash types so you can cut out on ""devil eyes"" and lack of background in the night shots. Very nice! And if you take pictures like me and have your fingers in front of the lens, there's almost no way to do this with this camera. Another plus in my book!This camera is great!"
3,not amazing,"i'll be honest, i haven't listened to this album in like 2 years, but i do know it's probably my least favorite work by him. it's a follw-up to an album he did in 1994 called aftersolstice, which is quite remarkable. this however, is not. i remember putting it on after i got it and it took about 5 minutes before i could even hear a sound. then a bleak drone built up for about 2 minutes, and just when it sounded like it was getting going, it stopped. then it was silent for the next 10 minutes or thereabouts.in all there are about 5 sounds on this disk. i respect minimalism n' all, but this is rediculous. i think he overedited, is all. i'm sure he was just going for a certain feel, and i just don't want to be patient and wait for the 5 3-minute blurbs of interesting sound that come in about every 10-15 minutes. oh well."
3,Bill's 2nd Career Off To Great Start,"Everyone thought he was nuts for leaving the Stones, but Bill shows that there is more to life than being a Stone. Thankfully, Bill's original compositions are few - he learned his lesson with the solo albums he released during his tenure with the Stones. Instead, Bill fills this disc with old blues, jazz, and rhythm & blues numbers performed by a collection of crack musicians. Bill sings a few tunes (unfortunately) but they're tolerable. The disc makes one ready for the next two in the planned trilogy."
4,a long awaited breather!,this album is just what the music industry needs. It breaks free of the traditional punk and doesn't dwell on anger. It is a classic in the making.
5,Bought This Season As A Present,"I bought this show for my mother, she absoutely loves this show, but she is a big fan of Sally Fields. I would recommend this show to everyone."
4,Brothers and Sisters.,Great series. Terrific actors. A series I enjoyed from start to finish. Would recommend to anyone who likes too get involved in series.
1,Brothers and sisters,I have not received this item yet and was wondering where it was. Im very disapointed as I alway receive them on time please send this asap
2,"Used yes, like new not so much","Disc one had something spilled on it and skipped and pixilated until I washed it. This final season discs display episodes differently, only showing three to choose from - you have to select 'next' to find the last two. I thought they had been omitted somehow."
3,LOVE the show...BUMMED by the ending,"With such great momentum coming off Season 4, I was really disappointed by Season 5. Half the characters are gone or only show up rarely, and I felt like the show just lost its zest. I still enjoyed watching this season, but not as much as the ones before it."
4,the record is great! is james as usual.,"Ok. The record is great. But we can simply keep the focus on two marvellous songs: Just Like Fred Astaire and We're Going To Miss You. The fisrt is one the most beautiful vocals by Booth ever,its beauty is touching (""just met a girl who believes we can fly!), and the second is a great beat and a chorus that sends shivers down the spine. The rest is bonus track (wonderful bonus, of course)."
3,"This ain't SEVEN or LAID, but it will get ya through.","It'll take a little bit of time to get used to this one, but I wouldn't say it's their best. It's a different James than the one I grew up with in Seven, Laid, etc. It's almost like trying to get used to ""Wah Wah"" with a differernt twist, listening and listening over and and over agian 'til you kinda figure out there's two songs you like. I started out this way on Millionaires, but eventually got llulabyed into songs like ""hello"" and ""afro lovers"". Sinead O'Connor ""appears"" on this album as well, but she might as well not have been on here since she only sings once at the end of the album.If this is your first James album go listen to Seven or Laid. If you're an avid James fan, it's something to tide you over until something new comes out."
3,Pride of Punahele,I have been enjoying the music of Keali'i Reichel since 1996. His fabulous voice has been well recorded and his discs have good sound. I was disappointed in this compilation disc because the sound quality of the non-Reichel recordings was poor.
5,"Beautiful, and well made","I bought this six months ago, and I'm still impressed with the quality. The chimes are pretty loud, but they can be turned down. It keeps perfect time, and has a nice quality look & feel to it."
5,I Love This Clock!!!!,"We received this clock as a house warming gift when we bought our new home. Very nice clock for the price! The chimes sound awesome and you can hear them all through the house. This clock is very handsome and looks beautiful on the wall. I absolutely love it and wouldn't trade it for the world. When we first put it up, the whole family gathered together just before the hour to hear the chimes. Reminds me of being at my rich aunts house!!!!!!"
3,Great Product,"I actually bought this phone for someone else. I never used it myself, however the person never complained about it. I bought one in the past from another seler for my mom thou, it worked well for about 6mths then the screen blanked out! because the flex cable was damaged, however she had it repaired for $300TT.p.s AVIOD FLIPPING THE PHONE UP AND DOWN UNNECESSARILY!!! BECAUSE ITS A FLIP PHONE THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT OUGHT TO BE FLIPPED CONSTANTLY!!! DOING SO CAN COST YOU ANOTHER PHONE."
3,Nice phone,"I purchased this phone for use with my current cell phone service. The phone was very nice, however, my cell phone provider told me that I could not use this phone with their service since I didn't purchase it from them. When I inserted my SIM card, it said ""Inactive SIM card"". I had to return the phone and purchase it from my provider. That being said, the phone works very nicely and has a lot of nice features, however, the one thing I don't like is the short battery life. I don't use my phone all that much, but I need to charge it every night if I am going to use it the next day."
4,A nostalgic view of rural America,"A hi fidelity picture of a culture few would really know about except by name. Definitely a feel-good story, about gentle looking-for-love-and-finding-it.I loved the nostalgic details of post World War 2 rural Pennsylvania, including the mouth-watering detail of the cooking. An America that alas hardly exists any more, except perhaps in the Amish communities, which this one wasn't. The one jarring detail: so many names beginning with R: Ronald Ray, then Regan, Ricky, Ruby, Rosa and Randy."
4,Metaaaaaaalllllll!!!,"I used to have the cassette tape back in 1989. I let someone borrow it and haven't seen it since. Now I finally get a chance to have it back! The album is great, hyper, obnoxious fun that reminds me of the good old days."
4,classic thrash,"This band may not have achieved the same status as Anthrax, Slayer, or Megadeth, but this album ranks right up there with many of aforementioned bands' classic releases of '80s and early '90s. I still love this album 20 years later!"
2,A miss,"Well the first two tracks on this CD are really good. But as you listen to the whole album you find that the songs are just eh. They try too hard to sound like old school Slayer. I can't really say this is innovative as they sound like a cooky version of Slayer (vocal wise). But if you can just listen to the intro ""The Last Remains"" and ""Hunted, Stalked, and Slain"" - the best two songs on the whole cd. I give them credit as they really tried to be an East Coast Slayer. nothing special..."
3,Cigar By Remy Latour for Men,"used cigar years ago and liked it, but this time it smells little stronger. but can't complain i think it worth the price."
5,Love it!,"Just a great one, i was looking at this one for long time and finally found it here...but it doesn't last long"
3,Good rug. A little lightweight.,"I was having issues finding a rug that would serve as a good weather mat for the entry way to my office that didn't cost a lot of money. I eventually came across this rug and was surprised to find that it had all the features I was looking for at a very reasonable price. However, once I received it I noticed that it was not without its flaws. Although the product does have a rubber backing, the rug is very lightweight. The rug constantly slides on the carpeting in our office and is always having to be readjusted as to prevent it from folding over on itself and causing a tripping hazard.I would recommend the rug, but only for low traffic areas where it isn't a concern if the rug slides or moves out of place."
3,"Great collection, but not meditations by a long stretch","The Nimbus label produced reliably good recordings throught the eighties, in the early days of digital recording. William Boughton and the English String Orchestra turned in some of the most beautiful recordings of modern English classical music on record, and their version of Aaron Copland's Appalachian Spring proves those sensitivities don't just extend to Anglo composers. If that were the only piece on this CD it would be worth the asking price. The Hanover Band's excerpt of Beethoven's Sixth symphony is played beautifully. Total running time on this set is about seventy minutes.My one complaint is these pieces don't even come close to the kind of music choices one would associate with meditiation. Overture to Smetana's Bartered Bride? First movement to the Italian Symphony? The other discs in this set get at least four stars from me. But this set should have been labeled ""Boogeying into Spring with the Classics."""
5,Really Cute Pooh,"I ordered this for my wife who is a pooh nut. This is her 3rd Pooh watch. She said it is just the right size. It isn't as large as it looks in the picture, but it is very cute. Nice price but shipping was slow."
2,Winnie the Pooh Watch,"The watch is okay, but the mother of pearl lacks luster and color. Disappointing."
1,This biography is more fiction than truth,"Shulman's ""biography"" of Valentino is certainly more fiction than truth. It's an interesting read if you're looking for the flavor of the 1920s, but other than that, forget it. It is equally as florid as his ""biography"" of Jean Harlow. Does he make this stuff up as he goes along?"
3,Valentino,"Valentino's movies and life are fascinating. By the time I read this book I knew pretty much how his life went. I like medical stuff, and I kept looking for a book that would explain in medical terms his final illness."
5,Fantastic!!!,"This outstanding biography of Valentino, which I've read twice, is extremely well-written, entertaining, and insightful. Shulman's thorough and well-organized reporting, keen observations, and critical commentary on the film industry and American culture make this compelling reading. The biography begins with Valentino's dramatic funeral in New York in August 1926, then moves back to Rudolph's birth and life in Castellaneta, Italy. Shulman then narrates the fascinating odyssey of Valentino's struggle to succeed in America, his rise to stardom, his two failed marriages, his (and second wife Natacha Rambova's) occult beliefs and practices, his death, and his posthumous deification as a love god. Shulman appreciates and sympathizes with Valentino, but does so in a manner that is neither lachrymose nor condescending. A terrific read!!!"
3,Paul Weller,"This album reintroduces former Style Council leader Paul Weller, with some great songs.""Remember how we started"" sounds much better on Live Wood, but enjoy it here too.After recovering from The Style Council's career end (at the hands of fans and Polydor alike), Paul emerges to commence a solo career lasting longer than either of his previous bands."
3,"Not his best, but great songs","My only problem with this album is that he did everything himself. Understandibly since he couldn't get a deal until he took the tapes to Japan for Pony Canyon to release, he had to do all the instruments and recording himself. But that leaves a certain lacking in the sound. All overdubs has left wonderful songs sounding, well, flat really. Certainly a disappointing album if you had happened to see his tour to promote it, when he was so full of fire and energy, excited to be out in front of an audience again, and the songs were new and exciting and the whole band played with all their heart."
3,Complex but fun. Thank goodness for the pause button,"If you like the era, and if you like micromanaging as you build an empire (here, a business and crime empire), this is a fun game. The strong points include nearly infinite replayability, its nice mix of strategy (mixing legal and illegal businesses) and tactics (arranging and responding to street ambushes and hits), and the amusing grace notes -- like bribing police, intimidating jurors, and torching rival speakeasies The designers went to great lengths to give the gamer many choices, both strategic (there are three ways to win) and tactical. The game's drawbacks include the steep learning curve, a rather cumbersome interface, and the difficulties of keeping track of multiple events happening all over the map; the pause button helps here, but if you try to keep on top of everything, each game turn (one week) can become long and tedious. This is definitely for your more cerebral moods, not when you want a beer-and-pretzel quick and easy game."
4,Great Game,This is the best gangster game I have ever seen! The only reason it is not a five star is the fact that it is hard to get started with. But once you get the hang of it is easy! With scenerios and long game it ranks the best game i have! For additional help get the Prima Strategy Guide.
1,Absoultly Stinks!,"I did not like this game at all. The instuction manual is like the size of a phone book, what is that? The graphics stink, music stinks, I think it is the worst Eidos ever made."
5,Very nice,This game is a very good game. It has many way to approch it so it never becomes boring. Much better then it's sequal Gangsters 2. It is not easy though but not impossible. I enjoyed this game very much and I recommend this game to anyone who likes sim games.
2,"Stupid, but funny","""Hooray for Boobies"" is one of the stupidest cd's I have ever heard, but it is also one of the funniest. With songs like ""10 best things about n.j."" (10 sec. of silence) and ""A Lap dance is so much better when the stripper is crying"", it certainly follows up one fierce beer coaster with another stupid comedy album. If you're into stupid comedy, buy the album, but beware: it's very offensive (it even has a ""Warning: extremely offensive lyrics"" sticker on it). If you're into real music, don't get this cd. It's not worth it. I only gave it 2 stars because it's funny, not because the music's good."
2,"""Hooray For Boobies"" doesn't have me shouting for joy.","""The Bad Touch"" is a funny song. Hats off to Jim for coming up with some great catchy lyrics, and a tune that keeps it real. But, is that all that their new album, ""Hooray For Boobies"" has to offer? Sadly, yes. After a few cool tunes like ""Mope"" and ""Hell Yeah"", the album relys on its shock value of Bad Touch to carry through the rest of the album and deliver energy to such desperate songs like A Lapdance Is So Much Better When The Stripper Is Crying, that steals from country, badly, and loses its charm fast. It seemed like an entire CD of garnish, and no real substance, no meat. It felt rushed and choppy, with inane skits in the middle that aren't that funny, despite a chuckle-worthy phone conversation with one of the mothers about vaginas. If you want talented, shock worthy songs that have good flow, and catchy beats, stick with Eminem, and Dr. Dre. The Bloodhound Gang have talent, they just didn't show it with this one."
5,one awesome CD,"I just picked up this disc, and it's awesome! It's kinda like a cross between Limp Bizkit and blink-182, but the BHG have a sound all their own. Many of the songs are really explicit but that's aight. My fave songs are ""Mope,"" ""I Hope You Die,"" ""...White Dope,"" and ""Hell Yeah."" I mean, all of the tunes rock. Some are kinda hardcore, but a lot of it's just silly and kinda gross. They really do have talent. Don't let anybody tell you different! :)"
4,Hooray For Boobies Delayed,"actually, the record will not be out on 9-28 futhermore, the release will be sometime in January or February of 2000...some minor details still need to be ironed out in terms of samples, etc...the record is quite funny...toilet humor again for sure, but it rocks as well as has some funny tracks once again"
4,Lighten up!,"Rock and roll is supposed to be fun. Sometimes that means a good hit of AC/DC, sometimes it means relaxing to Fleetwood Mac or Pink Floyd and yes sometimes it means getting a little warped. I am a 36 year old veteran of rock and have embraced this album for the pure fun it packs. Just try not to grin as you listen to this album. You will fail!"
2,Okay,"The song has a good beat, but bad lyrics. there are alot of artits like this who don't think about kids who might be listening."
2,YEAH! BUT NOT QUITE,THIS IS A REALLY KOOL ALBUM...THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES U LISTEN 2 IT. IT IS REALLY FUNNY BUT IT SOON GET'S OLD
1,This cd is for you if...,"1) You think the band LFO's lyrics are sophisticated2) You think Puff Daddy's samples are fresh and origional3) You laugh every time you hear the word boobiesSeriously, this may make you laugh every now and then, but it serves no purpose other than to make you laugh by it's stupidity. Not that there's anything wrong with that... But the lyrics are corny and the beat is oversampled and old, so as music goes, it get's low marks."
1,Think Twice Before Buying this Album!,"These are some lyrics from their song ""Yellow Fever""""..Cause I ride my slant-eyed slope like a brand new Kawasaki Oh me chinky she's so kinky got me hot like Nagasaki Burnin' up like Napalm burstin' like an A-bomb.."" ""..I said I needed her to do and her to do my laundry I knew she needed a way to stay legally within the country..."" ""...She's like an oriental rug cause I lay her where I please Then I blindfold her with dental floss and get down on her knees....""...""Like the Chinese New Year she's gonna see fireworks Now be a good chinky and press Jimmy's shirts..."" ""Chinky chinky bang bang chinky bang Chinky chinky bang biddily biddily biddily bang""written by the Bloodhound Gang. Need I say more? No, need they say more?"
4,what the hell does sophmoric mean?,"this album is a laugh. Don't think your getting decent music here, all you get are a bunch of so songs written to be humorous, to any beat. these guys are great. if you want to be entertained, this album is the entertainer."
5,LOL!,"the bad touch is so funny and so is mama's boy. aw screw the "" explicit lyrics "" this is great for a three year old ( actually not really at all) but anyone who likes adam sandler's stuff then u will like this! so go and buy it now!'"
5,This Cd is great.,"I got this Cd the other day and I wasn't sure I was going to like them........but I do. I am really one for sick humor and these guys are holarious!!! My favorite songs on this Cd are: Mope and The ballad of Chasey Lain.If you don't get eaisly offended, than u might be able to handle these guys."
4,Bloodhound Gang - Hooray For Boobies,"This is one of favourite albums out at the moment. ""I hope you die"" is the opening track, and it really blow you away. Hard beats which will invariably have you tapping your feet. This is another album which is packed full of humour, and will have you singing all day.My favourite tracks are ""I hope you die"", ""Yummy Down On This"", ""The Ballad Of Chasey Lain"" and of course, the now famous ""The Bad Touch"". I definitely recommend this album if you like heavy beats, funny lyrics and catchy tunes. A word of warning though, don't buy this if you only like pop."
4,OHHHHHHHHH YEAAAAAAAAAAA,"this cd is frickin funny and should be owned by everyone, no matter the age. when i listen to it, i bust out laughin, especially at the pac-man part. if anybody says otherwise, they have had no brain"
2,disgusting,"this cd is completely filthy and only good if you have absolutely no morals. Some of it is funny, but most of it is completely disgusting. These guys are terrible."
1,"unfortunately, zero stars is not an option","how can you possibly call this music? if you are 12 years old and you laugh histerically everytime you hear the word ""fart"", then i strongly recommend this cd."
3,IT'S FUNNY BUT SO WHAT,"THESE GUYS ARE SO IRRELEVANT THAT I FEEL LIKE I WANT THIS TWO MINUTES OF MY LIFE BACK. WEIRD AL IS BETTER, FUNNIER, AND OH YEA HE WAS DOING THIS LONG BEFORE THESE HACKS CAME INTO THE PICTURE. THEIR LIKE THE JERKY BOYS IF THEY WERE METH HEADS."
2,pass on this one,"My all time favorite bloodhoung song was ""Fire Water Burn"". I was hoping there would be more ""masterpieces"" like this one, but much to my disappointment, this cd has NO songs worth listening to. Simply stated, I wish I could return it."
4,yay for hooray,"So much fun, oh so catchy, and very funny...I love this album, there are some terrible tracks and terrible jokes, but overall it rocks pretty hard.""I Hope You Die"" is as catchy as punk-pop gets these days, and the lyrics are pretty clever I suppose (...)""The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope"" is fun to learn the words and rap along to.""Three Point One Four"" is a CLASSIC!""Mope"" is great to listen to on crack.""Yummy Down On This"" a terrible song about oral sex. Oh dear..""The Ballad Of Chasey Lain"" excellent, obviously single material.""Right Turn Clyde"" one of my favourites, has a sick beat, nice stoner rock.""A Lap Dance Is So Much Better When The Stripper Is Crying"" dont like this one...This is just stoner rock. Or 12-year-old rock. Or guys in their 30s finding it hilarious. It's great though, worth stealing."
4,Calm Down!,"Anyone who finds this CD to be vulger or offensive needs to calm down. We live in a society that thrives on vulgarity. We listen to Howard Stern, we watch Tom Green and WWF. These things are not to be taken seriously and neither is the Bloodhound Gang. As an owner of all three of their CDs I must say this album is not as good as One Fierce Beercoaster, however, it does deserve its own respect. It combines a mix of humor and great music to create a CD that is hard to put into one category. I will say this much, if you are a sensitive person beware of the Lap dance song, it can be upsetting. Otherwise sit back and enjoy!"
4,what the hell does sophmoric mean?,"this album is a laugh. Don't think your getting decent music here, all you get are a bunch of somngs written to be humorous, to any beat. these guys are great. if you want to be entertained, this album is the entertainer."
3,Hum.....,"Well, they are funny i'll give them that! Honestly, they are very funny. I guess i can see how some people may find it offensive, but the name sais it all, just dont listen to it! Personally, i HATE ""Bad Touch"". I think its just really really stupid. Alot of the songs are stupid and have no meaning, except for maybe turning some poor desperate person on. ""I hope you die"" is an awesome song, I think its the best on the CD, I just wish more songs would have had meaning like that one. There is one thing that bugs me though. I find the album very hypocritical because they proberly never even been close to experiencing half the stuff they sing about!(Admit it, most of them are NASTY)"
3,Good Humor. Decent Music.,"The Bloodhound Gang use toilet humor here to make this a very very very funny CD. The music is average though, no really hard stuff to play. Using Pac-Man samples is one of the most unique things i've ever heard on an album, though. My favorite songs on this album are: ""I Hope You Die"", ""Three Point One Four"", ""Mope"", ""The Bad Touch"", ""Right Turn Clyde"", and of course ""A Lap Dance is so much Better when the Stripper is Crying"". These songs make me laugh, but they make me feel guilty for laughing. It's a fairly decent CD. If you are looking for music, this isn't that good of a selection. If you are looking for humor, buy it as soon as possible."
5,FUNNY!,"This CD is the funniest CD I have. Bloodhound Gang can be funny without using the violience like Eminem does. This CD is very rude and is very offenmding (not to me). If you get offended easily, don't buy this CD, but if you're looking for tons of laughs buy it!"
3,"Ok, but not Great",I was really expecting a poster that would draw the attention when I entered my room. This small poster fails because it really is smaller than described. The text on the upper right hand side is too small to read and the poster itself feels pretty cheap.
3,looks blurry,"I'm not sure if the poster is supposed to be this way or what, but it looks like it was printed from a low res picture that was enlarged. The image doesn't seem that clear and the colors are kind of off. The poster came in good condition though and was packaged well."
4,Waylon's MacArthur Park,"I confess...the real reason I purchased this CD was for Waylon's version of MacArthur Park, one of the most melancholy covers I've ever heard. Saying that, I was also pleased with the true country of the rest of the album. This will never replace the live Waylon albums but you get some of his really good songs...Are You Ready For The Country, Can't You See, A Couple More Years, etc. The live albums, especially with Willie, will always have top spot in my collection, however, MacArthur Park will assure this gets played often. And NO, it doesn't always make sense, but go to lyrics.com and print out the lyrics to sing along with the song and if you have a tender place in your heart, this will move you, almost to tears."
4,Vintage country,"Waylon Jennings does it again with a classic album of good country music. The voice is there, and the emotion that goes with it. I bought the album after hearing his version of ""Can't You See"" on the radio. That's a great track, but there isn't a bad one on this album. Waylon's voice sounds like gigs in smoky bars, knocking back a few beers between sets. It also reminds me of good times at concerts in the '70s. Waylon may be gone, but his music lives on!"
2,CRUCIBLE OF TERROR,"The movie supposedly got an X rating on it release, but it should be rated pg 13 it has no nudity few killing with little gore. Besides that the movie moves real slow and it has no erotic feel to it. I rate it two stars because the acting was descent but not good enought to save this movie it's not worth buying."
2,Why did I buy this?,"No, I'm serious - I can't remember. I'm interested in certain kinds of horror films (Universal through to Hammer), but they either have to have some good qualities, or be so thoroughly bad that they become collectable for their brazen cheek or tongue-in-cheek self awareness. This film has neither, it's just a somewhat boring not very good British genre horror pic. The plot makes no sense, much of the acting is just plain amateurish (but not bad enough to be enjoyable) and the whole thing seems completely pointless. The DVD transfer seems fine, but - why bother? [2 stars, because it's not good enough to get 1 star!]"
4,fun to read,"Hard to find picture books that are fun to read over and over, but this series, like the Mercer Meyer frog books, is a good repeat."
2,C-,"In an ironic twist, the title is sadly misleading. In a group of essays that seem to exist mostly as filler, Degeneres, who is usually so funny in her stand-up routines, absolutely misses the target on her first humor collection. There isn't a single essay that is good all the way through. There is a running gag about club soda that is amusing, and a chapter on human behavior is likewise entertaining. Degeneres rambles on in a way that is irritating, and many of her observations are strangely dull. Much of what the author has to say is a few beats off from funny, and the chapters containing lists are staggeringly dry and achingly boring. Reading through this was like reading a slightly silly textbook. Eyes passed over words, and while comprehending them, did not find them interesting. What a major disappointment from a talent who has proven herself to be a remarkable addition to the field of comedy, but who must have lost some of her humor in the translation from stage to the written word."
2,Ellen is much funnier in person,I didn't find this book very funny at all. I think Ellen Degeneres is so funny largely because of her delivery and just reading her words on a page just didn't cut it. I LOVE Ellen but I didn't love this book.
1,This book was awful.,"This book was complete and utter fluff. Degeneres does not in fact have a point. I felt dreadfully betrayed after reading this book, because I am a fan of her stand-up, but this book was pathetic. I really feel that Ellen has done her fans a disservice with this book, and I can only assume that some ruthless publicist forced her to write it."
5,"If you like Ellen, you'll love this book!","It's just so Ellen. You can hear her talk as your read her words on paper. It's very funny, and easy to read which sometimes is a pleasure in itself."
1,Stick to TV.,"I'm a die-hard fan of Ellen's TV series! Her sense of humor on the screen is unbeatable. In print, unfortunately, it's unbearable.A waste of your time and money."
1,My Book is BORING...and I Do Know It,"A disappointing read. Ms. DeGeneres' type of humor works brilliantly on TV, but comes off boring, dumb and predictable in print. I would rather see Ellen DeGeneres write a more serious autobiography, especially since she created such a stir when she outed herself and her show's character last year. Until she does that, don't waste your money on this book."
2,Pointless,"I, like all the past reviewers, love Ellen; however, this book is a bunch of pointless ramblings that I wish I didn't have to skip over to just get through the book. I haven't read her other books yet, since I'm wanting to read everything in time order when they were written.... so, I'm hoping that her other books are better than this one. I wouldn't even bother purchasing it, rather pointless!"
5,The perfect gift: laughter!,This book was purchased as a gift for a friend in need of some humor. To bottom-line this review: mission accomplished!!
5,Great Read!,This book was Ellen's first book and it proves she was funny from the very beginning. I highly recommend it.
3,This book was okay to read,"I believe that Ellen's humor is better live than on paper. I could laugh at her stand up for hours, but the book doesn't have the same effect. I did however laugh at the part about walking in on someone in the bathroom stall..."
2,my point,"really tried to read this book, just could not get into it. Not for me but it might be someone elses read"
5,"A funny, funny book.","I don't usually like books by comedians, they seem to be forced jokes. Ellen DeGeneres' book, however, was genuinely funny and charming. I read it a second time and actually enjoyed it again."
2,Talking in circles,"I love Ellen, but this book is soooo boring. All she does is talk in circles and nothing about her life-or her point"
1,Getting teeth pulled is more exciting,"This book is a quick read and that is just about the only good thing that I have to say about this book. I opened it expecting to laugh and learn something interesting about her life. What I have found instead is something not much more coherent than speaking to a three year old. The whole book consists of rambling, nonsense, incoherent stories that seem to make little if any sense. I seriously think that I lost a few brain cells while reading this book. If you start reading this and think oh it has to get better. I warn you it NEVER does! It's mindless drivle"
2,Disappointing and then some...,"I am one of the biggest Ellen fans out there, but this book was probably her worst job. I found it to be mostly her early stand-up routine put down on paper. And since Ellen is largely funny because of her comical looks, it left the humor hanging. Seriously, being an Ellen fan from the start, I would sit and tell the jokes before I read them off the page. If she was going to do a book about jokes, she should have at least come up with some new material. And she is blatantly honest about the financial motives of writing the book, and even ends the final page by writing random words so that she can meet her publisher's word quota because she has run out of funny material. All I can say is thank goodness I picked up my copy at a flea market for a buck and didn't pay a much too large price for a repeat of her show."
2,Waste of Money,As much as I enjoy Ellen and her show this book was really stupid and I read part of it and just threw it away.
2,Not very funny :(,"To me she's a great comedian...but to write a book and makes it funny is different. Several lines would have been funny if they were presented as a stand-up. I was going to give it 1 star, but considering throughout the book I got a few good laughs, and just smiling somewhere in between, I gave her 2. The title could have been My Point...And I do NOT Have One or My Point...And I do Have NONE (I know it's supposed to be funny in her original title, but it's not for me). Those chapters in the first half of the book are at least better than those in the second half. As the book moved on, I felt it got more and more dull. She was babbling too much, which was ok and very funny...when she did stand-ups; however, not in the book. Anyway I think she's better off presenting her jokes as an actress or stand-up comedian, but not as a writer."
5,This is a very funny book,"Ellen is in good form with this book. If you are looking for a life story then you will be dissapointed, but if you want to laugh then there is no better book out there (and I've read a lot).It is a tribute to one of the funniest comedians on the planet."
3,"""LOL""","I have to say this book was laugh-out-loud funny. But hey, its Ellen DeGeneres what do you expect? Well, I suppose it didn't actually meet my expectations. It was rather shallow and not meaty at all to say the least. It was kinda just a collection of jokes and wit. Nothing personal was in it at all. In fact it was the opposite of personal as you could tell that 99% of the stories in it were made up to be funny. She wasn't even out yet so there were some hetero-oriented references in there that seemed wholly out of place. But again it was hilarious because it was Ellen and she's funny. And it only took me one night to read it which was what I was looking for at the time having come off of a binge of actual memoirs with substance. So really if you're looking for something to keep your brain occupied this isn't for you at all. But if you love Ellen DeGeneres you'll like this."
3,"A good, light and easy read","I enjoyed this book as it was almost the same as listening to Ellen on her daily talk show which I Tivo every day. If you're looking for something intellectual or deep, don't get this one. However, if you want to read something light-hearted and funny like Ellen is, it's a good one!"
3,ok,"I read Ellen's latest book and loved it, so I thought I'd give this one a try. It reads like a stand-up act, and her humour isn't as polished yet... ok, but not great."
3,Back when she had a bit of edge left...,"Ellen's stand up was never the most compelling, but she was funny and would occasionally push the edges of safety a bit. This book still has a few remnants of that approach that has been suffocated by her entry into the safety of afternoon TV talk shows. As in many of these ""books"" by comics this is just a reflection of stand-up material expanded for the format and it is a nice reminder of when Ellen was funny. Some good set pieces for the book like journal entries and a ""Fantasy conversation with Ellen"" take advantage of the format well and there are a number of laughs here as you can easily put this in Ellen's voice. I'm not really sure she has ""a point"" per se, but this is an amusing if slight book."
1,There is no point . . .,. . . there never was one . . . and never will be . . . the book is totally pointless . . . I have deleted it from my Kindle
1,Greg,"After listening to Helen DeGeneres faked croc tears over her dog, she entered the ranks of the 'best forgotten'."
1,Don't bother.,"This was the worst book I've ever read. Not only is it a near copy of her stand-up comedy, but she fills the book with excerpts of how difficult it is to write a book and ends by randomly naming things in the room she's in. It was a sad disappoinment from one of my favorite comediennes and was not worth the two dollars I spent on it at a flea market."
3,Ellen Degeneres is a comedian-in fifth grade humor.,"Yes, Ellen Degeneres is a very funny lady. But no, her book is not. Although, My Point And I Do Have One was her second, the write has not improved. I personally do watch her show and enjoy every moment, but as far as her book-I was not impressed. I do, however, plan to read more of her books in the future. I hope the prove her comic ability as how I see on television."
2,Disappointing,"I think Ellen is a wonderful comedian and talk show host but, this book fell short of my expectations. It was more a collection of ramblings as opposed to a good read."
1,"OMG, I love Ellen but man did I hate this book.","Sorry folks, I couldn't stand this book. I couldn't get through it, had to stop reading it. It's really terrible. It's completely turned me off of even checking out anything she writes. Nevertheless, Ellen on TV is fine. She's terrific. But this book is terrible."
5,"Giggles at 30,000 Feet","I'd been meaning to read this book ever since it first came out but it wasn't until I added it to my Kindle list for our latest cross-country trip that I could finally immerse myself in Ellen's unabashedly loopy, flippy and irreverent anecdotes. Whether she's talking about training her two dogs for the Iditarod on the pavements of LA or pondering why airline meats always display incongruous grill-marks, it's easy to see why she is one of America's favorite comics. The zippy way she flits from one topic to the next like a human hummingbird is matched only by the ongoing references to her angst about being able to meet her publishing contract's word-count. Anyone who has ever seen the musical ""You're a Good Man Charlie Brown"" will be mirthfully reminded of Lucy writing her book report about Peter Rabbit."
1,Didn't work for me at all...,"...But maybe that's just me. I was hoping to use this to cut some 4""x8""paver stones to fit along a curved walkway. Using a 16 oz. rubber hammer and this chisel, I pounded away at them, but I barely even managed to scratch them, much less cut them. I ended up using an angle grinder instead.Perhaps I was trying to use this chisel for something it wasn't intended to do. But either way, this was a waste of money for me."
5,Excelent,An exelente filter and an exelent peerformance for my Jeep Grand Cherokee 99.I have one for my Mercedes 260E 88 and work perfect with exelent performance.
2,"A ""Salalfi Tafsir"" would be a better description.","If you want a Salafi version of the Quran, this one is for you. I'm amazed at the misrepresentations in the version. One would be far better of with Muhammad Asad's version."
1,wrong product,"Amazon folks,I was buying this book for a friend and I thought it was in Spanish. Got the product in english so it is of no value to me.regards, ted"
4,Book wonderful- not as seller advertisd,"This book is the perfect complement to any wedding celebration. My husband and I pulled numerous quotes from various passages which were included in our wedding ceremony. I felt like our whole ceremony was far more intimate and personalized than it ever would have been without this book. My husband and I are very spiritual people who believe in God, but do not identify with any particular denomination. The book has a spiritual element but is not overly 'preachy'. There is something for everyone here. If you are not getting married, but simply have to give a speech...this book will either give you a ready-made speech/reading or provide inspiration/quotes to get you started. The only ding I am giving book is actually for the seller. Book was supposed to be ""like new"" but looked 'gently used' and had some dog eared pages."
5,"fast shipping, good product","Wow, this product shipped here faster than I thought. I ordered it right before the thanksgiving holida and it got here on saturday. I was expecting it next week. The capsules are great I have no complaints, it's clear so you can see inside."
4,Interesting,"Consolidated hits you with a non-PC message that is a cool, funky delight. I am pretty liberal and these dudes scare me. Buy it, crank it and think!"
2,Copycat review?,"The review for this book from ""a reader from Taiwan"" seems to have been copied from a review I wrote for a research journal, Annals of Tourism Research. Please note that the copier seems to have extracted my favorable remarks and ignored a number of defects identified in my review. The book is not worth 5 stars in my opinion."
2,It's the end of Atlantis (again),"Doctor Who's ninth season ends with an attempt to create a story similar to season eight's ultimate story, 'The Daemons'. Sadly, it failed on TV and it fails with this book.The Doctor, Jo and the UNIT regulars become involved in the new transportation system, TOMTIT, created by Professor Thascales. But little do they realise that the inventor is really the Master, and that to defeat his plans they will have to journey back to ancient Atlantis itself...Many aspects of this story are lifted directly from 'The Daemons', but it remains a pale copy. At the very best, it might be seen as a fun romp for the UNIT family. While Terrance Dicks did a good job in adapting this story, it is such a weak basis to start from that he has no opportunity to make it into anything better."
4,"Raving Lunatic -- a review by Xander, age 9","Calvin is sort of insane - he thinks his stuffed tiger is a real tiger, and he takes pictures of plastic dinosaurs and thinks they're real too. Hobbes is his stuffed tiger, who is smarter than Calvin, and likes snacks. Together they do crazy stuff, such as when they take saws and cut snowmen's heads apart, or terrorize a girl named Suzie by sledding into her.Very funny and peculiarly interesting for people who like sci-fi, realistic fiction, and humor. When I was in second grade I ran around screaming, ""I'm a raving lunatic"" for no reason whatsoever, and in third grade I spun around on my hands and knees just because I thought it was fun. To other people that might seem crazy too. It seems to me that to Calvin all the stuff he does doesn't seem crazy to him, but to everyone else it does. I think it's a really good book."
4,Good Book,"Daughter enjoyed book. Not as thick as some of the others, but sufficient. Calvin and Hobbs is a family favorite. We have approximately 5 of the series. Good clean humor."
5,Exquisite and beautiful playing by June Chun,"It is a beautiful, and timeless, performance of Clementi's Sonatinas Op. 36 & 38 by June Chun. She plays the music with great feeling. I love this CD, and highly recommend it!"
3,If you love Zak then this is for you,"Im a fan of ghost adventures and this is ok if you like that show but its not edge of your seat viewing. The basic deal is 2 ghosthunting groups compete with each other to get the best evidence and are judged on visual,audio evidence and skills such as history of the location. Whoever wins gets bragging rights.I got a little bored and the contestants used the same equipment over and over again. However it wasnt horrible and I watched the whole series so if you like paranormal shows you will probably enjoy this and you do end up supporting one team over the other and the locations are good with background information given about the previous paranormal evidence captured."
2,It was okay,"Well... this was an interesting show and experience... like the other posts on here, this is written by a contestant. I give this show 2 stars... 1 for the free trip to Rolling Hills... and 1 more for introducing us to Jordan Murphy.... other than that, it was a pretty trainwreck"
4,Almost as Good as the First!,"Though one main character from the first film has a different actor playing the part, the sequel adds a whole new twist to the first movie's plot. More eye candy is added and arousal increased over the first film, but the overall entertainment wasn't as good as the original. Comedy is in full swing and definitely increased over the original as well!"
2,Falls A Little Short,"I bought this film on the strength of the first film, Eating Out. It was an enjoyable movie, but the lines that brought such laughter from Gwen (Emily Brooke Hands) and some of the other cast were absent from this film. The first film was set in Tucson, AZ, but this film appears to be studio based. It is an OK movie, but if you're expecting the laughter that was based on the lines in the first film, you'll be disappointed in this one."
2,Sequels are rarely as good as the originals!,"I enjoyed the original movie so much that I have watched it again and again, and have recommended it to friends, who also loved it. I could barely make it through this sequal the first time!"
3,Stupid but Fun to Watch,"The whole shooting and presentations of both two releases just focused on Bodies, Faces and Sex a bit much. The movies are more candy for the eyes rather than storyline attractions!Neverthless, still worth to watch it while you are eating!"
4,Playing Together,"A funny comedy of young Americans playing each with other and their surrounding peppered with laugh, sex and easy-going affairs.Entertaining to the edge."
2,Visually entertaining,The leading man was handsome and fun to look at. The script and acting were lame. I felt more could have been done to make this script work.
4,"Many smiles, hidden truths and great fun!",One can only view this with sensual pleasure. There are muscular young bodies to give joy to the eye and verbal jokes a plenty. What's not to like? The ending scenes are not only a laugh riot but a warning to those who would try to fit all in a single mold.
1,sucks,stupid - sucked. dumb actors. no sex. too many women. wtf? waste of money and time. dont rent this one.
2,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this movie. Acting not good. Story was extremely predictable.It was ok but wish I had spent the money on something else.
5,Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds (2006),"Eating Out 2 is slightly better than the previous movie, but thanks only to the actor. Brett Chukerman and Marco Dapper other than being very nice guy, are also quite good. Truth be told, I still can't understand why Brett Chuckerman is the image of gay fantasies (here and also in The Curiosity of Chance), I find him more puppy look than sexy wet dream, but maybe it's only me. Instead Marco Dapper with his role of naive country boy lost in the frat college atmosphere is so cute that it's quite convincing in his role of hard fought prize. I wouldn't mind a bit less of trashy scenes, but overall, Eating Out 2 is an enjoyable comedy. Again, I wouldn't mind to see more developed the relationship between Marc and Kyle."
1,"three Bs.....boring, bland and bleak","This book doesn't even deserve one star. I've never been more disappponted than I am with Keeper of the Keys. I was bored from beginning to end. I don't think I will ever buy another O'Shaughnessy book. It was so poorly written that it didn't even seem like it was written by the same author. Boy, have the O'Shaughnessy sisters ever lost their edge. They never should have strayed from O'Reilly. You shouldn't fix what ain't broke. Now it's very broke and there ain't no way to fix it. What a waste of my time and money. UGH!"
3,A Nice Departure,"Actually, I almost didn't buy this book because I thought it was going to be another Nina Reilly. That series has gotten so worn out, I don't think I could stand another episode. (Talk about boring and repetitive...)""Keeper of the Keys"" is definitely not a 5 star effort, but I think it's a solid 3+. Part of the attraction for me was the local setting. Mary and Pamela (""Perri"") really do seem to know the Whittier area. It was a quick , easy read - perfect for mindless entertainment at the end of a busy day."
2,Not a Nina Reilly,"Perhaps I should have read the synopsis a bit closer, but after waiting several weeks to receive a much-anticipated new Perri O'Shaugnessy book, I was disappointed in the story. Being used to the tightly woven and fast-paced plots of the Nina Reilly tales, this story seemed loose-jointed and did not move forward at the same rate that I was turning pages. The author(s) spent more time describing parking problems in the Valley than character development. And the plot twists just did not seem to hold - there was a definite, and uncomfortable, blurring of the lines between antagonists and protagonists. I finished the book just to see if it would get better, and while there is a surprise ending, it just did not justify the rest of the story. Please, give me another Nina Reilly story and I'll once again be in the front row of Perri O'Shaugnessy fans."
1,Who wrote this book???,"I just forced myself to finish Keeper of the Keys. I kept thinking and hoping that it would eventually get better, more interesting and finally make some real sense. Didn't happen...What a corny, confused, disjointed mess of a story. The entire plot was (thankfully) so unlike the other good novels the O'Shaughnessy gals have written. Rarely do I feel reading a book is totally a waste of time, but this is the exception. There was nothing to be gained or learned or enjoyed or appreciated by the reading of this novel. I don't know why they chose this story line, but it was in my opinion a big mistake. It was not clearly thought out nor written in an intelligent, engaging way. It was boring, dull and unfortunately a waste of time."
2,More Depth please,"This is not one of the Nina Reilly series of books. I say that because when an author deviates from their stock characters, one never knows what the outcome will be. This is a fine book with a predictable storyline. The characters seem a little too shallow and self-absorbed for my taste, but as a nice comfy read it's ok. There are no great surprises, nor thrilling episodes, just a quick and easy read.The premise that a crime may or may not have been committed falls short with no evidence nor forensics to tell either way. The shifting from locale to locale is confusing at times. I think the book would have been better if more time had been taken to give the characters a three dimensional aspect. They are a bit one sided and plastic.Coming to grips with one's emotions and deciding what one wants to do about forgiveness and their future should have more depth."
2,Book,"Did not care for this book since I felt that not only was it a slow moving book, but there were things brought into the book that did not have anything to do with the plot."
2,"Weak characters, poor plot","I was not a fan of this novel. It got off to a bad start in the opening chapters because the main character is so unlikeable. From that point forward, I didn't care one way or the other what happened to him. Ray Jackson is a self-absorbed architect, whose wife Leigh leaves him after a fight. There is nothing redeemable about the character, and none of the other characters were well developed. The plot was silly. For some reason, the reader is supposed to believe that Ray kept keys from his childhood houses and is breaking into them to find out the secrets of his past. I suppose the author didn't consider that most people change the locks when they move into a house. And despite Ray's wife cheating on him, everything is fine between them when they reunite. I would not recommend reading this book.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
2,Not their best work,"I've read all the books in the Nina Reilly series and they were really enjoyable but this stand alone attempt is pretty bad. The writing is long winded and convoluted, the story does not play out well and by the end you realize it doesn't make a bit of sense. I truly hope they go back to the style of writing they are used to and get off this path quickly. This book was a real disappointment."
1,How Can People Like This Book?,"I won't even go bore you with the storyline of this novel, because that might make it sound interesting and the absolute last thing I want to accomplish in this review it to give you any inclination to read this book. To put it eloquently, it sucked--though not hard enough or long enough to be worth even a good laugh. Don't waste your precious time on it. The whole thing is gratingly cliché. Plow as you will through the miry cast of annoyingly trite characters and mediocre prose in order to ultimately discover the big twist you are so obviously set up for, the big surprise will leave you so thoroughly unsatisfied you just might have to take a cold shower."
1,KEEP away from this book,"I really like all of Perri O'Shaughnessy's books. The Nina Reilly character is a really well fleshed-out character. Unfortunately, none of the characters in this book are ; whether it be Ray Jackson, his wife Leigh, or her childhood friend Kat. I started this book twice and finally muddled through it. It's a horrible story, with a confusing plot and no real crime. I'm thankful at least that I didn't spend any money on it and borrowed it instead from the Library. Skip this book and pick up any of the Nina Reilly series."
2,Not the Best of the O'Shaughnessy',"I have every book that Perri O'Shaughnessy has written and have enjoyed them all--until this one. Sorry ladies.I found this story too slow moving and weird. A man's wife leaves him after an argument and is missing for several days. Instead of looking for her or enlisting the aid of the police, friends, and family, (he has strange priorites) he uses old keys (please people, if you buy a new house, get the locks changed)to break into houses where he use to live--he is looking for clues to his past as his mother won't tell him anything about his deceased father and why they so often moved."
2,disappointing,"I am a great fan of these writers. That alone is why I purchased this book, however, I hope this isn't the only new direction they are taking, if it is I am afraid they just lost a big fan. I am sure they want to write something different than Nina novels but if they do they need to write on at least the Nina level!Characters and storyline were dull, the best part was the area of the country the book centered on.I only completed the book because I bought it and felt I owed it to the ladies to see what else they write. I know they worked hard at it.I do look forward, as I always do, to the next book by P.O'S.. However,if the preview doesn't include Nina,the reading of 2 dull books in a row (including ""Sinister Shorts"") will have seriously damped my interest in these writers."
5,Live,"I must admit, I have not read this book. However, I am a huge fan of the rock group ""Live"", and they have a song called ""T.B.D"". This song is truly awesome. Since this song is so great, and Live is so great, you just add the two positives together. And there you have it. I highly recommend everyone to buy this book, 'cause I am! Norwegian Live fan!"
2,Historically significant but very flawed translation,"Evans-Wentz is to be honored as a pioneer scholar of Tibetan studies but he made some serious mistakes, including giving this book the misleading name Tibetan Book of the Dead based on the rage for the Egyptian Book of the Dead at the time. Read The Hidden History of the Tibetan Book of the Dead by Cuevas for more information. The truth is there are multiple Tibetan books and practices associated with these teachings. Do yourself a favor and explore more than this one."
4,An exciting mystery!,"In this book, Nancy Drew goes to see a circus and feels sorry for a little boy who appears to be abused by his master. Nancy is surprised when he shows up at her home. He wears a mysterious ivory charm in the shape of an elephant that is supposed to protect the wearer from harm. He gives it to Nancy. She will surely need protection soon after, because she must investigate a mysterious hideout and missing jewels. Could it be that the mystery of the room in the cave and the shady circus are related? read to find out! I would also recommed buying the applewood books fascimle edition of this story. It is priced higher but it is the original story from the 30's. Buy both versions for some flavor and to see how the story was changed."
3,Why are kindle books so pricey?,"Love my Kindle, my Daughter loves the Nancy Drew books. But, why are electronic books so pricey? They are almost as much, if not the same price, as the printed copies."
5,The Mystery of the Ivory Charm,I bought this book for my wife's collection. She reads them and loves all the Nancy Drew books. We plan on buying more of them.
5,AWESOME,I love Chuck Pierce and highly recommend any and all of his books. I have totally enjoyed everything that I have purchased by him. Be ready to be blessed. he is truly a teacher of the word. I also enjoy his sharing of true life experiences and how he and his family came through the tough challenging times by trusting God.
3,Demystifying the Voice of God?,"If you really want to test your understanding of any subject, try explaining it to a child.Take, for example, the often enigmatic process of hearing and recognizing the voice of God. Most adults couldn't explain this mystery to one another, much less a child. However, When God Speaks makes a valiant effort towards ""demystifying"" this subject.For critical thinkers, the authors' attempt to establish a broad and far-reaching definition of prophecy will give you plenty to mull over as you compare it to those things which are directly spelled out in Scripture. And for those interested in dreams, visions, signs and wonders, there's an interesting guide included in the appendix."
4,A Classic,"Oasis, amongst others, cite Lee Mavers and the La's as a major influence, and it's not hard to see why. They both have an obsessive devotion to 60's music, both Noel gallagher and Lee Mavers produce extremely catchy guitar based pop, both engage in minor plagarism ( ""There She Goes"" owes it's main riff too The Byrd's ""Mr. Tambourine Man""), both milk the Manchester angle for all it's worth. Hell, Liam Gallagher even sings like a higher pitched Mavers! The La's were truly inspiring for the time, with many of the album's tracks having the potential to be number ones - ""Way Out"" ""Timeless melody"" ""I Can't Sleep"" in particular. In fact, the only spot on this excellent album is the stupid, cloying, ""Freedom Song"" which has the ugliest melody ever committed to disc."
4,Hey. Wow.,"      Today I pulled out my old, old copy of ""The La's"", brushed off 13 years of dust, and put it in. After so much time, I wasn't expecting much, considering the only song I'd actually found likeable all those years ago was the very last, ""Looking Glass"". But now I've been listening to it, after all this time, and wow, it's a whole different CD. I guess my tastes have evolved, because as much as I liked way back when, I like a lot more musically than I did. And some of it, is stuff I'd not have listened to, that I didn't care for.      I find it worthy. However. A great many people must've thought what I was thinking, because it seems to not have taken a hold here in the U.S., as it's only available as an import now. Not that it matters to me. I got my copy years ago. And beneath all the dust of being dumped on the shelf to face the weathering destruction of time forgotten and alone, it plays just fine. And luckily so, for it'll get played quite a bit from here on."
5,Great CD,"Years ago I heard the La's heartbreaking ""There She Goes"" on a Top 40 station. But for some reason it never received heavy rotation (this was 1990 or 1991 when Vanilla Ice and Marky Mark permeated the airwaves). Years later I bought the La's one and only CD expecting that to be the only decent song but I found the other songs were great, too."
4,"Man-o-man, is this gooooooooood.","I suppose I got into this spot because I've been waiting for another Lee Mavers project ever since I bought this record in 1990. Yep, I thought I'd check to see if there where any other recordings available that I could get my hands on....Eric Clapton said it best in a Rolling Stone interview back in the early 90's. When asked what new bands he was listening to he mentioned only The La's and how he really liked the simplicity, songwriting and talent of The La's leader Mavers.If you have ever heard any of the Cast records, Cast sounds a bit like The La's. The bass player and backup vocalist from The La's fronts the band. He even shares a similar vocal quality.I would recommend this record if you love melody, three minute pop songs and 60's skiffle."
5,awesome,"this is by far one of my favorite albums. i am actually buying another copy because the original cd is so warped and scratched from being tossed around my discman, stereo and car radio. btw: the reason there is no follow-up is not laziness so much as it is insanity. i heard lee mavers snapped."
3,The pop masterpieces and a load of filler,"Not really sure if I care that this is their only album or not. Like most, I bought it based on ""There She Goes"" back in 91-92. Still a wonderful blast of pop perfection, that one. Actually I have to say that ""Timeless Melody"" is my actual favorite. Closing out the trio of great songs is the wonderful ""Looking Glass"". Three wonderful songs. Hate to say it, but I pretty much hate the rest of the album across the board. (Bored may be more apt). Don't know what Mavers is up to knowadays. Not sure anyone does. The sorta offshoot Cast are alright, but the time I saw them live they were basically too high to play their songs."
3,ok,this story was ok. i agreed with the reviewer that said it was a little blah. first time i have read this author.
2,so slow,"Takes forever to brew! It didn't even get a cup done after heating up and ""brewing"" for 20 minutes or so. Not a very happy camper while waiting and would not recommend to others."
5,Undiscovered,Don't judge Right Said Fred by their US hit I'm Too Sexy. This group goes beyond the quick fetish of that song. They are incredible. Take the time to listen to both of their albums. Their are well worth it!
2,"I Like This Guy, But......","I do like this guy and that is why I bought this CD. I appreciate a guy who trys to make it as a singer-songwriter in this world of sub-par garage bands getting major contracts and videos on MTV. Paul does tell stories and he sticks to his roots. However, I just can't get all excited over his music as a whole package. His structuring of chord progressions, guitarwork, and voice are only adequate as a vehicle for his lyrics. I need more than this to get me to buying more than one CD from any artist. I simply reach the point with every listen where it seems that I am hearing the same song over and over again. I will continue to keep my ears open to him as I do believe he is worth following."
5,"Good Price, Seems to Work Well","This lotion is priced really well, much lower than what you would pay for it in a salon. It smells good, almost like cologne. The smell is not overwhelming like it is in most tanning lotions. I think I tan faster and deeper when I use it. I highly recommend it, this is a good lotion and it is specifically made for us guys."
1,"Fake Product, already opened","Product was not sealed, very watery and no where near as effective as the same lotion in bought locally from a salon."
5,What happened to this artist?,..this album is brilliant. If you like Brenda Rusell you will love Vivienne Mckone. Unfortunately this is her only release.
4,Great pop/soul music with a nostalgic angle.,"It's much too early to call I Am Shelby Lynne a classic, but one thing is for certain: The album is *classical* in its approach.The most obvious sign of the album's retrogressive angle is the recording -- blurred, with tons of echo (a sound evoking Buffalo Springfield's ""Expecting to Fly"" and Phil Spector's works), and arranged to the max. Lynne's voice and singing technique aren't quite pure pop/soul, given her country influences (bearing in mind that many old-school female pop singers also dabbled in country), but it's a unique flavour. Sometimes I'd rather hear Lynne's voice break out of the generally very dense arrangements; occasionally the production drowns her out in waves of guitars and strings.Quite a rush, though, and very catchy."
2,"Nice. But it aint Dusty, and it aint Aretha...","Listened to the first three tracks, then put on ""Dusty in Memphis"". No comparison. To record a soul album, ya gotta be able to sing. Effortless control, killer highs, whispering lows (dig the first words of ""Dusty in Memphis"" - ""Just a little lovin'...""). Shelby isnt there. Not bad - but ya need better than that to compete with the original Atlantic soul. Listen to Shelby, then put on the first two Atlantic Aretha albums, and let the real thing move your world a little."
4,"Doesn't live up to the hype, but thats O.K.","I had to listen to this CD twice to review it honestly. At first listen I couldn't believe all the hype in the industry about her. I felt taken. But after I realized I was angry at the reviewer, I listened again.Shelby has put together a nice CD here. No, she isn't Dusty or Aretha. Hell, she isn't even Sheryl Crow. But this CD is a good listen.""Your Lies"" is a good pop song, but over produced. My faves are ""Leavin'"" & ""Gotta Get Back"". There are no bad songs on this CD. There just aren't any earth shaking monsters, either. She covers a great range of styles, and does them all well.I also went back and forth between 3 or 4 stars for a rating. I decided on 4 stars when I found myself humming ""Why Can't You Be?""This is just one of those albums that you like more every time you listen to it. It won't live up to the hype, but it won't be forgotten in the back of the CD shelf either. I'm already going for a third listen."
2,"Good voice, unremarkable songs.",She has been wrongly compared to the late/great Dusty Springfield (although sometimes she is close to Dusty's phrasing/style). This cd is not a new Dusty in Memphis due to the fact that almost all the songs included are mediocre. She is a good singer but she is not the best voice in Country Music as some critics have called her. The best contemporary female country singer is Trisha Yearwood.
2,Almost,"Shelby obviously has a wonderful voice, but this material holds her back. I'll pass it along to a friend rather than keeping it."
1,change is not always better,"once upon a time, in the 90's, there was a country artist named shelby lynne. awesome voice. great tunes. sounded good on the the radio and some of it was even fun to dance to. OK, some tunes were a bit formulaic, maybe a little slick, but i was a fan and bought them all. suddenly, enter the ""identity crisis"". here comes the new & improved shelby lynne, bearing no likeness of the old one. guess what? the new album is a dud and i am in no way convinced by anything on it. change in pointless unless it is for the better. i listened to each song with disbelief - what happened to the shelby lynne we all loved?? maybe she was abducted by aliens - there's no way the old shelby would have ever released a stinker like this."
3,I AM SHELBY LYNNE,"Voice ok, but, she is no Dolly Parton..... She needs songs with pathos and meaning and leave out the ""rock"". If she does that, she could be great...."
1,I am Shelby Lynne,"I'm an old fan, so I thought I would love her latest. I really disliked most of the songs and will be exchanging the CD shortly. Besides the big shift in styles (even on the same CD), I don't think she shows off her great voice well. I'm all for artists growing and finding their niche, but I don't think this is the right one."
1,another overrated thing I just did not understand,"when it came out, Amoeba records staff praised it, so I bought it. God I hated it instantly. Could not see how it was anything different than, I don't know, Shania Twain? Ok, maybe that's unfair. But you can take Alt-Country only so far before it becomes just Contemporary Country, which just blows. Classic country and contemporary country are like classic jazz and ""Smooth"" jazz- one is timeless, the other's full of overproduced turds. No thanks."
5,A great collection.,"I am not a C.W. fan really, but this is a great collection of sassy, strong and introspective songs. I have not listened to this in years and it sounds sooo good. Shelby is a great talent and her new c.d. is great."
4,This is one to own,"I knew about Shelby Lynne earlier in her career, but the clinher to buy the CD was her grammy award. This is a little different than her first CD. More of a bluesy and soul experience than a rockabilly. It still is a great CD to mellow and relax to."
5,"Great, but there is room for improvement.","Wow! What can I say about this album that would do it justice! This is not an album that you just listen to once because it takes multiple listens to discover the beauty of it! Great songs and a great voice let Shelby rise far above what Bill had in mind, which was to over produce this album. And what is even more enjoyable is how catchy these quality songs really are. I am really looking forward to what this artist does in the future. HINT FOR SHELBY: Dump Bill! Sheryl Crow (who is my favorite artist) dumped him and made two of the best albums I have ever heard. Shelby you don't need him! GRADE: A- The should be music critic."
4,Superb album,"Note that i rarely give an album 5 stars (5 stars are the kind that Ok Computers and Joshua Trees or Together Alones are made of). The record is already out in Europe. After a first listen i found her music a bit ordinary and her voice flat. But after repeated listenings you wil find jewel after jewel... The singalong ""Your lies"" and the wonderful melancholic closing track ""Black light blue"" And then you realize it: there isn't a weak track on this disc ! Her voice really grows on you too .... definitely the strongest female artist og 99... along with Macy Gray"
4,Where'd she come from?,"Oh boy. This is good. I bought I Am Shelby Lynne after reading a few interesting reviews. Sometimes I get burned doing that, but man, not this time. I was expecting something a little more traditionally country, and then Your Lies came blasting out of my speakers, sounding like country rock and roll produced by Phil Spector. There are quite a few great songs on this CD, including I Thought it Would Be Easier and Where I'm From. Lynne has a husky, real voice that complements the orchestral feel of the music perfectly. We play this CD around our house all the time, and my 4 year old son likes it too. I can't wait to see Shelby in concert. Shelby, come to Montana!"
5,Shelby Lynne is one of a kind,"I can't add any better words to all the rich descriptions said about her and this album from others, except that she is one of a kind. Anything she does is unique and connects. The only other singer/songwriter I felt drawn to because of his unique sound and story-telling is Cat Stevens. It's because they both sing with raw emotion and passion and their lyrics are so dang profound! Get this album. Get all of 'em!"
5,Soulful,"Country singer, Shelby Lynne, has graduated from the School of Rhythm & Blues, and she's learned her lessons well. This album is repleat with the soulful chord progressions and vocal renditions that characterized the best R&B of the 60s. But this is no imitation-of-the-past album. There are enough nuances within each song to make this a truly unique recording. The best part is Ms. Lynne's singing. I have no doubt that she has experienced every emotion she sings about. She sings from the heart.I have a copy, in one form or another, of every album recorded by Van Morrison. My testimony is that I intend to have a copy of every album recorded by Shelby Lynne."
2,Very uneven,"Track 1: an excellent homage to Phil Spector's girl group songs, track 2: a wonderful, deep homage to soul music. For me the rest of this CD is completely forgettable."
2,I Miss the Old Shelby,"I simply love Shelby Lynne's previous works Restless and Temptation. Restless has such an upbeat style that accentuates her wonderful voice. This album, I Am Shelby Lynne, has a totally different, depressing style. I understand an artist has the right to record a different style album, but I exercised my rights and got rid of this new CD within a week. I will continue to praise this artist but not this particular work."
3,ABOUT 'I AM SHELBY LYNNE',"VOICE IS GOOD, BUT, SHE IS NO EMMY-LOU HARRIS AS PROMISED, OR FOR THAT MATTER, DOLLY PARTON. A LITTLE LESS OF THE ""ROCK"" FEELING AND A BIT MORE OF THE ""REAL"" FEELING PLEASE. CHECK OUT ""TRIO"" AND ""TRIO II"" TO SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT."
2,She's Shelby Lynn And You Aren't,"I rather expected to like Shelby Lynn, and she even sounded ok at first blush, but her sub Bonnie Rait posturing just does not cut it. The album pretty well hits one note, and it doesn't seem to hit that one with any real feeling. It just ain't there."
1,Blinded By The Hype,"Every once in a while I ignore my red flags and buy a CD based on the overwhelming positive press/reviews I read...""I shoulda known better""...maybe I'm too well adjusted (or too stupid to know I'm not) but after listening to the CD I wanted a bottle of cheap scotch and a dimestore cigar...if Shelby were trying to capture a dark and gloomy tone - bulls eye!...the cover should have tipped me off...I ignored it...""I see a red door and I want to paint it black""...I passed the CD on - my old friend gave it back!...jeeze Shelby, if this was an attempt to be yourself: lighten up...take me to a better place or at least help me forget where I am now...a great voice, good production, bad direction...next time: I'll listen first, then check with the good folks at ...... won't get fooled again...The MAD Drummer"
4,Lush and soulful,"This one sold out at local record store. Both country and rock reviewers loved it. The first song Your Lies just jumps out at you. Also loved Thought it Would Be Easier and Leavin'. It is hard to classify Shelby Lynne on this CD, just really good music. Never heard of her but definitely a fan of hers now."
4,"Fantastic, raw and at times depressing................","This cd is all of the above and more to me. At first listening to this cd, I was frustrated that Lynne's voice continued to trail off into an almost inaudible whisper on various songs, and I also found myself uncomfortable with the confessional tone of many of the pieces. Upon many more listens I have grown to really love this cd. Her voice sounds very bluesy to me, and the writing on such songs as ""Thought it would be easier"" ""leaving"" and ""Why can't you be"" are first rate. Her voice is raw and perfect for the songs chosen, though I do have to strain to hear her in places. I do love this cd, but I do not listen to it as often as some of her others, because it can be depressing. Too depressing, but her talent was finally acknowledged as a result of this cd, and I'm glad the world took note."
5,She is the real deal.,"On listening to just a few of the songs from ""I am Shelby Lynne"" on the radio, her singing resonnated with some place deep in my mind. After listening to her CD just a few times, I feel she will become a very signifigant artist, popular or not. Or maybe I have just fallen in love. She uses Country, Blues, and other american music styles and trancends them to become... well, ""Shelby Lynne"", a great songwriter with a beautiful voice. It doesn't get any better than this."
4,"Thanks, Glamour!","I only bought this CD because Glamour reviewed it as one of the best CDs of the year. So I figured, what the heck, I'll try it on for size. I definitely enjoyed it. I didn't listen to it very much in the beginning, and that's the only reason it gets four stars instead of five. It takes a little while to grow on you, and it's not the kind of CD you just pop in your car on your two hour drive home from college. However, if you sit and listen to it, and let the words grab you, then you will experience the real feeling and meaning of this lyrical message. Shelby Lynne's CD is bold and creative, and very emotional, which is what I'm really looking for sometimes. I didn't really classify this in any specific genre, because it's not country, it's not rock, and it's not pop...it's a good mixture that really sucks you in. So, I recommend it, especially to college girls who are looking for something better than NSYNC or Savage Garden and who really need some empowerment and inspiration."
4,"Amazon recommendation, right on target","This has been a recommendation by the Amazon computers every time I logged on for longer than I can remember. Well, I finally picked it up, and whoever programs that thing was right with this one.At first, I listened all the way through and wasn't completely enraptured - I hadn't been sure what to expect. She reminded me most of Sheryl Crow, with a bit of a country edge. But the more I listened to the CD, the more it grew on me - and now I can't get the songs out of my head.I'm sure her recent Grammy Award for Best New Artist will help catapult her into the limelight a little more (and her looks won't hurt, either), which could be fun. She seems to be willing to experiment with her sound, so the next few albums could be interesting."
5,A Well Deserved Grammy,"After seeing Shelby Lynne perform live with Sheryl Crow on the Grammys, I was so impressed with her performance I went out and bought her ""I Am Shelby Lynne"" cd. Granted that this cd falls short of 40 minutes long, each minute of each song is so good. I can hear bits of Dusty Springfield in Shelby's music. I really wouldn't call this cd ""country"" since there are more elements of blues, pop and torch in Shelby's songs than there were country elements. My particular favorites are ""Leavin'"", ""Your Lies"" and ""Why Can't You Be?"" but every song is very good in its own way. Shelby definitely deserved that Grammy award."
1,Not Soul and Certainly Not Country,This was one of the worst CDs I ever purchased. The arranging is uninspired and the musicianship is questionable. I am heading for the used CD store to unload this thing.
1,"if you liked ""restless"" or ""temptation"", forget it","""I Am Shelby Lynne"" is just one more reason why country music lovers will hate the suits who control the recording industry in Nashville. That Ms Lynne has released this album after her previous work, however, also leads one to question her musical integrity. This is one of the most disappointing CDs I have purchased lately."
1,"Try with some other songwriters, why not?","Shelby has her true vocal abilities, but in no way she can be compared neither to Aretha Franklin nor to the great Dusty Springfield who was able to sing wonderfully any music style.Besides, those who write all their material, are finally copying themselves, Shelby Lynne is not an exception."
1,Must Buy,"All I can say it's like crusin' down a country road with the top down and the music blastin'. I love the songs and what there about. This a buy for any girl that has loved a man, talked to a man or has just bushed up against a man in her life time."
2,Common fare,"""I Am Mediocre"" would be a better title. Not as good as Delaney and Bonnie from ""back in the day."" The only right thing is the price."
5,Dixie Chick...NOT - This girl is WAY beyond Nashville,"I am always searching for soulful, diverse singers, and bought this CD after hearing reviews like ""Defies Classification..""...etc. Well, let me say that this CD is hypnotic and sooooo incredibly soulful, that I am in love with it. Her lyrics are rooted in deep, heartfelt emotions that kind of remind me when Jackson Browne writes of his heartache...people who call this CD depressing are missing the point - it's an expression of depression that we all need to hear - so, keep growing and singing Shelby.....please!"
4,Wish I had more time to play!,I enjoy this game. Keeps me up on my younger years with learning my Mythology stories. has a lot of playing time and is challenging too.
5,"An Actual ""Strategy Guide""",Its hard to find good strategy guides for games lately. This was one game I'm happy they made a good strategy guide for. Sybex really did a good job on giving a very informative yet concise explanation on both single player AND multiplayer strategies. Excellent book. I would recommend this to anyone who has this game. Cant wait for the expansion for this game either (and its strategy guide of course!)
3,Better than Most,"Much better than the typical rush-job that characterizes this genre. While it is padded with some of the usual unnecessary material, and although the tables at the end of the book are largely useless, there's more than enough useful practical advice to make this book worth looking at before playing. ""Serious"" players of Age of Empires should also take note: Age of Mythology is different enough that you shouldn't brush off this book as unnecessary."
2,Fictional account of Paul,"It is unfortunate that film writers and directors think they can improve on a true story by adding a substantial amount of fictional material and changing some the events as they actually occurred. I am always hopeful when a new Bible or historical film comes out that it will combine biblical/historical accuracy with modern technology. This film had the technology, but strayed considerably from the biblical text and the historical events.If you want to learn the real story of Paul, you should watch either ""The Visual Bible"" series on ""Acts,"" which is word for word from the Bible, or watch the ""Peter and Paul"" film in which Anthony Hopkins plays Paul. Both of these films are considerably more accurate than ""Paul, the Apostle."""
5,The Best Version of Saint Paul,This is the best version of Saint Paul. All actors mesh well together and Johannes Brandrup is an excellent actor.
5,Great Film despite nudity,"This movie brings scripture alive in a visual way. However, the main detractor was about three brief moments where the ""tares"" in hollywood had to inject nude scenes into the film...this added nothing and was a big detractor for some of my friends and family. If this film will inspire just one to be convicted by the Holy Spirit (and I believe more than one will) to come to the cross and be saved then God's work will be done! The good news is, He will take care of the tares too!"
1,different gospel,"The acting is good, but this video tells a different record of the apostle Paul's experiences. It features an imaginary movie plot that twists the gospel record to the extent that Paul's nephew who alerts a Roman official of a plot to kill Paul, is switched to a young woman. Makes good, action entertainment perhaps, but portrays little of Paul's zeal for the gospel he so fiercely preached and died for."
1,Paul the Apostle,Screen writers have a responsibility to write historical films based on fact or fiction drawn from the imagination. Movie fans will appreciate one or the other. This film is fiction posing as historical fact. It is misleading and dishonest.
4,"Very good, but lack of ending!","I recomend this movie (to all those who are not familiar with the scrptures, what should do) to watch exactly after ""The Passion of Christ"". The event took place 40 days later and the movie was extraordinary on ambientation, localtions, names...The only bad think is the end... is like the movie end 45 minutes earlier, you got it?? anyway, is a good movie, just 4 star for the ending"
5,The Essence of Paul,Bravo! Well done. The essence of Paul as well as what he set out to accomplish is well depicted in this film. Also represented and well handled are all the internal and external conflicts and intrigues of religion and politics of mid first century Palestine that impacted so much on the fledgling new church. I recommend this film to all serious Bible students.
1,What kind of movie is this???,"Very sadly I have spent 3 hours of my time to see another work made for financial reasons. The movie is absolutely unreliable. Who is Ruben? Did a Roman general kill him on the Bible? Ruben's wife denounces a plot to kill Paul??? Does he appeal to go to Rome as portrayed in the movie??? These are just a few remarks in this work. What could be a great movie, since Paul's story is really powerfull is actually a bunch of historical facts mixed with extra biblical material (fantasy)and antibiblical material (lies about the story). Don't you dare spend your money or time with this. ""Peter and Paul"" from the 80's is more realible."
1,Bad Bad movie,"Do not waste your money on this video. This movie is far from the truth of God's Word. It has a seen where the men are in something like a spa and you could see their buttocks my daughter was watching the movie with me and I had to forward it. I tried to look at it a little longer but it was so far fron the truth of the bible that i took it out and threw it in the trash. Thats what i think about the movie, trash. IF I could have given it a 0 star i would have. I feel you should make themovi accurate or don't make it at all. This is just satans way of twisting the word of god again."
4,Really Loved this movie about the life of Paul......more like 4.5 stars,"This is a very well done movie about the life of Paul...it's well acted and the production was well funded enough to NOT leave reminding you of how crummy the costumes were in the middle of the film. I'd say if you're a Christian or interested in History, see this movie for sure. If you are neither of those (a Christian or History buff) I think it depends on what types of movies you like. IF you're into Terminator and Avatar, I'd guess this would not have enough action for you. BUT if you like well done dramas.....rent or buy it. It was good. I actually really enjoyed it and wouldn't mind owning it."
2,critique of paul the apostle,"we viewed it as a family, and found it to be errant in very many aspects of pauls life. the vehicle of friends alleged friends of paul, rueben and dina were not scritural, distracting, and too unbelievable as characters. segments of barnabus and pauls journey did not portray accurately pauls association as found in the book of Acts. acting was fairly poor. better to see Peter and Paul with anthony hopkins"
1,I'd Give It A ZERO,"There is absolutely nothing good to say about this movie! Zero! Nada! Nil! It is the worst Bible-inspired movie I have ever seen and I am so disgusted with it! Unfortunately I cannot return an open item so I guess I am stuck with this useless piece of junk for the rest of my life! But I can always throw it in the trash! What were the producers thinking when they made this movie? Which Bible did they base this Paul saga from? I'd give it a ZERO, but a ""Zero star"" wasn't an option!"
2,Dont Bother,"Gratuitous nudity?Saul of Tarsus standing at the stoning of Stephen as a 'disturbed' spectator, only holding the coats of the real baddies, unable to work up any vigor or genuine approval?Saul of Tarsus having a rebellious woman as one of his best friends and confidantes?Only when Saul was converted and Paul emerged and began his ministry does the movie pick up and begin to conform more to what the gospel teaches us about who Paul was.Unfortunately, Paul's ministry was so dynamic and vast, there's no way it can be contained to a single, 2 hour movie. The life of Paul would be better represented in a mini series.I appreciate the efforts here, but too much time was devoted to making Saul a 'sympathetic' character and the truth of his conversion is weakened, when the Biblical reality of it is so much more."
1,Celine T.,"I know that the DVD was a used one when I ordered it. However, when I received it, I can't play it because too much scratches on the DVD, it froze. That's why I had to return."
4,A Biblical Movie,Have not seen this yet. So I can not tell yet. But since it it a bible title it should be a good movie. I just happen to like stories like these.I have this movie in my collection.
5,An Interesting Time in History,I enjoyed this DVD and found it to be pretty accurate over all. Some characters were added to help tell the story but they seemed to fit well.
2,Hawaii Video,The island scenes are nice but it is a boring video. You put it on to play while you work as background noise. They focus too long on beach scenes and water.
5,Fantastic Scenic Adventure with Relaxing Music and Narration,"We bleeping love this tour of Hawaii. Best I've ever seen, and beats any DVD I've bought from Amazon. You will be delighted. Even the music is relaxing and enjoyable. This is great for meditation, scenic wonders and workouts in front of your HD. The standard resolution is plenty good and free if you have Amazon Prime--everyone should get Prime anyway because it's a fantastic food deal and you get everything in 2 days.Enjoy!"
3,Not quite what I expected,"I'm excited for an upcoming trip to the Big Island, so I was hoping to get some good information about places to visit or at least some stunning visuals. This was not that video. It was a very slow, soothing (think classical music) look at various islands. But it wasn't a terribly engaging look. There seemed to be a lot of stills and close ups of flowers (maybe I'd have appreciated this more if I had been to Hawaii). The information they gave was interesting, but the pictures had nothing to do with what they were talking about. When you talk about whales, show me whales. (On second viewing, I realized right as they were fading out there was the top of a whale at the edge of the screen).I watched it because it was free on Amazon Prime, but in terms of things to see, ""Hawai'i Island Explored A New Way to Plan, Experience, Explore."" was more of what I had in mind."
2,Hawaii is paradise. But this documentary is technically awful,"Aloha. So, Hawaii is amazing, thus the footage subjects are beautiful. Everything else, though, is mediocre: let's mention photography (mostly uninspired fixed camera, with extremely unprofessional zoom-in's) and superimposed text (where did they find those fonts?). It seems like they bought some poor quality footage and put together a cheap product with it."
2,Hawaii Blu-Ray,This was not my best purchase. Blu-ray quality is not equal to any of the other BD discs in my library.Not what I was hoping for and certainly does not match it's description.
4,"Does boring right, you must give it that.","I like how no one mentiones the bridges - as they must have not played dominion multiplayer and felt the odd effect of having a map with little squares for everyone to build on, and then attempt to bridge into your base.Most of the interface improvements over CnC were later stolen and fully adapted to CnC by Red Alert 2, including the tabs, queue, and some other features.The game really needed to have more refined, polished graphics and more diverse sides, and remove some of the AI retardedness that causes units to stall and requrie micromanagement while doing simple tasks like moving.I'd buy it just to learn about how RTS games evolved."
1,wont work,"From my memory, this is a fun game. If u like games like command & conquer. But I can't get it to play. It says, there isn't enough memory or something,can't remember for sure right now exactly. Whatever it was, its impossible, the computer I'm using has a ton of everything. If someone could let me know whats up, I'd love to play this game."
4,Great music,"I love this CD and I was delighted to find it again, Sybil has a great voice and I enjoy listening to this CD at work and in my truck."
5,her best album,"She came to fame with Don't make me over and the Stock/Aitken/Waterman hit When I'm good & Ready. Sybil has a good voice and usually also well written songs. Her albums are always quite enjoyable. This album is different from her Stock/Aitken/Waterman album - it is more individual and more soul-ish...but got less attention, because there are no big producer's names. It's very smooth & mellow and has quite some fine tracks."
1,Very Poorly Written,"I was very disappointed with this book. Although it has good information, it is very poorly written and hard to follow."
5,Fabulous,"The photography alone makes this book worth buying. It's a wonderful coffee-table book. But, I also found it to be surprisingly educational. The use of photography combined with compelling text, allows for an intimate look into a sub-culture not easily understood and one that is quickly disappearing. It is both timeless and thought-provoking."
4,Fascinating read,"I must say that this book had me fooled. I almost thought it was the story of a real pimp. The pictures are better than the story however and one should be very careful about trying to ""gain game"" from this book. Great for living room display."
2,good reference but horrible as textbook,"This book can be used as a reference if you are already know most of the material. But if you are trying to learn attitude control/determination with background from dynamic system then good luck. Book is full of conceptual thoughts with detail explanation where he arrives at equations. The book also lack real examples and problems are a bunch of derivations that can be easily found in other text. I have good background in aerospace dynamics and have worked in aircraft area. I would recommend Schaub, Junkin's book as their explanations are more systematic and closer to the way aerospace community think including real world examples."
4,Nice,"Handmade, not perfectly straight lines but it gives it character. More than any cheap-y crib board. Gives options for continuous games, etc."
5,Most excellent,"This item is a perfect book for math lovers, who are interested in how math have been solved by the Greeks.The only downside can be, that it's hard to understand at some point, because of the language."
4,Entrancing compilation of traditional West African music,"The music on this disk in an unadulterated representation of the West African bush. It conjures images of village celebrations, palm wine, kerosene lanterns and open air markets. Its hypnotic beat and traditional harmonies are mesmerizing. The sound is real - as real today as it was fifty years ago. This is the perfect disc to focus your mind, or to carry it half way around the world. Unlike so many 'world beat' albums that fuse old with new, this one is a fly on the wall - listening silently, and enjoying immensely."
3,early 90's forever the missed out artist era....,"well im not going to sit here and say that Motif is the greatest of all time but i will say this. They are definitely in a long line of groups and artist that got overlooked, the album itself is ok with the first two tracks standing out the most to me but i actually dig some some of the other songs. Again the list goes on and on for groups that fell thru the cracks and at least for Motif they had a few songs that did not get the props they should have. I definitely be sharing these songs on Piolet with all."
1,not worthy of winslow homers great talent,"I was very dissapointed in this video they don,t even go into detail on his work they review a lot of his watercolors but hardly any of his great oil paintings do yourself a favor avoid it ."
5,As close to perfect as it gets...,"Every song on this album is a gem. And it covers dreams, love, family, sorrow, and politics. I also admit though that I have a soft spot for it. A friend sang ""Like Butter Loves Bread"" at our wedding as my bride walked down the aisle, and every time I listen to that song, I fall in love with my wife all over again.A must own."
2,Don't waste your money,"We bought this high chair instead of the one we wanted because it was $20 cheaper. Well, you get what you pay for. I hate this chair. The tray comes off way to easily, not a good thing. The wheels are terrible. It's easy to clean except for the frills around the vinyl."
2,High Chair Didn't Lock,"We registered for this high chair and received if as a gift. After spending four months in the attic, we put it together. Everything was great with it, but the seat wouldn't lock in the upright position. Everytime you would recline it upright, it fell right back down to the lowest position. We took it back to Babies R Us where it was purchased and even the manager couldn't figure out how to fix it. That part of the seat already comes put together, so it's not something we screwed up. We exchanged it for the same chair so we'll see if that one works out better. If not we're going to a different model. Other than that, we like the chair and it's features. It's just a major hassle to have to put the whole thing together, only to find out that it's defective."
4,Great for big babies!,"I bought this high chair when my baby was 4 months old. My baby was already 19 lbs at this age so when my husband and I shopped for high chairs, we tried our son in every single high chairs in the store. We needed one that will accomodate my huge son and this was the one. With the tray on, his legs had plenty of room, which wasn't the case with other non Graco brands.My son is now almost 7 months & 24 lbs and we continue to use this chair. The 5 point harness is awesome especialy when my son was't very stable sitting up yet. I could leave him on this chair for a potty break without worries.The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the reclining mechanism is not the easiest to use. It does work with one hand operation, but I often have to man-handle it a bit. For some reason it gets stuck and it does't change position as easily as it says it should."
2,Baby gets hot in this chair,"I have a couple of complaints about this chair. The shape of the chair and the plastic chair cover makes the baby hot. We put a thin blanket over the chair before putting him in. The tray cover is great for taking it off to wash it but be careful, it is porous. It stains easily with baby food. The seatbelts are also difficult to get out of the way. I liked the Peg Perego highchair better that I used for my first child."
2,Never Again...,"We bought two of these for our twins when they were born and NEVER AGAIN would I purchase this specific chair. The wheels are horrible (scrape the floor---they don't roll at all like they are supposed to) the tray does not get close enough to the girls to prevent food falling into our lap (our old Cosco cheapy high chair was way better!) and our girls also get their arms caught between the seat and the tray.Also, for future reference for any high chair makers...PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE just make a smooth tray (i.e. no snack or cup holders on the tray, they are a pain to wipe out, especially when having to clean two high chair at a time.)"
3,"OK, but not the greatest, I wouldn't buy it again.","I bought this chair after buying other Graco chairs/products and believed that it would be as good quality. Boy, was I wrong! The cons are; 1. the bar across the bottom of the back legs scrapes the floor and it doesn't scoot well; 2. the top tray (that is supposed to be so great) doesn't fit snuggly against the other tray and my daughter gets her fingers either stuck in between the two trays or she just lifts off the tray (with food on it!); and 3. the large bottom tray handles are so cheap and plastic that they don't move smoothly and the darned thing gets hung up all the time! The one handed button on the front of the tray is totally ineffective, it only works some of the time. I am pretty frustrated with this chair. The only things I like are 1. the colors and 2. the fabric is easy to care for. I wouldn't buy this one again. Hope this helps!"
1,Major Issue with this Highchair,"The seat back of this highchair did not lock in an upright position. It kept falling down. When I returned it, the floor model in the store did the same thing. I hope it is an isolated incident with those two highchairs. Just be careful."
4,The Angry Self: A Comprehensive Approach to Anger Management,This book was both Interesting and informative. It is A great book for Continuing Education Requirements for Mental Health Counselors.
4,pretty for the holidays,"very nice appearance, good price and they wash well and still look good. happy with this purchase and will be for years."
5,I love it,This is just what I was looking for to give my bathroom a Christmas motif. I purchased two red towels and one white one for the bathroom. It really made the bathroom look cheery. This is a good quality towel.
3,Lenox embroidered bath towels,"Good absorbent and pretty towels but expected more by way of quality. The colour (cream) faded a bit after 2 washes, unfortunately, even after hand washing a 3rd time, the softness has disappeared."
2,Lenox Ribbon Towels,"While the towels are lovely they arrived absolutely filthy!I had to work hard to get out all of the grim that was on them.Sadly, I did write to complain, but no one answered my letter.I should have returned them... but it seemed like too much trouble for such a small item."
3,winter greetings,"small fngertip towels, screen printed is OK- a little duller than the photo but overall they looks nice-"
1,DOA,"Not working on receipt. Returned to sender. Replacement not available: alternate watch suggested.Very disappointed: there are no other alarm, analogue watches with this elegant design, that I can find."
2,Size not advertised correctly,"This adapter is advertised as a 5.25, 6, 6.5 to 6x8 but comes as a 5.25 to 6x8. To make a 6.5 speaker fit you need to cut the plastic. This would not be too bad if the adapter was made like a stereo install kit, where the pieces are made to break off to fit a variety of sizes. But this adapter is one solid piece with no perforations or guiding lines or marks to make the resizing in any way easy. As another poster has said, if I wanted to do this much work to make an adapter fit I would have saved my money and made one myself. To sum up, don't buy this if you are expecting a 6 or 6.5 speaker to fit, it won't, it will work fine for a 5.25, and therefore gets 2 and not 1 star."
2,"Quality Excellent, Unfortunately DIDN'T Look Like Picture","The image of this lamp shade shows a surface slope, (approximately 50 degrees) that is much lower than the product received, (approximately 75 degrees). I was disappointed that I didn't get a shade that looked like the picture, but kept the shades that I received because they work and are of good quality."
2,A Metaphorical Masterpiece,"If you like everything explained in metaphorical terms, this is the book for you! The use of metaphors is so massive, so extensive, that one can loose the author's train of thought. He also writes numerous ideas and then follows up with pronouns. We are left puzzled as to what specifically he is talking about. While I found the writing style tedious, the message that I was able to decipher is ok."
5,Westerns,"It's hard for me not to like any western or cowboy movie. Therefore, just about any I would rate a five star."
5,Great collection.,I bought this for my brother and he loves it. He enjoys them very much. Looking forward to other cowboy classics.
1,No subtitles,I was disappointed to find that when I received the DVDs that there are no subtitles or captions for the hearing impaired and there was no notation on the product description to that effect.
5,"Love, Passion, Intensity, Serenity","Somehow, Charles Wilson has managed to fit many of my feelings into one CD. The listening experience really moves me and when its done, it feels complete. There can be the shallowness of a pop-hiphop beat with the depth of soul inspired melodies. There are moments when I hear softly plucked guitars that feel like a light rain falling on rose pedals. There are moments when I feel like a part of a great contest of the human spirit at the Olympics. Very original. Very soulfull. This album has touched my heart."
4,Reliable workhorse,This was one of the first mice I ever bought. I've had it for at least four years and it's performed reliably with every computer it's been connected to. I've brought it with me from job to job and back and forth from home and have never had any problems with it. The buttons always click crisply and the wheel revolves easily. Now I'm buying another one to permanently connect to my home laptop workstation so I can leave one at work and one at home.
5,Delighted.,"I have used at least 5 mice, and this is by far the best. Opened my eyes as to performance. I use it for light retail work, no gaming, etc., and I am 100% satisfied."
4,Problems with Microsoft Intellimouse 3.0,"I purchase intelleMouse 3.0 hoping that it would solve the problem that I had with a similar mouse. At first the mouse worked extremely well exhibiting no sticking. Lately it has been exhibiting some the same problems that I had with the previous mouse. With the first Mouse the scroll bar would move on its own and the would not move smoothly across the page. The problem with the scroll ball is Ok, but now and again the pointer would move so far and stop and and I would have to pickup mouse and and move the pointer again. I am planning to change pad and see if things improve."
3,Oblivion 2,"Not as good as the first, but good for B-movie fans. The acting is overdone, the effects are frugaly done. A B-movie start to finish."
3,Doesn't stand out from the crowd,"Bleed the Dream's ""Awake"" is a fairly bland CD. It's not terrible, just derivative of so many other indie emo bands. They appear to be decent enough musicians, but the songwriting lacks imagination. By the end you can't really tell one song from another. The singer's voice is ok, but he completely overdoes the ""emo"" aspect, wailing out each line like his leg is caught in a bear trap. ""Awake"" is an ok CD that doesn't do anything to stand out from the crowd."
5,Excellent!,If you are interested in signal sleuthing and radio direction finding this book is a MUST READ.
3,Dated but useful,"The book is dated 1987, and obviously a lot has happened in the electronics world in 24 years, but it still has some good info on hunting techniques. As far as I know, it's the only published book on amateur rdf."
1,sounds like a corporate attempt to boost patriotism!,"The only good thing about this record is ""Someday"" and only because of the acoustic guitar and allright lyrics. The rest of the album is totally average. Don't waste your money!"
4,A great debut album!,"I was suprised when I heard this CD. It is defiently good to hear something diffrent in the hip-hop genere. This group combinds rap and rock together perfectly. Not the Linkin Park rap rock, this is something entirley new and it works great.Don't sleep on this album"
4,review from the Synthesis,"Flipsyde has a unique amalgam of sounds that demands even the most discriminating listener delve a little outside of their comfort zone. A stunning mix of hip-hop vocals and beats, Latin acoustic guitar and catchy melodies, We the People bridges the gap between audiences not unlike Linkin Park in method, but with their own flavor. The infusion of guitarist Dave Lopez's Latin riffs really makes the record a diverse array of sounds and styles. Recently on tour in Europe with Snoop Dogg and Black Eyed Peas, this September, Flipsyde will team up with Anger Management veterans Eminem and 50 Cent for more dates. On We the People, Flipsyde gives everything you could ask for in a record, even if you are not a hip-hop fan.- Doug WilliamsSynthesis.net"
3,NO REPLACING REHAB,I WILL ADMIT FLIPSYDE AINT TO BAD . BUT TO ME THEY'RE A UP DATED VERSION OF REHAB WITH A LATIN TWIST . ANY ONE THAT HAS EVER HEARD REHAB CAN HEAR IT . YOU CAN HEAR THEIR MUSIC IN FLIPSYDE
5,I Love this CD!,"I saw Flipsyde when they opened up for the Pussycat Dolls and the Black Eyed Peas at Madison Square Garden in NYC.I was pretty impressed while watching them because I had never heard of them (since then, I have seen them on Jay Leno) and I was enjoying their performance.I bought the cd two weeks ago and haven't been able to shut if off since! I love every song and hope they make many more cd's... I'll buy every one of them!! ENJOY!"
3,Missing some pieces,"I am a clinical psychologist and need to know about psych. meds. I love the readability and the extensive detail in print. There is even more material on each drug available at the website which is reached with the CD in the back. It is a gigantic book -2900 pages and more accessible and with more drugs than the PDR. BUT, I just looked up two meds which are in the book (under their generic names) but not listed or listed incorrectly in the listing of trade names. Just a little concerned. Also, despite its 2004 publication date and title, it does not cover Abilify or Strattera, released in the las year. However, for its size and comprehensiveness you cannot beat the price, especially compared to the PDR."
1,Very poorly written; no real facts,"Having stayed at the Bellagio, I was intrigued to learn more about Steve Wynn and bought this book. Unfortunately, it is very poorly written, lacking organization, and even more lacking in factual citations.Granted Steve Wynn is not an angel. But I thought that the allegations in this book should be backed up by adequate citations.Finally, the book is so poorly written in terms of sentence structure that I just groaned every time I turned the page."
1,Some connections are missing!,"This book is misnamed! It should have been called ""The Six Degrees of Steve Wynn"" after the game where you can connect anyone in Hollywood to anyone else in six steps. Smith tells a series of stories about colorful characters and then tries to tie these people to Wynn. I didn't believe it for a minute. Too bad, because the truth would probably have been more interesting than this hatchet job"
5,A true story about today's Las Vegas,"(...) Steve Wynn is truly a fascinating guy and his story needs to be fully told to appreciate his diverse talents, ""associations,"" and background. Running Scared tells the brutal truth about a facinating Vegas character. Thank goodness the mob was run out of Vegas years ago!"
3,Informative and Thought Provoking,This is worth reading if you want learn biographical information and details about the subject's role in the development of Vegas. Cannot say whether this book makes me view Mr Wynn in a more or less favorable way. The author clearly tries to characterize Mr Wynn in an unflattering way. A necessary counter balancing to the carefully managed public image of the man. His achievements and contributions are clear. Overall the book and title are definitely sensationalized.
5,"If you're interested in one of two things, read this book","1. The rags-to-riches tale of a true-life David Copperfield: but one who was and is ruthless, positively scary in his determination.2. The story of what -- or who -- makes the casinos -- money machines for the corporations that own them -- run. This is a clearly written, dramatic, true-life thriller. If you're not pre-disposed, as many are, to admiring people in power -- just because they're in power -- you'll find much to confirm your worst suspicions here. Smith did his work carefully, whatever those other reviewers say. I can't believe we read the same book. Read this; it's better than a million novels."
4,Fascinating Read,"I'm not sure how true all of the ""accusations"" / ""observations"" are about the infamous Mr. Wynn, but the book is extremely well written. Paired with the ""Green Felt Jungle"" (another excellent book) you will be hard-pressed to put these two books down. I would recommend this book to everyone."
1,Don't waste your time,Collection of conjecture that was at times painful to read. The recent Mirage annual report gives a better perspective of Wynn's gaming empire and how it was built.
5,Incredible learning and analysis,"This is a great and eye-opening book that reminds us about much of what is important in life. Really we shouldn't have to be reminded of how many riches life showers upon us, because we all can remember that our parents and grandparents lived much less abundant lives than we do. But people have a tendency to focus on the negative, even when the positive is right there in front of them. That's the great thing about reading this book -- it makes you happy to be alive rather than depressed. It has a huge amount of information and ideas that pop back into your head after you put the book down. And it's very funny -- really I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,good read,"I really enjoyed this book. The writing is engaging and the thesis is well thought out. He presents copious amounts of evidence to back his assertions. Some very debatable, to be sure, but that's a given.This is the type of book I really like...it actually left me feeling hopeful, so that's a good thing."
3,"Fact filled, but bring a big dictionary","The author does a great job at making his point, showing statistically how things have changed over many generations, but yet life has not necessarily improved. My big nit with this book though is that the author couldn't possible write like he talks; if he did, few would understand him. I find too often that non-fiction writers go for the gusto when trying to flower up their work with words requiring a dictionary to understand; this author did just that. I felt the author could have used a lighter and more humorous prose to get his points across, but instead made the book a klunky read. In all though, this book serves as a great wake-up call to those caught on life's treadmill, wondering what in the heck they're running toward."
5,un/progress with an interesting message,"This audio is entertaining and informative even though many of the conclusions are negative. The author looks at three decades of research that shows almost all aspects of Western life have vastly improved, but most men and women feel less happy than in the past. The Progress Paradox explores the reasons why ever-higher living standards don't seem to make us any happier. He also looks at humanistic ""positive psychology,"" which seeks to understand what causes a person's sense of well-being. Easterbrook makes a compelling case that optimism, gratitude, and acts of forgiveness not only make modern life more fulfilling but are definitely in our self-interest."
5,Good stuff,"Really good book, but then again, I am an avid reader of his TMQ column for ESPN Page 2. Book arrived quickly and in excellent condition, my compliments to the seller."
5,The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse,One of the best books I have ever read. Would recommend it to everyone.
1,Like facts? Look elsewhere.,"I began this book with high hopes, having enjoyed similar books (such as Malcolm Gladwell's ""The Tipping Point"") tremendously. But after the first two chapters, it became increasingly apparent that what I'd thought would be an objective consideration of middle-class discontent was simply an opportunity for Easterbrook to scold readers (and society at large) for their collective ability to stay on the sunny side.For an example of the logic you'll encounter in the book, consider this gem: at one point, Easterbrook argues that elderly Americans have no right to complain about the high cost of prescription drugs; after all, if those drugs didn't exist, seniors wouldn't be alive to complain.If you find this a compelling argument, you'll probably enjoy the book. If not, save your time for a more worthwhile read."
5,Even-handed look at where we were and where we've come,"Easterbrook shows the disparity between our collective societal unhappiness and contrasts it with how much better we really have it now. His take appears unclouded by either conservative or liberal agendas. The reader walks away unsure of his politics, but uplifted by the true progress our society has achieved."
2,Disappointing!,"Quite repetitive. After the first dozen pages or so I get the point. But his solutions to our malaise are a bit over the edge. He would like to see corporate executive remuneration be significantly less, he would like to see more forgiveness between people, and he would like gross environmental effects addressed. How much of that can the individuals who read his book address. Not very much, I'm afraid. He did such a wonderful job with A MOMENT ON THE EARTH, and compared to that, this is such a disappointment."
4,Book Quality,The book was in good physical condition. However there was quite a bit of underlining and highlighting. I didn't see that in the original description of the project. The book is still readable and is fine overall. Arrived far before the expected delivery date.
1,A Most Misleading Book,"This is a most misleading book. Contrary to what Easterbrook says, the economic state of middle America is not so rosy. Jobs are this country's leading export. Wages relative to inflation are stagnant at best for most folks who are not in white collar occupations. Even for white collar workers, the economic climate is not so good.Essentially, Easterbrook's book is a prosecutor's brief on the side of raising taxes. He claims that even though most Americans are now better off than they ever have been, they are really miserable. Easterbrook claims that what's needed is a big tax increase to fund the programs necessary to ""defeat global despair.""What Easterbrook has done, in essence, is to bend the facts to fit his predetermined agenda of advocating a big tax increase to fuel a big spending program. More and more big government is what he's really interested in, not in healing the wounds of the middle class."
2,A poor effort.,"I was reading through this book for a while at the bookstore while I was waiting for my wife to find some travel books.If you're a fan of good writing, stay away from this one. Far away.The organization stinks, the style is very clumsy, and there are subtle contradictions all over the place. And the early chapters did not hold my interest.A weak publication."
5,Michael Doucet's Learn Cajun Fiddle - excellent!,"Being a life-long musician, I had decided to learn to play the fiddle and started with Michael Doucet's set of CD's.I find them easy to follow, but I suspect they may be a bit more challenging if you don't already play an instrument.He presents a song, starting at a rudimentary but essential version and builds on it. The nice thing is that it presents a level that is appropriate to begin rehearsing, or even performing, and offers countless variations that you can learn as you progress in skill level.I've been working on CD #1 for a couple weeks now and it's been fun ""catching-on""! I actually thought that this instrument would be more difficult than it is, at least in order to achieve the fundamental Cajun sounds, thanks to Michael's excellent instruction!I'd definitely recommend this instruction set :-)"
4,Nice Grooves,I like my house on the deeper side and this cd certainly filled that need. This CD has a nice groove to it and stays away from the cheese that I've found in other house. Certainly not a classic but pretty good none-the-less.
5,Yummy!,"I enjoy this product in lattes or capuccinos. It is a great way to start the day, and I love the ""fall"" feeling I get from the Pumpkin Spice flavor."
3,The Flying Corpse,"The Flying Corpse is as gripping as any of the best seller ""whodunits"" I have read. Author Tony James held my attention as he spun his tale of love, avarice, and murder most foul. Set in the Bronx Botanical Garden and the surrounding New York City area this story builds to a fevered pitch as cops, scientists, and academics race to stop a killer before he strikes again. James' sense of humor, his psychological awareness, social consciousness, and knowledge of both the human and geological history of New York City lend this book freshness and immediacy. Though it lacks high polish, The Flying Corpse shines as a quick, exhilarating reading experience. I look forward to reading more of this author's work."
1,"balck spark, white fire","i didn't like this book one bit. the auther should try reading a book called black spark white fire written by richard poe. richard poe is an outstanding author and wrote a masterpiece. Your book was just too weak and not strong enough to tell us your point of writing this book, Mr. george g.m. james!"
3,QUESTIONS RAISED,HOW could Aristotle write as many books contributed to him in one lifetime? (one of the questions raised in the text).e-mail me if anyone has the answer.
3,A book whose thought provoking potency lives on,"Any book that can render the kind of reaction by intellectuals and regular folk alike (e.g. the long list of reviews below) should be on everyone's reading list. Even in today's polemical culture of complaint, where people hide bad art and cheap sensational ideas behind political/ideological fads or automatic public reactions to their support or refutation, one must look at the thought provoking questions that this book arises- and the near automatic emotions that go with them. I read this book several years ago in college. Though I didn't particularly like the preachy style, it successfully started me on an intellectual journey through a plethora of authors of the past two centuries and a spiritual awakening. This book, I am reminded, has such power, because it raises more uncomfortable questions than it answers.(...........)"
5,Truth comes to light!,"Many will not accept what James has presented in his book. Even if one scoffs at the notion that Greek history (as we know it) was fabricated (or that much of it has been falsely attributed to them) since it was ""stolen"" from an already existing and thriving culture in Africa, simply look up the references that James provides. It was eye-opening to read about how the Greeks themselves praised the Africans!!As it was said in the movie, ""A Few Good Men"", if you want the truth, ask yourself, ""Can I handle the truth?""This book goes a long way toward restoring the greatness of Africa that has been attacked for centuries. James shows Africa, and Egypt (Kemit) in particular, for what it really is: the home of a great, thriving civilization, and not simly the home to bush people, uncivilized savages, and slaves."
3,Do Egyptologist Support This?,"Lets say Mary Lefkowitz has her shortcommings as far as her research and with some of her claims,and people saying that there were no Black Egyptians are wrong also. But to support George G.M James' overall claims, similarites and clear parralles between Egyptian philosophy and mathematics with that of the Greeks would have to be clearly demonstrated. This is where I would think that Egyptologist,even if they are Eurocentric,would still be familiar. So far I don't know of any Egyptologist who have supported James' claims. Also, I would assume that there are other Egyptian experts out there who aren't white or Eurocentric who could easily demonstrate these Egyptian and Greek paralles in philosophy and mathematics. I would think that anyone who has studied Egyptian mathematics for example, would be able to see how Pythogoras' teachings were identicle to what they've seen with Egyptian mathematics if it was really just a carbon copy of the Egyptian's as James says."
4,SETTLE DOWN LITTLE NEANDERTHAL,"Please Please don't get bent out of shape our caucazoid children, your parents are starting to wake up and realize who they are. Don't get mad because the slave is realizing he is a slave to your melanin lacking system of government around the world. Mr. James might not be exactly historically correct in his findings, but he did make a bunch of sound asleep slaves wake up and read other scholarly works by Walter Williams, Yosef Ben Jochanon, Anthony Browder etc... We need to ask was there any socrates, aristotle, jesus, and many other that existed in phsical form. Rememeber one of the main practices of the Willie lynch letter was to make the slave think a life of animal in servitude was a way of life, but what my caucazoid children tend to misundertand is that, nomatter what nature tends to return to the way. Including the caucazoid race itself that's the reason behiind your recessive genes and why your is going by any means neccesary to survive. HOTEP!!"
1,"Amusing but please, a serious work??","A work of unbelievable naivety, devoid of any credible academic standards. Derivative of a nineteenth century sub-culture based around mystical appropriations from masonic, Rosicrucianist and Theosophist sources, James has written a very bad book which has never been taken seriously by learned people.The errors in the book are just unbelievable. For instance, James claims (pp. 125-130) that Aristotle ""stole"" the great library of Alexandria. Hello! The library was founded *after* his death, as ANY first-year classicist knows. This is just but one example of a book filled with grave flaws and basic errors. I am surprised by the passion that it has evidently raised on these pages, as the book is looked upon as an amusing joke in academia - certainly nothing to get excited about and most definitely nothing to take seriously as a historical work!"
1,That the color of the skin has to do with spirituality?,I do not understand why some north-american people are deeply connected to the color of the skin -- as a big issue. It seams like they see everything in the world according to the color of the sky. How can that be possible? That spirituality has to do with the color of the skin? Why this people do not move on? Why they do not release the past? Are they understanding what the spirit's world really is?
1,Pseudo-History at it's best,"As a long time researcher of Masonic history it is clear where this work ""stole"" it's bad ideas--they are ultimately derived from Terrason's _Life of Sethos_ (although Jame's probably did NOT go back this far, his sources are some fictional Masonic works like _The Ancient Mysteries and Modern Masonry_). If you can get a copy of ""Sethos"" read the 1732 english edition (otherwise you'll have to read it in French).It is clearly fictional and largely an artifact of the post-Napoleonic Egyptian craze. Of course this was long before hieroglyphics were even translated. Anyone, even knowing a basic history of the ancient world, would have to be insane to take this seriously. It is completely transparent today as simple racism and a desperate need for self-esteem--at the expense of others. Thus the only thing ""classic"" about this is it is a classic document of pseudohistory and African-American racism."
4,stolen african legacy...,"Written more for the faithful of African Egypt than for the skeptic, well-written and full of information about the egyptian mystery system and the legacy stolen from Africa's Egypt. Even though it plunges blindly into history, the book is full of fresh ideas, ideas that are now being taken seriously by scholars of ancient Egypt."
1,Obsolete,"This book has been thoroughly debunked by an actual academic, Mary Lefkowitz in her book Not Out Of Africa - How ""Afrocentrism"" Became An Excuse To Teach Myth As History (A New Republic book) [Paperback"
3,A daring book by an African American scholar before his time,"I enjoyed this book a great deal because of its fearlessness in challenging what has been long considered the truth. The book would have been rated even higher, but the reading at times is dry due to it having been written so long ago. The author George G. M. James is considered by many to be the father of progressive Afrocentric literature. As a proffessor at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff James met plenty of resistance during that time in American history. Unfortunately James was mysteriously found dead a few years after this book was published."
3,There's absolutely nothing new under the sun...,"All knowledge orinates from the One & Only, Creator of All. Therefore, all The Credit, The Praise, The Honor and THe Glory belongs to 'GOD'. Its the intellectual evolution of the human being that discovers the Universal Laws of 'GOD'. History is simply one man's interpretation of past events (his-story). Whether one chooses to subscribe to it or not, really doesn't matter.I read this book many years ago. My only advise to those interested in this work/subject is don't simply read it, but study the book. Do some research for yourself. Review works of SCHOLARS of Ancient Egyptian culture/civilization and draw your own conclusions based on the data you've gathered. Then, when you share that knowledge with others, be able to cite the references from which you've drawn your conclusions.Peace & Blessings to All"
4,History from Another Viewpoint,As I am reading this book I will share with my sons so they can have a panoramic view of history. Thought provoking to say the least and very well written.
4,Very helpful to track multiple policies,"I discovered Version 1 in October. The program was very helpful in organizing and tracking the processing of individual claims through three insurance companies. With the information it provided I was able to recover a significant amount in overcharges. The response time seems to be rather slow, particularly moving through the main claim list. I recently upgraded to version 2.1. The conversion went smoothly. The new version has expanded capabilities which make tracking multiple insurances easier. Response to email from tech support is quick and helpful. I think some fine tuning still need to be done to work out some kinks. It is a good start to solve the challenge of tracking medical expenses and insurannce payments."
1,This book is Terrible!,"This book is terrible. It tells you how to do the easy things, but nothing more. For harder things, it constantly tells you what is possible to do, but not how to actually do it. I would definately pick up a copy of ""Advanced Renderman"" or ""The Renderman Companion"" instead of this book! If you have any graphics programming experience, this book will not help you."
5,Great makeup,"I've used the expensive stuff but this product is really really great. Let's your skin shine through, not to heavy..just right. I also bought the base and the darker color for summer. Great product"
4,Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Vol. 2 CD,"If you like the music from Cowboy Bebop and/or other stuff Yoko Kano has done then you'll like this CD.You will hear the songs in the tv show.The opening song of the show Rise and the ending song Living inside the shell,you get to hear the full length version of both.After listening to this CD and as you watch the GITS you'll reconize the songs.It's a good CD for GITS fans."
3,Expected better,"After watching ""Stand Alone Complex"" I really wanted to have the opening music. I had mistakenly though ""Rise"" on this album would be ""Rise"" from the title. I was wrong. The music is OK just not something I would listen to a lot. Now I have to start the hunt all over again and try and find the correct song ""Rise"". Wish me luck."
3,Kanno SAC vol. 2,"combination of alternative rock, hard rock, electronica, symphonic and other styles from popular anime series and films"
5,Toccante,"È assolutamente incredibile come l'autore di questa colonna sonora sia riuscito a dare vita a generi così diversi l'uno dall'altro, in grado di emettere, ad ogni brano, sensazioni forti e ogni volta nuove. Molto interessante, come per il primo CD, che si sia fatto uso di non solo inglese, ma anche altre lingue, ognuna in grado di dare un timbro del tutto particolare ad ogni pezzo. Degno di nota e del tutto inaspettato il risultato ottenuto con la miscela di italiano ed inglese di ""I can't be cool"".Un solo giudizio: da comprare subito, sia per gli amanti delle colonne sonore che non."
2,Don't be fooled,"The tech specs list this computer as having an NvidiaGF4MX. If you think you are getting a true GF4 think again. You aren't even getting a GF3. The GF4MX is just a GF2(!) that has been rebranded as a GF4""MX"".A true GF4 card is compatible with the latest standards, a GF4MX is not. If you plan on playing the latest games, look for a system with more up to date graphics. If you just play old games (or none at all) then the graphics will probably be fine for you."
4,Wide Screen is worth of the money!,"Even I hated those ""Switch to Mac"" commercials..I do love this 17"" imac. The wide screen is great! However I found couple dead pixels on the screen. Apple said it's inevitable. I am a UNIX user. The Darwin environment is great. Buy 17"".don't buy the 15""....you will love this machine."
3,Ups and downs,"I have a love hate thing going with Apple. I love their desktops and hate their notebooks (flimsy, slow, overpriced, grrr). My only complaint is that the support could be better. I've have been adding components (scanner, digital camera, plotter) onto my iMac and have had a lot of trouble getting the right drivers, compatible software etc... Apple Tech support has *not* been very supportive. Once I've dug up the right driver (be sure what you buy will work with a Mac!) things have gone okay, but Apple could be more help here. They keep refering me to the manufacturer of the part, and taking no blame. Considering their adds claim ""ease of use"" I would like to see some of that ease. But once it's up and running it's really sweet!"
3,"Looks well made, but no installation instructions.","OK, I am not the smartest person in the world, but here goes anyway.Pros: Product looks well made.Cons: No installation instructions. Wish I had known.The bed of my trailer is of treated 2x6, which means thickness is1.5 inches. Assuming I am making the right mounting decision, there is barely 1.5 inches between the top and bottom plates for the rear of the unit. For the front, there are 2 wing bolts, with a nut you hammer into the wood, either on top of the deck, or on the bottom. Bottom seems out of the question, since there is only 1.25 inch clearance, so it must be hammered into the top of the deck. But, what keeps the bolt from pulling out?Bottom line: Deciding whether to return the item, at additional expense to me, or to get decent mounting bolts and nuts from Lowe's and keep it.Decisions, decisions!!!!"
4,Give a little bit of love and you get it back,"""I believe"" that this woman is talented.""I believe"" is the best song on this album,also released as a single which was a gooddecision because it's a well- made songfor peace with a great refrain. The albumis a nice popsong- collection which showsthat Marcella is able to go her own wayafter Shakespears Sister. ""Jewel"", ""Art ofmelancholy"", ""I'm no angel"", ""You don't tellme everything"", ""Out of my mind"" and ""PrimaDonna"" are other highlights that point outMarcellas great voice and her musical talent.""Ain't nothing like the real thing"" is a duetwith Elton John. Although I miss Marcella incombination with Siobhan I respect her solo-work!"
5,Almost 20 years later and this is still FANTASTIC!,"Marcella Detroit has had a long and interesting career. Starting off with Eric Clapton and singing the blues, she transformed herself to one half of the goth pop duo Shakespears Sister. When Marcella parted ways with Shakespears Sister founder she followed up that successful act with Jewel. I Believe was the big hit off this record, but man so many of the tracks are smoking hot. Detroit, James Brown and I Want to Take you Higher are great jams; but it is the goth pop sound of Art of Melancholy that is my personal favorite. So much of our contemporary ""music"" is crap...Britney, Keisha, J-Lo, Beyonce, shouldn't be allowed to sing in the shower in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and get this cd/mp3 download."
5,A must-have for every trainer's library.,I've waited 15 years for a training/HRD text to do what this text does: Give a total comprehensive view of the practice of human resource development. It's a must-have for every training professional's library.
4,"awsome dvd ,stupid copy protection.","a must have for grapplers,along with Kimura are many greats,only thing ,that suked,was the copy right protection will not let this dvd play on some dvd players/ps2....but worked well on my computer."
3,Judo no Yondan,Exactly what I expected as far as knowing state of the art video equipment wasn't available during this time.I've seen one of Kimura Sensei old Black and White videos before but wanted more so I could play it over and over to learn and teach the techniques.The quality is fair and some techniques are repeated in slow-motion.
5,Beautiful,"For anyone just getting into Charlemagne P. this is a great place to start. Both of his electronic/drone and piano/strumming approaches are captured here in a beautiful mixture of shimmering tones and intricate resonance. The first and sixth pieces are electronic works building on simple tone combinations drawn out over time to create a very hypnotic and austere environment. A piece like this is interesting when listened to from one room to another. The piano pieces are clusters of his strumming style, with track two and track three being prelude parts to the whole that is track four. Altogether it sounds like ritual bells. Track five is a very quite and delicate interpretation of tracks two through four. The whole album has a very ritual vibe to it. Highly recommended!"
1,Ughh! Doesn't even deserve 1 star!,"This disc contains two electronic works and four piano works. Basically, Palestine creates overtones and other acoustic effects through repetition and drones. Some of these effects are interesting. However, all of these pieces carry on endlessly, with no change for the most part. There is no depth or substance here whatsoever. Musicianship is thrown out the window all together, and so not surprisingly the results are virtually unlistenable. You could listen to it as background music, but it would soon become irrating and would force you to shut it off. But there is nothing to hear anyways! In conclusion, this is just terrible. I've heard alot of bad music in my day, but this one might take the cake. Skip it or suffer the consequences."
3,Diagnosis needed...,"Aside from the ethical questions involved in the creation of this documentary, it actually proves to be of great interest, certainly to the psychologically -minded ones among us, as well as the viewer who can identify with the main ""character's"" obsession with, of all people, the actress Natalie Portman. The two documentarians, who instigated the cross country car trip, and who drove the impaired (for lack of a better word) young man from California to Boston in order to film him when he finally met the most important person in his life, have used him for their advancement, however only one of them is now alive to reap whatever benefits which may or may not come.The revelation of events on the trip will repulse and/or fascinate you, so be prepared for an extraordinary experience. Give particular attention to two of the 'participants'...the father and ""Elle""...both of them very subtly demonstrate, at least to my mind, perhaps the strangest ones of all!"
4,Awful Normal,"I agree 100% with Laura Killilea. She saw all the things I did. Indiana Jules was also right on target with the truth. And what Larry Looney said needed desperately to be said. How could anyone take on such a flippant attitude as a few on here have to call something so horrendous as what these ppl went through ""boring"". The only thing that I can add that they may not have noticed (it may not have been on here at the time)is that the amazon adds to the right of the reviews were for movies that are nothing more than child porn. I have the titles written down & will be contacting amazon about this. Oh how pervasive this SIN of selfishness is! It appears that amazon knows that pervos will be watching these films to find the weak spots of their victims. Anything for a buck."
2,ok,"I used this video when discussing victims rights and emotions. It was REALLY long with over and over again and took awhile to get to the actual ""meat"" of the video- the talk. Once there, it was good to see the interaction and the dynamic of this meeting."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I found this video to be VERY boring and slow-moving. The abuse that the women suffered pales greatly in comparisson to the other case histories I have heard about in videos and books, not saying it wasnt a serious offense and didnt effect her greatly, but it wasnt what I expected in a video that dealt solely with her 'recovery' and 'healing'. The documentary was very slow moving and choppy."
1,Yawn.,"Boring women put their boring lives on display, or not, maybe that's the problem, you really get no idea what so ever what these people are truly all about. It does seem that they pick apart and analyze the one bad event from their near-perfect vanilla lives until you just want to choke the TV. The daughters confront their childhood abuser, get no real answers, no revelations, no picture for a good portion (black screen --only sound).....and It clocks in with 75 minutes of lame, purposeless, tedium...they could barely fill........If you enjoyed Capturing The Friedman's fast pace and deep story telling than you will be disappointed with this film."
4,awful Normal,It is an awful shame that any person could watch the touching personal accounts of someones life and consider it to be boring or a yawner. I was a preditor and I now know how my actions can be carried by the victoms for so long. I never wanted to hurt anyone but I guess I ended up hurting everyone. There is nothing normal about hurting someone else. I was touched and moved by the story and the prosect of closure.
2,Their early work--raw and Joy Division-like,"This CD showcases ITN's very early work (in fact, it compiles several early EPs from the period 1983-85), and it's not what you'd expect if you're familiar with their trademark classically influenced sound. Instead, it's largely a rock album, in the vein of Joy Division or perhaps a slightly less morose early Death in June. But you can hear certain elements that would later make their way into the trademark ITN sound, namely, their sense of the dramatic and their use of military snare. Some tracks really shine (the terse ""Mystery"" and the ethereal ""And Your Eyes""), but ""Prelude"" is really more of a historical document than a true ITN album."
3,A Good startup Guide,I recommend this book to gain greater insights in the Music business. It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals I purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit.
5,Best (only?) cat butt stickers around!,"If you have 'cat person' friends.....this is a hit!Cat butts seem to inspire hilarity in this group (ok, they're funny!)- and these stickers are nothing if not versatile!The possibilities are endless!"
1,Dire,"I'm a huge Reginald Hill fan, but this early book was nearly unreadable; it was just silly and over the top. I struggled to finish it and then wondered why I'd bothered. The Dalgliesh/Pascoe books are infinitely better, so don't waste your time with this one."
5,Great Slide Lesson,"Mike Dowling's lesson, Bottleneck Blues & Beyond is an excellent slide DVD. Dowling uses many of his songs to teach a wide variety of bottleneck techniques. Dowling moves slowly through challenging sections and his teaching style makes his great music very accessable. Camera angles are outstanding and he does a great job of showing both right hand and left hand techniques. The song selection is first class and you will leave the lessons with a great grasp of bottleneck blues and excellent songs to play. I also highly recommend DVD 2."
2,Not Enough,"Although Downing is a wonderful guitar player, I didn't get the sense that he really tried to teach slide technique with this video. He presented some songs, and slide factored into the presentation, but his emphasis appeared to be on right hand technique. Perhaps I missed that in the product description, but I really was looking for more of an emphasis on slide."
4,The Stairs conjure the mood of the 60's,"I wish more people knew about this band. while they are nothing new, if you enjoy the La's or even Cast and some early stones you will get a kick out of this. It is brilliantly executed material bordering on kitsch, but oh well so are the Verve. I think that this is a sorely overlooked gem. get it. JL"
4,Fridge thermostat,I am using this unit to control an old refrigerator with a broken internal thermostat for lagering beer. So far it has performed very well. I can hold temps within approx. 2 degrees F down to freezing. Couldn't be simpler to install. Note that the temperature dial indicator is very small and not precise... make sure you have a thermometer inside the frige to zero in on the desired temp if accuracy is important. Mine seemed to keep the temp about 2 degrees warmer than what is indicated on the dial.
4,Frig thermostat,Bought this to test converting a small chest freezer to a frig for my cabin. It arrived so fast I hadn't bought the freezer yet. Set up was easy and painless. Been running it for a few weeks and it seems to be keeping the temp within a couple degrees of the set temp ( I think it has a spread in the temp to keep it from cycling on and off). Would buy again.
2,Not that good,"This product works, but it kind of sucks too. The probe and coil are more rigid than I would like and seem like they might kink easy. The temperature dial on the unit is virtually meaningless. Using thermometers to test the dial's settings, I've found the dial to be very inaccurate. For example, if I want ambient air of 68 degrees, I have to set the dial to about 60-62. The unit also doesn't really work below 40 degrees, no matter how low a set the temperature dial. Personally, I would not buy this again, or recommend this product to anyone. You're better off spending a little extra money for a newer, better unit. I'm told the A419 works much better."
1,Dead on arrival,Our Dell PC wouldn't boot up with this DIMM installed. I'm going to try another brand of memory.
3,A good buy for the price,"I generally love Wrox books. They are generally the top of the list for working programmers. I bought this book, hoping to reduce the heft of my Reference Library of ASP 2.0. And, it failed.I am not saying that this is a bad book. For the price, it is hard to beat. But, the examples used are not nearly as real world as Professional Active Server Pages, and a lot is left out in the creation of data objects. Perhpas the publisher intends you to pick up the ADO reference also.If you program ASP as a regular part of your job, the charts at the back are nice and well worth the $19.99 suggested retail. But, do not throw away your books on database access or you will pull your hair out.In summary, this is a good book that should have been a great book."
4,Could be better!,"I wasn't expecting too much from this book when I bought it because it's suppose to be a programmers reference anyway. My problem is: instead of confusing new ASP programmers on database access, it's better to leave the topic to a better author, or say explicitly that samples will not work. I'm looking for a better book anyway!Please email me if you have any better suggestions."
3,Missing Survey of VBScript,"I usually really like Wrox books; along with O'Reilly I find that they are concise, timely, and accurate with their information. I bought this slim reference hoping to rid my desk my regular ASP book and clear up some needed real estate.Unfortunately, this book won't be replacing Professional ASP anytime soon. I know ASP VERY well, but I need syntax refreshers occasionally. This book will help with that for the most part, but it doesn't include a VBScript or JScript appendix. I know Wrox has other books for these topics, but an ASP programmer needs coverage of the scripting languages along with the ASP object model. Inclusion of a quick chapter would have made this book a four or 5 star for me. As is, maybe I can trade the book with one of my coworkers. :("
2,You won't learn more than 1 hour reading,"This book is clear and straightforward. Unfortunately, you won't learn much from it, for the examples are very simple and it never goes very deep inside programming. This definitely is a book for managers who want to get the feeling about a technology without having to write any code."
2,misleading........,"The sheet music I received was not the sheet music in the picture. The underline beneath the low voice denotes that it is a low voice version, so I assumed the idem I was getting was the low voice version. When it arrived I was surprised to see the version that was sent was the high voice version, which i cant sing. The picture posted is wrong and misleading and should be changed if the seller truly intends to only sell the high voice version."
2,Not satisfy,I did not enjoy enough this CD since it has a lot of explanations and very few vocal exercises.
5,Sing Song Winner,"I remember this song when I jumped rope, and now it has a new meaning for me. This book is one of my daughters' favorite books. The sing-song format and pictures help them remember the words, and they like to 'read' it to each other and anyone who will listen. They think it is silly and fun, but I think it is empowering because they can do it themselves and pure magic!"
2,Kindel Version,This is one of my favorite books but once again very disappointed with the Kindle version. Very poor job scanning and optimizing pictures. Any beginner photoshop student could have done a better job.
5,The Lady With The Alligator Purse,"This is a great book! This ryhming book is fun. It is easy to remember the words. Encourages speach and memory. FUN, FUN, FUN!"
2,good story but too short,This is a cute story with great characters and drawings but it's way too short of a story.I would not have bought it if I had realized that it's only a couple of pages long.
5,Solve Everything With Pizza!,"Don't you wish you could solve everything with pizza? The Lady with The Alligator Purse can! Parents may remember this as a song from their childhood, but the book brings laughter and a spark to the imagination for children ages 1-10. Not to mention that they will spend a little quiet time later trying to decide what made the baby think he could eat the bathtub!"
5,It was silly and funny and perfect for a very young child and much older nana.,"I was familiar with some of the rhyme but not all the verses. The pictures are charming, bright colored and pleasant. My granddaughter who is 4 years old laughed outloud at the picture of a baby trying to eat a bathtub ! It reminds me of the innocence of children but how ready they are to take on something new."
2,B Movie and a BAD Print,"This was an interesting B movie but the print used is really bad. Lighting levels jump from bright to so dark you cannot see the actors. In the first twenty minutes of the film almost every scene would run about 5 seconds and then start over again.Shemp Howard's part is over blown as he is only on camera for a few minutes but it was interesting to see him as a bad guy and not the Stooge I've always known him.There was an interesting set of scenes at the boardwalk showing some of the attractions from the mid-30's in Atlantic City, NJ. These and the other shots showing life at the resort city were the best reasons to watch this film."
1,Did NOT work in a Dell Inspiron 5000e,"I tried two of these babies; when the first one didn't work, I returned it (believing it to be defective) and asked for a replacement. When that one didn't work either, I then knew there had to be some basic compatibility problem with my Dell Inspiron 5000e, DESPITE the manufacturer's identification of this particular memory module as being the correct one for this computer. Needless to say, I'll NEVER buy any Edge Memory product again. I'll be trying a Viking 256MB SODIMM next. Wish me luck. By the way, Amazon was fantastic about handling all this; easy return, no hassle, very quick and efficient. Just the way I wish my new memory module(s) had worked!"
1,Memory for my Dell laptop,I added this card and every time I boot I get a new error message. I tried removing the existing 128 and just added the new one but the laptop didn't even start. Finally I returned it. I don't know whether it was a deffective piece or these just don't work with dell.
2,Only compatible with Apple iMac,"I ordered this product for my dell inspiron laptop. Turns out it was incompatible with my system and all I got was error messages. Afterwards, I researched the product number on edgememory.com and this chip is configured to be run on the Apple iMac."
1,DON'T DO IT!!,"I'm in the same boat as many of the other reviewers. Bought it, put it in & the laptop wouldn't boot up. Printed the FREE return label & got charged $5 for shipping it back. Very disappointing."
1,Phantom Memory,"Amazon continues to advertise this as ""IN STOCK"" at Ritz Camera. Ritz cancelled my order stating the manufacturer discontinued this item. Amazon was notified but over a month later they still have it listed as in stock at Ritz."
1,Defective Product,"***ATTENTION***Please be aware. I received this product in non-working condition. I did read a review previously on this, but did not take it to heart. Hindsight being 20/20, maybe I should have. I would not recommend this product. Spend the extra $15.00 per stick for a nationally branded product. I have returned this to the seller. I am waiting on my refund as of 3/29/09. Hopefully this information is useful to someone out there. Best of luck."
1,Frustrated,According to the specifications this memory should have worked with my Dell Inspiron. It was either bad ram or improperly marked. I tried it in two different computers and it would not work at all and actually caused the computer to crash in both instances. I would not buy from them again.
1,I was sent the wrong memory twice,I was sent the wrong memory twice and wasted two months and hours on the phone with customer service tech support who told me I was wrong.
1,Edge doesnotwork with dell 7500,I bought 2 of these.I can not even boot my computer Dell 7500 with these. Hope I can get a refund.
1,It didn't work.,"I purchased two of these memory sticks for use in an old Dell Inspiron 5000 laptop computer (Pentium III). The blurb suggested that they should be compatible with that machine. They were not! It would not even boot with them installed. I bought alternative units from another supplier, a bit more expensive and guaranteed to work in the Dell machine. They did! I suspect that there is nothing wrong with the Edge memory, the Dell is just picky - demanding a specific configuration or type of memory chips. I returned the Edge units to Amazon and they cheerfully returned my money. Thank you!"
3,Just what I needed.,"Had an old laptop to upgrade and found the RAM I needed on this site. Fast delivery, and it was exactly what I needed."
1,company shipped generic RAM; not the right item for a Gateway Solo 5300; needed low density;,A lot of hassle that could have been avoided if the shipper had done their homework. Couple of emails to Edgetek support cleared the matter up. And then RestockIt didn't want to take it back even though it was obvious that the information posted about the item was incomplete and misleading. RAM sellers need to be more exacting in their descriptions.
3,laptop memory,"The product arrived in new condition, unopened and as described. It didn't work in my laptop and I had to return it, which took some time to get my money back. But I did and I would buy from this seller again."
1,It did not work,"Sorry, But it did not work in my SONY PCR-R505ES. I have not emailed the shipper yet and I am sure they can HELP me with my purchase. I should have called or emailed the seller before I ordered this part."
5,A Spectacular Conclusion to the Jennie McGrady Series,"I am sorry to say that this is the final book of Patricia H. Rushford's Jennie McGrady series. Fortunately, these 15 novels are great for teenage Christian girls; I highly recommend them. Make sure to read them all!"
5,Lost it!,Ordered this book in preparation for my trip to San Francisco. Finally going to visit the haunts of the beat generation and this is the bible to get you there. Ended up leaving it in my room; before flying home. My loss. I'd buy it again.
5,Engaging Essays,"The 15 masterpieces are: 1. Defoe, Moll Flanders 2. Richardson, Clarissa 3. Fielding, Tom Jones 4. Sterne, Tristram Shandy 5. Austen, Emma 6. Thackeray, Vanity Fair 7. Eliot, The Mill on the Floss 8. Hardy, Far from the Madding Crowd 9. Conrad, Lord Jim 10. Bronte, Wuthering Heights 11. Dickens, Great Expectations 12. Lawrence, Women in Love 13. James, The Portrait of a Lady 14. Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man 15. Woolf, To the Lighthouse. These are not rough outlines for beginners but learned essays by a master teacher. Delightful and informative. Well worth reading."
1,Really is 512 MB,"For most applications, the fact that this card is really 512 MB rather than 128 MB would be a nice bonus.But, if you are buying such a small card for a device that can not handle larger cards, then it is bad. If I wanted 512 MB, I could easily buy a card labeled 512 MB, not one labeled 128 MB. For my application, the fact that it does not match its label is a fail."
4,Nice quality but small.,"I wish I had seen reviews before I bought these in October 08. VERY nice quality earrings, exactly as pictured, but much smaller and daintier than I thought. Very well suited for younger, pre-teen girls, or a woman with very short hair to show them off. My longer hair just hides them. But pretty earrings regardless, and nicely boxed with fast delivery."
2,worth getting only if you're a hardcore fan,"don't get me wrong. Failure ruled. Fantastic Planet is one of the best albums i own, and Magnified has some great tracks too. The fact is though,that at this point, failure just hadn't come into it's own yet. The band was just Greg Edwards and Ken Andrews back then and maybe the addition of Keli Scott really helped later, but i would only recommend this as a ""i need to have the first failure album"" thing."
2,A haiku review (Verbatim 16x DVD-R 4.7GB Discs (25-Spindle),"No more Verbatim--Seven coasters in spindle,on my G4 Mac."
5,so happy,I love rugrats and am so happy its finally on dvd! I just bought this and am very happy with it. Im not totally sure its in the right order though because in one episode chaz and kira own thier coffee shop and in another later on they are just starting it. And according to wikipedia all of season 8 are on here but some of them are actually supposed to be on season 9. I am a little confused to as to why this season is so much cheaper than the others.But over all i am just super happy to finally own it.
1,USLESS,This clock is of NO use. The alarm sound is so low you can hardly hear it. My daughter keeps it for looks as that is all it is good for. I had to get her another alarm that can be heard.
4,Yet Another Underrated Disney Live Action Comedy,"I thought this was an entertaining movie. It was not one of Disney's greatest, but it contained some truly amusing scenes. This is a far better film than many that Disney Studios was producing during the decade of the 70s. Some of the scenes were dumb, but lighten up, that's what makes it so enjoyable and funny. Tim Conway and Don Knotts are hilarious. Have a good laugh."
4,Wonderful kids movie!,"A wonderful kids movie! I've loved this movie since the day it was released, and I feel it's still a cut above the current crop of movies being marketed to kids.Enjoy!"
5,Priceless Comedy,Lighthearted fun with Tim Conway and Don Knotts. A barrel of laughs for those who love comedy.
1,The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again,"This movie lacked creativity in so many elements. It was just silly, unfortunately without being very funny. I haven't seen the first one but this one was quite disappointing."
5,"Funny, Family Movie","This is a funny video in the traditional 'old Disney' Don Knotts style. It is not as funny and does not have near as good a plot as ""The Apple Dumpling Game"". If you can only buy one, buy the first movie. This is old fashioned entertainment that the whole family can watch."
3,Was there a little bit missing in this movie?,"Whilst millions of people (and I am definately one of them) enjoy the brilliant comedy of Don Knotts and Tim Conway, I feel that there was a little bit missing between them in this movie, whereas in the original version of Apple Dumpling Gang the 'thing' was there all the time."
1,rocket gell-II,i will not buy anthing from footloker again the sent wrong shoes then diddnt send the right ones like they said they would
4,Excellent mixture of old and new styles,"Carol Noonan has always been an excellent folk artist, but here she really explores new styles as well. She can still sing more emotinally than just about anyone-especially on the traditional ""Queen Jane""--but also saves energy for ""Not Comming Home"", much more of a ""rock"" song than a folk ballad.For all the comparisons to Sandy Denny and Lorraina McKennit, I believe that shes an excellent modern singer-songwriter and performer in her own right. And its on ""The Only Witness"" where this can be seen most clearly."
5,Outstanding adventure fiction.,"I enjoyed this book as much or more than I have all of the other works by Mr. Smith in my collection. I never fail to be entertained by Mr' Smith's stunning character exposition, superb descriptive prose and edge-of-your-seat story lines. I could read a novel about paint drying by Mr. Smith and be thrilled to do so. Eye of the Tiger is an excellent read."
3,Close to Cussler but not quite there,"This was my first Wilbur Smith novel. It falls just short of the talent that Cussler has. While I'm not so disappointed that I won't read more of him, there's just something missing that I can't quite put my finger on. For instance, the treasure is supposed to have been there for ""a thousand years,"" yet the books states that the treasure sunk to the bottom about 300 years earlier.But anyway, I will seek out other books by him, so I can recommend this book as an entertaining one."
3,"Great book, but lots of typos","One of Smith's best, but three is a typo on almost every page very annoying when you pay 9$. You wonder why they don't make a little more effort spell checking."
3,A pretty decent tale of adventure,"First off, don't let the 3 star rating make you think that this book is no good, it's just that 4 stars to me has to have me thinking about the book for days afterwards and 5 stars is a book I cannot get out of my mind at all. If you are in the mood for a quick paced adventure book that has lots of fast action and violence to spare then you'll enjoy this book. The premise of a sunken treasure in the belly of an 18th century sunken ship makes for plenty of adventure and then some. I found the characters compelling enough without forming any real attachments to them but nonetheless interested in the outcome. This is my first Wilbur Smith novel and I would probably pick up another of his novels if I chanced across one. This book was definately written for pure adventure's sake. For that reason, any who live for these kinds of books should be happy with it."
3,my review,"The plot in this book is about a man who lives life quietly in a small island off the African Coast, in the Indian Ocean. He is suddenly jolted in the middle of a murder and forced to find a treasure to defend his life and his subsistence.The story is well thought out and keeps you interested throughout; it is also easy to follow. The characters and places are well presented. The ending is also a total surprise.Good easy reading."
3,Insert Tim Allen Grunt here,"Testosterone-fueled action-adventure treasure hunt. Stereotypical beach reading. Fun as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far."
4,Fun game- really keeps the tradition and gameplay of D&D,"I used to play D&D back when I was a teenager, and I was currently looking for a time wasting game for traveling that was turn based. Since Risk hasn't been rehashed, I decided to give it a shot. From what I remember about D&D, this game seems to follow the rules exactly. The graphics are good, and the game plays well. I dig it."
4,"Best PSP game so far, if you like D&D 3e.","The game is great, though it is extremely difficult to understand and play correctly because it is so rules heavy, and this limits the enjoyment for people who have no experience with the table top version of the game. The rules are implemented quite nicely. OTOH, if you know the rules prior to playing this you'll find it way too easy.It does lack important aspects of the game, such as random encounters and a possible ""automatic"" threat releveling for missions. Maybe in d&d; tactics II.Some things though make little sense. During missions you are permitted to rest and heal completely while standing outside the Boss' door!!!"
2,Boring,"I like RPG's, Dungeons and Dragons, and Tactics games; but I put this game down after about 15 minutes and haven't picked it back up.For one, if you want to roll your own characters, it will take you close to an hour before you even start playing the game. After that, I just don't find that the D&D; 3.5 ruleset makes for a good backdrop to make a tactics game. Furthermore, there is inclusion of some D&D; details that just distract from gameplay.I would be more inclined to think that the D&D; Miniatures franchise would be more suiting. Are you listening WoTC? ;)"
1,"The words ""let-down"" are not enough.","Now, I have never played tabletop D&D; and I am not a huge video game advocate either, but I was very stoked about getting this game. I love rpg's and strategy games so I assumed this would be an excellent buy. I tried, I really tried to like this game but the truth is, it's no fun. There was no enjoyment in playing this game. It felt like a chore, learning how to play and then generating characters was impossible. The game plays very slow and I couldn't quite get the ""hang' of the controls. I only played the game one time and now it sits in it's original box in my closet. I wonder if I'll ever try it again. I prolly won't I can still vividly remember the onslaught of extreme depression when I played; Like I'd never be happy again. Please don't buy this game. Save yourself some good time and money. I would only recommend this game is you were masochistic and hated yourself.Your Friend,Sleek Mouse"
2,Horrible interface hobbles a good game.,"It took me a long time to get into this game. The first time I played it I became frustrated trying to move equipment around between characters. The interface is the worst I've ever seen in a video game. Once you learn how to work around the shortcomings of the interface, you'll find an enjoyable and fairly challenging strategy game.This game is probably strictly for D&D; players, though. You won't find any spell descriptions in the instruction manual, you'll need to pull out your Players Handbook, which the game stays true to for the most part.I recommend this game for D&D; fans who like strategy RPGs."
3,Game keeps crashing,"I bought this game for my husband as a gift. He absolutely loves it and plays it almost everyday. However, I am so incredibly disappointed with the glitches. The game keeps crashing in the same spots. There is one particular mission that he tried to play 3 times and each time it would crash at the same place. He gave up on that mission, played a few more and then it happened again somewhere else in the game. We've tried to contact Atari but they haven't responded yet (it's been over a week). I feel like it would have been a great game, but it's certainly not worth the money as is."
4,Pretty Fun!,"This game is overall a fun game,its hard but easier if you know the D and D rules,most parts of the game are fun and challenging;its also neat that you can make your own character,or your whole party if you want.Its cool they have all the races and classes(and 2 new ones!)normally DnD games have like 4 races and 2 classes or something.I think it would be really cool to have it on the Nintendo DS though,thou id really rather play the good old pen and paper table top Dungeons and Dragons,but DnD Tactic is fun for fueling your Dungeons and Dragons rush any time and any were on the go."
1,A four star review needs to be answered,"One star is generous, and that only because the DVD was cheap--they would cut to reenactors doing their lanquid, Sunday-picnic interpretations of a Civil War battle. No real battle analysis and no terrain maps or troop dispositions. No sense of the battle, how it was engaged, how it developed and how it earned Lincoln's 256 words. Unless you were an extra, and vanity compels you to own this product, save your $."
2,Battle of Gettysburg,"Just a collage of prints, photo's and narrative. Basic info of the battle and few of the major leaders. Not very impressive or informative."
3,Does what I got it for but:,I got them so I could hear the TV episodes more clearly and mute the speakers to reduce disturbing others and they do that. But sound quality is reduced by some popping and crackling noise in the back ground at times and I'm sitting in front of the set and only 6-8 feet away. From reviews I read on other similar products before choosing these they seemed the best I could get.
4,Great Marriage Saver,Easy to use...just put on and they turn on automatically. Drop into the cradle to charge.Easy to connect. Plug power supply into the wall and two cables into the audio out jacks of the tv.
3,"Nice Headphones, but they didn't work on my Sony HDTV!","These headphones felt great, and looked like they were very nicely built. However, like a few other reviewers, they did not work with my Sony HDTV. Silence is the best way to describe what I heard with them! The transmitter light would not illuminate. Too bad the ad for this item didn't state that they would not work with (some or all?) HDTVs.I am reluctant to give a negative review on something that didn't work at all. Consider this review to be netural. Was it defective, or would it simply not work with a HDTV? The important thing here is that a refund was promptly provided. That's what I like about Amazon.com - the no-hassle refunds for items that either don't work or are not as advertised.Based on my experienc, I can't recommend them for use on a HDTV. They may work perfectly well on older analog TVs."
1,can't get rid of the hum,"First time we tried them there was this constant hum, even standing right next to the tv. Returned them the next day.Sony MDRRF925RK Wireless Headphone"
1,Still trying,I can't seem to make these work & am frustrated. I suspect it's something I'm doing or not doing & will figure it out on a day when I'm more patient.
1,"Had a problem, returned 2 units","The first unit I received I had to return because it kept cutting out. When the sound was good it was very good, but the cutting out was a big probem. I was sent a replacement with the same problem. Finally returned the unit for a refund."
5,Earphonic,"So far, so good. Easy to set up, very good sound. If you're hard of hearing, as I am, this is the produce for you. O, by the way, it's well worth the little money it costs."
2,Popping and hissing,"I bought this because my significant other goes to bed earlier than I do, and the TV keeps them awake. At first it was a great idea, but once I got the product it was not what was expected - the only real problem that I have with this product is that when using almost all the time I get popping and hissing while watching TV. The auto on/off was a great idea, they were fairly comfortable, and had no issues with charging (though I have only had for a few days), they will be going back sometime this week due to sound quality.My advice - if popping and hissing will bug you - DON'T BUY, if that wont bother you, go for it."
3,Not what I expected,"These are not what I expected, my dad has a pair but there are the all black ones and they are awesome, these have alot of static and unless i am five feet in front of the TV they get static, Next time I will buy a different pair, The price was right though and I believe that I got my moneys worth."
1,"QUIT WORKING, workmanship defects.","Green power indicator flickered briefly when plugging in power adapter connector, but would not stay on.Removed cover and immediately saw that all the hand soldered joints for the connectors and channel selector switch were defective. They were dull gray with a globular pear-shaped appearance. A properly soldered joint will be bright and shiny conforming to the shape of the elements soldered with concave fillets. To acheive a satisfactory solder connection all elements of a solder joint must reach the melting point of solder, not just have a droplet of solder applied.This was an easy fix for me having thirty plus years experience in manufacturing electronics. BUT - a new item requiring repair is completely unsatisfactory.SONY CLEARLY HAS WORKMANSHIP, TRAINING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROBLEMS."
4,"slight static, although on of the best investments I have made.","I am very pleased with the product. It has great responce in all frequencies. Even thought the Bass is not as clear and full as others, it makes up for it in other parts or Hz. with the exception clarity. I understand that it operates on the primace of that like a 900mz cordless phone, I do have a occasion problem with the reception being just 10 feet away from the sender. Although with a slight shift of the head or the headset it seems to take care of that. The one thin I am really bothered about is that it was not adaptable to RCA out from stereo to adapt to the apply to the headphone jack. This could allow us to keep the base unit closer to the user and not have to constantly get up an plug or unplug the unit when we wanted to use it, thus it would be always in reach.Thanks Tim Mosley"
4,great wireless headphones,"These work great and seem to have a good range. They are a bit big (and so is the charger), so you look a bit retro while wearing them, but if looks aren't a concern then I recommend purchasing these headphones."
4,Work great,Love these headphones. They work great and sound very clear. I got them for my husband so he could watch movies and play video games at night when I'm asleep and I dont get woken up and he can still listen to them loud. We both love them.
1,Keep the box handy!,"The ergonomics are great, the way it recharges is very advanced, BUT it just didn't work. There was a card on the unit advising to turn up the volume so it didn't auto turn off but it had in my opinion a defect that let it pop in the middle of listening. The duration was about .5 seconds which is a long time."
4,Good Buy,Very Good Headphones for the price. Good sound and great range. Work great in my Dorm room allowing me to move around while still listening to my music.
3,Mixed feelings,"I have always been a Sony fan. On this item I have mixed feelings. I cannot say I enjoy the headset completely. They seem to catch quite a lot of interference. I tried adjusting the output volume of the TV unsuccessfully. But I must say, probably it is not just the phones. My wireless phone, the internet modem, a wireless mouse and my wireless router are all located nearby without any possibility to place the headphone's transmitter far from all those devices. I don't know if that is the cause.The headset is very comfortable to wear and I use them frequently but the interference is a little bit annoying."
1,Very Disappointing-- Waste of Money,"Finally got the heavy duty static worked out. For those of you still struggling with this, turn the volume on the device you're connecting to up to full blast and then play the headphones at a low volume. The loud popping has to do with the auto on/off feature. I got around the auto on/off feature by twist-tying the adjustable headband to the upper band. Put the twist tie on for on, and remove it for off. Of course that made the headphones only able to fit the Incredible Hulk. The headphones were big to begin with, which is why the auto on/off feature was activated every time you moved your head, frequently cutting out and making listening in any position but stock still an impossibility. If you have a very large head and a full head of hair, and twist ties at the ready, these might work out for you. If you're a normal person who doesn't want to re-engineer a product to make it usable, pass on these. A total waste of money."
2,"Could have been great, but...","It would have been great had it not popped / buzzed even with the TV turned off. It definitely blocked out all outside noises, but the inside noises were distracting and never quit no matter what I did to try and get them to stop."
2,"terrible signal, hissing","lots of positive reviews on these is what triggered my decision to buy them. i tested several different positions, all channels, power sources, audio cables to no avail. i decided to give the sennheiser RS120's a try and have had a much better experience with them. they sit more comfortably on my ears as well, charging is easier (you just drape them over the metal bar.. no need for positioning).. highly recommended. one thing i do like about the sony's is that they power off when there is no signal."
2,Quit working,"They have already quit working. I had them resting on my knee and they fell to the floor less than two feet. They have not worked since. I could understand if they had been dropped repeatedly, but I would have expected more from Sony."
1,Sony blew it with the MDR line,"This is the second set of headphones I've tried in the Sony MDR line, as I previously tried their 970RK model and sent them back for a refund due to distorted audio. Thinking I just got a bad pair, I tried another set, the 925RK. Same result. The audio is distorted across the entire frequency spectrum and has a 'hallow' sound (that I might be able to live with without the distortion). I doubt I got a second defective set, though it is possible. I think it more likely Sony blew it with their MDR line. How these headphones got so many positive reviews I can only attribute to my experience with high-end audio equipment and having a more critical ear. However, they are distorted so bad that even the average user should notice."
4,Excellent for enjoying your music/movies,"I have this hooked up in my main living room, and it's connected to my Television set. I bought this because I watch tv late night and other people in the house were complaing that they could not sleep as they could hear the tv. Everything about this product is great.Just one down side. If you are watching a movie, take breaks with the headset, as it heats up your ears. Also clean the ear peice as sweat builds up. It does get hot."
5,griff,the headphones are great day really met my needs they worship timely and received in a good condition now I can watch programs at the volume I enjoy
5,Sanity savers!,"My husband is almost deaf and watches a lot of television. I do not. He would keep the volumn up loud enough to wake the dead. Self preservation lead me to buy the Sony headphones. Once again, peace reigns in the Cooke household."
1,Does not work,"Purchased for a friend , she said the headphones appear to charge but one she puts them on all she hears is static!"
4,"Works with a little static, but....","...they sound pretty good, and best of all I don't have to jog the volume up and down to hear the movie without disturbing the daytime people. But be aware - it's 900hz stereo/analog and there is some static esp if you're trying to surf the net while watching TV."
1,Ear phones,"Did not work. Did not have the correct cables for connecting to my new TV. After buying the correct cables, it still didn't work."
2,look for something else,"Noise, pops, crackles, hiss, sound levels vary based on input levels, in other words the sound is not constant, volume goes up and down (especially with musical inputs i.e. drums or guitars when practicing)...I guess one cannot expect much more for 50 bucks and wireless...? stick with wired headphones, I went back."
4,Works Great,"Love these, only problem is a bit of static once in a while but they work well.Three more words."
1,Poor Quality Sound - Poor Range,"I purchased these to replace my old Advent wireless headphones, but these had poor quality sound, lots of hiss that could not be tuned out, and the signal reception was very bad, even within the same room. They were returned."
2,Waste of time,Its not simple and couldnt get the sound only noise tried every posiible channel and always noise never sound .
3,part missing,the part that hooks it up to the fv is missing but i have no phone # to call and let then know
3,Good for most applications,"The MDR-RF925RK headphones worked really well with my Ipod and another stereo I tried (better than I expected!) but they had trouble with the TASCAM 2488 digital recorder that I wanted to use them with. The recorder is an 24 track ""digital studio"" that I use for recording instruments (guitars mostly). I wanted the wireless connection so I could roam freely while playing and recording the guitars. But for some reason the headphones have a lot of noise when used in combination with the recorder. I may try the infrared type."
3,Not bad for the price.,I got these so I could watch movies and tv without waking up the room mates. The only problem is if you turn your head while watching you get loud static. This is with the receiver less than 15 feet away. On the plus side when there isn't static the sound quality is very good and the headphones are very comfortable.
1,Don't Even Try,"Even though I read some of the bad reviews, I thought that it will not happen to me so I went ahead and ordered it.There are so many bad things with it that I don't know where to begin. First of all, there is no way to adjust theheadphones so it will fit a little tighter on my head. I have to be careful and move slowly to prevent them fromfalling off. Also when I was sitting on my sofa watching TV, the sound went away if I turn my head to the left orto the right. In addition, there was a lot of static. I returned them after 1 week and I bought the IR Sonyheadphones instead. Those at least lasted for 1 year before they died, but at least I got good sound and reliabilityfor as long as they lasted. It may be a problem with RF against IR, but for me so far I stay with IR."
2,Popping noise,Intermittent popping noise is very annoying. Not sure if the problem exists with all the other headphones. Some reviews mentioned this noise but I purchased it as the overall rating was good.
2,Sony MDR-RF925RK Wireless Headphone-purchase/result,"I bought this item for private wireless TV listening and stero listening. Results are: I unpack item from box, read all directions, plug unit in for 16 hr battery chg and the result was- 24hrs later charger never shut off (should shut off 16 hrs), I unplug it! I put earphones on and transmitter did not turn on, I unplug it- replug it- unpluged it and repluged to get it to work. The ear phones had static interference and I could not eliminate that. It did not work! I returned it- thanks Amazon. I've been buying Sony items since 1960- Sony has always been a top of the line product line for me, I'm very disappointed in Sony- this item is not worth $10 let alone the $80 retail price. Thanks...DJ"
3,Disappointing Headphones,"I own lots of Sony products; this one however, was disappointing. Sound quality is sub-standard, lots of cracking and weird noises which expodentially increases with distance from sound source. Apparentally, analog wireless headphones isn't the way to go. This is one of the few Sony products that I do not recommend."
2,Way bigger than they look,"These things are much bigger than the pictures would have you believe. Even with the inside strap they are too big for someone as microcephalic as I am. They are very heavy so they slide down if the cross piece is not sitting on your head. In addition to that, there is a fair amount of static. I will try to return them and go for a smaller pair."
3,Great except for static,"My wife once gave me a nice set of wireless headphones. With great reluctance, I finally returned them because they were very sensitive to static. Some ten years (and several new frequency ranges) later I tried again with these Sony headphones, hoping for the best. I've been using them for almost a year now.They are comfortable, sound great, block outside noise, and don't intrude on others. They would be perfect except they have the same static problem. Sitting on the couch, only 12 feet from the transmitter, the sound is interrupted by a burst of static whenever I move slightly. It is possible to stay in a sweet spot if I keep my head absolutely still. Moving or rotating the transmitter base has been no help; nor has changing the transmission frequency.Perhaps there is a simple solution (turn off my computer?) but for now, I'm wishing these came with a cord."
4,Works Well Just What I Needed!,This is exactly what I needed for my Spouse to use while I was sleeping in the early hours. She can watch what ever she would like with out disturbing me. Works well. Almost a great surround sound feel individually. Nice produce for the price!! Just a little buzz of static in low volumes...900mhz thats why!
4,Pretty good for the price,"I also have Sennheiser headphones and think that the sound quality was better with them but it had a defect (occasional very loud popping in one ear) and is currently in for warrantee repair. The Sony is a little too large for my head so tend to slip down when at their smallest setting and no, I don't have a particularly small head. I do like that these have a charger and it works just great as long as you pay attention that the charging light is on before you walk away. It sometimes requires a little adjustment to get them charging. I use these for TV viewing and they definitely help to make the words understandable. I don't watch a lot of TV so sometimes can go for several days before they need charging."
1,Poor Quality Product,"The first set I ordered and received worked fine for 2 days, then the volume control broke. Amazon gave me a return label and sent a replacement set within a week. The second set had no sound in the right ear. I called Amazon and was told that perhaps there was a problem with the manufacturer and to return both items for credit. Friends have this same headset, ordered 2 years ago, and it still works fine, so perhaps Sony has changed manufacturers. Don't waste your time or money."
5,RF Wireless Headphones,"This is my second pair of headphones. I m loosing the hearing in my right ear, so I use these to clarify speech. Watching TV is so much more pleasurable with these headphones and my husband doesn't have to tell me to turn down the sound because it's too loud. Love these earphones."
2,out of the box - did not work,"Purchased this item, received it and it did not work. Returned it, got replacement and it did not work either. Using either the rechargeable that came with it or fresh batteries, unit would not send signal to headset. Have received credit for both units and have bought another brand that works just fine."
2,Sony Ear Phones,I was really disappointed with this purchase as the unit does not amplify the signal enough and has to much static and with the volume turned up the battery drains much to quickly. I do not recommend this product for its cost.
2,Sorry to have purchased.,"First problem, the RCA adapter was missing that was supposed to be included. Second I was very dissapointed to hear a background hissing on all three channels. Whether I was one foot or several feet away the background noise was always there. I expected better from Sony."
4,work great!,As the wife who wants to fall asleep WITHOUT listening to the T.V. - I hightly recommend these headphones. I cannot hear a thing while my husband watches t.v. with these on!
2,Not that good,I'm sorry I bought this product. The sound is not that good and I keep hearing a cracking sound from time to time. I guess I'll have to live with it.
4,Great for hard of hearing,"These are for my 90-year-old Dad. The tv just isn't loud enough for him to hear and understand what's going on. He is very pleased with how these make the dialogue much clearer and enable him to enjoy tv again!I felt they were a little lacking in high end response, but they aren't for me!Rechargeable battery is a nice touch and the headband is the on-off switch so you can't forget to turn them off when you're through. Good value."
1,Sony MDR-RF925RK,Got this product based on the previous reviews. I have received model MDR-RF925RK which the product do function and comfortable but it has terrible loud hissing noise in the background once its connected to any 1 of the 3 available channels. I will not recommend this product to anyone at all.
2,Not up to Sony quality standards_Defective Switch,"After 2 days of use, the product is being returned. As others have pointed out, the quality of the automatic on/off switch is poorly made. The left side of the headband is more sensitive than the right causing a popping sound when it turns itself off and then on again, if you move your head or move to another room while wearing them. The range is limited. The headphones come with a pathetic 90-day warranty. Such a poor warranty demonstrates that Sony doesn't have much faith in its own product."
2,"Popping, Drop-outs, in line of sight 5'","These drop the audio occasionally and create popping sounds even 5' away with open air line of site to the transmitter. At 10' they're outright annoying as heck. Lousy for walking around the living room and kitchen. Very comfortable though. Built-in charger is real nice. BTW, I was using a Mackie headphone amp to adjust the audio level just right."
1,Very bad product,"After looking around a few weeks I decided to buy this wireless headphone.They spent two days at home and send them back to amazon. What a bad quality of sound !!! I could not even watch a film, listen to music or play any PS3 game because of the noise and interferences.Now I still want to buy a pair of headphones but I think I will stay away from wireless.PS. I am very satisfied with Amazon service, as they gave me a refund with no problems."
4,MUY BUENOS AUDIFONOS,"QUE BUENO QUE PUDE ADQUIRIR ESTOS AUDIFONOS QUE EN VENEZUELA SON DIFICILES DE CONSEGUIR, EL PRECIO EN AMAZON ES OTRO PUNTO A FAVOR, SI NO DESEAS GASTAR MAS DINERO POR UNOS AUDIFONOS ES MUY BUENA OPCION, SI PRESENTAN UN POCO DE ESTATICA PERO NADA PARA MORIRSE. CREO QUE PUEDES CONFIAR EN ESTA MARCA Y EN EL SEVICIO DE AMAZON."
1,Don't buy these,I bought a pair of these headphones. The base unit is faulty and turns itself off sometimes. The only way to get it to work is to unplug and replug it in every time I want to use it. The battery charger does not work well.
2,Noise!,"Even I exchange one time, but both have noise.Maybe there is noise electric from our neighbor, Water Company?"
2,No more,I have owned several of these as I have a hearing problem. This is the last time i will buy this model. Alot of clicking noises and has a short in it. Sound will go off for a minute then come back on and go back off again and again.
1,Poor Quality,"Very poor quality. A lot of irritating popping noises. The box had been opened and the operating instructions were missing. Ok I downloaded the op instructions,but it made me wonder if I had recieved a new unit or one that had been returned. I wouldn't think SONY would put out a product like this."
3,It's OK but not great.,"I needed a replacement for my previous Sony wireless headphones because the base went out on me and the 2 year warranty was over, had to buy another set of wireless headphones. I loved my previous Sony headphones so I decided to have a go with this one. The headphones are comfortable, but the sound is horrible. It's not very loud at all. Very disappointed on that. I use my previous Sony Wireless that aren't as cushiony and soft as these but the sound is 1000x better than the headphones it came with. It's a great buy if you don't care about the sound."
1,Head phones,"Received the headphones (HP) and put them on charge overnight. I then connected them to the TV in the ""audio out"" position and nothing happened; the TV was on, of course. So they now just sit there!!"
5,Good Headphone,"Satisfied and no comment at all, nice to have it. It's really good covering the whole portion of both ears and the sound is great."
1,sent w/ missing parts!,Was anxious to get this for an aging parent who was visiting and is hard of hearing. Imagine my disappointment when these wireless headphones arrived with the cords and was useless to me. I wish I could give this review a zero.
5,Well worth it.,"These headphones are worth the price.After reading 20-30 reviews,20 positive,10 negative ,I took a chance and purchased them.I am very satisfied with them.Occasionallyyou get a pop or a tiny hiss sound,but that's from moving your head.They fit fine,and are comfortable to wear.Would recommend them to anyone."
3,Great Product,"Product is great, but don't order it from Amazon.com if you want it quickly. They take FOREVER to ship."
3,Sony phones are a resounding OK,"After reading stacks of bad to absolutely horrid reviews after I bought these phones, I was truly worried. When they arrived, at my office, I immediately tried them. In that environment they were really unusable. So, I took them home with some real concerns. I hooked them up in my planned bedroom environment, and was surprised that they work fairly well. There is one position in which I get some interference, but mostly I get good sound. I am keeping the phones, but really would have wished for something that ""just"" works. That isn't too much to ask for, is it? Would I recommend these? No! There must be something that works better. These Sony phones are just too marginal. If there is nothing better, then I would look for IR phones before buying these."
3,"Good Product, Slight Static, But good",This is a good product but sometimes if your listening to something that is not playing constant sound you will pick up the static when there is no sound. All and All if your not obsessed with absolutely perfect sound i say buy. The quality is good enough for me and I'm a little fussy myself.
5,So much Better than TV-Ears!!,"Having used TV-Ears off & on for several years, these new Sony headphones are so much better we wish we had them sooner.Easy to connect, easy to charge and no risk of getting your fingers shocked on charging stand. Can't say enough good things about them. They feel and sound great!!"
2,There must be something better...,"I purchased these headphones about two months ago and have used them extensively. They are nice in that I can now watch TV with my wife when before it was too frustrating an experience (she would continually turn the volume down to a point where I couldn't hear it).However, I am ready for something better. These headphones screw up way too much in response to certain sounds - particularly the spoken letter 's'. Any quiet moment in a movie that is broken by an 's' - someone saying the word ""sister"", for example, instead comes out of these headphones as a very loud, obnoxious POP. I can't take it anymore.I'll be giving these away free on craigslist as soon as I can find a better replacement that doesn't cost $300."
1,ughh these blow,"save your money, I bought this at rat shack. nothing but noise, especially with movies, with music you can hear static in the background and a couple blips that get louder. I thought it would get better once the battery got fully charged, but it didnt matter. I had bought the radio shack version of wireless (infrared) headphones and they were alot better. the only problem with those were, that you couldnt leave the room and if someone walked if front of your transmitter you would get static..... also if the dvd player is going you get feedback from the motor.maybe I'll just stick with the 15ft. cord"
2,Not as good as I hoped,"The Sony Wireless Headphone (MDRRF925RK)did not live up to my expectations. The headphone was not very comfortable and that has bothered me each time I have used it. The volume control was recessed too much for my taste, as it was not easy to use, while wearing the headphone. Also, there is the issue of popping and static that happened way too often.I do have several Sony products that I like a lot, but I would not recommend this set to a friend."
2,Popping noise,"Just bought these yesterday and disappointed to hear popping noise every 30 sec. Headphones are good quality, but will be returning back for refund due to popping noise.Sony should have better qualification of their products (otherwise, what is the point of SONY brand?)"
2,Pop Go the Headphones,"While using these headphones, I was plagued by frequent, brief popping sounds. Switching between the 3 channels had no effect. Otherwise sound was clear and static free. They were returned to Amazon who was extremely prompt in crediting my account. If looking for wireless headphones, check the Sennheiser RS-110 model which I have owned for a year and have been trouble free."
3,Sony 900MHZ Headphones,I like this product to a point. I tried using all 3 channels and have not been able to get rid of the popping sound that occurs occasionaly. This is annoying when trying to watch a movie. Also the charge time is very long. I know its a slow trickel charge but it takes over 18 hours to recharge after using for 1 hour.
1,"Just a Bad Bad Product,,,,,Stay away,, Keep your money","I bought this for a Christmas present for my spouse, so she could lay in bed and watch her late nite movies while I sleep...I had the right idea just the wrong product. Don't waste your time or money.. I sent this back and they did refund my money. The headphones charged once but never properly worked...SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ,,STAY AWAY FROM THIS."
1,VERY unhappy!,"Don't waste your time buying and trying for this product to work. It does not! I used to buy only SONY brand products. I guess now, that everything is made in China, you can't trust a well known brand any more."
5,Works Great!,"The headset works just as advertised, right out of the box. I certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anybody."
3,Sony headphones,"Use them on a daily basis. The only complaint that I have is a popping sound every once and a while. Didn't return in time, so that's on me"
4,Works better than other headphones I've tried,"I bought as a gift for my son. I have another just like it and it works quite a bit better than other models I've tried. I can hear it upstairs from TV located downstairs. I did discover, as did other customers, the switch that turns it on, activated by the tension on the headband, can move when head movements are excessive. I wear it with a hat when I'm moving around, that increases tension sufficiently and removes that annoying clicking sound."
1,These are very poor quality and sound,This came and I plugged it it. They never had good sound and they had lots of static. Look for something else.
4,Good and useful,"I use these to watch TV when family is asleep. It works well most of the time. Sometimes, one day out of week, there is too much statics, clicking and hissing. Most of the days it's totally fine. Definitely not location-related. More like the weather of position of the Mars.I wouldn't listen to hi-end audio in these, but for TV it works great. And recharger base is nice and easy to use."
2,Buzzing sound,"These have a buzzing sound unless you hold your head in exactly the right spot, which for me ended up being with my head turned to the right, kind of hard to watch tv that way. I tried to eliminate any kind of interference and nothing helped. Once you find the right spot to hold your head, you can't move it right or left or it will buzz.i did change the volume between the tv and headphones and that did help some but not enough to make these wearable."
5,Wireless headphone (BLESSING),I purchased the headset for my husband and I love it. I can listen to the tv at a normal tone.
3,I would'nt...Get the RF970RK instead,"Disappointed that this product has not improved in 40 years...same problem as my 1970's wirless 900mhz with constant hiss unless 3 feet or closer to the amp. I'm going to try the RF970RK model instead because it has auto-tune function...if that doesn't work I'll wait another 40 years to try out ""wireless headphones""...also, earpads are made of vinyl and cover the whole ear so that you sweat in winter weather...why doesn't Sony use higher quality materials for the earpad ..."
2,Too much noise.,"It has too much noise. Even I purchase noise filter and attached, it still has noise. There is 3 channel on it. All 3 channel has noise."
4,I'm very pleased with this headset.,"I am by no means an expert, but I really like this headset. I hooked it up to the audio out of my HDTV so I can listen to TV at night without distubing anyone. You can put the volume on the TV all the way down or even mute it, but the headphones still work as they have their own volume control. I like the way they automatically shut off when not in use to save battery life and they automatically come back on as soon as you put them on your head. Occasionally when I move my head I get a little static for maybe half a second but nothing too bad."
5,"Lovely book, lovely story","We've owned this book since my oldest daughter (who is now 12) was a toddler. It continues to be a family favorite, especially for reading aloud. It's one of the few stories that my 2 year old will listen to all the way through, he especially loves the echo element. This is a lovely story with lovely illustrations and I highly recommend it!"
4,Cute story,"This is a cute story about the echo across the lake. The story doesn't really explain what an echo is, but for my 3 year old it is a sweet story about a beaver who is looking for (and finds) some friends."
3,Only If You Love Venice...,"Mike Figgis makes a supersized attempt to be artsy in this meandering film. The problem is that the story is so flat because there is no one about whom we can care. After the first confusing messy thirty minutes (John Malkovich sitting behind prison bars at a dinner table for no apparent reason other than to offer insipid dialogue to an uncaring dinner guest list), I decided to just look at the screen for the color and the wild camera work. Venice looks great but the stodgy staging of 'The Duchess of Malfi' and the weak plot associated with it doesn't even begin to cover the creaks in this silly film. This one is only for the Figgis fans out there - and for Venice addicts who will put up with about anything to just 'feel' the Venetian glow. A Must Miss. Grady Harp, August 05"
1,Hotel Schmotel,"The description on the movie jacket is totally misleading. It is not thrilling and it is not terrifying. The only scene of Venice you will see is St. Mark's Square. All-star cast? Yup, and I suppose they made the best of it, but then if I was paid big bucks to spend some time in Venice I would too... A horrible movie! A waste of 1hr. 51minutes."
1,An Attempt to bring Arthouse Cinema into the Mainstream?,"Good try, but I doubt if this oneeven sat well with the Arthouse crowd.This movie is obnoxious and strange.I don't dislike it for that reasonalone. It's uneven, mostly boring, and hastoo much dialogue about absolutely nothing.The cinematography is dizzying (in an annoyingway) and the characters are flat corpses,even before they're killed.And where is all the alleged eroticism?With so much of nothing going on in thisfilm it would be very easy to miss (However,the ""Milk"" scene is definitely worthy ofan eyebrow raise).My biggest surprise is how in the worlddid they manage to get so many notableactors to appear in this horrible film.For Christ's sake, Burt Reynold pops upout of nowhere, and Lucy Liu even waltzesin towards the end.Don't let the hip casting fool you,this movie is a waste. In fact, I nominate""Hotel"" as the first movie on Amazon toreceive a negative rating."
1,hotel condemned,"The ""Special Features"" section said this movie had no script. That explains but doesn't excuse it."
1,flushable,"One of the most bizarre things about this film is the all star cast. How could they appear in this movie? It is one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. I am embarrassed for them. This move is not thrilling, not engaging, not entertaining. Boring. Imbecilic. This film is about as appealing as dog-do on my shoe. The jacket description is totally misleading. Thank God I got this one in the bargain box. $4.00 is still too much to pay for this. I pity anyone who has purchased this at Amazon's current price."
1,Pretentious rubbish!,"This is a badly filmed and scripted work. A bore infact. The actors are good enough. I suppose they do what they're told. They are not to blame. Whoever made this film though should be working in a bloody hotel, cleaning door handles or something. If you want to watch something good, then watch a Danish film."
4,Waitin' on you?!?,"This is Emerson Drive's latest single.It contains 2 tracks : Waintin' On Me and Rescued.Waitin' On Me is a very fun, up beat song. Wonderful fiddle playing on this one. Should of made it up the charts more than it did... I guess we will have to wait until the whole album gets released.Emerson Drive's next album should be coming out in the spring of 2004. The album was produced by Richard Marx.Hang on 2004, Emerson Drive will blow your mind!"
4,wow,"Absolutly 100% addictive! I read this book in 2 days! I could not put it down. It was very well written, and i would recemend it to anyone. Had a lot of things in the book that the movie did'nt. it was a great book. Very exciting and well thought out. Nice plot also"
5,Carrie,Stephen King has way of bringing a fictional book to life. He loves to scare a person. With Carrie the way he brings real live experienced into this book is wonderful. After you read this book you can see how this can happen in real life. The way Carrie learns to use her telekenetic powers are wonderful. She has a very religious fanatic for a mother how still believes in myths. Carrie is tormented and teased to the breaking point by her more popular schoolmates. They do find out how aperson can get back at them for the years that Carrie was tormented by this. I really did enjoy this book. It is not a scarey as some of his other books but just as good.
4,Short Sweet and to the point,"This book explores what most of us would have done if we had a special, explosive powers when we were in high school. King explores what all of us wish at some point we could have done to those who choose to taunt and bother us. This book is superbly written and keeps your interest to the quickly coming end. This is a great book to read for those who seem to have the misconception that most of what King writes is blood and gore. (which would include most people)"
2,sorry i know it is a classic but......um.........no,I thought it was a bland tasteless book with no debth. The only part I enjoyed was the crazy mother. Other than that it was not as good as many people think.
3,Like live and love,I am 13 so it was tough reading this book but it was a great start to the Stephen king collection!
5,It was intense and rivitting,Carrie showed no strength in the beginng. Due to the fact that her mother was a wack job and needed her own help. Thsi book was the best Stephern King book besides Misery and Dolorses Claiborne. I can't wait till he writes another book. Yipppee!!!
5,Amazing for a first book,"Carrie is King's first published book, and I think it's one of his best up to date, along with The Stand and The eyes of the dragon. Carrie is a very unique character. She grew up under the surveillance of a very religious and controling mother who believed that everything related to sex was demoniac. In that kind of environment, the kid couldn't be anything but kind of crazy herself. That would be fine, if she wasn't motive of laughter in the school, and if she hadn't one very special power: telekinetics. The book is very easy to read. The reader must pay attention to every detail, so one can fully understand the subtleties of the plot. For example, the name of the protagonist is Carrie (a carrier) White (the innocence). Very good for a first try. Congratulations, Mr King."
1,Predictable,"No one said Stephen King is a literary writer, andthis novel, like all his others, proves that pointaptly."
5,Carrie,"I've been one of Mr. King's ""Constant Readers"" for years. However, my reading of his tales began with Gerald's Game and, until this past year, I never read anything published before it.I now realize how unfortunate that was! The past few months have allowed me to rediscover Stephen King in an entirely new light. I finished Carrie this evening from my Kindle. (I've been THRILLED about all the classic King works popping up reguarly, as of late, in Kindle format. KEEP THEM COMING AMAZON!) While it hasn't been my favorite of the older works (Hey I read It and The Stand during this team; tough acts to follow to say the least!) it was an utterly captivating read. The printed version is some 200 pages, and it did feel such. It's a must read, for... well... anyone."
5,Carrie,"A classic horror story, in which the reader will feel both deep compassion for and great fear of the main character. Carrie will bring you back to those nightmarish times in high school when you felt like you just didn't fit in!"
2,Overrated novel with a great premise that was poorly executed,"Not as good as anticipated. The book was hard to get into. For the most part, it reads like a text book, with news articles that completely take you out of the story. There are too many of them and they interrupt the flow of the story, making it a real chore to read. The first scene is great, a classic scene, actually, but once it's over you are bombarded with the news articles. If I wanted to read so many news articles, I'd pick up the newspaper and have at it. I don't, that's why I picked up this novel. King uses the articles to tell the story instead of a normal narrative, sacrificing an enjoyable read.To put it bluntly, there are better Stephen King novels out there. I don't recommend newbs starting with this one. King had a great premise here but it wasn't executed well at all. A real shame, too. Anyone interested in this story might do well watching the movie instead, which was undoubtedly better."
4,One of my favorite Stephen King books!,"I first read Carrie when I was in junior high & I readily identified with her. I was not very popular and I had my share of abuse from classmates. The news articles confused me at first, but then they gave me further insight on what happened that fateful Prom Night. Anyone who has ever been left out or downtrodden will love Carrie! I highly recommend this book!"
4,His better one?,"I liked this one the most of all his novels and I've only read a few. The psychology of Carrie I found fascinating. Generally, I don't care for the genre."
4,Teenage Nerd Gets Revenge!,"An outcast teenager gets revenge on all of them who have tormented her. This theme really plays to our emotions.The ""nerd"" in this story is Carrie. She is mistreated by her mother and ridiculed by her classmates. When she discovers she has certain ""powers"" to make things happen, things start to get out of hand.This is a good, scary book that keeps you on the edge of your seat."
2,Where's the Scarey? Boring!,"I expected to get some chills, but this book never took off with any action. The blood/fire pieces played more like foot notes then anything chilling. The newspaper snips, and excerpts from the ""books"" detracted from the flow of the story. I was bored and couldn't wait for the book to end. This is the rare case where the movie was better than the book."
4,Nikki was here,"I think that Carrie was a very excellent book. However, I enjoyed the movie more than I enjoyed the book. Carrie's mother sounds terrifying. My favorite part of the book was when Carrie was at the prom. Right before Billy and Chris poured the blood on her. One reason why I liked this part of the book was because it was the only part of the book that Carrie actually felt like a person."
3,"I enjoyed this book, but it freaked me out!","This book is totally incredible. Even though you think things like this could never happen, King portrays the characters well enough to be believable.I recommend this book for anyone who has never read any of King's books or if they didn't like his other books. Personally, I think that this book wasthe most interesting to teenagers and easier to read than some of his other works."
4,A King classic!,"The story's old and the premis isn't exactly earth-moving but this classic from Stephen King is written in such a way that makes it seem timeless and brand new. Its really fantastic especially with the snippets from ""text"" about the book's event from after it happened. I really enjoyed this and would have loved to read it 20 years ago and I will still want to reread it 20 years from now. Good stuff!"
4,Blood bath (sorry for the bad pun),"Extremely strong character development and strong dialogue mark all of King's work and Carrie is no exception. King is a wonderful weaver of tales. When I read this book while in my teens, I was bored with it and just didn't get it. Reading it again as an adult, I can better see all of the inner turmoil that the characters are facing. It's also interesting how he breaks up the narrative with exerpts from real sounding commission reports, news stories and post-event accounts of the events of prom night. Truly a well written story of the terrible things that adolescents do to one another and what might happen if the right person is pushed past her threshold of tolerance."
3,obviously early in his career,"king's first book didn't show his real greatness. this is much more ""simple"" than his later works. we got a girl terrozised by her mother, teased by her schoolmates. however, it turns out she has powers. now there are some good psychological reflections, but not as great as the psychology in K's later works. some lovely details, not in so much depth as, yes, later. and K's writing style is much simpler here. not that it's bad, but it does not show K's greatness. but it's a good read, and not of his worst"
5,Super suspenceful!,"CARRIE is an absolute classic. It was the secound book by King that I ever read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I passed my information on to my good friends, who devoured it in a few days, and went on and on about it when they finished it. Carrie White is a seemingly innocent schoolgirl who is constantly tormented by her cruel peers and her strange mother. Carrie holds a power inside her that comes purely from anger and hate. Her mother, Margaret White, has a very strange view of Christianity...forcing Carrie to go into a small closet and pray for forgiveness after events as innocent and simple as her first period. Carrie finally gets a break when Tommy Ross asks her to go to the Prom. Little does she know that her hateful classmates are planning a surprise for her."
4,Awsome!,"This is an awsome book to read becuase it keeps you on the edge the whole time. Its about a young highschool girl who gets angrier and angrier everyday. All the kids at her school would do mean things to her all the time. They just kept getting worse. Little did she know she had telekinesis powers that could change the whole towns outlook forever. I can see why she did what she did. All the anger building up inside of her she was about to explode. Although it starts off a little slow, this book is definetly one of the scariest and most thrilling books I have ever read. I had never read a Stephen King book before this one, but I had always heard wonderful things about them. I started out just reading it because I had to for a book report. By the time I got all the way through it I was ready for more."
4,R.I.P. Carietta White,"Wow. What an amazing novel. This novel tells the tale of Carietta White, a high school loser who is tormented by her classmates and overzealously religous mother. In Carrie, Stephen King further develops his unique style of writing, using several mediums to convey the story: character thoughts offset in parentheses, hearing committee testimonies, associated press tickers and so on.King does a great job developing character and plot early in the novel, but what makes this work so strong is King's ability to make the most minor details relevant later in the story. Carrie isn't necessarily a horror, per se, rather a suspenseful thriller. Throughout the whole novel you're just waiting for Carrie to snap. King did a great job of keeping the level of tension taut as an overstretched drum. All in all, Carrie is a tough one to put down until you've turned the last page...and an eerie foreshadowing of the teenage vengeance prevailant in today's high school shootings."
5,True power in these pages,"I have recently read King's 11/22/63, and since I'm a writer myself (unpublished), I wanted to learn how to break the story up using newspaper clipings, parts from fictional books and such. So I turned to the one of the greatest classics, Carrie.I found Carrie's story to be more intense, brutal than the movie (but the movie wasn't bad as itself). Carrie is a fast paste book, no doubt, but it was very brilliantly written. I know King said it as ""A young book from a young author,"" but Carrie really shows King's true talent.For those who are thinking reading this book after watching the movie for God knows how many times, you must pick this book up. The story is a lot better (you get the chance to learn more about the White family), se the major differences between the book and the movie. It won't disappoint."
3,"Oddly peiced together... still, good plot","One of the few SK books that I didn't like. The plot was good, an abused teenage girl goes beserk on the fam and classmates when she figures out that she has ""super"" powers. However, i found it difficult to follow(with all of the newspaper clippings and court interviews, etc. The only really poignant and at the same time worthwhile was the final ""fight scene"" with the mother. Nonetheless, if you are a ""true"" SK fan, you should read this merely because it is ""the book that made him famous."""
3,Hmmm,"I'm not a great fan of King's early works--in fact I'm grateful I picked up his later stuff first; if I'd started with ""Carrie"" I wouldn't have stuck with him as long as I have. This book is a simple idea, simply executed, and simply concluded. No surprises here. Perhaps something good for early-or-pre-teen horror fans to cut their teeth on, but for anybody who's even looked at his later stuff, this doesn't hold anything new. (Maybe things are a lot more severe in America than the UK, but aren't King's teenagers a little ... well ... sociopathic? Psychotic? He makes High School sound like its run by a generation of neo-Nazis.)"
2,Another In A Slew Of King Books,Spooky chick has freaky mom. Spooky chick gets dissed in school. Spooky chick studies the occult. Spooky chick gets awesome powers. Spooky chick gets bucket of pig's blood dumped on her head. Spooky chick fights back--even from the grave. Very spooky. Boo!
3,King Raw and Uncensored.,"When reading this book I was struck by how similiar it was to seeing a young Micheal Jordan. In college Jordan possessed that amazing athletic ability that would make him an awe inspiring icon, but lacked the skill that would make him the greatest player ever(shooting and dribbling) King was the same way in Carrie he showed his gift for horror and the paranormal that would make him a best selling author many times over, but he lacked the things we would find in his later books like believable characters and subtelty. Overall the book is terrifying but lacks the fine tuning to make it a really good book. This book is not a complete book, its one dimensional."
2,Eh...,"I picked up this book, after reading Cujo, Christine, and 4 past midnight. However, this wasnt at all what i was expectingAlot of people have already said that it's more of a coming of age story. Well, the story was okay, but the writing wasn't very good, unlke his other books. This one kept going back and forth, between reports, people, and narratives. As well as confusing, it was boring.I personally dont like non-fiction writing, but alot of this was written as if it was.I would recomend it to anyone who enjoys the nonfiction style but also enjoys the supernatural."
1,The movie was better!,"I finished this book in just over 2 hours. The characters were undeveloped and the plot mediocre. It was my first Stephen King book, but I gave him another chance on The Shining. This book literally nearly bored me to sleep......."
1,Disapointing,The story is good but the style of writing he used is boring. I loved the movie version of Carrie but the book really isn't like any other King work I've ever read. He has definately improved since this earily work!!
4,A great novelist's great first effort,"Stephen King hits a home run in his very first published novel, ""Carrie"". He tells a believable story about a misfit girl with a supernatural gift and the horror that ensues when she's forced to put it to use."
3,Super Reader,"A girl is terrorised by her completely insane whackjob fundamentalist mother. This has caused her to be a sheltered, shattered wreck of a personality.She has telekinetic abilities, and that is one reason for her mother's horrific treatment of her. As a reclusive nerd type at an American high school she is not treated too well.When a prom night very cruel psychological and physical prank combination traumatises her, she has finally had enough."
4,Good but not his best...,Tense and really exciting. It makes you think twice before picking on someone. It is by far not his best book (IT is his best book) but it is fun to read. Definately not scary (unless you're a total whimp)but if you read Carrie you'll have a good time!
4,I love King's books but this one was not his best.,"""Carrie"" the book is not as good as the movie. I realize that this was his first novel, so I will cut him some slack! I just adored the movie and Sissy Spacek was wonderful. Carrie's mother and classmates pushed her to the limit and she showed them who was boss! Read all of his books!"
3,A Book too good to watch,This book is great. I had to do a movie review for school that was over 10 years old. I saw that Carrie 2 had came out and searched everywhere for the movie. And couldn't find. so IO picked up the book. I found that the book was awesome! I loved the detail it gave and really felt for Carrie. It was a great book.!
3,"Well, it was okay...","When I read this, for some reason, didn't find it very scary. Maybe it was because I didn't read it before bed. But I read Night Shift, and some of the stories in there scared me, like Jerusalem's Lot (really freaky) and I am the Doorway (which was just plain weird)."
5,One in a million,"Okay, I actually thought this wasn't scary. I found it a good read because I like reading about school rejects, and I like reading Stephen King. This is about a school reject with telekinisis and a super-religious mother. The ending is quite good though it didn't scare me a bit... now It... that was scary. Being that I'm a ten year old and that clown likes to eat children. By the way my name is Kelly."
5,Great novel,"This is King's debut novel and it is one of his best. Written during a period in which he was personally struggling, it displays that struggle in the character of Carrie. That's what I like about it."
5,Remember the Golden Rule...or Suffer The Consequences,"Since it has been nearly 20 years since I read many of Stephen King's books, I thought that it was probably time to start going back and re-reading some of them. I decided to start in chronological order with Carrie. Carrie is the story of an awkward teen that has been continually picked on her entire life and finally takes her revenge upon the world using long-dormant powers. In a sick sort of way you kind of root for her to take the entire town out. At any rate it is one of Stephen King's best stories with enough pulse-pounding anxiety to make you want to read the entire story in one sitting. Thankfully it is really short and you can easily burn through it in a few hours. A true masterpiece from the master of horror."
4,Carrie,"After reading Carrie I can see why it is a Steven King Classic. Carrie demonstrates the amazing description that King is known for, although it can sometimes be overwhelming. the writing style was unique but magnificent. This was obviously one of King's best works!"
5,Superb,"This is the first Stephen King that I've ever read and I must say that the book was superb. The book explores into the mind of Carrie, a misunderstood highschool girl. After Carrie notices that she can move objects using her mind, she looks into it and sees that she has telekeinetic powers. If you've seen the movie, read the book. It is 100 times better. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, read the book 1st. The movie will ruin the book. Although the book is not a horror novel, it is still a fascinating science fiction. This book will hook you with the explosive shower room scene. This is a great book for anybody that is looking for a good fast paced read. I'm only 12 and read it in 2 days it was so good. Read it, you won't be disappointed."
3,OK for my first horror read,"I've always hated horror movies so never thought I would care for Stephen King. Yes, the book has been around forever and I've just read it. I did not particularly care for the style of writing that jumped between various ""official reports"" and the main story line. In fact I almost put it down for that reason, but I kept reading, determined to finish my first horror novel. I don't plan for it to be my last, but I hope the style of future reads differs to my liking."
2,"Raw, dirty and very repulsive","I am not a big fan of Stephen King books, although I have only read three of this books. The first one I read was ""Carrie"". I saw the film, loved it, so gave the novel a try. I must say it`s difficult to get imagery from this book, and I did not find King`s use of words powerful or frightening at all. They were too raw and unpleasantly accurate to intrigue me. But what really aggravated me about ""Carrie"" is the way King constructed newspaper articles, obituaries, and interviews into the story. It totally weakened the plot, and it sort of got confusing at times. Brian De Palma`s classic film adaptation, I feel, is a lot better. The plot was produced with more focus on adolescence, and the severe emotions the main characters felt. There also a lot more powerful and unexpected moments. The book just didn`t do anything for me."
2,Not his best work.....,"This book Isn't as good as I would hope. It is to brief, it gets scary in the last twenty pages. If you want a good scary novel, go towards Cujo or The Exorcist. Maybe even try reading Watchers, that is a great book, but don't bother with Carrie!"
2,This book isn't that great.,"This was the first Stephen King book I read an prbably the worst. A bad storyline and the cover says it is gruesome, but, apart from when the guy gets hit by a wire and the Hargensen crash, no descriptions of death"
2,Disappointed,Big fan of the movie. The book was disappointing. I'm glad I saw the movie first. The book dragged on too much and the end was disappointing. Not as dramatic as I hoped.
3,A little erped.,"Book is in great condition, but I received it without the slipsleeve. I wish that had been made clear when I purchased the item."
4,Carrie- Stephen King,"The novel by Stephen King was a really good book I thought because it was based on a teenage girl who was very different from everyone else in her high school. She was such an outcast, and everyone treated her horribly. Once she had started her menstrual cycle, she discovered that she had a special power of telekinesis. She was able to move objects with her mind. She went to her prom and as part of a cruel and sick joke so she could be laughed at and humiliated by the entire school, pigs' blood was dropped on top of her. She was so traumatized by that and angered her that everyone was laughing at her, so she got revenge on those who teased her by killing them. At the end, she dies along with her mother. This is my favorite book out of all of Mr. Stephen King's novels that I have read."
5,Great- an excellent page-turner!!!,"I stayed up all night reading this one! I saw the movie, but then I decided to read the book because I wanted to find out if Sue Snell and Tommy Ross were in on the prom-night-prank thing. It turns out the book was so much better and interesting than the movie."
4,I couldn't put it down!,I read this book in one day! I loved it so much I wouldn't stop reading it! There was never a dull moment. A must read for any Stephen King fan.
4,Pretty good (but see the movie).,"Stephen King's debut is one hell of a page-turner, a great explosive read about what happens when one of us humans goes off. Everyone knows the plot, so let's move on: yes, the movie is better. Mostly because Sissy Spacek as Carrie White is a lot more sympathetic than she is in King's novel. Also, the destruction of the town at the end is a bit over the top. However, the way that Carrie exits the story in the book, with Sue, is very touching. Too bad they really couldn't have done that scene on film."
4,I think this is the best he has ever written,"I read quite alot 1 or 2 books a week. And i think this book is different it's scary and gets you felling about what he is writting about but my favourite book is ""Stand By Me"" it's about a bunch of kids who go on adventure to see a dead body"
3,A breath taking novel,"After the first couple of pages the book starts to get confusing.When the book jumps around from one person to another is when I found the book to be confusing.So far this is a pretty good book.I would rate it a 6. Reading Carrie you will find that it can get disgusting. For example, the part where Carrie started her period for the first time in the girls' locker room is one of the most unacceptable parts. The author goes into graphic detail. This book also has some profanity.I would recommend this book to older childern,Juniors,Seniors or someone who is exceptionally good at comprehending what they're reading."
4,Pretty Good Book,"This book has a great story. It's a little slow at times, but it's a nice length and still a pretty quick read. This is the first Stephen King book I ever read, and it definitely made me want to read more. (I've read two since, and am reading another now) The last 30 or 40 pages are incredible and definitely worth chugging along through the slower scenes. I was very impressed with how tense this book got and well it ends. It's a bit of a wait for the grand finale but once it comes you just can't put it down. Carrie is really sad, and takes a while to build suspense, but considering this is King's first published novel I'd say it's probably one of his better novels out there."
3,Not as good as King's other books,"I'm a Stephen King fan so this is not easy for me to say but... Carrie is not one of his better books. It was the first book he published and you can tell. King himself admits in his book ""On Writing"" that Carrie is not one of his best books."
4,Classic King,Read this years ago for the first time. Just as good this time. Haven't found a King book I didn't like.
5,Great Book!,"I have to say that I was suprised by this book. It was my first time reading a Stephen King book, and I thought I would get confused with all the science fiction stuff, but I was confused very rarely by this book. In some ways I thought it was better than the movie because the book goes into more details of all the characters lives. I liked that it was a lot different than the movie, and I didn't feel like I was reading the movie script. I think this book is great for anyone who's a Stephen King fan. This was very good considering it was his first book."
5,Creepy!,"CARRIE is an absolute classic. It was the first book by King that I ever read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I passed my copy on to my good friend, Leah who devoured it in a few days, and went on and on about it when she returned it to me. Carrie White is a seemingly innocent schoolgirl who is constantly tormented by her cruel peers and her strange mother. Carrie holds a power inside her that comes purely from anger and hate. Her mother, Margaret White, has a very strange view of Christianity...forcing Carrie to go into a small closet and pray for forgiveness after events as innocent and simple as her first period. Carrie finally gets a break when Tommy Ross asks her to go to the Prom. Little does she know that her hateful classmates are planning a surprise for her. Innocent teenager, or demonic prophet of Satan...Carrie will make you shudder."
2,The Movie Was Better Than The Book,"This book was pretty dry, without much color or interior monologue, just leaving me with the creeps and not much understanding. The story was actually portrayed much more forcefully in the movie. So I would recommend the movie over the book. If you're looking for a good read by King, try ""Thinner"" or ""Insomnia"" instead."
2,erm... uh... well,"Don't get me wrong, I a HUGE King fan. I love most everything he has ever written, he's a phenomenal author, yadda yadda yadda... but this book just didn't seem to do it for me. And it's a shame, ya know, because the basic idea is just so damn good! Zealot mom brainwashes and abuses daughter, daughter wants to break free, has telekinetic powers, made fun of at school, kills them all... that's great! But this book didn't have the character development that I've come to expect from King... maybe I've been spoiled! Also the plot seemed too simple - but that isn't my biggest complaint. Sometimes short and sweet is great. But why waste a wonderful idea on such short sweetness? Oh well, to each his own. My opinion of Stephen King is still as high as ever... in fact this makes me even more eager to read even more, better books by him!"
3,Average debut,"THis debut by master Stephen King clearly showed that he was destined to stardom. But I'm not particularly his fan; I think he overwrites, he talks too much to get at his point!Also, this stuff of all his plots happening in Maine is getting a little bit repetitive.But, back to CARRIE. THe book is good, altough average and, according to King himself, a little bit outdated, but still a good novel."
4,Raw King,"King's first novel has incredible power, as incredible as the psychic abilities of the title character. It doesn't always work, unfortunately; the outtakes and quotes from fictional studies of the paranormal become a little trite. That's a mere quibble, however. The meat of the book is engaging and intelligent, and the characters are fully realized. While the novel lacks the polish of later novels (The Shining, The Dead Zone, Insomnia), it also lacks the bloat. Recommended."
3,not scarey,i read all the reviews before i read the book and tought it was going to be scarey. i was really wrong . it was a pretty good story and had good action but it was written with a bad style and had no horror.
3,Clever and entertaining,"Enjoyed this book, perhaps in part because there was an attempt at a scientific explanation for the paranormal activities taking place. (I have a hard time suspending my disbelief for traditional horror, but I think this helped.) I liked the way the story was told--through interviews, excerpts from books and newspapers, letters (the ""works within the work"")--in addition to the narration. There is a definite attention to detail in the telling of the story, and all of the characters were believable; some of whom I could even empathize with. Deserves 3-1/2 stars if that was possible to do on Amazon."
4,For Mr. Knott,"Carrie White is an outcast, ridiculed by her peers in school and tormented at home by her religious zealot of a mother. Carrie's is an existence of mental anguish and depression. Unbeknownst to all Carrie possesses a power and ability none could ever imagine. Carrie's latent telekenetic ability eventually reveals itself when her fragile teenage psyche is pushed to its limit, and a small Maine town is summarily destroyed in a vengeful rage.King's Carrie is a character that all can associate with, we see ourselves and our most embarassing moments in Carrie's most embarassing moments. This emotional attachment everyone shares with Carrie makes the apocalyptic climax that much more powerful, as we can almost understand Carrie in that moment."
3,Alright if you like King,"If you like Stephen King then you have to read this book, simply because it was his first published novel. However I was very disappointed and I am very glad I did not read this book as my first Stephen King experience. It, to me is simply an average book. Once in awhile there are some scary moments but all in all I felt the book was a bit of a let down. If you are not a die hard Stephen King fan I highly suggest skipping this book, but that's just me."
5,highschool hello,stephen king was brilliant in his first attempt at horror fiction if your a girl and can't feel the deep turmoil of carrie your not normal....king is exsplosive.
3,Short but sweet,"I tend to have a ""love/hate"" relationship with books that deal with open relationships or polyamory. So, I was pleasantly surprised with this book. It is less than 100 pages but it touches on all the relevant issues involved in this ""lifestyle"" choice. She doesn't rationalize the subject or try to sell it the way some authors do. She sets it all out in a very concise, straightforward manner that leaves it up to the reader to make his or her own decision regarding the strengths or weaknesses of open relationships.So, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about open relationships. It gives a clear overview of the subject but doesn't bog him or her down with too much information.Dena"
2,Nice Anecdotes,While it provides some nice insite it wasnt quite what I thought. It is mostly her impressions and story. nice read but just not what I thought
5,The penultimate disc in a superb set of Burns!,Volumes 5 & 6 pick up where the previous two discs left off. (Was there no end to Robert Burns's genius at songwriting? Apparently not.) Play this disc and warm the cockles of your heart.
3,"Good intro, but not enough overview","Like other Starting Out books I have used, this provides a useful introduction to the main lines of the Slav and Semi-Slav. My main complaint is that individual moves are generally well-explained, but the themes of different variations are not. For example, the most basic question of why one would play e6 to enter the Semi-Slav rather than, say, dxc4 is never discussed. I learned more about this from the two paragraph intro to the opening in Sam Collins's Understanding the Chess Openings than I did here. To give another example, in the Semi-Slav Meran, after 8 Bd7, Flear notes that there are three typical responses for black and he indicates which he prefers, but he does not say why he prefers that one to the others.I don't mean to be overly critical. Overall, I found the book quite useful, but not as useful as other Starting Out books I have consulted."
2,Good Firewall and NAT. Unreliable WiFi. Limited VPN,"This router combo comes with a great firewall and NAT, but unfortunately suffers from very unreliable WiFi which disconnects regularly. The VPN would be great if only it did not time out all my connections after about 4 minutes. Also its limitation to 2 simulatenous PPTP tunnels is a bit on the low side."
2,Don't waste your money,"Ok so if you read my review on the actual detector, you can see I was not find the old deep coins. In theory, a bigger coil is supposed to add some depth so I flipped for the extra money on this bigger coil and got the same results as the 8"" coil. I called Bounty Hunter and their web site mentions nothing about extra depth and said the other places selling these should not be advertising that. There is NO gained depth with this bigger coil. I paid good money for nothing. The point of this coil is to cover more area in less time, however that means you are going too fast and missing targets. If you want it for a gain in depth over the standard coil 8"" that comes with unit, do not do it. Do not take my word for it, call Bounty Hunter they will tell you the same thing. I am now stuck with an extra coil and gained nothing. Going to save up and just buy a better detector."
5,Annie Claus Is Coming To Town,"Another feel good movie to watch whenever and wherever I want, no commercials. This is a family movie. Make it a movie night."
5,Girly Christmas movie!,Love this movie. Very cute. It is a chick flick Christmas movie. A little bit predictable like most chick flicks.
4,Cute enough to keep it,"Even though this story dealt with the element of Santa Claus, the values of true love and understanding were presented well in this production."
5,Annie Claus is coming to town.,I really enjoyed this movie. It was a nice clean and fun movie. I would recommend this to my friends.
1,Annie Claus is Coming to Town,I love the movie (watch it every time it is on TV) but the DVD was bad: it would stop; breakup; etc. I just gave up trying to watch it-- which is why the rating is so low.
3,OK,"I expected more from this movie. It's just ok. Includes a little bit of romance, a little bit of humor, but not really a movie I would recommend"
4,Does not have Subtitles,This is a cute holiday movie. I appreciated the way they worked Christ into Christmas with Santa. But one correction needs to be made in the product details. This DVD has caption not subtitles as is stated. That means you can play it on a DVD player and get caption but you can not get caption or subtitles on a blu-ray player with this product.
5,Arrived quickly...great movie!,A happy Christmas movie with warmth about Santa's daughter and a toy store in need of some Christmas magic and the rest you will have to watch and see. I don't want to spoil it...pop some corn and find a comfortable chair. Puts you in the Christmas mood.
4,Great Movie,"Very good movie. Watched it with my daughters on a cold, snowy afternoon - hubby even came in and watched!"
4,1GB Memory Sticks - Corsair,I received 2 of these 1GB memory modules packaged nicely.They arrived quickly (within a few days).I used them to update my Dell Optiplex (small form factor) GX620 Dual Core machine. The price was quite reasonable.They were the correct type and the update went smoothly.No problems at all with these...very smooth install and they are working fine!
4,"good memory, cheap cost","I purchased this memory for a low profile PC, works well, after several years, is slow but does the job, good memory at a good price."
1,wouldnt't waste my time,I got this memory stick and it's the EXACT one that's in my pc right now and NOTGHING. PC wont recognize it-dead. sent it back and got a second memory stick and now the PC won't even boot up with this memory stick in place...tried it in both slots and verified it by moving the existing ram around and checking in BIOS what was where and seen in what slot....don't know if I just ran into a bad batch but at least I have to give Amazon credit for sending the second one right away even though it was bad too. They also are very good about paying for shipping on defective items. I say it's buyer beware with this memory.....go for the more expensive stuff and save the headache. Which is what I had to do and now got the old beast up to 2gb of ram.
5,Rope Hoist saves the day,"Living in the Sun Belt of west Texas, down on the Mexican border, does not eliminate below freezing temperatures. I have 6 hanging plants on my patio. One is an asparagus fern that I re-pot into a larger pot every year. That has caused the plant to become very heavy. As the temperatures are forecasted to be below freezing, I need to remove the plants from the patio and move indoors. Because the fern has become so heavy, and my age is well above retirement, I can no longer lift the plant from the hook hanger that is well above my head. Having used this type of hoist in the past, I found this Rope Hoist on Amazon.com and made the purchase. It has served my purpose very well, saved the plant and my back. I recommend this Hoist for any job within it's capacity specifications. A very good device for the money."
5,A wonderful introduction to Monet!,"Linnea is a little girl who travels with her neighbor to Paris to see Monet's paintings. Delighted by what she sees, Linnea goes with her neighbor to Giverny to see Monet's wonderful home and gardens. This delightful book has the animated Linnea prancing along in the grounds at Giverny, which are presented in photographs. She learns and explains everything she sees; her sparkling ""personality"" makes Monet and his art come alive for young readers. Linnea is a joy! She can be purchased as a doll as well."
5,"Wonderful book, Must-book, for classroom and for children","This is a wonderful book for children. A parent can read it to a young child, or a child from 3rd grade to 6th grade will find it of value. It helps children to appreciate art, art history, as well as possibly inspiring them to take up art themselves. I've seen this book in many classrooms from classrooms in all grades in grade school. I've also used it to teach lessons and to provide art material for children to copy from to try their efforts at master works, replicas. They really enjoyed it very much. So, I would say, this is good for the classroom and for parents for children."
4,Linnea in Monet's Garden,I bought this book for my granddaughter to accompany a small doll I had bought while visiting Monet's home and garden back in 2001. The book was educational in regard to how he painted as well as entertaining. It was a little long for a 7 and 1/2 year old but she still seemed to enjoy it.
3,GOOD FOR ITS TIME....,"this release has been highly lauded by the ""stoner"" rock crowd,but is it any good??keeping in mind when it was recorded,production techniques being what they where in the early 70's,this isnt at all bad!not a ""clasic"" or ""essental"" in my book,but well worth a listen and worthy of a place on the collectors shelf.as other reviewers have stated,this is along the lines of Led Zepp and Deep Purple,not so much Black Sabbath (which is what i was after).a solid 3.5 star release"
4,mushroom growers indeed!,"I read somewhere that this was a very sought after vinyl recording from the early 70's. I am a vinyl collector so it peaked my interest. Newly released on CD, this was a very satisfying purchase! Considering it was recorded about the same time as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath were rising to the top, it makes for an interesting listen. The Leaf Hound were in that same English, blues meets psycedellic, hard rock. They may not sound as polished or professional as the mighty Zep, but still very cool. The album art work is worth the price of admission, but the late 60's, early 70's rock on this disc is also worth it! It even evokes the sound of an American hard rock pioneer, Blue Cheer."
5,Carrie's twangiest..,I love all of Carrie's music. This album is a great place for someone coming from country music to start with.
5,Great for your soul,"This is a great book for soul-nurturing. If you enjoy reading this book, you might also want to read another book, titled: ""Get Real: A Philosohical Adventure in virtual Reality."" It demonstrate how we humans can re-create the whole universe through virtual reality and teleoperation, and thus become co-creators of a new world."
2,worth watch movie,"Out of the performances, Richa Pallod impresses. She is a young in the industry, but she makes the film watchable to a certain extent. Rakesh Bapat is improving and complements his co-star well. The veteran actors are wasted and the rest of the cast are average tv serial stars.Music by Nikhil-Vinay is average. There is a song after every 5 minutes, and this slackens the pace of an already slow film. The comedy track is also quite lame and amateurish."
3,The sequel to space demons,"Can there possibly be another computer game as enthralling as Space Demons? A year later from their adventure with space demons, Andrew Hayford is bored and orders the next game. It reunites the former players Ben Challis, Mario Fellone and Elaine Taylor, as they are drawn into the next adventure. Danger arrives as Andrew's new step brother enters the game. Mario loses his last life and the only way for him to recover is for the other three to make their way past Andrew's brother and get to the centre of the maze."
1,Aikido Master Ueshiba - 2 DVD set,"The second DVD of the set was identical, REQUESTED the shipper send me the second DVD in return, no response. Even with follow up e mails.Ended up paying for 2 DVDs but only receiving the same DVD twice, even though the second DVD is marked second DVD."
1,Save your money!,This book really didn't help much at all. It should not be a 'handbook' at all. Maybe a 'leaflet' would be more accurate. Don't waste you hard earned cash.
5,SPECTACULAR READ !,"This book drew me in from page one... it is engaging, intruiging and reads like a thriller. I have never read anything by Ernest Hill in the past but I have become an instant fan !The characters in this book are realistic and well developed. You immediately develop feelings for these characters.. either you love 'em or just can't stand 'em !The story flows nicely with climatic peaks throughout...With this piece of work, Mr. Hill has raised the bar for all of my future 2003 summer reading."
2,Disappointed,"I read Cry Me A River as a book club reading, and I was very disappointed. I thought the writing was juvenile and found several inconsistencies in the plot. Every character seemed to neatly fit into a stereotype - the angry black sister, the church-going mother, the racist police chief, etc. Also, I felt no sympathy for Tyrone, the main character, as he sets out to prove his son's innocence. I expected better writing, a better plot line, and a more realistic story. Cry Me A River was like reading a made-for-TV movie."
2,Painfully Slow,"Despite good acting and a couple of amusingly realistic interactions between the characters, this tale of a young Argentine woman who returns from Buenos Aires to her hometown of Parana, sells her parents' house, attends a school reunion and then seeks to reunite with a former boyfriend is extremely uninvolving. The film drags and you never feel sympathy towards Ana, the protagonist.That is, until the movie's sole highlight: an excellent sequence in which the protagonist teaches a small kid how to court a girl. Its so touching and funny that one wishes the filmmakers would have included more scenes like that.The film also presumes too much familiarity with recent Argentine history. Without that background, the film won't seem to have a point. I would only recommend, and far from enthusiastically, the movie to die-hard fans of Argentine or Latin American cinema."
5,good buy,excellent services arrive just in time the dvd was in excellent conditions. all in all very good customer service it was everything I was hoping when I bought this product. and the price was great
1,How I Met Your Mother season 6,"While the product did arrive in an excellent time frame, when it arrived one of the discs was loose in the case. That same disc skipped so I ended up having to buy a new one from a local retailer."
1,Frustrating,"This was shipped to an address, twice, that we have moved from , and I have yet to receive anything. I will have a hard time buying from amazon again."
5,Gets better every time - like Friends,"I have watched this series since the beginning and the series feels a lot like ""Friends"". Loved the ensamble cast and the way that every character has it's own story arch. Loved the Canadian content and the jokes, especially the music videos. There is more character development in season 6 and the jokes are fresh"
5,Awesome!,"Great dvd with lots of special features, How I Met Your Mother is hilarious as always. Arrived quicker than expected."
3,More Commentary,One of the main reasons I buy the DVDs is for the special features and audio commentaries on the episodes since I can't get those from Netflix. Yet there is often only three or four episodes with commentary per season. I understand not doing commentaries for each and every episode but I would expect at least nine commentaries (about three per disc).Other than that HIMYM is one of my favorite TV shows and this season is even better than the last one. The unique blend of comedy with poignant dramatic moments makes you really care about the characters. This season was especially well balanced between comedy and drama.
2,broken case,the case was broken and disc flopping around inside case. the show is good had some glitching in couple episodes don't know if it's the discs or just my player processor acting up on the couple of spots.
5,The Burns Sisters Are Wonderful!,"I saw my then-housemate Annie Burns (Hi, Annie!)do this material with her sisters at Oliver's in Ithaca, NY just before Christmas in '91.Unforgettable ""Drummer Boy."" Usually I just cringe at this song the way it's butchered on most Christmas Compilations. The Burns sisters' a capella version was so beautiful, it had me sobbing like a baby to hear it.I'm very glad to see they've recorded these songs with Rounder."
3,In a way a winner,"I am not a fan of the Burns Sisters nor did this album make me a fan. However, I would recommend the album if it contained nothing but the track ""Come Come"" - a bit of Sufi poetry set to a simple and repeating tune that is a wonderful variation on the Christmas season's religious music.Luckily, the remainder of the album has music that is enjoyable - a good choice of material done with solid musical taste. And the breadth of the material - including Judaic and Tibetan pieces as well - sets it apart from the scores of competent Xmas season recordings."
1,Disappointed,"I so looked forward to listening to a Christmas CD by the Burns sisters. However, they were not songs of familiarity, so was disappointing."
5,One of his best,"I think I've read most of Dean Koontz' books. A few have slipped my radar and I'm trying to catch up now. I just finished Servants, and I think it's one of his best. I like his books because they are dark and the settings are often described with great detail. However, there tends to be a bit too many supernatural events, and too much back-slapping between characters, with some of his work. This one, I'd classify, as a pulse pounding suspense ride. Nothing too unbelievable, and well developed characters. I hope I can find some more Koontz I have missed as good as this one!"
3,"Good, not Great Koontz","I'm a big fan of Dean Koontz, but I thought this novel was just average. This book begins with an interesting concept -- a religious cult believes that a young boy is the anti-christ and is determined to kill him. The novel starts strongly, but eventually turns into a rather long-winded chase story. This novel is rather verbose and drawn out, almost as if Koontz was being paid by the word.This novel is rather unique for Dean Koontz because the villains in this book are not completely evil. The religious cultists in this book are actually somewhat sympathetic. This novel also has a somewhat ambiguous ending, which is rather odd for Koontz.THE SERVANTS OF TWILIGHT was written in 1984 under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols. Koontz wrote better books before this novel (WHISPERS, PHANTOMS, FACE OF FEAR) and much better books afterward (WATCHERS, ODD THOMAS, INTENSITY). My advice is to read those novels instead if you're looking for a great read."
3,Believable,"This was my first Dean Koontz novel; it was OK. It was a believable story; there are probably religious cults who could do crazy things like what are in this story. It has a lot of suspense and action more than half way through, but the chase scene toward the end lasts way too long. Koontz puts a lot of thoughts in his characters mind that are hard to believe when you think of what they are going through at the time. He uses these thoughts as fillers and many of them are repeated too often."
4,servants of twilight,"I am new to the novel reading scene.When a friend recommended I give the book a try,I was'nt sure I would even finish the entire book.Boy,was I wrong.This book is like the energizer bunny;when you thought it was time for things to slow down they unexpectedly speed up.I was captivated by the suspense and action of the book.If storys about Good versus Evil,the birth of the son of God or satan,and the eternal struggle between heaven and hell appeal to you,THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!"
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"im 17 and just finished reading The Servants of Twilight. Dean R. Koontz is a master at writing... i loved his details and the way he explained the story... he is the best author i have ever read and i love to read some more of his books. Everyday at school i would tell my friends what happened next. Every morning they would ask me ""So what happened next? Did they get away safe?"" I recomend this book to ne teens out there looking for something to read. But im warning u. once u start u cant put the book done. Happy reading!!!!"
1,Classic Example of Why I'm afraid to spend money on Koontz,"Don't get me wrong, at times I love Koontz. I think Phantoms, Whispers, House of Thunder, and Intensity are among his best. BUT the other extreme are his characters that are super-perfect and overcome such odds that it left me rolling my eyes in exasperation. Also the ending greatly disapointed me. ""Was"" he or ""Wasn't"" he? There is no closure. Don't waste your time! Along with 'The Mask' one of Koontz's worst ever."
5,One of the best I have read.,"This book was filled with suspense, I could hardly put it down. This is a masterpiece to go along with many of this others.Tracy Donovan"
5,This is a real-page turner.....I couldn't put it down,"I loved this book from the first few paragraphs. I found myself taking it everywhere I went. I was even reading it at work inbetween customers. I read this book about 2 years ago, and still think about it occasionally. I was so engrosed in it, I couldn't wait to finish it.....sometimes missing a whole nights' sleep. I would reccomend this book to anyone looking for a REAL adventure."
4,It keeps you interested.,"A very interesting book from my favorite author. I especially liked the fact that there were no weird, indestructable creatures in it, the characters were actually people. You should write more books along this line. I think the ending could have used a little more work, you left too much unresolved. I enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading more of your works in the future. I read everything you and S. King write!"
3,Pretty Good,This is a semi disturbing story of a mother and her young son on the run from a crazy cult that wants to kill her son. It is pretty standard Koontz stuff you come to expect from him. I was entertained but it was nothing spectacular
3,not his best,When I read this book I worked in Bullocks in South Coast Plaza. It was too close to home for me. Of course at that time every book he wrote took place in Orange County. I do think Dean Koontz is a wonderful writer & I own all of his books & I will keep on reading all of them
5,You'll sleep the next day from being up all night.,"Koontz has outdone himself this time. Suspenseful and spellbinding, Servants makes one watch their back. So realistic and detailed you hear and feel yourself telling the characters to act on their emotions. You'll be reading well into the morning and then some. Outstanding!"
2,A pretty juvenile book...,"Koontz seems unable to say anything in 10 words if he's able to find a way to say it in 60 words instead. I spent the majority of this book reading, ""and he noticed how she moved"" next page, next page next page. ""He felt for the boy"" next page, next page, next page....It's as if he wrote a 100 page book that they demanded that he turn into a longer novel...Very simplistic, the hero fails on nearly every level and yet we're supposed to feel pity for him. Koontz claims that autism can be caused by emotional trauma, a theory that was well disproved 40 years ago...this is a decent idea for a plot that is realized in such a terribly bloated plot as to be painful.Simply more evidence that the Odd Thomas books and everything else by Koontz could not have possibly have been written by the same author...wait for it to hit the .99cent bin..."
4,Great book!,"I love this book! This is the second copy I've purchased, so I could read it again. One of Koontz's best!"
2,Why are the nuts chasing?,"This is a novel first published under a different name, and after reading it I conclude he did so because he or his publisher realized it was not up to the Koontz usual standard. A basic chase story, only there's no real reason why the pure kid was picked out to be chased. I'd pass on this one, and head for Odd Thomas instead, a real Koontz novel."
3,Koontz put out a number of enjoyable novels back about 6 to 10 years ago,Koontz put out a number of enjoyable novels back about 6 to 10 yearsago but his later novels are a little weird. At least that is my thinking.
3,Not one of his best,"Compared to other horror novels, this will hold its own. However, if you are expecting Koontz originality and genius, this comes up short. I felt that there was alot of filler, pages that just went on and on about nothing. A wicked witch believing that she is receiving messages from God insists that she must sacrifice the life of Joey, the only child of widow Christine. I felt that I could predict everything to come and was mostly right. It just felt like a used and abused story."
2,"Painful to finish, but I HAD TO!","Thank God this is not the first D. Koontz I have read, because I'd be sort of ""gun shy"" to read another. But alas...I love Dean Koontz and will probably read every thing he has ever written. S.O.T. starts out faced paced, which I love about Dean, but it soon becomes predictable and sooooo drawn out. Unfortunatley I always finish reading what I start, but let me tell ya this one was a test of my endurance!The ending gets one star. Corny, syrupy, very predictable, very dissapointing. I could not wait for it's finish! Dean you're still the BEST when it comes creepy [story] writing,this one.....not so much.xoxo James"
5,As only Koontz can!!!!!,It was a fantastic read....and I enjoyed reading it from cover to cover! I hope he never stops writing mystery novels.
3,Full of suspense,"Right from the beginning, this book had me hooked. Christine Scavello and her young son Joey find themselves confronted in a mall parking lot by a crazy old woman, Grace Spivey, who thinks that six year old Joey is the Antichrist. Spivey is the leader of a the Servants of Twilight, a religious cult whose fanatic members do her everything she requests. Christine hires a PI to investigate Spivey and her followers a bit further. The last 100 pages or so are such a let down. The rest of the book was so fast paced that I didn't want to put it down but near the end I felt myself skimming over a lot. It's still a decent read."
2,Not what I expected!,"This is my second Koontz book and I was dissappointed. I first read TICK TOCK in three days. It was great. But this book, on the other hand, isn't. It started out right to the point and had identafiable characters, but then 250 pages I put it down. It just became to dull and predictable!"
4,Wow!,"I started reading this book and couldnt put it down. I got really involved with the characters, but that si what always happens with his books. This book was one of his best!"
5,servents of twilight,i think this book was great i really enjoyed reading it. i will certanly read it again.
5,thank you,Item is exactly as described by seller. Item is of good quality. I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for such an item at a great price!
5,cbrown52,Anothe great book by Dean Koontz. I love reading it from begining to end. Dean Koontz is one of my favorites.
5,A four out of five star book.,"Read this book, one of the most gripping novels of Koontz. A mixture of romance and terror always hits the spot. The most detailed book I ever read. If you like horror you will be up all night reading this book."
2,Small on Size and Functionality,"Not a good iPod alternative (though not advertised as one.) Got this for my teenage daughter instead of a larger, more functional MP3 player. Wish I had saved the money towards a bigger and better MP3 player."
2,Ode on a Grecian what?,"Whoever was responsible for entitling this collection of Plutarch's Lives ought to be buried alive like a naughty Vestal Virgin. To apply the adjective ""Grecian"" to the men of Hellas is a travesty. At best, they should have used the term ""Greeks."" Honestly. ""Grecian"" is and should ONLY be applied to things manufactured by Greeks, not to Greeks themselves. It's like calling the people of Scotland ""Scotch."" Try that one in an Edinburgh pub and see how long you last. Unfortunately the ""noble"" men Hellas are not around to defend themselves, so I have to do it for them. ""Lives of the Noble Hellines and Romans"" is itself more noble."
3,A rough read,"Plutarch's Lives is one of my all time favorite books. I especially enjoy the ""gay windows"" in Alcibiades life and the description of Archimedes defense of Syracuse. My three star rating has nothing to do with Plutarch and everything to do with the terribly outdated translation ""update"" by Sir Clough. Sure, as another reviewer points out, it is vocabulary enhancing, but Plutarch was not a Victorian English gentleman. If you like Victorian prose, read a Victorian novel or something. I would actually prefer to read Dryden and company's undoctored original than wade through Clough's train wreck, as I find 18th century prose an easier read, and Dryden was a better writer.If someone were to do a modern translation of the Lives, more people would be able to enjoy it. Unfortunately, the sad truth is that you can probably count the number of good classical translators on one hand, and how many of them have the time to translate Plutarch?"
4,A good starting place.,This thin book is a good reference book for the professional or academic geologist. The maps are very useful but the best parts of the book are the reference section and bibliography. I'd give it a five star rating if the references and bibliography were updated to include the last decade of literature. This is a great little book for starting some of your research in the available literature on this topic.
3,Too dark and depressing,"In this diary of a young girl, the narrator, Lou Ann, tells a story of her family's farm and the events that happen in her young life. Her mom is strange and abusive and depressed; and her dad is a man who gave me the willies. This is a highly dysfunctional family to say the least.Though the simplicity of the narrator's words rang authentic enough, and it was heartwarming to read of Lou Ann's brief and singular hope, it was a melancholy tale. The story lacked anything even resembling humor to balance out the darkness -- of which there was far too much. At least for my taste."
4,Good Book!,"This is a really good book! Not only was it relatively short but it was also very interesting. There is a lot of description used, and it just pulls you right in. It is written as a diary so there are many different emotions that are packed in! Lou Ann is a little girl who lives in Texas with her mother, father and brother. Her father is unfaithful, and her mother is crazy. Lou Ann creates a separate world for herself, and the Box Children. I highly recommend this book to anybody that likes a book that is fast and easy to read, and that enjoys stories that will stay with you forever."
4,Makes you want to reach into the pages and rescue this child,"For such a small novel, the author packs an emotional punch with the character of eleven year old Lou Ann. To say Lou Ann's family is dysfunctional is an understatement; Daddy has a roving eye and Mama's laundry list of neuroses would fill the page. To cope with this intolerable home life, Lou Ann creates an imaginary world with ""The Box Children"", the unborn babies from her mother's many failed pregnancies. This novel speaks to the resiliant spirit of children from dysfunctional homes, and offers a somewhat hopeful future for our heroine. If you read this book you will think as I do, that Lou Ann was able to triumph over adversity and make her way in the world. 4.5 stars"
5,Tangible Grace ~,"I have been a lonely child. I have hungered for a connection to a parent that was too busy, too self- centered, too broken. I have known and loved imaginary playmates that were more real to me than the actual living, breathing world. I have been confused by the ways of grown ups to the point of desperation. Sharon Wyse has created a character that could've been me - or you - or her. Lou Ann's struggle to be seen and heard, to belong, to be cherished - is so utterly profound and immediate - that I still hear her voice in my head. Sharon Wyse lives up to her name - she gives us a little girl with a story that will echo in our hearts forever."
4,sharp wire cutters,They work great when you use them for what they are meant for. Shipped fast. Mine were slighty off at cutting end but not enough to effect their use. They were great until I accidently tried to cut a soft price of metal. Ruining the blades in the process. But if you use them on wires like they should be they are great. Four stars because one of the handles became loose and slides off from time to time. Otherwise great!
3,Iffy,At first the wisecracking is cute and often funny but somewhere in the middle of the book it starts to become annoying. The murder plot is not well thought out and kinda spills out towards the end because it has to go somewhere. Lacking.
2,A botched movie with some very good actors.,"The actors are excellent and the movie gives what seems to be a good presentation of life at the beginning of the 20th century in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.However, there is little connection between the real story of Colonel Redl's betrayal as a Russian spy and the confusing plot of this movie.The real story, entirely missed by the script, was that Redl had modernized Austrian counter-espionage techniques, and, ironically was in the end caught by a colleague who had been trained by himself. What goes around, comes around...You'll learn more about this story on Wikipedia. Why the movie makers decided to screw up a good plot, we'll never know."
4,Life after The Clash,"Having heard this material via live recordings from his current tour, I was fairly certain that this album was going to be great. But, I didn't realize how great t'll I completed listening to it. Its always hard to move forward after having been in one of the most powerful and influential bands of an era. Certainly, The Clash are are a hard act to top. Joe has shown that he's more than capable of moving forward and not living in the shadow of his former Band. Hat's off to Joe Strummer!"
4,Better than the reviews it's getting.,"If you don't go in expecting Joe to duplicate what the Clash did, this album will please you, and grow on you, as it already is on me. Forget the raging tear-it-up attitude of old; this stuff is downright mellow. And that's okay. It's still got attitude, which comes through loud and clear."
5,Touching and Heartfelt,"To start off, I've been a huge Clash fan since i was like 7. Not only are they one of my favorite bands (up there with the Beatles, Violent Femmes, and non-swing Cherry Poppin' Daddies), they were one of the most intelligent and genre-bending. As everyone knows, they disbanded in the mid-80s, and it's great to see that half of the driving force behind the band hasn't lost his musical prowess. Strummer's new album, while very un-Clash (with the exception of their slower numbers, a la Straight to Hell, et al), is a poignant, subtle album filled with his obvious penchant for electronica (as seen on the Grosse Pointe Blank soundtrack). I'm tempted to compare this album to my all time favorite, Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind. Both albums are by men who have experienced quite a full life and may be getting older, but by no means rustier."
4,Classic Joe,Fans of The Clash will not be disappointed with this effort from Joe and the boys. I bought the CD on the strength of Tony Adams & Yalla Yallah downloaded a while back and the rest of the tracks are equally good :o)
3,If you like B.A.D. you might think this one is bad.,"Riddle me with ""No's"" but I found this to be an ordinary audio adventure. I've played it twice all the way through and and nothing jumps out here. I believe all of the praise comes from people who have a lot of nostalgia for the Clash.My Impression:It's sort of like going to a bar and there is a band playing all of their own material but in the end you don't buy their home brewed CD because you have a feeling that they will be back next week sounding much the same."
3,The Inevitable Comparision,"OK I'll try to be fair. Like it or not Joe Strummer's solo work will be forever compared to what he accomplished with The Clash. The first song on this album: ""Tony Adams""= The only great song on this album. Why not just download it off his free MP3 files?! I'm not crazy about ""The Mescalaros"" music, not at all! Joe's lyrics and vocal style are always a plus but the Meskies music is nothing short of chaotic. If your a hard core Strummer fan you probably own this album by now, especially since the wake of his tragic passing. Why not go on E-bay and bid on some of Joe's solo stuff the songs he did BEFORE his work with The Meskies, you'd probably be doing yourself a favor...Rest In Peace Joe, I love you man!"
5,"Lyrics, will blow your mind","This CD will grow on you big time. Listen to it with volume way up and read the lyrics while listening. What a Joy. Joe Strummer is a genious. One of my top 10 CDs of all time right there with London Calling. A must BUY. One reviewer says ""Strummer gives rock & roll another kick in the pants""."
4,Very comprehensive,"This is a very comprehensive history on railroad safety. It covers the relationship between Management, Labor, and Government in the matters of railroad safety. It covers manufacturing defects, human error, it does not give a detailed synopsis of incidents like I expected. It is a history of policy more than a review of incidents and their causes in this respect it differs signifigantly from Shari Stamford Krause's book Aircraft Safety, Accident Investigations, Analyses, & Applications."
5,My MacBook screen is clean!!,"I tried Apple Polish, iClear and plain water. They all left my MacBook screen streaky. But thanks to the other reviews here, I bought this product, and it works wonderfully. The screen looks like new! No streaks, no smears, just a beautiful, shiny screen."
5,"Excellent product, works on my Dell flatscreen monitor","This Monster product works very well, it cleaned my 19"" Dell flatscreen desk monitor without incident, and left the screen in pristine original condition. Usually I avoid Monster products like the MonsterCables because they are so outrageously priced, but since this is priced competitively I bought it. You get two bottles of the solution, so it seems like this package will last me forever. The microfiber cloth that comes in the package is good quality and is easily cleaned after use with plain soap and water."
3,ok,this did work good at getting fingerprints and everything off my screen but did leave a film that was hard to get off..
2,NO BETTER THAN MOST!,After 2 applications on my apple laptop..still smear!! Used their towel that was included. Do I try a third application? Just don't agree with the other reviewers with my experience. I was really looking for some magical stuff after reading all of the positives. But was disappointed to say the least. i wouldn't give water 1 star!!
2,Alluring Price. Kind of Works,"There's a lot of product for the price and the cleaning cloth is really soft and strong. The cleaner gets off finger prints and the other little specs that get on the screen. The downside is that it actually does streak. The streaks aren't too ""heavy"" but there is a lot of them. I've tried it on both of my screens (Acer and Asus) several several times. You can get a little bit of the streaks off if you use a dry part of the cloth and wipe the screen over and over and OVER. Really disappointed after reading the reviews. I may return this product."
5,No Disappointments!,"This product lived up to all the other great reviews I read prior to making my purchase.I've used it on my LCD TV, laptop screen and digital camera. It cleans wonderfully; no streaks, and more importantly, no damage to my stuff!"
3,Not what I expected,"I had to do several applications before it worked. But hey, it's still way better than the electronic wipes and the price is reasonable."
1,A literary root canal. The best part is the end.,Possibly the most boring book I've ever read. The ONLY redeemable thing about this book is that it is mercifully short.
3,Impostures Intellectuelles,"Reading this reminded me of an article publishedby Messrs Jean Bricmont and Alan Sokal that argued that ""modern French philosophy is a load of old tosh.""Then they went on publishing a book on a subject, called""Impostures Intellectuelles""While Pynchon is not a French philosopher, this book could beclassified as a load of tosh. The plot is convoluted asthere is a much of nonsense thrown around without justificationor regard for its relevance within the story line.Among other things we learn that:1. There is a Perpetual Motion Machine built (and operationalapparently) in UC-Berkeley.2. Huge right-wing anti-government conspiracy operates a stealthpostal system, known as WASTE.3. Charcoal for cigarette filters is produced from human bones4. LSD could be an impediment for effective communication5. Etc.Overall, it is a good wholesome summer read, although one wonderswhether the author was under the influence of the said LSD whilecoming up with some of his dense writing."
1,Who Cares?,"This book comes across as severely dated and lame. All the people who love this book are either nerds who think they're in on Pynchon's ""joke"" or they are nerds who havent read a good book like Catch-22."
3,You need to like the writing style to like the book,"I was told that this book was a very good intellectual read. I am someone who had previously struggled through Joyce's Ulysses. As difficult for me as that book was, this one was a lot tougher to get through. I am not big on stream-of-consciousness writing and enormous difficulty understanding and following what was happening in this book.I can see that the book has some good writing. I am sure that the book is quite good if it is your style. That is why I am still giving it 3 stars. It is quite possible that this book is like an IQ test. Only people with Mensa stats can get what's going on here. I guess I have not arrived at that level."
4,singular experience,"I hated this book at the halfway point. Really. Wanted to launch it across the room. But a bit later things get oddly and uniquely interesting, and I got caught up. There are a few points (in particular Oedipa's journey thru san francisco) where it really is as if you are reading a different book from the one you started. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but here is it somehow works (mostly).The book is in some ways an unwieldy mess, and I think you have to not get too hung up on every detail, allusion, pun and riddle. Does help to keep a dictionary and search engine handy, though. It's a novel that sort of teaches you along the way how to read it and what to pay attention to. This means you are likely to be confused for a while, possibly annoyed, but almost certainly surprised and possibly enlightened by the end."
3,Left me feeling kind of stupid,"I haven't felt like this after reading a book in a long time. This is not to say that I dislike difficult books. I typically enjoy a challenging read. It was suggested that I would like this book because I have given books by DeLillo, Ellis, and Danielewski high ratings.What makes this different? Most importantly, I think, is that I felt no great attachment to any of the characters, especially not Oedipa Maas. Therefore, the intrigue is not nearly as compelling as it could be. Who cares about the conspiracy, W.A.S.T.E., Tristero, or Thurn and Taxis? Especially given the final outcome.I do, however, give it three stars because it has some moments of brilliance. The revenge play is fantastic, the word play is often amusing, and it does have a hallucinatory feel.Obviously, some people will like this more than I did. I fully accept that. If you're up for a challenge, enjoy language, and don't put a high premium on characterization or plot, then this is worth the read."
3,interesting names do not make interesting characters,"Aside from the zippy names and esoteric references, there is very little about this novel that keeps one interested. While Pynchon demonstrates a keen eye for the So. Cal. culture of the 60's, the narrative goes nowhere and takes the reader with it."
2,Quite stressful,"Though I admire Pynchon as a monumental writer in postmodern American literature, I must say that reading The Crying of Lot 49 was anything but relaxing. I truly admire Pynchon's clever wit and humor, but the symbolism and references hidden behind every other word made me feel absolutely exhausted. I would still recommend this book, but only to someone who is up for a deep, mind-twisting read - not for a soothing novel for the tub."
1,"Por favor, nada Maas.","I was vaguely aware of the existence of Thomas Pynchon, and after hearing a brief summary of CoL49 I went to the library and grabbed this and 'V'. I got as far as page seventy before I hung it up and decided to take them both back. It's got that weird wacky 'everything ends up being connected' vibe of my favorite Vonnegut books, but without the humor or the sense that I cared about the characters or what happened next. I never really got a sense of character from anybody except Mucho Maas, and people seemed to behave in whatever manner would propel the chaos engine Pynchon was frantically trying to keep spinning with this book. The writing felt awkward and disjointed, sentences sometimes needing two or three readings to decipher. But it did keep making me think ""I should read Slaughterhouse Five again""."
2,Tiresome,"The first chapter is interesting enough to keep you reading, but it gets tiresome quite rapidly. The characters, funny as they may be - initially - are getting mired in a strange theory of conspiracy.Unfortunately, the plot doesn't stick and the reader looses interest in it. After the VERY long description of the ""Courier's Tragedy"" play you are left with the feeling that enough is enough...I understand the pivotal, crucial part the play has in the book but still...devoting such a long chapter to it is an overkill.The only motive to keep on reading is that the book is short, Pynchon is a true master of the English language, funny / interesting situations appear from time to time and one expects Pynchon to deliver.This does not happen and the book ends leaving the reader with the feeling that he/she couldn't care more if the conspiracy detailed really had a base in reality or not."
5,Pynchon's Perfect Little Gem of a Novel...,"Reading Pynchon is like partaking of a delicious liqueur that makes you drunk on a sip: you love it but it's well nigh impossible to read quickly.Savour every well-chosen word of Lot 49.Pynchon portrays a world where everything is a coincidence, but all coincidences are suspect. He weaves an intricate web of chaos around Oedipa Maas (our heroine) that almost reveals itself to be anything but chaotic (but not quite). At times, the satire may seem to be a little thickly applied, but it all serves a purpose in this, Pynchon's most concise and enjoyable novel."
1,Very disappointing....,"After reading the great reviews, I was really excited to obtain a copy, but was quickly disappointed. The story was dated pretentious nonsense from the sixties and hasn't aged well. Read it if you like to torture youself alacommunity college Contemporary American Lit., or better, just keep it on the shelf to impress your friends. When they ask you about it, make something up. They'll never read it anyway."
2,I gave it my all...,"I sat down and read each of the six chapters TWICE in this novel, and I didn't understand hardly anything. I know Pynchon is an outstanding author and I'm sure there's plenty of symbolism I should have picked up on, but guess what? I didn't. I like novels that make you think, but this one is like looking at a piece of art and just drawing a blank. The characters are interesting, but not detailed. No one can deny that... The story itself is engrossing for the first 50 or so pages. Then I just completely lost where Pynchon took the novel. Do you have to be over forty years old and have three degrees in English to understand his concepts? However, if anyone would like to explain any aspect of the novel to me, I would love to hear about it. Just use the address provided above. Thank you."
4,Shortest Pynchon and therefore best Pynchon,"I think of Pynchon as the Robin Williams of recent (undeservedly) widely-bought, (undeservedly) widely-taught, and (deservedly) widely-unread fiction: in small doses, Williams and Pynchon come off as brilliant, artful, and socially insightful. In increasing doses they become appallingly tiresome; their audience (mostly captive, in the case of Pynchon) starts being bored with the same addled antics over and over; then the audience starts wondering if Pynchon/William's apparent talent is in fact some tiresome neurological condition; finally the the audience ends up accepting this hypothesis, and hoping that the condition is either treatable, or quickly terminal.So, read /just/ this short book and have a chance at enjoying Pynchon."
5,"Dark humor, satire, word play -a wonderfully convoluted tale","I've heard of Pynchon of course, but had never experienced his work, until now. Now I know the meaning of ""Pynchonesque"" and will never have to wonder again what it means.On the surface, the subject matter of this book is serious and bleak. Conspiracies abound. People die mysteriously. Paranoia and hallucinations twist the mundane into knots. Pynchon pulls the reader's leg with his genius, provokes thought processes beyond the superficial. He does it gradually and sneakily -- with prose that varies from beautifully wrought to exasperating, characters named Mucho Maas and Fallopian, a radio station named KCUF, and more outrageous plot twists than mind can comprehend -- until I did not know whether to gasp, laugh, or cry by the last page."
4,reserved endorsement,"While Pynchon's circular, postmodern storytelling techinques can be misleading and frustrating; the story emerges as a compelling condemnation of everything America stood for at the end of the second world war. After reading this novella, you will never be able to drive through a suburban strip mall again."
5,A brilliant piece of 20th century literature,"Lot 49 is a unique book, and one of my favorites of all time. I read it for the first time years ago in a class which had T.S.Eliot's Wasteland as central theme, and it was in this context that I came to explore its different levels of meaning. The most fascinating quality of Lot 49 comes from its weaving a highly colorful tapestry, where comical anecdote, subcultural jargon, social satire, historical revelations, and philosophical discourse on moral values are all entertwined. The result is a complex, highly entertaining concentrate of food for thought that I'm not about to forget, and a book to which I am in fact deeply attached. (For those who have trouble understanding the underlying themes, try reading Grant's ""Companion to Lot 49"", or the York Notes.)"
3,What tha...?,"I'm sorry...what?This book reads like a giant riddle. It's entertaining, thought provoking and laugh-out-loud funny in places, but it's also very confusing in other places.while reading this book, I got the feeling that someone had removed every third sentence. And when I finished it, I felt like the final chapter was missing.At times, you wander if Oedipa is dreaming, and then you realize she's not...but maybe she was dreaming during the last sentance....It's like that."
2,Some wit embedded in impenetrable gibberish,"Reading this book is a painful experience. But those that manage to slug through this gleaming example of the nadir of 20th century prose will get the occasional chuckle. I am positive that Pynchon does have something of value to say, and if you can make it through his unintelligible writing style and acid-head syntax, I am sure you can find it."
4,Pynchon is God,"Back in the sixties, I remember carrying a well-worn copy of LOT 49 around with me wherever I went, wherever I hung out in Berkeley. Pynchon was God; He knew. He gave us the California landscape, its craziness, its mindscape as no other author had done before. So what if the book was a put-on? So what if it was really about the ""selling"" or ""crying"" in real estate terms of the lot that is California, the state created by the 49ers? So what if the characters were straight out of comic books? It was the way he had woven it all so artfully together, a California of one piece, comprehensible for a change, maybe even understandable. I thank Pynchon for doing that. From time to time, I go back to LOT 49, taste the language and descriptions, do a few mental jumps in time back to that bizarre period in American life. Pynchon saw it all so early, so clearly."
1,"Wow, was this excrutiating","I got half way in, expecting something to happen, but nothing ever did. I learned nothing about the characters, the story did not move forward, and massive amounts of irrelevant trivia were thrown in - to make the writer seem clever? In this book, the joke's on the reader. Stay away unless you also really dig monotonal music too."
2,Good enough for goverment work..,"COL 49 is a good warmup for V. no doubt, but while touted as being more 'accessible' than either V. or Gravity's Rainbow, is more like a notebook or sketchbook for those books.There are many clever metaphors floating in this Sargasso Sea, but Pynchon will never be a master of character. Not all novels are about human character but those which are not seem to suffer from the problems the aforenamed Sargasso does; still, shallow and crowded with flotsam.Perhaps Pynchon is the greatest American novelist of our time; maybe Jeff Koons is the 'greatest' American artist of our time; maybe our deepest sentiments and hopes have been invested in our cars. Keep living and see what changes."
3,Call me the online ape.,"I didn't much care for this book. I felt it was bland, believe it or not. It was a fairly challenging read, yes, and it had a few redeeming ideas. But what disturbs me the most is the idea that if you don't like this book you're some TV gorged ape or other simian counterpart. The types of people who tell me that I don't like this book because I possess not the lofty intellect to appreciate it, are the same types who tell me I am racist for not liking ""The Invisible Man,"" or I am sexist for not enjoying Sylvia Plath in general. As the ""Great Writers Are Not to Blame for Your Lack of Education,"" guy stated that he feared complaints that some novels are too challenging would lead to ""The Dumbing Down of America,"" I fear the uglier problem at hand is the inability of a person to state his/her opinion without being assailed as some sort of saboteur to a school of theory or line of thinking."
3,"Great idea, flawed writing","The ideas contained in this book are as good as you can get. There are symbols and symbols of symbols, metaphors of metaphors. It also contains whacky characters, weird situations, and ancient conspiracies. In all, a fun mix.Too bad the writing is flawed. The problem is twofold. First off, when Pynchon tries to be deep he can become unreadable. Luckily I understood (at least I think I understood) what he was getting at without these verbal misfires. Second, Pynchon can cut a little too close to the bone in his prose. He cuts away vital cues in his dialogues and descriptions in an attempt to sound modern.I still recommend this book. However, be forwarned: This will not be easy reading, and it won't be your fault."
3,You need a guidebook,"Wow. What does it all mean? I see glimpses of brilliance but have trouble piecing it all together -- much like the main character Oedipa. Maybe the joke's on me.This was a tough book. There must be 500 pages crammed into the 150 I read. Given that I'm going to need to read some interpretation to figure out what I read that may turn out to be literally true.This probably is a great book. I'm just not smart enough to make that judgement. It was work trying to figure it out.I kept thinking it had something to do with religion but who knows?BTW, in many ways it reminded me of Still Life with Woodpecker by Tom Robbins or The Bushwhacked Piano by Thomas McGuane."
2,"Noteworthy, yes... but a pleasure to read, not so much...","To say this book is odd would be an understatement. It almost feels like it induces paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions all at once. I can't say I really enjoyed reading it -- with the exception of the first chapter, which was quite fun -- but I did appreciate it. I found Pynchon's sense of humor very entertaining -- my particular favorite character name being Genghis Cohen -- but the plot became so convoluted that I just kind of gave up trying to figure it out. I think that was sort of the point, though: giving up on ""reality"" and just accepting the absurdity and uncertainty. In the 1960s when this was written, I have no doubt his style was novel and groundbreaking. Now, it just seems to be a case of ""been there, done that."" I appreciate the satire, but think its message is still eluding me. Maybe it will come to me down the line, perhaps through that nebulous, conspiratorial entity Pynchon attempts to expose: The Postal Service!"
3,I've made photo copies that look better...,"I can't believe I'm writing this, or that I even care, but seriously the print in this book looks like a photo copy!!! Each page looks like you took a book and copied it onto a larger sheet of paper. Very poor quality."
2,Disappointing,"I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time, and I realize that it's considered a ""classic"", so I was surprised and disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Basically, Holt describes various situations where children are playing and learning. If I hadn't already observed the same kinds of things with my own children, maybe this would have been enlightening. If you're someone who's spent time with young children, I don't think you'd get much out of this book. Perhaps if you haven't, then it might be interesting."
3,The Treasure Is At The End,"I had a hard time with this one... I think its description needs to be more straight forward: reads like a scientific journal/notes of observations. I was bored a lot, but determined to complete the book.I was glad I did. The last chapter and follow up were the best parts of the book! I loved the last chapter that summed up all of his thoughts and observations into an idea. Very thought provoking.Now someone just starting out on the parenting track might enjoy his notes and observations better than someone who has already been through it like me."
4,The Hiding Place;,"The Hiding Place is a wonderful book. I have read it before when I wa s younger, and it was just as good as I remembered."
5,a personal account of the holocaust as told by a Christian,this is an amazing book. corrie ten boom and her family show an extraordinary amount of faith and service to their jewish friends. i highly recommend this book. one of the best i've ever read.
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"I first read this book in the 70's then visited Haarlem Holland a year or so later. I toured their house and stood in the ""hiding place"". It was such a memorable experience. I think you will enjoy this touching story."
5,This book saved my life,"I will not go into detail on this very public site about what this author, and her book, mean to me. Suffice it to say that I would not be alive today, without having heard Corrie's message of God's infinite love.As a psychiatrist, I have bought, and given away to patients, at least 50 copies of this book over the past two decades. It is more powerful than the strongest of antidepressants.Corrie ten Boom is a saint. She will not be officially recognized as such by the Catholic Church since she was nominally a Protestant. I say nominally, because her heart, like God's, was deep enough and wide enough to encompass and embrace all people, no matter what ""religion"" they practiced. Corrie's religion was Love."
5,The victorious story of Corrie Ten Boom.,This story is emotionally hard to read sometimes and I'm sure you'll find a tear or two somewhere in this classic novel about a courageous family dedicated to saving all the Jews they can from Hitler's Nazis. This story teaches us that miracles do happen today and how great God is to us- even in the barracks of an unfriendly German concentration camp.
1,VERY VERY SLOW BOOK,"The hidng place is a very slow book. Although, once it starts to pick up, you might start to like it, but i didn't. This book was a waste of my time. I would never have read it if my school had not forced me to. The writing is actually very good, but the plot itself takes a long time to establish itself."
5,Amazing story,I love her story. Makes me want to be a better person. Sad and inspiring. The human spirit is capable of much strength and survival
5,History in a story,"Great tale and nice to see history with a since of 'right and wrong'. Great book and a very fast read, easily finished in a day. The heroic efforts of this family and the dedication to Scripture beliefs is truly inspirational."
5,excellent!,"had GLENN BECK not mention how essential it is to read this book, i probably would not have heard about this extraordinary woman-i also saw the movie ""THE HIDING PLACE""......very, very, VERY moving!"
5,Remarkable - Audiobook,"A wonderful book about a terrible time.If you have an interest in the horrors of the Nazis, you will enjoy this.If you have not already, read Anne Frank Remembered as well."
3,Good Christian book,"This book was a little slow and difficult to get in to at first, but the story is compelling. A very good lesson of what it means to be a Christian."
5,Great book,"I bought the book The Hiding Place because I had the lost the one I had. I greatly enjoyed the book. It is well written, and Historical. Her story is one that should never be forgotten. The book was in great shape when I got it."
4,The Hiding Place,Well documented life of a very special person. It shows up the tragedy of war and racism. It shows that Faith is so important in situations that Corrie finds herself in.
5,Amazing,This is an amazing story. I read it years ago and have just read it again. I got so much more from it this time! Everyone shouldjust sit down and enjoy it!
5,Great Read,Wonderful reminder of how blessed we are as Christians in America. It wasn't always this easy to be a Christian...
4,Amazing woman,"I have enormous respect for people who did what this family did during World War 2. Corrie managed to stay positive throughout her ordeal - an inspiration for all of us. The story was told well, easy to read, without ever being boring. Highly recommended"
5,One of the Greatest Narratives Ever Written,"The Ten Boom story will hopefully be read for eternity, as it constantly reminds us what happens when prejudices overcome common decency. The minority populations of Jews, gypsies, and disabled suffered greatly under the Nazi regime. This is how one family decided to respond to the crisis. They could have closed their door to the Jews, as many others did. In our society today, prejudices remain towards many who are different. As this book tells us, HOW we respond is the ultimate victory over evil."
5,Great read for High School students,It is one of those that is hard to put down. It is amazing how she endured such hardship and yet held on to her Lord and Savior. She is remarkable and we all need some of her gumption.
5,very inspirational,Great book. Very inspiring true story! I think everyone should have the opportunity to read this book. A very quick read.
5,Christian Inspiration,The story of Corrie Ten Booms family and their devotion to God and love for His people is truly inspiring and life changing.
5,review,i was so excited to find this book. i loved it as a kid but had lost my copy. the price was great and it was in great condition. well done.
5,Interesting Viewpoint,I had never heard or read an account of the Holocaust from a non-Jew point of view. This story brought the brutality of the times to life without preconceived opinions or prejudices towards the Germans or the Jews. A fresh take in an authentic voice. Great book!
5,"A classic, changes your paradigm","I read this first in the 70's and looking back, I can clearly see how it changed the course of my life in a very good way."
5,Great Book!,Awesome book. I read this book years ago and love reading it again and again. Corrie was a remarkable woman. This is truly faith in action. Have you been deeply wronged? Find it hard to forgive? Bitterness eating you up on the inside and killing you spiritually? Read this book. Learn how to forgive when someone has did something you feel is unforgivable. Truly inspiring.
5,A MUST read book,"Every American, no, every person, should read this book. Be prepared for life's side-tracks before they happen. And be optimistic."
3,don't read it in the morning,This was a interesting book. unless you like over forshadowing this book is preety poorly written. If you are impatient this book is not for you. It is really slow espesial in the begining. If you like a little death this is a good book. And if you have a true belife in God this enforces his miracles.
1,Such a bad book,I choose this review because the book sucked and i wish i never read it dont ever read this book
3,If you want a sad book read this one,"In my opinion, this book starts off very slow and very boring but when the raids it starts to get interesting. When she goes to the concentration camp it is very sad. And Betsie is very religious."
3,The hiding place,this book is a good book it is live with a lot of love I thought that this book was a sad book this book is a great book to read I would rate this book 3 starts because I thought the dairy of Anne Frank was better than this book but this book was better
3,Max from CA wrote:,This book is definatly not a book I would chose to read. Unfortunatle my 8th grade teacher made the whole class read it. The book was ok but it got really boring.
1,VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY SLOW PACED,"This book ""The Hiding Place"" by Corrie Ten Boom offers a great story, but the author's slow pacing makes it dull and boring. What can be said in 2 sentences is said in 4 paragraphs and I'm not kidding."
1,The Hiding Place,I was most impressed with the service of Amazon. I purchased the book online and had it sent to my Mom in Florida as part of a birthday present. The service and delivery time was very prompt! Excellent book; a must read! Five star rating out of five stars
2,"Love the Book, Hate the Shipping","The book took FOREVER to get here. I mean like, weeks. It was in good condition though."
3,Average Read....,"I am not sure whether half of the stories narrated are really true. The transformation from a frustrated small-town religious bigot to an ""underground"" heroine seems rather far-fetched. Too good to be true and please stop proselytizing; Jesus can be loved without being a Christian and those who don't beleive that are the biggest fools on earth!"
4,Powerfull,"The only reason that I chose to give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was slow to take off. In fact, the real story begins around page 77 in the chapter entitled ""Invasion"".""Whatever in our life is hardest to bear, love can transform into beauty."" This is the message that I took from this book; that one can have nothing -- including poor health -- and that hope can turn loss into glory, and that there really is a silver lining around each cloud."
4,The Hiding Place,"I picked up the Hiding Place through a promotion as it looked like an interesting story. It was slow to start but stick with it as it picks up, and I found myself desperate to find out more about Corrie and Betsie. I felt like Corrie had taken me to the prison and given me a first hand account. The story was sad - hard to believe human beings would treat others like that - but really got me interested.It was quite religious - and even though I'm not - I found this wasn't a turn off as in some books. It was such a big part of Corrie and Betsie's lives that it actually made me think."
5,A lesson in love and forgiveness,I read this book when I was 17. I started reading it in the evening and the first time I looked up I had finished the book and the sun was just coming up. An amazing book that does not leave the reader the same after the experience of reading it.
5,You Will Not Be The Same After Reading This Book,"I first picked up ""The Hiding Place"" in 1989, following the death of my brother. I read it from cover to cover in one evening, then read it again in the next two days. ""The Hiding Place"" is not only a thrilling tale, set in the midst of war torn, Nazi occupied Holland, it is a spiritual journey of one woman and one family. You will feel as if you know Corrie, as if you are visiting with her in your own home. You'll feel every indignity she suffered and rejoice with every triumph. Your heart will break for her and her sister Betsie and your spirit will sing with them also. If you want to read a book that will change your life forever then you must read ""The Hiding Place"". If I was able to choose only three books to cherish for the remainder of my life on earth I would choose the Bible, ""Hinds Feet on High Places"" by Hannah Hurnard and Corrie Ten Boom's ""The Hiding Place"". I cannot wait to meet you in heaven Corrie."
5,Daughter had to read for school...glad I read it too!,My 8th grader had to read this for a school assignment and I'd never read it so I decided to read it as well since it was an ebook and I could access it too. I love reading historical novels so I knew I'd probably enjoy it and I did! Would highly recommend for all ages!
5,Inspiration,Loved READING this book again after reading when I was a young adult. She continues to inspire me to commit more to serving others. Anyone that is interested in God's grace will enjoy this story.
5,No other book has impacted me as this one...,What I have learned in this book has directly and indirectly been used throughout many years of my life. No other story has affected me like The Hiding Place. It has been such an encouragement; and how blessed I am to know about the ten Boom family and Corrie's testimony! Her books and videos have had a profound impact on me and countless others.
5,A Must Read,"This book is based upon the true account of Corrie Ten Boom who suffered under the Nazi Regime and was placed in a concentration camp for helping the Jews during this dark period in world history. The story is told from a Christian perspective and provides a detailed account of the horrors and injustices committed during Hitler's reign. This book is encouraging in that it proves that even in the most dreadful of circumstances, humans are capable of acting in a noble manner as did Ten Boom. It also serves as a stark reminder of what can happen when people are not vigilant and shows the danger of using the media to control the ""masses"" as Hitler and his minions did during his short reign in Germany. Indeed, this danger is now greater than ever due to the nature of modern technology and the potential that exists for abuse on the part of depraved individuals. I highly recommend this book."
5,Beutiful story!,"Corrie Ten Boom's autobiography is a very well written story of family life and the help and hope Corrie and her family brought to different people, of different religions, and of different nationalities. It is a beautiful and very descriptive story about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel!"
5,good so far,i have only begun to read this book. Corrie Ten Boom was a tremendous woman of faith in the Lord!!
5,God is Great!,"I loved this book! I was required to read it for school and at first I thought I wouldn't like it, but the more I got into it, the more I did enjoy it. The book really reminds us that God really is in control of our lives and his timing is perfect! The fact that they released her from prison was a mistake on the German's part. They weren't supposed to have released her. If she hadn't been released, a week later she would have been put into a gas chamber and died. God works in mysterious ways!!"
5,A wonderful story of hope,"This is a great book! Even in the mist of a Nazi concentration camp, Corrie and her sister find the strenth from God to preach His word and to forgive their oppressers. It is a wonderful testimony that we all have a plan and that everything happens for a reason and that we should give praise for all things, good and bad!"
5,Read this book!,This book is incredible. You have to read it. I have never read such an inspiring book on World War II.
5,Exceedingly encouraging for anyone living in troubled times,"Corrie's experiences and how God carried her through will remind Christians that no matter what we ever face, God will be with us and give us strength to endure. I have many times told people about Corrie and how her story gives comfort that we can trust God through every storm, no matter how horrendous. I highly recommend everyone read her story."
2,Disappointed,The book was not how it is shown. It had a white cover and smaller harder to read. I was disappointed
5,The Ultimate Hiding Place,"This is a beautifully written, poignant book about a Christian woman who discovers God's neverending love and grace can bring her through the most difficult of circumstances, even a Nazi concentration camp. Filled with sweet stories of her youth, these lessons she draws on for strength later as she realizes nothing happens outside the soverign will of God; they were meant to help carry her through a time of testing where she found the ultimate Hiding Place."
4,Deeply inspiring book.,"An extraordinary testament to the power of mind and spirit, here deployed to survive and indeed defeat the worst Nazi atrocities -- perpetrated by socialist barbarians masquerading as a civilized society. One feels literally strengthened by reading and then further reflecting on this powerful story."
5,Hiding Place,"This book was both inspiring and frightening, to think of man's crulity to man was painful, but it also deepened my love for Jesus Christ."
5,The Hiding Place,I loved this book. It tells of the courageous life of Corrie TenBoom. It is very uplifting and yet sad. She was such a wonderful Christian lady!
5,Lyrical form,"One of the best books I have ever read. From the first page I was drawn into this world completely and never looked back. One of those rare books that I was devastated to have end, and moped around for months afterward with nothing to read because I knew nothing would be able to equal it. Miz Shange's lyrical prose is incomparable, beautiful and devastating in it's ability to make an intimate connection with the reader. I consider it a 'Must' read.If you ever have a chance to see Ntozake Shange read in person, which I have, don't miss the opportunity. She is as rare and wonderful as her writing."
5,a read I long remember,"this book left a lasting impression on me, and as I was just reminded of it, I wanted to excite other people's interest in a joyous read. after and while reading about the lovely 3 sisters, my daughter and I invented 3 puppets and called them by the sister's names. Perhaps I remember and recommend this book because it is one you can enjoy with an adolescent."
5,Lenox is always quality,These are lovely quality napkins rings. They go perfectly with my Christmas table setting. Nice to have during the holidays.
4,Napkin rings,I am not real excited about napkin rings. Saw them on sale and didn't have any so thought I would buy them for special occasions. Not excited but not disappointed.
4,Interesting Social Commentary,Not a single character is likeable because we see their weakness and prejudice. That said there is some truth in each of the characters. Sure the sterio types are obvious but it says as much for the time this was written as it offends todays sensibilities. I liked the story because of it's period ideas. I grew up in the time frame of this story and although stilted it did give me some of the feel of the time and how far we have come.
1,Contradictory and dated,"I was amazed that this author, who wrote about the injustice of racial prejudice, referred to homosexuals in this book as ""limp-wristed."" All my respect for what she was trying to achieve went right out the window. What an ignoramus."
1,Have not received it,"Whoever has my book, hope he/she enjoys it. I borrowed it from the library and finally decided to buy it."
5,Excellent Blu-ray of an Argento Classic,"Don't listen to that other reviewer. This is the full length, uncut Italian version of Phenomena that is longer than all other versions of the movie. There are a few brief scenes that weren't even on the Anchor Bay DVD. Since they were never dubbed, they are presented on this Blu-ray in Italian with subtitles. The picture quality is very good - perhaps they used a little DNR, but it looks very sharp on my TV. The extras include an almost hour-long documentary. It's definitely the best available edition of this film, which continues to polarize Argento fans. Personally, it's always been a favorite of mine. If you love Phenomena, do not hesitate to buy this great release."
4,A Unique Horror Movie from the Master of Horror Cinema,"Dario Argento is a brilliant filmmaker whose well of creativity is seemingly bottomless. Phenomena is a spooky tale of a young girl (Jennifer Connelly) who moves into a boarding house while a serial killer is on the loose. The daughter of a famous actor, Jennifer's character has a hard time fitting in with the other girls, especially after the other girls find out she sleep-walks, witnesses murders in her dreams, and communicates with insects. The movie plays like IT'S a dream and Argento uses his camera to increase this illusion. The murder scenes are done from the perspective of the killer so all you see of the murderer is a hand wearing a black glove. It's a good movie, but not Argento's best (I liked Opera & Tenebre better), which is why I gave it four stars. See it for some original scares."
5,Creepers: Possibly the best horror film of the 1980's,"Creepers is special in a very important way: it's one of the few truly scary and entertaining horror films to come out in the 1980's. Jennifer Connelly is superb in her role as a girl who is friends with insects. A chilling heavy metal soundtrack, including bits from Iron Maiden's Powerslave album, enhances each and every terrifying scene. Donald Pleasance is perfect in one of his many roles in a great horror film. Overall, this film is great. A Warning for the queasy: An overblown vomiting scene is included. Rated R for violence, mature themes, profanity and gore."
3,Fully restored Phenomena delivers the goods.,"Phenomena (aka Creepers)was my least favorite Argento film. Having only seen the heavily editted version (28 minutes missing), I was misled. Although the basic premise of the film is laughable, it somehow still works. The fine acting, incredible camera work and hypnotic soundtrack make the movie eminently watchable and entertaining. The murders are also quite gory in typical Argento fashion. The restored DVD is awesome and well worth getting... although the opening murder is a bit grainy looking. The disc also has some nice extras including an interview with Mr. Argento himself."
5,Cruesome and Atmospheric,One of argento's greatest works finally in it's entirety. Has great atmosphere and some gruesome scenes along with one of the most unexpected endings in horror cinema.
2,Sorry Dario this one stank,"Alright I'm a big fan of the guy, but Phenomena just didn't impress me. The acting was pretty bad, the story just doesn't make much sense, not a lot of his cool shots, not a lot of gore until the end and it has a monkey smarter then everybody else. But there was a couple of cool scenes throughout the film. I guess the story was my main problem, just didn't buy it, but it might be your cup of tea."
2,Horrors fans only,"Occasionally I watch a gross-out horror movie, if I like the actor and it has high reviews. I tend to forget that the high reviews always come from horror fans.And I have yet to see such a movie that was really good by ordinary film standards. This is no exception. Basically the story and logic is sacrificed for cheap horror effects, like maggot-eaten faces.The one good thing about it is Jennifer Connelly, who even at this tender age was the prettiest thing on two legs."
1,ave goat a munkey butler,"hullo. ma name is donald pleasance and am in this movie as an entymologist - that means a like wee beasties and a study them n that. ave goat a wee monkey as ma nurse (dinnae wurry, she disnae gie me bedbaths or anything lik that. a point ma wee red laser light it sumthing and the wee monkey fella goes and gits it fur me). oh aye, did a mention that am from bonnie scotland in this film? anyway, ma wee pal jennifur is a wee marvel cause she can communicate with aw the wee beasties and they help her find cloos aboot aw the murders that r goin on. ave goat tae say that wee jennifur does a marvellous joab pullin this wan aff. so if ye like daft films an that and ye set yer sights low a think you'll quite enjoy this guff. hoots mon, goat tae go noo as ma wee monkey needs to poo poo. see ya."
5,An absolute must for cult horror fans!,"It's not Dario Argento's best film by far but it is his most eccentric. A visually stunning mad-as-a hatter-supernaturnal-fairy tale complete with razor-wielding monkeys, mutants and madmen. Is it good? Well, you really have to have a palette for this type of film--it's different, strange, beautiful and weird.A good DVD too."
2,Stalking Killer Leaves Bug Trail...,"There are mysterious disappearances of young girls in the Swiss Alps and the police have recovered a victim's head covered with maggots. When the young Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly) arrives to the Richard Wagner Boarding School for girls, she seems to have problems adjusting and she also has a problem with sleepwalking. One night when she has woken up from her sleepwalking, she is brought to Professor John McGregor's residence by his assistant. She finds out that Professor McGregor is an entomologist and she has an ability to communicate with insects. Together, these two skills seem to be very helpful in the search for the killer of young girls. Phenomena is a film that looses its audience due to its weak story, but might keep some folks attention with its gruesome and creepy effects."
3,Interesting movie,"Interesting movie with good gore, and death scenes. Jennifer Connelly is a great actress. The setting is also spoody, and the special affects are superb."
2,"Unsettling, quirky, and peculiarly charming, but not good","Low budget Italian horror with an American star.Good? No.Unsettling, quirky and peculiarly charming? Yes.Worth the time it takes to watch it? No."
4,Typical but well done Argento flick,"For those familiar with the filmmaker, the overall atmosphere, plot and musical score will be instantly recognizable. It's a bit weak in some areas like sound editing, but the acting and development of the movie helped compensate for such flaws. If you're a Jennifer Connelly fan, you'll enjoy seeing her as a very young actress."
5,My favorite Argento film,"In my opinion, Phenomena is Argento's most under rated film and it's easily my favorite. What I really enjoyed about it was that it has a surreal, dreamlike quality and builds a disorienting, creepy atmosphere. What other film can boast a murderous dwarf, swarming insects, a sleepwalker who can talk to bugs, piles of maggots and a razor-weilding monkey? Jennifer Connolly is very easy on the eyes, and the soundtrack moves from a moody score by the Goblins to 80s hair metal, giving it an appropriate amount of cheese and livening things up a bit. The end chase scene / climax of the movie is also pretty shocking. Like nearly all of his other movies, the dialogue is stilted and the plot a bit incoherent, but Connolly gives the lead role some charisma and the movie looks great; no one goes to see this kind of movie for a logical plot and taut, snappy dialogue anyway. A very good film, and much more of a fairy tale than any of Argento's other movies; I highly recommend it."
4,"monkeys, maniacs, mutants, and creepy crawlies by the ton","What more could you want from a horror movie? A pretty schoolgirl who commands armies of insects, a knife wielding serial killer, a deformed boy kept chained to a wall in the attic, a vengeful helper monkey with a razor blade, Donald Pleasence, delirious camerawork, blindingly gorgeous cinematography, pulsating music, characters who behave strangely for no particular reason, lots of pockets of glowing blue light (see where X-Files got some of their aesthetic ideas), surreally graphic violence, beautiful scenery, it's all right here. Sure, it's not Dario Argento's best work, but it's his most eccentric. Besides, why not watch a real horror film instead of Scream?"
5,"Dario's favorite, and one of mine, too","Many people call this one of Dario's weakest films, yet it is Dario's favorite. I loved it, as well. It feels like one long, frightening, beautiful dream where anything that can happen does happen.The plot revolves around Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly), the daughter of an international movie star who is sent to a Swiss boarding school for education. While getting settled in, she learns of a murderer killing girls in the area. Also, we learn that she can communicate with insects.That night, she has a sleepwalking attack, and witnesses something before ending up at the home of John McGregor (Donald Pleasence). The two become friends, as more people die and Jennifer's school think she has gone insane.This film was my introduction to Dario's work and I have been a fan ever since. I believe Tenebrae would be a better introduction to Dario, but this is still a wonderful film. Check it out."
4,"Phenomena, indeed.","This movie is crazy. It is weird. It is an acid trip through the Italian country, with Jennifer Connelly in the middle of it.Wow. I watched this late one night thinking that I was getting something different and I was not disappointed. Argento is known for his gross out horror and he goes full out with this one. The music is heavy metal and the visuals beautiful such a combination is pretty interesting especially once the killing begins.The extras on this are very informative and just as off the wall as the movie. For the money you spend on this you almost feel like you are making an investment in art. It will get better and more valuable with time, trust me, they don't make'em like this anymore."
5,fun and innovative,ive heard few styles like jamie t. hes fun and innovative as well as being comically a british tramp. the music like a mix of ska and rap. even though his lyrics are fast and it seems like nonsense hes actually pretty coherent and intelligible in his lyrics so unlike many other rap-style singers.
2,Nothing exceptional,"I bought this CD because I'd heard ""Sheila"" on XM radio's Upop station. I love that song, and still do, but the rest of this CD certainly did not impress me much.It's a lot of yelling, none of it reminded me of that great single, and the music was no where near wonderful. If you like music that makes you feel tense and angry after hearing it then go ahead and buy this. Otherwise, download the single and forget about these guys."
5,Moraito is the BOMB!,"I decided to check out Moraito due to Richard Brune's ravings (the famous guitar builder and guitarist). I am speechless, this is really pure flamenco but also very virtuosic and filled with a modern approach. I would recommend this to people who are into Sabicas, Paco, and stuff like Tomatito, but wouldn't recommend it to people who just want to buy some Rumba dance stuff (not that there is anything worng with that...) Beautiful album and a shame that outside of Spain he is rather obscure..."
5,Brilliant little hardback - A Pre-Raphaelite delight,"This well produced hard-back from 1978 has wonderful reproduced illustrations dating back to Edward Moxon's illustrated version of Tennyson's Poems. In 1857 E. Moxon published his illustrated volume of Alfred Lord Tennyson's poems with fifty-five illustrations by various artists. Those by the Pre-Raphaelite artists, Rossetti / Millais and Holman Hunt are all reproduced in this fine little hard-cover book. Edward Moxon was a poetry lover and had a long association with Alfred Lord Tennyson. The price at publication was 32/- a massive sum at the time.The book features lovely, B&W; prints of: Recollections of Arabian Nights; The Lady of Shallot, Godiva; Sir Galahad, and many more. A delightful thing to own and now very hard to find. Excellent volume."
2,Careful of the sizing.,The jacket is nice but the size was off. I wear a xxl in shirts but usually an xl or so in outerware. Just to be on the safe side I ordered this as a XXL but it was still snug. A nice jacket and good value for what I paid but just order a size or even two larger.
2,Stiff,"I didn't like the jacket. The size was off, and the cut was awkward -- the size didn't match the arm length. It was stiff, not cloth-like and confortable. It was likely weatherproof, but felt more like the rainslicker I had as a little kid than somethingI'd wear now."
4,Funky Rocky Blues,Love this guy's sound. His voice reminds me a little of William Topley from The Blessing (UK) and also Taj Mahal. His guitar work is full of color and texture. The only bad things I would say about this disc is that it's a little uneven and only about 37 minutes long.
3,Good Value!,"I was pretty happy with the watch. The packaging is nice however, the quality of the materials is not as I expected."
5,America Unplugged,"This live colection is a two-man 'unplugged' effort - just Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell, two voices and two acoustic guitars (or one guitar and piano in some instances) - but the sound is surprisingly full given the sparse instrumentation. The set draws heavily on the first two America albums from the early 70s when they were a trio (Dan Peek's been absent for thirty years now) but the songs still work wonderfully in spite of that missing voice. And the fun part is - you can add your own part to re-create the original three-part harmonies. If you've ever been a fan, you'll enjoy this."
5,Great acoustic concert in HDCD!,"For those that care, this cd is encoded as a HDCD, so if you have a HDCD compatible player, this album just sparkles!Anyway, it is a great recording and performance of just Gerry and Dewey on acoustic guitars and piano. You will not miss the band, these guys can do it all! A very special recording.I don't know why record labels don't label HDCD's as such when they sell them."
4,The Grand Cayman Concert,I like America and this was great cd. It brough out the true voices of America. Anyone who likes America will enjoy this cd.
1,Not Fit for Consumption,"Boettner's book presents to the world some of the sloppiest scholarship on record. The cited references to scripture do not in many cases actually support the author's claims. Citations to those passages from scripture which do not supportive the predestinationst polemic are absent, leaving the reader with no informed way to decide."
3,decent but not great,Some of the girls just tease you while others have no problem showing off their naked bodies. Overall it does the job though.
2,Probably the closest you'll get to hardcore on her.,"I had a friend show me this a while back and believe me this isn't hardcore or anything, but its a lot closer to it than Girls Gone Wild. There isn't any actual Sex in it but it does show a LOT of vagina. Don't get your hopes up yet though. Most of the girls aren't that hot and a lot of their vaginas aren't the best looking either. ESPECIALLY the chick on the front, Kobe or whatever. Hers in the worst. But if you're desperate and actually want to fork over money for grade F quality ""pornography"" than by all means."
1,Don't bother!,Boring video for a couple. All it is some girls stripping in front of the camera. No imagination. No story at all. Watched it once and threw it out.
2,Works well for one season then dies,Two years ago I bought one of these units. It worked great for one season. The next winter I followed the setup instructions and started up the unit. The unit heated up for about a minute then gave me the the dreaded two light error. The unit had died. I called Holmes and was told that the problem could not be fixed.Last winter I went out and bought another unit. It worked well throughout the winter season. At the end of the season I followed the cleaning / storage instructions and put it away.This morning I setup the humidifier and got the dreaded two light error again. One bad unit is a freak. Two units produced in different years is a more serious problem.Don't buy this unit if you want more than 1 year of use out of it.
2,Works great- not pro grade,"I've owned 4 of these angle finders. Unfortunately that the problem. I've had to buy 4 of these because they self destruct after about a year of use. The last one was replaced by Bosch and the replacement broke 3 months later. This all stems from a spinning gyroscope in the apex of the gauge. Even slight concussions can interrupt this. It also appears from careful examination of the broken protractors that they use sub standard glues to hold the moving parts in place. This may mean that the device cannot handle high temperatures. Which happens when you leave it in a work box or truck. I keep buying them because they work great and I can't fabricate metal without them, but this is is not a durable product."
5,Bosch Digital Protractor,I bought this tool because of a remodel job on my house. I am not disappointed. I have been using use it to transfer angles from roof peaks onto my miter saw. I have not used the crown-molding option yet. I wish this tool could automatically divide an angle when measuring an angle. Dividing by two is not a big deal but it would speed things up a bit. This is one well-made tool. A lot heavier duty than I expected. The more I use it the more I appreciate it.
1,Lousy unreliable tool,"I bought this tool in June 2008 it worked fine. Then recently it stopped working properly. The tool would give me the angle measurement, but not the miter, bevel or spring. I thought it might be the batteries, so I put new ones in. This did not solve the problem. It was the electronics in the tool it self. Every time I pressed the button to get these measurements the tool would display three dashes on the screen. So finally I decided to pack up the tool and send it to Bosch. It was still under warranty, but it was a hassle just the same. Bosch told me they could not fix it and would send me a new one, fine. I finally get the tool back and want to use it to finish my project, press the button to get the miter angle and again it is doing the same thing as before, what a lousy tool. This tool was not cheap, and I expect it to work when I need it to. I thought Bosch was known for quality, now the only thing I think they stand for is unreliability and aggravation. Buyer beware!"
5,Bosch Angle Finder,"I love the accuracy of the angle finder. For non 90 degree corners, it allows me to choose between coping the trim on an inside corner or offsetting my miter saw from 0 degrees. For outside corners this angle finder makes the world of difference."
5,The Apple iPod is Amazing!,"It all started a few weeks ago when I was flipping through channels and landed on CNN. There was Steve Jobs talking about his new iPod for Windows. I couldn't belive my ears. Now, I'm not a Mac user, and generally dispise anything with that stupid apple on it, but the iPod is perhaps the greatest product Apple has ever created. The iPod has it all, it has good sound quality, it isn't that big, it is very easy to use, and it can carry thousands of your MP3s! Apple is one of the companies that supports your digital music rights!"
1,If your a yuppie with a wallet deeper than the oceanitsgreat,Apple iPod is a total waist of money. No way is it worth more than 200 dollars. If you want a good mp3 player you can get one for less than 200. The Arthos 10gb studio jukebox holds 2x the standard capacity of the ipod 5 and costs 1/2 as much. Also the firewire is a pain in the behind its just more money you have to throw away. Get another brand that is designed for windows. The only thing i liked about it before i replaced it was the LCD with 6 lines that was hot. But that doesnt add up. Dont buy it save your money for something better.
1,i love apple but not this apple,the apple ipod 10 gb is alot better it is more classier for people that want one but want to save the 5 gb is right for them
1,Ipod for windws is horrible,"I just recieved the iPod for windows for christmas, it was the worst gift that i recived this year, and it was supposed to be my favorite. It took days to get the hardware to work, and then the software wouldn't install. Using music match Jukebox 7.1 is stupid. You can't get it anywhere anymore and it wouldn't install from the disk. They should have makde the plug-in for 7.5 also. I just could not get it to work and it was a waste of time. Now I'm getting a new mp3 player by a company who makes their own programs and i'm never buying anything form apple again. Windows users should all be advised that Apple doesn't care about us. Don't buy the iPod."
2,think twice,"I bought my ipod new 1 year and 1 month ago and it has simply stopped working. After days of trying everything in the knowledge base and being blown off by the 'applecare' staff I went to an authorized apple repair service who told me to just forget about it and buy a new one and save the repair expense. He also said to be sure to get a case for it and handle it very carefully because if you happen to drop it or even lay it down on a hard surface with too much gusto, kiss it goodbye. It was swell while it lasted but I can spend a lot less on a disposable product."
5,A Superb Document on How to Approach the Vietnam Battlefield,"The number of people who have actually sat down and provided specific advise on how to tactically approach combat in Vietnam is exceedingly small. Plenty of literature out there on ""this happened to us"" or ""that happened to us"" but almost none on how to actually move and fight."
1,JUNK,You can live with the clicking noise when it switches from PSTN to VOIP but you cannot live with the horrible noise and static on the VOIP line. It does not work with Yahoo Messenger either. Get something else!
5,"""My Review Here""","Ranging from metal to regae, this CD is great for all ages and all musical interests. They have done a great job of blending together all different styles of music into 12 great ska songs. My favorite song is ""Springer"" which pokes fun at america's new favorite show displaying hicks, strippers, and violence. This CD is a must have for anybody that likes music. Especially good music."
3,Not a one time read,"This book is a reference book that should be in your library, it is not a one time read. It goes into Mendels laws of inheritance which, although simplified genetics, is about the best a lay person can use. Gives an honest look at inbreeding/linebreeding/outbreeding. I first borrowed it from the library, and then had to buy it.The reason I only gave it three stars is because it is mainly for toy dog breeders. The author seems to consider anything over 20 pounds as a ""large breed"". Also the author considers cropping ears as barbaric, yet thinks you should put a miss-marked puppy down at birth. Considering the amount I've seen markings change from birth to adulthood I think only a pup with a congenital defect should be put down at birth. Anyway, a mis-marked puppy makes as good a pet dog as one with excellent markings."
2,"Overall, not a good book for beginners!","While this book did have some good information, much of it was outdated and in serious need of an overhaul! The vaccination section is antiquated at best. I found serious fault with the writer's view on ""barbaric"" ear cropping but she seems ok with ""culling"" newborn puppies for mismarking! A new breeder would be better off with another information source. Those already with a solid background in breeding/showing will find useful information in this book."
2,I've had better,I wanted a stove-top cappuccino maker that I could put in the dishwasher. I think the aluminum ones are better. I just don't care for the way this one handles.
4,... Nice combat,"Both games (Diablo, and Diablo II) have some nice combat, smooth spells, and mice enemies and there seems to be a lot of it. It has specialty/magic items for you to enhance your gameplay. Even the online gameplay is rather smooth... and free... virtually any product by blizzard is worth your money and this is no exception."
1,Hope you enjoy grinding.,"Expect to grind for countless hours if you want to clear bosses. Each act contains six quests (often overlapping) and then a final act boss. The act quests are reasonably challenging without being too frustrating, but act bosses will kill you in sometimes one, usually two shots unless you grind for an obscenely long time to get a few levels.Example: I played without grinding to the end of act 2, coming to the final boss with a Level 23 Druid with 146 hit points. The boss has (on the EASIEST difficulty) no less than 4,000 hit points and routinely does over 100 points of damage on a single strike. I have no desire to grind for days upon days to get to level 30, and so I have uninstalled the game to free hard drive space for something better."
1,this is for kids with fast eye hand coordination,"i was given this set as a birthday gift, because I'd mentioned several years ago I enjoyed MYST. Well, where MYST required thinking and reasoning as your main requirements, this Diablo stuff is mainly a blood and gore kill or be killed game. I am in my early 40's and apparently lack the eye hand coordination to fight ""monsters"". I was very disappointed."
4,Oldie but Goodie,I had to re-buy this game because my original version wouldn't play on Vista. This version is still has glitches and takes forever to load but is still worth it if you are a Diablo fan.
4,Not bad for an oldie,I bought this game for my husband who has been a Diablo fan since its inception. He still loves to play it either alone or with friends with the multi-player option. The versitility is what makes this game unique and enjoyable.
2,Where is Diablo 2? what do I do with this??,"This game itself s great, I have played it before and was looking forward to getting this chest when I ordered it. However, for whatever reason the box only had Lord of Destruction, THE EXPANSION... its basically useless without the actual game so there goes my money -_-."
3,Why so pricey? But still great.,"As an avid fan of Blizzard games, and previous owner of D2 and LOD who had lost his CDs, I was hoping Blizzard would reduce the price more considering D3 should be rolling out relatively soon -Diablo III(Although considering how long it took them for SC2 that prediction may be premature). With that said, if you are into RPGs I still, and always have recommend this game. The variety of characters and large interactive bnet gaming community for both PvM and PvP allow for a great deal of enjoyable play. Three stars are for the price, I'd give five stars for the actual game."
5,diablo II battlechest,"i was very happy with this product. it runs very well, no glitchs or hiccups. was pleased that it was the new version."
5,Please take it away...,"Ok, being an RPG fan, I was pretty much dissapointed with the first release of Diablo. It offered very little in the ways of options that most of us RPG'ers are used to handling around, but with the second release, it's a totally different story. The whole game had an overhaul, where to get rid of it I had to move my home PC to the office to avoid playing it. It is the worse addiction I have had in my life. I am now under therapy. Thank you."
1,"Hackers control the game, not you","So I buy this game thinking it must be good based on the reviews, but what they don't tell you is that hackers now run the game. In hardcore mode (where you when you die your character is lost) hackers use a hack called TPPK which allows them to kill you instantly without even realizing what happened. Another extremely annoying thing is that sites that dupe or hack to create items jump into your games to announce they sell these items for real money and to go to their site to purchase them. Map hacks, dupe hacks, bot hacks, you name it. Blizzard does not care about this game, nor it's customers that purchased it. Save your money."
2,Game of Dupe.,"This was an awsome game. i brought this game 3 month ago, i have to admit i had alot of fun with it, and as i begin to become the richest guy of the game on the UsEast Realm. I realize that all the wealth i built are nothing but DUPES. Some unknown noob made a dupe program especially for this game, now the game is getting filled by duped items. the economy is now over flooded with fake items that will probably dissapear shortly after you get them from the others. BOTTOM LINE! this game was good, now its a crap. but if you just want to be a newbi with this game, then you should buy it. heheheh become expert on this game, it will get REAALLy boring. if you don't believe me go to www.Youtube.com : Search Keyword : [ diablo II dupe program ]"
5,Gangsta RPG,This game is good. especially da set! must have....*switches* thy foos better buy thee game before i whoopis your assies
1,Ridiculously Overpriced,"These games are excellent, but Diablo II was released in 2000, and the expansion was released in 2001. Diablo I is even older, and that game was little more than a stripped down clone of Rogue (a free, open source computer RPG) with some prerendered graphics added and a cheezy story.So in essence, the idea for the game is unoriginal, and the latest content in this package was released 7 years ago, which is fast approaching a decade. Yet, they want us to pay $40 for this. I'm sorry, but that makes absolutely no sense; at best this entire package could be valued at $20, though in all practicality it could be sold for less than that (republished as a $15 single-disc).Blizzard is ripping you off. Show them how you feel by not buying it--borrow it from a friend."
2,go away,it was delieverd with no problems. the game was in perfect codition the game and product key worked the expanshion was a pain and the game arived on time.
1,If I could get away the hours this game has stolen away from me,"This game is the most addicting game known to man. World of Warcraft has addicting reviews, but this game really took ahold of my life. I think I started playing since I was like 17 and stopped finally when I was about 23. I spent 10 hours a day playing this stupid game at least and some nights I spent all night without sleep playing it. It is a very fun game and I always wanted to get the next good weapon from a Diablo drop or something but I finally gave it up. A very fun game if you know what your limits are."
5,Amazing game,"Already owned Diablo 2 but was missing the serial from the original D2. Great game, can't wait for Diablo 3."
5,Great Value,"My personal opinion is I love this game, but there are several things you have to get over to enjoy this game1. THIS IS NOT AN RPG regardless of what anyone tells you, this is an action game with rpg elements thrown in, but you'll be fighting swarms of enemys in a mindless, but fun, point and click battles. If your looking for a good rpg go for baldurs gate 2 or neverwinter nights.2. The game is outdated, the graphics are awful by todays standards. So don't expect this to push the envelope graphically.however if your going to buy diablo 2 this is the pack to buy, you get everything for a low price."
5,DIablo II,"I am an old Diablo player, and i purchased this after having the craving to play again, and its been great all over. The package is fun, includes the original diablo which is memory lane as well, overall good purchase for the price"
5,Still the best after all these years.,"The only thing i wanted to mention to the other Mac gamers out there is that since Apple has dropped Rosetta from OS X Lion, this WILL NOT work. Works great in OS X 10.6. :)"
5,From a 14 yr old computer Nerd,"Ok this is probably the best deals I have ever seen! I cant emphasize this any more! Diablo1 alone cost [an amount] plus D2 which is [an amount] if you buy it anywhere eles. plus D2 expansion pack... altogether it comes out like [an amount]! but here you get it for [a low amount]! This has got to be the best game I have ever gotten.. Yeah.. its hard in later levels, but what fun would a game be if you beat it in only a week. DIablo 1 is good but Diablo2 is the best I would have to say...and the expansion pak makes it better. It is totaly worth the twenty bucks!"
4,"good, with some issues on an intel-based Macbook","Everybody knows Diablo - a great game!On a MacBook that I bought recently (it is Intel Core Duo-based, running OS X), I had to turn off OpenGL (use software graphics instead of hardware) to be able to play the game. There was no such problem with the StarCarft game.It still plays prefectly with these settings, which is not a great surprise as the game was optimized for much slower (Pentium 1 or G3) machines."
5,Diablo Astounds all,"Diablo is a very popular game by Blizzard Entertainment. This game is reccomended for people who like gore, like medival games, and like action/adventure. This game has good graphics and is fun for many people like my cousins."
5,Amazing Fun from a Timeless Game,"Diablo 1 is one of my favorite game of all time. I played it when it launched and loved it. I end up playing the game every couple of years and love it every time. I've bought this game 5 times now and haven't regretted the decision to buy, maybe i should take better care of the discs.Diablo 2 is a really fun game, while it isn't quite what diablo 1 is you can certainly lose yourself in the game and have a ton of fun playing it.Diablo 1 is a timeless game that screams to be played from time to time, it's fun every single time.Diablo 2 can be fun but is really just the bridge from Diablo 1 and World of Warcraft, I would opt for Diablo 1 or WoW."
1,Windows 8 Nightmare...otherwise on oldes OS its fun,"This review isn't based on the game itself, but more as a warning to those looking to play the game on newer machines. I have a brand new gaming laptop, and I ordered this game because it was fun back in the day. However, it has been a nightmare to run on Windows 8, when it does run. I had to go to the internet and search for workarounds, they worked, sometimes. Its just not worth the hassle. I ordered a newer game instead. Diablo 2 is fun, just not on Windows 8. I read the same comlaints online about Windows 7."
4,Great game,"This is the new version of Battlenet battle chest with Diablo2 and the expansion pack. It includes a ""strategy book"" instead of Diablo 1 in it. The original battlechest wouldnt run on my Windows 7 laptop but this version does seem to be ok. i still have Diablo 1 which I enjoy playing on an old XP machine. This is a great game that suckered me into buying Diablo 3 which is a joke. It looks more like a cartoon than a game."
3,Diablo 2,"wellllll? what do i say? if you're expecting high end graphics,...this is not the game for you. if you're expecting to have ground level view, it won't happen. best you get is 800 x 600 screen. you can forget a decent in game screen capture.this game takes me back to atari and commodore 64 days. why did i buy it? for giggles, mainly. do i like it? well? it's kinda cute. especially since i never got to see diablo 1. i find it interesting to play. it's a new adventure for me. something i have never ever done. i find it a bit difficult to grasp, since i cannot get far away from the base-camp. since it's free,..what the hell, i'm not paying for it online. now if blizzard can just get diablo 3 put out?"
