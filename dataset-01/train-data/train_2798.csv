5,Player and headphones only.,"As has been mentioned in other reviews on this product, there is not any extra space in this case. But it does protect the unit from any form of external abuse. Would hold an extra microSD card but just about any thing will accomodate one of those. Will handle player in leather case, lanyard, ear bud phones and cleaning cloth, which is everything that comes with the kit. If you buy adapters, plan on getting a different carrying case to accomodate."
1,Screen cracked. Bad placement of logo,"Well, my daughter had an e250 in this case in her backpack and the screen cracked which Sandisk says is not covered under warranty. The logo on the front of this case also protrudes into the inner part which just happens to match perfectly were the crack in her sansa was. I would not buy this if your plan is to protect your mp3 player.BTW, her eyeglasses have been put in her backpack dozens of time and never cracked. Why? Because they were in a case much like this one was supposed to be. What I think is a design flaw Sandisk thinks is my dumb luck. Buyer Beware."
4,Great for on the GO,"I like the case very much. It is durable. The only problem I had was the clasp for the lanyard broke that came w/ it. I grabbed a different one I have at home so no biggie. Great protection for the mp3 player and carrying case. Sometimes, I wish it came in a different color so I could ""find"" it when I set it down in the house or in the car, but I like black anyway ...just a thought."
3,some tweaks needed,"I like the Idea of the modular sleeve and padded case. With the player in the sleeve it all fits nice and snug to avoid jostling. Didn't give enough room for a straight headphone jack while in case, though. Also would like to see an access hole to be able to plug it in through the closed case. The ""accessory pouch"" is good for the cleaning cloth but when trying to store earbuds in there, they get squished by the player. They should have made it just a bit thicker. For the money, this isn't to bad of protection until SanDisc starts coming out with more accessories. If anyone is listening, wouldn't mind something waterproof for kayaking."
2,2-piece not really 5-piece kit,"Case is too small. I couldn't find a way to put anything in the pocket and close the case. This kit has only 2 useful pieces: the leather glove, and anti-scratch screen."
3,handy protection for your Sansa,"Once you open the box, you can probably say ""This is it?"". It actually didnt live up to my expectations; thinking it would have a more glamorous finish and feel. But instead it ended up looking like a cheap product made in China. But, since I used it, I found that it delivered its promise. It did protect my Sansa e270 and is sleek and can get in even the smallest of bags. Maybe what this product lacks is more space to put your earphones in; but its not a big setback. On the overall, its quite great to have to pamper your Sansa."
5,love it,Love the travel case. It has a hard cover exterior that protects the mp3 player from Sansa. It has a place for the ear bugs & I love the smaller protected leather glove.
2,Waste of money for me.,"I never used it, and really didnt need it. I thought that I would, but the mp3 player came with a soft velvet case, so this wasnt necessary. Wish I had known.It was never defective though."
3,Functional and bulky,Bought this mainly to protect Sansa from my 6 year olds abuse. It servers it purpose. But the case or the kit is very unattractive and bulky. It takes all the coolness of Sansa off.
4,nice product,"I got this for my daughter who cracked the screen on her previous MP3 player. It looks sturdy enough, but is not too big. Should prevent damage when shoved into the backpack with everything else. Not sure I would have paid the $30 they wanted for it at Best Buy, but the Amazon price made it worthwhile."
5,Best Deal for with a Low Price,"I read some reviews before purchasing this product and I was a bit skeptical because some people had complaints. I got it anyway and I am so glad that I did. The mp3 player fits really nice and snug in the travel case and the additional leather case is perfect. When the player is in the leather case, it allows for the ear plugs and the usb cord to fit without moving anything. You also have easy access to all the keys. If you do not want to spend too much money but still want good quality, this is just the travel case for you."
4,good kit,"It's a good kit, specially the leather glove and anti-scratch screen. The leather glove fit perfectly to the device and make it feel it more secure"
4,"Nice case, Protects Player","This is a very nice case, and a good value for the price. It's hard sides protect my player in case it would get dropped or tossed around. It's a bit large to just carry around on the included lanyard, but it fits very nicely into my messenger bag, which can get knocked about, and I just thread the earphone cord through a designated earphone hole in the bag. For those who are traveling and want a sturdy case in which to keep their player and for those who want to use the player while biking, etc where it might get knocked about, this case is well worth the price."
4,Very elegant,These are very classy and very fragile. Broke one in the first week. We do use them alot though. We're more careful with them now. I don't like hand washing but these are worth the extra effort. We also bought the red & white wine glases. Very happy with our purchase.
5,"Great Follow-up to ""If the Ring fits""",It's Kelsey Armstrong Waters wedding coordinator to the stars and the only person Will Addison's family wants to plan a secret wedding for his sister Faith Starr (well known) actress. Kelsey has dealt with Faith three times before and doesn't want to have anything to do with this one until Will can convince her otherwise. They views on love clashes from the start. She contradictory to her job is a cynic and he is the ultimate romantic. Going to family resort to plan the wedding things begin to heat up for the two. They both have pasts they need to recover from. Love has a way working through the pasts. It is one enjoyable read.
3,short and dated,"This book definitely shows its age, published in 1992 and focused on the main crime gangs at the time of writing in the most general fashion - it told me very little that I did not know already from watching television shows and movies. While the information is reasonable, it's just not insightful 16 years on."
1,Don't buy this product,"Bought this product along with the ""Ware Cactus Carpeted Scratch Post, 32-Inch:Ware Manufacturing Kitty Cactus Carpeted Scratch Post, 32-Inch. While the Cat Supplies Carpet Cat Post 32 was more expensive, it was sub-par in quality. It starting fraying immediately and looks shabby. The Ware product is much, much better and cost less. Don't waste your money....get the Ware post if you are in the market."
4,Good book in changing times,Things are changing fast in BiH. Roads that describe as footpaths can now be reached by car (village of Lukomir )Even though this book is the only one available for the traveler in Bosnia & Hercegovina.The book is updated to year 2004 and this is quite good.I also lack the names of places to be writen in kerilic letters like in other books.
3,The best for now,This book was recommended to me by someone living in Bosnia. It seems to be the best guide book for that area at this time. I have since found a web site that is nearly as good a starting place but has BETTER maps on the site. I would say that subsequent editions will only improve the information content.
3,Well You Do Not Have Much of a Choice,"This is the only updated guide on the area so there it might be pointless to comment on it. I'd definitely buy it because the region is quite poor on information anyway. But a lot of time the book is limited and the maps are usually quite useless.I tried doing to walking tour in Mostar and also looked for some locations mentioned in Sarajevo in vain. Sometimes the author mentions streetnames which are not usually marked, some locations he talks about are impossible to find without asking people.On the positive side, the author is not some dude with a backpack visiting the country. He lives in BiH and has a lot of first hand information. I wish he would share more of it with us."
2,Pictures are Deceiving,"I purchase this light fixture for my little girls nursery thinking that it would give it a charming feel. After my husband installed it, he said ""you should have thought about spending a little more than $50 to get something that didn't look so cheap. This fixture isn't even straight"". When I told him the actual cost, he was quite upset and felt we got ripped off.Because I don't have the energy to deal with it, we're going to leave it in place. It does provide adequate light in the room, which was a concern of mine with a smaller chandelier."
4,Another good album,"Grip Inc its a great group in the trash metal scene. Well i have to say that their previous albums and especially Nemesis were much better then this one, but its also another good album. You may want to hear it sometimes before you like it as i did. I recommend this album to anyone who likes metal."
1,Poor Guidance for ITV Developers,This book makes it appear as if one can simply write Web applications that will run on Interactive Television - an egregious error. The book fails to mention a number of the major players and products in the industry. It also fails to discuss implementation details (such as headend components) and limitations of which developers must be aware (such as bandwidth restrictions).
1,"Dangerously Inaccurate, basicly incoherent","If you are a working professional in this field, much better is Interactive TV Technology & Markets by H.O. Srivastava. If you are a consumer getting your feet wet, some of the WebTV or AOL TV books are a better bet. However, if you enjoy pre-internet-crash style needless boosterism combined with a complete lack of understanding of the technologies and business models surrounding interactive television, this is probably the book for you."
1,Misleading and poor information,"This book proports to give information on how to produce for the interactive television industry. Unfortunately, the information is misguided, since most of interactive television is NOT using the tools or standards listed in the book. Additionally, some of the largest players in the Cable TV space are not even mentioned - players like Comcast, Motorola and SeaChange International.This book is a terrible dis-service for those individuals who are looking to learn about this complex industry."
1,Inaccurate Information - Misleading,"I purchased this book to gain more knowledge about the Interactive TV industry, and was greatly disappointed. After learning more about interactive television (via other channels) I was appalled by how inaccurately this book portrays the industry. Many key players are excluded across the industry and the information on what materials are necessary are missing key components. This book was a complete waste of money. I do not recommend it to anyone."
4,Mind Opening,"With little background and real interest in this topic, I picked up this book almost by whim and surprisingly found myself quickly growing more intrigued. It's written in an engaging style and provides just enough history for the novice such as myself to see the broader perspectives of this rapidly developing field. It told a ""story"" but the ending is still unfinished with the author presenting some of the more interesting possibilities. I also really enjoyed many of the ""sidebar"" interviews of the leading figures in the field. When I started I didn't think I would actually read the whole book but I did. And I glad I did."
1,Waste of Money,I'm quite disappointed in this book. It's not only missing big players in the industry (i.e. SeaChange as a VOD player which has the largest share of the market) but it also gives the wrong impression about the industry. You would think a book released this recent would realize Web thinking in the iTV industry is a major faux pas. This simply shows how little experience the author has in the iTV industry. Buying this book is a complete waste of money.
1,"started good, but....","I thought I had found the perfect pillow, but after onle 8 weeks of use, it has lost its loft and no longer supports my neck. I'm really bummed."
2,Not firm - very disappointing,"I had high hopes for this pillow. I'm a side sleeper. I like a firm pillow to avoid neck & shoulder aches, but something I can have my arm underneath as well. Despite the manufacturer's claim, this pillow is not firm at all. The first night I tried it my head sank all the way into it, like sleeping on a marshmallow. After the 2nd night I woke up in considerable pain due to lack of neck support. I never used it again. Instead I found a $9.99 pillow at Target that's firmer and more comfortable. Lesson learned - sometimes the higher price product isn't the best product. Don't waste your $$ on this if you like a firm pillow."
1,Wish I hadn't spent the money,"This pillow is supposed to stay cool, which it doesn't at all. It is also so plump that it hurts my neck to try to sleep on it. I am not using it at all and wish I had saved my money!"
4,Higher quality pillow but it still flattens out,"For the first month this was the best pillow I have ever used. It has a lot of filling, and it weighs more than cheap pillows from department stores. It has just the right amount of support for side sleeping. After 4-6 weeks it lost some of its volume and flattened a bit. It helps to puff it up in the dryer, but it never quite gets back to the original level. Overall a very good pillow, but I wish it held its loft better."
3,Ok,Not enough support but it does keep very cool and I think it will retain shape longer than normal pillow.
3,"Average Pillow, Not Worth the Price","I bought this pillow over a year ago and overall it's an OK pillow. It wasn't as puffy as I'd originally wanted but it held it's shape well and it got rid of most of the neck pain I was experiencing with cheap lumpy pillows. After roughly 6 months it began to deteriorate a bit; becoming lumpy and losing it's sturdiness and stability. At this point (almost exactly a year later) it's nearing it's end. I will seriously consider another 'Gel Fiber' pillow, however I'm going to look for one that is fluffier/puffier."
3,Going flat,"It offered a great support at first (I had a little over a month) but like any other pillow I owned is going flat, because of the size (I have king) is kind weird how your head goes down and you have two huge puffs in front and back of your head. It's ok for the price but I would not buy another one."
2,too soft for support,very squishy and soft. doesn't hold any shape for side sleepers. you'd have to hold your arm under it for support. not good for neck issues.
2,Nothing special,"I've had this pillow for about 7 months (since April 2011). The support was great for the first month, then, like every other pillow I've tried, it went flat. I don't have a melon head. I only weigh 160 lbs, and no, it's not all in my head. While I wouldn't buy another one, I don't think it was an absolute waste of time and money. It did hold out a little longer than other pillows I've tried, but it's not the answer to good side-sleeping support. Next up, I will probably try a memory foam pillow."
5,LOVE THESE PILLOWS,"I purchased these pillows several months ago and absolutely love them. For many years, I have used only down pillows but needed somthing less expensive but good quality. This does everything I need it to do and more! I am even thinking about ordering two more for my guest bedroom. I would recommend it to anyone who needs good quality pillows at a great price."
1,Waste of $$$,"I've been looking for a good night's sleep and thought this pillow would help. It did not. Save your money...this is not what you want especially if you are a side sleeper. I'm not particularly picky and only want a decent night's sleep. This pillow did not deliver. Way to soft and weak. I returned it and bought a Laura Ashely side sleeper for half the price at BBB. So far so good. Just want to share with others...not affiliated with any products, stores or establishments."
4,Best pillow I've purchased,"I am really happy with this pillow, it has the support I was looking for, and it is soft, but not mushy. I like it so much I bought another one for my husband."
3,Sleepin like a baby,I really like the pillow its different then any i have ever had !! I think the only thing i can say that i would change is i would make it a tad more firm. However i know if there isn't one made that way i would buy this one again with no doubt!!I am glad i checked amazon first.
3,"Okay, but nothing special","I am glad I got this pillow at the bargain close-out price. I got a reasonably decent pillow at a reasonably decent price. However, this pillow is nothing to get excited about. After sleeping on it overnight, I woke up to find it compressed just like any other pillow I've used. After fluffing it for a few seconds, it returned to its original shape. If you qualify for free shipping like I do, then purchasing this item is not a bad deal. But don't expect any miracles. I'm still waiting to find the pillow of my dreams."
3,It's just a pillow,"Some of Amazon's pillows, like this one, have suggested retail prices that stretch credulity. Supposedly this one retails for $79.99. It is currently selling for $39.99. If you are a regular Amazon shopper, you already know that prices can change from hour to hour. I purchased this for $14.54, which was somewhat more than it's worth, notwithstanding the claim. This is not even a down pillow; it's synthetic; I hasten to add that there is no smell. The cover is well made, and there is a fair amount of support in the pillow, i.e., it doesn't mash down. However, it's still just a $10 pillow in my estimation. The queen size is pretty close to king size; it fits into a king pillowcase with little room to spare.September 12, 2011 update: Over time, this pillow has become very very soft and lumpy besides. There never was much support with this pillow, and now there is none."
4,christmas gift for husband,he loves it soft and firm cumfy and fluffy and its hard to find a pillow he likes i bought 2
3,Pretty good,"I am still on my search for pillows like the ones I used to sleep on when I was younger. But I can't find them. This one is filled very nicely and stays thick even when you put your head on it and the pillow does not fluff up and cover your ears when you lay on your back which is a good thing.But the pillow still hurts my ear and makes it feel stuffed when I sleep on my side. The only pillow that does not hurt my ear is Mediflow Original Waterbase Pillow. But it gives me strange dreams.I am still on the lookout for a pillow I slept in at a Best Western Hotel.Here is the info on it:Dacron DreamMakerMade for Best Western byNational Sleep Products1964 4th Avenue SouthSeattle, WA 98134UPC: 0 25521 13187 3When I contacted 'National Sleep Products' AKA 'Pacific Coast' they never got back to me. If anyone knows where I can purchase this pillow please let me know."
4,Gel Fiber Pillow,I really like this pillow. At first it was a little high but after laying on it a few nights it settled down. The gel fiber is movable so if I want more support under my neck I can push more pillow there. It is kind of heavy yet very soft and I think very reasonably priced because I have gotten therapuetic pillows that are just a comfortable but cost more.
4,Happy customer,I am happy with the product that I have received. When looking to make the purchase I didn't like the fact that you didn't know what fibers had be used to make this pillow. As it turns out it was a polyester filling. Even with this fiber I would recommend this pillow to anyone that sleeps on their side.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this Pillow a few months ago and was so excited by the reviews, thinking, Finally I found a pillow that doesn't cost a ridiculous amount of money! I was disappointed night after night. I actually wake up with more neck stiffness than before and pain on the side of my face I sleep on. I would not recommend this product."
2,Not good for side sleepers,"The only reason I am giving this two stars is because I gave this pillow to someone who sleeps on their back and they loved it.For me, though, this pillow is just way too big! I sleep on my side with an arm under my head. I just cannot sleep any other way without major pains in my shoulders and back. Because of this, it just makes the pillow come up way higher than I need. My head is actually tilted upward with this pillow, which makes it very uncomfortable to sleep. I tried this pillow for two nights, I really did. But I just couldn't stand it anymore and went back to my previous pillow.- A ModernMom.com Insider"
5,Pillow,Great firm gel pillow. I used to buy the Wamsutta gel from Linens n Things and have tried to find a replacement. I found the Wamsutta brand at Macy's but the pillow wasn't the same - not firm enough and didn't have the same shape - squared sides. This one is perfect. Of course I paid one third of the suggested retail making it a good value as well.
5,A Great Nights Sleep,"I read a review in a health magazine for this pillow. It is true to it's word. Great price on a great night's sleep. The word ""gel"" was not in the magazine review so upon arrival I was skeptical of what this side sleeper pillow would be like. It is great, with a fist to the center it will shape whatever space it needs to fill, Along with free shipping and no tax this is a good buy."
1,WORSE NECK PAIN EVER,"I bought this pillow after reading the great reviews but regretted it the first night. I laid on it for about 10 minutes and felt some discomfort in my neck and shoulder. I moved around and tried to adjust myself. About 10 minutes later, I was in excruciating pain. I had to run Bengay on and switch back to my old pillow. Its been three days and I'm still having to rub Bengay on myself. Never have I used such an uncomfortable pillow. AVOID IT! Just hope Amazon will let me return it without paying shipping costs."
1,TERRIBLE SOFT PILLOW,"If you are looking for a VERY SOFT pillow, you'll love this one. I was looking for a true side sleeper pillow (which should be firm) this is soooooooo not it. I called to return it the second I opened the box...that's how awful it was."
3,Good but expensive,The product is fairly good but very expensive compared to the memory foam pillows that Costco sells
4,side sleeper pillow review,"I purchased this pillow for my husband because he sleeps on his side, and I decided to get a specific pillow. He loves the pillow. He was sleeping with 3 pillows and is now using just this one, and is very happy."
3,It is just a pillow,I keep hoping for the perfect pillow that will last. I don't think it exists. I have tried just about everything and I don't think any thing holds up for long. It is just OK. Don't expect too much.
1,Bootleg copy?,"If this is that awful copy from China, Amazon shouldn't be offering this at all. It's too dark to appreciate the color. It's probably a bootlegged copy and breaks copyright law. Do yourself a favor and get a legal copy from Warner which is now available."
5,An Ancient Masterpiece,I originally saw this movie in 1950 and it has always been one of my favorite. I had the opportunity to record it at one time but my copy has been destroyed. It is an oldfashioned good vs evil. The acting is great and Burt Lancaster was a new star at the time along with his sidekick Jacques Tourneur.
3,alot of action,another movie my mom melane wanted because it was a film also burt lancaster and my nephew malachi liked it too.still another movie before my time
3,The Flame and theArrow,"I remember this fondly from my childhood but it was a mild disappointment this time around. Nothing wrong with Burt Lancaster, mind you, he's in fine acting form. This is just an entertainment piece of fluff not meant to be more than that. Lancaster & Cravat do pull off some incredible stunts which shows off their circus background. Virginia Mayo is lovely but almost anyone could've played the female lead. Hollywood has done better versions of swashbuckling than this, but not with any other actor gifted as Lancaster, athletically. This is an average movie lifted a hair above by Lancaster. The quality is excellent with a Joe McDoakes short & a Beaky Buzzard cartoon that are restored also. So get some popcorn & have a Saturday matinee."
3,Interesting but stale at times,"Pleasing adventure film is beautifully photographed with Lancaster swashbuckling his way through. The action sequences are credible, yet too familiar as is the plot."
1,"Excuse me, what movie were you watching?","In the one I saw, our noble hero captures the woman and keeps her chained by the neck to a tree while he lectures her about freedom, in one of the most repulsively sexist movies I have ever seen. It is mostly useful in showing people the really horrifying images that were routinely shown to children during the clean and conventional 1950s. Today we would call it bondage porn and keep it for really weird adults only."
4,Great Product!,"I bought this product in the past from a Dept. Store (that has decided not to carry this product any longer), and have always been pleased with it. The locking vault is very versatile, and is constructed very well. I am very hard on my products, and this one definitely can withstand a LOT of damage. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Don't purchase it for the ""locking"" mechanism however (which is why the 4 stars only), as mentioned by others, it is very flimsy and cheap like used on a diary. If you don't need to particularly make it ""secure""... you will LOVE it!"
3,A half size too big,"I normally wear a 6 1/2, but these shoes feel like a size 7 or even a 7 1/2. Other than the size difference, these shoes seem pretty comfortable."
5,So easy to use,"Being that the price was so reasonable, and because I'm always making mistakes with my eye makeup, I decided to take a chance on Revlon's New Makeup Eraser. Am I glad I did! It works perfectly, deleting any smudges or mistakes I make due to my poor eyesight. And how fabulous to have one for my vanity and one for my purse! This product is definitely a keeper and one I'll be buying for quite a while.Revlon New Makeup Eraser Pen (2 Pack)"
1,buyer beware,"I usually mess up my eye makeup so when I saw this I figured it was the answer to my prayers. I was happy with the low price and the brand name seemed trustworthy enough. As soon as I used it a little below my eyelid, I felt a hot burning sensation. Not just ""Ouch, that stings a little"" but a ""HOLY !@#$%^ MY SKIN IS ON FIRE!"" I got the feeling if I didn't immediately wipe the area with water, it was going to do something terrible. Granted, I do have sensitive skin. I guess harsh chemicals is the trade-off for immediate makeup removal but if I have to experience pain and wipe it with water anyway, doesn't that defeat the purpose?If you have sensitive skin, stay away from this product!!"
4,love it,well i got this a cupple weeks ago and now i wonder how i lived without it. i do makeup for my friends weddings and last week for my neice for homecomeing and its hard when your doing others makeup because they tend to move but this product allowed me to fix all mistakes without haveing to start over it saved my bacon LOL buy it you'll love it too
1,This pen is a makeup mistake!,"It's awful. I tried it on eyeliner, lipliner and lipstick and even on various colors because I was so shocked at how this not only did not work but made things look even worse. The only thing this pen removed was money from my wallet."
5,Excellent Biography and Environmental Treatise,"I've often been fascinated by John Muir, ever since I started visiting many different national parks out west and seeing his name cited everywhere as an inspiration. If you are interested in environmental ethics and theory (as opposed to simplistic tree-hugging and other poorly-considered theories), and if you have a primal love for the outdoors, then John Muir is your man. Here Frederick Turner has written a solid biography of the man, with all the research and articulation that should be expected. Turner also includes a large dose of Muir's opinions and theories, as well as the historical and political background behind Muir's actions and thought processes. Therefore, what we have here is not just an informative biography on the public person, but an enlightening treatise on environmental ethics and theory, as defined by the brilliant mind of Muir himself."
1,2012 An Awakening -,I was very disappointed in the material of An Awakening. It seemed to be indivual plugs for other dvds or material of featured guest/authors. It was very misleading and I would not recommend it to anyone.
3,Thinkers Weigh In,"Celebrities are gods, money is worshipped, Mayans predicted that 2012 will be the End of Days...What does it all mean? A host of new age thinkers weigh in on the theories of 2012."
1,"There is no Movie, just previews of movies/documentaries","Did I miss something??? There are about 8 previews of documentaries on this DVD. I did not see or could find a documentary on 2012, nor did I see a preview on anything that is related to 2012 or the Mayans. I ran it twice and if this is all that I get for my money, I want my money back.Who buys a movie with only previews on it? I didn't buy this so I can watch a (8) 2-4 minute clips of other movies !!I am shocked.Where's the movie???"
3,Are We Doomed To Perish?,"Now that 2012 is fast-approaching, everyone is talking about and worrying about the Earth and our very lives. Are humans doomed to die out just like the dinosaurs? Can we save ourselves and the planet? Several experts and best selling authors are interviewed for this film and they offer their own perspective on global warming, solar flares, the politics of environmental issues, earth science, and more.So, are we going to die out or not?I seriously doubt it since we can look back on various periods of history and see that philosophers have always talked about the end of times. But, one thing is for certain, we're in for some changes and probably big changes at that. In fact, we can see that the world and our lives have been shifting more and more as the years pass, and it may all reach a pinnacle on 12/12/12. Whether you believe everything these philosophers have to say or not, this DVD certainly makes you think and we need more films like this."
4,extra peace of mind while travelling,"My husband and I ordered several of these locks for a recent trip to Italy. We put them on our carry-on luggage and day packs. Especially while site-seeing, it gave us extra peace of mind not having to constantly think about the day packs on our backs. The neon colors told potential thieves to look elsewhere for an easier target. Note that it is important to verify the the numbers are still correctly aligned for your combination before re-locking the locks. If the numbers have shifted and you force the lock to close, you may damage the lock. Otherwise, we felt these locks were pretty hardy and a good value."
3,TSA Luggage Locks,"The instructions on setting the codes were confusing and I ordered 2 in purple but received one in pink and one in orange. Someone on one of the locks, I managed to change the lock to something unknown and now it is useless."
3,Cute - if they work!,"I got the locks - I was disappointed I didn't get to choose the color, but I was sent pink ones, which was fine. However, only one of them worked! Despite what seemed like fairly clear instructions on how to set the combination, only one of them actually works with the combination I set. The other one won't lock at all! I leave tomorrow for Australia, and have two suitcases, and am disappointed that I am now going to have to run out and buy another lock, as I don't have the time to order a replacement for these."
2,Lost in Transit :(,"The hole that the lock latch is supposed to squish into isn't deep enough. It also requires holding it in place while messing up the combination in order to be secure - mostly because it won't hold just by pushing down. I went to England with a checked bag needing two locks. After three flights, I found that one of my locks was sort of stuck due to one of the personnel doing it almost right. I managed to get it open. After locking my bag seven more times over the next month as I moved around, all seemed fine. However, after three flights back home, my bag arrived at the final airport without one of the locks, presumably having been locked after not being properly secured.I would not buy these locks again. For the cost, I expect them to perform much better than making it through three airports twice. I wish I could get half my money back since, due to its design, I know have only one of the two locks."
2,One for Two - DOA,"Ordered the lock set. Attempted to change the lock combination on both from the default of ""000"". The first went OK with multiple tries, following the directions. The second one never accepted the change, tried multiple times and is now non-functional. The shackle shaft now is free to come out of the lock body; internal manufacture seems cheap. Will ask for a replacement under lifetime warranty but at 2-4 week delivery being after we leave on a trip - good luck with that. Will look elsewhere for a better lock - you probably should too."
2,Cheap locks: be careful when setting the code!,"I expected these to be a little flimsy when I bought them, so I cannot say I was disappointed. I needed three locks and got two sets, what was important: I didn't pay much attention to other reviews that mentioned they had problems setting the code and endend up losing the first one. I was not very careful with the dials and it got into a condition where I could not make it work. With the other three, I was more careful with the procedure, and now they work ok. If you do that, you'll probably be ok. But do not expect extra-sturdy locks, for their price!"
3,"Master Lock 4684T TSA-Accepted Lock in Neon Green, Orange, Pink, or Purple, 2-Pack","Good afternoon I want to know if they have pink locks, because when I try to make the purchase I get the image of green and pink like a game and one Green.I await your prompt responseThanks ...."
3,"Stayed locked, but plastic cracked with first use!","I was sad to see that the plastic part had been smashed during transport the very first time we used the lock, but the lock did stay on and still works! I would purchase a metal one next time though."
3,A little larger than expected,"These locks were a little bit larger than I expected when I ordered them. Instead of being the traditional inch size, they are about two inches by an inch and a half- noticeably larger than some other Master Lock TSA travel locks. Since they are bigger they are also a bit heavier which can add additional weight to your luggage. However, these locks are made mostly of plastic so they are not as heavy as some other brands. The lime green color also makes your bags easily identifiable especially if you have the standard black luggage. These are fairly tough locks and haven't given me any problems when traveling. But do note their larger size and weight."
1,Poor quality,"I bought 4 locks and the combos on two were unsettable. We followed the directions step by step, but only worked on half of them. Waste of money. 1 star is too many."
2,Product Defect,This product works well - one of the 2 locks. The 2nd one does not work at all as the punger cannot be re-inserted into the lock.
3,DID NOT COME IN NEON COLOR AS ADVERTISED,"I had read the previous reviews that mentioned getting metallic colored locks instead of the neon colors advertised. I felt that, since those reviews were a few months old, that a company with as good a reputation as Amazon would have solved the issue by now. WRONG! The product info specifically states the locks are neon colors for easier bag identification, and lists the possible colors. Was silver one of the listed colors? No. Did I get silver locks? Yes. They work fine, but one of the reasons I chose them was for the bright colors, just as advertised!I am keeping the locks because I need them right away for holiday travel, but I am VERY disappointed in Amazon for not at least updating the item description to state you may get plain metal colored locks."
2,"Wrong color for me too, add should include nickle as a choice","The first order was sent in an envelope and fell out during delivery, so I got an empty package. Second order came but was not neon, but nickel. Very heavy. Called customer service and they authorized a free return. The model number is the same as for the neons, so I suspect that MasterLock has replaced the neon with the nickel.I am also sending them back because I wanted something more visible."
3,"50/50 chance, so buy extra","Bought 2 sets, so 4 locks in total. Have only been able to use 2. One had a deformed plastic casing so I was unable to change the lock code. A second, also deformed, came undone while changing the code, now I have no idea what the code is. The other two work perfectly. Seems to be hit to miss. They are inexpensive so buy extra."
1,very bad,"Of the 2 Locks only one worked. I put the combination to the first one and was ok , the second one broke while i was doing the setting of the combination so i pay 14 $ for just one as the other broke"
2,I agree with S. Greenwood,"I asked for a green lock and a silver one came. I wanted a bright lock that would be easy to identify. The silver lock that came does not even look like the image that was posted and it is heavy which is a concern for long hauls. I went back and re-read the fine print and to be fair, it does say that you are not allowed to pick a color. But, at the top of the page, it allows you to click on a color so it is a little misleading."
3,shipped item was not the advertised color,i received silver padlocks instead of the advertised neon colors. amazon indicated that there is no guarantee on the color of padlocks shipped but silver was not included in the advertised neon colors available.i should have purchased these items from another seller since i need the colors to identify my bags from others.
1,Cheap Locks one broke while resetting,I got one reset to a new number but the other one broke while I was resetting it. Returned them both as I don't want to be overseas with these things. One would think Master locks would be better.
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered lime green locks and received PINK! I don't want pink locks on my luggage. Plus, I was able to set the combination on one of the locks and not on the other. I've ordered TSA locks from Packsafe in the hope that the quality and service is better."
1,Not the great locks I used to buy,"These locks used to be nice robust metal locks but are now mostly plastic. I bought four of them because I had liked my old Master TSA combination locks a lot, but found these very disappointing. The mechanisms stick and I wasn't ever able to set combinations on three of the four locks. I will not buy these again and strongly recommend against them."
1,Needs quality check!,"I have bought two sets of these luggage locks, and I have been disappointed both times. I'm very good with following directions, but like many other reviewers, the locks died on me in the process of setting a combination. In my first pack, one died and one lived. In my second pack, both died....you would think that after I did one right on my first pack, the two from my second pack would be a piece of cake. Nope. If you read other reviews, you'll know it's not just me. These locks need a quality check because 3/4 of mine were defective. Don't get fooled by the pretty colors because that's as good as it will get. For the one remaining lock I have that ""works,"" I'm throwing it out because the last thing I want is for it to get stuck when I'm trying to open my luggage. I'm sticking with my Brinks 22mm TSA Keyed Brass Lock, 4pk (from WalMart), which hasn't done me wrong for the past 5 years of use."
3,Color Choice?,"The lock works, for now anyway.I really wanted the orange locks but couldn't spot any menu on picking the color you liked. They shipped me purple locks which is okay since my girlfriend likes purple -- But I really wanted that orange color! I'm hesitant to try purchasing again, since the odds are 25% that I will get my choice. If you need a lock and don't care about what color they ship to you, this is your item! I cannot stress the importance of combination locks over keyed locks...it's one less thing (where did I leave the key?) you'll have to worry about when traveling!"
1,Piece of Garbage,"I took this out of the package and the first thing I noticed is that the shackle is so thin that it would be really easy for a thief to cut it. Granted it's fake protection in the first place, especially in light of the number of arrests of TSA agents involved with theft from travellers' suitcases, but that's not the point. I assumed that a Master padlock would provise a certain level of security, but this lock doesn't meet that standard.I followed the directions to set the combination. It didn't work. Little bits of plastic got gouged out in the process. This piece of complete junk is going back.For the people who are upset because they specified a particular color and got another color, it says in the listing that you don't get to choose the color."
3,works but sent wrong color,"Showed green, sent pink, no option to choose color. Seems they send you whatever color they want. Work as advertised, however not opened yet by TSA at airport yet"
3,good ones - bad ones,"I bought these and received 2 sets (4) pink ones. The were sturdy, easy to reset combination. I was totally satisfied with the locks. Then I refered a tour group to use them. My ears have burned with complaints about the purple ones. So, I ordered another set and got a pair of purple ones. The long and short is one wroks and one doesn't............there were different instructions to reset combination for each color, I don't know if this really had anything to do with it or, but the first lock I tried to reset (purple) did not work, has not worked, andprobably will never work. The second one (purple) opened to the instructions that came with the pink locks. Go figure.................to get your money back is a pain. If I knew I would get pink I would reorder, but there is no guarantee therefore, I will eat the purple ones and not recommend for my tour groups. The only ones I have come in contact with are the pink and purple."
3,"Not so bad, but some are not good...","I purchased 8 pairs of these locks.. And 3 of them don't work at all... Unfortunately, I live over seas and returning the items will be a hastle for me. I recommend you read the instructions cafefully before trying to manipulate them... They are very sensitive... I hope I could replace these 3... Maybe what I saved in buying these locks was lost with one and a half pair I paid for...Also, I never received the color green. All of them were purple, pink and orange..."
1,"Non-working, though new out of plastic shipping material","Neither locks work. In order to send it back I will have to be inconvenienced, pay postage (even though defective) as well as shipping back. My trip is two weeks away so this is a big burden at this juncture."
1,Weak!,"I should know by now that these stupid little TSA approved combo locks are lame. It's great that you can program your own code, but not if it doesn't hold it properly. If I try to get a lock again, I'll go with one with a key.But here is a suggestion. Instead of locking your bags (as if this toy gadget would really keep out anyone who wanted to get it), just secure them with a zip tie. That accomplishes my real goal... to keep my unmentionables in my bag and off the baggage carousel."
1,Unreliable combination lock,"I ordered two sets of combination locks, and only one in each package is usable. One of the shackles arrived jammed, and don't go all the way down to actually lock the device. The other lock, the combination we selected did not work, and the lock won't open. The reset code also does not work. Because of these problems, I am concerned about using the two locks that actually work as I am afraid they will jam or break while I am on vacation. The bodies of the locks are made out of plastic and they look quite cheap, and the shackle seems to damage the plastic every time it is turned.I love the bright neon color (received a pink and a purple set) and the size of the locks, but I will probably contact Amazon to return them, and order a better set."
3,Order Problem,"OK..Just ordered these locks. So what color do you get? There is NO option to choose green, orange, pink, or purple. Also no contact information or comment section in the checkout. Could be better for this item...Hope I get Neon Green that's what I wanted!"
1,lock cut off,"Traveled from NYC to Greece and upon arrival locks had been cut off luggage. Unknown what airport clipped the locks, but no guarantee airport personnel treat TSA locks any differently from regular. Big waste of money for me."
5,master lock accepted lock for airplort,I bought these to lock up a bagage that I took a weapon on board a plane with ammo in another bag they both had to be secured with these locks so that they could be inspected as we flew to another state. The weapons arrived safly as the plane did and all went well at the airport with the special locks that i had to use great purchase .
1,expensive fishing line sinkers,"Bought a set of two Master Locks. After spending 15 minutes on both locks trying to set the code gave up.The locking mecahanism is cheap and cumbersome. Will try sending them back. If that fails, I'll putthem in the fishing tackle box and use them as weights."
1,Don't buy!,I bought 10 of these and only 4 actually worked! The 6 that didn't work wouldn't lock at all. Don't buy these unless it's an absolute last resort. There are far better locks on the market.
1,Be Aware,"Master Lock Luggage Lock, Neon Green, Orange, Pink, or Purple, 2-Pack #4684TI ordered these locks because I wanted a colorful lock to make my luggage easier to find.What was delivered were 2 Silver locks. Silver is NOT one of the colors mentioned in the ad. Silver locks were exactly what I did not want! I sent them back."
2,Not as advertised !!,I ordered these locks and received silver Master Locks which did not look like the ones advertised. I had ordered specifically for the brighter colors to help spot our luggage on the carousel.
3,"Light Weight ""Security"" Locks","These are nice colorful locks---mine came in pink. I do not see anyway to select the color of your choice on the web site. They are not actually security locks, as it is very easy to burst open the plastic locks. They are mainly for looks in my opinion, and will more than likely deter the honest person from tampering with your luggage however I doubt they will deter the thief from opening your luggage. These are TSA approved and easy to reset the combination for your own desire numbers. I would not pull and tug on the mechanism too harshly as they could break. If you want real security locks that could withstand some hard abuse I would recommend upgrading to a better lock. These are made by MASTER and MASTER has some much better locks for not a lot more money. These will serve the purpose for the time being however if I was traveling a lot on the plane, I would upgrade to a heavier duty TSA approved lock."
2,Not so great,"I bought this book and the Rough Guide to Cyprus for my year long stay in Cyprus. Get the Rough Guide. This book is far less informative and is quite out of date. For instance, despite the fact that the edition I bought was ""updated"" in something like 1997, it still lists the US Embassy at an address that has been defunct for about 10 years. Pretty basic item for a travel book to have straight. The book is readable but unless you're looking for a very quick intro to Cyprus, get the Rough Guide instead."
1,Waste of money,"I got so bored in the first 5 minutes. Waste of money. Doesn't even cover the highlights. I've been to Oregon, but if I seen this video first, I probably wouldn't have gone."
5,A very good and rare Everly record,"This is a very rare and good Everly CD; buy it while you can !The style is not country, it's a rocking one it's also quite unique (no other Everly record has such a sound) It was NOT recorded in USA but in UK during the musical Bristish ""invasion"" (early sixties).The Everlys had deeply inspired the Beatles and, at this period of time, the beatles had inspired the Everlys in return.It includes one master piece sung by Don only ""The collector"" but almost all tracks are very good anyway !Rush ! Thierry Cordonnier from France."
5,Everly Brothers Sing Hollies,"Great album! Eight of the twelve songs are Hollies covers, which is pretty great since I love both The Hollies and The Everly Brothers. The Hollies covers include ""So Lonely"", ""Signs That Will Never Change"", ""Like Everytime Before"", ""I've Been Wrong Before"", ""Have You Ever Loved Somebody"", ""Don't Run And Hide"", ""Fifi The Flea"", and ""Hard Hard Year"". This album also has a Manfred Mann cover, ""Pretty Flamingo"". This is a fantastic album that The Everly Brothers did in the UK. They made the songs different from the originals with their unique voices and though it's not really The Everly Brothers' ""style"", it's still a wonderful album to own."
3,"Great performances, poor material","Great harmonies, great musicians, poor songs, specially (very) poor lyrics.I've given it about four chances and only half of the songs have some merits. Nevertheless Pretty Flamingo (I think) it's a real gem.Now, when we look back to the sixties, we can see that The Beatles were so much greater than the others, and I mean The Hollies in this occassion because theirs is most of the material the Everlys offered in this album.Anyway, nothing to match neither to be compared with the Everlys hail day back in the fifties."
4,For Mac users - this Edition is Not the Version for the Mac,"Amazon made a mistake and put down that this version is for the Macintosh OS X operating system in addition to Windows. That is not the case. Activision does not release games on the MAC platform. They work with other, third party companies to do so. Aspyr is the company that makes Call of Duty on the Mac. Search for games by Aspyr and you'll find it there.Just an FYI so Mac users don't buy the wrong game."
3,Call of Duty Review for U,"A high powered PC with a superior graphics card with at least 256K onboard is essential for seamless gameplay and superior graphics. The story is somewhat laborious when the player's role is in the Russian Army even with it's humerous dialogue. When American, the story line follows familiar historical events. All in all, Call of Duty offers good graphics and rich content worthy of it's reduced price."
1,A Game for OLD Computers ONLY,I was very disappointed with this game because I can not play it on my to new computer (1 year old) it seemes that Activision has not updated it which means I have to search for the correct older Drivers to play which is strange since Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty World at War both work fine on my system. So if you want this game you better have a OLD system to play it on.
1,if the prodect code is missing,"I went to load the program, it asks for the product code in the white box on the back of the case...there is none, nor on the box, or anywhere. There is a list of codes on the instruction book however those are the wrong codes. So check before you buy or open."
4,Good Game,I played the first call of duty..and purchased this based on my experience with the first one. Just started the game and so afr I like it. Will update as I progress through the rest of the game.So far am impressed.
3,First Call of Duty,I bought this game because I liked it so much when it first came out. I enjoy it still but the multiplayer games are not as abundant as they once were. I noticed with a much improved PC the game has more to offer and see. My first PC was limited in Graphics and memory. I did not see water in the Prison Camp pond before.
1,SWEEEEET AAAACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game ROCKS OUT LOUD!!! i played the demo and i was drawn into its sweeet aaaaction. the graphics ROCK OUT LOUD!!!!! hecka nice!!!!!!!!! ohh yea baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oooooooooo!!!!!!! man no one could ever beat this game baby cuz it mega rocks out loud. (this game sucks)
3,"Talk about ""Not getting the joke"", Sheesh!","Iy's not a game. It's a (Foul mouthed) jab in th eye of role playing geeks.It's aimed at I can't get laid D&D; nerd, those depressing wanna be goth-vampire dorks, and every other RPG geek and their hobby.I am amazed that some actually play it...."
1,CRASSSHHH!,"Pinnacle is notorious for one thing, and one thing only: crashing your system.The only video editing software more unreliable than Pinnacle is Windows Movie Maker.If you like having hours of work disappear altogether, simply because you moved your mouse too fast, or didn't wait for that hourglass icon to go away before choosing your next action, then buy away.But if you actually want to do something productive with a video authoring suite, then look elsewhere. Pinnacle is not for you."
3,Cute little Peace Beanie Baby,"One Christmas I did a ""Peace"" themed gift package for my early teen granddaughters, and topped off the packages with Peace Beanie Babies. They are what they are, little stuffed animals. Collectable I guess, but that isn't why I bought them. They looked well made and looked adorable on top of their gifts."
5,I'm not here to argue over the Tiki-Moai distinction,"But rather I am here to praise the blue swizzle sticks of Accoutrements. For they are blue like no other and they swizzle up a storm. Strong enough for a Blue Hawaiian, yet delicate enough for the aqua-toned Misty Rum Forest, and daring enough to dive, un-color coordinated, headlong into a Mai Tai. One evening, with nothing better to do, I used one to mix and decorate my mojito. Of such experiences one becomes accustomed when you own accoutrements of tiki stirring."
4,Better remastering of a great recording,"The remastering of Karajan's 1947 conducting of Beethoven's Ninth has improved the sound. Much has been said about this recording (see the notes by the Santa Fe Listener and also mine). What I suggest is that - if you are new to historical recordings - you download one of the tracks, listen to it carefully, and if you like it buy the cd. The MP3 doesn't always do justice to these recordings because it compresses considerably, and lower the sound quality. This is an excellent reading of the Ninth by Karajan. There is also another one now available on ORFEO with the Vienna Philharmonic but the sound quality is not very good."
2,Save your money,"This is just a terrible recording. The performance would be ok, but the quality of the audio is awful. Save your money and get the much better performance of the 9th by Von Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic. Not only is the performance better, the recording itself won't leave you feeling like you're sitting in the balcony in a barrel."
4,Great!,"Three arrived in the mail last night. Love them so much that I ordered 4 more.Fila Women's Prato SkirtNavy color makes this piece easy to incorporate.Pleats are well-proportioned to the rest of the skirt.Built-in, matching shorts underneath.Discreet logo.Material is a tad scratchy, but should be easy to care for & wash.Zipper catches on the horizontal seam, but there are no buttons to lose."
1,Not what is advertised!,"I would like to review this item, but I have never received it!What I received, instead of being 36"" x 72"", was 16"" x 16"" -- not what is advertised! I returned that shipment and asked for a refund, unless the correct item was truly available; in that case, ship it!The replacement was a duplicate of the first, incorrect item. I requested a second return, but was told the correct table was being shipped; it has not arrived.I am skeptical that a third try will produce the correct item -- I suspect the table listed on the website does not exist; or else it is mislabled, and may never be found. If it does exist, you will be reading a review of the 36"" x 72"" table, rather than a complaint about careless shipping practices!"
4,Book interesting,"While the book made for interesting reading (I have a 15 month son), I did not like how inflexible it came across. For example, it would say at 8 months, your baby should be doing this...If my child weren't doing whatever it was at that exact time, and I didn't know better, the book would have scared the crap out of me, making me think something was horribly wrong with my child. Now I have not read the entire book, as I am reading it as my child grows up."
3,"Your Child; Emotional, Behavioral & Cognitive Devel","this is a great resource especially if your children are entering or have entered the ""twilight Zone"" of preadolescence"
2,Inadequate,"Like so many other realms, this book lumps children who are not babies or toddlers into a huge group that includes preteens. If you have a baby, fine. Otherwise, find another more focused book for your 6 to 12 year old.Sorry I wasted my money. I am often left unanswered."
5,"A ""must have"" for every parent","""Your Child"" truly is an essential for every home. Although written by members of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, it's parent friendly to read!Age groups are broken down in each chapter, which I found helpful to find and very easy to use for my family.The information I obtained and utilized was priceless. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great show!!,"I hadn't planned on watching this show when it first came on tv. I'd seen the previews for it, but thought, ""Naaah"". My husband had taken a day off and was flipping through channels when he ran up on a Leverage marathon. He watched one and was hooked. Of course, he made me watch one when I got home and I was hooked too!! It's terrific!! The characters are great and the actors are so well-matched and interact so well and their chemistry is great. We hadn't seen the show from the beginning which is why I had to buy the whole first season. This show is like a bag of chips -- you can't watch just one!!!"
5,finally a series worth watching,"Love the show and the concept of the show, love how well the characters blend, it is a great series and hope it lasts more than five seasons."
2,Bad Decision in Disc Creation,"It's an excellent show, visually the DVDs are great, but not having subtitles lowers my rating from 4 stars to 2."
5,One of the Finest Shows that I have ever Seen,"When I first heard about this show, I thought ""Oh, Great! A retelling of Robin Hood! Just what we need!"" Needless to say, I did not plan on watching it - despite my love of Timothy Hutton. My parents watched it though, and gave it rave reviews - fortunately. Finally, they persuaded my to watch that week's episode with them, ""The Miracle Job."" Instant love. I finally had to take the - for me - unprecedented step of buying a tv pass for this show. Is it a modern retelling of Robin Hood? Yes, I suppose so, but it is so cute and so much fun that it is worth it! The cast is amazing, and hilarious. Another big plus is that it is incredibly clean. There has, so far at least, been very little sexual content and almost no gore. Tuesday is the high point of my tv week thanks to this show. It is absolutely fantastic!"
5,weekly drama,i love this show but have a hard time locating it here on regular tv in my area. was thrilled to find that amazon had it for sale for my kindle. great service and am thrilled i now can watch it whenever i want!! thanks soo much!!
4,Ocean's 11 in an hour,"I see I'm not the first review to find this show similar to Ocean's 11. It has a lot of the same pleasures: attractive, quirky protagonists, great, elaborate scams (some of which are revealed and some concealed from the viewer until the end), and a great deal of humor. Much of the humor comes from the characters' interactions: this is a team of folks who are used to working alone. While some shows are more inventive and compelling than others, they are pretty uniformly engaging. Leverage is an easy addiction: a dependable good time."
5,My favorite show,"This is the pilot episode for a great series. This is my favorite show, as well as my husband and teenage daughter's favorite show. This is a don't miss episode!"
2,"Good plots, terrible casting","I love good caper shows, but the casting is almost a total disaster. Timothy Hutton, the black guy and the blond girl are not terribly engaging, likeable or compelling. The black guy, in particular, is utterly unconvincing as the stereotypical black computer superwhiz, and utterly annoying and bland otherwise, sleepwalking through the series. Timothy Hutton has a grandma vibe. But the tough guy is a good pick.I realize dissenting reviews of TV series are the kiss of death for a reviewer, but I have to be honest."
5,LEVERAGE THE FIRST SEASON,THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM WITH A LOT OF ACTION! IT KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH THE SEASON! IT HAS A LOT OF SUSPENSE AND THE WHOLE TIME YOU ARE WONDERING HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PULL IT OFF. I REALLY ENJOYED THESE DVD'S AND AM LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE SECOND SEASON TO COME OUT! YOU CAN NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU LIKE ACTION AND IT HAS SO MANY CURVES AND TURNS YOUR JUST NOT SURE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE UNTIL OF COURSE THEY COME THROUGH AGAIN!! DON'T MISS THIS OPPERTUNITY TO WATCH ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TV AND DVD!!
5,leverage,Our family really enjoys this series. If you have not seen it I would highly recommend watching it. The cast mess really well together
4,"viewer review of ""LEVERAGE"" Season 1","I saw one episode of ""Leverage"" season 1 on a TV rerun and immediately knew I had to have it. It was every bit as good as I'd hoped. Great plot, fast moving action, wonderful character definition. I am eagerly awating delivery of Season 2 right now. I haven't enjoyed a series this much since Buffy and Angel...."
5,Leverage: The First Season,Leverage: The First Season is just fantastic and I can't wait for the DVD of the second season to be available!
5,Awesome,Great fight scenes Elliot spencer kicks some serious ass pretty much the best part of the show for me awesome scams great actors all around awesome show
4,"slick cons, comedic relief - not bad for TV","Leverage is entertaining and has pretty decent plots, for TV. The characters are likable and the cons are fun to watch unfold. Kinda wish they wouldn't have wrote the Nate character with a drinking problem, though - it would have worked just as well or better without that ""downer"" of a twist."
3,Leverage: The First Season,"Although I've always liked Timmothy Hutton's acting abilities, I'd have to say in this series, his character is flat. In the whole first season, it seems like the actors aren't really that interested in playing their parts to the full extent of their talents. As a drunk, Tim Hutton seems to drag the show down because he is the leader of the group and impacts all the characters, so perhaps he is playing his role perfectly?!?Maybe next season, the characters will show more life. Although I can't recommend that you spend your money on ""Leverage,"" I recommend renting it first (or watching some of it on the Amazon Movie program if it is available), and then deciding if you'd like to buy Season 2."
4,Love Leverage,"I'm a great fan of Timothy Hutton. This series was one of my favorites, I am sorry that it was cancelled."
2,Not Closed Captioned???,Amazon sometimes does a pretty poor job of letting us know that the DVDs they sell are not captioned. I found that to be the case with this one. The original shows were captioned but for some reason the distributer chose to release the DVD without that capability. Since I had to try and play them in order to find that out they are not returnable. So I guess they will spend time collecting dust on my shelf until I can find someone to give them to.
5,Why had I never heard of this show?,"Seriously - I ran across it by accident...and then ended up watching 6 episodes in one day. It's so similar to Ocean's 11 (although with slightly less pretty people) - even the music seems the same. And the Robin Hood element is great - it allows the viewer to root for the crooks.As long as you can suspend your disbelief - and ignore the slight choppiness of the episode continuity (Nate's an alcoholic, no he's fine, no he's an alcoholic!) - this is a crazily addictive show. If you liked either Ocean's 11 or Sneakers - you'll like this show. Now I shall watch another one!"
1,Mixed bag,"This book has a wide range of topics.1. scientific explanations for mate choice (very good)2. sociology studies explaining human mate choice (good)3. historical anecdotes (dubious)4. feminist rants (disgusting)5. unsubstantiated accusations (harmful)I would not recommend this book to anyone, Batten should have stuck with the science."
2,nice lamp but color wrong,"color not as appears in photo. actual color is a dull gray-pink. other than the color, the lamp it nice."
5,the most thorough work in print on rabbit behavior,"This is a study of the behavior of the domestic rabbit and its ancestor, the European wild rabbit. It has answers to almost all the questions you will ever have about why your rabbit acts the way it does. The author puts problem behaviors like biting in perspective, explaining the natural impulses behind them and providing ways to guide your rabbit out of them. Because our domestic rabbits have been bred mainly for appearance rather than for behavioral traits, they are still very close to their wild brethren in their behavioral habits. Thus, the author spends quite a bit of time exploring how rabbits live in the wild, and then shows how these behaviors carry forward into the domestic situation. This is a valuable work, as it is currently difficult to find information in print on wild rabbit behavior."
5,A must read for anyone with rabbits.,"This is the most comprehensive easy-to-read book on rabbit behavior I have found. I've had rabbits for five years and read a lot about their behavior. However, this book taught me so much more. I now have a much better understanding of why my rabbits do the things they do. What I especially like about this book is that it addresses issues for both indoor and outdoor rabbits. I didn't realize how many mistakes I was making when I let my rabbits ""roam free"" outside in nice weather. For example, I did not realize that vast, open spaces in the outdoors are frightening for rabbits, especially if they don't have some enclosure in which to hide. I will not make that mistake again.Overall, this is an excellent book. It has given me much deeper insight into my rabbits' behaviors."
5,Now I know why my rabbit...,"Before you buy one, read up! Before you give up on a bunny, read this book! Before you know it, your bunny with be your buddy, too! My bunny and I bonded immediately but he wasn't always mindful of my rules... now I know why he needs to dig and chew and I provide alternatives for him. He has his own bedroom that has been completely bunny-proofed and is allowed in the half of the house that has no carpet. Cords are covered in cloth and he seems to leave them alone now. He is the best pet I have ever had and is as affectionate as a dog and as playful as a cat. He is litter trained, and I feed him only vegies and hay. This book helped me understand his fear of being in the open yard with me, and to expect him to chew and dig because he is a rabbit."
2,I'm glad I didn't buy it!,"This book lacked depth and a good foundation. I was so excited to read this book because I had heard a lot about it. However, it was really simple and predictable. The characters were flat and unintriguing. Even though the book was about Babysister, I found that I left it not knowing exactly WHO she was."
3,ok,She got excatly what she needed. At first the book was ok. Then babysister got down right nasty. What she did to her best friend was just dirty. But she got what she deserves in the end.
3,Sweetest taboo,"My bigmama always said, ""don't let no no-good man come between you and a good friend.""Oooh, Babysister, how could you?Kudos to Renee Swindle! She explored one of sisterhood's greatest taboos with finesse and a startling insight that makes me wonder if this one came from personal experience.Definitely, a must read... (and when you're done, lend it to your best friend)!"
4,Great job!,"I thought this book was well written. Renee has a way with words, something I could relate to. The book held my attention to the point where I was sneaking away from my family to go upstairs to read more. (not long periods of time). Reading is one of my favorite past times and a book like this makes reading a lot easier. It flowed well."
5,"Please, Please, Please - - the pleasure was all mine!","With sibling rivalry, gossiping co-workers, and infidelity being at the heart of this book, readers I'm sure will relate to all that is at play in this novel. Renee Swindle presents characters that are intense and engaging as they come. Babysister's willful behavior in every relationship she has either makes you love her or want to strangle her. So . . . to all the ""Babysisters"" in this world, THANKS! Without you, there would be no great stories like this one to read."
3,Was Babysister Real?,"The main character, Babysister was just not very believable to me. Babysister is friends with Deborah and Deborah is involved with and getting ready to marry Darren. The whole ""plot"" is whether or not Babysister can successfully STEAL her friend's man. As I read this book, I just kept feeling that Babysister was too unrealistic to even take this book seriously. I am not saying that there aren't ""Babysisters"" out there like this person but I am saying that I have NEVER met one! I will give the author credit though for having an original story but I just couldn't buy some of the things that Babysister did throughout the book."
5,This book is muy caliente!,"Please, please, please will keep your eyes riding the pages like a child shooting down the waterslides on a hot desert day. At first I didn't agree w/what Babysister was up to and at the same time I couldn't put the book down 'cause I HAD TO find out what she'd do next. I enjoyed hanging out w/Babysister so much I tried to pace my reading, but the book is too good to go slow.Renee Swindle can write some damn good sex scenes too. AY! I'm looking forward to her next book!"
3,Puh-leeze,"I had a problem with Babysister, the main character. She's a coniving, low down, backstabbing, self centered, spoiled, egotistical female. This is not to say that I didn't like the storyline, because I did. It was pretty fresh, Swindle went to some places that other authors dare not go. She gave Babysister a boldness that we all know truly exists. Makes you want to say,""Puh-leeze""."
2,To Vain,"There are not many books that I do not like. But this one just didn't grab my attention. I did not like Babysister from the beginning. It was so shallow and vain. Even though I know these things happen everyday, I prefer not to read about them. Babysister was just plain stupid and a spoiled brat. As I continued to read the book, I was very disappointed how the relationships of each character turned out. Hopefully Renee Swindle's next book will be better."
4,A very good first novel for Renee Swindle!!,"I thought that the book was great, entertaining, and valuable reading and a great first novel for the author, Renee Swindle (an alumnus of UC Irvine just like myself).I believe that everyone has had to learn a painful lesson in life when it comes to relationships, and this book certainly stands out as a must read.Looking forward to Renee's next novel!!"
3,A Good Book,"I really enjoyed the book. It is the type of book that you don't want to put down. Although the main characters name being ""Babysister"" was a bit of a disappointment. I believe any other common girls name would have worked just as well (i.e. Karen, Monica,)especially considering the ages of the characters in the book. All in all I really enjoyed the books true depiction of how some sisters can be deceitful to their very best friends. Plus the deceitfulness of some brothers in relationships."
4,A Vivid Page Turner,Great character development. I actually felt like I could talk to Baby Sister. The story was extremely interesting. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.
4,You'll be pleased with this appetizing read!,"""Please Please Please"" is an amusing drama that will have readers begging too. After scanning the cover, you learn that Babysister is begging. After reading the book, you learn that all the characters are begging in some way.Babysister is begging for her best friend's man, Darren. Best friend Deborah, is begging her cheating friend to talk to her. Darren is begging for his cake (Deborah), the frosting (Babysister) and ice cream on the side (co-worker). Rob begs Babysister to commit. Brother Malcolm, begs his lover, Sharice, to let him come back home after making a fool of himself. Daddy begs Babysister to come clean after years of lying and deceitfulness which he perpetuated. Readers are begging them all to get it together and do the right thing.Babysister is not the only one who gets what she wants. Readers will get lots of laughs out of this entertaining page-turner which begs readers to please, please, please read on!"
2,Please don't buy!,"This is what I call garbage reading. Babysister was just too shallow and selfish for her own good. To make matters worst, I couldn't finish reading the whole book. It was a waste in my opinion. I felt like I had to force myself to read the book. The woman and her peers obviously had no ambition whatsoever. I hate reading books stereotyping African American woman as trifling and conviving. I'm sorry, but this book was not a favorite. Hopefully Ms. Swindles next work will be more uplifting."
5,The best of the best,"I could not put Renee Swindles book down. I laughed, cried, and could not wait to reach the final pages. The excitement is similar to that of ""Trying to Sleep in the Bed you Made"", but better. I read it a year ago but I still tell all my friends and my students to get this book."
1,Cliff Notes have been better....,"If you're looking for a ""light"" read, then you may enjoy this book; however, be warned....it severly lacks depth."
1,"Oh puh-leez, puh-leez, puh-leez!","So this is what passes for writing these days: A lazy reader's Toni Morrison cum Danielle Steel. This book reads like a rehash of about fifty other novels. Babysister . . .um, isn't that from Beloved?"
4,"Babysister, was a bad girl!","I enjoyed this book tremendously that I had to hurry and buy it, I could not wait for it to go on paperback! Babysister got exactly what she deserved. What goes around comes around! You don't do that to a lifelong friend or any friend!"
3,ENTERTAINING,"After eagerly waiting to read this book, I was somewhat disappointed. Ms. Swindle did a great job of writing the book; however, it was hard to believe that Babysister could be so selfish and negative. She had nothing good to say about anyone. I liked the ending better, because Babysister got what she deserved from her father, who should have straighten her out sooner. Also, Deborah's character could have been developed more. For instance, did she have any siblings?"
3,This girl has issues!,"This book was a pretty good read. I think we can all relate to at least one of the characters in the book. The main character has a lot of flaws; however, I see that as a part of the story. I got more then a few laughs as she rationalized her behavior.This is a decent story. If you are looking for the ""meaning of life"" or something ""deep"" then this is NOT the book for you. If you are looking for something fun to read, the give it a try."
5,thank you babysister for FINALLY opening up your eyes,"man! i cannot tell you how engaging and thought provoking this whole book was for me. i mean, i could identify with babysister SO much (i never been with my best friend's man, but i've been a spoiled brat my whole, not to her extinct, but you get the point)!i must admit, i was kinda skeptical when i first looked at the cover of the book, but once i started reading, it was all good. this book actually went into the mind of what some might even say is the 'typical' hoochie mama sista, and to tell you the truth, it was actually pretty thought provoking. black women, no matter how uneducated or educated have a story to tell, though they may be filled with pain, it's a captivating story none the less of babysister's journey to becoming a TRUE woman, instead of relying on daddy to make things right. very intriguing."
3,"Please, give me a break!","In reading this book, it makes you wonder what extremes people will go to get a man! I'm sorry but what kind of name is ""Babysitter"" for one of the main characters in this story? Deborah certainly has alot more understanding of true friendship then Babysitter. Its amazing how after all the ""dirt"" she can continue to be her friend. It was an okay read. Not one that I would pass on."
4,Good Read,This book was an easy read. You liked and hated the main character at the same time. She was an interesting person andmade you want read more to see what happened.
2,She need therapy,"I read this book awhile ago. When I read it I was kinda disgusted by how Babysister acted. She did her best friend from childhood dirrrtty, you'll find out what she did. She even went a lil tooo far trying to take him back before the Wedding ceremony, he was getting married to her friend. she was so disgusting. After he got married to her friend, they had it going on."
5,Please Please give me some more!!!,"This book was exhilirating. I both liked and hated the main character Babysister. Babysister witnessed the death of her mother at a young age. After that, her father spoiled her to death. He never said no to her and so she grew up thinking she could get everything that she wanted. Babysister's best friend's name was Deborah. Deborah snagged a guy named Darren who graduated from UCLA, was an architect, and fine as hell. Deborah and Babysister worked at the same bank so she had to be the one to take Deborah the flowers Darren brought to her. After interrogating Deborah about Darren, Babysister concocted a plan to get Darren away from Deborah. This story has all kinds of twists and turns and is sure to keep you wondering. Babysister gets what she wants until she realizes that she was just a part of Darren's fool-proof game. This book is good!!!"
4,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE,"The humor was there, but the book lacked depth. From the beginning Babysister lusted and went after a man that belonged to her best friend. What ever happened to loyalty amongst friends? Despite all the backstabbing Babysister learns a lot about love and friendship. In the end they both discover that Darren aka ""Mr. Wonderful"" was nothing but a three-timing D-O-G. Just goes to show you can't judge a man by his boots. I will definitely check Ms. Swindle out the next go round."
2,Great toy but battery didn't fit.,"I bought this for my husband. He was extremely excited, just to find out that the battery didn't even fit in the inside compartment. Rather than paying to have it sent back, my husband just jury-rigged a way to keep it in there, but it still flops around while driving it. The humvee itself, my husband really enjoys. Someone should have tested the battery before packaging and sending it."
3,hole is in different location than picture,Just arrived. Looks like a good product but hole is not where it is shown in picture displayed on Amazon website. Shows hole on left and hole is actually in middle of the one delivered. Not sure if this is product error or wrong picture. Still contemplating what to do since there is no option for seller feedback on error.
1,I hate it!,"I bought this chair for reflexology, I hate it! It does not lock in place like it says it should. waste of money!"
2,Not as confortable as expected,"After reading several reviews describing how confortable this chair is I was quite disappointed. I was looking forward to using this chair for reading. However, if you like reading with back support and the legs raised you are out of luck. To raise the legs use must recline way back. There is no way to independently control raising the legs while keeping the back up. If you want a chair for sleeping in this one would be good. Also, the bar at the foot is right where my achilles tendon wants to be so my only choice is to put my feet on the bar and keep my knees bent."
2,"If you were in England,...","I might recommend this book. However, the book was not helpful to me because the book is in reference to England's government, pharmacies, or pharmacy schools and I wouldn't know how much difference there is between USA and England in pharmacy career requirements. Otherwise I was dumbfounded and the name of the book should have been called Pharmacy Careers in England."
2,"An Outline, not a Handbook, of Oracle Finanicials !","Did someone call it a Handbook? What the book offers is less than a bird's eye-view of Oracle Financials. To be fair to the authors, it is unfair to expect much in a single book on such a complex package like Oracle Financials. However, many important features of Oracle Financials are omitted and at the same time, repeated presentation of the same information, possibly on the same page, irritates you several times. Many graphics are confusing, even to a reader familiar with the topic.Despite being the only source of published information about the subject, the book disappoints you irrespective of your knowledge level of Oracle Financials."
3,This is the only book globally available on OracleFinancials,"Though this is the only book globally available on Oracle Financials, sample screens therein are only four, in spite of the large number of accounts and logistic or flexfields therein. In the absence of the same, this book on Oracle Financials will be viewed only as an addition to those already dealing with Financial Management in general."
5,Excellent Introduction,"For those critics of you out there who think that this book was not this or not that, especially the reader from Port Arthur in Tasmania, I suggest you buy an Oracle Reference Manual or Users guide. Get real! This book gives a great introduction to the core Oracle Applications and I believe it was well done. It introduces the business and Functional side to Oracle Financials. For those pretentious readers who can't spell Oracle read the cover ""Oracle Financials Handbook"" - ""Planning and Implementing the Oracle Financial Applications Suite"" No where does it say Technical Reference Manual. I'd like to see these half baked consultants write ANYTHING half as good. Well done David and Graham. If anyone cares to discuss this work email me and we'll ""CHAT"""
2,not recommended for reference,"The book is trying to cover the business as well as the technical aspect of the application, but it didn't cover either of them very well, especially the technical side. The book is not well-organized enough to be used as a reference book."
2,Thinly spread and inaccurate in parts,"This book does give quite a good overview of the applications. However, it tries to be all things to all people, and does not really succeed. The chapters on the core Financials modules are not too bad. The title of the book is a bit confusing, because Oracle renamed its suite 'Oracle Applications' some time ago; ie why would you see Inventory and Order Entry discussed in a 'Financials' Handbook? There are also quite a few inaccuracies in the book, some of which may mislead implementers."
2,No Depth,"I was extremely disappointed with the book. It gave an overview of some of the modules, but there is no depth. Also, some of what it does contain is not accurate. I've told others that if they know nothing of Oracle Applications, the book may be worth reading. Otherwise, forget it."
3,This will only book globally available on oracle financials.,"This is the only book globally available on oracle financials. But sample screens are only fournumbers of Accounts & Logistics in Oracle Financials are more. In the obsence of the same, this book will be viewed as an addition those already dealing with Oracle Financial Management"
3,Not for the Technical,"A good book for those who want to know WHAT the financials suite of applications are for, but not for those who need to delve into the intricacies of installation or day-to-day management aspects."
4,Kudos to All,.... Who has put every effort to bring this book in the market. This book is a one stop shop for businesses implementing Oracle Financials. It's time to come with similar books on other modules too. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!
1,A very average book,I have been working on Oracle apps for a year and I bought this book hoping to get more insight. But was very disappointed by the contents of the book. I feel that even for a biggener this book is not of much help.
1,doesn't fulfil the expectations..,I agree with the review made by the first reader from Washington D.C. Having waited so long this book no where matches the practicalities involved in the implementation of Oracle financials..
2,It's a start...,"I applaud the authors on their efforts, however I am disappointed in the finished product. The outdated screen shots (R10SC vs R11), incorrect integration (there is no interface between OE and GL) and misleading information (i.e. AutoAccounting functionality varies between Projects and Receivables) concerns me greatly. If someone is looking for an overview of how Oracle Applications function in general, this book will be a help. If they are going to be working on an implementation, they definately need more research than this book will offer.To the reader who wondered why Order Entry and Inventory should be included...despite how Oracle chooses to bundle the products - these two applications have definite financial implications -- please don't remove them from future editions."
5,The Book was Very Good Condition,The Book condition is very good. I felt like a almost new book. I would recommend to buy from this seller.
4,Good overview and highlights on certain topics,"I think that it is great that books on Oracle Applications are being published as there are not many out there.I bought this one and have passed it onto colleagues who are new to Applications. Looking forward to reading and using the one from Que in Sept/Oct.Books such as this compliment the Oracle manuals, user groups and various web sites/ newsgroups that are out there focusing on Oracle Applications.As support would tell you ""your issue is not a bug but a consultancy/ implmentation issue"". The more information available from consultants who have or do work with Apps the wealthier the Apps community."
5,Las mejores canciones infantiles,"Este album contiene una selección de buenísimas canciones infantiles. Hace 22 años era mi disco favorito y también lo fue de mi hermana hace unos 26 años. Las canciones de este disco ahora se las canto a mis hijos y son sin exagerar canciones que jamás se olvidan. Suerte para quienes deseen comprarlo, yo todavía extraño el que nosotras teníamos, si tuviese como comprarlo ya lo hubiese hecho."
1,Shoddy public-domain edition of a great book,"This review is only for any non-Random House paperback version of this book on Amazon. Did you know My Father's Dragon is now in the public domain? I didn't. That means anybody who wants to can put out their own crappy-looking print-to-order version. You might save a few bucks (or not, I'm not sure) but you get what you pay for: a thin, ugly volume with all the production values of a college alumni directory or community theater playbill. Weird fonts, washed-out art, some low-resolution scans, etc. Buyer beware--don't click on the wrong version of this like I did!"
4,"short, fun chapter book","Silly enough for most any kid to enjoy, short enough for a brand-new-to-chapter-books attention span, this is a great book.Lots of ""surprises"" in the story for the kids. They would keep asking for another chapter and another. We didn't take many nights to read the whole thing.A quick, fun book to enjoy together."
1,Harlequin Romance with a Buggy,"A horribly done example of ""chick lit"" with a horse attached. The writing style is very stilted and not very readable. The main character is an older female who just happens to attract a young male admirer (some sort of fantasy on the author's part). A very poor mystery is added to the mix with a background of carriage driving.So, you have money, carriages, horses, ripped-bodices, young guy lusting after an older woman...all that was needed was unicorn and a pirate with an eye-patch and you have a classicly-god-awfully written almost crotch novel.Absolute rubbish, save your funds and eyes. If male, don't even think of reading this book without watching 16 hours of afternoon television to numb your brain."
4,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good book for learning HTML and XHTML. It's very basic, and perfect for a beginner. Most codes are explained thoroughly, however, sometimes the author just writes a code to do a job and doesnt explain how it works or how exactly to use it.It has ALOT of important information about creating a website and how to test a website, so you can meet all your users needs.I would recommend this book to a beginner who wants to learn more about HTML/XHTML or someone who would like a great reference book."
1,Battery will last 4 months tops!,"Even though my spouse runs the battery until it is dead after each use, we still went through 4 of these vacuums (each a warranty claim) in 18 months because the battery life dwindles in 4 months to the point where nothing gets vacuumed.Avoid this and the 9.6 volt Black & Decker cordless hand vacuum. Perhaps Black & Decker should replace the rechargeable nickel-cadium batteries with rechargeable lithium-ion batteries on all of their cordless vacuums?"
2,Killer Whales is Killer Boring,"Killer Whales starts out with a little hope but quickly dwindles down to a real bore.This movie is half an hour of watching Killer whales' fins coasting around in the same exact location. That's it for footage except for a quick look at the Vancouver aquarium and a close up of seagulls (whoopee!), a bald eagle and a couple seals.The entire movie is water and a handful of fins. Very, very disappointing."
4,Nice overview of hex signs and history,Provides the basics on the region of SE PA known for PA Dutch hex signs. I purchased it to provide ideas for creating my own hex signs. It will be a big help for this purpose. Lots of great photos of beautiful barns.
1,beautiful canister if it weren't broken,Well I've gone thru three shipments for this thing so far and while the canister itself is seemingly beautiful I can't really tell because it keeps arriving either in pieces or cracked.The original manufacturer's box is very thin single wall cardboard. It would help greatly if the Amazon shipping department folks wrapped the original manufacturers box in a couple layers of bubblewrap before chucking it into the corner of a huge Amazon box with those big air packets that don't do diddly squat to keep fragile things safe.A little common sense in the shipping department would rectify the breakage of fragile items quickly. Here's hoping that round 4 they actually read my email suggesting bubblewrap first so I can get this thing in time for mother's day. Sheesh!
1,not worth it,"This book is a simple picture book with about 10 to 12 words for every two pages (without any real definitions, simply a setting with the right word pasted next to it). Even our five year old found it boring and barely uses it. Do not buy this book uless you have pre-kinder children who are ready to learn different words."
2,Don't buy this product!!!!!!!!!,This pendant is made out of cheap quality. Within a week of giving this to my girlfriend 3 of the little crystals have fallen off. All of the crystals weren't even the same color. The right side of it was blue and the left side of it was white. It was honestly a waste of money.
4,Beautiful Boot,"These boots are gorgeous. Needed the stitch down construction as I work a job where the footbed of my shoes is constantly seperating from the rest of the shoe. Only problem with this product is its been a couple of months now and they are still not broken in. The leather is firm to the point of bruising my ankles. I had to buy another pair of shoes to wear every other day. However, I'm convinced that once I do get these broken in, they'll be hands-down the best boots I've ever owned."
2,"Decent 'phones, weak (fragile) design","These headphones seem okay, though are pretty basic. The problem is a tiny piece of plastic that provides a stop to keep tension on the swivel. It is a weak link, and breaks easily. It is a stupid design, cause it is so easy to break and makes the headphones useless. I have a pair I am trying to fix that my sister broke, and she is bummed about it. One does not have to abuse these to break them - a slight bit of pressure and the leverage on the earcup is enough to break the 1mm wide piece of plastic that keeps these on your head. I think I can put something stronger there to make them usable, but shouldn't have to."
1,SIMBA?...,"Some students in the band own this..It's good for the first year but need to dispose after..pads are not good quality, keys are weak and can bend easily,got good tone for few months before making leaks... need to be upgraded after a year or you are going to spend all your money for repairs."
4,"Good, but a let down from previous seasons","This season probably has the highest number of fantastic episodes. Unfortunately, it has a few real stinkers as well, including the most notorious where the producers betrayed the fans.* * *My kids and I just rewatched the entire series. While this season has a few good episodes, it has some real clunkers and doesn't hold up as well."
1,Missing Episodes,"As far as Highlander goes, this was one of the best seasons. My complaint is that I purchased this from Best Buy then contacted Anchor Bay directly regarding this ""complete"" season 5 is missing 2 episodes. Episodes 1 ""one Minute To Midnight"" and episode 17 ""Double Jeopardy"" are not included. Anchor Bay has been useless in resolving this issue for me. I have read a review in this Amazon site that has made mention of Double Jeopardy and am wondering if any one has purchased this set and actually gotten all 20 episodes. If so could you please direct me to where to purchase this. I welcome any feed back at bbenevides@comcast.net."
5,how I retired at 26,"I was under the impression that at my age and with all my international experince, there is nothing a 26 year old could tell me that was worth my time or patience.Asha Tyson changed all that. She kind of reminded me of an African proverb that says: A young person sometimes can give advice to an elder but the young should never insult nor disrespect the elder.The principles that Asha writes about are universal and will truly work for anyone. She impressed me mostly by overcoming all her trials and challenges, and living to be a proof that 'It is not what happens to you that makes or destoys you; it is how you react to what happens to you'. It is taking complete responsibility to all you failures and triumphs. To all events in your life.I have children older that Asha and I had them read the book.Mike Kamuyu"
5,Wow!! I'm so impressed,Who would a girl from Detroit who did not have the best childhood would make such an impact in my life. After reading the book and all the reviews it looks like Asha Tyson is inspiring the World. Not all authors share their true background and then give you the tools they used to inspire them to make their dreams come true. Thank you Asha for sharing with the World!!
3,"The title was a bit misleading (Asha's definition of retirement,)","however, I did enjoy reading her personal story in the beginning of the book. I became inspired. Page 73 confused me when she tells the reader about her decision to attend graduate school instead of law school and out from nowhere she tell us ""Even though I experienced my share of ups and downs as a higher education executive, I continued to throw myself into the industry by working, studying, and becoming familiar with all the particulars of the profession."" Wow, how, when, where did she become a higher education executive and at such a young age? The ""how-to"" is missing. There a alot of holes in her story after she left for college. Unfortunately, as the book progresses, the story telling ends and the ""self-help"" portion begins. The book is like alot of motivational books out there. Nothing new, just from a different perspective. Overall, I did enjoy the book and will be checking out her website."
1,Title is deceiving,"When I think of retiring, what comes to mind is having enough money to live on without working. This is not what Asha did. She just got tired of working at a job and quit--with no money. She lucked into motivational speaking and wrote one book (this one) that is full of the positive-thinking platitudes like all the rest. Sorry to be the boy who pointed out that the King is really naked."
2,This title is meant to mis-lead buyers.,"This book should have been titled ""How I Got My First Job At 26 And Then Started Planning For My Retirement"" It's a book about how Asha Tyson expanded her awareness. It's full of inspirational zingers gleaned form other writers but she never get's to the 'how to'.Here is her definition of retirement ""Retirement is taking on the responsibility as a brilliant life form to make a contribution with your gifts."" What???She also says that anyone can do what she has done but then says,""By age nine, I was narrating plays and giving keynote addresses at banquet halls for award and appreciation ceremonies."" Also, ""...I'd always had charisma,drive, and stamina..."" Sounds like a GIFTED person to me!Hey folks, save your money, Think and Grow Rich is still a great read."
3,Not as great as everyone is making it out to be,"This book was not at all what I expected. Don't get me wrong, I was not expecting a gett rich plan book. Tyson made some excellent points. However, I believe some it is is fluff. It is missing depth."
4,"Finally - Photo's, Photo's, Photo's","This is a great little book. It provides the perfect balance of technical information without getting wordy, and a great selection of photographs. If you want a story go elsewhere. It includes the very rarely covered Super Corsair with some super pic's.It may not be physically a big book but pound for pound its a champ.Only negative: More More More!Note: Other recommended reading;Wet Wings and Drop Tanks by Birch Matthews, Schiffer AviationSupershow by Dennis Baldry, Osprey"
3,First Story,"Except for the first story, which is what the title story, it was not that great of a collection. Some amusing parts and Plimpton is likable but ok at best."
3,It's an Okay Yarn,"You can get a better deal buying in stores. As far as the yarn, I was disappointed the thread was tied at certain points to make this bulk size. I ordered the pound of yarn to make blankets for my first grandchild. I wanted a continuous length of yarn I would not have to tie together and weave in the end pieces. Well I had to weave in the ends in anyway, lol. I was also disappointed that the threads were unravelled at certain points, making the thickness uneven in places. The thread also caught on my chrochet hook which hindered my rhythem/speed. Would I buy this product again? Now that I am aware of its imperfections, yes I would for certain projects. But I'd wait for a buy two for the price of one sale. lol"
2,i ordered 3 skeins,"i ordered three skeins of this yarn. when i received the items, i received three separate dye lots. really? i was not notified prior to receiving the items that this was happening. it is pretty obvious that they are not of the same lot. two are similar but one is way off. i'm disappointed about that."
3,Not very soft,"I loved the idea of one long strand of yarn, especially for a baby blanket, but the yarn was not nearly as soft as I had hoped."
5,Great color,"Love the color. I bought it with the Antique White Pound of Love. I'm making a baby blanket.It really looks beautiful & is easy to work with. It has a nice feel to it, & a good weight without being too heavy."
1,weeks late...,"normally this is good yarn, but certainly not worth the 6 week wait for items that were in stock and supposed to ship in 1-2 days. There was a 4 for 3 promotion, so I bought 16. I must have missed the fine print that said the free portion would be shipped a month and a half after the regular priced order. I would have been better off at Walmart!"
5,Swizzle stick minimalism,"They're plastic. Basically palm tree shaped. In Chinese factory green number 17. Also used for plastic frogs and some 3.5"" floppy disk cases back in the day. Nothing more, nothing less. A statement of simple living. Simple tiki bar living anyway. Mash some mint leaves. Squeeze some limes (fresh juice is really rather important). Match the color. And shake over ice."
2,Poor Don,"Were it not for Jose Van Dam, this video would be a sham.Apparently modernized, it has no resemblance to the original story Recorded in 2010, it is also recorded in stereo sound only. SAD>"
2,SKIP THIS ONE,"In the introduction the author apologizes to the reader for not being able to include 'every shipwreck' in the text. Some readers, he noted, were bound to be upset that a particular sinking was left out. Now of course we all know no book could cover every shipwreck or every disaster at sea, but certainly one could do better than this. As it is, all but a very few are given no more than a paragraph, making this more of a dictionary than encyclopedia. On top of it all, the book is filled with errors. The reader might just as well stick to the list of sinkings provided at the end, and ignore the text. Ritchie writes well, and could have produced an exellent work if only he had spent more time on the research and organization."
3,"Interesting, but not first rate.","This is a good effort, but not difinitive. It was hard to tell by what criteria some wrecks were covered in detail and others bacame footnotes. I would have liked more pictures as well."
3,Not such a bargain,"Check out ""Rhythm and Blues Revue"" ""ASIN: B002W8NRD0"" as it is of equal quality and includes both ""Basin Street Revue"" and a collection of musical shorts:1) Beat Me, Daddy - Maurice Rocco2) She's Too Hot to Handle - Bob Howard3) Everybody's Jumpin' Now - Noble Sissle and his Orchestra with Mable Lee4) Sepia Sirens - Artie Young in her famous ""Jungle Dance""5) Sepia Sirens - Fances Grey, Tall, Tan and Terrific in her ""Harlem Fan Dance""6) Sepia Sirens - Doris Ake presenting ""The Pearl Harbor Hula""7) Sepia Sirens - Avanel - Sensational Stripper from the Lena Horne Ballet8) Mildred and Bow - The Quality Sisters in ""Boogie Woogie"""
5,Definately a source for positive influence and outlook.,"I intend to purchase the book as a replacement for my husband. When I first met him he would read the book everyday!! I picked it up a couple of times to read and found it amazing and most uplifting. I noticed my husband utilizing the information towards the relationships he encountered, and people would respond in a positive manner regardless of the situation. Let Go, Let God is a must have resource on the road to Christian rebirth and living."
5,A Great and Inspirational Tape,I highly recommend this tape for those who need their spirits lifted.
1,Worst Shoe Ever,"While these shoes are pretty, they are THE most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn (and I wear heels every day). I can barely make it to my desk and back to my car in one day with these shoes on. Don't buy them, you will regret it."
5,Great for beginners or advanced students and researchers,"The is the best SPSS book I have ever read, and I think I've read them all! It goes beyond the basic beginner's text, and yet I think new SPSS users, and new Stat students would also find this book understandable and useful. Field's explicit and well organized descriptions and explanations of the theory, methods,diagnostic steps, and interpretation of output for various statistical procedures are fantastic, and he has a wry sense of humor that reminds us that reasearch can actually be exciting and fun (honestly!). I know I will use this book for years to come, and will buy new editions as they are printed."
5,Clear and concise,"Dr. Field,Has written a book that should be an example to all others writing about: 1. SPSS and 2. Research methods. As a grad student I have been trying to put together all the stats classes that I have taken and the SPSS class I took and make sense out of it. This book was the final key that brought it all together. Based on logic ... its funny that the science of statistics should be so without logic as far as teaching goes. Again, this book is the way that books on stats and SPSS should be written. My only problems: 1. That while there is a lot covered, I wish that he would go through all (or almost all) of the statistical applications available in SPSS and 2. I would've liked to see a ""refresher"" on the commands to complete the statistical process talked about, at the end of the chapter. In summary, this book is the only book that I would recommend to those in need of help regarding SPSS and statistics. I can't wait for his new book, co-authored by Dr. Hole."
2,Poorly written,"I attended a book signing for Dead Mars, Dying Earth before it was released to bookstores. At that signing, I spoke with John Brandenburg at length about the topics of the book and many more. To me he came across as quite arrogant--a man who seems to enjoy talking about the shortcomings of others and his own success. While the book covers some very sensitive issues that are absoultely essential to the Earth's future, Brandenburg does it in a way that makes it sound like he sould be the hero of the world for realizing certain things. On top of all of this is the fact that the book was poorly edited. It is littered with typos and grammatical errors, making the reading difficult at times. Despite all of these things, the book handles some things quite well and is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the future of the Earth. However, for the scientifically minded reader, I don't recommend it."
1,Content differs from the title...,"The book is ok in opening the mind to an idea and a relevant one, and raises a fundamental question all right... but that needed 10 crisp pages. Most of the book is desultory and digressive, with a forced storylike approach that seems almost artificial and is definitely distracting. The author also is bold enough to come with his baggage of biases, which is again often re-narrated, to a point where his patriotism, anti communism, anti Russia and Cold war references bring about a nausea; since it seems unrelated to the issue being raised.The issue really raised is how Earth is dying with Global warming, and is probably going to end up like Mars. But the book veers with so many different digressions and irrelevant narrations... it gets lost.This is not a book you should read, instead a good Asimov novel is a better bet."
2,Ouch...,"Ok, the book is good because it does try to open your eyes on environmental problems. The book is not so good because Brandenburg is a little bit alarmist, but I won't really complain about that. The but is quite bad because Brandenburg seems to have some score to settle with someone, and IT SHOWS! A little bit partial, uh? And the book is really bad, because some of the science in there is completely bogus, and it stains all the rest..."
5,An Excellent Seeker's Bible,"""The Journey"" is a very user-friendly NIV Bible that is particularly geared toward the seeker. The testimonies, insert boxes throughout and introductions for each new chapter bring the messages of the Bible into a contemporary context. These 'helpers' enhance the reader's understanding of key messages in the Bible and help guide the reader throughout. The personal stories at the end of each book remind the seeker that they 'aren't the only ones' and really personalize the experience of reading the Bible and understanding its potential in the world we live in today. I would recommend ""The Journey"" to every seeker and Christian alike."
5,Great Bible for Devotional Time,"I thoroughly enjoy reading the Journey Bible for my personal devotion time. I like the different type of paper used because it makes it easier to write notes, and mark and highlight passages. I also love the info boxes throughout the text. They are very insightful and informative. The Five Alive Reading is a wonderful reading plan for not only new bible readers but also for mature Christians. This bible is very special to me since it's the bible I use during my personal time with the Lord and I have so many insights recorded."
5,Great Bible,"This is a great bible for anyone who has questions about out creator etc. .I bought it as a gift, and then bought it for myself. Even though it's geared for the seeker I believe it's good for anyone that loves Gods word. I have several great study bibles in hardback and bought this as my first Kindle book purchase. I highly recommend it ."
4,My favorite Bible,"My first Bible as an adult was the Journey, from church (Willow Creek), and I lost it. Willow doesn't sell them anymore so I was happy to find it on amazon! Wish it was the original, sand cover, but that's okay. I like the ""seeker stories"" in this Bible, it's great at relating passages to real life."
4,Very Upbeat,"I bought as as Amazon recommendation and thought it would fit in my ""exercise collection"" It definitely fits that bill and is mostly upbeat music. I would classify it in the Smooth Jazz Uptempo genre."
5,Excelente,"Muy Buen Grupo no los conocia, me lo sugu¡irieron USTEDES ya que Yo, escucho Spyro Gyra, Muy Bueno"
4,"Almost Perfect!!! But I can't give ""Moonlighting"" 5 Stars...","...Thanks to Kenny G. He is the worst Saxophonist on the face of the earth and his presence on this album resulted in me rating this album 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Of course all the other songs that don't feature Kenny g like the title track, ""Angela"" and ""Dreams"" are great.4 Stars, Sorry"
1,Hard to dance,My mother purchased this toy for my daughters fifth birthday. We gave it to her this morning before school and she played with it for twenty minutes before it was time to go to school. When she was playing with it she had trouble pushing the plunger on the head without her falling over. (She is only standing on her one tip toe when she lifts her other leg.) Once you got it going it was fun for her for a few minutes. When she got home from school she picked it up to play with it and she no longer sang and danced at the same time. She had to put her back in Demo mode to get her to sing. but she still spins. I changed the batteries in case that was the problem but it did not resolve. I cant possibly see how a three year old can get this doll to dance. We are now on our way to return her and get something different. Good Luck
3,"Daughter loves it, but doesn't work right.","Like the previous reviewer, my 3-year-old cannot make this doll dance without help, which frustrates her. An additional problem is that the hair gets wound around the crown-plunger a few times a week, and then I have to unwind it so she'll dance again. Also, she only sings ONE song. Okay, it's a cute song and all, but after you've heard it several hundred times, you will be looking for the battery hatch to remove the souce of evil! Still, my daughter loves her, even after a year. She is very cute, I have to admit, so she gets 3 stars instead of 1."
2,"entertaining, yet unoriginal.","I guess i had higher expectations for this book from reading the back. But i found another unoriginal, not to thrilling murder mystery instead. Not awful, just nothing special. Read at your own risk."
2,Babbling,"I completely subscribe by the long list of this book's shortcomings mentioned by the previous reviewers (total lack of coverage for the IP stack, for one), however the one thing that gives me the most heartburn is the total and blind adoration that the author displays for his subject. Obviously, this is the only OS kernel that Mr.Maxwell is familiar with, thus he has no reference point for comparison (I would suggest NetBSD). The source code that I am looking at, deserves lots and lots of critique, to put it mildly!"
3,A Good Decent Buy,"Contains 2 CD's. One is titled MAXIMUM NINE INCH NAILS, other is titled NINE INCH NAILS X-POSED THE INTERVIEW. First one is an unauthorised biography, and second is just a interview CD with Trent Reznor."
1,Beware,"This book is a paperback exact reprint of the 1884 original edition which was 500+ pages long. If reset and printed today it would be 150 to 200 pages. It discusses different types of crimes with no mention of Pinkerton's problems with the James, the Reno's, the labor unions, and protecting Lincoln during the Civil War. This book is a disappointment, and not worth spending anytime with, or spending money to purchase."
1,"Meandering, name-dropping mess !","If you are looking for an incisive, interesting book on France, click off this site immediately. This book is impossible to read; seems to have been written for the amusement of a few friends or fellow writers. There is nothing to hold on to here, nothing follows in any perceptible order. I can't imagine how any publisher accepted this mess. You will not learn anything from this book except how to write a self-indulgent piece that should be used as an example of how not to write. That says it all."
3,loud,"This toy was a big hit with my 4-year-old on Easter morning, but he's not exactly soft and cuddly, since the insides hold the mechanics and the batteries. There's supposed to be a sensor under his chin, to make him bark when you scratch him, but I can't find any. When you wave your hand in front of his face, he moves his head and barks. Difficult for my child to get this feature to work, but easier for me. I guess the ultimate measure of this toy's quality is whether or not your kid likes it, and mine does!"
3,i bought this for my 3yr old and i felt she was to old for it,She liked it for less than a week now its in her room on a shelf not being played with. I feel its for younger children.
1,Didn't care for this,Not what I expected. Full of old techniques that seem outdated at this time. The book is more about facing old demons than focusing.
3,"Okay, but RiverMaps is better","Bought this and RiverMaps guide to San Juan. While this one has some nice info about local flora and fauna, RiverMaps is packed with info. Almost returned this, but figured some of the natural history stuff makes it worth having."
3,only half worked,"bought 2 of this item, only one worked. the one that does, works fine. I was unable to replace the second one as there was no more available."
2,"Clear sound, interesting features, not so comfortable.","This is a just ok bluetooth headset. It does not fit well, is loud, but people on the other end hear echo and themselves sometimes, not very good in loud areas. The earpiece sits over the ear, I prefer in the ear. Battery life is just ok too."
1,Simply horrible,"The sound quality receiving was not bad, but no one could ever hear me. One day I got to hear what it sounded like on my answering machine and I couldn't even understand myself and Iwas not even driving at the time or anything."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this headset and tried it for a week. In a nutshell, it is practically useless. When used indoors, your callers complain there is an echo. Outdoors, it is barely audible. If there is a wind, it is completely useless. It is very comfortable on the ear. Too bad it does not work as advertised. Someone needs to go back to the drawing board at Bodyglove/Fellowes. This was attempted using a Treo 650."
2,"Unfortunately, a waste of money","Unfortunately, this item does not perform well and is not worth ordering.The good:This headset has a nice design and conveniently folds up for easy storage.The pairing was very easy with my Sony mobile.The headset itself is reasonably light on your ear.The Bluetooth range was good between headset and mobileThe Bad:Sound quality is not good.Voice dialing rarely worked because of the poor mic receptionThe people you speak to can hear every background noise around you over your voice.Either party can hear an echo when the volume is turned up.The volume needs to be turned up to the higher setting in order to hear a conversation.Static, static, static unless you remain perfectly still in a completely quite room.End result: I returned it and purchased the Sony Ericsson Akono HBH -660 which is EXCELLENT!"
2,Save your money -- put it towards a unit that works,"Why bother? My own father couldn't recognize my voice when I used it. I was told by more than one person that it sounded as if I was talking with my head in the toilet. All of that, coupled with an utter lack of comfort. I'm only giving it two stars because it did actually turn on. Put your $35 towards a bluetooth headset that was developed by engineers rather than mental patients. Good luck."
2,Noisy noisy noisy...,That's what my friends say whenever I called them wearing this set. I have a Motorola V710. It doesn't have any problems pairing up and stuff. But clarity sucks. I bought it and used for a week and then returned it. I won't recommend it to anyone.
2,I would not buy it again.,"Very uncomfortable to wear. The sound quality is not bad on my side but the person I called keeps hearing an echo. Do not wear it in the wind, no one will be able to hear you."
1,A mountain of lies and anti-catholic bigotry.,"About ten years ago, I tried to read this book.Because it's so bad, I didn't finished.It isn't only only outdated, it's also ridiculous, false, bigoted and has a lot of false prophecies.In fact, this book is false about the past, present and future.I shoul tell everybody, that I'm not a catholic.I even enjoy true critics against Roman Catholicism, but this book is false and ridiculous.It has only frauds and bigotry.Don't waste your time and money with this trash-book."
1,This book ranks right up there. . .,". . . with similar kooky titles suggesting that the Queen of England is the world's greatest drug dealer!This volume, suggesting an international conspiricy between the Vatican, Moscow, and Washington, DC, is fanatical, hysterical, irrational and, since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, hopelessly dated (not to mention, proven wrong!)"
1,Ethics? Author's bias is extreme,"I found it ironic that the author of an ethics book would include arguments that anyone with an elementary knowledge of statistics could see through. Asserting causality from correlations, the author pushes his political agenda from the opening chapter. His bias is extreme; his agenda is thinly veiled"
5,"Recommended. Good mainstream novel, full of sex and humor.","I'm a long-time fan of Christopher Fahy's horror and suspense novels. This book is a good mainstream novel about a 42-year-old teacher during his mid-life crisis. The teacher, Ted Wharton, has an affair with a beautiful 17-year-old high school student from his Honors Psychology class -- with disastrous consequences.The beginning and end of the book are very funny, and the book is solid and involving throughout.I recommend this book, as well as Fahy's horror novels ""Nightflyer,"" ""Dream House,"" and ""The Lyssa Syndrome.""I also recommend his story collections, particularly ""Limerock.""Fever 42: 4 1/2 stars.(Note: I read only the hardcover version.)"
5,Outstanding!,This book was an outstanding and excellent book. It is very tragic and John Walsh really gets into your heart in this one.
5,Absolutely Terrific!,This book was extremely well written and held my absolute interest until the very end! You could see the sincerety that John Walsh portrays and the absolute horror of the world he faces everyday. Definately recommended reading!
1,Leaky Bottom!,"This one's a leaker! This hummingbird feeder is very, very pretty, but has a major functional design flaw. The removable plug makes it convenient to fill the feeder. However, the plug ends up at the bottom of the feeder when the feeder is hanging, and herein lies the problem. The normal temperature variation over the course of the day (up to 20 deg difference between the high and low temp on a normal day) causes expansion and contraction of the plastic parts. This makes the plug move just enough to cause the feeder to leak. Bummer, because I really liked the way the feeder looked. It is well made otherwise, but sadly this design flaw caused my feeder to drain within ~3 days from the constant dripping (not from hummingbirds). I decided to throw out the feeder one week after I received it."
2,Very pretty but also pretty leaky,"Unfortunately, unlike the other reviewer, I did not have good luck with this lovely feeder. Mine leaked constantly at the seam in the bottom half of the feeder-- which also came apart into two pieces if I unscrewed the glass reservoir. This feeder was also H-E-double-hockey-sticks to reassemble after cleaning. There are much ""EZ""-er to Fill feeders out there.However, it is much, much prettier in person. The picture doesn't do it justice at all, and the hummers liked it, but I took it down because of the leaks and the dread of reassembly after refilling it.Buy it if: 1)you have a shady place to hang it-- the sun seems to cause most of the leaking problems, 2) you aren't clutzy like me, and 3) you are endowed with patience in case the bottom part in advertently gets disassembled and you have to line it back up while simultaneously threading it to the glass reservoir."
1,Don't even bother,I purchased this item to set eyelets for setting eyelets in my artisan greeting cards. The only word to describe it - horrible! It would not punch holes into cardstack and made mush out of my eyelets. I even had my husband try (to make sure I wasn't doing it wrong)... he couldn't get it to work either. Don't waste your money. Fiskars needs to rethink their tool.
4,Good!,"i got this at walmart because i needed to use up my hundred some eyelets. it works pretty well. it takes a few times to get the hole through, but it is worth it. it works best when you clean out the inside of the punch every once in a while. when you are actually setting the eyelet, it takes a few tries, but you can get it down really flat. i use this product a lot and i would say it is definatly a good investment! the only thing i have to admit is it is fairly loud so if you are planning on using it while your kids are sleeping or somthing, it may not be the best product for you. and the other bad thing is i sometimes have trouble desiding which one to use, but that is more me than the setters. they are really nice and i would highly suggest them over many of the other products on the market!"
3,Works Best on Sturdy Surface,"I have owned these for about three years. They work sufficiently, but I prefer the Provo Craft Silent Setter.If you have them, I would like to give one bit of advice. My friend and I scrapbook on folding tables and that surface does not seem stable enough to stop the spring and transfer that blow to the eyelet (if that makes sense).Use this on a sturdier work surface or perhaps a vinyl/tile floor, it sets with fewer pulls on the spring. Of course, always make sure you have a self-healing mat or some other protection under the page! I wouldn't want to be responsible for you piercing your vinyl floor."
3,Making a mark,"""Skin and Ink"" is a somewhat entertaining collection built on the premise that every story must have a tattoo as a central focus. After that, anything goes. While it certainly makes an interesting idea, it also makes the stories disparate reads. The ones that stay more focused on relationships and family (""Winter Count"" and ""Erasing Sonny"") fare the best. Also a kick is the fantastical ""The Angelick Book.""Something else that is noteworthy about ""Skin and Ink"" is that the locales for more than a few of the pieces veer off the usual gay Mecca to other places. Philadelphia and Arkansas (in another of this book's highlights, the cheater's downfall of ""Alibis"") make for two of the diverse settings for some of the key tales. It makes for a pleasant change from the typical San Francisco or New York settings that are standard issue for most gay writing."
2,Works...barely,"I purchased one of these for my Dell Axim x51v, so that I could use the Axim as a GPS unit with my Bluetooth GPS. While it did charge the unit, I only found out after purchasing it that it will not charge the axim while the axim is running.Needless to say, I was very dissapointed because this device did not suit my needs. For the majority of users out there seeking to charge their Axim from place to place, this may be a good thing, but for those of us who like to use the axim while charging...no go."
1,Disappointing,"This was a waste of time. Brown leads the girls in a dialogue that is not realistic. She practically holds their hand, and puts words in their mouth the entire way. The most frustrating part of it all: she would not let the reader just read the girls' dialogues. After every half page of speaking, she would interrupt with ridiculous interpretations and analysis. She told the girls what to say and the reader what to think.Her vocabulary was way over the top. Her language just screams that she is trying to impress somebody. She really seemed to miss the point in most of her interpretations. She talked in huge $25-word circles, and never said a thing."
5,Wonderful Book,"I can only agree with WichacpiHoskila's review, though it appears we are from different backgrounds. I am a cradle-born Roman Catholic turned Anglo-Catholic with an interest in Native American history](as well as my bookWho Have the Powerthat incorporates all this and has led me further on the path). Anyway, I found the Christology chapter especially stimulating. There is so much to admire in how the authors constructed this book - the depth of the scholarship, the respect for dialogue, and the reading of Scripture. I will continue to study it and recommend it to others."
1,Forgive my typos-I'm using it now!!,"If I could give this a zero star rating, I would. I've always like Logitech's mouse products, but this keyboard is terrible!The media keys have a cheap look to them, but more importantly, the regular keys are all scrunched together. Just typing this, I look like I'm playing the world's smallest piano. The home/delete/end keys are not in their standard configuration, and the delete key is now 'conveniently' the same size as 'enter' and 1/8"" apart.Rather than make the entire keyboard larger to accomodate the media keys, they simply reduced spacing on the standard keys-so you have all the inconvenience of a mini laptop keyboard without the portability.The media keys can be programmed, but other keyboards have these features without forgetting the main function of a keyboard-to be able to type!!"
3,I have to agree with the previous reviewer,"The keys are too close together!! I like the media keys but the regular keys for typing are awful. I wish I had not gone with this one. I should have bought the HP Media Keyboard. Shallow keys and too close together make for lots of typos!! Good thing I only paid $14 for it, or I would have been more upset."
5,"It's a KEYBOARD,what do you want","It is a good serviceable, easy to use keyboard. It doesn't dance, it doesn't sing, it does keyboard stuff. It DOES have some good media keys, easy to figure out. And I hope I will never find out how ""fluid-resistant"" it is, but I probably will........."
5,princess collection,I ordered the collection for my little girl's 4th birthday princess party; they were the perfect size to go on the top of the castle cake. They now reside in a dollhouse and are played with every day-I'm very pleased with the purchase.
2,Disney Princesses too generic,The picture of this toy looked more attractive than the toy turned out to be. Hard plastic with no moving parts.
5,Great Value,"Very good value, in fact can't believe that is all it costs! Never have I seen such quality for the price."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was so so so disappointed in this item. The dolls' faces are SO ugly. Jasmine looks downright evil. I am wondering if I inadvertently purchased a very expensive knock-off item. I couldn't wait to give this to my daughter, but now am worried it will traumatize her."
4,My daughter loves playing with these figurines,"This is exactly the same set of figurines you can purchase at the Disney Store, if they have them in stock. My daughter (age 2) loves these princesses. They actually come in the current oval plastic container. The vendor shipped them quickly, and they are exactly what I was expecting to receive."
2,Ugliest Princesses Around,"I bought these for my princess-obsessed daughter, and while she doesn't mind them, I must say these are the ugliest figurines I have ever seen. Something must have been off with the toy assembly machines because their faces are all skewed."
5,Great set- esp. since Pocahontas is hard to find,"I never thought when I bought these for my 4 yr-old neice they would be her favorite toys! She plays with them EVERY DAY! I bought it for my daughter as well when she was five. Most of the new sets I've seen at other stores have replaced Pocahontas with Tianna. My neice likes Tianna but Pocahontas is her favorite princess so I'm glad this is still for sale on Amazon.If your child enjoys these, I recommend also Papo princess figurines which are exactly the same size so your child can invite more ladies to the ball! Papo has a 'prince' figure, too."
1,Some times sick is just sick,"I can not believe the positive reviews on this anime. The very thought of older men lusting after their HS age sisters should have stopped me after the 1st episode, but I was silly enough to think it could not possibly be going where it looked like it was. If you are looking for a good Shojo story this is not it. The relation ship is creepy and uncomfortable to watch. The creators seemed to have worked hard to make this seem normal but the thought just kept jumping into my head while I watched, ""She is your kid sister man get a grip on yourself!!!""If you are looking for an anime that trolls the gutters of Japanese sub-culture then this is your ticket. But if you are looking for a fun love story, keep looking."
4,A wealth of information!,"This book is much more than a ""how to"" book for bodybuilding. It truly is an encyclopedia of bodybuilding! Arnold goes into great depth regarding bodybuilding history, exercise selection and execution, and nutrition.The photos of old school and modern bodybuilders are truly motivational. Plus, Arnold's wealth of knowledge coupled with his inspiring writing style makes it a must have in your bookshelf. My only suggestion is to work out less frequently than he recommends to avoid over training, but the remaining information is sound advice."
4,inspiration only,Nice book for inspiration from a legend with plenty of photos to inspire. But if you are looking for routines and diets to follow to help you excel as a bodybuilder naturally this might not be the best book for you.
5,A usefull book both in sport and life,"I enjoyed Arnold's effort to write this book. Arnold's guidlines and adwises in this book are useful both to become a good sportman and as well in other aspects of life. Arnold's self made success and his way to become whom he is very valuable. These valuables secrets can be seen in his effort to write such complate bible about bodybuilding. He has left nothing unwritten and as well he has avoided repeating telling the same thing. This book as he say, take hand of bigginer and guide him to bodybuilding and the necasary attetude to become a bodybuilder. This as well guide advanced bodybuilders to rich the top. I not only enjoyed learning about boybuilding by this book, but also, I enjoyed getting to know Arnold himself through his book. And I thank him for his effort to write this book.Wish, he could make a DVD of all traning ways that he has menitioned in this book too.Ta Seyed M A Mearaji"
5,magnificant book,This book is a must for anyone from a beginner on up to an experienced body builder. I truly recomend this book to those who want to become a healthier person physically and mentally. Learn from the best Arnold Schwartszeneger. I have really been inpressed by the results I have noticed in my body's size and mass.
3,Aptly titled as an Encyclopedia and not as a Fitness Manual,"The New Encyclopedia of Modern Building is an interesting book, as it is not exactly a fitness guide or manual. It does contain many exercises however anyone who routinely weight trains and lifts probably already knows all of the exercises in the book. This is really for students and fans of bodybuilding, the sections on bodybuilding's history are extensive as is the section on posing for competitions. This is not an exercise book for those looking to learn about new workout plans or exercises. This is not for people looking to start learning about weight training, the exercises are not described in depth and the pictures are not all that helpful (most are of famous bodybuilders, often with poor form) and what surprised me the most is that there are only a few workout plans in the whole book. The New Encyclopedia will be thoroughly enjoyed by fans of the sport of bodybuilding."
5,The Bible,"The rest of the name on this book is not nessecary, it truely is The Bodybuilding Bible. I've used Bodybuilding.com for 6 months, and I have had better resuits in the past 2 months just using this book than I have had ever. Great book, but it."
4,Excellent Stuff,This is an excellent book which leaves no stone unturned in relation to bodybuilding. Hardly surprising as its by the greatest bodybuilder of all time. Like one of the other reviewers however I would also was a little surprised by the 6 days a week somtimes both morning and evening training programme. As a fitness instructor I wouldnt have recomended this although Ive never been Mr Universe. The exercises themselves are very well explained and there are plenty of them which is useful to people who do any sort of weight training. The pictures are superb and there are many interesting tips with regard to different elements of fitness.This book is well worth the money so if you are thinking of buying it think no more..
4,Bodybuilding,This Book is very well written and should be a must for any bodybuilders aspiring to potentially becoming recognized in Bodybuilding. Thank You Arnold for being an inspiration to so many people. Raymond Maher
2,"intersting but out-dated,for only drug user","It describes many bodypart traning exercises and contains history of bodybuilding that is intersting. But a great deal of information of the books is outdated and not based on scientific researchs and the exercise program is not suitable for normal health people but only for steroid drug users .Some exercises is easy to cause injury to tendon,ligament and joints.The book is no written in organised manner. I recommend customers not to follow the exercise program and some exercises such as shoulder press behind neck.This is only for reference. For bodybuilding and strength traing, I recommend the books titled A complete guide to strength training and A practical approach to strength traning."
2,Waste of money,"All pictures are great except for the exercises. They are too old fashioned and dangerous., But there are some excercises that are safe. (Doing the ""behind the neck press and pulldowns""??!?-- Gosh!! I'm a personal trainner and I won't let my clients suffer from shoulder problems doing behind the neck press and behind the neck pulldowns.) So, think twice before buying this book. And I think Arnold is a big liar telling people that HE didn't use steroids, He himself used it to get big. Who you trying to fool Arnold??? ARE You clean Arnold???"
1,Do movies instead,"Schwarzenegger was the best and most dominant bodybuilder inhistime. I am not trying to take anything away from hisaccomplishments. However, one thing he is not to the masses is an BBinstructor. His training routines and philosophies are flawed and attimes embarassing. It will take an exceptional, genetically giftedperson ... to acheive such a significant build following this book,and there certainly exists a much better means of doing so.The onlymerit I find for the book is the comprehensive list of exercises (mostwhich are unnecessary, but I believe you should be at least aware of)and a brief history of who's who in the BB world (if you are into thatsort of thing).... This will at least point you in the rightdirection. ""You wouldn't ask a race horse on how hetrains."" Arthur Jones"
1,not exactly good,"The day i bought this book i read it for about ten minutes and then went and got a refund from the shop where i bought it from. I realised that it was just for people on steroids so what good was that to me. Being such a legend and icon to so many people around the world arnie didn't even have the sence to consider us naturals, how can he say to train six times a week and a muscle part more than once a week when we all know that it is the wrong way to go. I reccomend a book by Zef Eizenberg called ""Natural Training That Works"" he is very high up in the company ""Maximuscle"" who are the leading suppliment company over here in England."
4,"Arnold isn't a scientist, he's an EXPERT","This is a very good book which teaches the basics of weight lifting as well as advanced bodybuilding. Someone above talked about how Arnold was jacked up on steroids and isn't a scientist and how he only was huge because bodybuilding was his life. First of all, back in Arnold's day most serious and competetive bodybuilders took steroids because they didn't know how serious the side effects were. However, when the side effects were discovered Arnold stopped using and became one of the most adament people against steroid use. Secondly, if you're a professional bodybuilder, bodybuilding is your life. Finally, nobody can be completely sure about anything in weightlifting, but I would much rather listen to the greatest bodybuilder (who's training techniques have won him many titles)than some scientific research."
2,"Interesting, but outdated","Interesting insight into the world of bodybuilding and contest strategies by the master himself. However, some of the exercises and training principles presented are DOWNRIGHT WRONG. I am an exercise physiologist and these programs would only work for someone on large amounts of steroids."
5,Perfect!,This book arrived just in time for Christmas in excellent condition. The person receiving the gift was completely satisfied as I was!
4,The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding,I have not received this book to date. Please advise when I can expect to receive it!
5,Don't hesitate to purchase this book! I bought it twice!,"I had bought this book for my 18 year old son that is very health concious and is into weight lifting. From the time I got it, he read it in every night and has shown me a lot of information in it as well. My son's friend saw it and started reading on it every time he was over and he stated ""This is my new favorite book"". So I ended up buying another one for him for his birthday! They both are always looking things up in it and taking it when they go to work out. Two thumbs up!"
5,Exactly What We Wanted,"We rented this book from the library a few times, then finally just decided to buy it. Excellent reference book for serious bodybuilders."
4,All bodybuild fanatic should own it...,It's really worth for value you invested especially for all bodybuild fanatics though it's been reviewed years ago but the opinion and technic still valid...
1,"Unless you have Ahhnold's genetics - DON""T BUY THIS BOOK",The training techniques promoted in this book are training suicide for most of the population. If you are interested in real results look at books by Stuart McRobert and Brooks Kubrik.
1,The worst thing ever hapened to my live!!,"Really, if you don't take steroids as arnold did, do you think that you could train six times a week (sometimes even with a two times a day split) without overtraining?? I was one of the stupids who thought that I could, and the result was that a did not gain even 1 grm. I spend three years of my live trining this way until I realized that I was overtraining. I hate arnold since then!!! If you realy want to grow naturally, spend your many on Beyond Brown or Heavy Duty. Any coments feel free to e-mail me at derek_farren@hotmail.com"
4,Book Quality.,"The product is OK, However Books should be protected by a film as well as the corners like in a painting to keep the corners in good condition. This is the diference between getting a book and getting a book in perfect condition.Anyway, thank you very much for your service.Diego Marco."
5,Best Book Ever!,"I've read this book and it's no less than what it is called, an encyclopedia of bodybuilding. The book teaches you everything you need to know and I mean EVERYTHING! I strongly erge everyone to buy this book."
5,Change of my life,"This book has literally changed my life. I started reading and skimming through it about 6 months ago. After I got a very good understanding of just what I needed to do to get in the best shape of my life it was easy from there. Arnold covers EVERYTHING that you need to eat, work out with and do in order to get where you want to be. I would reccomend it to everyone."
4,A great start for the novice.,"This book is an excellent reference manuel. The lifts are described in detail and illustrated. The book shows a variety of lifts for the same muscle group so that a person will have a variety of options. THis book is for bodybuilding though, it is not a reference book football programs, powerlifting programs or anything of the sort. This book is simply a great research tool to help vary your lifting program and outlines a variety of programs."
5,Arnolds book is great .,This book has been around for decades but is still a great deal of info the the weight lifter or just to get back into shape. Thanks
5,A book I would recommend,I would recommend this book for anyone interested in bettering their health or the way they look. It's an easy read and it provides the basic fundamentals of how to get the best out of your workouts.
5,"Governor of Bodybuilding (oh yeah, California too)","I've been training for over 10 years, through sports (middle, high school and college football) and to win two titles (Mr. USC 2002 bodybuilding competition overall winner and the USC 2001 Bench Press meet Heavy Weight winner.Even with this much experienc behind me, I still read through the Arnold Schwarzenegger Encycolpedia regularly to pick up new tips. It's laid out so well that someone who's never seen a gym could understand the basic by reading the first few chapters of this book. Also, the book goes in-depth enough that a seasoned lifter like myself can learn from it. I keep this and the original Arnold Encyclopedia (the yellow paper back version) around my personal training gym for quick motivation flipping through the awesome pictures or to re-study advanced techniques for stubborn bodyparts. Highly recommended."
2,"Interesting, outdated, will lead many down the wrong path","While the whole of the Arnold mythology is an interesting subject, as a training reference this book is questionable. The more I learn about lifting, the less I like this book. Arnold's success came from fabulous genetics, hard work, supreme self-confidence, steroids, and the behind-the-scenes assistance of Joe Weider. It wasn't from the two-hour workouts and ""sculpting"" exercises found in the first edition of this book. Some of the exercise advice he gives out - and just about anyone else ever associated with Joe Weider - has misled the entire community of body building wanna-bees for a generation."
2,Cartoon guide to bodybuilding,A book packed with routines that would stun a bull gorilla. No-one who is not taking phenomenal amounts of anabolic drugs will gain a scrap of muscle from the training advice presented here. Read anything by Stuart Macrobert if you want sensible training advice. IF you just want to drool over lots of pictures of Arnold - get this book.
2,Don't use it as training advice!,"This is a beautifully made book with tons of high quality pictures. It containsa lot of information on the bodybuilding world and its history and it is amonument to the dedication and success of Arnold Schwarzenegger.You can use this book for motivation or for a glimpse inside the world ofcompetitive bodybuilding, but don't use it as training advice! The trainingprograms in this book are very unlikely to work for anyone who is not agenetic phenonemon like Arnold. (You might be, but don't count on it!)I do not regret ordering this book, but as a book on training I wouldrecommend to everyone the great ""Beyond Brawn"" by Stuart McRobert."
4,Defitnely a good book,"Its a good book overall, but I expected more coming from Arnold himself. The whole idea should it have been to teach you how to become a good body builder. Give a man a fish an he will eat that night, teach the man how to fish and he will eat evey night!!!!"
4,Arnold could have done better,"Contrary to the other reviews I have read, you don't have to be doping yourself to use the information in this book. However you must insure that your training nutrition is flawless. It's a shame that the book doesn't go deeply into the idea of using legal supplements to help the bodybuilder be successfull. I think you have to start by reading a beginners guide to bodybuilding before jumping on this book. Without the proper foundations, most readers will see the exercises as impossible and therefore come to the conclusion that they need to use steroids to succeed. Overall a good book though, but not for beginners."
3,Buy it if you don't have the first one!,"Definetely not worth the $ if you have the first edition. The info is outdated and will lead to serious overtraining(unless you use anabolics). The pics are great, however, and so are the history of BB chapters."
4,This book is so thick you could knock someone out with it,"Arnold has covered the body building history and how to start training for competition. If your like me though, I bought this book for weight-training insights, pure and simple. And of course, the book delivers. Arnold has a great workout schedule and exercises that anyone novice or expert can use to their benefit. This book is full of information. Enjoy."
4,Owned the original,"Great book for learning about not just muscle building but lifting weights for strength, fitness or muscle.The individual exercises and the sample workout routines are very helpful when getting started or even back to your old routine."
3,ok,Got this for my husband. He seems to like it has been reading on them looking for tips while he is working out. Bought used and is in great shape!
4,Must get,This a must have book if you are interested in your health or want to start bodybuilding or just want to know more about how to get bigger. Its very in depth from your workout to how you should eat for your body type and its a good book to just read from time to time.
5,AWESOME!!,"I've been bodybuilding for almost 2 and a half years and this book always keeps me motivated and educated. Arnold really did a good job with this book, although the nutrition section is a little outdated. This book has cool pictures and even a Hall of Fame section. It's an all-around good book, from beginning to advanced."
5,One of the more complete books in bodybuilding,"I used to have the older version of this book but bought the newer one. Although you see a lot of pictures of bodybuilders posing which I think is sometimes irrelevant to the exercises given in this book, it manages to inspire you to pump more iron even though I am not aspiring to be as big as they are."
4,"Concise, specific, and detailed","Besides being written by Arnold, this book is a very good reference. It has many of the top exercises used to gain mass and define the muscles. It has been a very valuable reference for my workouts. His workouts are very specific and I didnt find the format of his workouts to be good for me, However the exercises he includes are incredible, I use a good portion of them in my routine and the pictures of the bodybuilders that are best at the exercises show how really to do them. Also there is a good reference section for the actual art of posing and competitive training as well as a brief bio of the sport, Arnold and many of his idols. Must have desk reference but not the end all of weighlifting books."
4,A good refrence.,"This book is good in that it gives a variety of exercises for all the muscle groups. However, different plans work for different people. Therefore, one must sift through this book to find the exercises that will work best. This book does contain a lot of information. This makes it easy for a beginner to get lost and not know where to start."
3,Slightly Dated,"I thought the new and revised version of the encyclopedia would have different training, diet and supplementation recommendations with up to date information on the science behind some of the newer techniques and ideas. However, the only thing new in the revised edition is the inclusion of a new preface.All in all, the book is pretty good for a beginner. Arnold's training routines are pretty outrageous and not for the average person. Some of the supplement recommendations I disagree with also. I think you could easily find most of this information online for free, but it does have some good information on the history of bodybuilding, as well as lots of good pictures and descriptions of specific excercises."
4,overall great,The edge is abit scratch. Overall is good. Quality paper. Packing is almost perfect. Brand new book. Colour is black and white
5,The Best Bodybuilding Book On The Planet.,"The ""New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding"" by Arnold Schwarzenegger is the best bodybuilding book on the planet, period. Unless, of course, you PREFER being a little girl who's afraid to lift weights. Then this book isn't for you."
4,Excellent reference,I have struggled with traing tips and varying my routines. I have found everything I need in this book. I'll be using these methods and ideas for a long time to come.
4,Bodybuilding Bible,"I bought this book because I wanted to get serious about working out. Arnold's Schwarzenegger book is one of the best book I read. It's easy to follow. It also shows illustrations of techniques that you might want to work on. It also describes nutritional value which is as important as working out. I'm getting a lot of useful information from the book. I'm glad I bought it.,"
3,interesting but not scientific,"The book describles the individual bodypart exercise in details.Very outstanding! It includes the chapter of bodybuilding history, which is quite interesting. But majority of the information in the book is not based on scientific and the suggested training programs is too intense. He suggested that advanced trainees train each bodypart 3 times per week .However, this is too intense and easily cause overtaining. For advanced trainees, training each bodypart twice or even once per week is enough to stimulate maximum hypertrophy. Anyway, the part of individual bodypart exercise is so valuable that the book is still good reference in your own library. ...."
3,too much reading,its not direct. Basically you have to dissect knowledge here. you also need a dictionary for many words used. Just not for people who don't have the time to do all that reading.
3,Good Info on Exercises-Althoug Outdated,"If you're trying to find a book which shows a wide variety of exercises for each and every muscle group, this book is excellent: it shows proper execution and purpose of each exercise (although some of those purposes are mostly based on tradition and not on scientific data). The book also has plenty of information on nutrition, and the pictures are awesome. The big flaw on it is that the information on training frequency and volume of training seem to be from a bygone era: anyone trainig this much (specially natural trainees) are in for an overtrainig nightmare. Bottom line: buy it for recreational and inspirational purposes, and buy a good book (such as Charles Poliquin's, Steven Fleck's, etc.)for designing workouts."
5,excellent buy,I was thoroughly statisfied with expedient delivery and condition of this product. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a passion for fitness and wants to start a serious weight trainning program.
3,Depends on what you are looking for,"This is a well written book, but is not for everyone. It depends on what you are looking for. It's well worth the price if1) you are looking for a source of all possible exercises and how do them right.2) want to learn about this history about the sports, and some great champs from 50's/60's/70's. the book is full of inspirational photos.However the nutrition section is dated, not a whole lot of info on preventing injuries. The workout plan that Arnold outlines is simply insane. You need to rest each body part a week, and not 1-2 days as Arnold says. It would work if you are on steroids."
1,Counter-productive for the Average Lifter,"This book is about 25 years out of date with both scientific results and empirical observations on what works for the average, non-steroid popping individual.This was my bible for the first 5 years of my weight-lifting life, and it was the worst possible thing I could read. I trained as prescribed by Arnie and ate like a pig. I made only nominal strength and weight gains because like 95% of the population, I'm a 'hard-gainer', which means that unless I take steroids, lifting more than 3x a week is overtraining. Recovery time is at least one week per muscle group for the average person. According to Arnold's schedule, it's more like 24-48 hours.A year ago I switched to a much less physically and mentally taxing 2-3x a week plan typical of HIT (high-intensity training), and have seen gains of 2.5lbs/week on bench and 5 lbs/week on squat.Arnold's book is average for tips on form. Its training regimen is only for Mr. Steroids."
1,NO NO NO,"This book has done immeasurable harm. Anyone who follows routines even remotely close to those that are in this book will just end up, overtrained and frustrated.Please people get this- arnold had amazing genteics, arnold did huge quantities of drugs and so does everyone else pictured in this book, arnold had unlimited time to train and recover BUT you do NOT.You can build a tertific physique if you would follow sensible routines buy real world authors- Mark rippetoe, stuart mcrobert, mike mentzer, ellinton darden. Please heed this advice. I have nothing to gain by bashing this book. It is just not helpful for well intentioned people looking to build their body naturally. Please look elsewhere"
4,Watch Sizing....,"I bought the medium/large size. Because this item is a one piece thing, it is a little tight through my torso area. I guess I have a longer body than the model that they built it for.I would also say that it cuts very low in the front, So if you don't mind your bra showing then you will have no problems. (Side note: Fire engine Red works well with the outfit.)All in all thou it is built well for the material that it is made of. I have gotten some good use out of it. All the boys at the bar that I work at think it is a great idea for the nights that I bartend in October.Happy Shopping all."
1,not much of a microphone...,"I could hear people fine, but no one could hear me. The ear thingie is really uncomfortable/awkward if you wear glasses. Sending it in for a refund!"
2,It's decent....I guess...,"I bought this for the price (less than $25) and while I think it IS a little awkward fitting in the ear, it's not THAT bad of a headset. However, after only a month of having it, something has happened to the speaker part to where I can only faintly hear the other party. For that, I can't recommend it. If everything else on the market was above $50, then it would be a decent deal, but there are at least 3-4 other brands around (probably more) at the same price level."
3,"It's fine, but it's not Fake","This series is perfectly fine, but just that: nothing out of the ordinary, either good or bad. I don't have the original so I can't tell if it's the translation or the writing, but the text is awkward and the art is in that feathery style so beloved of a certain number of mangaka. Anyway, Yellow is worth buying for an afternoon's entertainment but if you want something with more staying power, check out the classic series this one ripp--uh, was inspired by: Matoh Sanami's FAKE."
4,Excellent detailed JDBC book,"This book is made for the J2EE enthusiast. It has plenty of good code exampled for both Oracle and MySql connections. I would recommend this to J2EE users only. I would not recommend this to any new users though. It is written in such away that if you have no basic JDBC knowledge, it would be a confusing experience. Overall I found this book very helpful."
1,Vinyl Binder,Organizing my office and in need of some professional binders...this binders three rings were bent and would not close. I was unable to us this and unfortunately had to return it. To bad the vinyl was very shiny and nice.
3,Nice pictures --- at least one significant factual error,"I enjoy this serious, because often the illustrations are well chosen.However, on page 26 the book states that pi is equal to 22/7. Since pi is an _irrational_ number it can not be expressed as the ratio of any two integers. Pi is only approximately equal to 22/7. This is an extremely important mathematical fact, so the error is a disconcerting one."
4,Better than I expected,"With Phil Collin's production and drumming , Frida , a woman who's vocals are instantly recognized for Abba, actually comes alive with her own sound...I thought 4 songs were notable.. Of course ""Something's Going On"" is Awesome..but I really was surprised by ""Here We'll Stay"" which I remembered once I heard it, but had completely forgotten...""I See Red"" is strong and ""I Got Something"" is also very good... I suggest this as a ""Buy"""
2,Tangled Hair,I did not like this doll. Her hair quickly got wrapped around her crown and made her unable to turn. Her stiff leg is either up or down and eventually broke off. As long as no one wants to actually play with the doll it's great. Otherwise save your money and find something else to buy.
4,A lovely book,"This book is a great start for medieval cooking made easy. The recipes are easy to use and well formatted, and it's very friendly. I highly recommend it!"
2,WEIGHT CONFUSION,"The add originally posted did not have the weight of the dog food in the add. In fact, under product review, it claims its weight is 41#s. When I received the package of only 8#s, I was disappointed with the size vs the cost. I am a new amazon food consumer. I will continue to order but will be more wary of quantity vs cost especially with these types of items. The product is great and I did receive it in a timely manner, aside from a delay due to weather storm in the Southeastern Mountains."
5,Great Gift for the Kids!,"My five year old got this for his birthday and my eight, seven, and two year old love it as well. After opening the package, I immediately took the top off the motor piece and removed the small plastic tab that caused the terrible clicking sound everyone mentions. It took about three minutes and was an easy fix.Pieces are large and chunky and snap together easily. Great toy for the price!"
4,Great toy,"We chose this for our 4 1/2 year-old son for Christmas because we wanted to give him a toy that was different than the typical toys at the big chain stores. We love that there are so many different ways to put this toy together. My biggest complaint about it is that sometimes the pieces come apart as he plays with them (if he hasn't put them together all the way.) He has a lower frustration thresh hold than some kids his age, so this often makes him upset. As he's getting better at it though, he's enjoying the toy more."
3,Just okay,"I love this toy in theory but neither of my children (ages 3 & 5) have gotten into it. It's very difficult for them to make something without adult supervision that will actually move. The connectors that allow things to move are sometimes awkwardly located and they can't build the design they want and get the parts to move correctly. This causes them to get frustrated quite easily. As a result, it gets little playtime. It might be good if your child is a tinkerer but, in general, not as great as you'd think."
4,"Easily falls apart, but tons of fun!","Our 3yo son is in love with these toys. After assembling the first 4 toys as instructed, he was making up his own combinations (helicopter race car, train plane, etc). He was sad about them falling apart so easily after zooming across the carpet only a few feet, but he's learned to be more gentle (something I'm having to constantly remind him of anyway : and goes to this toy as soon as we get home. So far, the noise hasn't been worse than other noisy toys, so we haven't attempted to remove the noise maker, but glad to have the tips from other users!"
5,My 4-year old loves it!,"We bought this toy as a present for my son's 4-year old birthday. He unwrapped the present and was immediately interested based on the packaging. It took him about a day to learn how to make the different configurations. Since then, he has carried it around, changed the different configurations and slept with the thing. Truly one of the rare toys that has captivated his attention for a long period of time!A couple of notes:The ticking sound mentioned by others is a little loud and annoying. See the other posts for how to eliminate it. My wife and I just glued a piece of fabric inside the toy to soften the ticking sound.Some reviews said the toy is a little flimsy and would fall apart at the lightest touch. We haven't found their reviews to be the case. Although, a couple of parts don't make the most snug fit, they do hold together as are son is pushing it around on the carpet or flying it around through the air."
3,Tomy Constructables,I bought this toy for a present for my grandsons after one of them played with it at a friend's house. He is 5 and played with it for a long time and enjoyed every minute. I am giving it to one for his birthday and the other one is a Christmas gift.
5,Great Toy!,"My 2 1/2 yr old and I love this toy. As he is growing, he is getting better at attaching the pieces. We build different things and play with this 4 or 5 times a week. The only downside was the annoying clicking noise - but thanks to other reviewers I was able to remove the piece that causes the noise. Now this toy is perfect!"
2,take apart toy,"this toy was for my 3yo son, he loves to take things apart and put them back together and thats exactly what this toy offers. he can make different vehicles by moving and changing parts around and it even has a motor to make some of the parts move. unfortunatly some of the parts fit very loose and fall out easily, the motor is not very strong so the cars do not move much on our carpet, and the motor is very loud with a headache inducing ""clicking noise"". our box didnt come with any instructions so we had to follow the pictures on the outside of the box, not that that is hard to do, but we had broken down the box once it was opened so we had to dig it back out. overall my son enjoyed it on christmas, but now he doesnt play with it because it was just frustrating."
2,Noisy and falls apart easily,"I wanted to love this toy. My four year old son received it as a birthday gift 4 months ago. He does want to play with it, and enjoys the creative assembly process. But after he builds something and tries to push it around or play with it, even gently, the core pieces fall apart, and he gets very frustrated. Also, the noise from the motor is loud and obnoxious. I think they could significantly improve these two problems and make this a big hit, but its going in the trash."
3,Graciously giving it a 3,"The other lower ratings had the same complaints. I just thought that it wasn't quite a 2. I actually thought we got a faulty set because of the clicking and loud sound the motor makes. What happens at the executive level of these companies that test and review products? Who said ""Yes, the parents won't mind one more LOUD sound in their house."" And yes, once it's made it can fall apart easily if they try to push it around. It falls apart less on my 4 and half year old than my 3 year old. They must have had the most mellow, passive children testing this set so that they never fell apart. Thus, giving the ""stamp of approval"" to put it into mass production. The concept is really good and both my 3 and 4 year old boys enjoy using it."
3,"Great idea, but it's too noisy and falls apart easily","Our 3-year-old son loves this toy, but it keeps falling apart. Also, the pieces are hard to put together. And the noise is just awful! I was very disappointed, but at least my son still ilkes it."
4,Tomy Constructables,"I purchased this toy for my 4 year-old grandson for Christmas. I have not opened the box yet. However, I am sure he will love it."
2,Lackluster performance,I recently heard this quintet performed by a chamber group and it was great. The disc is dull. I was disappointed.
4,Great investment,"I'd say the next investment to make is to strengthen your arms. I use this with an XHA1 and it gets pretty heavy. Thank goodness for the monopod mode. Anything short of buying a vest with a double articulated arm to handle this thing will require some practice and stamina to get the dreamy steady shots some of you may be looking for. I'd say the only thing I'd want more is a quick release interface for the camera. Re-balancing this thing is not a quick task. Other than that, it's been a joy to use."
3,Monopod,I bought this product thinking it would be a good stablizer that i could use while walking with my camera. I use it now for a monopod becuase it doesn't stablize very well when i would walk.
2,Cannot Replace Battery,"After reading a number of reviews, I could not find a definitive answer to the battery replacement question. So, I called Black & Decker and one of their local service centers. You cannot replace the battery alone. You must replace the battery and motor as a single unit. The cost of this combined replacement item is more than the vacuum itself. As a result, this handheld vac is basically a throw-away once the battery dies. Not sure why Black & Decker would sell such a bad design. It is not good for their customers nor for the environment."
5,Best VAC ever!!,Bought this for my daughter. Out of the box she loved it. Charging lasts a lot longer than other hand held vacs we have owned and it picks up better.
5,Powerful suction!,I bought this because it was rated as powerful as the Dyson handheld for a lot less money. I'm very satisfied. It picks up all kinds of objects from glass to sawdust without a problem.
2,disappointing performance,very small nozzle...suction power not impressive...somewhat heavy...I can't think of one realistic use...I originally bought it for easier use to vaccum my car...I ended up not using it at all.
1,powerful unit.,It's more powerful than the one we have before.Since I have it not very long that i do notb know how long it will be last.So far so good.
4,"Handy, and fun to use","The design is unique, and so is the functional pivoting nose, which can even be extended. I like the turbo power option, too. It's a little messy emptying the dirt compartment, and a nuisance washing the filter; but overall I recommend this useful household gadget. It's the best handheld vac I have ever owned."
5,Awesome product,"I love this vacuum. It folds up to be compact and fits right in a recharging unit. So it is ready whenever you need it. Additionally, it has a filter system that you simply open and empty. You do not need any vacuum bags. I use it every day! You will love it as much as I do."
5,Finally performance,"I am hopeful that Black and Decker has finally produced a hand held vacuum that will last a reasonable time. This unit has very good suction and appears well built. It has an extendable nozzle for getting into tight places, and the filter assembly is easily removed without getting dirt everywhere! You can even see the dirt buildup thru the clear case section. The pivoting nozzle will be useful for getting to higher places than just the floor. The introduction of an 18 volt unit should prove to be the answer to a really powerful unit. The vacuum is heavier than what we are used to, but certainly not cumbersome. If weight is a penalty for performance, then so be it. I am hoping that Black and Decker will produce a unit with a Nickel Metal Hydride battery some day to extend the life of these vacuums. So far, we are happy with this one."
2,Black & Decker 18 volt cordless handheld vacuum,I am 67 years old and find this vacuum too heavy for me to handle as I have arthritis in both of my wrists. I have to hold it with both hands and this is also hard to do. I also don't think it picks up dog hair like I wanted it for. I wanted it to mainly clean my car since I bring my dog with me. In fact if it is not too late I am going to be looking into returning this product.
4,Much better than a Dustbuster,This cordless vacumn is great. It is powerful and can be used for quick jobs around the house as well as the car. Battery life is decent- about 15 minutes. Only drawback is that there is no way to tell how much charge is left.
3,Hoping it would be better,"We have used a B&D Dustbuster for years and it has been great. However, this product has been a bit of a letdown. First of all the nozzle is MUCH smaller than other Dustbusters, as a result a lot of ""normal"" stuff we would vac up don't fit, or fit at the end and get stuck in the nozzle -- this happens quite a bit. The other problem is if you accidentally suck up any thing wet it makes the inside canister a horrific mess that not only can be seen, but has to be cleaned and dried before you can use it again. We will most likely keep using it for really small particles, but will probably order another one for normal sized DustBuster messes."
2,High volt; low battery & filter,"The pivoting nose cordless vacuum is cleverly designed. The nose swivels to reach difficult spots. It folds up neatly for charging and storage. Unfortunately, it takes 16 hours to charge! Because the filter traps so much dirt and stuff (that's good), it rapidly loses vacuuming power and burns through the battery power quickly (those are bad). If I had to buy it again, I would not."
4,Powerful little sucker,"This little guy has plenty of power, is priced right, has good battery capacity and does an overall nice job. If I could add one thing, the accessories it comes with (attachments) are kind of lame but otherwise you will be very pleased with this compared to $150 for a dyson which doesn't perform as well."
2,Busted Dust Buster,i purchased two of these and both are going back. The suction is great but all items sucked up get stuck in the nose and nothing goes into the dispenser. I spend my whole time picking out the clog. Quite noisy too.
2,"Looks great, but go with platinum.","not worth the purchase. Although it looked like a great idea, the nose was to small for chips and other items around by kids. The catch bay was also to small. In addition it seems that all B&D vacs have a poor system to close the main section off from the intake. Its a small rubber valve system usually based on a flimsy plug and hole system. This is always the first thing to break during cleaning out inside main section. Go with the platinum if you need something sturdy."
4,Works great for the price,"Works great for the price!pros: good suction, always charged and readycons: very loud, clogs a bit too much"
4,Suction is good; spacesaver; noisy; bulky;,The volt ensures that you get good suction. I just wish it wasn't as loud and heavy to carry around.
5,Best Handheld Vacuum.,THe Black and Decker 18 volt Pivoting-Nose Cordless Handheld Vacuum is the only handheld vacuum that i have used and it has worked perfect. It picks up anything and everything. The vacuum has more power then our normal vacuums. The only problem i have had with it is that it is that it picks up to good. I would Recommend the this vacuum to anyone.
5,Outstanding hand vac...,"Pros:Everything about how the product works; great suction, easy to clean up (the side door to empty & easily removed filter), good battery life, narrow but not small nozzle to get into tight places, easy handling (power switches, nozzle positioner switch), good ""accessories"".Cons:Pricey, kinda large and a little heavy (not a problem for me, but could be for some), the base seems to be a little bit of an afterthought for such a well thought out hand vac.All in all, this thing is awesome and I'm seriously considering buying another in spite of the price (my wife and I are always needing it at the same time). But, hey, you get what you pay for in this terrific hand vac."
2,Needs further engineering,"This product needs more work. It has great power but if you turn it off and point the tip down, the stuff you sucked up will fall down through the tube onto the floor...especially heavy stuff like cat litter and guineau pig bedding. This could easily have been fixed with a flap over the tube. On the positive side, it has a great recharger interface...snug and simple. I hope version 2 will be better. Go for one of Black and Decker's other offerings until they make some improvements."
4,"Great price, fast shipping on this highly rated product! But heavy","Great price, fast shipping on this highly rated product! Be aware it's a little heavy, but that is necessary for the power. Not a good idea for your elderly mom. I am asking my daughter to go aruond 3 times a week and get *her* dog's fur clouds.....!!!"
4,Black & Decker 18volt Pivoting Nose Cordless Hand Vac,"Well designed and thought out. Very powerful, easy to clean. I don't like the accessory holder on the stand, will be easy to lose the brush.The battery starts to lose a charge after about 4 minutes but is designed for quick clean up not vacuming a whole room which it does well."
5,GREAT product,This is exactly what I've been looking for. I wanted a hand vac to get things for when it is small and I do not have time or feel like taking the sweeper out. I love that the charger can just stand on my counter and I am not required to put holes in my walls if I do not want to. I cannot wait to use it in my car!
3,Works well but a little noisy,"I've used the product for several months now & I'm happy with it. It works well, has good suction, and the size makes it very convenient to use for quick clean ups. Only negative is that it's pretty loud. Highly recommended.Product update May 2010:Got rid of vacuum after a few years of service. Battery would only hold about 3 minutes of charge & vacuum's noise grew increasingly louder until I could no longer tolerate it (nor could my family when they were around). Also, I think a flap at the base of the nozzle broke off so debris could not be contained after it got sucked up so I had to empty the vacuum after each use. It became very inconvenient to use but it was good while it lasted. I would not purchase another one."
5,This thing SUCKS!!!,"But that is why you would buy it. Great power (cleaned up spilled BBs from my son's gun) and battery life. I love it.The nozzle is a bit smaller than I might prefer, requiring more passes to clean up spills."
3,Good Vac,"Although the suction is good when you start using the vac, it doesn't seem to last very long."
5,Good Vacuum,"This is a very nice little vacuum.I like it a lot, but it's loud and the nose has to be very extended - not just tilted half way - or the exhaust air blows the dust around before the vacuum can get it.I'd buy another."
4,Subwoofers,"Good subwoofers for the money. They do not the the low beats as well, but if you are looking for subs that hit hard and quick, you have found them."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!,"...Rarely is there a necessity for this, but unfortunately this book is nothing more than extensive marketing hype for very expensive and dubious products that are made available for sale at the end of the book. This work steps far beyond the boundaries of reputable journalism and in my opinion should not be allowed to grace the shelves of bona fide booksellers.There is some interesting background information presented about Viktor Schauberger, a pioneer in water research, but this too is unfortunately used to further the marketing ploy."
2,Not at all what I thought it would be,"I was disappointed to see this particular book was just an advertisement. It was helpful to read this particular review:""The book has been illegaly changed, September 7, 1999Reviewer: A readerI am a friend of the author (Dr. Hans Kronberger)and I contributed to the book.Thus I was very astonished that the book has been changed without permission.This is neither the wish of the authors, nor can it be the wish of Amazon.I can offer you a copy of the letter chancelling contract. (Uranus the original publisher chancelled the contract with Wishiland publishing)The original translation can be bought from Uranus or from amazon.de (Germany)Georg Huber"""

1,Cheap product,"I received this as a gift from my husband, which was very thoughtful and a wonderful idea, but from the plastic bottles to the watered-down contents inside, I am totally unimpressed with this gift package. This item is WAY, WAY overpriced. You'd be better off going to CVS and purchasing a $10 gift basket from them."
5,Well done!,Good work and a refreshing perspective for long-time LBH historians. A great source book for artists. Take note! A great value for the price as well.
5,A marvelous work,This is a great publication.I have always loved books like this that show historical images then and now.I highly reccomend this book to anybody with an interest in history.
3,"Performed well for a while, then went downhill","I paid way less at retail than what amazon is charging for this fan, which is not the norm for most of what amazon sells. I bought it originally about 3.5 years ago to keep me cool at my desk, since I work around numerous computers that heat the place up. At that time, I only ever had it on the lowest setting, but as soon as i began using it regularly at home in our bedroom on anything higher than the lowest speed, the fan began a downward spiral. A rattling noise developed for the past 6 months, and finally the fan completely disintegrated and now sounds more like a lawnmower. At the price I paid, it was worth it for the 3.5 years of use, but this thirty dollar price tag here is way more than it's worth in my opinion. I just threw it in the trash after concluding that it wasn't fixable, or worth my time to even try to fix."
1,Turns itself off,"I put the fan on my table, plugged it into a power strip and went to sleep--when I woke up it wasn't running. I turned it on again and within 20 minutes it had stopped. I tried again, and again, same result. Customer service advised: ""Try plugging it into a different outlet in different rooms [sic]"". Sure enough, in a room where I don't want it, plugged into a wall socket I need for the TV, it works fine. Is this supposed to be a fix? They say if this doesn't work I can send it back postage paid because ""We would like to exam this unit."" I think the Wind Tower's circuitry is junk and their customer service needs to brush up on written English."
2,very loud,"I bought this item at Home Depot without reading any reviews.This little fan is a great size and puts out fair cooling breeze.That is why it gets 2 stars.PROBLEM IS LOUDNESS.Since you need to be close to it to get any benefit the loudness is especially irritating.I thought LASKO would be OK because Hammacher Schlemmer gives the windtower version a ""BEST"" review.Now reading windtower reviews on AMAZON I find many people have issues with this brand.I am still looking for an efficient and QUIET room fan."
3,It could be better,"We've owned ours for about 3 weeks and when we first got it, it was smooth and quiet; but now it makes a kind of grinding noise when it oscilates in one direction. So I say it's ok."
3,Nice but big and cracked,"Received unit and it worked right out of the box. However, I should have paid a little more attention to the size listing. This unit almost matches the size of a 2-liter soda bottle. Also, the shipping was packed poorly. The top half has a severe crack where it looks like it was dropped. Since it still works ok, it wasn't worth the hassle or cost of having it shipped back. If you are looking for a ""thin"" unit to sit on your desk at work, you may want to look elsewhere."
4,WORKS WELL FOR ITS SIZE,We purchased this little fan for our kid's room. For it's size it works quite well. It puts out more airflow than I expected from a fan that is about 16 inches tall. It's nice how you can have it blowing two different directions at the same time.
2,Cute fan bad design,I bought this fan a year ago at a Walmart. When i took it out of the box i noticed a rattling sound. A piece of the fan had broken off and was stuck in the fan. The breeze was not very good and when i laid down at night i could not feel it. too tall for nightstand i guess. It also gets clogged with dust. I try to clean some of it by using a q-tip but it didn't help much. It broke today and is now useless. Not gonna buy that again.
1,Garbage,"If the box doesn't slice your hands open, you're lucky. The fan went back next day. Loud grinding vibrations on low.The lights on the buttons are annoying.The split vents are a great feature if the fan would work unobtrusively.Made in China"
2,Stop Working,"I love this fan until after less than 2 months, it won't come on. I'm do not know what to do."
1,"Looks cute, bad quality!","I bought this fan around Christmas because it looked cute and it's a good brand, but it didn't oscillate properly (I didn't buy through amazon). I exchanged it for another one, which didn't oscillate at all. In spite of those experiences, I still tried a third fan, which I got today. This one oscillates well, but it doesn't blow at all!!!! Unbelievable. It'll be returned to the store immediately. If there were the option of giving this product zero stars, I would. I do NOT recommend this Lasko fan."
1,Poor quality and noisy,"Bought this fan to help with cooling a kitchen work area. It has a nice small footprint (handy when placed on a counter), and is short enough to be unobtrusive. The problem is that the fan blower alone is somewhat noisy on anything but the lowest setting. Add to that an oscillation system that began making noise about 30 days after purchase. The thing now clicks, grumbles, and rumbles as it slowly churns its way through each oscillation pass. It's extremely loud and intrusive. I'd send it back to Lasko, but the warranty service charges and shipping make that a money-losing proposition.For now, I run it only as a non-oscillating fan, and am looking for a replacement. Your best bet: Don't Buy This Fan."
2,Fantasia,"I went through two of these in less than 2 weeks. The problem is in the oscillation system. It can start making a clicking noise while oscillating; and when you wake up the next morning; you find that your fan has stopped oscillating completely! The air output is ok, and it has 3 speeds/with a directional top vent. It looks cool, has lighted electronic push buttons on the front, that double as a night light. I paid $19.99 at Walmart; and tried two of them, but both failed at oscillating."
1,Poorly built,"I had this fan for about 6 months when a host of problems emerged. First it started making a loud ""cracking"" noise when it oscillated until if finally just stopped moving. Then the fan speeds became variable and intermittent. Sometimes low was low, sometimes it was high, sometimes it didn't sound like the fan blades were moving at all, just sitting there ""humming"". Same problem for the other speeds. I finally just tossed it in the trash. So here I am, looking for a new desk fan."
4,Good compact fan,This is a good option if your looking for something small and discrete. It is quiet and relatively powerful for such a small fan. Great buy.
2,LOUD!,"This fan is everything as advertised - and more. The oscillating feature is SO LOUD, it make this fan impractical for a bedroom. I would recommend this product - but only in its non-oscillating mode!"
2,Too loud to be useful. It's going back.,"I bought this fan thinking it would be quieter than a larger fan I've been using in my office. What a mistake. This is the loudest ""small"" fan I've ever heard. I'm giving it an extra star only because it works out of the box and looks nice. It's a shame too because it puts out the exact amount of air I want. I just don't think it should sound like a diesel truck parked outside my window."
1,Oscillation Noise,"I purchased two of these fans, and can not tolerate the crackle/grind noise they make when set to oscillate."
1,buttons do not work,"received fan and once the fan is turned on, the buttons dont work-cant change the speed and mus push a dozen times before i can turn it off. i would return but threw away box so i am stuck"
1,It's a love/hate thing...,"I just purchased my second fan of this style. I have had one for over five years and love it. It's insanely noisy on oscillating, but not bad stationary. However, the new one sounds like it has a piece of plastic hanging off of something inside. When I turn it on, it's so loud I think it's going to blow up. Going to take it back and get something different. I'd recommend based on the first one I owned (if you can live without oscillating), but no recommendation from the new one."
3,He's my husband,"It is a heartfelt story about a girl who turnes into adulthood and feels that her married life is in deep trouble. Although her husband have not taken her to bed yet, she is sure that he loves her and vows that she will force him to admit it."
3,"My intro to the sounds of tango - decent, not outstanding","I bought this CD (and the companion Volume 2 as part of a boxed set) because I knew absolutely nothing about tango music and wanted to listen and learn. All of the songs on these albums are older recordings from a wide range of tango performers from Argentina. I found the music to be decent, not outstanding. The recordings on these CDs didn't make me want to go out and buy every tango CD available, although I do listen to this CD on a fairly regular basis. Maybe I still don't `get it', but I thought that tango would be a little more romantic and emotional. I guess that I expected something a little more inspiring. This isn't the kind of music that you would use to woo a beautiful woman in my view! I still have a lot to learn about tango. A decent CD for the price in any case though."
4,Great book !!!,"I recommend this book for every one needs to broaden his ideas about theaters design, for its great examples and comperhensive drawings and text , only one thing u'll not find it's the basics of theater design . at last this is an accomplished work and i recommend it highly ..."
4,Good Product - Good Price,This is the best cart I found in its price group. I can fill it with groceries for my brother and pull it to the third floor of his building. Only problem is when you add a liner you can no longer utilize the hook/catch to secure the cart when folded up for storeage. Adding another catch would make this cart perfect.
2,Jumbo Folding Shopping Cart,"This shopping care is a better option than carrying a week's worth of groceries in the house by hand. The cart is big, allowing many items to be placed in it. It seems to be heavy duty enough.My main complaints are these: it does not steer easily; it is too heavy for a person with physical limitations to lift; the plastic sleeve on the handle slips more than it stays where it's needed; and it could use two pivoting wheels.I leave the cart at home because I cannot pick it up to put in the car. Then when I return home, I have to retrieve it from a closet. It is awkward to steer, whether empty or full. I would not buy another one for myself."
5,Shopping Cart,We purchased this cart to take groceries from the car up a short hill to our house. It works great. Love it.
2,Not so sturdy,"The first time we used it, the back wheel bar bent when it hit the side of the curb. I did read another review about the same thing and should have listened. It probably would hold up better if you do not put heavy objects in it, which defeats the purpose of having it for grocery shopping. I thought is was suppose to hold 75 lbs. Good thing we live close to the grocery store because we had to transfer the groceries back into the grocery cart in order to make it home.There also were no instructions on how to assembly it, but we figured it out."
4,old school shopping cart,"solid cart, perfect size for an older man who can afford wine but not his drugs. yea america!"
4,its nice,i rally like it but it is bent trying to fold it make a little bit hard but i get by with it thank
3,Design Flaws,The shopping cart is a great size but near the back wheels there is a metal loop coming from the cart making it impossible for the back wheels to rotate. I was able to fix this problem by taking the back wheels off and putting approx 8 washers on each side before I reattached the wheels on which gave the wheels just enough room to rotate.
1,Broke during 1st use,"I have to travel a few blocks to get to my local supermarket so I needed to purchase a shopping cart to make grocery shopping easier. However, this cart is not durable. I packed the cart full of groceries and it became difficult to maneuver. Along the way, one of the larger wheels popped off the cart and the rubber on one of the smaller tires came off. This occurred while I was crossing the street which made it impossible to pick up the pieces to fix the wheel. Unless you're moving loaves of bread, I would suggest getting a stabler cart."
2,jumbo folding cart,"I had ordered a another one first and it was great this was supposed to be the same It came in good time but was really shocked due to it being so different then the first one, This one had plastic weels, mine was rubber wheels and nice wheels where you were proud to take it out the one I got from you was poorly made when I feel it wont hold up as well am keeping it since i went through the trouble to put it together but am certainly not pleased with its apperance"
5,Shopping Cart,The shopping cart arrived in a very timely manner. I was a little surpr5ised at the promptness give this was the holiday season. The cart is very spacious and will hold a lot of groceries if this is the intended use. I also purchased the bag that inserts into the basket to protect the contents from weather and falling out. The cart came with an exploded view to illustrate assembly that was quite easy to follow. Assembly was very quick and quite simple. The wheels and axels were the only items that were not pre-assembled. The cart appears to be built sturdy enough to provide years of service. I would recommend this cart.
1,Buyer Beware !,"Buyer beware. Purchased this product from a marketplace seller named PERFECTBUYZ, avoid this seller, read the customer feedback by this very rude & non customer advocate as they do not stand up to Amazon.com's high quality customer satisfaction.Had several quality defects with this product to include missing components, poor quality and design.Amazon as usual has taken great care of me and made a expedited refund in this matter.Amazon.com as my experience with purchasing many many products online out shines all sellers I have dealt with. I have had many great experience's with other sellers but Amazon.com will go above and beyond the call of duty as they truly embrace customer satisfaction to the fullest, not just a fancy slogan as other may advertise."
3,excellent folding cart,"Jumbo Folding Shopping Cart - Black (Black) (41.75""h x 24""w x 21""d (cart size))I had one of these previously which I really enjoyed until I overloaded it. This seems to be an entirely acceptable product, though it seems a little more light weight than the other and the handle covers are not as good. All in all, this does exactly what I want it to do."
1,Review? Never received the product itself. Worst service!,"We ordered this product almost a moth ago and still have not received it. We were told that product will arrive in 7-10 business days. There is no communication whatsoever from either Amazon or the actual third party company which was suppose to mail this product. Dear readers, be careful while ordering this product. Amazon, please help."
2,"Payed too much, assembly was troublesome","After buying the item for $60, I discovered that CVS was selling them for $20. Assembly the item was troublesome, and item looked of poor quality. With that said its working fine right now."
3,DISAPPOINTED,I find this product to be disappointing and somewhat unstable. The first time I used the cart it toppled over taking me with it. Fortunately I was not seriously injured. After that I was really afraid to use it but had not choice. I learned if I am to have any stability with it I must slightly lift the wheels and pull it from behind. The good thing about it is it has a lot of room.
5,GREAT SHOES!,"MY DAUGHTER PLAYS CLUB SOCCER (AGE 12) SHE IS ONE OF THE FASTEST RUNNERS ON THE TEAM, ALSO PLAYS OFFENSE AND DEFENSE. SHE IS EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THESE SHOES! GREAT TRACTION, COMFY AND SHE LOVES THE COLOR!"
3,A bit young...,"for the high school students I teach, although it's perfect for elementary kids. The video quality was poor although the information is good. Penn & Teller are always good entertainment."
2,Nintendo DS Headset,"My daughter was very excited to get this as it is compatible with the Pokemon Diamond and Pearl DS Games. Infact, both of my daughters got one so they could play together. Although they look very cute wearing the headsets, they don't like to use them because they hear much better without them or with normal earphones. Additionally, my daughter said you can talk directly into the DS without the headset and it works better. Hope this helps."
4,Love it,"I love this headset, I am able to play a great game with a friend of mine over 3 states. It's cheaper than running up the phone. I think nintendo should make more games compatible with the headset."
4,Headphones for DS,The headphones are okay. We tried using it with Nintendogs and it works okay. I think the voice recognition is difficult for these games no matter what you use. It helped a little.
1,Nintendo DS Headset,I hate this headset. It doesnt fit right on my ear and the mic doesnt recognize my voice a lot
1,:(,I got this for my birthday. And I have an original nintendo ds and this headset has ruined my nintendo ds speakers! I've had to have it repaired by nintendo twice. Don't Buy if original DS owner!
2,Poor Design... use headphones and the on board mic instead.,"I purchased this when I still was using a DSi. Most official Nintendo devices and merchandise are fairly well made, however this is an exception. I'm assuming that regardless of ear size, shape or set, the design of this item is universally bad. It offers no variables to adjust to the contour of one's ear... the earpiece simply flips out on a hinge and clips on the ear by closing that hinge. To boot, although it is not large, it feels bulky and uncomfortable.The microphone works fairly well but offers no adjustment. You are better off using a set of headphones and speaking into the on board microphone than spending money on this shoddy piece of merchandise."
2,Poor quality with sound,dont buy it because it has poor sound and quality and not to mention the style. i can barley fit it in my ear.i think it would b better to get a regular pair of headphones.
5,Good assessory for the Nintendo DS,"I bought the headset to use with my DS while playing the game My French Coach. The headset is a touch large for my ear, but it does work very well. The microphone is moveable so the user will be able to use it on either ear. A good buy for any person who has a game that this device can be used."
3,An Intelligent Guide,"Although a previous review criticised this book for not helping with the shopping, there are those of us who can negotiate these things on our own, or who went to Estonia armed also with more touristy guides for those matters (such as the fine ""In Your Pocket"" series). The Bradt Guide to Estonia, however, is for those of us who wish to know more about the history, culture, and especially the natural history of a place before we travel, that we may arrive informed. Indeed, not many travel guides even touch on a region's natural history, but this one does more than that, and also has some good stories that prepare the traveler. It's good reading."
2,Not as good as Lonely Planet,"We spent 5 days during July 2007 in Estonia. First time I had purchased a Bradt book. I found the Lonely Planet Estonia Latvia & Lithuania superior. There wasn't anything in Bradt that wasn't covered well in Lonely Planet. Bradt does have larger font, fewer photos and way too much info about various trips about, but much of it is personal opinion and more detailed history than this traveller needs. I did not find any factual errors in either."
1,"Don't walk, run away from this phone","I picked up this phone even after seeing the 2 star reviews noting sub-par sound quality. It's true, this phone has the coolest features of any phone I've ever owned but the sound quality was so bad I had to return it. And I don't return anything, ever.After calling my phone companies voicemail system and re-recording my outgoing voice mail message I played it back and the sound was so scratchy I thought maybe my 5 O'clock shadow had been scraping the microphone, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.The speakerphone sounded great on this end, but was horrible for the people you are speaking to.Had this review been on the features of the phone I would've given it 5 stars. But since I actually wanted to use the phone to communicate with people I give it 1 star."
2,Sound quality is bad,"I don't know if there's interference in my area or what, but that sound quality is horrible. Whenever someone talks there's a static sound about their voice. I found it hard to understand people, especially quieter people who call from their cell phone. Otherwise it's a nice phone with nice features. It's also a little hard hold between your ear and shoulder.There are some good features about this, including the expandability, speaker phone, etc, but these just don't make up for the sub par sound quality.If you're like me and hold sound quality in a phone your top priority, I'd avoid this at all costs. I found myself walking downstairs to my corded office phone because I didn't want to use this thing."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this hoping it would be better than the 900 MhZ Vtech we had. I was wrong. On the secondary phone (upstairs, maybe 100 ft away), there is a constant buzzing no matter how close you are to the base.Also, for some reason, it doesn't make outbound calls correctly with our Lingo service. No matter what number you dial, it says that number is not in service.It's promptly going back. Sad that their cordless people can't make it more like the Razr V3."
5,Absolutely great and surprisingly accurate!,":) Honestly, I bought this deck so that they could help me in writing my articles on household and cooking tips and pieces of advice from a spiritual point of view. I thought the pictures would help me with hints so that my ideas could fly. I must say I truly got inspired by the pictures, but this deck is incredibly great and so-so accurate in private questions that I could not believe my eyes!The little booklet is also very helpful and has a lovely appearance, as well as the box the cards came with, so thank you a lot! I wish everyone to find pleasure in these cards, and they are so cheap... If you are a collector, as well - just like me -, this deck will really please you! :)"
5,My new favorite,"I have been reading the Tarot for many years now and have had many favorite decks, but The Housewives Tarot has become my new favorite. This deck is is easy to relate to making it easy to read. The images are wonderful and packed with symbolism. The instructional book gives the interpretation of each card, but still leaves it open enough for your intuition as well. I would recommend this deck to anyone from beginner to advanced."
4,so you want to be June Cleaver?,"In spite of the many tarot decks I own, this one is totally unique in its own right. The cards are inspired by the 1950's Ozzie and Harriet era, yet are easy to understand and easy to read. When the deck was given to me as a gift, I thought it would be just another half-hearted attempt to blend a motif into tarot cards - but this one actually works. The writer and illustrator actually know what the cards mean and have devised a deck that meshes insightful cards with hilarious interpretations. It's well worth the money - whether you're a seasoned reader or a novice."
3,Poor Card Stock,"Cute and charming. I love the recipe box packaging. The 50's style artwork is whimsical and invokes the true spirit of the card meanings. But, I purchased these to do readings on a select group of people. Unfortunately, these cards lack a coating and are very susceptible to getting dirty and/or creased when shuffled or read. This is the second recent set of cards (Deviant Moon being the other) that is produced on poor card stock. They are fun to look at, but unusable without being ruined. Cards should have a coating, like the Rider-Waite decks or other ""regular"" playing cards do. These are strictly for collecting. Not reading."
4,Great cards,"I just love these! They come in a recipe box and the images and definitions are unique to the 50's,They make me smile!"
5,delightful and easy to understand:),"This deck is a hoot.If you are a domestic goddess in any way, you'll identify with the symbols/situations in these cards.The little booklet that comes with the deck explains simply and with humor. You can't misinterpret because of several dozen possible explainations (like some other decks).I love it and if you love simplicity, you will too."
1,This is pink?,"We bought these to light up the house for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. My girlfriend came over, her mom didn't survive, I had her close her eyes and turned on all 5 lights...what a sad joke. Not a glimmer of pink to be seen. Not pink enough to know they are pink when turned on .....very very very pale pink to white really"
1,Graphic,"I cannot believe that this book has so many good reviews. The content was way too graphic for my almost three year old. At one point, the bear pins the squirrel on the ground to where he cant breathe and then he scratches (described in great detail) him down the back. None of the animals in the story look remotely nice. Glad this was only a library book and I didnt waste my money on it."
3,needs improvement,numbers are not reversed on one side to the other (so you have to always unfold the same way - can just flip it around) - also pinches fingers when you close it (very snappy).
4,Does the job,"Very handy for around the house and definitely prefer having the tape read in the correct direction when folding out the end. Would give it five stars, but the quality of the hinges is not going to be a lifetime tool."
4,"So far, very good","I just started using this. In the past I've used straight edge rulers or tape measures. This unit is especially good since once one becomes familiar with how it unfolds, one can estimate the approximate distance and get a firm, non bending, point to point measurement, no matter how long the distance (assuming it is within the maximum distance of the fold out)."
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered a 066F rule from Amazon.com thinking I would get good quality, same sized rule I have used for over 50 years. When I open the box and saw the rule I could tell it was not the same. The problem I have with the rule is the thickness of the wood. Each blade is about .030 thicker than the old standard which makes the rule about 5/16"" wider overall. The length of the rule when folded is also about "" longer. The feel this new 066F rule is not confortable in your hand because of the added blade thickness plus the overall appearance looks cheap. I have been a long time user of Lufkin rules but I'm extremely disappointed in the new 066F rule."
3,A Good Start,"Every book has its target readers. Power Hound's target audience is beginner with little to no knowledge or experience with previous windows version. It also contains a lot of marketing material which may or may not relate directly to XP. For example, it recommends www.efax.com which is a web based fax service and is not tied to just XP.That said, this book does provide some information that both experts and beginners will find usefulPositives:1) A single source for all your windows XP tips and tricks2) Contains examples and screen shots making it very easy to understand the topic.3) It introduced Firefox, the best browser out there. I have now switched completely to firefox because it is faster, more user friendly and much more secured when compared to Microsoft IE.Negatives:1) Too Expensive.2) Too wordy3) Too many ads buried in the text.CONCLUSION: Not worth $25 that I paid for it. Try to get it from a library or read it in a book store before you buy it."
1,reality,"This program did not work..tech from company tried, but offerred no tangible help. Luckily, Microsoft has now launch a free program for the same purpose...suggest to all that you forget this program and use the one that is now available for Vista."
1,defective,"We ordered one of each size of these and the size three in black was fine and is a great little ball. The size four in red won't hold air and deflates in a few hours. Defective. Disappointing when one brother's little ball ""didn't work"" and he feels bad about it."
5,Mikasa soccerball review,I decided to give this one a rating of 4.7 out of 5 (doesn't show on the stars) simply because the ball seemed a tad bit heavy. That might be silly and stupid of me but it does take a while before your feet adapt to the weight. This was my first purchase of a soccer ball from amazon and so far no real disappointment. Only wish that I could have found a cheaper ball; $20 seemed a little much.
1,Came broken,"The hole where air enters was damaged, was not possible to inflate or deflate the ball, so the ball is worthless."
5,Great ball for a great price,It's a basic no frills soccer ball. Excellent construction with a lightly padded shell. Perfect for my three year old.
1,Wow! What a disappointment.,My husband bought me a Simba flute . I didn't play it much after the first couple of months. I pulled it out about two years later to play a tune and then once this year. Now I'm ready to show my daughter how to play and the flute is falling apart.I played a Yamaha flute years ago for 15 years and never had my flute break on me. The material doesn't seem as sturdy. My daughter is so eager to learn and now I have to either worry about getting her another brand or trying to get this one repaired. Hopefully she won't lose interest in the meantime. What ashamed!
4,Flute for begginers,"This flute is a great begginers flute. It arrived with one of the pads unglued. I had to have that part repaired, but for the price and the use it is getting it is a great purchase."
5,"Funky, horn fueled, driving, soulful stuff","These guys have finally reached full swing with this CD. It is a mixture of funk, R&B, ska, rock, and god knows what else. You really can't classify a cd like this. There is a song on here for every mood of the day. And you don't have to be ashmed to let your mom listen. Let her listen. I guarantee that even your mom won't be able to keep still. Rooms By The Hour is a definate for any complete CD collection."
5,Words from Rustic's homestate...,"Captures the TRUE talent of Maine! Buy this cd, you will not be dissapointed. Has some awesome horn bits and the lyrics will stay in your head for days. Go for it. It's good, fresh talent!! Enjoy!!"
4,In concert- Incredible!,"These guys came to SUNY Potsdam this weekend and I instantly fell in love! The lead singer, apparently Dave, was really cool to meet and made a good impression! I'm buying the album by the concert, and the clips from this site. These guys kick!"
1,"Good looks, poor performance","Purchased ViewSonic G90fb 19"" CRT based on other reviews. Much to my surprise this 'Graphics Series' monitor does not perform as expected. Monitor brightness varies depending on the windows that are open on the screen - when there is a large white window open (i.e. My Computer) the screen darkens and shrinks about 1 mm on all sides. When the white window is resized or minimized, the whole screen visibly lightens and expands. After spending two months back-and-forth with ViewSonic customer support, and exchanging the original unit for a replacement which has the same problem, it was determined by a VS engineer that this performance is within the model specifications. Bottom line: it is OK to use the G90f series for office work and email, but serious graphic users should explore other options."
4,Favorite Kid Show,"I was very excited to find that Bobby's World was out on dvd. These episodes were great but the dissapointment came when there were no special features, but at least they released some episodes. More should be released."
5,Great!,This is a great DVD i got for my brother for christmas.. he loves it its in great condition and its the best episodes of a show we used to rush home from school to watch
4,Currently Touring With Sarah Mclachlan,"I would like to thank Sarah McLachlan for introducing The Perishers to the U.S. audiences. They are great! I purchased the album at her concert in Sunrise, Florida. I was worth the money. I'll be looking forward to their upcoming album."
2,Skip this emotionless dribble,"I was going to say how overrated this album is, but since there'sonly 2 reviews so far....Seriously, I generally like just about everything on the Nettwerk label, but they really dropped the ball on this one. Who ever it was over there who gave the ok to release this to the public should be seriously questioned for musical tastes. Nothing against the band (I really know nothing about them), but I put all the blame on the Record label Co. for releasing it. Not ONE track stood out. If you're looking for some emotionally stirring music, you won't find it here."
1,"FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR EARS, DONT BUY THIS CD!","IF YOU WANT MUSIC TO KILL YOURSELF TO, THEN BUY THIS ALBUM, IT MADE ME WANT TO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE THE MOMENT I HEARD THE FIRSTNOTE...IT IS HORRIBLE...HOPEFULLY THEY WILL ONLY GET A 30 MIN SET (JUST ENOUGH TIME TO HIT THE HOT DOG STAND AND WOOF DOWN A FEW BEERS)...YOU WANT TO HEAR A REAL BAND...BUY ANYTHING BY DREAM THEATER...I HOPE THE PERISHERS PERISH REAL SOON CUZ THEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF THE VERY INSTRUMENTS THEY OWN...CHEERS!"
4,perfect rainy day music,"The Perisher's cd, Let There Be Morning, Doesn't try to trick you with overly- catchy lyrics, or over used guitar riffs, instead, they stand out with their honest lyrics, and haunting sound. In some of their songs, like ""a Reminder"" the group sounds older than their years with a rougher sound, that brings a nice subtle variety on the album.The music is so pure and calming, that you can't help but stop and just think. The whole album is a gem, and after hearing the whole album a couple times, you will agree that the guys will continue to entertain people successfully even after the European band boom fades out."
4,Positively Incandescent,"Reflective | Longing | Yearning - like a timeless afternoon Sunday drive alone... And like the sights seen on a Sunday drive - so too do the melodies and lyrics by these 4 lads from Northern Sweden. Understated and soft, avoiding overdone, lush effects and production.If you want *real music*, give this album a chance."
2,ehh,Really not all that great for the price. It's not very deep and the castle falls apart easily. If you try to put both sand and water in it- they mix quickly into a muddy mess. Not even very useful as a regular table because the cover is not flat.
3,Pretty Good for the Price,"My son really liked playing with the table this summer when he was about 14-17 months old, but he had more fun than I did with it. It was a bit hard to get together, but not impossible. Getting it to stay together is worse. The castle falls apart at a touch, and the water plug is always a struggle to get in the right position to not let all the water leak out. The dragon, knight and princess are cute, but don't fit in the little boat well to float around the moat. I never tried sand in it, but would expect that the sand would get mixed into the water area pretty easily because of the design. Overall, I spent all my time putting the castle back together again while my son happily played with the garden hose."
3,Ok for the price,"I purchased this model because it was on sale. It was good for the price. The legs were a little hard to screw in, and it doesn't seem too sturdy. However, as long as my little one doesn't try to sit on it, we'll be fine. I found the castle to stay together just fine, as long as the top pieces snap in properly. I wish that the sand portion of the table was larger, but my 2-1/2 year old still seems to enjoy it."
4,Just a few tweeks....,"I purchased this sand table for my 2 & 3 year olds. I have to agree with the other reviews about the castle not staying together. I ended up tossing mine out (but keeping the little figures it came with). As far as the legs being installed, I had no problem and as long as the kids don't excessively lean on it, I think it is pretty sturdy. My solution for the small sand tray..... I filled the whole thing with sand. I liked this concept over the traditional sandboxes because the cover gives it a pretty tight seal. No issue of fleas, bugs or feces get in there. I also like that even with the sand in the table, I can still lift it and bring it into the garage for storage. For the $$ (and you can buy it cheaper at the stores) I think it is a great product."
2,"Fun for kids, hassle for parents.","Table is fun for children as they can play with sand and water indoors, however the castle constantly falls apart from poor quality. The legs on table are difficult to get on unless you own a screw gun and can't be easily stored. I bought at littletykes.com for a lot cheaper than they're selling on this site."
5,LAW CLERK,THIS IS AN EXCELENT REMEDY CASEBOOK. PROBLEMS ARE VERY HELPFUL FOR EXAM PREPORATION. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANY REMEDY COURSE.
3,dylan plays just as his music at that time,"Bob Dylan not at his best in this movie,but still you will have to see it if you are a Dylan fan.There are some moments when Dylan will make a smile on your face."
1,Make Sure You Get The Right Video,"I thought I was getting Bob Dylan, but Clevon Little's Movie instead; if you're buying used make sure you're getting the right one. I wasn't one of the lucky one's and would like to spare someone else the same (Jack) Fate :O)"
5,Master OF The Rare Laserdiscs Movies,I have HEARTS OF FIRE THE LASERDISC!!! I like it and I'd like to get it on DVD too :)
4,Almost pure camp fun for Dylan fans...,"...except you will need to use the fast-forward button on your remote when Bobby isn't onscreen. He performs a song called ""The Usual"" that's still in my head after only seeing it once! I heard it wasn't written by him, but I'm sure he does it justice like noone else can in this film.Oh, and I love the little serenade in the barn at the end.=)Another thing is I really like Fiona Flanagan's music, which of course helps when you're watching this..a cool chick.Peace out,R&C"
3,Dylan with curly blonde hair?,I've wanted to see this movie just because Dylan was in it. Why else should anyone see it?Holding up the bus driver with a harmonica and having a fridge of eggs were the gems.
2,Something is happening here. . . . .,"While not as bad as most reviewers claim, it is a wasted effort. Dylan fans will find a few gems mixed in the mess. All and all a big disappointment despite Dylan's performance and appearances by Ritchie Havens and Ron Wood. Embarrassing at times."
2,Not the fun kind of chicken ranch...,"Ok, to start with, yes, this movie was so funny I choked. Like the other reviewers, I only bought it for my precious Bob. To answer some questions you may have, no, the main character and Bob do not get it on in the hay, because she's not that smart. No, the main character does not die a fiery death, because the producers aren't that kind.Bob Dylan goes through the entire movie with an ""I hope you all die"" expression on his face, which is perfectly suitable considering the lines he's being forced to say.Rupert Everett is all broody and sensitive and painfully boring in this movie and he made me want to hang myself. The only problem is, you can only hang yourself once.Any music in this film that doesn't come from the mouth of Bob is painfully bad, so have that remote control handy.Would I buy it again, you ask? Sure, if only to see Bob screw with his image yet again."
4,Cute little hearts and beads,"I really like the hearts on this, they are a nice size and not too overpowering. I thought they might drag too much but the weight seems to be fine and it looks really cute with the cross and rosary bead necklace.I am planning on liking this as much as I have enjoyed my other Paris design purchases."
3,Not bad,"These are nice exhaust tips, but they're starting to yellow a month after I had them put on. The Magnaflow logo is also distracting -- when I redo the exhaust setup I'm going to look for unbranded tips.Amazon's price is quite competitive and their shipping had the exhaust tips to me on Saturday morning. I had an exhaust shop put these in and I hit a car show after lunch. Awesome."
5,heplfull,vary help full! Received a replacement item at no charge and will do business with them again. pleasure doing business with them.
3,Works but...,"It was sealed in an anti-static bag, but when I opened it, the USB connector was rusty! It worked, but I was a bit disappointed in the quality control."
1,IT DID NOT WORK,"I BOUGHT THIS CABLE AND IT DIDNT WORK IT DIDNT CHARGER ANY OF MY PDA""S AND IT SAID IT WAS MADE FOR A IPOD MINI"
4,Great for a beginner,"Julie writes for the beginner who is learning the basics of digital photography. She covers many subjects from selecting a camera and computer setup to macro photography and printing. If you have experience with film (or no experience whatsoever) and are switching to digital and have no idea what you are doing, this is a good book for you. If you have a few years of experience, not needing to learn the basics, you might be a bit dissapointed as I was. I recommend the book for the audience that I described as Julie even included ""tips"" to do things on the cheap, using little known tricks or features."
2,Trigon revisited,"This is sequel to 'Kid's game' and second book of Teen Titan's relaunch but, for me, story was lame. Main villain is some kinda warlock/gothic guy and there is lot of blood, bones and splatter, as if Clive Barker wrote a book (or you are playing Diablo). Artwork is good, but story reminds me too much of fight with Trigon in original Titan's first story arc...I guess don't like magic/gothic stories in superhero books."
4,Teen-er-ific!,I must say that I did not expect much from this book when I bought it but was pleasently surprised to find out that I had not wasted my money. The art work is superb! I love it! And the story is pretty intesting too.If you've seen the series on TV and think that this is just some lame comicbook version you're wrong. This is quite different from the series. It a more adult version (obviously if you look at StarFire's costume that's pretty clear).
3,Horrible Quality,"This isn't a revied of the contents of the book, you cant find that anywhere on the internet. I'm reviewing the physical book its self and comparing it to vol. 1 I ordered from Barnes and Noble. First of all the cover was not shinny like B&N's was. And second, the whole book fell completely out of the front and back cover the second day I had it. The binding was just some cheap glue. I'm worried individual pages are next. My B&N book is still in perfect condition months later. Lesson to be learned, don't buy from amazon."
3,"Sure, why not?",Go ahead and buy this book if you like the various Teen Titans titles. You could do a lot worse.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"If however many Brother Bloods were not a problem for the Teen Titans, you can throw in the 11/10 amoral man Deathstroke, and his evil supervillain daughter. Hooboy has he screwed her up.So, some good bad guys to cause the midget type heroes some problem sin this trade."
3,Weaker Second Chapter,"In this second chapter of the saga of the new Titans the art continues to be very strong. However the story suffers in comparison to A Kid's Game.The problem I believe is primarily Raven. Raven is a very very difficult character to sell to the reader. Despite the sympathetic background, the empath isn't a character that readers can warm up to. Add in the fact that the new Brother Blood is fairly goofy and the story really doesn't work.The part of the story that works well is the minor plot of Deathstroke and Ravager. Lovely uniform for Ravager, and great cold-hearted characterization as well.Development of the Titans both within the team and without continues, albeit slowly, very well. A true team spirit is beginning to develop. I hope the rebirth of the cold, aloof Raven does not forebode a bad turn in the camaraderie of the team."
4,good oldie,great selection. I know I will be using this one for a long time. These are the recipies my mom used to use.
5,Mr. Womack's written another great Denton detective novel.,"I think this is Mr. Womack's best Harry James Denton work to date. The storyline and character development are believable, and he describes Nashville and the surrounding areas, such as Williamson County where I live, perfectly. Be sure to read the Denton series in order in which they were written to track the character developments, and also see the change in the political climate in the Metro Nashville area."
3,OK.,"I ordered 4 more place settings for this Thanksgiving. I have a larger service that I own and bought about 7 years ago. My old service is 18/8 and is heavier and more deeply hammered. I was dissapointed in the new 18/10 pieces as they are smoother and lighter. I'm keeping them because I need them. I missed a better price, so if you aren't in a hurry keep checking as they at one point were only 12.99 a place setting."
3,disappointed,"Thought it would match exactly with what I had, but it didn't. The handles were shaped differently, otherwise it was okay."
5,"One of my oldest, best loved CDs","This was one of the first CDs I bought when I got my first CD player. I think I had heard Mr. Chow on the radio and just had to have it. Even better,not long after I got it AA came to my town (Reston, VA, circa 1992) to play at our little smooth jazz fest at Lake Fairfax Park. I got to see them up close as it started to rain and everyone else ran. To see Nick and Greg up close and personal was an incredible experience! Now that Nick is gone I feel a deep sadness. The memory of that rainy day concert will be with me forever. I only wish we'd had cellphones with cameras back then.God bless you, Nick."
5,Truly great music!,"This is a really, really great CD! I heard Jamaica Heartbeat on the radio. It was the most awesome song I had ever heard. I bought this album because of that one song, and I have not been disappointed by the other songs. This CD makes great background music while you do other things, but at the same time you can listen closely to it and admire the artistry. I showed the CD to my brother and father and now they are hardcore Acoustic Alchemy fans. Truly great music!"
3,Great Album,"I was climbing out of bed and all I could think was NAPSTER, NAPSTER, NAPSTER. With that buzzing in my head, I proceeded to download this entire album for absolutely NO COST! The soothing sounds of this album quieting the pirating demons in my head... for now at least. Great Album! Keep em coming, I have plenty of room left on my hard drive!"
4,A 2nd A.D.'s two-cents.,"I recieved this book as a gift, and got a lot from it. It is dated, and based mostly on West-coast studio work, (2 things I am not), but there was still a great deal of information for me to continue my education in the Assistant Director department. I also found the UPM info a learn expearence, since that is not my speciality. I wish there were more AD books like it out there."
3,Worthwhile for older markings,"This book has a terrific layout. The right page has 50 or more markings while the left page lists easily referenced details. Unfortunately, the details can be sketchy. For example, (one listing) Paris, some factory, Charles Phillipe or (another listing) Sceaux? or Bourg la Reine? Doubtful.I bought this book to accompany me on my European flea market travels. It is a reprint of a book originally published in 1937. So all of the markings are for things that are much older than I'm likely to find in our local flea markets. However, should I come across one, I'll be ready for it. :)"
5,Works Great,"I wish the people at Office Depot would have told me that my printer didn't come with a USB cable when I bought it, but they didn't, and so when I tried to set it up, I realized that I had no way of connecting it to my computer. Fortunately, I was able to get it here on Amazon for around $5, and it works great. Super fast shipping too!"
4,USB Cable excellence,The product is exactly as described and the shipping was very reasonable. I would recommend for any users that have chewing pups to have a couple on hand....they always seem to find the right spot to chew...
5,Great!,This diaper stacker is great!!! It's big enough to hold a pack of diapers!!! It looks great in my daughter's room!!!
4,"Good book, includes a cd-rom, lists useful websites",Some of the things this book discusses aboutThe apgar score of a newborn (includes a table)What a newborn baby looks likeGives a partial list of a newborn's reflexesCircumcisionJaundiceLayette for the 1st 6-8 weeks for babyIntroducting baby and petHygiene and aftercareFeeding babyMyths of breastfeedingCommon questions a new mom may haveDeveloping healthful sleep habitsSleep tipsCommunicating with your babyCaring for baby's hygeine which includes bathing your babyEnjoying your babyWhat to take with your baby when going out such as running errandsYour baby's health- wellness and illness
5,Great!,"I buy this cable today, and its really great.I had the official sony cable, but this monster its some betterThe best cable for ps3 (component)i recommend this product"
3,Great Cable. Fragile,Its a great cable that provides crisp picture but try your hardest not to get it wet. Someone spilled some water on the end of the cable and it ruined the picture. I would have never expected this product to be so fragile.
3,"Overpriced, but great quality","If you can't get HDMI, then Component A/V Cable is the way to go. I have the Monster Game Component A/V Cable for PS2 and it is the same except mine is blue (since blue is the PS2 theme color) and it works on all of the PlayStations since 1997. I would recommend that anyone looking to buy HD cables for their PS3 get a regular brand HDMI cable (Philips is perfect at just $33) or a Sony Component A/V Cable ($14.95 compared to Monster Game's outrageous $59.99!!!!!). Monster Cable's prices are just daft!"
5,Enjoyable despite the inevitable ending,"Extremely well researched and written. Glorious photos. The very epitome of 1930s Art Deco at Sea. Gosh, I wish I had been alive when she was. I sure would have liked to sail her at least once. A GREAT read during a Caribbean cruise while in a deck chair sipping a Margarita - Ahhhh."
1,"Very biased, Author belongs in extreme minority of Scholarship","This is an extraordinarily liberal account of the NT and Christianity. I would say that he blatantly misinterprets texts, completely ignores sections of the Bible, uses extremely loaded language, and is very anti-Christian. If you must buy this textbook (for class), I would highly suggest buying another NT introduction (perhaps by D.A. Carson) to be able to check these claims. While I do not find the dates to be wildly inaccurate (through my other research), Harris blatantly manipulates the Christian viewpoint and doctrine. If you want a good discussion of early Christian history, go to a Christian author, or at least an objective secular one. Harris sets out to discredit early Christendom, but only ruins his reputation and any semblance of scholarship in the process."
3,The New Testament - A Student Introduction,"It is a well written book, but not a well rounded book. Like most studies it looks at 19th and 20th century research as more valued than 1st and 2nd century sources. Also positions on text are stated without the supporting information being presented or sited.There is no exploration into the Textus Receptus (King James) vs. the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus (Most modern translations including the Modern King James), and the impact or potential impact of one translation versus the other.But this is only an introduction. Also because it is only an introduction I would say that the price is higher than it should be."
4,Text Book Purchase,"The text book was at a very good price but the condition was slightly off from the description. It was rated ""good"" and there was slight water damage and I am not sure if the book store at my university will purchase the book back after I am finished with the class. Which is why I paid a little more for a ""good"" book versus an ""acceptable"" book which this one is. On the good side though I ordered the book at 11am on Wednesday and recieved the book first thing Thursday morning."
3,Just a start,"This sparse book might be a good place to start when talking to children about bullying, but there simply IS NOT enough information to provide any real resolution to the problem."
1,Zero stars really,"I agree that this book is over rated. I read the editorial review and thought I would be getting a book which would speak to the spiritual and sexual aspects of each astrological sign.However it really seems to tie into ""old think"" regarding the roles of men and women and portrays people in a terms of negative attributes. Also, I am not close minded regarding Sexuality and Slang etc., but the writing in this book regarding sexuality uses slang terms in a way which only further weakens any positive points the writers may have been trying to convey."
5,"GEMINI Looove, YEAH!","I highly recommend this book, it's great read! I'm planning a trip to Brazil so that I can meet my future wife... I just KNOW she will be a Gemini... or maybe a Scorpio. I'm keeping my options open!"
1,Waste,"I've been into astrology for quite a long time, and this is a book that I came across that really hit my interest. However, when I received it, and started reading about my own sign, Pisces, I really feel most of it does not describe me, or a true Pisces at all. Another review mentioned if you are a Pisces, you should avoid this book, and now I completely regret ignoring that advice. Be aware."
5,I've been converted!,"I never was one for astrology, but this book is so smart and so accurate, I've been completely turned around. It's freaky how dead-on the descriptions of each sign are. Plus the writing is so sharp and funny (and VERY sexy), it's absolutely impossible to put down. I stayed up reading (mostly about my exes) till 2 last night. My friends keep begging me to lend them my copy, but they'll have to get their own; I just can't let go. Stella Starsky and Quinn Cox are my new idols! Buy this book for yourself and your friends. You'll thank me."
2,a grain of salt,"This book is, at best, interesting. As with most astrology books, its content needs to be taken with a grain of salt unless you know more about the individual persons chart. The sexual turn ons sections were interesting, and had most of mine listed. but then there were other things in there that didn't describe me at all. And a lot of the people I have talked to who were of different signs didn't agree with what the book had to say. So, again, it comes down to getting to know the individual person and not just traits of their zodiac sun sign. It also uses Greek mythology as a basis for its comparisons. So if you don't now too much about it, then you might be confused. Luckily i wasn't put off by that. Its a FUN book to read, but nothing in it is concrete."
2,Disappointed,"If anyone were interested in finding out about my sign via this particular book, they might shy away if they didn't have the common sense to realize that people do have several astrological factors that make up their signs. Being generalized is certainly unrealistic. There are traits that every sign has in common, but these authors have really gone off the deep end. In all the paragraphs they've written about each sign, I found VERY LITTLE accuracy in my own and other people I know. I have been into astrology for many, many years, and own several Astrology books written by esteemed astrologists. Actually was annoyed when I finished the book."
1,If you're a Pisces AVOID.,"I am amazed at the amount of positive reviews this book has recieved. My guess is that none of the reviewers were Pisces.This book does indeed ""pick up where Linda Goodman left off"" in that it continues with the Goodman school of Pisces bashing. If you are one of the millions ""unfortunate"" enough to have been born between 20th Feb - 20th March (i.e, a Pisces) do yourself a favour and just keep browsing. Trust me you wont regret it.You will however, regret it if you spend your hard earned cash on it. Prepare to have your ego shredded....""Back-stabbing bitch...Frog-like, Prissy Pisces"" (these are all technical terms in astrology apparantly).That's just the tip of the iceberg.I see the author's are married...my guess is one or both of them had an affair with a Pisces.To the rest of the 11 signs, knock yourselves out."
1,THESE WRITERS ARE NOT ASTROLOGERS - NOT THE REAL DEAL,"This is obviously two smart writers who got together with the idea to do something in ""astrology"" and that's as far as it goes. The writing is good - they're good writers - but it's ALL a re-hash of ALL that has been said before, with some S&M; / gay /trendy fetishy additions thrown in. Clever writing - but no salami.I was really disappointed - it looked SO promising! I felt like I'd been snookered - a case of the Emperor's Clothes - and had wasted my money.It's a bit disrespectful of the astrological community actually - poking their nose at astrology while making off with money from their book. I wouldn't be surprised if they come up with another natty idea next!NOT FOR ANYONE SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN ASTROLOGY.BUT IF YOU WANT A TRENDY COCKTAIL CHIT-CHAT BOOK - THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU."
1,Not to be taken seriously,"Having read widely in Astrology I would say this must have been written with tongue in cheek, its just not credible. Might be fun for a giggle at a party."
2,Grossly over rated,"I purchased this book thinking it would provide me with a different appraoch to astrology , only to find it seem to do nothing but outline the possible flaws in each sun sign, I think this book is very one sided and biased and do not recommend it to anyone, buy Linda Goodmans books theyre much better and more value for money , this book is not worth buying."
3,Very accurate,The book is very helpful in explaining the different personalities so you not only better understand yourself but the other signs and why they are the way they are. Knowing that just makes it easier to accept(or not) yourself as well as the others so you don't take things so personally. Which is huge!! It's a great source of reference.
4,Delicious,"This is a very smart book: the writers' style is superb, and the presentation is excellent. The authors' have a fine grasp of the legends and myths that inform Western astrology, and they present some ideas that are very original. There's not a stuffy, dull sentence in the book.Initially, I thought some of the signs received a more flattering assessment than others, but upon re-reading I don't think this is the case. Each sign is considered from a standpoint that is both original and provocative, and the reader may find themselves re-evaluating what they thought they knew about each sign (for instance, when was the last time Capricorn was perceived as a bon vivant?).This is a stunningly written book that I would recommend as, primarily, entertainment; but just when you think you're having fun the authors frequently surprise you with a remark that is astonishingly accurate. Enjoy!"
5,So descriptive!!! Love it!!,"This book is perfect for anyone who loves or has interest in astrology. It talks a lot about the Astrological signs, but goes even further than all other books by adding sex. It is very descriptive-for you prudes out there-and I find that it relates well to the individual. Even goes into the gay sex as well, which is definitely a bonus. It's overall fascinating!This book definitely gives you a basic idea of what you probably already know about who you are but like to see it on paper anyway. I am going to keep this one forever. Love it!!!"
2,confusing!,"So I purchased these deck of cards, but I ended up giving it to my step daughter, and maybe she can make some use out of those cards, am not saying there a bad deck of cards.....I just dont understand them , layout or spreads are too big and it comes with a lil booketlet not really a booklet....idk what to call it, but it explains how to do a spread and gives you an example on how to do a reading for a man and women,I really thought I was really gonna like it but i didn't. Very disappointed"
2,A bit scary,When I got the set I immediately want to look at them. The messages were direct and scared me a little bit. They gave me a negative energy and let me decide to put them away for a while. The cards can always be used as an ordinary set of cards so I can use them as tarot or not.I'm not sure if the cards are good for me in the tarot use. The future can tell!
1,Worthless ... except for party games,"I have been a card reader for 34 years and I found these to be worthless. If you are going to a costume party as a fortune telling Gypsy, they are a good prop, but if you are serious about trying to learn how to tell fortunes, find something else."
3,It's so so,"Not the best system kinda looks like a lenormand cards knock off but, its more fun when using as a game for sleep over parties rathr than for divining."
1,"awful, especially for beginers","I am a begining card reader, I ordered a three books. of those books, I liked the one by richard webster, and the one by jane lyle....I also ordered these cards........ I think these cards are garbage unless you want to send a friend a gag gift, but even then i'm still not sure... the meanings of the cards are written on each card, but they are not accurate. I love webster for the information on the reading and lyle for the interpretation. I think a smart card reader even as a beginner if they are in earnest, as I am will recognize that these cards are bunk... because they are. don't waste your money if you are serious about wanting to learn cartomancy. they are trash. period. and they feel bad. I am going to burn them."
3,Not your standard tarot deck.,"The Gypsy Witch deck contains only 52 cards, as opposed to the usual 78 in a tarot deck. These cards more closely resemble a standard deck of playing cards than a deck of tarot cards, as well. They are not as colorful or artistic as some of the tarot decks. They are easy to read, as the meaning of each card is printed on it. The booklet that accompanies the deck is helpful. These cards might be good for a beginner."
4,Mostly Neat,"These cards are pretty cool. I have Tarot cards already (also by US Games) and wanted something a little bit different. The face designs are retro looking (I especially like that the extra jokers are just cards with EXTRA JOKER printed on them, too funny) and that they can be used as regular playing cards is a bonus.THAT SAID. I hate the design on the back. It is design pictured on the box above, only in a purple gradient. It is hideous. If it was the exact design on the box that would be fine but the purple graident looks amateurish. I don't really have to LOOK at the backs so it isn't a huge deal. But I really like the retro styling of the face design and I was expecting a complimentary design on the back. Kind of a bummer."
2,My least accurate deck.,"The look and history I found on these were interesting enough to make me give them a try. I cleansed them, tried to bond with them, etc. I'm not going to get too deep into all the goings on, but they just aren't for me. Maybe I'm in the minority, but being inaccurate was the least of my problems with this deck. I hope others have better luck."
4,Just fun,"I used to own this deck and lost a few cards, was glad to see you still could get them, and we used them in a class that was Anthropology of Religion on a section on fortune telling."
2,I would stay away from this food,"I fed this to my dog for 3 months and it gave him dandruff and the worst gas you have ever smelled. My parents feed their dogs Ol'Roy dog food and they seem a million times healthier than my dog. I'm switching him to Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lovers Soul, its cheaper and more natural."
3,Smells old,The dog food smelled strange. Kind of like old fishy smell. I purchased the same bag in a local store and didn't have this smell.Could it just be the Omega 3s in the food?My puppy didn't mind eating it though
3,not sure,"i recently got a shih tzu pup and his breeder was feeding him purina pup chow but from what i read the main ingre. should be meat in a pups food so i ordered this and mixed part of her food in with this for a week or so until just feeding him this,he eats it but from hte ingredients it has fillers and biproducts in it so once the 8lb bag gets low i will be ordering some blue buffalo for him to see if he eats it because from what i hear its much better no bi-products or fillers so i will be reviewing that once we transition."
4,The many tales of Olive Oatman,"I found that there are so many books on this woman,that I am now trying to get through them all.The opinions of the writers are strong,and must be seen through.I feel the Blue Tatoo to be the most entertaining however."
1,Revisionist Assault on the Oatman Family,"This is a deeply flawed, revisionist retelling of the Oatman Massacre. McGinty leaves out the shockingly brutal details of the assault and captivity. Instead we get seemingly endless speculation about which tribes may have been involved and what their motivations may have been.In an apparent attempt to protect book sales, Amazon refused to post my original review of this book which challenges some of McGinty's most ridiculous and disturbing speculations.Unless you are looking for a revisionist account of the massacre and captivity, avoid this book. The original account, as related by Olive Oatman after her liberation, is still available. You don't need someone like McGinty to interpret it for you."
3,Good factual book,"While this book was very factually accurate in its description of the events which shaped Olive Oatman's life forever, at times it was a very slow read. Don't get me wrong, it was very well written and researched but it just didn't have that kind of gripping energy that keeps you up late reading. It is an excellent account and definitely worth the read though so please don't let me discourage you from reading it, I just felt that it at times, dwelled too much on the factual correctness of Royal Strattons original account of the incidents and not enough on being the kind of compelling read that keeps you coming back for more. But hey, that's just me..."
2,Interesting Confusion,"Over 100 years after the incident the author attempts to dissect statements made by the victim adding more confusion to the historical incident. When attempting to discriminate to determine who can be more accurate, the author or the person who lived the experience, I have to give more credence to the victim."
3,Assumptions,"I feel like this book is based on alot of assumptions from the author. This woman was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress so if you have never had that condition you can only guess what her actions meant. I am sure the media back then was like it is today ...pure sensationalism and a lot of lies generated to sell newpapers. I do like how the author laid down a very strong foundation by going back to the beginning of her family's life and the religious aspect in the story. I like a historical book to be based on fact and not a ""I think this is why she was doing that"" kind of a thing. I would go to your library to find this book and borrow it from there."
5,Great rack,Strong and sturdy rack for hanging utensils. I have no room in my kitchen (no drawers that is) so this is most helpful. We definitely recommend to anyone!
1,I wouldnt know,"Took two weeks after the order,then I get a 10.00 meter,that I didn't order.No one responds to emails,now Im waiting for a refund,that could take another few weeks.People like this give Amazon a black eye,with this type service.I would stay away,unless you want to play games with your money for a month!!Edit: when I first saw this meter,it said (no reviews)odd for someone that was sold out,that no one had anything to say about them.Makes me believe they were trying to sell a product they never had.Now its says they are out and dont know if they will ever get any more!!!(yea right)Apparently someone had time to type that in,but could not answer an email.Edit again: seller contacts me,and says they messed this order up from top to bottom and will send the correct one for free.When I get it,I will review the product in a proper way!!"
4,Theologically Rich And Fervent,I just began to read this small gem but it's already worth it's weight in gold. Marvelously edifying and chock full of Reformation goodness. I am enjoying it immensely.
4,German Expressionism-documents-End of Wilelmine Empire to Rise to socislm.,"I'm sorry, but as an artist, I want to see more examplesof the pictures, of the art, and there are a very great booksthat become bibles for some artists( I have a few, as I say...that are what artists makes a brush stroke and.... if they do it right.I love all the great artists and there are many, and i think webroke ourselves down into ism's. and we still do it today and still remembered b day.I love the manifestos, I love the deep talk about the German Expressionism's.I also enjoyed the crossing of groups. Maybe , if we grouped artists,by isms, this would be easier to keep track, anticipate trends and groups.,designers, artists. Wise words in such a screwed up world.these germanartists . The Riset of Socialism.it is a good read. Joe"
4,Good Introduction To Captain Fingers,"I'm gonna be blunt- everyone might not like this. I heard ""Night Rhythms"" on V98.7 fm in Detroit, Michigan and thought- ""Man, I need to pick up the album on which that song is on."" I didn't wanna take a gamble, so I got a compilation album by Ritenour. Frankly, I thought ""The Collection"" was a little too latin-accented. But it grew on me. My favorites are ""Early A.M. Attitude,"" ""Night Rhythms,"" ""Asa,"" ""Is It You,"" & ""The Sauce."" But that's just me. I think anybody who has a spark of interest in Ricky Martin, Marc Anthoni, & Enrique Iglesias might be able to digest this more the average jazz fan. Maybe Martin fanatics will like the hispanic sound that ""Captain Fingers"" re-creates more than I do (or is it just a pre-millenium fad? hmmm.....). But anywho, pick up the album."
4,GRP Digital Masters Show the Way!,"If there is any doubt about the advantage of doing things right the first time, GRP digital masters shows us why it's important to start with a great master source. This Lee Ritenour collection is a very good sampling of his best work in probably what was his most productive period i.e. the 80s. The tunes are every light jazz/pop fusion fan's delight and the sound quality although not remastered is quite good. I can only imagine how much better a remastered version of this already great recording would sound. If you are into great guitar playing, get this and the Larry Carlton Collection. Recommended."
1,irritable elevator music,I have never heard anything more synonomous with cheap traditional instrumental jazz before. It is perfect...for listening to in an elevator. The sort of music that would take two tracks to send you around the twist. There is a world of class jazz out there...don't waste your time here.
5,Great ideas,"This is a wonderful little book full of ideas for ways to help ease your daughter, or other girl in your life, into womanhood. Many generations never talked about these things and it is helpful to me to have some ideas. I modified the idea about the china plate and used it with a girls' Sunday School class I teach. They had a sleep over at my house and I served them cream puffs on my grandmother's china while I talked to them bout being ""God's fine china plate"". You can easily adapt some of these ideas to fit your needs. I am sure there are people out there who don't need help with this but it is a very sweet book and it sure helped me! This would also make a great gift to a friend whose daughter is just entering this stage of life. It is set up beautifully and very much a ""gift book"", not just informational."
5,good book,I bought this book for my neices and they really enjoyed it.The book was in good shape and I was happy with it.Thanks
4,Sweet and gentle yet filled with great challenges,Enjoyed this gift book on easing a daughter or other dearly loved girl into being a lady. I cannot wait to share some of these ideas with my own daughters and nieces one day.
3,Not as good as Getter Robo Armageddon.,"I have been following the Getter Robo franchise in the U.S. since its release as The Starvengers in the early 80's as a segment of Force Five. I've always been a fan of The Starvengers, even though it was a bit campy, and was extremely pleased with the Getter Robo Armageddon series released by ADV Films. On that note, I found myself less than satisfied with the first installment of the New Getter Robo series. The mecha designs were very interesting, but the overall story and character development was somewhat lacking. I really want to like the series, and will probably give it a second shot, but if you are looking for the same storay quality that was present in Getter Robo Armageddon, you might be disappointed."
3,Molly Brown DVD,"This is an extremely short DVD and all the information given on the DVD can be found on the molly brown house website. I had purchased this DVD for a school project. Though the DVD is a good product and well put together, it was of no use to me with my school project."
5,Awesome exercise book.,"this book completely motivated me to start exercising regularly, and exercise correctly for my body type! there is no other exercise book i would recommend to anyone. it has such great insight to what exercise really is! :) great eye-opener!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"I agree with the reviewer that said that this book is shameless self-promotion.I started reading & it & got so fired up that I had to put it down. I've been a group exercise instructor for years & would never tell a student not to turn up the tension on a bike b/c it can make his/her legs bulky.Page 74, on Yoga, reads ""... Although I think yoga has advantage, it is still passive exercising... But yoga alone will not get or keep you fit. It is also very time consuming... When it is all said and done, I think the benefits of yoga are more mind oriented than body oriented.""Most of the tips and advice that are true, like those about heart rate, aren't anything new & definitely not something a new exerciser would need to buy a book to learn."
1,This,"This book was only written for the author's self-promotion, and that of his company. His theories often make no sense, and are never supported with scientific or documented empirical proof. Of course certain pieces make (common) sense, but you can find many much better fitness and weight-control books. Don't bother about this one."
2,I wonder what kind of PHD does Mr. Jackowski have?,"As a Physical trainer with an advanced degree in Exercise Science and several national certifications I find this book egregiously misleading. The author spewes out 'fact' after 'fact' with no scientific basis (except for his own practical experience!). If you buy this book please take his word with a grain of salt. In addition, there are several exercises depicted in this book that will cause more harm then help.The only reason I give this book 2 stars is for his body type descriptions....they are easy to understand and extremely marketable."
4,"A very helpful, eye-opening book","This book is very interesting in that the author points out that many popular notions about exercise are actually fallacies. I found this book to be a real eye-opener in many ways...it includes a really nice workout that would work for anyone (and it doesn't cost you in terms of equipment or a gym). The author says this book is for anyone who doesn't really exercise or does and is not happy with the results. I haven't been happy with the different fitness regimens i've tried, and this book showed me why. I'm excited to try some of the ideas in this book--like jump roping, which the author says is actually NOT bad for one's knees/joints...If you're ready for some new, interesting information about exercise, read this book."
1,Hold It! this book is terrible,"What a waste of money. Thank goodness it was cheap. Everything in the book is simply common sense. It is a basic, no wait, very basic list (aka ""tips"") of well known exercise beliefs. It doesn't come close to living up to the info-mercial that probably brought you here. I urge you to look else where, unless you are anti-equipment and pro-jump rope."
1,"Hated this book, couldn't finish","I read about half of this book before I gave it up as a bad job. I was expecting tips on what kind of exercises to do, but the book (at least the first half) says nothing of use. The author spends much time talking about how he knows everything and you, the reader, know nothing. This book had nothing to say except to tell the reader how stupid they are and how much they need his advice (which doesn't follow in a timely fashion). I think I saw one bit of information on the types of exercise you should be doing based on your body type, but it didn't feel at all credible. Maybe there's something magical and helpful in the last half of the book, but I couldn't stomach it. Steer clear. This book is less than useless."
2,Not so sure about this . . .,"I have exercised consistently for 10 years. I have taken group exercise classes, worked with trainers, and just in general read a lot and done a lot of my own personal research on exercise and diet. I do agree with a few of his points like other reviewers said. However, I whole-heartedly disagree with his comments on the stairmaster. I lost 70 pounds and most definitely decreased the size of my thighs, hips, and butt by doing the stairmaster. That machine was the sole source of my cardio work-outs. I did some light weights as well, but I contribute my weight loss to the stairmaster and to eating less. I think it's highly unlikely that a cardio machine is going to make you bulkier. The only way you will add bulk is by doing heavy weights and by gaining weight in general from eating too many fatty foods. Cardio and light weights will not make you bulky!"
5,This book changed my life!,"Edward Jackowski is my personal hero. I followed the advice in this book, and over the course of fifteen months, lost 30 inches and completely reshaped my attitude towards fitness. If you read only one book on diet and exercise for the rest of your life--I implore you to choose this one."
4,"A complete, non-boring routine that tones the entire body","Finally an exercise routine that isn't boring and truly gets you fit. Both my husband and I equally enjoy the variety and scope of the exercises. Each set of exercises is broken up by a jump rope segment - and don't underestimate the power of the jump rope! It truly is the most efficient and effective aerobic exercise ever! I completely changed by body shape. I was never overweight, but had fat deposits on my hips and buttocks. Within 2 weeks I lost 4 pounds, but more importantly went from a ""spoon"" shape to a slender,toned,and proportioned body. My husband also lost weight and his muscles are tight and toned. I credit this book for extending our lives and keeping us ""fit for life""! Jackowski may be overly zealous regarding the jumprope, but having tried it, I'd have to agree. It may not be for everyone, but you should give it a try because it works!!"
3,Good common sense advice - but be wary of hype,"This book is oddly structured - it seems to have no organization other than what the author was thinking of at the time. Lots of his tips are good common sense advice and could serve as a wake up call to anyone stuck in a fitness rut.However, the author contradicts himself occasionally (mostly on the effectiveness of certain aerobic workouts like bicycling) and at other times gives outdated advice (he thinks stretching out after a workout is unnecessary). Odd, considering he says earlier in the book that everything in it is ""true.""My recommendation? Read this book like you would take advice from your really athletic friends: Good, common sense, practical advice. Just realize you don't have to accept it, use it, or believe in it all. Use what works and reject the rest."
1,Don't bother!,"There were some good points, but for anyone who knows even the slightest bit about fitness and nutrition, this book just isn't worth the price.I find the author is opinionated, and just ""knows"" he is right about the way YOU should exercise. You haven't lived in my body, and you haven't seen the extraordinary benefits that step aerobics has given me....that would be me, a ""spoon""-shaped woman. (According to the book, since I am ""spoon-shaped"" step aerobics should make my thighs bigger, rather than smaller. It didn't and it hasn't. I've lost INCHES with step aerobics thanks to a couple of videos I've gotten from Amazon.com.)OK, I'll admit There are a couple of good morsels of advice here and there. But honestly, they just aren't worth the price of admisison"
2,slow and uninteresting!,"This was a mistake from my part to have picked such an old fiction/mystery book. The writing was alright but had to really slow my reading to understand it. The style of writing seemed antiquated and dull. I like fast paced reading, keep me intrigued and hooked....I guess part of what the movie and computer, ""my"" generation is about. I just couldn't appreciate the book for what it is and represents to others; Neither could my brother who is a much more avid reader and usually reads anything that he can get his hands on!!! I guess it would be great for young kids (let their imagination fill in) and those who have read from this author before and want to take a trip down memory lane."
2,Hard For Me To Get Through,"This Judy Bolton Mystery is part of a series written by Margaret Sutton. More than five million copies of the Judy Bolton Mysteries were sold between 1932 and 1967. The Vanishing Shadow was based on the tragic bursting of the Austen Dam in 1911. Judy, the main character, often deals with important social issues. This novel is set in Pennsylvania and based on locales in Potter County where Margaret Sutton grew up. The book is written in an old fashioned style that doesn't captivate my interest."
2,A look back in time,"I read Nancy Drew as a child, and enjoyed looking at the characters lives, and how they differed from my own. I guess I didn't notice the stilted language, or the unbelieveable plot lines then, but when I picked up one of the books a few years ago, the stories hadn't aged well. Instead of looking at it as a sweet recollection of times gone by, I was happy things had changed!The Vanishing Shadow falls in that same category for me. The writing just seems old and maudlin. I tried to get through it, but after 5 chapters, just couldn't.Probably a fun trip down memory lane for oldsters, but I can't see much interest for the younger generation."
2,Old fashioned and boring to my tween,"I selected this as a 'vine' product because I thought my daughter - who is an avid reader - would enjoy it. She put it down after approximately 120 pages. I couldn't nag her enough to finish it... she said it was boring.So, I read it. I found it to be quaint and rather old fashioned - as several reviewers cited previously. I also had difficulty getting wrapped into the story. It is not Nancy Drew quality writing. The mystery lacks suspense and intensity.....hence only two stars."
2,The Vanishing Shadow,"The Vanishing Shadow is a Judy Bolton Mystery which is good for fans of Nancy Drew Mysteries.In this story Judy becomes a witness to a crime and must solve the mystery and figure out the crime. The story is for children but you may find that you may need to help answer questions for the children reading this one, as it is a little hard to follow.The Vanishing Shadow is the first book in the Judy Bolton series, originally published in 1932.The series is intended for children ages 9 to 12.I found this one a little hard to complete personally but others may see this as a refreshing read in today's world as it reverts back to the older days. As stated above this was originally published back in 1932.I gave this one 2 stars."
3,A view to the past,"This is the first book in the series, and was originally released in 1932. The setting takes place around 1911 or so, and offers a glimpse of how Americans went about their lives then. It appears that none of the original text has been ""modernized"" or changed. Customs and some meanings of words used in the early 1900s have changed considerably since then, which could make it confusing for young readers not familiar with that era.The story is based on a true event involving a dam that failed, told from the perspective of a 15-year-old girl. The main character goes from being brave to feeling inadequate so fast at times it is confusing. It's a short book and an easy read, with short chapters written in an informal, conversational tone. It truly paints of a picture of a much simpler time in America, and how people dealt with large-scale disasters."
5,Old Fashioned Feminist Mystery,"I was curious to read The Vanishing Shadow, the first in the Judy Bolton series, because the publisher claims that ""Judy is a feminist in the best light -- smart, capable, courageous, nurturing, and always unwavering in her true beliefs -- a perfect role model.""I enjoyed not only the suspense in this book, but also Judy's complex character. Judy is indeed fearless and intelligent. Yet she is also fallible. For example, she dares her meek brother to ride a dangerous horse, and when he takes her up on the dare and ends up lost when the dam breaks and floods the town, she experiences remorse at her rash words.Readers will also learn something about the social life and culture of small-town America in the 1930s.I have included this book in my online Gender Equality Bookstore."
4,Surprising,"This little book surprised me very much. The writing was so vivid, the action so intense, that I was shocked when I realized how long ago it was written.These mysteries are wonderful reading for young adults, and I endorse them highly."
3,Not A Good Book!,I found this book not very useful for a Civil Surveying exam as there are no special problems presented in this book. This book was printed in handwriting that is pretty hard for me to follow.I do not recommend this book as a survey reference book to someone trying to pass a CA survey exam.
1,This is not good music !!!,"These songs are ""covered"" by bands other than the original bands. The music is horrible! It sounds like rejects from American Idol. Don't buy it!"
1,Incomplete,"I got a Secret - This episode is incomplete. It starts halfway through the show on my copy.The $64,000 Challenge - This episode was complete, and it is a pretty good example of an average 50s quiz show.What Are The Odds? - This is diffidently not a game show. It is pretty boring too, but it does present some interesting facts.Dollar a Second - I already had this particular episode on another DVD, but this was by far my favorite thing on this DVD."
1,wrong picture/model number for this item!,"The picture and model number they show for this item is NOT correct - Wiss stopped making the KSR, which is pictured, and substituted the KSRN model, which has a completely different handle - no longer just a right-handed grip, but a ambidextrous one with a small loop on both sides, which is no where near as comfortable to hold. I had to return what they sent, fortunately MSC was very good about taking the return and acknowledging the error - they had not updated thier listing to match the product change."
5,Great color for darker skin,I always find the nude colors too white for my darker skin. This is the perfect compliment to dark skin and is not readily found at salons so I stock up and bring it with me for my manicures. Love it!
4,Good scissor,"I bought this due to limited arm movement. It helps me open packages, so I would recommend this to anyone that has trouble holding and operating a scissor."
3,Zippy scisssors,Not as good as the singer brand. Will bind on thin paper if you rush it. Have not tried it on fabric yet. For what I used it for it was okay.
3,Not that good,"They are not very comfortable to hold, but for crafting they are o.k. I tried to use them for some upholstering material and they were not that good."
3,Paris Hilton Swarowski belly ring,The ring is so adorable and it really sparkles in the sunlight but after about one month of use some of the stones started popping of and already 5 are missing. Just wanted to advise.
4,Quality Mixing Bowl,"This bowl is heavyweight, non skid and has a slight spout that makes pouring easier. It's an excellent bowl to use with a hand mixer.The only downside is the handle is smallish, and the edge is somewhat sharp, which in combo with the weight makes it uncomfortable to lift."
3,A dry and literal translation...,"This is probably my least favorite translation of the I Ching (I have about three others). It is such a dry and literal translation it is almost unusable.Example:""Predominance of the great is when the great or almighty predominate.The ridgepole bending symbolizes weakness at the basis and in outgrowths.""The only reason I keep it is because it is, indeed portable. However, I find myself using it more as a guide for the hexagram numbers, (which I have come to know fairly well) NOT the readings themselves.For what its worth, I have personally found Brian Walker Browne's translation/interpretation to be by far the wisest and most readable version of the I Ching. I never leave home without it."
5,portable I-Ching,"This is a great little book, very portable, for doing I-Ching readings on the run. The only flaw is that it does not explain to you how to generate the hexagrams so you need to know that already.I carry mine in a small drawstring bag with 3 Chinese coins."
4,a very AUSPICIOUS work,"If you don't know what the word AUSPICIOUS means, then you better go find out because this book uses that word A LOT. As for the translation, it's adequate, but I've heard of better translations. The book's a tad bit smaller than a 3 x 5 card, which makes this a TRUE pocketbook. Also, Mr. Cleary mentions how you consult the I Ching based on how you perceive the situation. ""Oh, I feel like this situation is a Wind over Fire situation."" That'll refer you to hexagram 37--People in the Home. This book beats you over the head how it is AUSPICIOUS to ""see great people"" and ""cross great rivers."" It will also tell you if some situations are good luck or bad luck. Overall, this is a pretty decent book of wisdom (I like how your mood depends on what hexagram you get), but I don't think it can compare to the Book of Proverbs which is more to the point. Anyway, give this book a try as there is some good stuff in it."
3,"Not a review, just a heads up....","I was looking for a CD with these great artists, and I see that Amazon has ""The Gods Are in the House"". GREAT! Or so I thought....When I clicked on the CD image (you should do the same), and read the very top line of the CD cover, it stated:""Unique *RECREATIONS* of classic piano recordings reproduced in today's high quality sound.""Now I take ""Recreations"" to mean that someone else is playing these artist's songs, NOT the actual artists themselves - Johnson, Tatum and Waller.I want to hear the ACTUAL artists playing, not someone else's ""recreation"".So if you were thinking of buying this CD to hear these great pianists, I would look elsewhere."
5,Can't Stop Dreaming Album,"Not only one of Daryl and company best album but one of the best sound tracks I've heard in years. The songs and instruments by Daryl Hall and musicians is outstanding. A very talented musician in his own right, Daryl is an accomplished singer, Not many left in this world. Great buy."
5,Daryl is the KIng,"Though a long time H&O fan, after hearing this album I can say that a Daryl Hall solo album takes the cake every time, but mostly with Cant Stop Dreaming. The tracks "" Cab Driver "" and "" Whats in your world "" are so moving that I could put them on an endless loop and never tire of them. Daryls voice has actually gotten better, or at least he has learned to use what he has more to his advantage. SO glad to see the yelling of the 80's gone, so now he is back to TRUE soul. Stop reading this and buy it. You will not be dissapointed!"
4,Can't stop Dreamin,"This is classic Daryl Hall! The vocals are superb and the band is real tight! This CD shows a maturity with his song writing. The first time I listened to it, the music sounded a little wussy to me, but as I continued to listen I started to understand the direction Daryl was going and the sound he was trying to convey.This CD is not for you fly by night Hall & Oates fan! But I would strongly recommend it for the folks that have been on the band wagon since the beginning."
4,Daryl Hall's 2nd Best Solo Album!,"After ""Soul Alone"" it was always going to be tough to come up with another album to top it although this album does come close. A little more subdued and less cohesive although the sound quality is quite good. Unlike ""Soul Alone"" where most of the tracks are excellent, there are some fillers here and remakes of previous material like ""She's Gone"" and ""Something About You"" but there are a couple of strong tracks as well. My favourite is ""Justify"" although ""Cab Driver"" and ""Fools Rush In"" are quite strong as well. Overall a decent offering but not as good as ""Soul Alone."" As I got my copy as a gift from a friend, as good as this album is, I'm not sure if the hefty price tag justifies this purchase though to be very honest I probably wouldn't pay that much for this album myself."
5,Deeply Moving!!,"This is a rather mellow and deep Daryl Hall work. The standout numbers are ""Let Me Be The One"" which is very moving and soulful. ""Cab Driver"" could have been a hit on pop stations, jazz stations, and R&B; stations if only it had been promoted and/or played. ""Never Let Me Go"" with its driving rhythms draws you right inside. ""Fools Rush In"" with its complex arrangement has something very special to offer.For all Daryl fans, this cd has great standout songs and other more mellow songs that you will love."
3,"Good Album, but not Daryl's Best work","Let me start with the following disclaimer... I'VE BEEN A HUGE HALL & OATES FAN SINCE I WAS A KID, 30 SOMETHING YEARS AGO.I've also seen them in concert 4 times... So far.That said, here's my short and honest review: Can't Stop Dreaming is a good album, but not Daryl's Best work.It is a must for any true Hall and Oates fan to have in their collection, but I can't qualify it as a favoirite. In contrast, I should also point out that a song called, ""Let Me Be The One"" is my favorite song from this album and I can listen to that tune over an over again. In fact, I have.In my humble opinion, Soul Alone is a much better album. Then again, the styles on the albums are different and it could just be a matter of perosnal preference? After all, I this is just my opinion.If you're truly an intersted fan, you should do what I did... Buy both albums and then see what you think."
5,Still putting out great music...,Daryl Hall is one of the best artists to ever come out of the Philly area and his talent has not skipped a beat with this CD. This is one CD that you can play from start to finish without the need to skip a song. Every song is a hit in my book. It will always have a spot in my CD player in my car.
5,Perfection,"I judge a disc by how many cuts I will place on my own compilation disc. With ""Can't Stop Dreaming"" the answer was that I didn't need to make my own disc! Every single cut on this disc is strong and it is a complete rhythm and blues opus all by itself. Can't Stop Dreaming is a brilliant tour though the Hall and Oates songbook but amazingly with only one cover (""She's Gone)."" But you will hear shades of every hit H & O has had in these new songs. The blue-eyed soul sound of Philadelphia is alive and groovin'.Buy and enjoy!"
4,GRILLE COVER,"LOVE THE LOOK OF IT, HEAVIER MATERIAL. 1 NEGATIVE- IT DOES SIT OUTSIDE AND HAS WEATHERED SOONER THAN I EXPECTED, CHECKED AND CRACKING"
4,Prisoners of Fear,This is a thriller. The story has been told in a gripping format. The use of the diaries of the killer and actual court records recreated the fear that Connie experienced. This is easy to read and the court scenes are real.
1,A LIE,"This book is about my family and it's nothing but lies, who ever buys this book should look to them selves in shame, because none of it is true!!!"
5,"Liquid Dreams . . . a hot, spicy read!","This was a great book. Liquid Dreams gives readers a look into the lives of four women who allow their lust and greed for money to control their existence. By any means necessary, these young women give up their body and souls for the finer things in life. Yet, as they dance with the devil chasing the benjamins and trying to be ghetto-fabulous, their lives begin to unravel and they soon realize that beneath the glitz and glamour, the one thing they all truly desire doesn't come with a price-tag. Unfortunately, none of them realize it until their dreams to keep sh*t liquid turn into living nightmares. And the snares they have used to trap their prey become the same devices that entrap them . . .From beginning to end, Liquid Dreams kept me wanting more. Congrats Tiffany A. Womble for a job well-done."
2,It was Aight...,"I always like to support black writers especially from Baltimore, but this book could have been better. It jump from here to there with no head or tail. I enjoyed the way she name specific places and events in Baltimore. I hope the second be much better than the first. But I give Ms. Womble much credit and support for being able to sit down and dedicate herself and talent to bring about a book for me to read!"
4,good buy,I would repurchase when needed. Good quality workmanship and design. reasonably priced. I would recommend for others to consider adding it to their tool shed!
1,This is a fake,"This is NOT a real Technomarine. It is a fake, probably made in China. Complete rip-off."
3,Question,The image shows a Leman Russ battle tank while the description says the boxed set has a sentinel. What does this set actually come with?
2,Methinks she doth protest too much,"Though this book contains some tried and true science behind its theories, the main message seemed to be ""if you can relax and your childbirth will be basically painless."" This might be true for some women, but I don't believe this is true for the vast majority. Even with training and preparation, relaxation is helpful, but does not eliminate the pain. I found it somewhat condescending that the author seems to think women are doing something wrong if they have a painful birth process."
1,without fear for a man waching the birth!!!!,I get sick to my stomach when men give their opinion when they have no right to do to so. Give me your opinion when you experience it firsthand which is NEVER.
5,It's about the ideas...,"I have to admit that there were times that this book made me giggle simply because its age dates it and there were times that I felt that he was far too repetitive. That said, however, the ideas in this book are incredibly powerful. I was one of those people who wanted a natural birth but didn't want to spend a lot of money on classes and didn't get around to practicing much with the exercizes we learned in the hospital lamaze class (or the ones in this book, for that matter). It was the ideas in this book, in particular those concerning the fear-tension-pain cycle, that got me through what turned out to be an easy, unmedicated birth. I am firmly convinced that it was the relaxation that Dr. Dick-Reed recommended that made my labor both relatively easy and quick."
5,In-depth study of how birth really works and how to have a good birth experience.,"This book is a bit dense and took me a while to get through, but I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge because of it. The one thing that the doctor keeps repeating is that the key to a successful birth is relaxation and trusting in your body's natural abilities. If you have the time, do read this book, but if you need a shorter version, try Laura Shanley's Unassisted Childbirth. It really applies to any kind of non-doctor birthing, and includes all of the major points Dick-Read stresses."
4,This book is a must read for All Pre-med students.,"There will be readers among you who will struggle with the language and ""dated-ness"" of Grantly Dick Reads book, Childbirth without Fear. However, his work illuminates completely why some women experience ""Pain during childbirth"" and others clearly do not. What is most compelling for me was he clearly took to heart and made it his business as a physician and man of science to understand more deeply the physiological process of birth."
5,Classic book on natural childbirth,"This is the classic book that introduced modern women to the concept of natural childbirth, and to the idea that childbirth does not have to be ""scary"" or ""too painful to bear."" Thank you, Grantly Dick-Read!"
1,Really Really Bad,Whoa just wanted to see how bad it was and OMG. Worst Money ever spent Wouldn't even take this if it was given away for free. The DVD has a mascot which is a girl with cat ears and a tail. The voice over for it is really really bad. The tutorial is so dumb. It draws a circle and then says use the eraser tool to erase the extra lines. Then it says go over the line again to make it darker than the rest. I was like holy crap. Also the music that is playing keeps cutting in and out every single second. I'm not exaggerating. Just got mine and I'm gonna sell it no one will probably buy it though. Also this tutorial isn't even a tutorial it dosnt explain a thing. I know from the tools they were using Photoshop but still this really is the worst thing i have ever seen in my life.
3,Probing Deep Space,"I had to read this book for a science report and i found this book very interesting! It included alot of information about Galileo's Ladder, A short history of Long Telescopes, and even includes a Chronology. Even though it was interesting I would not reccomend buying it, It is redicilously priced and only contains about 100 pages~ So what i have to say is, Check it out from a Library but dont buy it, unless you just need it for your job. Oh yea, dont read it for a science report, its too tough to read for something that probably wont even count for in the long run!<3 Katie"
1,Waiting for substance,Ms Lamb seems to have very little understanding of the complex melee that makes up Pakistan. Her observations are superficial and generally lacking great insight. She starts with preconcieved biases and nowhere in the book does she try and test these preconceptions. This is a truly disappointing book given the amount of time the correspondent has spent in the region.
3,Been Disappointed,"I am a huge Planet Smasher fans and have really enjoyed some of their earlier work like their self titled debut and Life of the Party. I think they are one of the best ska bands out there and they have, for the most part, an excellent discography. I have tried to like Unstoppable and find a few songs to be pretty good and there aren't any real stinkers, but this album doesn't really shine. Where are the funny cheeky songs? Where is the tight ska riffs? It seems like they have tried to progress, but left some of the best part of the Planet Smasher behind.If you are a ska fan would recommend starting from the beginning and working forward with these guys: Plant Smasher, Attack of the Planet Smasher and Life of the Party are all world class ska albums."
1,Don't buy it quite yet...,"If you came upon this movie looking for the next disturbing, macabre, b-fest horror flick, full of grisly gore and astonishing images don't buy this movie. If you want that, go buy Cannibal Holocaust, it's worth the money. If however, you're looking for a movie with one good death scene, HBO type soft-core sex, and terrible subtitles, then buy the film right now."
1,Movie Review,"The Movie is a Japanese produced, Grade D, low budget piece of trash. Some nudity, and violence, but most of it was off camera. Don't waste your time."
1,xxx WaRNING TO FUTURE VIEWERS: Grotesque and gory porno xxx,"I viewed this not knowing what to expect. This is just a warning to anyone who hasn't seen it and who feels they will in the future. This was probably the most disturbingly gory and graphic film I had ever seen. Worse than I spit on your grave, last house on the left and Audition put together, and I found all of the above slightly disturbing. The gore is extreme(ala girls getting killed by penetration, and worse). I'm not spoiling the film for you but there are some scenes, apart from the sex scenes, the rape, and the deaths, that were uncomfortable(a girl being humiliated). Aside from me telling you how gross it was, let me say it was cheap, sleazy, sometimes laughable and a fun slasher film if one is into gore and soft-core porn lol."
5,excellent book on digital technology and microprocessor,"I had the opportunity to go through the copy of the third edition of the book entitled"" Fundamentals of Digital logic and microcomputer design"" by profesor. M. Rafiquzzaman. This edition definately contains more up to date information than the earlier edition. This edition has several unique features. I like the inclusion of definations of ASIC, FPGA/CPLD, CISC/RISC, SDRAM, Flash memories, more examples, and appendices containing details of instruction sets and specifications of Intel and Motorola microprocessors. The book emphasizes on the basics relating them to contemporary and popular microprocessors.i also like the fact that the author included guidelines for the minimum courses to be taken by electrical and computer engineers before graduation to strengthen teir digital background. I highly recommend this book."
5,Lost premium fishing line,I have used several type and lb weight lines from Suffix. All have performed exceptionally for all applications.Very durable and meets or exceeds poundage rating.
3,Not So Personal,"Gary Wills has produced a follow-up to his previous rant about the papacy, Papal Sin, which I read. This volume finds the angry author even more defensive about his 2,000 year quibble with the papacy. His point seems to be that the Catholic Church went badly astray when it started making grandiose claims for the papacy, two in particular: (1) that Church and papal teaching is unchanging; (2) that the pope is infallible.He recycles the arguments from the earlier book throughout most of ""Why,"" focusing obsessively on popes.Wills seems to have set out to create a highly personal apologia of his fidelity to Catholicism, but in the end he can't do it. The book remains a stiffly repetitious and scholarly diatribe revealing almost nothing of the inner Wills, except that he REALLY likes Chesterton, prays the rosary daily, and wouldn't give you a plug nickel for 90% of the popes."
2,Why he is not Catholic,Will's seems obsessed with proving he belongs to a Church he apparently despises and whose doctrines he largely rejects. I see no love here. The only thing he proves is that he is not Catholic.
1,Why I am a Heretic?,"This should be the true title of this book. In Gary Wills book his lack of history, reason and the true nature of the papacy are evident to anyone who is not come with a anti-catholic bias. Wills contends that he is a catholic but by even 21st Century standards her is a true heretic in every sense of the word. His only purpose in writing the book is obviuosly to show how much he hates catolicism and is upset that it is not a democracy that allows you to take the pill, have an abortion or get a divorce. He fails to mention that the church has never changed its teaching on faith or morals on any teaching despite how bad or weak a pope may have been in 2000 years. Anyway, like others I bought the book because the title seemed to be a positive one, like many I was tricked into reading a sad account of personal gripes from another ""cafeteria"" catholic."
2,What is a Pirine Charism?,"Mr. Wills is notably well read and educated. Unfortunately, for someone like myself who is brought up in a highly ""superstitious"" Catholic upbringing.This book proved to be too scholastic for me. Mr. Wills brought out terms and references within the faith which I need to constantly look up from the web.I've read Cathecism of the Catholic church and the History of Christianity but those books were just side notes compared to what Mr. Wills is trying to say.It's just not a good read, as I find it extremely hard to understand. I would have hoped that there's a disclaimer somewhere saying, please read a Beginners Guide to Catholism, or History of Catholism first before attempting to read this book."
1,Bourgeois Brat,"Mr. Wills is at best a scribbler at worst a demagogue, and he is writing for a public that is moved by demagoguery.If anyone doubts that much of the North American Church is already in schism with Rome, let him read this book.Little Gary comes across as a self-satisfied, middle-aged brat."
1,Ridicolous.,"Please, gimme a break. I can't believe people can treat Will's writings seriously. The ONLY reason, he gets press is because he bashes the Church. People don't like the Church, because they do not like its moral teachings and authority. Modern, popular culture doesn't like the moral teachings and authority of the Church, because they lack the moral backbone to strive for the virtuous life.So, for all his pomp and bravado, Wills, like many others are merely justifying their immorality. Hardly what I would call a noble enterprise."
2,Drowning voices,"The soloist's voice is clear, but the chorus is murky, and the SATB parts are difficult to make out in some stretches."
5,Excellent Book,"Rick ""Night Train"" Blaine is a top-notch blackjack player and an excellent writer. He's combined the two skills to create a book that is user friendly, extremely informative, and totally beneficial for seasoned players as well as beginners. Besides serving as a terrific primer for anyone who wants to learn how to count cards, Blaine's book is loaded with illuminating tips and anecdotes from inside the world that inspired Bringing Down The House. Prior to reading Blackjack Blueprint, I was pretty much of a blackjack sucker. After reading it and implementing Blaine's strategies -- as I recently explained in the pages of Cigar Aficionado magazine -- I became good enough to get backed-off in a Vegas casino. And, as every blackjack pro knows, when they don't want you to play, you're doing something right. This book is the real deal. Read it and make a pit-boss weep."
4,Something for everyone,"I've read several books on Blackjack, as that is the only game I enjoy at the casinos. This one definitely added to my knowledge. Seems like it has something for all levels of players. I particularly liked the list of things that inexperienced counters do (but shouldn't). I found that I do most of them (sigh). Knowing this now should help me to advance my game and cover. The sections on team play weren't relevant to me, but still interesting reading."
3,"Decent, but not amazing results","Decent, but in-play experience proves his strategies are not as solid as you might think. After trying his basic strategies in casinos, I found fairly poor results. Perhaps someone who spends more time learning the advanced techniques would benefit more. A good book with good strategies though."
4,Gives me good information,The book presents the basic skill of card counting very clearly and it included many useful drills to sharpen the readers' skill. However in the latter part of the book it dwelled too much on building a team for professional play.
1,Nice product but one problem,"I purchased this item on December 30 for $17.99 plus $5.00 off promotion ($5 Offer on Bath & Gift Sets).In general, it is a quality product held by a wooden tray with instructions on the back.Be forewarned, there is one BIG problem. Even though it was well packaged, the large massage oil bottle was broken and leaked throughout the box. I'm assuming that this is not an isolated issue because of the fragile nature of the contents.In conclusion, even though this is a good product, I would NOT purchase this item due the delicate bottles breaking during shipping."
5,Perfect Gift,"I ordered this set for my mother for Christmas and she absolutely loves it! Everything arrived in excellent condition without the slightest hint of damage. I guess that is all in how the package is handled by those packing and delivering it. So, while it is certainly a good idea to take the fragile nature of ANY product into account before ordering, don't let one bad incident discourage you."
5,5 stars for the best 2nd I've ever heard,"Forget about Barbirolli's Third--there are many, many superior recorded performances.Do, however, grab this for his 2nd. It's absolutely amazing, with stunning playing the Vienna Phil. Everything is perfect--it's all sunny and warm, expressive and light-hearted where needed, passionate when called for. It was all just right. The recorded sound is fine, not amazing. But with such great music-making...sigh. Brahms, Barbirolli and Vienna at their considerable best."
3,Already Disappointed,"I must say that from reading the reviews and advertising for the game that Im already disappointed even though I havent played the expansion. Most of the 'features' could, and have, been done already. Anyone who has played the fantastic 'Test of Time' map will know what I mean (Im not sure where I got it from originally, I think its a free download, try google). The Civ 3 Test of Time map has many new civilizations, including Incas, Israelis, Songhai and Tibetans. The map also has features mentioned in the advertising for this expansion, such as tobacco as a trade good. The new city specialists and government types might make things a bit different, but I dont think Ill bother."
4,good game,"Um, Felini this game isn't a RTS it's a turn based strategy, and like most TBS the games do take a long time to finish, but it's a pretty fun game. I'm in the beta right now and it is definatly worth picking up on oct 28."
4,"Awesome, Addictive & FUN!","This Game ROCKS!!! I spend almost all of my spare time playing this game, there are some bugs and annoying little things, but it's got good graphics and replayability is very, very High! The civilization variety is good, the map style variety is good, the Conquests are pretty cool. Did I mention good graphics? The AI is ok, but then again, I've only played on the two easiest out of Eight different difficulty levels. You can spend a lot of time playing this game."
1,Wow!,"Who thought that Civilization 3 could get any better after Play The World? With the conquests expansin, computer games are taken to a whole new level. Its almost too realistic. Its imposible to imagine how so much alterenatives of how to play a game you have in only one."
1,HUMAN SACRIFICE is NOT ok for 6 year olds,"A great, classic game series has joined GTA in the moral sewer.I hope everyone will demand a replacement without this.If murder - even fantasy murder - can win a game, that game is not fit to sell.In contrast, Civ III had reached new moral heights for the series by capturing workers rather than executing them like many other games.I was a real fan since the original CIV.I never admired any nation that practised mass murder; why do they think any civilization would? Please keep this out of the reach of children."
5,I love this expansion pack,"The new civilizations alone make this worth the price in my mind but add in all the new governments, the new civilization characteristics are all great too.But the new and improved Espionage interface it is worth its weight in gold.The advisor window for cities can now be sorted by any column including what the city is producing is great. And last but not least the Histograph is replaced by a much better interface as well.If you love the game the way I do you will love this expansion."
1,HORRIBLE,"Sorry I didn't check here before purchasing. This book is awful. Even the answer keys were incorrect, and some sections don't have answer keys at all. I am going to return this book too."
4,Witness: Voices from the Holocaust,"Witness: Voices from the Holocaust gives a very detailed account of the Holocsust, beginning in the early 1930's of Europe. Twenty-seven individuals are interviewed in the first person. Jews, Gentiles, Hitler Youth, priests, and others tell their story of their life and memories during these years. I found the book to be very educational and informative. It is not too graphic even though it does give you a very realistic view of life as it was when Hitler was controlling Germany."
4,emotional but excellent read!,"This book is one that drew me in! I really enjoyed this book, from beginning to end. It covers many young people, their struggles from the beginning from the war to their end-either by their release or their untimely demise by nazi soldiers. The story gives many perspectives, with photos, and gives other information (the individuals' stories do not end at the finish of a sentence) This book did make me tear up from time to time, so you may need a box of tissues, but its hard not to get attached to the writers of this trip back into the genicide of WW2."
4,"If you loved ""Ring of Bright Water"", you'll love this book.","Margaret Leigh's delightful book decribes crofting life in thecoastal Scottish highlands during WWII. Amid great privation and bone wearying effort, she transports you to a landscape and a life so magical you will ache to be there with her. An anthem of courage and fortitude from a single middle-aged woman with poetry in her soul. My 88 year old neighbor is having me order several copies for friends."
1,A waste of $$$,VICTORY IN THE GULF is a British video & appears to be an episode of a TV series. It is only one hour long & only the last 10 minutes are devoted to the war. The remainder is concerned with the historical background & with footage of British ground forces mucking about. Totally weak ! ! Not even worth the $2.98 postage charge.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Mine crashed after about a year and 1/2 for no apparent reason and support from Acomdata. They told me to go after the store who sold it to me. I have another Acomdata that has yet to crash and I am throwing in the trash just in case. There are too many similar products in both price and specification to take a chance on this very poor product.
3,"Great for PC, not for Mac","I bought this item over Christmas and had problems booting it up from the start. I had to reboot my iMac into Windows to reformat it and then reformat it again under Mac OSX so Mac OSX would not recognize it. After I reformatted it, the performance was sketchy at best. Sometimes my iMac would recognize it and sometimes it would not. Huge disappointment and it's too late to return it. No problems under PC though."
1,Poor quality - failed after 1 year,Guess I can join the club of failed acomdata drives - used this 250GB hard drive for backups only about every 3-4 weeks so only turned it on and used it 15 times max and now it is dead with nothing but clicking sound and Windows unable to recognize. Junk.
1,it was a short life,"Worked great for about one year (just past the warranty) then died. No warning, just didn't mount one day. Tried it on other computers: nothing. AcomData did not reply to my tech support request."
3,It's Okay,"Great workout, but some of the moves were awkward even at 23 weeks. Needs a little more relaxation at the end."
5,Excellent product!,"If you want a large shopping cart this is it. When they say jumbo they mean Jumbo. It's a lot larger than I needed but who knew? Now that I have it I find that I can fill all the space. I primarily use it to haul groceries from my car to my kitchen since I injured my knee carrying heavy large canvas bags filled with groceries (I never use plastic bags) and I can fit 4 large canvas bags in the cart and still have room left over. It's easy to wheel around, sturdy, yet lightweight and well-made. It folds so it can stand up against my garage wall without taking space.I also use it to haul trash bags to the curb. This was a smart purchase. The company is a good one giving prompt service and on-time delivery."
1,"Again, this is not Narita Trading's cart","DON'T FALL FOR IT!!!This dishonset supplier posted picture of Narita's cart and said it's from Narita Trading, ButTHEY ARE NOT FROM NARITA TRADING.Click on the link and you will go to a company call ""superbuyz"".If the product was good, why do you have to use some other company's name????"
3,Except for the smell of the wheels....,"Don't know how to rate something that seems to have only one major flaw (for me). It looked sturdy enough, it looked large enough but....and a big ""but""....the smell of the tires was overwhelming (to me). Rubber in its purest form. I never took it out of the box. One whiff of the tires and it had to go back. So....if you don't worry about smells....it's something to consider. Otherwise...."
5,Why we purchased this item,"Perfet for us oldsters to take our grorceries from the car into our condo.It is always in our autos trunk, ready to use."
2,Not a Happy camper,"Arrived later than originally promised. Cart had only 3 wheels, and was rickety and loose on sides. Not same item as pictured in ad. had to return."
4,not a singer....,"I love Tommy's playing. He does ok with the singing, but just ok. I'd personally like the cd better if he had only one song on it with singing. Tommy...play brother, play.Other wise a 5 star disc"
5,Outstanding to say the least....,"This new album of Tommy's is well worth the wait since his last release ""Only"", which is a beautiful CD. The musical range is wide on this new release and Tommy is in his finest form with both techinque and musical interpretation. If you're a fan of fingerpicking style, this is one you don't want to pass up. If you are a fan of wonderful guitar music, this is a must for your collection. Tommy never ceases to amaze me nor his other fans with his passion and playing. This one of the best hidden secrets of guitar fans and just watch this man in the next few years."
4,Endless Road CD,CD arrived in a few days and was exactly what I wanted. I feel this was a great value. A very easy purchase.
3,Tommy Emmanuel,Tommy's a fantastic guitarist. You have to see him life to appreciate his guitar talent. This is another CD that doesn't do him justice.
3,Endless Road,"T. Emmanuel is an exceptional picker which is evident throughout the Endless Road CD. Unfortunately, the exceptional is sometimes over-shadowed by the inclusion of out of context ramblings, acoustic box drumming, and an unfortunate vocal. Still, there's enough of the T. Emmanuel that we all have come to appreciate to make this a good, marginal effort."
4,Looks Great,"The sword looks awesome only problem is that it's quite heavy and should only be used pretty much for display purposes. But for the low price,you should get it. Espicially if you are a fan of final fantasy...only gave it 4 stars cuz its obviously not battle ready, it's not too sharp and it's way too big. Only buy if you like final fantasy or like how the sword looks."
5,Awesome,The buster sword is an amazing item to own. If you are a FFVII fan then this is definitely a must own item. I suggest it for anyone who loves the Final Fantasy series or loves to collect swords.
5,a masterfull sword,"I was probably the only adult to ever orderone of these items for their 14 year old son.It is a hunk of beautiful edged, professionallydesigned steel. A sword only a Fantasy Busterwould enjoy. It now hangs on the wall asa true reminder of hohoho,merry christmas"
2,"great title, mediocre book","I bought this book expecting to get lots of useful advice regarding building a new home. No such luck. These is very little content that I actually found useful in a practical way.What I would have found useful would have been chapters on each major phase, and explanations about the impact of the many decisoins that have ot be made. Instead I was addled with lots of war stories that somehow didn't seem relevant to my situation.Though I must admit that the book title does ring true, as we are working with both an architect and a builder who prove it out."
1,Sent regular soccer ball--NOT glow in the dark,"I am waiting to hear from ishopper to get a refund or the Glow in the Dark Soccer Ball that I ordered. My granddaughter is having a birthday this weekend and all she really wanted was a Glow in the dark Soccer Ball.....I was not happy with the price, but I wanted to make her day special. I was excited to have the fed-ex deliver my package in time for the bday. Then to my dismay, it is a regular soccer ball that I could have purchased anywhere for $30 less. I am going to think twice before I do anymore orders online..UPDATE-July 10th, I have just received notice that I have been credited for the purchase and shipping for the return of Plain soccer ball. I appreciate the refund, but am still upset that the Glow in the Dark soccer ball is offered, but not available for purchase."
5,Praise the Lord!,"I have enjoyed the writtings of Sandra who is a dear Christian friend, and this is from my heart!She touches all of the realms of Sprituality. Her writtings consist of the true meaning of God's Word, and touches your soul!She has been a blessing to me in the ""MorningGlory Thoughts"". This is a daily devotion for me.Singing Loudly as Lions Roar is one of her greatest books.I can read it over and over again, and always refer back to it!Everything she writes is touching on God and our Spiritual outlook!Thanks Sandra, and May God always bless you, and your Ministry!"
2,Some good ideas...Very Christian in Orientation,"This book has some wonderful projects and ideas. It is definitely directed at a Christian perspective, which is not clear from the information on this Amazon page! Aside from this fact, the book has some very nice ideas and is well-laid out. I wish I had known before I bought the book how heavily religious the projects are."
5,Review of movie Contact,"One of my favorite, if not most favorite sci-Fi movies . The opening sequence is extremely well done, really drives the imagination. My wife showed it to her high school students as part of their art project, and even high school girls also really loved it. I think Jodie Foster gave them some inspiration for their own future achievements ."
5,HELLO WORLD is right.. this is one GREAT RECORD!,"I was blown away by the video of the song ""If I..."" on the ""Crash"" movie dvd but after hearing this record, ""Hello World"" I am completely convinced that these guys are going to be the best thing in music Hands Down! KANSASCALI you guys should be proud you have a great record this Alternative Hip Hop Rock thing you guys have going on is refreshing."
2,There are better choices...,"Better to just get a chop-style old-fashioned paper cutter. Cutting wheel wobbles, only really cuts 1 sheet at a time. Not a great choice for cutting out inkjet photos. Hard to find replacement blades."
4,Best for editing,"I have Pinnacle Studio Plus Ver. 9 and have downloaded the improvement patch from Pinnacle. I did have Ver 8 and was unhappy with the intermittant crashes in the middle of a project.I have found Ver. 9 (with patch) to be more stable and able to handle detailed editing without any problem. Big feature: you can take a finished DVD project and re-edit directly. No need to save video clips on your hard drive. No problems in rendering and burning, but does take about 3 hours for a 50 min. video. I have been unable to purchase plug-in's directly from Pinnacle. I will not be upgrading to Ver. 10 until all bugs have been corrected."
2,"Um, not quite",The idea of the story is unique and enjoyable. But the writing (dialog especially) felt rushed and not complete enough.
3,"Great book, bad ending","I really enjoyed 99% of this book. And I don't even like Amnesia stories. But the end left something to be desired. It's worth reading, but don't expect much from the ending."
3,This was my first Joan Johnston.,"It was okay...I felt the ending was really rushed. There was such an anti-climactic, abrupt end to such an elaborate story.Blackthorne forgives and forgets Katherine's lies because his daughters want him to? Katherine forgives and forgets Blackthorne's abandonment of her during her pregnancy and childbirth because she doesn't want to part with her son? Very far-fetched and contrived.How could Katherine have even contemplated (for one second) bartering her son for her clan? If I were Blackthorne, I would have dumped her for that reason alone!This was an adequate read, but nothing spectacular."
1,poor seller,"I have made 4 purchases of the gift baskets from Art of Appreciation on Dec. 7th and it happened to turn out that two of the gift baskets were sent without the message cards. I had indicated that a message card must be sent with the baskets and clearly elaborated specific recipients for attention. However, my customers told me that they didn't see the message card and didn't know whose gift baskets were for until I checked with them. I will not make any purchases again with this seller. They make you spend a lot of money but with very poor customer service."
1,What happened to dijon mustard vinaigrette?,"Once upon a time Delouis Fils made a delicious and authentic dijon mustard vinaigrette. I discovered its merits when I purchased the product at Whole Foods. But Whole Foods stopped stocking it, so I went online to search it out. The first time I was able to buy the same product. This time, much to my dismay, I ordered a totally different product although the name is the same. The new dijon mustard vinaigrette is no more French or authentic than any Kraft product. It is glutenous and slightly sweet and--to make a long story short--I threw both bottles out."
3,a tool,"i bought these snips to rough cut plastic laminate. when i got them in the mail and tested them on a scrap piece i thought i had wasted my money. they cracked the material on both sides of the blades. later that night i started tinkering with them. i took em appart sharpened the blades, rounded over the back edges so they could pass through the material easier, adjusted all the screws and sprayed em with a dry lub that i spray my good saw blades and router bits with. they work MUCH better now but they still take some serious concentration and effort to make good cuts. i guess i was dreaming that they would make cutting formica like cutting paper, they don't, but i do like the fack that they are much quiter then a router, don't require any setup, and the don't make dust..."
5,A fantastic archeology of sin & soul...,"This is one of my favorite poetry books of all times. It is sensuous, exact, full of truth and daring honesty. The language pours like streaming sunlight into the dark of a most interesting life. I doubt if Emmanuel can ever top this one! Where do you go from here? It's jazzy & acutely moving..."
1,REPUGNANT AT ALL LEVELS!,I have survived the reading of Hotel Fiesta by Lynn Emanuel I can't believe the sub-standard poetics employed by her in this book. Can American poetry survive after being afflicted by Hotel Fiesta?
5,Nice James Bond type Movies,"In this spy caper supreme we have Connery (little brother to Sean) trying to save the world, just like his big brother always does. Only Neil has his own way of doing things. He plays a plastic surgeon recruited to stop Celi (the bad guys) from world domination! Connery has all the gadgets up his sleeve, and then some! It's non-stop action in the ""Double 007"" tradition!"
4,Like Neko Case?,You will like Kelly Hogan. In a way I am becoming a little bit more... Hmm. Interested in her work. Really fantastic lyrics.
1,It was not the one I wanted - Bad packaging; product was spilling,"I wanted Opalescence, and I received a product without any brand at all. Additionally, the products was not even packed in a box (like Opalescence), so the gel was spilling all over the bag that came packed in.I did not like it at all."
5,A must have 4 all HAIMSTER fans!!!!,"I got this cd about a year ago on ebay for about $5. and I love it!!! I am thrilled to see it going for $150. thats great!!! It just goes to show how much he is still and always will be loved.Rock on COREY HAIM, rock on!!!"
3,"Corey, can you give us more?","I've tried everything known to men and half a turkey .... FINALLY I got hold of Corey's european adventure cd this month. At least, a part of it, because rumour has it that a complete album WAS recorded in Mannheim (Germany) in 1995 but never released.For us Haim-fans this cd-single IS a must-have, but I've rated it only 3 stars, because I think the lyrics and the compositions aren't that special, just average. Next time just let Dianne Warwick or someone like that write the songs, Corey! BUT I agree it is fun to hear Corey sing (the only other time I heard him do that was in the bathtub-scene from Lost Boys), rap too and the picture on the front is VERY nice indeed ... For all you other Haimhuggers out there: I'm gonna try to obtain another cd-single by Corey, called 'See the world', I found out about it on a site dedicated to our hero. So wish me luck ..."
4,good book for the beginner webster and graphic artist,"I just started reading this book and have found alot of useful and easy to understand information about the jpeg & gifs. In the other books about photoshop it was not really explained or shown what the difference looks like. This book is good for understanding photoshop 5.5 web design. In small print on the cover is ImageReady and GoLive. It mostly covers photoshop and designing for the webI am new to design and photoshop. This book is helpful but not ""that"" helpful. If you want to spend the money and need more basic help for the web design buy it it will be helpful. If you are a stud at photoshop and know golive really good don't waste the time to even look at it.This is a good book for the beginner."
2,Disappointed.2,"I was expecting a lot of new information about integration of Photoshop, ImageReady and GoLive, but unfortunately, not much new here. Also,I don't want to buy a book that reads like a journal article. I usually want to be be able to use text books for referencing information."
3,"Is this book about ""web design"" .... ?",This book have only a little bit tutorial using photoshop for web design. Most of the content of the book is mainly about jpeg.. gif compression and all those theory stuff.
4,"Nice, but slim","This silverware is very pretty, but lacks depth. Some of the other reviewers said that it lacks weight or heft. The reason it is lighter is because it is so slim. I used the Reed and Barton hammered silverware at a restaurant and thought that I was purchasing the same item, but this version is not the same. It is really nice, but the slim design takes some getting used to."
1,Not comfortable for small ears,"I have smaller ears and these were very uncomfortable for me. They felt hard when inserted correctly to provide an adequate seal, much prefer the foam ones."
2,Fits OEM RV Water Fill Perfectly; Not worth the money though,"The plastic tether on the oem water fill cap of my motorhome broke from UV. It is white plastic and does not hold up to sunlight. This replacement cap has the same, cheap tether that will ultimately break. For $8, you'd think that it would have a black plastic tether or keychain type chain. At least it will work for a couple of years, but not worth the money."
1,crashed soon after warranty expired,"The drive looks great, worked well until 3 weeks after the one-year warranty expired. No apparent warning - the blue light just started flashing red-blue-red-blue, etc, on and on.Filled out the online form for Acomdata tech support. It states you will get a response within 3 business days. After 4 days, I phoned. Acomdata representative said the warranty is up and there is nothing they will do. He said the part that is not working is not theirs anyway. He suggested that I could open it up and check to see who the manufacturer was and try contacting them - they might have a longer warranty.I have another Acomdata drive - one month until its warranty expires. Yikes!"
1,"Oh, how it died...","I had this drive for about a month before it completely died. It stopped being recognized by Windows, and I wasn't sure if the hard drive itself was bad or the firewire hardware. I opened it up and plugged the drive directly into the IDE and it confirmed it was really dead. Maybe you will have better luck."
4,So far so good,"I am not great at getting ready for ski season. But as I get older I find that I am not able to get away with ""on the slope conditioning"". So this year I decided to try a more structured program. I am six weeks into this one and happy with the results so far. I am doing the basic program.Depending on your conditioning you could probably stand to bump up the cardio on the basic program in the early weeks. I did inadvertently. If I hadn't it would have been way too easy for me and I have fallen pretty far out of cardio shape.I will hopefully get around to doing the advanced program next year."
5,Get Ready for Ski Season,Learn some great exercises to improve your fitness level for skiing. Step-by-step instructions for each exercise are included.
2,"World Cup yes ,,,Joe skier ... a bit much",Some great stuff but I was looking for something more basic for a guy who goes up 25 to 30 times a year and be ready ..this will get you there but I thought it was a bit much for what I wanted ....go for it anyway and good luck ...
2,Where is the suspense,This is the first book I read by Andrei Codrescu. I had a lot of hopes. I enjoyed reading his book until the fifht chapeter or so and all of a sudden my interest dropped. There was no trace of excitement. It seemed to me that the author just wanted to conclude the book rapidly forgetting about his characters. All these new charatcers appeared without any notice.Maybe I should read another book by this author before driving a conclusion about his style?
1,Waste of time!!,"The first two chapters promised to make this an interesting and funny story. However, the book rapidly deteriorates in a diarrhea of words without any real substance. Very boring!"
4,Informative and well-rounded,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was informative, easy to read and a fascinating glimpse at the life of being a musician in this country. The different genres of music represented in this book , from gospel to classical, made it well-rounded as well."
1,"boring, unless you are a black jazz musician","the tunnel vision of this author's writing is amazing. the subtitle is ""what all musicians must know to succeed"" -- that's a bit generous. this book seems to solely focus on a perspective on black jazz music. i couldn't make it through the book. boring as all get-out."
3,a bit confusing to use,the book was a bit confusing to use. I had bought it for my eight year old son so he could pretend to know chinese. He enjoyed looking at it and even attemped to sound some of the words out.It would be a good book to have if you actually knew something about the language
2,How to Formulate & Compound Industrial Detergents,"The book was outdated and it does not help much in formula details for the reader to formulate their own detergents as the title dictates. Yes, compounding the chemical of manufacturers intruduced heavily inside this book profits more than the green horn readers."
3,Good overwiew but really basic,It is a good book that gives a general overview but it is very basic for any scientists or formulators in the home care bussiness
3,"Good value, but needs some kinks worked out.","Have been using this radio for 5 months and have been generally satisfied with all the important stuff: sound quality, functionality, and ease of installation. However, you'll find the suction cupped docking station laying on your dash about once a week. This can't be good for the wiring/connections on the back of the unit. I, too, have had issues with poor reception due to a loose connection on the back of the docking station. Had to put a piece of tape on the back to hold the connector in place. Another issue, if you care about how the radio looks, is that after only 5 months of use, seven of the ten lights behind the tuning buttons have burned out. At night it makes the radio look like a big gap-toothed grin.All in all, a decent value at the rebated/discounted price of $99..but expect some idiosyncrasies like the ones described above."
3,"$13/mth for COMMERCIAL radio - yes, commercials are still there.","The hardware is great and works fine - no problem there. However, if you are switching to satellite radio to get away from commercials you are going to be dissappointed.I listen to about 25 stations on my Sirius service and 22 out of the 25 are commercial radio. Keep in mind there's about 160 channels right now and a lot of the channels are commercial channels. Yes, I'm paying for the service. Yes, I subscribed for access to particular programming. Yes, the shows are uncensored (for now) - that's all great. However, why am I PAYING for commercials??Before you buy anything ask yourself 'WHY DO I WANT TO PAY FOR RADIO? WHAT IS DRIVING ME TO SATELLITE RADIO?' Make your decision based on your answers."
4,Great Radio Great Customer support,"First let me say that I love this radio. Once you get used to the rewind button, you will try to rewind regular radio too. Worth every penny and then some.I don't know what happened with the other reviewers customer service experiance but I called when I had a few problems and they sent me a new reciever that day without question. It doesn't get much better than that."
2,Sirius Sportster,"The radio did not work as shipped. But, I was lucky, my stepson had an additional receiver base, the part that didn't work, so we were able to get the radio working. It is just too big of a hassle to go through returning the product so I was happy about that. This is the first time I have had a problem ordering throgh Amazon. It is tough to get to a real person."
1,These units have a history of failure,"I bought my Sirius Sportster about two months ago. It worked great for a month and a half. Now it does nothing but display ""Acquiring signal"" and it is not an antenna failure or a reception problem as I have tested it on my wife's Sirius setup in her car. If I repeatedly plug it in and unplug it for a few minutes, sometimes it starts to work properly but only for about 5 minutes. I searched the web and I am not alone with this problem. [...]Do not buy this model. It does not last."
1,Never buy a sportster,"Never buy a sportster- I'm on my second and it's horrible. My first worked well for a while and then it kept having trouble ""detacting the antenna"" I would have to jostle the wires until it decided to detact it. So I brought it back to the place I bought it (luckly I bought the extended warranty)- I've had this new one for less than a year and it's doing the same thing- I treat it VERY well- I don't take it in and out of my car- it ust sit there- I love sirius and reccommend it to everyone just DON'T BUT A SPORTSTER."
2,Sirius SP-TK2 Sportster Replay,"I'm not impressed with this radio. The FM transmitter is not that great. I find it very difficult to find a decent free FM station in my area (RI) to tune to, to make this radio work well. I also have a REAL Sirius satellite radio also.. In my opinion, buying a real radio that receives the satellite broadcast and has it's OWN amplifier built in is well worth the investment. I would never buy another one of these radios that transmit to your already installed car stereo."
3,Geting Closer to the end,Paranoia agent is a series with an original concept and very different from anything you'll see out right now. My problem with it is that it seems people are holding back in not saying that there is case after case with people who have brutal encounters with Lil Slugger but when do you start to get closer to finding out why he is doing it and who he is. Maybe I missed an episode but from what I remember the detectives who are trying to figure this case out get close but never close this case and this is in almost every episode. It's a great series but they're not putting in the right elements to complete the series. You are given a little bit of a lead on Slugger but not enough.
2,"too much, very sloppy selection","This is just a big book of business cards, some good, some bad. I really wonder at the selection process here"
5,a less published but formidable translation,"as always, the package is wonderful. everyman covers are splendid and the pages are fine paper. the translation is less widely available than the grene lattimore or the fagles translations but it is no less masterful. justice is done to this classic."
4,Cincise repair information with clear pictures.,"What I like:Concise description and outline of steps needed for repair.List of tools needed and rating of difficulty.Tips ""block"" on many pages.Clear color pictures.""Extra"" chapters included such as: ""Ten Top Tips"" and ""Silence Unwanted Noises"".Up-to-date, i.e. includes V-brakes and other current components.What I don't like:Some text refers to a picture and it is unclear which picture, or which part is being refered to.There are a few procedures which should have more detail: if you are not used to working on bikes.Other observations:This book was written by a Brit, so you need to know what a spanner is (there are other terms as well, such as ""washing-up liquid).The best book I have worked with to date. Any information not included I can ask my local wrench. I can't give the book a 5 star rating due to the minor items under ""What I don't like"" above."
5,A big help for adrenal fatigue,"I've been taking this product for several years (2 capsules, twice a day) and I could really see an improvement when I first started. Recently I decided to try taking a lower dose, and I could tell I still needed it. I'm glad it's available, since it makes a difference in how I feel! (And Amazon has the best price around.)"
3,review,"I used this once for adrenal stress that crippled me for a couple of months, I started using ashwaghanda root from swansonvitamins and it worked very fast and well"
3,Beechwood biscuits,"These were not as good as I expected. Sure they do fit better than the Porter cable biscuits but it still isn't a snug fit. The only way that I have found that I can get a snug fit is by making it myself. The best biscuit fit that I can get is by soaking the Porter cable biscuits in water for 12 hours, then letting them dry. I tried this with these biscuits but they expanded too much, and there was no way with all the pressure I applied that I was getting them in the slot. They are good biscuits though. I wish the price was cheaper on these. I should also note that I live in a very very dry region."
4,Fancy Packaging,"I bought this in Beige - comes in a very cool Dior blue/gold lipstick case, so I feel pretty fancy everytime I pull this out of my purse to apply. This is a lipstick so any gloss will be shinier any day - this stuff feels thicker & heavier too and has a strong cosmetic taste, like Grandma's lipstick or something. It's sheer and has a hint of glitter/sparkles but I noticed the color eventually settles into liplines/creases - which then you have to dab (and lose the shininess!). I'm more of a lightweight, yummy-flavored type sheer lipgloss fan, so this isn't usually my first pick for lips when I'm fumbling thru my purse. I still love Dior."
4,Great Story of Sharing and Caring,"This story was is great to teach you how a little bit of team work can get you where you want to be. In this story, two mice work together to grow a huge pumpkin, although they didn't know they were helping eachother. Each mouse put everything he had into making the pumpkin grow and be the best. Clayton the house mouse wanted to grow the biggest pumpkin and to win the grand prize at the town pumpkin contest. Desmond the field mouse wants to grow a pumpkin to make into the biggest and best jack-o-lantern ever. They work together and grow a pumplin bigger than their houses.This story teaches you more than one thing. The first is that if you are determined to do something, and put your heart and soal into it, you can do whatever you want to do. In this case, grow a huge pumpkin. The other is that with teamwork, your job gets done faster, and sometimes makes the project easier. This is a very good book , and I recomend it, not just to kids, but to people of every age."
5,Favorite Halloween book,I've been reading this book to my children for years. I recently bought a copy for a relative. The illustrations are fun and the story will appeal to many ages.
2,I didn't love it.,"I love Baby Jane. I love drag queens. Should be a match made in heaven. For me, it wasn't. I turned it off half way through. The decent portrayals kept me interested for a little while, but it started to drag(haha). I just didn't think the inserted ""modern"" jokes were that funny, nor were their caricatures good enough to carry the whole movie. I just didn't see much humor in this. The original film was campier I think! It might have been funny to just do a few scenes from different movies, but it loses its luster when you're reenacting the entire story. The joke wears thin."
5,Side-Splitting!!!,THE best film I watched in YEARS!!!!I cannot wait for the Mommie Dearest version to be made!!!!! Or possibly Gone With The Wind!!!!! THAT would be awesome!GREAT movie folks! Buy it. Buy it. But it!!!
3,A Faithful Homage,"Baby Jane? is a faithful homage/remake to the classic Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?, which starred Bettie Davis and Joan Crawford. But if you ask me, it's a little too faithful. Most of the cast members are men in drag, and there are a few laughs to be had, but I expected this to be funnier and more outrageous. The actors were all great and I especially had fun watching the nosy neighbors. It was just too average, overall."
1,"Only 1 left in stock? Good, leave it there!","This is the worst movie parody that I have ever seen. The guy who plays Jane thinks he is in this for real while the other actors play it the way it should be played, fun and funny. It is sad when one bad (Who thinks he is good) actor can effff up a whole movie when the others in the movie are trying to so hard, but heeeeeeeeeeeeee did!"
4,It's too cool . . .,"Yes, it's totally pointless and silly, but if you're pimping out your box, then the Xray is the equivalent of putting on spinners.That being said, installation is a pain in the neck if you are working with a tool-less case. I'm in the process of fabricating a box for it to marry up with for installation. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are willing and able to do the required work to install the Xray."
2,If you read first half you gotta read this,"and you will be disappointed. A civil war begins, main hero steps up as leader of rebellion, a third side appears in civil war, and lot of stuff gets complicated and little solved, and mood is not even close to adventurous/mystery mood of book one.I couldn't say that this series, 'Long Sun' really ends here, it seems that Short Sun is sequel, but I didn't read it yet.When Wolfe has idea and inspiration, he is best. When not, he is worst."
4,Great Novel,"What a great book, i've thoroughly enjoyed it,It becomes hard to put down when you start reading it, the plot moves fast and the reader is never bored with useless information and attention to details. I love the fact how the fictional events portrayed in the book tie in with actual events of the past century , such as WWI and WWII. The book explores the sorrow of losing loved ones and human emotion and feelings. While at the same time showcases the lifestyles of English and French elite societies, which is used to show that money after all is not the solution to all of life's problems. Sometimes the circuimstances one finds himself are not solved by buying your way out. I would definetely reccommend this book!!"
2,Of limited use,"This phrasebook was of very limited use to me. The selection of Spanish phrases or terms in any given section invariably excluded the very thing I needed to know. Dining: How do I ask for restaurant reservations? Shopping: How do I ask if they have other sizes? Conversion Tables: No US->Europe shoe size chart?The menu guide was an odd collection of words and terms with no pronunciation guide, thanks. Some dishes were given very specific descriptions, others were uselessly generic (empanada gallega and empanada santiaguesa are both just ""fish pie."") Certain specialties of Spain are completely absent -- how is it possible that the words iberico, bellota, and patanegra are nowhere to be found?Mini-dictionary is only English-Spanish, and seems to be randomly selected words, so if you want to know how to ask for something specific, you'd best hope that it has been included in a phrase in the appropriate section."
4,"Fast ship, good price, but not too sturdy",I find these thinner tips do not hold up well & one broke within 2 days. I was doing a LOT of soldering but 2 days?
4,Exactly what this world needs,"Such a wonderful surprise seeing this back in print!! Brimming with the always poignant, rarely stagnant ripostes of the Circus family, ""Daddy's Cap Is on Backwards"" offers stanza after stanza of Twitteresque humor (and has been doing it long before there even was a Twitter, I tell you!)I find this to be one of Master Keane's best titles, and was heartbroken when Fawcett Publishing let the edition lapse into misprint. Fortunately, when I was in Kingston-Upon-Thames for the Millennial, I was able to spot the UK version (""Father's Trilby Is in Arrears""), which indeed helped me through the rather difficult times of twenty-aught-one to aught-nine. Which brings me to the point of this essay. Daddy's Cap is precisely the kind of exquisitely fluffy, soul-hoisting epistle mankind requires today -- it is nothing short of a guide manual for human decency in this post-bin-laden world.Daddy's Cap IS on backwards, I say...and may it never be right-faced!"
4,"""Bone Thugs"" sealed the album","Hearing the first song off the cd ""Power of a smile"" by Bone Thugs, was enought for me to buy the album. This is a well put together song. With there trademark speedy flow, along with their capability to harmonize like a group of RnB singers. But yet they still mantain that tough hardcore rap image. The Bone Thug camp haven't really put out real Quality music in a couple years, but judging this song, I think its say to safe that their back to capture their throme once again. Ludacris and Boot camp Click did an okay job."
1,Mine was bad.,"Most of these cables might work fine but the one I got was bad. The Red channel wire didn't work. I don't know if I was just unlucky or they have poor quality control and a lot of them are bad. I didn't want to wait around for another one to be shipped so I went to the store and had to pay $24.95. At least it was this nice Monster Cable one. Monster GameLink Component video and stereo audio cable for Nintendo Wii Oh and FYI I saw a bunch of reviews talking about this being a digital cable. Component inputs are analog not digital. This cable will not give you HD i.e. 720P, 1080I/P but it will give you ED i.e. 480P compared to the standard 480I which is still an improvement in resolution and you should see an improvement in general picture quality because you don't have all the picture information being crammed together on one wire."
3,Okay cables,"These Wii component cables Work. They are only two problems:1, Color Of the Cables , You cant tell what color is what Tip: They're are two redish ones but look different there is a pattern on the white cables those are the audio cables.2, Only provides 5 cables not 6.The cables work in both 16:9 and 480P i just wished that the setup was easier."
3,Not much difference noticed,"I have a 50"" Phillips plasma and I did not notice much difference. I was expecting to see a difference after changing over the resolution and did not see much. However for the price I would do it again..."
2,Got what I paid for,"Did everything I had to do to set this cable up with the wii system and TV. To be honest, it didn't make that much of an improvment. I have a top of the line plasma tv, should have gotten top of the line cables, I guess. Really don't think that would have made it any bettr either, though. That's just the way it is, unfortunatly."
1,Seller does not send product advertised or respond to email!!,Do not buy anything from this seller (Mycarryingcase). The product listed is composite and s-video cable for Nintento Wii. Seller will send you a component cable and never respond to your attempts to fix the error. The only good thing about this transaction is that it was a cheap error on my part to ever buy anything from this seller and as such it is hardly worth my time to even write this review. At least this may serve as a warning to others thinking about buying more expensive items from this seller. BE CAREFUL - YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!!!!!!!!!
4,It Does the job!,"I needed additional cables because the 3-tip cables that came with my Wii used the same connector on my tv as my DVD player. It was a pain to keep unplugging them & switching back & forth. Plus my tv has HD connections - why not use them. I was afraid of the no-name generic, but for under $5, I'd take a shot. It works - 'nuf said."
4,"Great product, great price!",Great product for $3 instead of $30 from Nintendo. Works perfectly. Just remember to change your video setting on the Wii to take advantage of the composite connection. Fast shipment and terrific price!
5,Amazing quality!,"Initially I bought this to record games on my wii on my pvr, but I couldn't without component cablesBut when I tried it out I was stunned by the new quality, the other reviews here will also tell you the boost this gives. And I saw this very product at gamestop for 15$ so if you want the HD quality and you have the right tv, there's no reason not to buy this."
4,High Definition?,"This cable is definitely a good and cheap alternative to anything you will find in the stores. I'm not quite sure how drastic of an improvement it is over the AV cables, but honestly, who cares for this price."
3,Only 1 Cable Not 2 as Pictured or Described.,"I received this product recently and was surprised to see it only came with 1 CABLE.The bulk packaging I received weighs 7 oz NOT 3 lbs. (I weighed the package on my postal scale since I am a online seller I thought since the description said 3 lbs there would be 2 Cables. WRONG)The contacts are NOT GOLD AS STATED in the description they are silver tone metal.If I knew it was only for 1 cable I would have looked somewhere else since I have multiple consoles.Descriptions need to be accurate, for the buyer sake! It is very unfair that I didn't get what I thought I was going to receive.The seller needs to be more specific about this item for the simple fact that it is not true, dimension wise the cable is 5 ft 10 inches long.Not happy. Live and learn!"
3,Its okay,"Got these awhile back. They work. But I notice that when I use these it adds some artifacts to the screen at time. Actually this is when. Say you are at a title screen, when you hit enter to start up the game. The title has little artifacts. I noticed this on a pair of madcatz wires I had too though"
4,Could be a redundant purchase,"Soon after getting my Wii, started thinking about replacing the factory cable with the high resolution version. On my 60"" Sony, the picture was terrible with my original setup. About a month later I replaced my receiver with a newer version that does up-scaling of any source to HDMI 1080p. The improvement in the picture was amazing. I then wondered how much better it could get.So I purchased the High Resolution component cable. There is some minor improvement, but nothing really to write home about. From 8 feet away the picture looks just as sharp as the factory cable with the up-scaling receiver. Just for kicks, I hooked it all up using my original receiver and I was amazed at how much better the picture was than with the factory cable.Basically, if your receiver can perform up-scaling, you won't find much use for the High Resolution Wii component cable. If you don't use a receiver or have an older one, then this is the product for you."
3,Not bad for the price,"The cables feel solid. The colors are different from the picture shown. They have a cm wide stripe showing the colors. It might be confusing when you look at them tangled. It is easily noticeable, as the audio cables are together on one side. Once in a while, there is like snow, or static. They are more like lines, or distortion. I noticed that the longer I play a game, Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword for example, the more occurrences of the distortion happens. Colors definitely seem to have brightened and edges are more smoother. Overall this is not a bad item to get if you want some improvement with a small budget."
4,Why is Amazon asking if this is the game? Hmm,"Well, for under $10, Composite sounds nice, and it seems nice..(since once you have HDTV, you want everything HD)but is it just me or when the screen is blank, it shows lots of noise on TV..When game screen's on, overall, i'm satisfied, but either when it's loading or pre-game screen, it shows lots of 'dust-looking' noise on TV.Other than that..it's all good."
4,Adequate... or excellent if you consider the price!,"Hey, at $5... the cables work, they let me play Last Story w/ legible text on my 46"" LCD. I do see some wavy artifacts when the screen is all black or all white, but as many have written, at this price you can't ask for too much!"
4,Worked like it should,I bought these for my wii on my new HDTV so it would at least look decent enough to play on the TV. It actually increased the clarity of the picture more than I expected. Keep in mind that this is NOT high-definition but actually 480p (HD is 720p/1080p and up) so it will still look a bit blurry up close on tv's that support HD
5,sick! works great,"this works great for the pricw i got it for. a must buy, i used to work at radioshack and all the cables are the same, if you buy one for 40 dollars, it will be the same thing for only less than 10 dollars.buy!!!!!!"
4,Very good price and quality,The cables are in very good quality. I noticed a little improvement from 480i to 480p. The price is extremely good. I am glad I didn't get the Nintendo one from the store.
4,Sensationally wicked masterpiece!,"A best-seller in its day, Quaker City is a violent and surreal look at the life of the citizens of Philadelphia in the 1840s. Anyone who likes Edgar Allen Poe or the Marquis de Sade will find this an interesting read; written off by critics as blatantly pulp, before such a term existed, they considered its mass appeal a sign of weakness, and by 1900, it had vanished from most lists of important American novels. I'm glad that critics are reconsidering its position, and I look forward to more of Lippard's novels coming back to print. Devil-bug, the mastermind of evil, is a great villain, and he looks ahead to Jarry's Pere Ubu, Faulkner's Popeye and many of the great surreal or superreal villains of the twentieth century."
5,The Torah The Five Books of Moses,Purchased this book to see the differences between this translations and the King James translation. It is written in a manner that makes for an easy read.
2,Doesn't fit in my pocket,"Hi,This pocket book is not going to fit in our pocket unless you have cargo pants with large side pockets. This book is about 3 or 4 times the size of a new testament pocket book.Thanks. God Bless.Aaron."
4,Sargent print,"The poster arrived in a timely fashion, and was packaged well. I would certainly do business with this company again. That said, I found the colors to be a bit dull. Still, in a frame and hanging on the wall, I am satisfied and it just may be that a print can never do the original painting, which I have seen in person, justice."
3,Not a Quality Reproduction,"The print arrived today. It was well packaged and printed on high-quality paper, but the colors were so washed out and dull that the picture was barely distinguishable. I won't be ordering more prints in the future."
5,Where do we go from here?,"Anyone living in America has experienced firsthand the short-term changes caused by the terrorist attacks of 9/11. But what about the longer-term changes? What can we expect, and how will it affect our lives? Betting on America offers a lucid, thoughtful scenario of life in the months, and years ahead. The authors include a historic perspective in showing us how we can individually, and collectively, become stronger, more secure, in dealing with the future. America has always had a strong resolve; Messrs Cortada and Wakin help us understand why. A must buy book for anyone interested in knowing where we go from here."
5,Wordsworth got plenty to say,"I have been waiting a very longtime for this debut, and I can say hands down that I have been completely blown away by his focus through the whole entire album. From start to finish words takes us through his mind, heart, and mainly his soul. You will not need to buy another album for months. His rhyme scheme is unmatched..."
3,Quantity over quality,"This album could of been stripped down to 5 tracks which in my opinion makes this album only 25% complete. ""Right Now"", ""What We Gon Do"", ""Head High"", ""Guardian Angel"" and ""On Your Feet"" are the only hot tracks. The rest is a mixture of similarly sounding soft-ish tracks which really have no place on this album.As an old school Wordsworth fan it's nice to see him come out with some gear that hasnt be made on a 1970s tape deck and mic but been produced properly and professionally.Disapointed is the feeling you're left after hearing this album, which is bad because it's an almost great album. Less lovey dovey rubbish mang."
1,What?,"Why is this show still on TV? This show was never good. It's nothing but a gay themed Ally McBeal / Boston Public. How could anyone actually think that this is some kind of icon for gay ""culture"".I could really rant about this so-called ""fascinating drama"" for hours but I'll cut it short. Queer As Folk is just another cliché piece of overrated soft-core Show Time porn. There is absolutely no creativity what so ever. I mean, wow, gay men who club, have lots of sex, and soap opera relationships, how did they ever think that up?It just proves that if you put enough sex in a TV show, a lot of people will watch it and think that it's artwork."
3,Too Short..,"I loved Seasons One and Two but Season Three was far from exciting. It had it's good moments. I loved the conflict between Brian and Stockwell and the Michael/Ben/Hunter dynamic. And I also enjoyed the focus on the drama instead of the sex but it wasn't as captivating.I hated that they had broken-up Ethan and Justin. It didn't fit how they broke them up. Ethan had way too much passion and love for Justin just to go out and cheat on him. It was all to get the ""golden couple"" Brian and Justin back together. I am not big fan of that couple to begin with. So I didn't like that. I also wasn't a big fan of the Ted's addiction to meth storyline. It made no sense. In season one he was deeply against Blake's addiction, so why would he do it? I knew he was down and out but it made no sense.Lastly, the length. The seasons are normally twenty shows long. Only fourteen? I feel cheated.Not a great season but I will definately be waiting out Season Four."
5,Great show,"Regardless of age, gender, or sexual orientation, compared to most of the bland drivel on television this is just a great show.As well as the gay issue, which is pretty much dealt with in all the other reviews, i think this show succeeds largely due to depthful characters, well written scripts, and artful shooting. A quality series."
4,Queer as Folk-Season Three,"This season was very entertaining because it involved a lot of great story lines. The drama causes you to just want to stay home and watch all 14 episodes. If you are a fan of the first 2 seasons, I think you should definitely buy Season 3."
1,subtitles,I'm very annoyed by the fact that there are no subtitles.Doesn't you have deaf-mute people in your country? I'm Italian and my sister is deaf-mute. We bought the first two seasons by amazon france (european editions with english subtitles). And now? How is she supposed to go on with the series??A lot of extras but no subtitles. This is discrimination!
4,Not as Good as Seasons one and two,"I agree with a few people on here. Season three has exciting moments, but i found myself staring at the ceiling half the time instead of watching the TV. The episodes i really liked were the ones were Ben was using steriods,and the last episodes when they were trying to stop stockwell from being mayor. Im not saying the third season is bad, just not as good as the first and second seasons."
4,Its well worth it!,"It seems that the series keeps getting better with each season, though I am abit dissapointed that they cut this season back to only 14 episodes. The special features on this dvd are geat and I highly recomend it!"
5,QAF keeps getting better... and Im hooked,"Season 3 of Queer As Folk continued the storyline of a group of gay and lesbian friends living in Pittsburgh. QAF is the most addicting show, even to a 25 yr old straight girl. The story lines, and the characters are beautiful and keep me turning the tv on every Sunday night, and looking for it again late Tuesday nights. I have Season 1 & 2 DVD's and love watching all of the extra footages that they have. I look forward to seeing what kinds of bloopers they will show us on Season 3."
4,smart choices...,"At first I was appalled that the season was only 14 episodes...However, that ebing said, i think it was incredible and agreat decision. It took away some of the fluff from season two... if they had tried for 20 episodes, there would have beena lot of filler, which is what happened to season two. It could have used a little more stuff in there true... some more of the stuff that season one made us expect - but this season i think was good. it had some of the best developed characters we have seen yet, and it didnt fill up hour long chunks of time killers so that the story lines would stretch over 8 more episodes. they probably could have had 2 more episodes and still dont a great job, and i am not 100% sure i like everything that happened in the season... i cant stand hunter at all, the actor OR the character... but thats OK.... overall I think the 3 season was testament that QAF is not a hit and run hit, and will be around for a little while longer, at the least..."
3,not so perfectly queer,In the third season the best show begins to show its age. It starts with Justin leaving Brian. And Ted and Emmitt trying to have a relationship. Are we to believe Brian is broken hearted over Justin? Is Ethan the perfect match for Justin?What started out as a great study of life for young gays in smalltown America has fizzled to a soap opera for its straight female fans. The two scenes hit bottom for me are Lindsay and Melanie asking Brian to be the father of their second child. Why would any man agree after the hell they put Brian through with Gus? And even more unbelievable is the reunion of Brian and Justin. How many times must we endure the breakup and reunion of Brian and Justin? I'm sure the straight female fans gushing over the nudity are thrilled. But for the rest of us it is very old news. The show works better when it strays from the soap opera like watching Brian taking down Stockwell. For me those are the best moments of the series. Just skip over the soap opera.
4,queer as folks,excellent programing. i never watched this when it was on showtime a fried lent me the first season and it got me hooked. wish more of this type of programing was on tv.
3,Okay but not as good as earlier seasons,"I thought the first season of Queer as Folk was just fantastic, so I purchased the next two seasons. Each successive season has gotten weaker and weaker. The story lines are ever more sensational, bordering on ridiculous, and often times the most difficult tensions in the plot are not resolved by the characters, but they simply disappear from the plot. For example, Michael and David are in a great crisis, the suspense in high as you can't imagine how they will get out of it... cut to Justin and Bryan, then back to Michael and David and the crisis is solved. How? No idea, and apparently the writers didn't have any idea, either. This said, the third season is mildly entertaining, but I have no intention to go on to the fourth or fifth. I understand the downward trend just continues."
4,Good overview and Presentation,"This book is easy to read and presented in a fashion that does not bore you nor speak above the average person. It is a good book for beginners to intermediate photographers. Great photos that depict what the author is talking about. This is a quality book that should help the novice photographer take much better pictures, it will even remind the forgetful on some of the basics and advanced thinking and practises of taking a great photo.Thanks!"
5,Great reading and reviewing material.,"If you are like me you can't absorb everything you read, but enjoy a book that gives more info each time you read it. This book is great for the beginner and novice in photography, especiall digital photography. Repetitive but after a while I get it!"
3,what i learned,this book taught me a few things but most of the thing i already knew from just playing with my camera.it hit me as more of a book for someone who has just gotten their first digital camera and hasn't had much experience with photography.it did help me with my macro photo's which is the reason i bought the book and the information on how to filter effects by blocking light helped me as well but thats about it.i may go ahead and purchase a complete book on just macro photography since this didn't have nearly enough desired info.
5,How to do everything with digital photography,"Provides an in depth knowledge of digital photography, with easy instructions and good illustrations."
1,Not a great purchase,"I purchased this book in anticipation that I was going to get good sensible information regarding using my Digital Camera, I was expecting to read how to use the various controls, I was very dissapointed and I would not recommend this book"
4,Wonderful first issue from Acoustic Alchemy,"I have been a fan of Acoustic Alchemy for years, but somehow never obtained this, their first offering until 2006. I was surprised to learn that Greg Carmichael was not on it. In fact they had not even met when this album was issued. The ""AA"" sound however, is very evident through Nick Webb's wonderful playing and writing, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this to any AA fan or fan of the acoustic jazz genre."
4,Top Quality,"Great pots and pans. No issues at all. Very even heating bottoms. Exact quality you can expect from All-clad. Cleaning is easy, but no dishwasher. Stains come out with a little bar keeper's friend."
3,Not for the Amatuer,"This product has a lot of very good features on it, but its geared to people who know what they're doing. If you haven't used editing software before you might be lost on this. Even the directions aren't quite detailed enough. Start out with Windows Movie Maker or Nero.This product is good if you have experience with editing videos before."
3,crappy design,I bought one of these to replace an identical one that had a defective brass washer seat that eroded over time. Really aggravating that I had to replace the entire unit because the water fitting is molded in with no reasonable way to replace it. They obviously saved a few cents molding it in by creating an un-reparable product. On the plus side it was the right product and shipped promptly.
4,water hatch,"Prompt delivery, reasonably priced and fits exactly like the unit from the factory. Be sure you have some of the putty tape for the installation to seal out water around the hatch."
3,This is a bootleg: dont buy it.,"First off, this is a bootleg of the original LP issued by Francisco Lupica in 1976. Mr. Lupica makes NO money from this. Secondly, according to Lupica, it is also broken up and tracked wrong. He is working on reissuing this music himself (along with others).I gave it three stars (it deserves 5) because the music is astounding, but cut it to three because it is a bootleg botching the original release."
2,"Maybe for doctors, but not for full-time medical writers","Although physicians, researchers, nurses, and other health professionals do write, a great deal of what is considered ""medical writing"" is done by people who work in contract research organizations, communications companies, continuing medical education groups and advertising agencies. This book is probably not suited to the needs of full-time medical writers. Any A-Z book claiming to be useful for these writers must include the letter combinations ""FDA"", ""ACCME"" and PhARMa""."
1,"Too, Too small!","This product, and it's size, fooled me, too! Have to be more carful, when shopping(sizes)!I can only fit a spoon, in this rest!"
1,"Excelente trabajo de arte, muy mal envio","Usualmente nunca escribo en estos reviews pero tengo que aceptar que la opinion de otros me ha influenciado cuando quiero comprar un producto el cual no tengo mucha informacion. Por esta misma razon senti la necesidad de decir algo acerca este envio en especial.El trabajo de fotografias que nos muestra Man Ray en esta recopilacion de la edicion original de 1934 es algo exquisito para el ojo de conocedores de su arte, por eso reafirmo que la calificacion que estoy dando es por la calidad de envio, no por el trabajo del artista que merece 5 estrellas sin ninguna duda.Amazon de verdad que desepciono esta vez al enviarme un libro algo maltratado y doblado en algunas paginas, a pesar de que supuestamente es nuevo, no lo parece por el mal manejo que se le ha dado."
4,"Cute, but...","I love this accessory for my doggie, but one stone has already fallen out. My dog is small and does not tug at it. A little disappointed. But it is very cute."
1,not happy,"I wasn't all that impressed with this collar for the money. In fact I feel a bit cheated that I speant $10 on this collar when it's so very obviously not worth more then $5. The clasp doesn't work unless you pry it open and then push it back closed - it's constantly falling off my dog's neck and some of the stones in the bone charm are already missing. Needless to say I won't be buying anything more from the ""Paris Hilton"" line in the future."
2,I was actually a bit disappointed in this collar,"I don't think it's nearly as cute in hand as it appears online. Also, the clasp seems quite a bit off center, making it hard to adjust for my small Yorkie.She has a lovely pink suede collar with a rhinestone heart. I guess she will just continue to wear that."
3,a mid range review,"I noticed that most reviews were one star against or 5 star for which I thought was interesting. It seems the pendulum swings from those in the movement to those who hate it.As an ex Wof'er I agree with Hanks's book in that it is a false message being propogated. It is important to speak the truth in love though so I take off two stars. For those still in the movement I encourage you to study the Scriputures yourself and not be easily led by preachers. To those outside I encourage you to study the Scriptures yourself and not to be easily led by preachers!!!It's very easy to jump on a bandwagon after reading a book like this and become a heresy hunter, much better to love Jesus and His people and to seek to gently lead other's into truth, and this comes from an ex Wof'er and ex Calvinist!!!"
4,Hank Hanegraaff tells it how it is,"According to Walter Martin ' Controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command.'Hank Hanegraaff doesn't shy away from such a challenge in His bestselling book 'Christianity in Crisis.' Througout this well reserached piece,Hanegraaff explores his concerns surrounding the so called faith movement. Throughout, the pages he clearly presents us with evidnece relating to financial mismanagement and bizarre biblically challenged theology.Those struggling with faith issues, will be glad to know that being poor or sick isn't a sin. Neither, will they have to feel intimidated by people whom claim to be spiritually superior. Such books are a refreshingly welcome alternative and enpower readers to increase discernment in their own lives.The Bible tells it's followers to watch out for wolves in sheep's clothing.Hank Hanegraaff helps us to do just that !"
5,Christianity in Crisis,"A real eye opener for the Church of Christ. Very informative in how the ""great"" TV evangelists are adulterating the Word ofGod."
4,A Charismatics opionion,"I must say that Hank exposes these false teachers that claim to be charismtics. Frist of all, to all the Charismtics out there this book doesn't bring down the Charismtics movement at all, in fact it is a valuable tool in exposing the frauds out there that give Charismtics Chiristians a bad name. Word of Faith movement=Trinity Broadcasting Teachers..."
1,"Mis-statements, partial truths and outright lies.","This book, authored by the self-proclaimed 'Bible Answerman'. Hank Hannegraff, is the largest collection of mis-statements, partial truths and outright lies I have ever seen. According to Hannegraff, the Faith movement, as exemplified by such men of God as Kenneth Copeland, Kenneth Hagin and others, is heretical and cultic. Hannegraff proceeds to prove this 'point' with a large collection of straw man arguements, false dichotomies, and several statements that border on slander , one case in particular being an internationally known minister of the Gospel is actually referred to as ""...an expert at relieving poor people of their money."" Another example is a particular well-known study Bible is referred to as ""... the worst study Bible ever written."" Anyone interested in the Faith Movement would be best advised to study God's Word for themselves, and leave so called 'answer men' be. I am being generous with the one star."
1,"Hank must have slept through ""Accurate Research 101""","The book is a compliation of mis-quotes and quotes taken out of context. He obviously was not at all scholarly in the research of this book. He went in with a pre-supposed ax to grind. The so-called ""Word of Faith"" movement certainly has had its excesses along with other good movements like pro-life. Most people I know that believe along these lines have great Christian familes and share Jesus well with others. People like Hank that go on these crusades unfortunately, in the words of Jesus, ""don't know what spirt they are of."""
2,Totally Obscene to the 'Full Gospel' Christians',"This book is totally obscene to the 'Churches' admonishing the Christian Gospel of Jesus Christ. Crisis is an obscene word to the 'Full Gospel Christians' in general. This book is full of mockery and full of 'intentional' criticism to the Christian churches who are not perpetrating the 'Word of GOd'..The 'Full Gospel Churches' are not in 'Crisis.' (THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES) that is, other churches that are not publisizing the word of God in full potentiality are in 'Crisis.'This book should be read by the 'Christians' in general not by the 'Secular' world of 'skeptisim and 'avolitionists.End**"
1,Histrionic,"The book is well researched and contains a plethora of good information about the helth & wealth movement. Unfortunately, I would never consider giving the book to my friends and relatives in the movement because, as other reviewers have noted, the book is a personal attack, rather than a loving apologetic. Hanegraaff paints himself as a martyr, ill-treated by those awful people in the movement, and then proceeds to rub their face in the dirt in the most mean spirited way. It is sad that such a well-researched book couldn't have been more well written. It could have been such a wonderful tool for reaching out to those in the health & wealth movement."
3,Different than they used to be,"These were one of our go-to treats for the pup. The recent bag I received has a different look, both the package and the product. The ingredients list has changed and the treats are now a crumbly moist texture. Not thrilled. Was Zukes sold to one of the big treat manufacturers?"
5,Awesome!!,"These are great! My pup looooves them. Usually I give to her after exercising. It's her power bar!! Great quality, NOT from China, which I really appreciate. They are a perfect size (bite size), but sometimes I brake them in 2 pieces for training. I recommend for dog owners that like quality over quantity."
5,Looking to super charge your dog,"My Westie, Oliver loves these treats and he really enjoys running agility courses. These treats are a real motivator for him.Check out our blog at [...]"
3,Zuke's Power Bones Chicken,"My dog loved these, but I thought it was a bit pricey for 6 oz...also these are soft chews and not 'bones', I thought they were like Milkbones. Nothing wrong with the product, maybe I should have paid more attention to the description."
4,Dog goes crazy for Zuke's,"We have been using the Zuke's mini treat's as a training treat for our puppy. She loves the mini treats, so we decided to try out the power bones in the Peanut Butter variety. The pup goes absolutely crazy for them. We use them as a high reward treat for her after behaving on a long walk. Its a great treat made with great natural ingredients in the USA. What's not to like about them."
4,Dog Treats Needed,"Dog treats for my pup that are made in usa and natural are what I look for, this product and Zuke's rocks."
5,Good Treat,My mini schnauzer loves these. They are a great training aid and the dog seems to really enjoy them. Thesetreats are healthy and somewhat higher in price than some other brands but I was well pleased as was my pup.
2,"Reprinted maps are dark, and hard to read.","This reprint of ""The 1930 Olmsted-Bartholemew Plan for the Los Angeles Region"" is more exactly a low-quality copy. The maps are so dark they are very difficult to read, and the way they are bound into the book, much of the details are lost into the seams. The original maps were color, so any references to colors in the legends are lost, and the gray scales blended together make the maps even less articulate. It's important that a document such as this is reprinted for all to see, but it seems as if this volume has missed an opportunity of becoming a library keepsake."
5,LOVE it!,"This is one of the best things I've bought for my baby!! We have two other slings (the adjustable kind with rings) and a baby bjorn-- none of them hold a candle to the peanut shell. It is the easiest to put on and the most comfortable to wear-- not to mention more fashionable. If my baby is tired and fussy, I pop him in the shell and he goes right to sleep. He also really likes trips to the supermarket because he gets to look at all the goodies at shelf level-- not like being trapped in a car carrier. FYI- because it doesn't adjust one size does not fit all-- my husband's shoulders are too big to wear my peanut shell, so he uses the bjorn."
1,Peanut Shell Sling - Son didn't like it,"My son was so squished in there...never liked it one bit, kept screaming to get out. So for me it didn't work but I gave it to a friend and she said that her baby really liked it so go figure... It all depends on your baby!"
4,Great Baby Carrier,"I enjoy using this product for working around the house or taking a walk around the block with my baby. The product does take getting used when it comes to positioning the baby inside, but doesn't all baby carriers?! I can't wait to try the other carrying positions when he gets older. The company also has good customer service and was able to resolve an issue I had in the order."
1,Unreadable,"I needed a crash course into LDAP, and that book was the only one available - and for a good reason! The author, while probably a competent engineer, is a complete failure as an author / teacher. He cannot express even simple concepts. After spending a few frsutrating days with this book, I turned to other texts. Now, already understanding LDAP, I still find most of this book misleading at best. Of course, lack of editorial review did not help this book either; many places in the book don't make sense not just from technical, but also from grammatical standpoint.Don't waste your time on this one - read ""Ldap: Programming Directory-Enabled Applications With Lightweight Directory Access Protocol"".Or even better, simply install iPlanet LDAP server and read the documentation."
1,"'Tis poorly written, 'tis true","If in every section 10% of the paragraphs would have been cut, if Wrox press would have used a spell checker, and if an editor would have been allowed in the building, it's possible that I would have been able to focus on the content. My head is still dizzy from shaking it back and forth while reading this book.The author does seem like a nice guy. Better luck next time, Mark."
3,This book is a bit disorganised,"There is little depth to this book and the reader needs to do a lot of sifting to extract valuable information. Even after doing that, the information obtained is still fuzzy. Beginners may get confused whilst non-beginners may find the book frustrating for lack of substance. I'd try a different book."
4,Great book - good LDAP introduction,"This book is an excellent introduction to LDAP. It assumes that you have some knowledge of Directory Services already. I recomended this book to anyone wanting to create an LDAP service.The editor missed some signifigant typos (When you're messing with d: uid=scarter, ou=People, o=foo.com, a typo can really matter)."
2,"Repetitive, poorly edited.","Reading this book was my introduction to LDAP. It stressed first concepts well but then began to repeat them over and over, meanwhile glossing over more advanced issues.Some of the grammatical constructs in the book were difficult to manage at best and should have been caught by an editor.Overall it was somewhat useful, but a much better book is ""Understanding and Deploying LDAP Directory Services"" (Howes, Smith and Good). I recommend it to anyone who has been tasked with implementing an LDAP project."
1,Too simple. Too much on NSDS 3/4. The worst book on LDAP.,"Only the simple Java/C code. Nothing on extensible object (schema checking) and other V3 features. Objectclass definition is different amount different LDAP vendors. The LDAP server description on NDS, Active Directory and OpenLDAP is not enough and lack of in-depth analysis. No memtion on Microsoft Site Server 3.0. Nothing on the usage of ""uid"" and ""cn"". (Different LDAP vendors has different ways to identify entries, although LDAP standard says ""uid"" is the one)Nothing on LDAP_ERROR codes.This is the worst book on LDAP and a failure for Wrox."
2,Worthless!,"Never seen so many pages of poorly written text. What is the point of covering everything from LDAP, to JNDI and all the commercial directory server product variations if none of them can be covered sufficiently? Very, very poorly written."
5,Useful and varied example-driven book,"This book is squarely aimed at the practising developer/administrator, with tons of useful examples in C, Java and Perl. The examples apply equally as well to UNIX and NT, and the problems tackled are rooted in real-world experience. Mark's experience in implementing LDAP for a large user base shows through clearly. Also, there is an honest appraisal of open-source platforms, which is refreshing in a book aimed at pactising pros. Recommended."
4,A great introduction - multiple languages too,"I like this book better than the other books I have seen on the subject. I liked that he uses multiple languages and gives several good implementation projects in the back. The only thing I would have liked is more alternative uses for LDAP besides the ubiqitous address book. I would like to hear of some really creative uses for this technology. Kind of like the SQL storage example, but more of these. I guess we'll have to invent some, and then version 2 of the book will be able to list more. :)"
4,Sorme Mineral Secret Light Reflecting Mineral Loose Powder,"I love this stuff, Works great for a no makeup look.price was right. It arrived on time."
2,Misleading Title,"The title of Gazza Agonistes pretends to a pitch of literary ambition that the text itself does nothing at all to bring into fulfilment. There is nothing special about the writing here - not even judged as journalism, much less as what I hoped (especially from an established poet) might be an attempt at contemporary mythopoeia. Having said that, it is very readable. I just got the wrong idea about it from the title. I only read it because of the title. Not that I regret reading it, now that I have read it."
3,Nada de amor,"¿Cual es el verdadero rostro del amor? Es la pregunta que se encuentra en la contraportada de ""Travesuras de la niña mala"", desafortunadamente ésta no es contestada a lo largo de la lectura.La protagonista de esta novela es una mujer ambiciosa y manipuladora que se ampara en la pobreza sufrida para justificar sus actos egoístas. Una pobreza que el autor no describe, imposibilitando al lector a sentir simpatía por el personaje. Un personaje unidimensionalque perpetua el estereotipo de la mujer latina capaz de vender su cuerpo y más- su dignidad por unos trapos.El es un hombre aburrido consigo mismo, que se somete a un sin fin de humillaciones para salir de su tedio, en manos de esta mujer la cual el llama ""niña mala"", un mero eufemismo.El tiempo no sana a ninguno de los dos de su patología y el autor pretende vendernos la idea que una tortura tan larga, por ser larga debe ser amor.La verdad, ambos personajes pertenecen a la silla de un terapeuta."
2,"Por Dios, ¿qué le pasó?","Como aficionado acérrimo de MVLL desde la Ciudad y los Perros, encontré esta última novela bastante decepcionante. El personaje central se tilda a sí mismo de cacaseno, precisamente el vocablo que utilizaba MVLL contra los apristas en las elecciones del 90. Pero es más un aburrido total sin pizca de la picardía limeña. Cuando el personaje estaba a punto de tirarse al río en París, daba ganas de darle un buen empujón para ahorrarnos por lo menos cien páginas más de tortura. Y su contacto con las eventos sociales de las últimas décadas se asemeja a la de un Forrest Gump quien todo lo ve y nada lo capta. Pero quien diga que la vena de MVLL ya se acabó se equivoca: la reciente Fiesta del Chivo es fenomenal.Los hinchas del fútbol tenemos que clarificar una error en el libro: el compadre de Valeriano López en el Boys (y luego en el Alianza) en los años cincuenta fue don Willy Barbadillo, no Jerónimo Barbadillo quien militó en la selección del 82."
4,"Another ""feel good"" release...","The songs on this album definitely invokes positive images. ""Jennifer's Lullaby"" is a perfect tribute to Stan Getz, while ""Gliding"" gives you a feel for gliding in the air. This album shows signs of the bands maturity."
5,Starts great - Ends great,Weekend in Monaco is an outstanding effort by the Ripps. A great addition to any jazz lover's collection.
5,A classic,"This one is GREAT! It captures you, makes you listen, and uplifts you all throughout. This is one of my 3 all-time favourite jazz albums and the song ""Weekend in Monaco"" may be my favourite jazz song."
2,Only for recent college grads,I can see how this might help if you are still in your senior year of college but it wasn't in the least helpful for this career-changer.
2,"if you possess common sense, you don't need this book","While the book is certainly professionally composed and useful enough for someone who has never looked for a job, I don't really see one original or even uncommon idea in this book. I get the same ""Ah-Ha!"" factor out of a set of instructions on how to put together a new office chair."
2,DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP,"THIS BOOK WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH. FOR A ROMANCE NOVEL THE READER DID NOT GET TO GO ALONG THE JOURNEY OF THE ROMANCE. THE TRANSISTION WAS JUMPY. ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME IS USUALLY THE LEAD CHARACTERS GET TOGETHER, ITS THE JOURNEY WE AS READERS LIKE TO GO THROUGH. I THINK THE STORY ITSELF WAS ORIGINAL BUT IT DID NOT LEAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION AT ALL."
1,Hole in first one out of the box,Just got the gloves.... there was a hole in the first one out of the box! Good thing I'm not using them for medical purposes!
5,Heavy Duty Disposable Gloves!,"We have used these gloves for over two years now and there is no going back to the old disposable gloves. For a disposable glove these Microflex Safegrip gloves hold up extremely well to some tough conditions, some of guys wear the same gloves several times, because they are so tough. Our shop guys will not use other gloves now. You won't be sorry!"
2,the quality is less than before,"I'd been using this glove for more than 6 yrs. We're a mechanic and we all love this, the last carton that i bought, the material definitely thinner not as thick as before. I can tell by the weigh slightly lighter, paid good money for it and expect to be the same but not."
3,Glove review,"The product itself met my expectations, however the description of the product was inaccurate. The description talks about a box of 100 but I received boxes of 50 with my order."
4,Quigley the Intellectual,Okay I bought this cuz President Clinton was a protege of this American Philospher. Quigley makes you think and there are some great observations in this book. I didn't read it from cover to cover.
3,Alternative readings,"This work nowadays seems somehow dated. I'd rather read the following books (all of them interesting works dealing with CIVILIZATION and/or the STATE) instead of Quigley's: 1) ""War in Human Civilization"" by Azar Gat (war explained, not just narrated); 2) ""War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires"" by Peter Turchin [who has also written ""Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall"" but which is a work far more complex to read]; 3) ""Understanding Early Civilizations"" by Bruce Trigger (a great comparative review of early civilizations); 4) ""History of Government"" by S.E. Finer; and 5) Political Thought: 5.1. and 5.2: ""The West and Islam. Religion and Political Thought in World History"" plus ""A World History of Ancient Political Thought"" by Antony Black."
2,Tragedy and Hope,Read Quigleys Tragedy and Hope. Its a much more important book(especially the 2nd 600 pgs) and a better read too. After reading it you will feel as though you were just pulled out of the Matrix...
1,Quigley's Folly,"The author's inattention to details was truly unfortunate.I remember his taking great pride in his credentials as a person with scientific credentials and his saying ""The ocean floor is covered with the shells of marine animals whose shells are made of calcium carbide.(when he meant to say ""calcium carbonate"")Had his statement been true, vast amounts of acetylene gas would bubble up from the seas and a match would cause a conflagration of unmatched proportions.Had this been his only error he could have merited a mild rebuke, but his book--which was required reading for Foreign Service School students--had many such errors.De mortuis nil nisi...?"
1,Have any of you morons ever heard of Spengler?,"O.K., as far a birth/life/death cycle in history,there is some one named Vico,(which the illiterate might want to look into when making such fallacious statements like how this hack author was the first to offer such a theory)....This book is a cardboard knock-off of real historians and historical-philosophers.I advise you idiots to read beyond the celebrity-read-it sphere, more often you'll find that you know zelch when it comes to the foundations that this banal guy has stolen from."
4,Wanted more!,"I have suffered from eczema all my life. I have always felt like I was alone with my skin problems. I liked the parts where she described the pain she went through as I too have felt the very same way and it helped me feel like there was someone who understood. My only gripe is first it could have used some editing and second, I wish she had written a much longer book to tell more of her life with skin problems as I could relate. All in all it is a good little book."
2,Common sense but no cigar,"Good, quick little read with a common sense approach but no major ground breaking information that can't be found over the Internet."
4,helpful little book,"This book is useful to anyone looking for an alternative treatment to eczema. It is a good introduction, but if you are serious about using this to change your lifestyle expect to do a lot more research from other sources."
1,Lithium battery,This battery is NOT good. Have charged it over an over again but it wont power my phone. What do I do with it?
4,A great Jim Hall album,"I'm a jazz guitarist and Jim Hall nut. I bought this one on vinyl, years ago. This was one of my ""go to"" albums by Jim. One of my top ten, all-time favorite jazz guitar albums, too. It's perhaps one of the earliest realizations of Jim's modern voice, when he really carved a place for himself in the pantheon of great jazz guitarists. Everything as a player had come together for him by the time of this album. I love all the tracks, and the self-duets are a rare treat. If it weren't for the steep asking price, I might yell a little louder. When you consider that you could buy several of his other greats for this price, it's hard to yell too loudly."
1,Boring,"If you enjoy being lectured to by a lefty, elitist snob and if you believe that your 'heroine' can outrun bullets, then Ripley books are just the ones for you."
4,Stylish and Sophisticated,"Spyro Gyra is one taletned band and Dreams Beyond Control is no exception. Some people may criticize the vocal songs but they are not bad by any means. Its just the band broadening their horizons and Alex Ligertwood sings both with much emotion.Nonetheless, the instrumental prowess of this fine band stands tall on many cuts especially Waltz For Isabel and Kindred Spirit. The piano solos on the later just blow me away. The Marimba touches on South Beach and Bahla are also worth noting. After a while many of the songs become quite tuneful.It certainly soothes my needs so why not give it a try?"
1,Their weakest album that I've heard ....................,"I have nine Spyro Gyra albums and this is the only one I never play. That is because there is not a single tune I want to hear again. I like ""Patterns In The Rain"" but the Alex Ligertwood vocals completely destroy it. And I like ""South Beach"", but the poor arrangement just makes me wish someone would record it again.That is all I can tell you. I don't play it.Update : I played it to review it, and now I am playing it again, but just one track - ""South Beach"". I've discovered that if I play it through speakers instead of headphones, the things I don't like about the arrangement are outweighed by the quality of the tune and the parts of the arrangement I do like. You can also get ""South Beach"" on their ""Millennium Collection"" album if you are unsure about buying this."
2,lame,"I don't understand how anybody could compare this album to either ""Breakout"" or ""Stories Without Words"" and not conclude that this is a bore. (They're the other two SG CDs that I own). I like laid-back Jazz to the likes of Chick Corea, but this is at the level of the more insipid Benny Goodman stuff. Even for background music, it'd be very easy to find music of higher quality.I do agree with the other reviewers that the vocal songs are especially deplorable. It's sort of like Buddy Rich singing-- it's something they should obviously not do."
5,A great book for any believer to learn about living in grace,An excellent book in that it combines Biblical truth and practical living. An great tool for anyone coming from a legalistic background or new believers that are learning about the new life that they have in Christ. The study guide makes this book an excellent choice for Bible studies or Sunday school classes. One of the best books I have ever read on the subject of grace. I would recommend to it anyone.
2,Take with a dose of skepticism...,"All readers should keep in mind that, as another reviewer noted, Arno Karlen is not an epidemiologist, biologist, or medical doctor.In fact, for a PSYCHOTHERAPIST, his analysis of the social consequences of disease are unfortunately short and rather insensitive, smacking of moralist judgment in several instances. Many of the anthropological theories he rests arguments upon are self-serving and little attention is given to alternatives. And really, is it ever appropriate to reference Biblical text as a source in a 'scientific' work??Overall, the book reads like an unending list of particular epidemiological incidents over human history, with a sensationally alarmist tone. Yes, it is a decent intro to human (and animal) epidemic history, but for any serious student of human health it leaves a lot to be desired. Furthermore, it is now outdated, being published in 1995, so readers should follow-up this book with some up-to-date research."
2,Not worth it.,"The nicest picture is the one on the cover. I was looking for images of retro homes to model my rooms after, but didn't find what I was looking for in this book. I like books where items are named specifically so one can track them down. This book fell short."
2,"Nice picture book, but really lacks documentation","I purchased this book thinking I could use it as a reference book for my Master's thesis paper on Art Nouveau's influence on the De Stijl and Bauhaus movements. I was wrong. This book contains a lot of really nice photos, but there is very little description about the photos. It even lacks identification of many of the subjects in the photos. If you're looking for a ""pretty book"" this is it, if you want an informative book look for Stephen Escritt's ""Art Nouveau."""
4,Susanna Oroyan inspires possibility in artdoll crafting,"This book includes some amazing images. There are several artists in this book besides Susanna Oroyan, but it is definitely her work and the details she brought to her pieces that make one want to begin the process of doll crafting. The book's doll images seem a bit dated now as many of them were created to reflect pop culture images from specific time periods. This is a good companion piece to have along with S.O.'s other doll crafting books. It provides excellent instructions on creating the doll's basic form and then ideas on how to proceed once the ""skeleton"" framework or wire armature is done. Susanna Oroyan was a treasure. Her generosity in sharing her knowledge and skills is sorely missed.Sincerely, rainadelmagick"
5,Eye Candy,"Again she has done a wonderful job. Great pictures,ideas inspiring.Would recommend to doll artist."
1,I need a colorful book.,"I think the content of this book is OK!But I do't content myself for received a black/white copied book.Though, I was objected to the Amazon,there are no any reply.Therefor I'll suggest who intent to buy this book,the book has no any color, in fact, it's a rudey copied item."
4,Just what I was looking for,This book is full of excellent information for anyone either considering starting an intentional community or living in one. It refers to experiences from all over the world ... what was helpful and where organizers got off track. Highly recommend!
4,My dog loves it!,Fast shipper...and product just as described. My dog absolutley devours these and it is good for him. Try it.
3,My dog's favorite treat...but price not competitive,I've usually found items listed by Amazon to be most competitive but was disappointed to see the price listed here. There are other on line vendors with better pricing.
5,Great Live CD,This is a great example of what a Live instrumental CD should sound! The songs are close to the original versions but played with more passion!!!
5,Not Your Typical Live CD,"As a rule I avoided live CDs, as they tend to be too ""showey"". However, this is one of the best CDs I've ever heard. My family constantly begs me to take it out of the player. I listen to it hours on end...definitely my favorite Ripps CD."
5,One of their Best,"With the exception of Black Diamond, I own every Rippingtons album they have released. If you only buy one Rippingtons CD, definitely get this one!! Tons of energy, great guitar and sax solos (and piano, too, thanks to David Benoit)...this is the Rippingtons album I most often grab when looking for something to take with me in the car, and has better versions of Weekend in Monaco and Curves Ahead than the original albums (which I like a lot, anyway). Get this one!"
2,Poor workmanship,"I used this purse twice, ranging from 4 to 2 hours each time. On the second use, the screw on the handle got loose and there is no way I can put it back since there is nothing to hold it on the metal bar of top. Emailed the customer service of the vendor, no response up until now. I was wondering if this is really kenneth cole product?"
3,"Heavy, hot, cumbersome, but safe","I have this carseat in Unity Blue, and my son bakes in it the fabric is so hot, and he hates it. It is really heavy even without my son in it, bulky, and hard to get in and out of the car. I have to put it in the middle seat in the back because it won't fit behind the passenger or driver's seats. It snaps nicely into the base, but I can't get the base secure with the seatbelts. It's hard to get my son in and out of the carseat - the restraining belts get hooked on his arms, the carry bar gets in the way, and if I put the carry bar back, the seat gets off balance and rolls backwards. Despite how safe I'm sure this seat is, I hate it and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I had the Graco SnugRide with my first son, and he hated that one but loved his Britax Roundabout, so I thought the Companion would be great for my second son. I was wrong. Don't waste your money on this seat."
2,not my favorite,"This car seat made my baby VERY HOT! especially his little head. He is 4 1/2 months old and already no longer fits in the seat. Its too heavy, the handle slices into your arm like a knife when you carry it . Most disturbingly it takes me two hands and all my strength to press the lever which releases the seat from the base (and Im quite fit). Removing the seat is such a nightmare.... I leave it in the car all the time and just carry my baby.Perhaps it is the safest... I don't know... safety always comes first.... if you do go with this one.. test out the release lever before you purchase and install that particular seat and most importantly be sure that the base does not jiggle out of the safety belt... belt must be locked to assure safety in impact!"
3,"Great for safety, but HEAVY!","We used this car seat for one month, and then had to buy a lighter weight one (Prima Viaggio). This was a very safe seat, and we loved that, but I simply could not lift it in and out of the car. It is also difficult to use in a car without the base, and perhaps should be used as such only in emergencies? Other than the weight, a great carseat, so if you are strong, this is the seat for you!"
4,We love this seat!,"We had the Graco Snugride car seat and our daughter HATED it. She is much more comfortable in this seat and sleeps in it better in the car. Her head NEVER falls from side to side and she seems to love the head rests. We have a couple little gripes- like the shade is kind of annoying, but that is so small and our daughter doesn't seem to mind, just us. It is no heavier than other car seats....and is much for comfortable for a baby. I'm glad we upgraded! I wish we'd had this from the day we brought our girl home!"
2,Evolve Kitten Formula,"My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat will not eat the Evolve Kitten Formula, so I cannot recommend it. I am forced to only award 2 stars. Even when I mix a small amount of Evolve in with other kibble that he eats, my cat is able to separate the Evolve from the other kibble and leave it in the bowl when most of the other cat food has been eaten. Evolve does come in a nice bag featuring a resealable strip, that many kibble cat food bags lack."
5,sangria pitcher,I would certainly recommend this company and this product. It was packed very well. All three arrived in perfect condition and my friends thought that the size was perfect. I will need to buy on for my self.
2,Picture doesn't match the product,"Description does indicate that this is a vial, not a mini... but where can I get the mini? Is the picture depicted on the purchase site a picture of a mini?"
2,Light blue sample,"Love the fragance, yet a little pricey for a sample. I will purchase the larger size from Amazon. Happy shopping!"
2,Mediocre at best,"With all the hoohaa about the duo, this CD came as somewhat of a dissappointment. The compositions were average and lacked imagination. Good for background music when you are not paying too much attention but nothing exciting hear."
4,Helpful product.,"The company handled our order efficiently. The cart is good, but a little hard to turn especially when loaded. It would be great if the front wheels turned."
2,falls short of expectation,"Pros: Light weightCons: When loaded with items even less than the max weight prescribed on this product, the push is very shaky as the entire arrangement might collapse and break apart. It could easily trip over the front wheel when trying to push through even an elevator gap where the wheel would get stuck in smallest gap and trip over."
3,Has horrible smell,"I gave it an average rating, since I haven't been able to assemble it yet. I have COPD and the chemical/paint smell is so strong that I had to remove to the porch to air out, but every time I bring it back in, the odor is back. I bought it to help me bring my groceries from the car to the house and am sure it would adequately serve its purpose. Hopefully I can find someone else to put it together."
5,Love it,I bought this for my granddaughter who is in collage. She lives 3 blocks from the laundromat and was having a hard time carrying everything. She loves this cart. The seller was very helpful and if I ever need to buy another I would definitely buy from them.
4,Wife loves it..,"Neighbors love it.they all wanted to know where I bought this cart from. So I gave them the info and they are buying one also. The reason I gave it only 4 stars, is because it came with no instructions and missing 2 washers. But I put it together and it works just great."
1,NOT WELL MADE,I BOUGHT IT BEFORE FROM SOMEONE ELSE AND IT BROKE WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF NORMAL USAGE . NOT WELL MADE
4,Good choice!,"I was pleased with this shopping cart. I really liked the liner that came with it. It will make my shopping days much easier, I won't have to take 2-3 days to get my groceries out of the car!!"
3,didn't quite meet my needs,This is a sturdy cart but weighs a ton and is difficult to move up stairs. Also the assembly directions are somewhat confusing.
1,Piece of crap!,"This cart is crap. Get a better one, one better built. The wheels kept falling off and it never really closed completely or easily."
1,Good customer service but stench still reeks!...,"Note: after 6 weeks on our deck the tires still smell too bad to bring into the house...boo ! makes the Good customer service pointless - (When the shipper lost my order she rushed another one immediately and checked to make sure it arrived on time. It did.) But when we opened the box we were knocked over by the stench. It has been airing on my deck in all of its pieces for several days and still we do not want to bring it inside - nasty, acrid, strong stench. The seller suggested Febreeze - it didn't even begin to help...Hopefully it won't take too many more days in the sun and fresh air, and then I will finally be able to test drive it!. Why do some things from China reek?"
1,Broke after 3 trips to Sam's Club,"Had one very similar for about 3 years, but it felt unstable for the last year, so bought this one. It didn't feel sturdy, not at all and it broke after 3 trips to Sam's club. Unfortunately already trashed my previous cart, so now without any cart, and not going to buy this one again."
1,Grocery Cart,"I was so disappointed in this product. I really wanted this for my mother. She lives alone and has a little way to walk to get to her apartment and she doesn't get around very well. This would have been great for her few groceries that she gets. When we recieved this package, it was so bent up and ruined that even if it was tried to be fixed it would probably just break right into. I called to report it and was told that I would be recieving another one, but never got it..."
1,"Came broken, cheap quality","I bought this cart and the metal wiring came snapped and broken in places which is understandable considering how cheap the quality of the cart is. Also the grip is thin plastic that cracked when I simply gripped it. I don't know how other's are giving this cart such a high rating because in my mind, on quality and durability alone, it is a POS."
3,Mirro 2 quart food mill,"I like that this food mill is stainless steel, but it is not as heavy duty as the old chrome one I had, and it does not work as well."
1,Nowhere near original Foleys products,"This food mill is a waste of money, the food mill cannot be adjusted to mill or even closely do what the original foley's Mill could do.It is cheaply made and the quality of the product says it all when you are using it. Requires three times the amount of time and effort to mill what the original comparable Foleys mill could do."
1,Didn't like.,I have a small potato mill that has to be squeezed. I felt like I couldn't get many pots in and its become harder to squeeze. Saw that Ina Gardner uses a food mill so I bought this one from recommendations. It doesn't push potatoes thru and leaves more potatoes in the input section. Don't like.
2,"clumsy, hard to use",right now its sitting in the garage. the handle is very hard to turn and its so small. probably will toss it. a masher is easier to use
3,foley food mill,"I was delighted to find this product because I have had one for 50 years and I wanted to give one to my grand daughter who recently went apple picking. I wanted to show her how to make old fashioned applesauce. I took the product up to Massachusetts and we made the applesauce. Unfortunately the little black knob that is used to turn the blade was poorly constructed and wobbled, making turning difficult. We debated whether we should send it back, but my husband fixed it with tools he had. I hope it doesn't wobble again and I regret not sending the whole thing back for a new foley food mill."
5,Works well!,This item does exactly what it is supposed to do. Another good purchasing experience thanks to the people at Amazon.
3,Nice product...a lot of work!,"I was really excited to try out my food mill to make mashed potato. It honestly does as you would expect and makes a great mashed potato without breaking too many starch cells, but wow was it a lot of work! Just know that going in..."
4,Food Mill,"I love this item, only thing they could do to improve it is to make the hooks longer that are on the sides it wants to slip off the pan have to always hold on to it"
4,Food Mill,"Every kitchen needs this -- great for making pureed applesauce, soups, smooth mashed potatoes. It is easy to use, and will last through generations! [[ASIN:B000LNUM8Q Mirro Foley 2-Quart Stainless Steel Food Mill]"
5,food mill,"Great for making jams. Old fashioned way of food processinng, but still very effective. Some things never grow old. Amazon doesn't disappoint."
3,Okay,Had problems with the nut coming off during use. Borrowed a friend old Foley Food mill with wooden knob and it worked perfectly
5,Foley Food Mill,The Foley Food Mill is a great new addition to my kitchen. \\It came in perfect condition and sooner than expected.
4,Tomato Juice,I love this food mill. You have to stop often and clean out the peelings and seeds from the tomatoes but it is still okay. It beats the old time way of pare boiling the tomatoes first and then whatever else was used. Worth the money. This is my 2nd one. My first one lasted for 30 years.
1,Thought it would be so much better...,I bought this as a replacement for the Foley food mill I had as I had lost the sweeping arm (screwed attachment at the bottom) on my old one. Made applesauce and went to use the new one and it took forever for the the applesauce to be pushed through the holes. Despite tightening it as much as possible - it doesn't seem to have enough pressure on the inside sweeping blade to push the food through. I finally gave up and went back to my old one which worked better even without the screwed sweeping arm attachment. I was so disappointed. I wish the small screw attachment would fit on my old one but it doesn't. I've just put the new one in the back of the cupboard...and will probably never use it again.
2,Too Much Waste,"I am using this mainly for mash potatoes. It does work, but leave almost half of the potatoes in the food mill. A ricer works much quicker with less waste. I ended up returning this item."
5,Quit happy with product,"I have a food processor but it is kept in the basement and for small jobs, (chopping tuna for tuna salad or chopping eggs for egg salad) I wanted something I could keep in a kitchen cabinet. This fit the bill. I fact my wife has started using it and she likes it also. It is also easy to clean, when you are done chopping. I am happy with this product"
1,Sent it back,"I thought that Foley would be the best. Not so. It has a fixed bottom with only one size of holes. They were too small for riceing potatoes, too big for seeding bIackberries and made applesauce like mush. I returned it and bought one that has three changeable disks with different size holes for different jobs. Has the versatility I need. The Foley also sits low in the bowl it is put over so you can't get much in your bowl. The one I got sits high on top of the bowl. Very important! Foley needs a redesign!"
3,Mirro Food Mill,"best that I found so far in the US, but not as good as comparable products in Europe. works ok, for tomato sauce, but not great, it takes longer than it should to process the food with this mill.Cleaning is fine, but watch out that you don't loose the little parts."
5,From a long time Bach Fan.,"I love Bach Cantatas and listen to them about 5-6 hours per day and have done so for the last 30 plus years.While on a recent flight on Etihad Airlines (the airlines of the United Arab Emirates- which by the way is AN OUTSTANDING airlines- for example they have very good pricing, great food, and over 60 movies to choose from-- also they have camera views so you can see exactly what the pilot is seeing, and another camera view so you can see straight down)- I started listening to this Bach recording.I was VERY VERY impressed with it. Everything seems to work well in this recording. I bought a copy for myself and plan to buy another for a concert pianist friend of mine. Please listen to the samples that Amazon provides. I think you will like it."
3,too routine for me,"Angela Hewitt's two disc traversal of Bach keyboard concertos has received all kinds of critical acclaim, but to my ears this volume does not live up to its high reputation. Angela Hewitt has moved to the front of the pack of Bach players on modern keyboard - she plays very fluidly, and very respectfully. But her gentle, middle of the road approach, while pleasing, seems to lack genuine excitement. I won't say that her playing is bland, but it is certainly predictable. I have Hewitt's set of English Suites, which is more satisfying than the concertos; so I am not completely unsympathetic to her approach to Bach. Perhaps part of the fault here lies with the Australian Chamber Orchestra which sounds thin and uninspired? In any event, I bought the first volume of this set and returned it unopened after listening to the second volume.How I wish Klara Wurtz would tackle this repertory...."
2,Read the damned description,"So here I am thinking 'cool, I'll get these gravestones to add to my lawn collection'....yeah no. These are for those tiny villages or railroad train sets or what not. Note to self: read the damned description.Otherwise they are great."
1,MINIATURE HALLOWEEN PIECES,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THESE AND I AM SURE IT IS MY FAUT, BUT I HAD NO IDEA THESE WERE LITTLE TINY TOMB STONES. I THOUGHT THEY WERE A NICE SIZE. I HAD PLANNED TO PUT THEM UP IN MY FRON YARD, SO IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY MONEY"
4,No harsh chemicals going to an area where you definitely don't want them!,"My salon tuned me into this product originally. They have it for about $22 there so I wanted to save some money. Originally had been using Tend Skin which had always made me nervous because of all the chemicals in it. Hovan's is definitely more holistic and still just as affective, if not more! Regular application is key, and I think exfoliation helps too to prevent in-growns."
5,Good thing worth buying,The book is as described. Fast shipment. Good thing to buy.I am using this book now. Helpful for my study.
2,Long Winded Explainations And Few Examples,"The text is very long winded and does a great deal of hand waving about fairly simple concepts. Examples tend to be extremely complicated and manage to not support the text. I've had much of this material in other classes, but people seeing it in this book for the first time are absolutely stumped.I have used Chopra and Meindl's ""Supply Chain Management,"" which is much better, but has some of the same flaws.The thing is, these guys are absolutely OBSESSIVE about playing ""hide the ball"" with their explanations, as if giving a clear example would somehow diminish the learning experience. Questions are garbled and vague with the absolute minimum amount of information. There are no solutions in the book, there is no study guide. The Cram101 Textbook Outline for this book is literally just an outline of the book, and completely worthless."
2,Dramatized Version,"The reading by Alexander Scourby is quite good -- worth five stars. But if you detest added music and sound effects (as I do), avoid this product. Nothing on this site or on the outer package warned me that it was dramatized. Only after I opened the package (rendering it unreturnable) did I find that it is filled with mushy, sentimentalized sound effects added by the editors."
4,Bring me back to eighth grade,"Had to get it in this packaging , due to the fact tis cover was only released like this on vinyl. It still a fun album to listen to."
3,A short story full of angst.,"""Guest"" was an interesting short story full of emotion and dilemma, but the ending is very unsatisfactory with loose ends. It'll keep you guessing and it's full of suspense, but the ending is a letdown. I ""sorta"" recommend."
3,Is really special paper?,"I honestly do not recommend this type of Resume Paper because it does not really stand out from regular paper, but it does have a different feel to it. When print something on to it, it makes the text look a lot clearer and sharper which is a HUGE plus for anyone is writing academic papers or cover letters. However, for Resume no because I notice that for Resume you will probably need a thicker Resume paper if you are planning to go to career fairs. I think the quality in a thickness feel would make a difference in getting notice. Only use this for cover letter or document typing. You can still use this for Resume purposes, but I prefer the same name brand under the Resume thicker quality, which happens to be linen."
1,Avoid,"It certainly is a good quality, but a huge watermark just completely ruins it. It takes a fourth of the page and pops out disgracefully regardless of the lighting and reading position.Don't waste your money."
2,So...So,"It looks good, but has some draw backs like1. Music is irritating2. Can not decrease volume below certain level.3. Screen (actual display)is too short.4. Display back ground should be with fluorescent color.5. It should be provided with AC adoptor"
2,"Cheap material, with small poor quality screen","Glad I didn't pay much for this laptop. It is poorly constructed. The buttons are super cheap and the lighting on the screen is poor. As others have noted, this is NOT age appropriate for a preschooler. My 7 year old does well with it. The options for changing games is geared more towards adults."
3,Too complicated for a preschooler,"My kid loved the laptop... but got frustrated in a few minutes, none of the games hold interest, too many buttons.The kid needs to be atleast 5yrs old before they can operate it by themselves."
2,for 4 and up? i dont think so!,"we recieved this yesterday as a gift for my 5 year olds birthday. i can't even figure out how to use it! there are too many buttons for a preschooler, too many words on the buttons, too many words on the screen, graphics suck, (i mean, its a kids toy, but you can't tell what things are supposed to be.) all in all, so far, i think this is geared toward kids way over the ages of 4, 5, 6, 7. maybe 8 and up. some of the games are simple enough, but if they can't read the buttons to get to the games, it means i have to watch over her shoulder and help her along thru the whole thing. like the other reviewer said, stick with leappad."
4,VTech Learning Laptop,"This was a gift for my niece who loves playing with it, and appears to be learning from it. It is durable and arrived promptly before Christmas."
2,Learning laptop,I thought the screen would be bigger than it is!! I also thought the screen would be in color as well. Bought this for my son for Xmas. His cousin has one except his screen is in color and now they fight over my nephews laptop. Gotta find one that has a color screen now
5,"Danny's life is frustrating, amazing and quite entertaining","I am too young to have ever watched the Partridge Family, but I was still completely entertained by Danny's book. Like him or not, this is a must read if for no other reason than to see what other lifestyles exist. Not to mention the inspiration of a life gone from one end of the scale to the other. Danny is witty, funny and terribly honest with the world not to mention about himself. Check this book out!"
4,What a GREAT Book!,"Danny, Danny, Danny,.....what an (...) you were in your younger days...That's what I kept saying as I read about all of his drug stories. I throughly loved this book. Not only was it highly entertaining, but made me reflect on my own childhood. Boy, did I realize I had it pretty easy. Danny had a difficult childhood, but am so glad to see he's straightened his (...) up! I highly suggest this for any of his radio fans, or fans in general! I cracked up all throughout the book. He is so honest and candid. It's awesome! Now, I'm an even bigger fan of his morning show here in Los Angeles!"
5,Excellent book I read in 2 days.,This book was incredible! Very candid and funny and hard to put down. I will be lending it to many others to enjoy!
3,Fun with photos,"I purchased Professor Franklin's Instant Photo T-Shirt software because I love to take pictures and alter them on the computer. This software allows me to be creative with the photos and print them on to special iron-on paper to be transferred on to t-shirts, mouse pads, apron, tote bags, etc. I tried the iron-on for the t-shirt and I have to say that I was not please with the results. I had a very hard time getting the photo to transfer. When I finally got it to work and gave it as a gift (with the washing instructions) the transfer came off. I spent a lot of time making the t-shirt to have it wash off. All in all, I enjoy using the software, but the paper is difficult to work with and is not as simple as it is made out to be."
3,Claudio Villa's early beginnings,"This CD is great if you prefer his early works. His voice is softer than his later works. The music is antique, not updated or modern."
5,A must,"What can i say, one of their best albums by far. Enigmatic, pagan, almost satanic. Buy it no second thoughts."
5,awesome shoes,my son loves his new shoes. he looks cool and bowls great with them. everyone on his team want a pair.
4,"Good Shoes, Goofy Shinny","The shoes are fine, but the red is a lot more brilliant in real life. It's almost like a shinny, red carbon fiber."
5,Secretariat - A Legend!,"I bought this tape shortly after Secretariat's death in the late 1980's. I wonder if people today know how much of a superhorse, a legend, this horse really was. How absolutely incredible he was. Today, because of the movie everything is Seabiscuit - Secretariat would have murdered that horse in a trot! I was privileged to watch the triple crown races in 1973 - after 25 years, this powerhouse came along and romped thru the three triple crown races - winning the Belmont by an amazing 31 lengths! His records still stand - he was a legend we may not see again in our lifetime! We can however, watch his genius on this tape. His triple crown races and the amazing Belmont victory are all there. You'll watch it more than once, I guarranty it."
2,Very hard to follow,"If you know nothing about Adobe Premiere then this is not the book for you. The lessons are hard to follow and sometimes very confusing if you are not already familiar with Premiere. It's practically impossible to go through the tutorial from start to finish without getting totally lost. The book does have some useful information regarding compression and embedding so I gave it 2 stars instead of none. I know a lot of people liked this book and that is why I bought it, but I just don't think it is for a beginner. I started out not knowing anything about Premiere and video editing and I still know nothing."
3,Tantalizing Appetizer-Where's the Main Course?,"Lynne Cheney's 15-page delivery is trenchant and engaging as expected from any presentation she gives. She zeroes in on the dangers of political correctness and engagingly sites a string of invidious examples currently raging at American universities.However, why this one speech was issued as a stand-alone work is curious. It is short enough to have been reprinted as a thought provoking magazine article or would have been a powerful chapter in a collection of similar orations published in book form.As an isolated speech it leaves the reader wanting much more. The wife of America's next vice-president has too much to say and has provided far too many brilliant speeches and essays for them to be offered on an individual basis like this."
3,cute bed poor customer support,"lacking quality... and poor customer service. we were waiting for 2 months to get the parts that were not included in the box... its cute, but the stickers peel off easily and the bars bend bad... but my daughter is still using it because despite all the flaws it is really cute"
3,Never had such issues before,This bed gave me more hassles then anything i ever put together. The bed stinks so bad like burnt plastic or cigarettes. It was not even the pretty pink color it makes it out to be. It has black coloring all through the pink so it looks like it is old or dirty. There were screws missing and wrong size screws in the package. The instructions were not really good instructions either. The only reason why i kept this item was because it was to much hassle to send back and my child really wanted this bed.
3,Nice little bed for grandma's house,"The bed is darling, but was rather difficult to put together. The screw holes int the metal frame were not cut through and was hard to line up the screws. Once together, the bed is well liked and serves it's purpose. Would not want this bed as my daughter's primary bed, though."
4,I love this bed!,"I love this bed, but it is somewhat hard to assemble. It took me like two hours to put it together( with my mom)because the screws were hard to get in. Its a cute bed though!"
4,"Makes Jackie Chan's old ""kung-fu comedies"" look high-brow!","...But wow, the fight choreography! The action is VERY good in this film, and I laughed at Casanova Wong's ""kung-fu master gone nuts"" character a few times in spite of myself. THE MASTER STRIKES is full of familiar faces: besides Wong, there's Yen Shi-kwan, the villain from FEARLESS HYENA; Meng Yuen-man from DAGGERS 8; and even Eddy Kao Hung(who popped up in numerous early-to-mid-seventies chop-socky flicks). It's also fun to count how many times the same extra plays a different character in this film ;)If you like kung-fu movies in the old style, you won't be disappointed in THE MASTER STRIKES."
3,is it worth the time or money...NO,"this movie has a couple of saving graces: the subtitles translations are quite ridiculious, and also the ""pole fighting"". i swear to god this has the best pole fighting action ive ever seen (and i have seen a lot). yet the characters are annoying and after a while one may become frustrated at watching them. (Action good =30 mins) rest of the movie is just pure filler. the movie as i remember it was long as hell so that 30 minutes may not even be worth the whole experience."
3,Some of the best fight choreography ever filmed!,"Cassanova Wong stars as a man who runs his own escort service and goes insane when he loses a valuable jade horse. Yen Shi-kwan hired him for the job, but then doublecrosses him. The story is bad with unbearable comedy at times, so there are only 3 things to talk about that are worth going over.#1- In the first major fight Cassanova Wong puts on a great kicking display in a restaurant.#2- Eddy Ko has a good fight with Yen Shi-kwan.#3- The finale is one of the best fight scenes in cinema history. So obviously it gets bonus points for that. Yen Shi-kwan is just on a totally different level. Only a few guys can match how deadly and fluent his movements are.3.5/5Crash Cinema DVD has good picture quality."
4,These Dreams,These Dreams by Barbara Chepaitis is a beautifully written novel. It makes you realize how much of a present life can be and how quickly it can be taken away. The main character is forced through a very though hardship. Death is one of the hardest things for someone to cope with. This novel takes you through the journey that Cricket is put through. The author portrays Cricket's struggle through this with such grace. This novel makes you think about how selfish some of us can be. How we take for granted what we have. I recommend that this novel be read by all.
5,UP UP AND AWAY!,"This is a really neat little book for the young adult reader... and, let's face it, for any reader. It is very well illustrated, and has dozens of illustrations of early photographs, sketches, and illustrations of flying machines, representing people's dreams, desires, and plans to fly. Some of these, in hindsight, are really really funny looking.This book includes most of the famous early flying machines -- everything from Leonardo daVinci's helicopter, to balloons, and the Wright Bros.The text is at a good young reader's level, but was an enjoyable afternoon's read for any adult.This is a great introduction to aviation for any young reader!"
2,Disappointing,"This book really just talks a bit about how to access data via ASP.Net, a bit about the ins and outs of the internals of asp.net and some talk about the middle tier.This book does not discuss anything about advanced application design. e.g. where should you store business logic? How do you design an asp.net application?There are no ""design"" questions answered. Its really just a discussion of some topics in asp.net. I read the book over 1 week and have taken nothing from it. I have 4 years experience in systems development with 2 years in .Net. A book titled ""Expert..Advanced Application Design"" should be just that.....an expert discussion of advanced application design!!!"
3,Not an application design book,"The main reason that I bought this book for, was what is on the book title: ""ASP.NET Advanced Application Design"". Unfortunately, this book merely scratches the surface of the application design. In fact a good title would be ""ASP.NET 2.0 Best practices"" or ""ASP.NET 2.0 New features"". Now, in case you are looking for such a book, this is a good book. It explains thoroughly every item and the examples are really good. So buy it if you need another opinion for specific ASP.NET topics but do not expect to see a detailed Application Design plan."
5,A must have for all ASP.NET architects!,"This is probably the best book on ASP.NET application design ever written. If you do any ASP.NET 2.0 development in your enterprise, then this book is your best friend. It's small, concise, and packed with to-the-point information.The book is split into three parts which map to the 3-tiers of 3-tier architecture: presentation, logic, and data. The presentation section covers the internals of ASP.NET 2.0, the logic section covers security, Web services, Enterprise Services, WCF and other topics, and the data section covers many data-related topics including the new .NET 2.0 provider models.This book is a must have for anyone who either wants to be a master or thinks they already are. For those in the latter group: prepare to be humbled."
2,does not work well,"I got this directly from hp when I bought my new laptop. I like the receiver storage on the bottom of the mouse. the convenient compact size and the included pouch made it easy to pack up for being on the go.thank god I didn't pay full price. it cuts out from time to time for a few seconds and won't work at all. like someone else wrote in their review, the receiver is kind of flimsy. I was afraid I might catch it on something and snap it off. sometimes it doesn't do anything when I click sometimes it double clicks when I only click once. it also crosses signals with my wife's logitech mouse and sends my cursor all over the place. just ordered a logitech myself and can't wait to throw this thing in the trash."
1,Poor Quality,"I would like to give this a higher rating simply for the relatively long lasting battery life. It is also easy to carry around, since it is so small. However, after having it for a few months the mouse has started to get skitso. The mouse will start bouncing around the screen when you try to move. You have to be very careful when using it for you might click somewhere you don't want to.To sum it up, I have to give this a 1/5 because I intend to buy a new mouse immediately. This was crap."
5,Italy: The Beautiful Cookbook,"Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditionas described, packaged well.Would use again."
2,"For lookin', not cookin'","Bleaah. Another of Lorenza de Medici's big, unwieldy books of gorgeous pictures of Italian scenery paired with mediocre recipes.The text, not written by de Medici, has several silly errors, saying that sugar cane came from the New World and pumpkins from the Old, which is backwards.The recipes are better than in some of her other cookbooks, where we were treated to a gorgeous picture of, for example, croque monsieur, which isn't Italian and isn't really a recipe.But not much better. Vegetarians might go for many of them, since they are supposed to be from the peasant kitchens, where meat was, until recently, seldom seen. Yet the recipes are dull enough. Steamed asparagus topped with butter and lemon is, indeed, a fine dish, but not really a recipe.The food illustrations are punk, well under the gorgeous picture of croque monsieur, for example.The full page pictures of Italy are superb, though, if you like that sort of thing."
1,Did not receive book,"I did not receive the book, Italy the Beautiful Cook Book. I received a totally different book that was meant for another person. I eventually got in touch with the seller and sent the book on to the rightful purchaser. However, ""Italy, The Beautiful Cook Book"" was not available . Amazon sent me notice of a credit made to my account. I would still like to find the book."
3,It's OK,"I bought this based on it's size and design. It was attractive, but not as practical as I was hoping. Many times when I cook something, it always request a 10 in. skillet, this skillet is too small for that request. I know that I am at fault for this one for not finding out ahead of time, but it does not wash well in the dishwasher, it works just fine, but the coloring is way off since it's only and final wash."
5,excellent product,"bought this product to go with my Smead Viewables tabs but it works great on any regular file folders as well as with the Viewables products. The protectors keep the file labels from being torn or worn off from frequent use. By the way, if you are not using Smead Viewables in your filing system, you need to be!!! Use this product along withSmead Viewables Labeling System Labels Refill - Labels - Letter A Size (8.5 in x 11 in) - 10 pcs.for your refills for the Viewables system."
3,"Cart Good, Wheels Bad","I like the cart, its sturdy and spacious, but my back wheel broke on the 2nd use. I bought some steel hubed wheels at the hardware store, and now its a good cart again. So, factor in the price of two good wheels (about $10 each) when considering this cart."
3,So far so good !,"It's too early to know if I'll keep this cart as long as the one I had before which just broke after 12 years of heavy use.This one was not too difficult to assemble but you need good eyes and some pliers or a strong hand at the end. I had to get some help from my son.Also it doesn't turn easily especially when very loaded. I live in a building and moving the cart through the doors and halls is not easy. The wheels on my old cart were easier to move and turn. Here you have to raise the cart and front heels by pushing hard on the back heels to make the right or left turn.Last thing : After 10 minutes in the apartment, the smell was horrible, like some sort of tar. I had to put the cart outside on the balcony for a couple of weeks."
4,Great cart,"I bought this cart for my mom as I wanted to be confidant it would not break down while she was out. Was originally sent the wrong cart, but they sent a new one right away."
3,Great Cart,"I purchased this cart for a trip to the shore. We were looking for something to lug all the beach stuff in everyday. I was a little leary because other reviewers wrote about the wheels falling off. I tried to replace the cotter pins before there was problem but I bought the wrong size. We never had a problem, but I will still replace the cotter pins. For the money and because it says it will hold 250 lbs it should come with thicker cotter pins."
4,A good cart,"Pleased with this cart. Sturdy. I use it for carrying groceries from garage to elevator to condo. It holds a lot of ""stuff."" The only drawback is the wheels. Made in China, so we don't know what they're made of. But they have an extremely strong chemical smell to them. In all candor, the smell is unhealthy and will seep throughout your apt/home.No way do you want to ""store"" it in a living space. I'd consider that dangerous to one's health. Plan on storing it in a garage or balcony. You will NOT wish to live with it. Other than that, it's a very solid investment."
1,BEWARE--MADE IN CHINA,"First let me say, I ordered the cart Tuesday morning and received it Thursday evening. UPS was great for once. The package was wrapped in tape to within an inch of its life, very secure. However, when I opened it up the next morning, I was disappointed to find a warped metal frame and cheap wheels. The frame may hold 250 lbs temporarily, but the wheels would fold. They looked to be made of a plastic foam, may not last a month. The handle of the cart was not foam or cushion but cheap plastic that seems like it will tear off if used for serious work. So not worth the $44 I paid. Maybe I'll try Walgreens, or rip off a kid's tricycle for it's wheels."
4,Great Value and Handy Tote,"The cart that I recently purchased was a great value and is invaluable for me since I am disabled. It was very easy to assemble. I use my cart to transport everything from groceries to potting soil, and sidewalk salt to flower and vegetable plants. It is extra sturdy for the jobs I do, too. I love it and it makes my life a whole lot easier. Well worth the price."
3,The wheels stink!,"This is a nice heavy-duty cart, but the wheels stink! They're outgassing some sort of volitle hydrocarbon. I have to store it outside. I can smell it for hours after bringing it inside."
3,Okay,Use only for light groceries. Not good for heavy loads.I placed several grocery bags and it was wobbly and not secure.
3,SO FAR SO GOOD,THE SHOPPING CAR I ORDERED IS WORKING AND CARRING THE WEIGHT SO FAR.I HAVE ONLY HAD IT 4 WEEKS.TIME WILL TELL THANKS
3,"BASTANTE AMPLIO, DEMACIADO ANCHO. OK.","COMPRE UNO HACE AÑO Y MEDIO. ESE ME DURO UN AÑO Y SE QUEBRO.COMPRE EL SEGUNDO EN EL MISMO LUGAR. EXACTAMENTE IGUAL. Y ESE DURO 15 DIAS.SOLO LO USE 2 VECES Y SE QUEBRO DEL TUBO DE LA PARTE DE LAS LLANTAS.ESTA MUY AMPLIO, PERO DEBERIAN DE MEJORAR LA CALIDAD DEL MATERIAL DE PRODUCCION.SERIA EL TAMAÑO PERFECTO.OJALA QUE LOS FABRICADORES INVIERTAN UN POCO MAS EN LA CALIDAD DEL PRODUCTO, AUNQUE LO VENDIERAN MAS CARO."
1,Beware !! this is not from Narita Trading,"Again, this seller is not Narita Trading !!This is knock off, don't fall for it!!"
2,Actual Magnesium dose,"The most disappointing thing is the failure to show the actual elemental magnesium in the pills. I think it is deceptive to put 500 mg Magnesium Gluconate up front on the label, make it difficult to see the ingredients list and then into the bargain leave the consumer to figure out that two tablets have ?64 mg elemental magnesium/14% daily value - 32 mg Magnesium Gluconate per tablet."
5,Amish Grace,"Great movie, if only we had forgiveness like they did, I learned a lot from this movie. Very inspirational, God moves in mysterious ways"
5,Amish Grace,The product itself was superb and new as promised but the service from Amazon and the company who sent it to me was excellent.Thanks
2,Not Amish,"After reading about the true story this film was based on I felt this film was fairly close. That was the only reason I rated this 2 stars. I didn't ""hate it"" but my family and I surely didn't like it.why?As said in another review, the ""Amish"" in this film are absolutely nothing like real Amish. We've known Amish families for many years and they are nothing like what this film represents.It is misleading at best.If you want to know what happened in Pennsylvania, I would recommend reading about it online"
5,Amazing Forgiveness,A movie that will touch you from every area. How faith in God leads an individual to forgive. How a child can touch the heart of an hurting & angry adult to the point of forgiveness.
5,An Amazing and Inspirational Movie,"This movie is amazing. Not only is it based upon a true story, but it deals very well with difficult issues. Get out the kleenex box.I recommend the movie to anyone who likes to see good win out. I also recommend the movie to anyone who struggles with forgiveness -- who thinks something was unforgivable. This movie is a great inspiration."
1,Pleasure Pal,"P.O.S Have it 3 yrs.Used it twice.Just doesn't do anything I enjoy.Don't bother with this.You'll fall asleep faster than you would with a boring,repulsive partner."
2,"Huge, and not discreet!","This product is not as slim as it appears to be in the photo, it is actually two times larger in width and length. Someone who is a beginner or likes it slim will not enjoy this Item. This is not a discreet ""little pal"" and cannot be discreetly stored in a little drawer. I did not even open up the package because I know I wont be using it, and now I need to find out how to dispose of it without the whole family knowing I bought myself a personal Item."
4,Pretty ring,"I like this ring. It is a nice shine and it is not a large flower which I was thinking when I ordered it. It is nice enough to be something that I can wear throughout the day and to the office and not have to take off when I am typing. It is a little larger in size, but I rather have my ring a little larger than smaller and having to put it away than showing it off. I like the way that this ring feels with the smooth band throughout the ring. Nice ring for a nice price."
5,Beautiful ring!,"When my ring did not arrive by the expected date, I contacted the vendor. Turns out the original package was sent back to them open and the ring missing! They promptly sent me a second ring free of charge. Wonderful customer service! The ring is very pretty. If you like the more antique look this ring is for you. I have larger fingers (size 9) and it is the perfect size. I was afraid the flower would be too small but it is very flattering on my finger."
2,Cheap looking and gift box was filthy,"I expected this ring to be a little more substantial in size. The band is also thin and cheap looking. This really looks like a little girl's ring. I am sending it back. Also, it came in a yellow satin gift box that was absolutely FILTHY! It looked lke it had either been handled by someone with disgustingly dirty hands or had fallen in the trash or something--just disgusting. I would not order from this company again."
5,beautiful ring,"just got this ring (fast service, and comes in a cute gift box). like other reviewers have said, it is not too big, and not too small. looks even nicer in person than in the photo. and, great price! highly recommend."
4,Nice ring,"This ring is a little bit smaller than I thought - I would like it is bigger, but is still nice. Delivery was quick and the ring has been received in a nice gift box. I would definitely order items from Gem Avenue again."
3,A little disappointing,"Although the ring is overall pretty and very unique, it had a chip in the silver plate. But no one notices it but me and I can kind of pretend that it's a smudge...lol. Overall it's a nice looking ring."
2,Nothing like to older ones!,The older one was better. I had it as a kid and want my kids to enjoy it. Nothing like what I had.
2,Overpriced and hard to use,"I love spirograph, and also know they can be tricky to use. I bought this hoping for a fun product for my young teens. It was just too hard to make even simple designs consistently."
3,rhymes don't capture my kids' attention,"my 15mo twin boys are not interested in this book at all. i rated it 3 stars hoping they WILL eventually like this book, but if they don't i'm going to try the dr. seuss one."
4,brilliant,The animals are visually engaging for children and funny for adults. The key to making a habit of reading with your children is finding books that they enjoy and you can tolerate. This is not only fun for kids but for their parents as well. Hurrah Sandra Boynton.
4,"Quick, short book","A very short alphabet book, with each letter illustrated by an adjective-noun pair. The animals get a little weird at the end of the book (xylo xylophoning? Uglybird being ugly?), but that's only to be expected."
