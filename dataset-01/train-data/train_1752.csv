1,Part breaks on 1st use!,Do not buy this part - it is absolute garbage.I bought two of these and the weld broke on both parts on first use. The weld is so weak that it almost breaks when turning with your fingers!I will go spend the $60 at Toyota to get their filter as it is worth the money and they don't break.
1,Wrench doesn't fit,I bought this wrench to remove a Toyota 65mm filter cartridge and it did not fit - advise going with another option.
1,Fails to Fit,"Waste of money. The dimension of the wrench is the same as the Toyota Venza housing to the thousands of an inch. Thats a press fit! Now, if you force it on, try to get it off! I ended using a sloppy fit oil filter wrench."
1,Terrible,Broke in on the first use! Very cheaply made product. I would not recommend this product to anyone to buy unless you want to waste money.
4,Very nice tool but picture & description is not totally accurate,This tool is zinc plated steel (not polished stainless as stated in product description). 1 inch Hex with 3/8 inch drive opening is spot welded on very solidly (not square as shown in picture) . Some sharp casting flash on inside of 3/8 opening was simple to file out. Tool worked perfectly on 2010 Toyota Corolla.Reccommend this tool and would have given 5 stars if pictures and description were completely accurate.
3,Not sturdy looking but fun,"The wheel squeaks and seems really cheap and it does seem a little on the small side. My son is 16 months and he likes it but since its so small, I dont see him playing with it very long. But its good for right now!"
2,Really small and cheap!,"I was not impressed with this wheelbarrow at all!! It was a gift for my nephew and was on his Amazon Wish List that my SIL created so I just bought it. My son however has a John Deere ""real"" one and it is a million times better than this really small cheap plastic one!"
4,Not the one pictured,"Wheelbarrow is cute. My son loves using it in the garden, but it is not the one pictures. Instead we received the green and tan one. My son was a little disappointed but still enjoys playing with the item."
1,NO FUN!,"Well I purchased it for my 18 month old son, and he doesnt really care about it as a toy.. he tried pushing it around but the thing wouldnt give him any fun. the front wheel is not even properly made.. it is cheap plastic and even bent, as it arrived. so the cart went zig zag and both of them kept falling.. he soon lost interest. I am now using it as a place to keep his books.. :PAnd yeah, we didnt get the red one which we ordered. We got this boring green."
2,I really didn't like the book,"The book is a collection of 13 retold fairy tales written by different authors. Some of the tales are modernized, and others are twisted. I liked ""The Months of Manhattan"" and ""Hansels Eyes"". The others were too strange, a better title would have been 'retold into fantasy tales'. I like the original fairy tales better. I think alot of fairy tales have an underlying meaning and these don't. If you like modern day fairy tales you would like the book, otherwise I don't recommend it."
3,Just OK,"I love the Snow White Blood Red series by the same editors, and was hoping for stories of the same quality from this anthology. Perhaps it was because the target age of the audience is so different, but I just did not find many of these stories interesting.There were a couple that I particularly liked (the retellings of Forty Thieves and then the dwarves PoV of the post-prince Snow White), but the rest of them were just....flat."
3,A Wolf at the Door: And Other Retold Fairy Tales,"I think this book was good. Although some parts were confusing, you would still enjoy it. I would reccomend this book to ages 9 and up. That's because there are a couple of curse words and a few hard words. Read this book, A Wolf at the Door: And Other Retold Fairy Tales, it's really good."
4,A Wolf at the door,"A Wolf at the Door has stories like Cinderelephant, Swans, The Twelve Dancing Princesses and more. I liked all of them. If you like stories that are a little gross and funny, than I think you would like this book. In Swans, Emma's mother dies and her stepmother can not stand noise, so when Emma's brothers get turned into swans because of their noise, it is up to Emma to save her brothers. Also in the Twelve Dancing Princesses, twelve princesses, all named after flowers, secretly sneek out every night and dance with dead princes who they will soon marry. The king, the princesses father, is asking men all over town to tell the king what is happenning to his daughers at night. Will a man be brave enough to go to the under world to find out? Read A Wolf at the Door to find out."
1,"The Wolf Must Have Blown Away the Quality, One Word Boring!","Retelling fairy tales we all grew up with is a sensational idea which has been done extremely well. Just not here! In other books yes, but here unfortunately no. The stories in this book do have one thing in common with the original motive of fairy tales. They will put you to sleep. These are some of the most boring low quality stories ever written. Also avoid the books Snow White Blood Red also edited by Ellen Datlow and Fractured Fairy tales by A.J. Jacobs as they are no better than this.If you do want really good retelling of classic tales rewritten in sensational format buy Once Upon A Crime or Politically Correct Fairy Tales. You will find what you're after in those books. The fairy tale is over success was not achieved here."
1,Ripped off!!,I really cant believe I got ripped off on this purchase!! Nowhere in the fine print did it say that I was ordering a cassette instead of a CD.Heck...I dont even have a cassette player in my house or my car.Bum deal by a bum person.
4,Rollator,"Bought this for my mother-in-law. She really likes it. I think it is perfect for those nimble enough who want to keep on the move. But don't need lots of support. It is steady but not as steady as the four wheel ones. Although they are bulkier and take up more space. This one is lite and folds nicely and the basket is perfect for the many different possible items one generally needs. There are many walkers out there, but you will not go wrong choosing this one."
2,"Drive, Winnie lite, three wheel rollator","I ordered the Winnie Lite because of its small size and light weight. Small size, light weight and well constructed it is. The major dra back is it is very un- stable and can get away from you. Forget about using it outside for walks, long or short, not possible, if the front wheel was somehow inling with the rear wheels, it could obtain more stability. For someone that depends on a walker, I would say be carfull."
4,Zippy!,"I purchased this for my grandmother and she loves it. She'd always been opposed to the larger walkers, but this one with the hand brakes was perfect! It was basically all put together when we got and she uses it every where she goes."
5,Winnie Walker,"I purchased a Winnie Walker about a month ago in an effort to aid my balance while walking. I have been pleased with the Walker and it has helped me when walking for exercise in my neighborhood. It is easy to maneuver and gives me stability. And it is quite nice looking, as well. I recommend this Walker to all as an aid to walking in comfort and style."
5,Terrific little rollator,"This is a wonderful little rollator for a small adult. I am 5'3"" and it suits my frame well. I'm not sure a 6' person would feel comfortable, however, even with the handles raised. This little rollator is light weight so that it is easliy loaded into a vehicle. I have a larger 4-wheel rollator that I can barely get into a trunk by myself, so this is a big improvement. It is small enough to fit into the back seat of my SUV which the 4-wheel model did not. So far, I have not felt insecure with only the 3 wheels, but have not had it on uneven ground yet. The frame is sturdy, the vinyl bag is spacious, and the brakes work well. The flame red is snazzy. I believe the weight listed in the product description at 4.8 lbs is wrong. Other sellers and sites list the weight as 9 lbs, and that feel true."
5,excellent portability,"I have purchased this for two seniors, one 94 and one 77. Both love its portability and ease of use."
2,the three wheel,I had to return this item my mother said it is not stable at the turn that could be because of her age. Unfortunatly she could not use it.
5,Great piece of equipment with terrible instructions!!,"The Winnie Lite is a wonderful, maneuverable lightweight but sturdy item. I've purchased two - one for my mom and another for a friend who needed a lightweight walker. The instructions, however, are terrible!! When the 2nd unit arrived the wheel base appeared to be very short, making the unit very unstable. Only after feeling like I had steered my friend towards a bad unit did I notice that the wheel base can, and needs to be extended to bring the wheels out to their correct position. This is not shown in the instructions, nor is it obvious from looking at the unit. Had I not already purchased one for my mom I would have thought it a terrible device. So I highly recommend this item, but make sure you pull the wheels out to their correct position (slide the bottom leg supports away from the front of the unit until a button clicks into place)!"
4,winnie walker,i am so pleased with my new winnie walker. it helps taking pressure off my back and leg. ican walk so much longer and still feel comfortable. this is the best thing i did for my health--i can walk for health!i am so grateful to my friend who bought w.w. afew months ago and suggested w.w. might be the amswer to my walking problem.how right she was--advertising would make more people aware of this wonderful product.you would be doing a service to the many seniors that have a problem walking.
5,HELPFUL PRODUCT,THIS 3 WHEEL WALKER IS EXCELLENT. IT'S LIGHT ENOUGH TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE BACK SEAT AND STURDY ENOUGH TO FEEL SAFE ON RAMPS ETC. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.
4,Excellent product: flawed instructions,"Very happy with the product: supportive & easy to maneuver. Appears very well made & finished. Assembly more difficult than need be, because the four locking knobs (packed separately) were initially difficult to screw in. And the instruction manual, beautifully printed in three languages, lacked needed assembly diagrams, and also contained info on features my unit doesn't have i.e. a parking loop lock."
4,Great Rollator,"Drive Winnie Lite Supreme Aluminum 3 Wheel Rollator w/ Loop Locks - BlueThis a great rollator (walker), you can use it to go any where. It is very light weight and easy to get in and out of your car. The only thing I recommend is to buy the extra basket because the bag attached is not that large."
4,It was still to big.,"I purchased this walker for my 79 year old mother. Her physical therapist suggested this style might work better for getting around the house. The only problem she has is that it is still to big (the back) to get through the doors of her older home. It works great for her stability and it is much lighter than her other one.I would recommend this to anyone with stability problems, I just would suggest you measure your door frames to make sure it will fit without problems."
5,Great,This small walker is very easy to use. Small but a little heavier than most like this. Perfect for taking out to dinner.It folds so it can go between chairs without bothering servers. Works well in crowds and church because of it's size!
5,"My ""tricycle""","I love this product, have used it every day for going out to check mail and get paper down drive, load it into the car to use for shopping, library and Dr. visits. It's durable and seems very safe, stays clean and jaunty."
4,Driver medical Winnie Lite 3 wheel roller,Very helpful getting around indoors and outdoors especially if you are of short stature. the handles extend upward which enables me walk without bending over.
1,Tagalong dog bike carrier Doesn't fit my bike,I am sooooo bummed; my carrier just arrived. I have a Trek Road bike and it doesn't fit at all. Have any one had this problem and/or is there any suggestions on modifying it to fit????
2,Potentially very dangerous,I bought this for my dog who weighs a little over 12 pounds. The support rack for basket is very week & dropped to wheel top during first ride in parking lot. If I had taken it on the road or for more than a few feet my dog could have been seriously injured. The carrier storage design is good but support resulting safety issues are scary!
1,What a nightmare! FALSE INFORMATION!,"This purchase has been a nightmare from the begining! Ordered from Amazon, who ordered from Revival, who ordered from Solvit. # of shipping days changes after you place you order and you can't track package because it's too hard to find the correct person to get a tracking #. I found my 4 # Yorkie paralized the day my basket arrived and he underwent a 2 hour neck surgery a few days later. We will not be able to use our basket now and I'm very unhappy to find that I must return the basket to Solvit who has a 12 % restocking fee. I was never given this information on the site that I ordered from.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FALSE INFORMATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!!!!!! I will never order from Amazon again."
4,SUSE Networking made simple,"A good book for beginning a network with SUSE but not very much info on networking to anything other than Linux and Unix. Perhaps that was intentional. Be that as it may, it truly did help me set up a small Linux network in short order. It guided me through DNS problems I was having and cut through DHCP in Linux like butter! Chapters on Gateways and Security are really helpful. If a large Linux network is needed, this book would be just as helpful, because all the info still applies. If I had to do it all over again, I would buy this book because the down to earth style of writing, clear explainations of Linux terms and usage of the command interface. I would have given it 5 stars, but I was hoping for a little more info on networking with Windows products. I highly recommend this book to those who have chosen SUSE as their brand of Linux who are interested in networking Linux machines."
5,"Incredible voice, and a great album!","I just happened to be at my parents home when this CD arrived. She opened it, and we began listening to it. Talk about heavenly! I've never heard of Daniel O'Donnell until then. I haven't purchased a CD for my mother, or myself in quite awhile. It's been a long time since I've heard such a crystal clear, and beautiful voice. We took the CD with us on our trek into town. We couldn't get enough of this CD! If I do one special thing for myself, it will ordering a CD of Daniel O'Donnell for myself, and probably another family member as well. Highly recommended for sure."
2,It Has Gone TOO Far....,"...I am talking about southern rap. I can dig Lil John and the Eastside Boyz a bit, because they are straight up in why they make music. All Lil John and his crew wants to do is party and get things crunk. But David Banner is trying to come off as hard-core and serious. The beats are alright, but I had to shake my head at some of his lyrics. The worst part about this cd are the ""guests"" who rap with David. Hell, they made the cd worst.Its funny because all my friends from Mississippi keep hollaring about how David Banner is putting Mississippi on the map and how Mississippi is coming up to challenge the ATL as the music capital of the south. All I can say is: ""those who dream fast will lose fast."""
2,Same ol' Hook,"Seriously this guy sounds like another Pastor Troy and Lil John. I heard his single off ""Ruff Ryders Vol. 3"" and his single on there was tight, but after I spent some money on his album and listened to it, I demanded my money back. IF your into the 2 artist I listed above, you will like the album, but don't expect a major difference in style or beats."
3,MISSISSIPPIS TIME 2 SHINE,Tha cd is tight but you will get tired ov it quick. I only like 5 lil songs on the cd and im tired ov them already. So if you wondering about buying this cd I think you should just burn a copy or download off tha enternet or get tha screwed and chopped version.
3,l luvd a few songs,"i luvd a few songs, but the rest didn't appeal to, although he kept real for those in his city and state."
3,Good Album - Just one bad song,"David Banners album titled ""Mississippi"" is IMO a good album. I like the sound of his hard voice and hard beats. The only thing that I absolutely hate is the song ""Bush"" He blames america for all his problems and the problems of African Americans. This, To me, Makes him sound like a retard because he really does not know what he is talking about. I recommend buying this album, but make sure to skip over the song ""Bush"" as it will make you feel disgusted for buying the album."
1,COMPLETE RAP GARBAGE!!!,I listened to this cd from a friend of mine and it had to be one of the worst rap albums of all time and ive heard many.How could anyone like this cd when all the songs sound the same and the production is bad?He sucks and he knows it because he has to feature millions of people to rap on his album.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS CRAP!!!
3,DAVID BANNER,"THIS CD IS COOL IF YOU GOT A NICE SYSTEM IN UR CAR BUT IF NOT,I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS. IT STARTS OFF GOOD BUT DOESNT END THAT WAY.OUT OF 19 TRACKS I LIKED 10. SO ITS AT LEAST WORTH PICKING UP AND ADDING TO UR CD COLLECTION"
1,"David Banner is nothing behind 'Like a Pimp""","When 'Like a Pimp' hit the radio, I thought to myself, this CD is gonna be cold. But when I bought it, I realized I was wrong. Dead wrong. Almost every single song on this CD is complete trash. This really dissapointed me considering how good 'Like a Pimp' was. Besides Like a Pimp, the only track worth listening to (worth listening to maybe three or four times) is F**k em, and that isn't that great considering how repetitive it is. Really, don't waste your money. Buy Like a Pimp on iTunes and you'll be much better off."
3,Alright CD..,"The first six songs seem to live up to the motto of ""Southern Rap"" but going further into the album, David's songs seems to take a more softcore R&B tone to them...ok album, hope his next one is better."
2,OverRated,"This album is over-rated. Almost all of his tracks have someone singing the chorus, there aren't but two crunk songs on the cd. all the others are slow beats. Now I see why he released ""Like a Pimp"" as his first single because its probably the best song on the cd, other than the one with Pastor Troy. Banner could have brought more to the table."
4,"This is a good CD, but not quite what I hoped.","I got this CD, because I like the song ""Like a Pimp"". However, when I heard the CD, I wasn't THAT impressed, cause a lot of the songs were slow and boring. I do like the songs ""What It Do"", ""Might Getcha"", ""Like a Pimp"", and F... 'Em"". The other songs are ok, but not my favorite. The CD is good. It's a lot better than Insane Clown Posse. I respect David Banner for his strong belief in God and for making a strong effort to set a good rep for Mississippi."
4,My Shawty,this album is full of krunk and deep cuts check it out i got this cd cuz i of store credit and it didnt dissapoint go pick it up new south8 of 10 lyrics 8.5 of beats
5,"a seductive, sensual, and sensative recording","this is some of sadao watanabe's best work....although sadao doesn't play a lot of notes....he plays his notes with grace and mellowness....the rhthym section is great...nice textures...and of course roberta flack is always superb...next to sadao's ""fill up the night"", this is one of his best pieces of work."
4,"Macho gets a break, Hogan takes a back seat","Savage takes the gold, Warrior breaks a chain and Honky Tonk man continues his 2 year streak. Battle royal at the begining isn't too bad with the Hitman and Bad News in a heel clash. Hogan vs Andre 3."
3,Your basically paying for a catalog,"All this book is, is a catalog. It has some pictures that may be useful for layout, but it doesn't tell you what the plants are in the drawings. If you want this information, you have to buy the specific plan on the page. Makes me wonder why you have to buy this book then."
3,Mixed Reviews,"I bought this because we own My Daddy Is Scratchy and the kids love it. I am overall underwhelmed with this CD. Some of the songs are great (Are We There Yet is the best)and some are not so interesting. I think that the kids will like it better once they've heard it a few more times, but right now it is just so/so for them. I listen to the tunes for each age and think they are cute because they do nail the characteristics of kids that age so well, but as songs to listen to over and over- I just don't see that happening."
5,Replace parenting books with one CD,"Sure, the music is catchy and lyrics are funny, but the real reason to put this at the top of the family car CD rotation is that after a few listens you will feel better about yourself as a parent, your kids will feel better about themselves, and you'll all be singing along to the chorus of ""Are We There Yet?"" (my favorite).As a bonus, you can throw away the whole shelf of parenting books; this album has songs for and about all ages (OK, ages 1 to 8 particularly), with devastatingly precise portrayals of each age. ""I Am Five"" and ""I'm Six"", for example, are completely different songs, but just from the titles alone you can spot the crucial distinction, the confident use of a contraction by the six year old. Now go and listen to the songs.The album ends with a promise that ""we'll have to finish the story some other time"". I can't wait."
2,You can have my copy,"This CD reminds me of the mediocre musical theatre that I used to feel compelled to sit politely through because my best friend was in the cast. I listened (politely) to the whole thing before consigning it to the box for the church rummage sale. It's probably too sophisticated to appeal to little kids but it's not sophisticated enough for adults. I frankly found it a little irritating. But what do I know? I can't stand ""The Wheels on the Bus,"" either."
4,What a great showman mr. oler is,"The long wait is over, my cd has arrived and I have palyed it over and over. What a great talent Newell possesses. He is a nature peformer in the purest sense. He knows how to make the keys sing, like in sing for you and for me.The icing on the cake is the fact that Newell and I share the same Texas town. Newell was born in Tyler, Texas and moved away at a young age. I was born else where, but moved to Tyler upon graduation from college. It's too bad that we didn't live in this wonderful town at the same time.To get back to my review is easy. This cd offers country music performed in a romantic style of play. It doesn't sound that country, but still should have some appeal to country music lovers. Newell did an outstanding job with this project. He also choose a great repertoire to perform.Recommendation: I think this is a cd that most romantic fans can enjoy."
4,Brilliant except for 2 cuts,"Buscando America - the title cut is just absolutely amazing. It literally brings tears to my eyes sometimes when I hear it. And I don't even speak the language. So I apologize if i'm missing some of the beauty in the lyrics. I'm coming at it purely for the music, arrangements, and emotion. The music is just brilliant and the singing is emotional and evocative. I'd probably ball like a baby if I could speak the language.Padre Antonio Y... is a great cut as well. Some of the music (on the album) is extremely sophisticated and particularly engaging.Cuts #2, and #3 don't really turn me on that much but all the rest are great stuff. That's the reason for the 4 stars rather than 5. But still... Highly recommended"
4,Great,It Is Awesome!!! the problem is it came with scratches :( but only a little bit so it is alright!!!
5,Crucial reading for Rorty students,Rorty is a love/hate philosopher. I love him so there is your full disclosure.Love him or Hate him ORT is important reading. If you read nothing but PMN and ORT you would be well equiped to begin your apology/critique.
2,Needs some serious editing...,"This book needs a lot of editing, since in it's present form it wanders aimlessly and without purpose for pages and pages before anything of substance occurs. The book and its attempt to explore the spirit world seems like a spirit: hard to grasp and unsatisfying. For better literature on Vietnam, try Le Le Hayslip's ""When Heave and Earth Changed Places,"" which has its feet on the ground (despite the title) and a much greater emotional impact."
1,Horrid read!,"I thought this book was terribly dull and uninteresting. I had to read this for a college course and was deeply disappointed in the material and the story line. I had to literally force myself to stay awake and read another sentence. Yes, it was that bad. I do not reccomend this book to anyone. In fact I have warned avid reads, like myself, to never pick the book up. I am a reader who likes thick plots, action, mystery, everything but what this book had to offer.I do not think I learned anything that opened my mind to another culture or about life in general. The book jumped around a lot between present and past and it was easy to get confused and disinterested. Not to be too harsh but: horrible, horrible, horrible! Save yourself the time, money, and effort. Read another book."
5,Gorgeous Imagery + Highly Engaging Story = 5 Stars,"Lan Cao has written a masterpiece. ""Monkey Bridge"" successfully explores a complex mother-daughter relationship and details Vietnamese culture and the South Vietnamese immigrant experience. Even without a highly engaging story, however, this book deserves attention for Cao's beautiful use of langauge. Reading ""Monkey Bridge"" is like reading the most exquisite poetry. Easily 5 stars."
3,A story that doesn't quite work,"This book is nicely crafted, with a simple story about a beautiful cat. I like it, but for some reason it did not capture my 6 yo's imagination or attention, despite her extreme interest in Egypt, pyramids, mummies, hieroglyphics and even deserts. My daughter thought the temple cat was a golden cat, in Egypt, and a sad cat. So she got the basic premise, but just hasn't been keen to read this, unlike other books that have captured her completely."
1,Weak and disheveled,"I am a disaster movie buff, and for a good disaster, I can forgive a lot. But Terror Peak doesn't make the cut, by a wide margin. The story is disheveled, with very little glimpse of good volcano activity, and too much running around scared and ""human concern"". There is only one really good scene, where three people are darting among small ground explosions caused by gaz bursts, trying to get to safety. The whole part of Melanie and the guide stuck in a cave, running up and down for an exit, with vapor and fumes amok, is laughably contrived, and drags on for much too long. SeeDante's Peakfor a much better volcano pic."
3,It's Got Lynda Carter in it!,"It's Got Lynda Carter in it! OK, OK, I am a huge Lynda Carter fan and anything with her in it will get my attention, if not me buying a copy of it! A bit predictable but... It's Got Lynda Carter in it! }:o)"
1,ok,"I was looking for a memory book that was like a three ring binder to add page protectors and photos, etc...this book does not have that."
1,Ricoh stinks as a printer AND a company.,"The printers that these photo conductors go in, are terrible. This particular unit, I was only able to print 1500 copies before it started to get lines in it. The waste toner removal system plugs and screws up the whole work. You have to have it in a climate controlled room, otherwise humidity above about 60% does it in. Have had 3 such units in the printer plus 2 color PC units. Do yourself a favor and buy a Brother or even an HP, just not a Ricoh.The company would not do anything for me either. They are the worst. Spend your money elsewhere. Wish someone told me that before I bought one!"
2,All the pages are Green and hard to write on... BORING!,"We buy a lot of educational workbooks for our kids. This was one of the worst.- Too much info/questions stuffed on each page. It's just too busy visually.- Each page is green! Boring.- The pages are some kind of glossy magazine/book paper that is hard to write on with a pencil. Marker rubs off on my kids' hand!Don't buy. Go to the bookstore, touch the math workbook and pick out a good one."
5,Easy math book,"Parents aproved, kids do not like it cause of the extra work they have to do, however we as a parents love it, keeps the child touble free and busy."
3,Could Have Been Even Better,"I really like this worbook and would give it more stars if only they changed a couple of things. My child gets very frustrated when he needs to erase a mistake because the paper is glossy. His paper ends up looking smudged and sloppy and he hates it. The other thing he dooesn't like is that the pages aren't perforated and it is almost impossible to tear them out without ripping them. The pages aren't colorful, but my son doesn't seem to mind that. My child is homeschooled and I use this book as a supplement to his regular math curriculum."
4,Making math fun,"Purchased this gift for my niece that prefers dancing, finger polish and art- although I doubt it will turn her into a math whizz my sister tells me that the star stickers included motivate her to complete the each page and she is improving."
4,"Good review for standardized tests, and skill evaluation","We got this to supplement our daughter's Math studies, and it is very colorful and fun! It contains gold stars for every lesson completed, and when you're done, you have a chart full of stars to keep! A great help for parents working with their kids during a big year for six and seven year olds! The price is great and the quality is typical of DK...top-notch. You would pay closer to twenty dollars for something like this in a ""teacher"" store."
4,The title says it all!,"This curriculum has been our math staple for the past 3 years now. The only thing missing is some of the basic instruction for new or difficult concepts. But if you know basic math, then you can cover what's lacking with no problem. Hopefully this has laid the foundation for when we move on to Saxon..."
4,FOLLOW THE LEADER,"Following in the footsteps of the first release, ""START 'EM YOUNG"". ""LUCKY STREAK"" continues to prove why Heavy Metal ruled the world in the 80's. Powerful vocals, screaming guitars, pumping bass, and pounding drums melted together in a collection that would make any headbanger bang all night. SO PLAY IT LOUD, MUTHA, you won't be dissapointed."
4,nice product,"This is a good product if pain doesn't bother you. It is just like ripped off a band aide but with long lasting results. I mean, two months is pretty good. No problems other then being helpful because I do not have to shave. Less hair did grow back as well."
3,Good Songwriting/Average Recording,"It's too bad this one was their first. There are some great songs on it. Unfortunately, this band did not peak until they learned to use the studio. Obviously, the crash hot sounds from Our Time In Eden were just a technical impossibility at the time this one was released. Natalie Merchant's voice can only carry a band of very average musicians so far. So, if you're a fan, this is a must have, but if it's your first ten grand LP, then buyer beware - there is a reason you can find this one in all the bargain bins."
4,Magical Maniacs,"To me this is undoubtedly a less accessible album than the Maniacs' more pop-focused later work, but is all the more appealing for it. The album has a loose, varied and idiosyncratic feel to it, which is after all what the Maniacs were always about. Pop, folk and new wave rock blend with intelligent lyrics, producing that distinctive Maniacs sound, and an excellent re-interpretation of the English ballad 'Just As The Tide Was A-flowing'. Although the musicianship is not that remarkable, the real strength is Nathalie Merchant's voice. In turns beguiling, vulnerable, harsh or seductive, it is always beautiful. For me just the first thirty seconds of 'Among the Americans' represents Nathalie Merchant and the 10,000 Maniacs at their ethereal, sensitive, spine-tingling best."
4,Good addition to the Teenage Crush series,"Just another good mixture of oldies from ACE. I bought this mainly for Primrose Lane by Jerry Wallace, but don't think it sounds like the original I remember. So this one disappointed me a little, but it's still close enough to the original to be enjoyable. Also, I haven't yet seen that song on any other oldies CD collection. Also, the sound quality on this one is excellent, and typical of all ACE CD's."
3,"Teenage Crush, Vol. 3","I got this for Girl of My Best Friend, but there wasn't much else that I liked that I didn't already have."
5,A truly important release,"Canned Heat was an important band, fusing hippie psychedellia with raw, electric blues and boogie. They were one of America's few answers to the British blues dominance of the period.This release came at a pivital time in the band's personal history, soon after the death of founding member Al Wilson. Featured replacement Joel Scott Hill's guitar approach took them into new directions.It is also the last recordings by Canned Heat's Henry Vestine, one of the the most under-rated guitarists of his time. Listen to the lengthy track 'Utah' as proof of this man's incredible and unique talent.Little Richard's involvement is minor but enjoyable.While I own many releases by Canned Heat, this one stands alone in both quality and importance."
2,String Quartet cd,"J'Anna Jacoby is so talented (Rod Stewart's Royal Albert Hall DVD) that it's unfortunate whoever put this together ""really blew it.""This is NOT a refection of her marvellous talents...Sorry J'Anna, your talents absolutely shine in Rod's concert... I looked forward to each song nearly as much to hear your ""soulful fiddle,"" as to hear Rod.billRe: String Tribute to Rod Stewart"
3,Not enough tracks to make a valid compilation,"Since this group released 5 albums, and CDs have a nearly 80 minute capacity, it's dumb to put together a compilation of an obscure group like this and only have 7 meager songs. Where is Dancer? Where is Sad But Rich? Where is Fascination and Elusive? This only gives a small taste of the band."
1,Julio Cortes is a Catholic Christian,Julio Cortes is a Catholic Christian . It is a priest of the church. His translation of the Quran is full of interpretations. I do not recommend this translation for anything. It's much better to buy a translation done by a native Muslim.Es un cura de la iglesia. Su traduccion del Coran esta lleno de sus interpretaciones. No recomiendo esta traduccion para nada. Es mucho mejor comprar una traduccion hecho por un musulman nativo.
5,The funniest show this century,"This is one of the most entertaining, hilarious programmes we have ever had the good fortune to watch. ""Just as Frasier would say""It is well worth the your time. If you want or need a good laugh this is the show. We have watched all the shows and have purchased the DVD's for future entertainment."
5,A Very Complete Resource,"This book is perhaps the most complete reference I've used to orient myself to the nature of the disease of Prostate Cancer. Naturally a tad biased to the surgical solution (Dr Scardino is one of the highest rated Prostate Surgeons in the country), it delivers a wealth of information. Knowledge is power, and if you or a loved one have Prostate Cancer, you owe it to yourselves to read this book, and to research the topic in depth."
5,"A New Book, the Latest Information","When serious medical problems arise, it is a confusing time and we are often called upon to make immediate decisions that will affect us for the rest of our lives. Quite possibly the two most common illnesses that cause this situation is breast cancer for women and prostate cancer for men.In this book, one of the premier surgeons specializing in the area, talks about both the disease and its treatment. There are many treatments, including drugs, radiation and of course surgery. All of these are discussed, although there seems to be a slight bias towards surgery. The book was published in April of 2005, this allows the most recent drugs and treatments to be covered, including some that are still in the test stages.Above all else, this book will help when these tough decisions have to be made. It's a lot more information than you'll get out of your own doctor."
5,For Men,"This is the most comprehensive and understandable review of prostate issues I have read. With the information in Dr. Scardino's book, any man will be able to ask more pertinent questions and participate more knowledgeably in the therapy and treatment of prostate problems."
5,Prostate Book - Scardino,I was recommended to read this book by another eminent urologist who said it was the best book available on this subject. It covered everything one needs to know very thoroughly and I was very satisfied with the quality of information included.
3,"Great Song, High Price","This song is really great, Good beat and lyrics, buy the price is a little high for just one song. I recommend buying his CD ""The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book"" instead. It has this track as well as 15 other really great ones. You only pay a few more dollars and it's well worth it."
2,"911 isn't a joke, but......","Sorry, folks, but I can't like this song no matter how hard I try. I understand the intriguing love message behind it, but the beat is played over and over and over again, something I can't stand, one reason I have little interest in R&B."
1,Incomplete Film,"I saw this movie during its' original release. This film is well done in every way, acting, story, suspense and it is riveting. Since I gave it one star you must be wondering why. This movie is unfinished. It needs at least another 10 minutes maybe more. Just as this movie was reaching a suspenseful peak, it ended. No resolultion, no nothing. I have enjoyed movies that made you think, that didn't spoonfeed the audience an ending and explanation. This is NOT what happens here. Even for a mystery ending, they have to have a mystery ending. Watching this movie is like watching the first movie in the Alien series and having it end abruptly just as they are about to interrogate what is left of the robot Ash. Great up to that point, but incomplete.The way this movie ends makes it a complete waste of time. Save yourself the aggravation and STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!"
1,Never received,"I had never received this item(you send me a leather pouch instead of the charger!!) and it last 2 weeks more that you estimate .. also, it was very expensive!!! ...."
4,Very Basic Review,"The review is very basic. The material is presented in a clear fashion. I bought them but did not use them. The price has dropped since I bought it. If you like watching things over video, this is for you. It is better than the classes, I think, since it teaches the material covered unlike the classes, which teaches only some of the material covered (they expect you to learn the majority of it or review the majority of it from books they give you) and the other half to three quarters is guided practice. So, I'd recommend this over the courses."
2,The Dutch version of new wave,"There are some ok songs on this cd but over all the feeling I get is that most are weak in melody and structure and the distorted vocals are annoying. I think the Nits wanted to sound more and more like the Beatles and I stopped enjoying the Beatles a long time ago. The lead singer has a distinctive Dutch accent when singing in English. More interesting the Nits albums were Tent and the follow up. I don't remember the title because both albums are not available anymore, which is a shame because they are decent new wave albums for a Dutch band. None of the songs are featured on this ""best off"" cd. That's another shame."
4,It's like coming out of amnesia!,"For years I had wandered around with many questions in my mind that were unanswered; why am I on earth? What is the purpose of life? Who is actually telling us something that resembles the truth? This book really the cleared my mind of the clutter I had acumulated in over 45 years. Everything really started clcking in my mind about why we are actually here on earth and what is that place called ""The Other Side"". Thanks Tom, you really made a difference in my day to day living practices. It's as if you brought me back out of amnesia, after many years of being unconcious."
5,cuisine rapide,"I have two copies of this book already. One at home and one at our vacation place. This is a gift. I own many dozens of cookbooks. This is one of my favorites for quickly prepared delicious food made of ingredients easy to find in any urban area . When we used to rent a home in France in the summers, I used to keep a copy there, too. It's an exceedingly useful addition to anyone's kitchen library."
4,STRANGE AND FUNNY!!!!!,"I bought this cd for one reason and one reason ONLY...for the song ""Strange and Funny""!!! I think the vocal and the arrangements were sheer brilliance in an original way; the way it supposed to be done!! The rest of the cd is good as well but I wanted that song and I got it!!Ya Dig??"
2,Hirt's (Hurts) them to get orders correct.,"Hirt's I have ordered from twice. Both times a sad failure.Product picture shows 2-4-0.5, The product I received is 2-4-0.Not a large difference, but the fact is that they don't list the ratios in thedescription, so the picture is all we can go by. Don't even get me started onmy other order from this supplier. Just find a better supplier for your indoor/outdoorgarden needs."
4,"""the heart of Jamaica's sound system ~ Dillinger""","Hip-O brings a masterful album to the forefront ""Dillinger:Ultimate Collection"", featuring some of the tastiest tracks ever to grace an essential Reggae release ~ cleverly executed rhymes that seem to fall into place as if by design.

1,Not the Same Product.,"My vet instructed me to get Zinpro from Lincoln Biotech to supplement my dog for Zinc responsive dermatosis. After giving him the ORIGINAL Zinpro from Lincoln Biotech I switched to this NutriVed Zinpro for Dogs because the price was a alittle better and thought I could save myself some money. It is not the same! NutriVed Zinpro for Dogs is alot cheeper but it must not have the same quality of Zinc as the Zinpro from Lincoln Biotech. His itchys started to come back and the redness reappeared. I learned my lesson. You get what you pay for. I switched back to Zinpro from Lincoln Biotech. I pay more, and my dog is happier."
2,zinc tabs,"My dog will absolutely not eat these tablets! She is not a picky eater by any means as her physique cleary shows, but I can't get her to eat these no matter how I disguise them. I bought regular zinc supplements from walmart and she eats them with no problem."
2,Not much to this book,"I was expecting more stunning pictures and detailed photos to accompany the articles but was disappointed by the content, a good starter book about black art history for teenagers maybe."
1,Not a fan of the arts,"I really want to appreciate the arts, but this book doesn't help. Too much race-baiting, not enough pictures, and overall very boring. Only reason I got it was cuz it was for school."

1,Flash Costume,"This is a poorly made, over priced costume. It did not withstand a single washing, and the store offered no support other than to give me the contact information of the manufacturer. Better ways to spend $50."
1,Terrible Service,"I purchased the CD version, installation went ok. Then, I double-clicked on the WebEasy icon. Nothing. Program startup hangs. Uninstalled, and tried using the downloaded version from Avanquest. Same problem. I've not been successful in getting through to tech support. After two calls that were on hold nearly 1.5hrs total, I give up. By the way, the computer is a smoothly performing Toshiba TabletPC, with XP Pro. All other sofware on it works fine. I finally got through to a Customer Service rep, who basically had excuses about why there wasn't tech support available. Hard to imagine that a company can be successful in the long run if it doesn't take care of its customers.They did seem to have an easy way to get a refund, which I'm likely to try."
1,Very poor software!,"I consider myself fairly computer literate, but I could not get to grips with this product. I have used MS FrontPage in the past and wanted a replacement. However ""WebEasy 7"" is not it.I found it badly thought out, difficult to use and cannot recommend it. The seller will not take it back. Beware!"
2,Webeasy7,"With WebEasy7, you get what you pay for. It's an ok program for web design, but it has it flaws. For someone who knows very little about HTML or web design in general, it may be a good way to get a site going. There doesn't appear to be any way to edit the HTML code. There are some features that I was pleased with, such as some of the dynamic HTML effects that allow pictures to fade in and out, etc. but the program in general can be difficult to work with on the other hand. It's far from great but not terrible either."
4,"Very nice, simple to use until...","I've created two beautiful websites although I must emphasise that mine are very basic using the included templates. I've not tried all the ""bells & whistles.""My one complaint so far is that I'm ready to build and put it online, but cannot find ANYWHERE what the charge for that will be. I'm not about to sign up for something until I know the costs involved. And, as noted by others, support is limited to the user manual and requires patience & fortitude sometimes to no avail. Don't expect to actually get personal tech support here."
1,don't waste your time,"I thought that I would have my site up and running in a few days giving myself more time than a few hours.I ran into several problems and contacted customer support. They are not willing at all to assist saying to read the instructions. After I told them I wasted my money, they were more willing to help.Fast forward to two weeks ago. My site stopped working, so I contacted customer support again and received a quick reply saying that they will be in touch in two days. I still have not been contacted and actually bought another copy to load over the existing copy. I am going to take it back and get web developing software that actually works.Don't waste your time or money!!!!!"
2,"great product for a novice, but terrible customer service","I was able to build a nice website using this product no thanks to any manuals or tech support (which is non existent). If you call their number (which is NOT Toll free) expect to wait almost an hour on hold. I have the professional edition and apparantly tech support does not deal with. So... after an hour on hold before reaching a human, I was told to use email. They also will answer one email and usually a form letter response. Don't expect any more from them. If I had more technical skills I would definitely upgrade to a better program than this one!!"
2,DO NOT USE THEIR E-COMMERCE,The software works greatWhat ever you do STAY AWAY from CHARGE.COM. It is included and encouraged to be used for e-commerce using Web Easy software. They are a scam taking money from tens of thousands of people. Go to google and type in charge.com also known as pipeline data and Cts holdings They are all the same company and start reading the nightmares people have dealt with.
1,Too many bugs,"First frustration was program locking up quite often. Second is that text and graphics positioned on the design page don't always end up in the exact same position when you ""build"" the site (basically a preview of what it is going to look like on the web). The final straw was uploading the file and finding out it would only load an older version of the file. The file name remained the same, but none of the new material we added and saved is there. It's there when you are working with the file, but it's missing when you upload. Not even going to try tech support based on all the unfavorable reviews."
3,"Does the job, but a little lite on features","The program works fine, not to many bells and whistles would like more functions up front and not hidden in a bunch of menus. Would buy for price again but recommend a newer version."
2,Will not retain your license number.,"Product works very well UNTIL they release a new version. I was happy with this item until it started to not retain my license number. I then went to WebEasy 8 and after a few months they released WebEasy9 and guess what? Yep WebEasy 8 would not work. I contacted the company and their answer is ""we have released verison 9 you need to upgrade to WebEasy 9 "" What ???? This is a rip off. I loved the product when it worked but I will NEVER buy from this company again. I have had two versions and both worked fine until they released a new version and your license won't work. The support from this company really sucks. They only want to sell you the next product in line. I feel if I BUY the product I own the product and they are just stealing my money. If you want software that works just for awhile then I would use this. If you want a software that is going to last, buy something else."
1,"Bad software, no support",The software is buggy. I had to figure out a number of work-arounds to get the looks and feel I wanted - and I was not trying to do anything fancy. Fonts and paragraphs look one way in the editor and some out differently when it goes to the Web. My disc drive crashed so I went back to them with my order number and product code. No luck. They would not let me re-download to my new disk drive. I would not recommend this product or the company to anyone.
1,Does not work on Windows 7 or in XP Compatibility mode!,"I bought this product, elsewhere, thinking it would be a great program. Well, it kept crashing my PC, which runs 64-bit Windows 7. Yes, it does state that it works on Windows 2000, XP and Vista, but not Windows 7. So, I tried running the program in Windows XP Compatibility mode! It kept asking me for the registration number every time I started the program! I tried going to the Avanquest website to request a refund. It asks for a UPC code and when I enter the UPC code, it tells me that it's invalid! So, I have sent an email to customer service asking for my money back. Don't waste your time buying this, if you have Windows 7!"
1,Beware of Avanquest in all ways,"They used to make good products, but they haven't kept up with the industry. Their website is screwy and changes prices according to what so-called ""deal"" or coupon you use. They force you into buying other software before you can download the product you want. And their CSRs are absymal and ask for information already on the email. Any software developer that has a lousy webpage can't be a good provider!Perhaps, buying through Amazon will make your purchase smoother, but I have major red flags about this company.Remember, if you have a problem with any Avanquest software, YOU are not the problem, the company and the software is. Get a refund and run like the wind."
2,Ok produce,Not 100% cellulose. Fits the mop handle. 100% cellulose if much better. Will have to look around for 100% cellulose.
2,"Great in print, needs revision in CD-ROM Format","NB: This review is for the CD-ROM only! First to get the obvious out of the way. If you are going to have a single dictionary of American English, this is it. But buy it in print if you want to access the full text. I have loaded it successfully, but NOT all of the roots links WORK. And etymology is just part of the fun (and the price tag) when buying a high-end lexicon. There are roots in both the Indo-European and Semitic sections that are not functional. Yes I tried exchanging the disk, yes I tried multiple reloads (in which all other sections worked), yes I tried customer service (the latter claimed that there were no known issues with the software.) Is the problem just for Windows XP? I do not know. I do know that I would like to own this once all the bugs are out. It is a shame that as of Nov 2003, they are not."
3,AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY-CD ROM,"GREAT RESOURCE BUT NOT ABLE TO ACCESS FROM WORD XP (2002). THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MANUALLY DO THIS, OTHERWISE A VERY GOOD DICTIONARY."
2,Does Not Work with Windows XP,"The printed dictionary is fantastic. The CD-ROM has a great interface but lacks information on how to load it onto your hard drive, so you must keep the CD-ROM in the computer at all times (bad). But worst of all it does not work with the XP office products---WORD--so why buy it."
2,Unaccetably slow on Pentium II even installed on hard disk,"I have a Pentium II PC. I installed the dictionary on my hard disk. Even after I bring up the dictionary, the response time for it to provide the entry for a word I want to look up is about 10 secs. I did an experiment (several times, with different words) to check the response time and it is never better than 8 or 9 secs; sometimes it is 15 secs. In comparison, the response time from the dictionary included in Encarta is only 1 sec and Encarta is accessing a CD-ROM; it is not on the hard disk. I even asked customer service if there was something I was doing wrong; they said Pentium II was a rather old model. Disgusted with this, I bought the Merriam Webster CD. Its response time is around 1 second or perhaps less."
3,Classic Toto,"Toto have been a popular rock band for 20 years. This is their first album which includes their best song ""Hold The Line"". Steve Lukather, the guitarist, is underated. Buy this album if you like Toto's other stuff or buy it just for ""Hold The Line"" and ""I'll Supply The Love"". Fans of Journey and Boston will like this classic album."
3,Ainsi est né la légende...,"Premier album auto-produit.Remarqué grce à ""Hold The Line,"" qui deviendra "" la "" chanson phare du groupe.D'autres Singles ont suivis : ""Georgy Porgy"" et ""I'll Supply The Love.""Cet album sera alors nominé au Grammy Awards en tant que "" meilleur nouvel artiste "", 4 millions d'exemplaires vendus, il devient mme disque de platine.Best : Georgy Porgy, Girl Goodbye , Angela, Child's Anthem, I'll supply The love.Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
2,Off to a Good Start,"Their self titled debut is steeped in period arrangements, and doesn't really hit the mark. Reminiscent of Little River Band, album contains too few bright spots and relies mainly on the repetitive beat of disco. This album is for Toto coniseurs only, and is a stepping stone to Hydra, which is by far their most brilliant work."
4,The best Toto album,"This is a curious band, because they manage to pen great songs and also bland ones, but there's almost none of the latter on this, their debut album. I got it on vinyl on '85, and I have not replaced it for the cd version yet, cause wryly it's not very common to run into it in Spain - here Toto IV is very often found at music stores, unlike this far more inspired album.Vinyl records used to have a better first side, but this time I disagree - second side, that begins with Goodbye Girl, is a little more enjoyable than the first one. Takin' It Back is a pretty ballad and leads us into one of the better songs (Rockmaker). After it comes the biggest hit, Hold The Line and the cutest slow song on the album, Angela, which seems to me have been unfairly overlooked.Toto had even biggest success with the mixed bag that is their fourth album, but to me their first is the best. Judge for yourself."
4,VERY NICE START,"boy oh boy, did most critics dump on these guys when this came out. Like some of the other reviewers said, ignore them. This is a very solid debut disc. The players in the band are all top shelf, including one of my favorite drummers, the late Jeff Porcaro. A groove master deluxe! Hold The Line, Georgy Porgy, Rockmaker, all solid songs. Nice productions as well. A nice addition to any collection."
5,"Highly infectious, meticulously crafted tunes","Almost every song on this album is darn near perfect. I mean, this is great stuff! Two very small exceptions: the words to ""Manuela Run"" don't seem to fit with most of Toto's love-based lyrics, but the music is kicking, and the guitar riff (which is awesome) that comes out of nowhere in ""Angela"" interrupts the continuity of the ballad and could easily be put to even better use in another song. Overall this album will appeal to everyone and will have them begging for more Toto."
5,Great Deal!,"Product works just wonderfully, I feel like this was well worth the price. 50 sheets of sea weed will last me for quite a long time, even though I have sushi almost once a week."
3,"Good sushi mat, gross nori","The sushi mat is fine, works great, the nori is disgusting, tastes super fishy. But I got it mostly for the mat so whatever."
2,A very expensive salad,"First up, the dressing didn't come with it.** Secondly, there are no English instructions. That's no hill for those of us that would buy this item, butI recommend another soak beyond what's in the illustrations. Next, it's all one big bag, so you only get one shot at it. I'd hoped it would've been packaged in 3 or 4 serving sizes.The taste? Good. **I had to really take a wild guess at what kind of dressing to use. I made my own soy based recipe.Finally, don't expect the free stuff in the Amazon ad. It wasn't there either.Save your money and head for your nearest Asian market."
1,"Cheap mat, nasty nori","The rolling mat is very cheaply put together, not impressed at all with it, wish I'd gone for a non-bundled mat, might have gotten a decent one. The nori is vile-tasting; I normally love nori with my sushi, but no one in my family, including me, could stand the stuff; we all ended up cutting the nori off (peeling left a residue on the rice) and eating the maki with a fork instead. A day in the fridge only strengthened the bad nori flavor. Awful stuff."
1,Meh...So-so,Not to knock this but to be honest the nori was under quality.The sushi mat was really cheaply made but what can i say for the price you get what you pay for *shrugs*
4,Novice,"I'm just learning to make sushi. First try was not successful, but I'm getting better. Since I have never used any other Nori, I really shouldn't rate."
4,Awesome,"I originally bought this for my friend, but hes over seas, so I wound up watching it. Great show, shipped well, no broken casing, or scratches on the disk. I thank you for such a nice thing~ as does my friend."
4,Different and fun,"I have watched a lot of anime and found this anime new and refreshing. I loved the art style and the characters were intriguing. The characters play off one another well and the dream world plot was done well. The story hints at Merry's background but doesn't flesh it out, also the series kinda leaves you hanging with the big bad and what he is up to, hopefully there is a sequel and more is revealed."
1,Unreliable operation,"When this product was first received, it was noted that the connections on top were too close together for easy connection. The high amperage (200) needs a substantial connection and it it difficult to do so with this configuration. I would have sent it back, except all the competitive units look similar. I finally designed a connection which would be reliable and not stress the connection points. The item was used for about 30 days with loads up to about 150 amps and then failed when the microwave oven was turned on. (This had been used many times before.) At that time the Inverter drew about 120 amps through this unit. I had the device for several months at that time, so it was too late to return it to the vendor and it was impossible to find the route to the manufacturer to get anything done that way. The coil appears OK, the thing makes the normal snap sound when it operates, but the contacts do not make up."
1,Not that great,"Although the book was well written, this is, in fact, a bias account of the war. This was a horrible sequence of events for the balkans, but according to the paradigms of historical data this conflict, without a doubt, was a civil war; therefore, pointing fingers at only one side is hypocritical to the war's designation. It's like having a reporter from the Soviet Union write a book on the U.S. civil war, claiming that the Union (the north) was to blame for everything and commited genocide against the Confederate States in the south. I would not recommend this this book."
1,most biased book ever written about the balkans,"this is one of the worst if not the worst book written about the wars of former yugoslavia. It is biased against the croatians and tries to make the serbs look like the innocent victims. It is a shame that this book was ever published and makes me wonder if the journalist ever did go to the former yugoslavia to research what went on. It is true that atrocities came from every side of the war, but the author seems to blame croatian's, as a whole took part while a few rogue serb generals where to blame for the whole serb population. I am not trying to push the blame on the serbs for this war, because there would be no war if there was nobody fighting back. everyone is equally guilty, i am glad that nobody wrote a review for this book, because i hope nobody will ever read this garbage."
1,Avoid This Book,"The author needed an editor. There are too many spelling and grammar errors to list. Also, there are logic and detail errors.My advice to anyone wanting to read a good book is to go find a different book. Avoid this book."
3,Dokken's darker side.........,"I am torn about this album. Sure it has some really good tunes, but it never really clicked with me. ""Alone Again"" is my favorite song here. And it's one of the songs that pioneered the power ballad as we know it today. ""Into The Fire"", ""Just Got Lucky"", & ""Tooth & Nail"" are the other hits here. They have a darker side to them though. This is easily one of Dokken's heavier releases. I know that ""Back For The Attack"" sounds a lot harder, but for it's time, this album was heavy. A lot of Dokken fans consider this (to this day) to be their best album. While I like it, I consider the next two far better. I still recommend this, though. Just don't expect to hear songs like ""In My Dreams"" or ""Burning Like A Flame""."
4,Great and short album,"What can I say for a second album by these guys. Dokken's breakthrough album would go platinum in the states and all over the world. A great short album, not their best but raw it is indeed.Into the Fire!"
4,An Air Guitarist's Delight,"1984,Superior, Wisconsin. This is the album that made all of us zit-faced little wanna-be guitar shredders want to buy an Aria Pro guitar. George Lynch gives a textbook lesson in how some guitar riffs are more memorable than the lyric of the song. Let's face it, Dokken was never one to shy away from cliche' lyrics but the ultra slick proto-metal production, catchy choruses, two-tone hair and the lyrical guitar work of Lynch make this a pre-requisite of Hair-Metal 101."
5,Old school metal masters,I had this cassette tape when I was 14. I looked everywhere for it. I now can relive my hair days.
1,Hair metal at its worst,"It's funny. All whom say this band was great, should bear in mind the following: I've watche one TV program, that talked about the hair-metal bands of the eighties, where George Lynch himself admmited that all Dokken did was copying the ohters, be it in musical terms, in wardrobe, wahtever!!So, TOOTH AND NAIL displays the worst hair metal could offer. Don Dokken sometimes can sin properly, but just the vision of the band in the booklet dressed like girls made wanna puck."
1,SO AWFUL I'M OUT OF WORDS...,"This is a typical garbage by Dokken. George Lynch is the only thing that is herable in this band, but he is playing with wrong purposes, be it: imitate other bands. Horrible."
5,vintage Dokken,george lynch is an absolute beast ... some of the finest Dokken i think they ever recorded...wore this out in high school...
3,for the brass ring,"This album has 3 of the best songs, not only from this band, but from the whole genre, and those would be the singles/videos. From there we have some pretty rudimentary, down the line tracks, not bad, but nothing too special. George blazes like VH and riffs like Iommi; all through the melodic lens of Tom Scholz; Don and Jeff are great with the melodramatics, but too much of it feels slapped down. The absolute gold of the above mentioned 3 was enough to put this deservedly over the top."
4,Classic melodic rock,"Some people think of Dokken as a wanna be band, never arriving at the superstar level, but for me they were, one of the best hard rock groups ever. Don Dokken's voice may not be the best on the business but it was back then far better than many others, and Geoge Lynch's guitar work remains strong and influential today. Ths is a great album all around. Recomended"
3,Bread,"I bought this because I love all the Bread hits. Lot of other songs I don,t like but I got rhe hits."
3,"Rock, ok, soft that is...","Great definition of '70s soft rock here, it does cover their career, though what would be considered classic career hits would not match the time when they came out."
5,Stale? I think not.,"The Editorial Reviewer sure was hard on this album, and I don't know why. Sure, Bread's sound as well as their lyrics were rather sweet. So what? They were love songs, for heaven's sake! Those somehow work a bit better when they generally are sweet.I think that anyone who can recall the person who was the object of their affection some twenty or more years ago at the time when ""Everything I Own"" was first heard probably feels pretty good about that song, and hearing it again brings back good memories. Ditto for ""Sweet Surrender"".Among my personal favorites are ""It Don't Matter to Me"" and ""Guitar Man"". Bread had a pleasing and gentle sound, and this anthology contains every one of their many wonderful hits. A must have for fans of music of the sevties and eighties."
4,The hits soar,"It is easy to think of Bread as the 1970s version of Air Supply, but the truth is a bit more complicated. They were actually decent songwriters who knew that a good hook is the key to great pop music. I'd compare them more to Abba, another band that was critically reviled in their day, but knew how to get under the skin with their skillful melodies. Bread didn't have nearly as many great songs as Abba, but cuts like ""Everything I Own,"" ""Guitar Man"" ""Make it With You,"" and ""Baby I'm a Want You"" have a definate resiliancy that elevates them above mere pop fluff.That having been said, ""Anthology"" is a bit overlong at twenty songs, and most listeners will likely find themselves skipping tracks. But the best of this material is well worth the price of admission."
5,Some of the Most Romantic Music Ever Recorded...,"...I mean, ""If"" gets my vote for world's greatest love song...Bread did it in the 60's and it still has that ""hmmmm...yeah"" quality about it. Those other jams--""Baby I'm-A Want You"", ""Everything I Own"" (think of how many times that's been sung in a song and it sounded as if it were really true? Gates gets plus, plus stars for that alone), ""Make it With You"", ""Sweet Surrender""--Getouttahere! This is good music. Groove with it."
3,"A Good Selection, Some of My Favorites.","This group headed by David Gates is not classic rock or even easy rock, as I heard ""Sweet Surrender,"" my favorites of their recordings on the Easy Listening FM in Huntsville, Alabama, years ago. For the life of me I simply cannot get the two ""adult standards"" stations FM or AM to play this particular recording. Why is it taboo? One plays way too much Doris Day, the other too much Enya with a bit of Michael Feinstein put in at odd hours. I miss most of his. MYL won't even play his now. ONly that maverick, the Winker, who is the Rebel and plays what he wants to come hell or hight water may insert one occasionally. Even he won't play ""Sweet Surrender."" I've gone through a few sweet surrenders in my time; they just don't know what they are missing by not trying it just once."
2,The Music That Gave 70's Music A Bad Name,"The punk rock movement of the late 70's was, in part, inspired by the type of insipid pop music that Bread embodied - fluffy, lightweight, and unchallenging. Bread and a host of other unchallenging pop bands had their fair share of radio airplay in the 70's. But a listen to their music now finds it hasn't stood the test of time.The easy-listening adult oriented radio stations that still play this pablum are going the way of the dinosaur. Other pop music of the era is far more enjoyable while still making a statement. If you're hankering for some 70's pop that leaves Bread flat in the oven, try the Carpenters, Carole King, Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell, and Gordon Lightfoot."
3,Love it,"Pure relaxation in a CD. If, Make it With You, Diary and If are classics lead by the emotion-evoking sound of David Gates. While not for everyone, Bread continues to hold its own among those music lovers who appreciate the softer side of the 70's music scene."
5,Dreams of Yesterday,"I completely agree with the previous reviewer in his scorn for Mr. Gdula's ill conceived review. This anthology of Bread has a wonderful, soft, dreamy quality about it. I had lost my earlier tape of this album, just bought this CD, and I am so glad I did. So many of these songs bring back delightful memories of the early 70's. The melodies and the lyrics can really grab you at a gut level, like ""If"", and ""Diary."" The others are just fun to hear again. A great album for just ""easy listening,"" and as background for romantic moments."
4,A TOAST...,"BREAD-ANTHOLOGY: The ultimate definition of ""soft rock"", David Gates and Bread could be enjoyed by teenagers and adults alike, hence the band's incredible across-the-board popularity in the first half of the 70s. AM radio fairly resounded with their wistful, non-confrontational ballads, though ANTHOLOGY demonstrates that occasionally a gruff Jim Griffin rocker like TRUCKIN' (not the Dead classic) broke up the peaceful pace. From the nifty wah-wah pedal punctuation of GUITAR MAN to the dulcet tones of harmony-laden hits like EVERYTHING I OWN, SWEET SURRENDER and IF, Bread's sound was instantly recognizable, offending no one other than brain-fried fans of the two chord/one idea rock dinosaurs so typical of the era. This 20 track collection of pure pop utopia would have been almost as good if it merely included their dozen biggest singles, but true fans will savor the chance to delve a little deeper into Bread's crust.RATING: FOUR CRUMBS"
3,Terrific Project BUT it's Missing One Key Song,"Classic Bread, but the classic song ""Mother Freedom"" was ommitted. You may want to spend a little more and get the complete 2 CD set."
5,Yummy!,"This is a delicious, soft fragrance -- so clean, pure and light. The best part is ... it's not even fattening!"
1,another disappointment,"I bought the lemon and the vanilla. They both smelled old and bad. I should return them, but hate to bother with it. Never will I buy fragrances on line again."
5,Good pricing Free shipping-what more cou you ask for?,"A great price on a genuine factory battery, not a cheap knock-off. That's the only way I buy. And free shipping to boot. It was easy to combine shipping with other poroducts I needed, such as a charger-after 15 years it finally died. A very happ customer here. You can count on my business in the future!"
1,Price for one battery makes no sence,"This single battery for a 14.4volt Black and Decker drill is listed at $44.95, which is only $4.00 less than the cost of the entire drill kit that contained:(1) Firewstorm 14.4 volt drill(2) B&D; 14.4 volt batteries(1) 14.4 battery charger(1) set of drill bits(1) case assembly to store all of the above?????????????????????????????????????????????"
4,14.4 volt slide replacement cordless drill battery,Battery is great works well and holds a charge like a new one should. I had bought a off brand battery to replace the orginal one but it did not last like the orginal Black & Decker so I went back to the orginal one and am glad I did. Thank You B&D !!!!
1,Need more run time,They should offer these units with NiMH type of batteries. Which has more than twice the run time and can be charged anytime.
5,Variety at Bed Time,We borrowed this book from the local library and fell in love with it. So happy to have found this for my husband for Christmas. He's been reading the stories nightly to our son who seems to enjoyed the lyrical rhythms of the stories. Great alternative to the usual bedtime stories.
5,A good read that deserves your attention,Christina Adams has wrote a touching story about hard work paying off for her son Jonah. It is a triumph of her family experiences and about the recovery from autism. Recovery - a once impossible dream by many doctors proven wrong by persistent parents and the desire of a child.This book is beautifully written with an insiders view of a devastating disease (not disorder.) Congratulations to Jonah for his amazing recovery and story. Congratulations to his parents for pushing hard and not giving up. Thanks Christina for your story.
5,"Kathleen Sullivan, President , The Sullivan Group","Adams' book, ""A Real Boy"", is the story of a courageous journey of a mother and her son through his diagnosis and treatment of autism. This moving journal of a devoted mother who wouldn't take no for an answer and never gave up hope, is a must read for anyone who believes they have more on their plate than they can possibly handle. ""A Real Boy"" enlightens us with an extensive background on autism and provides a roadmap for parents. However, this book isn't just for the parents of children diagnosed with autism but for anyone who has a child facing physical, mental or emotional challenges. Its message of inspiraion, love and determination will inform and encourage all that read it."
5,"Janine, fellow ""Autism Mommy""","With very little time to myself, I really had considered not reading this story. How selfish I thought, if Christina Adams could find the time to WRITE a book about her accomplishments, I surely could find the time to read it, and I did! What a wonderful story of....HOPE. Being the mother of a child with Autism, and another with ADHD, I found myself at every paragraph, pausing to say, ""I am not alone"". This touched my heart and soul. I am so grateful she decided to share her expereinces with the world. Now world...get out there and read her story!"
4,Emotionally Relatable,"In this inspiring novel, author Christina Adams shares the true story of her pursuit to provide every opportunity to help her son Jonah progress and excel the beyond the expectations of his diagnosis of autism. With her heartfelt openness of the challenges and victories of early intervention, Christina eloquently relates to the lives of many parents of children on the autism spectrum. As with many true stories and families, this account is unique and cannot be generalized to every family or circumstance; however, the underlying emotions that a parent experiences when discovering their son or daughter have been diagnosed on the spectrum remain relatable."
1,"Robert Gay, just another power hungry pastor","After reading this book it is inherently clear this man has one goal and that is personal power and self glorification. It sad to see such an egotistical pastor acknowledged.""Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses. Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear. I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality"" (1 Timothy 5:19-21, NKJV)."
4,Remeber the washing instructions,Great product but is cotton and upon some warm washes and the dryer they have shortened. Still ok underneath sweaters etc. but never alone.
5,Great Basic,"Nothing fancy here, just a great durable, washable undershirt. No itchy tags or staps. My girls love them."
5,A Look at Energy and the Feild of Science Itself,"A ""lucid and entertaining history of the concept of energy,"" as well as ""accessible to all (no math required) and (I am sure) rewarding to both nave and highly sophisticated readers."" I could not have put it better myself. I have to say the first two chapters on the workings of steam engines made me drop my expectations of the book, but after those first chapters the book became enthralling. It greatly exceeded my expectations. It delivers a forceful attack on Sir Francis Bacon, as well as addressing the line between science and pseudo-science. The book gives the narrative of how Joule got credit for thermodynamics over Mayer, all the while exploring the way credit is given in science. The book even goes on to discuss metaphysical reasoning v. empirical evidence! Truly a wondrous book that not only explains energy, but tells the interesting story of it's discovery, and explores the philosophy of science all in one."
3,Not a great design,"We purchased these as the size fit perfectly in the top of our closet for extra storage. They are a durable canvas fabric with good quality zipper and plastic top which makes it easy to see into. The flaw is that for this large size, it needed to have a support on the bottom or it just bends. We improvised and cut a piece of hard cardboard the size of the bottom for support and now we are able to lift it using the handles. Poor design but good try."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I looked at several places for a storage solution. I looked at plastic, basket, soft, hard, open, closed, etc. and this turned out to be the best solution. It is just as described and a good value for the money."
2,Perhaps Not,Not the best sounding mallet for the price. Mike Balter GM1 General Gong Mallet (Black) was a lot better sounding on my 2.5 foot GONG. This one sounded too hard - like there is not enough padding around the core - and/or the core is too hard/firm. Needs to be softer sounding.
5,"Newell Oler ""All the Day Long"" CD",Newell Oler's music is fabulous! I received the CD four days after I placed the order. Thanks for the excellent service.
2,A list of case presentation,This book is poorly organized list of case reports. The explanation of procedure is also poor. Many spaces between figures are also found. It looks like photo album.
5,Just What I Was Looking For..,Just what I was looking for. Always liked this version of Office and had it at one time till I lost the install due to carelessness on my part. This replaced one of my favorites.
5,Awesome deal!,"Great seller, great price, awesome deal. Came so fast I barely blinked before it was here. Great Amazon seller. AAA+++!"
1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed as this product. It did not kill the fire ants in my back yard and that is why I purchased it.
4,An intimate recording,"I was expecting a recording of a live performance. However, for now this would probably do. Among the currrent solo records of christine andreas, I consider this the best one. Here's to the Ladies is an nice CD, most of her renditions are good, except for Some People and Dont Rain on My Parade (you really cannot dissociate these songs with the characters and the original singers). Also, her rendition there, though enjoyable, could be quite predictable. This CD released by fynsworthalley is eclectic. A good mix of new and old songs. I particularly like mary chapin carpenter's What if we went to Italy, Show Me, Alfie, and At the Ballet. I hope she would record other jazz songs like Bluessette, or probably an acoustic version of Driftin, Dreaming. Come On, Come On would also be nice to hear with Christine Andreas' vocals. I hope for a live recording in the future."
4,A good tool for summer,"I've used software based curriculum in the past, but decided to go with the workbook this year. I'm pleased with it and my child has been able to be self-directed in her work. It's a fun way for her to stay sharp and be ready to hit the ground running in the fall."
4,Summer Learning,Thus far this has been a good skill set for our children. The worksheets keep their brains working without stressing them out like they're in school. We love the fact that there is a tool available where they can continue to think and enjoy the summer too.
4,Fun Brain Exercise For the Summer!,This is the 4th successive year that we have purchased the Summer Bridge Activities series for our son. It's a great way to keep his brain in top learning form during the summer...he actually looks forward to doing his workbook page(s) each day!We would highly recommend the Summer Bridge series!
5,The best workbook series out there!,For the first time since pre-school my daughter is enjoying her summer workbook. This series has great activites to engage your child. This morning my daughter was working on an experiment in the book instead of just doing a bunch of boring problem solving pages. I also bought the K-1 book for my other child which has experiments as well. These books are a delight and have a variety of engaging activities. I will definately purchase the Summer Bridge Activites again!
1,Ayubi is the worst writter I have ever read,"This book is awful. His writing style is arrogant and wordy, deliberately confusing, and completely inaccessible. It's as though he's getting paid by the word, and the last thing he wants is for anybody to understand what he's saying. A truly painful reading experience. Very few practical examples of the broad, Marxist claims he is making, and very irritating textual citations every second sentence that make reading it about as fun as a root canal.P.S. The one star above was a technical flaw in the program. If I had my way, rather than a star, I would have a giant black hole. Every time I sat down to read this giant cube book of drivel, I died a little inside. Truly the worst book I ever had to read."
4,Nice general book,"This is a very readable book - Bonney puts words together well. Not a ""must have"" in a beekeeper's library but a good general discussion of relevant topics. Assumes basic beekeeping knowledge. Overlaps with his beginner's book (Beekeeping: a Complete Guide); this would be aptly titled ""Your Second Year as a Beekeeper."""
5,This one is a keeper (pun intended).,In the past year I have borrowed from the library all the books I could find about beekeeping . This is one I plan to add to my personal library.
5,a must have,"Hive Management written by Richard Bonney is awesome! This is not intended to be your first bee book, however I have read two other books and started my bees just under 1 year ago, so this was perfect timing. It's an easy read and makes sense for the non-PHD bee keeper. The only negative is there's not many pictures, but I would highly recomend this book to anyone with bees!"
3,Old news,"Good basic bee keeping book and an easy read. There is a lot of good strategies in here, but in bee keeping things need to be up to date. The author is good about making sure that there are changes in treating bees that maybe available after the book was written. Bee keeper beware. If I had realized how out of date it was when it comes to disease treatments, I would not have purchased it. The author needs to update the book. Again a lot of good information, but the health of your bees IS the primary issue these days."
1,Not worth the paper it was printed on,"The book is not a useful guide. The information does not have enough depths in most areas, while less important areas (that clearly appealed to the writer) are so tediously detailed and useless that it makes you want to burn the book and use the smoke to drive the bees away from your honey :-)"
2,offers no new information,"I have several books on bee keeping, (hive management), and I find most of them offer the same basic information. This book offers nothing new."
3,seems like a factory second,"The box was prestine, but inside the box, the heatsync was dinged up and the fan screws were stripped and loose. it was easier to replace the screws than return the item. This is not what i would expect out of thermaltake. I have used tonz of thermaltake products without an issue and they have always been the highest quality. So my only conclusion is that this vendor buys factory seconds and resells them as new."
1,Too loud for my taste,"I was mistaken in giving this cpu cooler only 1 star, thinking it was really loud. It turned out to be the new video card I had added to the system. The cpu cooler is reasonably quiet and keeps the system cool. I thought it was pretty easy to install and it had some thermal grease pre-applied for convenience. On second thought, I rate this a 4 star (but I can't change the rating.)"
3,Thermaltake cooler for socket 478,This cooler is tricky to install in a crowded mini-tower case. The clips takea bit of force to get them to snap into place. But once it is installed itruns quietly.
5,Uknown but awesome.,"I saw these guys with mudvayne and taproot in L.A. I saw em, and thought they were just...awesome! I got the cd, and wasn't dissapointed...but it wasn't the band i saw onstage. On stage he was one angry dude...rivalling Hatebreed, and on the CD his anger isn't really transfered. I'm not saying it doesn't rock, it does, but if you ever get the chance: see them live. It WILL give you a different outlook on them.The last song is very different from all the rest, but i put it on repeat and i never get tired of it.Check em out, they actually use more than power chords...scary i know, but check em out."
4,Most under-rated band ever,"i have seen them live 3 times, twice with mudvayne and once with evanescence.. I liked them the first time, the second time they impressed me enough to get the cd, and the third time i got an autographed picture.. The album is great.. Hard and melodic.. Charades is my favorite song on the album, if you are just wanting to check them out listen to that song first, or This Time.. Depswa does not dissapoint"
3,Brief description.,"Sorry, but is not a review, it's just some information to help you to figure out what is this product. The three star is a so-so rating, maybe it's a good product but Neoware must help us with more information at Amazon ;-).""Capio is Neoware's fast, easy, and affordable thin client family. Capio is a cost effective high-quality solution with basic thin client functionality. Capio is available from hundreds of trained and knowledgeable resellers worldwide.Capio thin client appliances run on the entire range of embedded operating systems including Windows CE .NET, Linux, Windows NT Embedded, and Windows XP Embedded."""
1,Incredibly childish,"My teacher read this to me in school, and I was bored to death. If you want to read real fantasy, read Roald Dahl and C.S. Lewis."
3,ahh....i thought this book was okay,"I thought this book was okay i mean who would want to read a book about whangdoodles, doesn't that sound a bit stupid??This book was just okay. I mean if u read only a little bit of it, it would be boring. You hav to read the whole thing.. i was bord too at first but it got much better in the middle."
1,Extremely Predictable,"I'm sorry to say that this book was really bad. The plot was very predictable. The names of the characters were so cheesy, and everything that happened to them seemed to be made up by a seven year old. I'd say it's a good book to practice reading on, because it is an easy read, but the story stinks. Don't waste your money."
4,"Cute, but almost too cute","I liked this book and thought that it was cute, but near too cute. The plot was good and the whole thing is a happy fairy tale, and it reminds me very much of Dr. Seuss. I'm not saying that this is bad at all, I happen to like Dr. Seuss, but I don't recccomend this book to people over age 12. It just may seem too young. Don't get me wrong. I really like stories with imagination, but I believe that there is a concept of going too far. This isn't too far, but I don't think it has enough meaning to the whole thing. I rate this book Good, but not that great."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love Julie Edwards ANdrews books. I have read Mandy and The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles. THis one has many intresting characters and made up animals. It is a fun easy read book. I recomend this book for all exploring young readers. I have read both books twice and i am opening them up again for a third read. I loved this book!!!!!!!!!
4,I loved this book in the fourth grade,I read this book in the fourth grade and loved it. It is still one of my most favorite books. I am now 30 and can't wait to read it to my little girl. I think the age range of 9-12 is a little off. I think the story is more for younger readers. Its a wonderful story.
5,Favorite read-aloud book of my third grade classes !,"I have read this book aloud to my third grade classes for the last four years. It continues to be their favorite book. Students use their imaginations as they create illustrations from the text. Their drawings are so very creative and colorful. They draw the flutterbyes, the various colored trees, the Jolly Boat, the Whangdoodles' castle, the Whangdoodle, etc. all from the wonderful descriptive language of the text."
5,One of my favorite books ever!,"I first read this book as a requirement for my fifth grade book report. I enjoyed it so much that I could not put it down and actually finished it within two days!Nine years later, it is still one of my favorite books ever. I haven't read it since fifth grade, but I recently had a strong urge to find it and read it again. I've told my 25 year old boyfriend about it, and he is as excited as I am in embarking on this imaginative, enchanting ride again!"
4,An Excellent Gift For a Third Grader,"This book was purchased, after much begging on her part, for my daughter as a gift. I have not read Mandy and, in fact, have not read The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles. My daughter asked for the book and earned it through good work at school."
2,"Interesting fairy tale, but...",incredibly naive. Much too young for the recommended 9-12 year-old set. Not well-thought out start of story. The children in the story are to rely on a stranger in order to begin the adventure. Sorry.
1,Unsound and unfunny,"From the start, the author's grip on taxonomy is nebulous to non-existant. Her command of English is feeble, and her sense of humor is lacking. Most kids I know have don't want to have this read to them --its boring, predictable, and silly. Stick to the classics."
5,Inspiring creative thinking,"I am a fourth grade teacher who just read this book to her students...and WOW! The class was so involved, they never wanted me to stop reading. This book is wonderful to help develop creative thinking; and ""looking at the world with different eyes."" Many classroom discussions, writing projects, and activities were the result of reading this book orally. Wonderful book!"
4,Discover the rewards of looking past the surface!,"Call me compulsive, but I read and re-read this book more than 20 times in my childhood. This book has a special place in my 400+ book library!Ever since I read this the first time I have never seen spaces in hedges in quite the same light."
5,A classic. Buy it for yourself (and your kids),I have been searching for this book (off and on) for twenty years now. I remember it from my childhood very fondly.
5,Her books rule!,"'The Last of the Really Great Whangadoodles' by Julie Edwards was very exciting and fun. I like both of her books because of her writing style. I like the way she makes up different animals and makes up wierd names for them. It is fun to try and pronounce them. I hope she writes more books. Her books rule!written by Karin,4th grader at Bel Aire School,CA"
5,Now this is a GREAT book!,"I have to say that this book has excitement, fun, interesting creatures and things, and adventure! What more could a person want to read about?!! Take my word for it, this book is AWESOME! E-mail me if you know of any other good whangdoodle books!"
5,Great Book!! I enjoyed as much as my kids.,I have two boys ages 6 and 7 and we read it as a bedtime story. It is so descriptive that there is no problem picturing the fantastic characters and Whangdoodle land. There is also the subtle teaching of a lesson or moral that goes with each human character's experience. My boys loved it so much we have ordered copies for all the cousins. Fantastic!
5,The best of the best,This is the best book I have ever read. I intend to read it again and again in my lifetime. It's funny and exciting. It took me to a different world. I recommend this book for all ages.
5,A truly wonderful read,I read this book to my 7-8 year old son. It was wonderful. He actually gave up TV in order to read it with me. Need i say more
3,Great for kids; doesn't grow with you,"I loved this book in 5th grade. I read constantly as a child, but this book is one I remembered as special and magical. Both of my brothers read it at the same time and loved it too. About 20 years later, I stumbled across it in a used book store, immediately bought it and was sorely disappointed! I could critique it as adult, but would rather remember how I loved it as a kid."
5,The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles 30th Anniv Edition,Purchased this for my 10 year old daughter - She Loved It!!! I'm thinking of reading it myself. She recommends this as a very entertaining book.
4,This book is reaaly good!,"I really enjoyed my book. I thought it was very detailed andit seemed to fit my personality perfectly. I love to read imaginarybooks. Julie Edwards is my favorite author, and I enjoy all of her books. This specific book talked about the might ""haves"" before technology. In other words, unicorns and other creatures that only we thought were imaginary. My favorite part was at the end when they got what they were there for. I didn't like the parts when they were in danger. I think that this book is best for 13-16 year olds, because you have to really be able to use your imagination."
5,Great read!,My daughter's third grade teacher has been reading this book out loud to her students. She has them captivated! My daughter can't wait to tell me the latest of what has happened in Wangdoodle Land as soon as she gets home from school. Julie Andrews has a hit on her hands once again!
5,a pure classic!,This book is terrific! I was so lucky to have found this book in 6th grade! you can really feel like a kid again! The way that Julie Andrews put the words together is a dream creater! i couldn't imagine reading any other book!
5,oh my gosh!,"this is the best book me and my friends and family have ever read!!! it is funny, imaginitive, an captures reader's attention!"
5,The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles By:Alyssa,"I read the book The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles and I loved it! It was a great book and it brings you in and you really use the wonderful imagination that you have. There are no pictures in the book but GREAT details it has. If you like a book with a lot of excitment and detail, this is a great book for you! It is about three kids named Tom,Lindy,and Ben,plus there is a very wise proffessor that knows all about a creature called a Whangdoodle. After the proffessor shows the kids that their imaginations are wondereful and they can see the world clearly, they go to a place called Whangdoodleland and search for the Whangdoodle,while the oily prock is trying to stop them.. I can't give away the whole book,so if your interested in this report then read the book,it's WONDERFUL,GREAT,AND EXCITING!"
5,Read this book!,"When I was in fourth grade, living in CO, my teacher read this to our class. I thought it was great! It had its share of laughs, sad parts, and weirdness. Overall, this book really deserves five stars. The characters expressions were shared in a way that you understood. I strongly suggest this to readers, and not-heavy readers, 'cause this book is worth the time!"
4,Fairly predictable,"Julie Andrews writes for tweens. Her books are consistently cheerful and her characters are mannerly. The stories are usually heartwarming, with happy endings.""Whangdoodles"" features three siblings (ages 13, 10, and 8) on a quest to meet a mythical character. The only way to get there is to believe. They have to overcome fear and doubt and worry to complete their quest, and they have to encourage belief in their friend the professor, as well.The siblings are well done with believable personalities. The oldest acts like an oldest, the second acts like a middle, and the youngest acts like a youngest. They all get equal billing for heroic acts. It's particularly nice that the friendly Whiffle Bird befriends the middle child.This is a really good book for a family read-aloud,but don't be surprised if you catch your kids reading ahead!"
4,Great Book-except this...,"The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles by the marvolous author (and actress in Mary Poppins) Julie Edwards was great except the beginning dragged just a little. I suggest you try it out if you like mystery, suspense and surprises."
5,Fabulous read-aloud for children up through high school!!,"I read a chapter in this book each night for months to a cabin full of cynical, talented 17-year-old girls. And they loved it - and weren't ashamed to admit it. It's one of the few children's books I will recommend to any friend (I'm 25) and one that I love re-reading after enough time has passed that I've forgotten how beautifully worded it is. There's plenty of description AND action, and a moral thrown in as well (but not grossly). I can't believe this beautiful woman with an incredible voice and acting talent can write this well. She does!!!"
5,My Favorite Book Since 2nd Grade,"This book is so good! Since my second grade teacher, Mrs. Ward, read it to me, it has been my favorite. I have read it many times again, and it gets better every time. It is pure fantasy in an old-fashioned sort-of setting. I love it, nothing can top it. Not even Harry Potter, and that's saying a lot!"
5,One of the BEST books I've ever read.,"I was introduced to this book in the third grade when my teacher read it to us. I was facinated with the idea of traveling to places using you mind. The book takes you to many places in the lives of a young girl and her two brothers. It intrigues the imagination and that is a wonderful feeling. If you've ever wanted to just let your mind travel to places that no one has gone before, to a place of such majesty that is almost too wonderful to imagine, please, read this book.The author of this book is more commonly known as Julie Andrews (you know, Mary Poppins). This book is the best, I still like to read it. She also wrote a book called Mandy, it is an awesome book as well. I just wish she had written more.."
1,(1.5) Needs pruning...,"The Family Orchard begins with the linking of ""what my father says"" and ""what I say"", alternating perspectives as each new member of the family tree is introduced. As well, each succeeding chapter adds diagrams of the growing family.The scene is Palestine in 1837, certainly a fascinating period of historical perspective. So I was disappointed as I read further into the book and lost any sense of connectedness. I was unable to continue: the relatives became more confusing, their chapters too short to retain in memory. When a writer brings history to life, flesh and blood with human failings, it becomes knowable and informative, almost visual. This book did not offer that reality to me."
4,A Fictional Family History,"The Family Orchard follows the family history of a Jewish family. The history becomes a little difficult to follow at times, but the author has placed a family tree at the beginning of many chapters that helps clarify family members for the reader. I felt as though I knew the characters very well at the end of the book. The author does a good job of describing relationships between the characters."
3,"strong beginning, peters out",Ultimately this novel goes in too many directions. It starts off strong with rich sensuality but about half-way through it loses its strength.
4,Eve makes you feel like a member of the family,"I really liked this book. Nomi Eve makes you feel like a member of this long extended family. I did not find the book boring at all, in fact, I looked forward to times when I could sit down and read it. I found myself wondering about the characters when I was not reading it.I especially appreciated the way in which Nomi portrayed the part of the family that dealt with a child with a disability. Having a child with a disability myself, I understood the fear, the doubt, and the helplessness.This book is about relationships and family. It is a wonderful read and I would highly recommend it!"
1,Boring and poorly written!!!!!,"[...]. I finally just skimmed to get through, but it never got better. It goes to prove that anything can get published."
2,"Good words, little connection","I wanted to like this book. I certainly admire the author's research and use of language. She writes moving passages that make you feel you are there. Unfortunately this does not occur with her characterizations. Perhaps because there are so many I felt no emotional connection to any of them. The time spent with each generation is so short that you never get to know any of them. Since they were all mysteries,they seemed very much alike (the men and women both). Without any connection to the characters I found the book a great struggle to get through."
4,Mythology for younger readers,"A comprehensive explanation of the world's god-like creatures, this is an interesting and informative book - for someone older than the 9-to-12-year-old range stated.Because of the text and the type of illustrations and photos contained, I have to say this book would be more appropriate for teens, perhaps 13-15.As an adult, I enjoyed those parts of the book I browsed, but my 12-yr.-old granddaughter stated she thought it could have been made more interesting by including drawings or sketches of the various mythological creatures discussed.In spite of this, I will give the book to the younger child for whom it was originally intended simply because it is a worthwhile addition to the library of anyone who would like to have such a reference.I would also like to say I appreciate how carefully the book was packaged for mailing. It arrived in perfect condition."
5,Music that makes you think of home...,"I always enjoy playing this music. There is hardly an occasion for which is doesn't serve, and the music brings a sense of comfort and fun to my library. A great record!"
4,Transisational album for the Cure,"It seems many of the reviewers here first heard this album in college--me too. This is a more accesible record than the experimental (yet fun) ""The Top"" and less gloomy than ""Pornography"" and ""Faith"". ""Head"" makes a turning point in the band's evolution. It seems no accident that the ""Staring at the Sea"" collection came out the year after. ""Head"" is poppier without being vapid or irritating and still retains some of the band's trademark bluer, heavier emotional content. ""In Between Days"" still stands as my pick for the soundtrack of the movie of my life during those carefree undergrad years. Too bad the band didn't keep the momentum up with their next release ""Kiss Me"" x3. Too poppy, too ""up""!"
5,The Cure for musical ennui,"Whenever I'm mourning the death of our old friend, Good Music, I just slap any Cure CD onto the disc player. The Cure is the definitive ""80s and beyond"" band. Their mercurial pop melodies mingled with singer Robert Smith's Poe-meets-Rimbaud-meets-Dr. Seuss lyrical musings and plaintive wail make The Cure a truly mesmerizing presence. All of its albums are stunningly solid efforts, including the recent ""Bloodflowers,"" but 1985's ""Head on the Door"" is its most intriguingly layered offering, serving up an experimental foray into various musical styles; bits of flamenco, Japanese new wave, funk, hard rock, and even jazz sneak their way onto this magical album. The best part is, the Cure manages all the musical genre-melding without surrendering its trademark surrealistic sound."
4,Their breakthrough record,"This was the first Cure album I purchased, the summer before I entered college. I thought the album was pretty good, but when I got to campus, I was amazed by how well this record was received. Songs like ""In Between Days"" and ""Close to Me"" blared from dorm rooms. The college radio station devoted time every day to play the entire album. Listening to this album plays like a soundtrack to my first semester of school. Peppy numbers like ""Six Different Ways"" and ""Push"" collide with moody pieces like ""Sinking,"" reflecting the various emotional shifts that accompanied me during that tumultuous time. Though others might not be as personally attached to this record, it is one of those albums that has a little something for everybody."
3,On which Sir Robert combs his hair,"The Cure's 'best and most coherent statement?' Oh, smear this man across the walls / like strawberries and cream! 'The Head on the Door' is the Cure's 'Abbey Road': an album that is highly rated but somehow does not capture the true essence of the artist. The messiness, the lyrical quirkiness, of the Cure are better displayed on at least half-a-dozen of their other albums; and I personally find 'Head' to be the most barren of the Cure albums musically, when compared to their evocative best.If you're going to build up a Cure collection, there are several albums you should purchase before 'The Head on the Door'. They are (a purely personal and therefore subjective selection, of course!): 'The Top', 'Pornography', 'Faith' and 'Disintegration'."
4,almost 20 years gone by...,"Wow, hard to believe. I grew up with this album.The new album ""The Cure"" has me breaking out my Cure collection. This album is a masterpiece of pop songcraft, and still has enough of an edge to keep it intriguing all these years. The production sounds a bit dated and tinny, but that should be fixed real soon as The Cure get ready to release the re-masters later in 2004.There's not a bad song on this album. It's a great place to start if you are interested in getting into The Cure. This is the album that they splashed big with in the US. Then you could work your way backwards and forwards to fill in the gaps. I would give it 5 stars, if not for what was to come in the future..."
4,The Cure at the height of their game.....kinda,"1985's 'The Head On The Door' is often said to be The Cure's poppiest, some dare say best album. Those people were wrong. 'Inbetween Days' starts the party in full pop swing, with a fast-paced acoustic melody and bouncy keyboards. 'Close To Me' starts with a very dancy drum beat and builds up with even more danceable delight. 'Kyoto Song' with it's far-eastern influences is a dark piece to say the least and 'Sinking,' the album's closer with its Disintegration-esque keyboard sound, is just plain heart-breaking.Pop fans should listen closely; the album is chocked full of dark subject matters. Pop fans listen again; this album is filled with great hooks and lots of variety. While not as much of a mixed bag as their follow-up, 'Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me', 'The Head On The Door' is a bouncy, uneven schizophrenic affair. A very listenable and enjoyable schizophrenic affair."
3,"Good, fun experimental album","Not their best... but love it. The Blood is my favorite song on it. Has the classic Close to Me on it, although my favorite version of the song is not on the album."
2,Not worth the money,"Sure it is a Cure album but the remix was a waste of time. While they did some improving and it sounds nice, they compressed it so it is super loud. This cd is not worth the money. Buy the original release, it sounds much better."
1,Horrible book,"I like Jack Tickle pop-up books because my daughter wants me to read them over and over. She is fascinated by the pop-ups and the stories rhyme and are easy to read. These stories don't rhyme well and the stegosaurus story deals with the stick that comes out from his tail (and two ""boulders"" are shown below it). It's not anywhere near the caliber of the Very Ticklish Tiger or another I have."
5,"just by flipping through it, I wanted to buy it!","I only saw this once in the bookstore, and just by flipping through it, I knew it had to be a part of my book-collection. Just moving to the desert southwest, I have been thirsty for more about my new eco-system and home........I may not have so many dilemmas now on critters and plants.........."
1,returned,"I ordered the Large/Xtra Large helmet but it didn't even fit on my headthe foam is closed cell and very rigid, quality is what I expected for the price but I think this is a try on before you buy kind of item"
1,Too Small,"This helmet is a toy, they claim to have large and even xtra large sizes and the helmet is actually uncomfortable. Im not quite sure how protective it is but it doesnt seem durable, its a toy.If your serious about skating gt another brand."
4,A strange book that I really enjoyed,"Well, the title got it right - this is an ""unusual romance"". I can't say I've ever read another vampire book like it. When reporter Lizzie meetes ""the last cowboy"", Tucker, they don't know what they are getting into. Not long after the fatal meeting Lizzie gets turned into a vampire against her will.Despite this horrible turn of events, Tucker, being a cowboy, rides to her rescue - from therein it just gets stranger and stranger. Despite this, it is a funny and complelling read. This is a book I'm inclined to hold onto - it's worth a second read I think."
4,Definetly worth the reading.,"This book is not usually the type of book that I read. A friend gave me a copy and I started reading it. It started out slow, but after the third chapter I was absorbed. I enjoyed reading it and felt that it gave a nice twist to the vampire legend. I live in Wyoming where we have real cowboys, I was offended at first because they made the cowboy seem so unintelligent. I did get used to the idea, but I could be offended if I was a cowboy. They did portray the life that a cowboy leads very closely to how they live in our state. I also loved the ending. This was a book that kept me wondering clear to the last page. Definitly worth the reading."
3,Not that great,"I found this book very hard to read and disjointed. Tucker's dialouge seemed contrived and silly. In fact, the book was silly, but not fun which is a shame because I had high hopes that I'd come across something different in vampire fiction."
4,"1,000 years is a long time to wait for justice.","This humorous novel offers an alternative view of good and evil. Those popular cherubic angels can move over because a new gang has rolled into town in shiny new coffins. Your guardian angel may not be what you thought. The possibility of evil consuming itself is compelling especially to those of us raised with a traditional view of Eden. I always believed that snake had a better story. I recommend this book as an entertaining, yet mind opening read. A few gory scenes took me by surprise but I read on for more of that good 'ole boy Tucker. And his horse isn't half bad either."
5,LOVED IT,"I wasn't sure at first if I would like this story. But I found that I could not put it down. It is a love story, but its so much more the DeVinci Code of vampires you might even say.I like how the authors explain the reason for vampires and how darkness and light need each other to survive. This story takes its time, but its not boring. I loved all the characters, and didnt miss the sex scenes or gore. It wasnt needed and it would have taken away from the story. I want to thank the authors for this great story, great writing..."
1,Save your money,"This book provides nice reviews of life cycles of various pests and beneficial speicies, but very little practical, useful information for controlling most of the pests. Very superficial work."
5,Easy to navigate; makes learning Dreamweaver 4 easy,"I basically just jumped into Dreamweaver 4 with no prior experience aside from a basic HTML program. I needed a book that I'd be able to understand and have enough visual reference so I know exactly what I was supposed to be clicking on. Originally, I had bought ""Teach Yourself Visually: Dreamweaver 4 and Flash 5"". I was extremely dissappointed in what it offered, so I returned it for ""Complete Reference: Dreamweaver 4"". It completely made up for the hassle of the first book return. It's easy to understand and easy to navigate through. I even found something specific by looking in the Table of Contents instead of the index. It also contains just enough pictures to be helpful instead of being an annoyance. I highly recommend this book, even if you're just beginning to learn Dreamweaver 4."
5,Great resource book,"I have the Dreamweaver 4 Bible, and with this book, I can figure out the more complex stuff by reading both. I have found this book better than the DW Bible in most regards. I also bought a copy for a friend...."
5,magnificent language,"I read this book in italian, and I was absolutely impressed by the power of Bufalino's language. No matter what he writes about, you will be astonished by how effective it is. Like Marguerite Yourcenar, he manages to express very deep concepts with very few words: amazing. I am sure that also through the translation you will be able to appreciate it."
3,Santo to the rescue!,"Goofy luchador fun with husky wrestler/superhero Santo squaring off against Dr. Frankenstein's daughter, her monster and an apeman. Whew! The plot makes no sense but watch it for the laughable acting and special effects. You'll enjoy the flick if you don't take it seriously. Would have been better if it were in widescreen but I wouldn't hold my breath for that."
5,Fun outing ...,"My theater professors would probably be horrified at my enjoyment of Mexican Lucha Libre films. Actually, probably not -- these films don't pretend to be artsy high-brow stuff. They're honest escapist enjoyment. Watch them as such, and you may enjoy them as well.The female roles in this film are surprisingly strong. Santo's girlfriend du film and her sister can scream in terror with the best Hollywood actresses, but neither sit around waiting for Santo to rescue them. Dr Frieda Frankenstein is a solid villainess, with (gasp!) a reasonable plan. (OK, so she forgets it once Santo snubs her seduction attempt. Can't blame her for being ticked off, though.) The scene where Dr Frankenstein pulls Santo's mask off plays up the violation well, even with the blatant use of a body double for Santo.The fight scenes are well done, which shouldn't be surprising. The fight between Santo and Ursus in the graveyard may be a little much for younger viewers."
2,wtf???,"yea so i just receive this boxset...and for some reason i didn't get Santo and Blue demon vs frankenstein, or vengeance of the mummy...instead i get Vengeance of the crying woman, and the witches attack??....whats with that? that happen to anyone else or would it just be my luck. really ticked off about that"
1,"can't review it yet, haven't recieved it","I would review this item if they would actually send me my subscription, it's been 6 weeks and not one issue has reached me. If you order this, don't expect it anytime soon after you order it."
4,Pounding Heavy Metal,Do not buy if you want more of their first album which was a thrash classic. This one is solid pounding heavy metal with a big production. Excellent heavy metal.
2,Scraping the barrel,"This album is inferior to it's predecessor and really falls flat of reaching any sort of focus. There were at least 15-20 more bands in the 80's that I can think of off the top of my head that were doing albums like this and doing them way better. ""Watch the Children Play"" gets heralded as one of their best songs but is actually one of the worst on here. Get their self-titled album if you want to hear how much better they were just one album before this. Or you could Get ""Blessing in Disguise"" if you really want to find a lost gem, this one needs to just be forgotten."
4,Danzo's review of THE DARK,"After a stellar first album released in 1985, Metal Church returned from the road and into the studio to record one of their best albums, The Dark. The music is fairly simple and catchy. Once you get to know the album it becomes hard to put down.There are no bad songs here. Of note are energetic opener ""Ton of Bricks"", the extremely underrated ""Method To Your Madness"", which contains an uncharacteristically laid-back, commercial feel, and the ageless heavy metal classic ""Watch The Children Pray.""If you're looking for a solid straight-ahead metal album from the mid 1980s, it's hard to go wrong with The Dark."
4,Sweeeet!,"Those of us who were young in the eighties, and also metal fans, were blown away by this second Metal Church album. I remember listening to this for weeks after I bought it, amazed at the HEAVY production (I think by Mark Dodson) and great songwriting. Only complaint was the goofy lyrics to Start The Fire ( I just love to see my parents flee...) Even as a rebellious teen I thought that was a dopey line! Do a youngster a favor and turn them on to this real metal!"
2,Marc Butler,Well if your into thrash you might like this but it's not anything to write home about..the vocals sound more like a 3 year old throwing a temper tantrum!!! Really annoying save your money and invest in Celtic Frost or Running Wild!!
3,A different take on the independently wealthy detective,"I read this for our book club and found it tolerable. It features a tried and true character, the eccentric policeman who is independently wealthy and does police work to get out of the house. The plot was simple, but the author added a subplot by inserting a book within a book. If you enjoy church gossip and trivia and liturgical music, grab this book and read it."
4,Full of satire and whimsy,"First in a series of liturgical mysteries by Mark Schweizer,The Alto Wore Tweed (The Liturgical Mysteries), is a fun and unusual twist on the normal murder mystery. I am not going to go into the product description here since so many people have done a nice job of that in other reviews, but I will say it was a very enjoyable read. Unique and different, you can't approach this assuming it's a traditional mystery --- it's more a spoof than anything else but a very funny spoof.The way the author winds the two stories together (one the mystery he is writing and the other the mystery he is investigating) is ingenious and fresh. My book group read it and we all thought it a good read even though it is like nothing we have every read before. Four different women with very different reading tastes and we were all satisfied.I have already purchased all the other books in the series since I enjoyed this one so much."
4,Amusing,"Fun little romp. Not much plot, but interesting characters and purple prose. Lighthearted, great beach read. I'll try another one."
5,The Alto Wore Tweed: A Judicial Review,"The Alto Wore Tweed, Mark Swcweizer's new ""Liturgical Mystery"" is a delight to read. Set in the mountains of western North Carolina, Schweizer introduces us to Hayden Konig, an Episcopalian choirmaster and organist, who fancies himself a mystery writer. While attempting to write a mystery, Konig gets involved in an actual mystery that takes him on an amazing path with a very contemporary conclusion.Schweizer's word pictures of the scenery and people of western North Carolina are excellent and very true to life. His use of wry humor leaves the reader rolling on the floor with laughter, which is very out of the ordinary in the mystery genre, but very refreshing.You will love this book. I highly recomend it!Judge James G. Adams, Jr."
3,"Amusing, knowing frivilous","The first in this series of liturgical mysteries by this author. There are many more. They are short, and by turns whacky (the organist keeps a loaded weapon under his bench) irksome (the organist, a wealthy part-time policeman in this tiny town is writing a bad novel) puzzling and funny.The internal logic of the main plot (a murdered ne'er-do-well and resident of the town) works. Finding the murderer is complicated by the animosity between the female Episcopalian pastor and some other members of the church board, and suspicion is ladled out in generous dollops.What readers will mostly take away from this novel is a sense of having smiled a little, nodded in recognition of well-known character types, learned something about church music, and discovered the murderer, as the author planned. The novel is reasonably written and reasonably satisfying."
3,It's funny but misogynist,"It is funny, especially at the beginning, where there is an image so original and so truly hilarious it will have you in tears no matter where you are when you read it. But the plot is thin - the mystery completely solvable almost as soon as it is presented, no twists and turns at all - and more than a little misogynist, which I definitely didn't enjoy. Yes, of course, Sophia, milk and honey, Moon Goddess, Wanda - all very funny. Now let's talk about immaculate conception, turning water to wine, and the Pope's hat. For me, the author's gift for comedic storytelling didn't outweigh the fact that there wasn't much of a story to tell."
2,not impressed,"This book was recommended to me by a friend so I purchased it for .99 on my Kindle. I will finish reading it, but am skipping all the parts which are the main character's so called attempt at writing a novel. I realize this is supposed to be funny, but it is so bad that I can't read those parts. Just not my cup of tea, I guess, since my friend loves this series and was so happy to recommend them to me. As I like to say, ""This is America...to each his own."""
2,Disturbing,"This humourous book has some enjoyable inside jokes, but it also has a tone of irreverence towards Christianity that I found disturbing. The decisions of the main character show questionable ethics that is even more disturbing. Like others have said, not much of a mystery. It is a book within a book since the character is writing a mystery story. This inside story is poorly written on purpose and tedious to read. The book does have some twists and does portray small town life questionable ethics aside. Without the questionable ethics, I would have given it 3 stars."
3,Content review-spoiler alert and Mitford it isn't,"I bought this book because a review said it was like Jan Karon's ""Mitford ""Series crossed with a mystery. It seemed like that was the case at first but my problem came in when a book is going to take place in a Church mainly why would you have the female priest ( even an unliked one) do marriage counseling where she has sex with both partners individually as part of the counseling? Not that they go into details-thank goodness but come on. As you can see it isn't Mitford. While Jan Karon's books write from a place of faith, I think He writes from a place of sarcasm toward the Church.The Alto Wore Tweed (The Liturgical Mysteries)"
1,Awful,The only good thing I can say about this book is that Amazon gives refunds. The humor wears thin after the first quarter of the book. Even at 99 cents it was impossible to read one more insult to women. I know its important to not take ourselves too seriously but this guy has one joke and it just gets old.
1,the woest miter saw stand,"after viewing this saw stand i decided to purchase it, when i got the package it look firm but after assemble this product i realize i make the wrong choice. the arms are short, u cant get a steady cut because the saw stand is rocking , legs cant stay fold , this saw stand i will never recommendGrizzly H7657 Miter Saw Standany to buy this product."
3,miter saw stand,happy with product after some modification Stand is well constructed except for folding leg setup. A good idea but needs some modification because the spring pin to release legs doesn't hold in place
2,Another China made piece of junk,"Received with some plastic knurls broken. Poor workmanship, poor quality plastic, poor quality steel and aluminum. Had to do modifications to make it work on my Hitachi compound miter saw. Did not meet my form, fit and function expectations either. The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is the price and customer service. Customer service told me that most of their products were made in China. The bad part is, most of the other brands are made in China also. You get what you pay for."
3,As you would probably expect,Actually I did a lot of looking around the big box stores and found several good stands. The quality difference between the sub $100 stands and the over $200 dollar stands were significant. When I found the Grizzly and read the reviews I had hoped I had found a product of higher quality and at moderate price. Not to be. The quality was about the same as the others in the same price class. The stand itself is not as stable as I would have liked and the wheels surely don't make it mobile for anything other than moving it around the garage. As was noted on other reviews it arrived in a box with insufficient packing and a number of the plastic pieces were broken and there was a large dent in one of the legs.I was however impressed with the customer service when I e-mailed them of the problems. They were quick and helpful in sending the replacement parts for the stand.Overall the quality is what you should expect for the price and the customer service is first rate.
4,Amazing Game,"I was introduced to the Diablo series about a year ago and it is one of the best games I have played. It is older than most games out there and the graphics show it, but there are few games that are as much fun. Grab Diablo and the expansion and you will have hours of quality play time."
1,Too darn predictable!,"I couldn't get into this book to save my soul. Kristin gets called in at the last minute to be an accompanist for haughty David, and she is both repulsed and attracted by him. How many times have we heard variations of this theme? How about nearly every romance book on the planet! The writing style was too obvious, the way information was conveyed. I wish I could support this novel, because it's written by a fellow Oklahoman, but sorry, I just can't. I've never given just one star before, but there is a first for everything!"
3,A reasonable well put together text for an MBA class,"This text is a reasonably well put together text for any Finance based MBA class. It's not going to keep your interest in its current format, which could be called 'bland' at best. The content is quite good, so a reformatting of the text book should help if it happens in the future."
3,Concise and Organized,"Trading and Exchanges presents a formal analysis of the mechanics of trading. The book is organized well enough to make it easy to find what you're looking for, and the chapter summaries are well crafted. Unfortunately for Mr. Harris, Bernie Madoff and Madoff Securities, surface in a favorable light in a number of different sections."
4,High level book,"Complex book, essential guiding tool for one of my Master courses. It requires time, but it's quite easy to understand, concepts are well defined.The order should have arrived in one month, but I received it 10 days earlier, in very good conditions."
2,what does it mean ?!?,"I was waiting for a book like ORIGINAL version ! but I have received something which does not have any cover! the book has a partial damaged hard cover. I THINK, and I am not sure, this is not an original book, this is an offset printed version!"
2,Just A Flash In The Pan,"The basic sounds of the band is pretty good especially on the lead tracks Keep Your Hands To Yourself and Battleship Chains. Railroad Steel has alot of powerful energy as well. However, by the time you get the second half of this recording, the ideas are all the same and boy is it stale. The cover of the Rod Stewart song isn't bad and Golden Heart offers a slight change of pace but there isn't but originality after a while. Three chord rock at the same tone and with the same vocal stylings can really grate on one's nerves after a while.The bottom line is where are these guys today? If you were to ask ten people on the street between the ages of 20 and 40 what do you think of the Georgia Sattelites music, I would bet that about half of them would respond Who????"
1,CD skipped,Never got to listen to the cd as it would not play. Item was returned so I do not know if it contained good songs & whether or not to recommend it.
4,Better everything,"This game is definitely an upgrade from the original Aliens vs Predator PC game. I'm not talking just graphics, game engine, sound, etc, I'm also talking plot, atmosphere, action. The game has cutscenes, dialogues that can be overheard, all these help contour the scenario. There's even a few interesting twists in the plot along the way.This fps is definitely worth owning"
3,Fun game,"This is a good game for PC play and if your a fan of the AVP universe you will like the game. Its not as good as the original, it lacks the suspense and sinister feel of the first, but you will have fun playing."
1,"Didn't work for me, I don't know about everyone else","When this game arrived at my house, I put it into the computer and a screen came up that said play, options, and something else. I did not say install, and it was supposed to. I called up echnical support, went online, nadda, nothing. The worst $20 I ever spent. Avoid this problem by avoiding this product. Don't let it happen to you. I recommend you get City of Heroes instead. Now theres a fun game."
5,A great cd by a great artist!,"I originally bought this release on vinyl in the early 80's. The reissue on CD sounds flawless. Patty Weaver has a powerful voice which lends itself to a wide range of material. This album is very much a rock/pop album and is true to the genre of the era in which it was recorded. If you are looking for torch songs ala her role on Y&R this may not be your ideal cd. The production quality of this album is top notch and features an amazing line up of musicians, writers and producers. It's a shame it did not receive more airplay or promotion....it certainly deserved a follow up album, although I don't believe one was ever made."
2,Disappointed,"I wish the songs were the ones she sings on Young andRestless. I see where this was recorded in Japan in1982. She has a lovely voice, but the choice of songswere not to my liking. Maybe she'll make another recordingof love songs."
3,Useful but not up-to-date,"This book covers more or less all you need to know, and more. However it is out of date (this becomes very obvious as you start to read it), and contains both a lot of errors (in the text and tests) and covers subjects that are no longer part of the NetWare 4.1 Admin exam (messaging services and fault tolerance for example).The book could be very good, but it needs a re-write. It's useful as supplementary reading, but I would not feel confident using it as the only source of reference material."
2,"Noisy but, extra performance?","I installed this on a 1999 Chevy 454 which powers my 21' Motorhome. K&N; states that it should increase horsepower by 24 hp. I have always used K&N.; They have an excellent reputation in performance car circles. I have no reason to doubt their claim but I don't feel the extra HP. Nor did I notice any MPG improvement. I do hear the intake noise at high revs and it is very annoying. I would not do this mod if I had it to do over again.I have since removed it as the noise on long journeys was tiresome. Again, I can't tell if there was a power loss upon removal and I can't tell if there was any mileage gain when installed and consequent loss when removed. I've kept mileage records but there have been too many variables to know cause and effect."
5,100 Birds and How They Got Their Names,"I purchased this book because I had been given and read 100 Flowers and How They Got Their Names by the same author, Diana Wells. This book was as enjoyable as the one on flowers. The pen and ink illustrations and the descriptions are accurate and, as the book jacket states, the author ""has a remarkable ability to dig up the curious and the captivating"". A fun read."
2,Nothing extraordinary,"Anyone could have compiled this information, even a high schooler doing a report for English class. Aside from this obvious fact, the writing is simply boring and dry.The history provided is sketchy, and does not necessarily tell the story of how certain birds were named, simply the etymology of birds' names."
5,A wonderful thing to have in your kitchen!,"This 3.5 qt French Oven is such a great pot for things such as soups, stews, and larger batches of sauce. It heats evenly and you can usually get away with a lower heat level than called for in a recipe because the heat distribution is really effective. I've already made a number of tasty dishes in this pan, and I can't imagine what I did before I owned this. 3.5 quarts doesn't sound like a lot, but it's plenty of room for a couple or small family. I highly recommend this for cooks of all levels!"
5,"Thorough, helpful, and reader-friendly","Dr. Kaufman's book is an educational and invaluable discussion of the facts of melanoma, both its prevention and its treatment. His work is relevant to everyone, since melanoma's number of victims is rising faster than that of any other cancer. His advice on how to prevent the disease, backed up by informative graphs and statistics, is practical and useful. He competently reviews many possible treatment options, letting the reader know what is available to her and the costs and benefits of each option. He even ventures into the realm of melanoma research, describing and commenting on progress being made in its treatment. No melanoma patient should be without this book."
3,Theoretically a Good Book,"I read this book in a teacher's book study. Although it certainly addressed all of the current philosophies of language learning, inclusion,contextualizing, giving detailed feedback, etc., the main thing I remember from that book study is how glad I was not to be still in graduate school having to read things like this regularly. It was heavy on theory and short on practical, usable suggestions for the actual teacher having to deal with discipline issues, keeping the kids entertained and motivated, and coping with paperwork while instructing. The prose was dense and unapproachable. I can see that a lot of effort was put into the book, but I hope any future editions will take the practicing teacher into account. It takes a lot of time and effort to put together a stimulating language class. Reading this book took more time than it was worth in terms of practical information."
4,K.O.,I think this book is awsome! In this book a boy accidently goes to another planet.He meats a girl who commands him to do all herdirty work.In the end they all become friends.
1,Not good review,"Although the cover is in English, the movie is not. English subtitles are there. Fine print should be made larger when the movie is not in English. Seems to me that all movies sold in American should be considered in English, unless specified in LARGE print. Not happy."
2,great comedy and great music too,"I love this movie for the story and the characters but I have to day a great big THANK YOU! to the people who chose the music for introducing me to the wonderful world of Gilbert and Sullivan. When I first saw this movie, I had to know more about the music played in the final scenes. So I sat through the credits and learned it was from ""The Mikado"" by Gilbert and Sullivan. I went to my local library and found not only the Mikado but also - Ruddigore, the Pirates of Penzance, HMS Pinafore and my all time favorite ""The Yoeman of the Guard"". Shortly thereafter PBS broadcast a series of all their plays which are now available on DVD. I will be forever grateful to the makers of ""Foul Play"" for a really fun movie and a widened musical horizon."
4,"Thought I was getting a DVD, but it was VHS. Bummer!",Excellent movie! I should have seen if it was DVD before I ordered. Received a VHS tape. ANYWHO! I still enjoyed the movie. Funny!
5,"Lookout for the Elf, ""....I mean ""Beware the Midgets.""... I mean DWARF.","I never get tired of this film, Chevy Chase should have done more films than this instaed of all of those Vacation Sequels. I still laugh at the scenes with Billy Barty (TRUE TRUE), and the car scene (KOJAK....BANG BANG). definitly worth it."
4,Just plain Good Entertainment,"This is one of my favorite ""comfort"" movies. You don't have to think a lot, and there's not much deeper meaning. But as homage to Hitchcock, Foul Play is just plain good entertainment. THIS NEEDS TO BE ON DVD IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT!There. Now I feel better. Watch this one with your sweetie."
5,One of the funniest comedies of all time.,"It's a romantic comedy with a little action adventure. Amazing on screen chemistry between Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase. This is probably one of the few films when Chase comes across as the sexy leading man, not the goofy father of Vacation. The story has lots of twists and turns and some very funny characters, like Dudley Moore, the symphony conductor with a dirty mind always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Burgess Merdith, the landlord with a pet snake, and a quick but memorable appearance by an Asian couple getting their first taste of America in a police chase through the streets of San Francisco. Simply hilarious."
5,Great movie.,"This movie is very funny, clean humor and suspenseful. I have yet to see a movie with a balance of comedy, suspense and drama. Plus it has great actors like Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn, Dudley Moore, and the loveable, Burgess Meredith. I would say Chevy Chase's and Goldie Hawn's best movie, although, very few people know about this movie. Excellent!!!"
5,Finally!,"short and sweet, It's about time! I have been waiting for this for years! Goldie at her best...well, I am a sucker for The First Wives Club, and Seems Like Old Times also. 70's movie fans will be thrilled, along with any screwball comedy who done-it's of the past. A++"
4,Beauy,"picture excellent,very satisfied.The only hiccup was it took so long to get here.Why does it take so long to come from u to us?"
5,One Of My Favorite Comedy Films,"I saw this when it was released to theaters and still love it, although the 70s atmosphere dates the film. Goldie Hawn is appealing as the divorced librarian whose best friend urges her to go out and have a little fun; when she picks up a hitchhiker she's suddenly is pursued by strange men with designs on her life. Chevy Chase is quite funny as the perpetually-in-trouble police lieutenant who helps her. There is a hilarious (but a tad overlong) scene with Dudley Moore as a nebbish with a wild apartment, and a marvelous performance from Burgess Meredith as Goldie's kindly landlord (who has other talents and who owns a python named Esme). Marilyn Sokol is especially funny as Goldie's paranoid co-worker who is convinced that her friend is ""a light bulb waiting to be screwed."" Watch out for: Billy Barty as a little person, a John Denver-like guy with a camper, and a couple of Japanese tourists."
5,Just fun,"A movie to watch for fun. Nothing earth shattering, but very enjoyable. One of my all time favorite movies"
5,Foul Play,"This is my favorite Goldie Hawn movie. It makes me laugh. It came in good shape, and it arrived in a timely fashion."
5,Forgotten Goldie/Chevy/Dudley Classic,"Dashing Chevy, kookie Goldie and Dudleys performance in his 'pad'. Add a dash of intrigue (which by todays standards will appear dull) and you have a mixture of laughs and mayhem. Its a great early vehicle for all actors and so sad that its been missing from the shelves for such a long time. Maybe dull by todays standards, but well worth the laughs that it still brings. Dudley steals scenes with his performance and I forgot how good Chevy Chase is/was and Goldie as usual with super humour timing. Scenes not to be missed, Dudleys disco pad!!! Keep an ear out for some of the lines. I think its time they brought this forgotten classic back."
4,"Dwarves! Albinos! Pope-Abusers! Oh, My!","As good for what it says about the mores of 1970's San Francisco (probably the most scenic setting for a movie there can be) as for its neat little plot about a charmingly sweet librarian's accidental involvement in efforts to stop the assassination of the visiting Pope by a Bond-villain-esque gang of thugs. The stylish, perky Foul Play, which tips its hat to both Hitchcock and film noir, is also really funny! Goldie Hawn is lovely here, and as a detective Chevy Chase, once an A-list leading man, actually seems hip. Were the '70's truly like this? I like this movie a lot."
4,Foul Play,"Funny, funny, funny, with a good little mystery going at the same time. Chevy and Goldie teamed up are hard to beat."
2,Slow,"Did not receive the first pair of sunglasses. Customer service was slow to respond to emails and resend sunglasses. Finally, received sunglasses via USPS though was not told how or when they would arrive. Took a month to finally get order."
1,What happened to the Trance Mix USA 2 feel??,"I've anticipated volume 4 for a while, largely in part to volume 3's horrible disapointing sound (see my review on that!). But when I saw it at Best Buy some time ago, I was... how should I put it...Scared!! What is going on? Somebody needs to write these people or something. If a cd is going to be that bad, don't drag the letters USA into it!! USA clubs play great trance, and it ain't this stuff!! Thanks to my own opinion and the opinion of other reviewers I have no intentions of getting this cd. I'll pray for volume 5's sake!"
1,not what i was expecting!,price too high chain very week % thin I had to buy another chain!i needed to keep for a gift.
3,Money for old rope,"Silvertone are really starting to annoy me, in the last 12 months The Stone Roses have realesed 2 albums and a single, AND THEY BROKE UP 6 YEARS AGO! The album is basically DJs attempting to ruin 10 songs that were perfect as they were. The only reason I havn't given the album a lower rating is because no matter what they try do to the songs, they will always be great songs."
3,Gilding the lily,"Stone Roses completists are going to want this CD anyway (I did), but, really, why remix classic tracks? None of these songs are helped at all by the tinkering, and the originals were already suitable for the dance floor. Call it product, listen to it once, and file it away."
3,"finish nice, fit questionable","The product has a terrific finish but the fit was less than to be desired. What I mean by that was that I could not get the doors to align. On the right side, the door gap is too tight thus not allowing you to adjust the door alignment. My right side door is a 1/4"" lower and slightly tilted."
2,"Book of Proverbs,","The print is too small, size of book was not described, therefore I ordered unknowing what to expect."
3,"Pretty good history, but biased conclusions","I enjoyed reading this book, and it's history help me a lot to understand the evolution of temple ordinances. I'm LDS and don't understand why someone said LDS would feel embarassed by the book. If it wasn't for the uncalled opinion on how it should evolve (like sugesting a short version of the endowment) I would have given it an extra star. By uncalled opinion I mean that the temple ordinances evolution is not a matter of public opinion (the LDS church is not a democracy, but a theocracy) but rather a matter of either revelation or leadership decision (decision of those in authority to make such changes."
2,Interesting but filled with assumptions.,"Interesting how they reached their conclusions, but much of it is biased by personal opinion and judgement."
3,Time for some light to be shed on this....,"That's all I can say, I haven't read (or even seen) this book; I give it a default 3 stars ONLY b/c necessary to post. I've known many, many ppl who have left Mormonism because they were turned off FRIGHTENED by attending the temple; What a Shame (tongue-in-cheek)...'Learning' (going Blindly to Temple, anything) without Understanding? Foolishness!"
5,An excellent guide to solving serious money problems,"If you have serious financial difficulties, this book will get you on the path to fiscal health. You'll learn how to respond to wage attachments, lawsuits, the repossession of your car, foreclosure proceedings, property liens, and IRS threats. Includes practical tactics for getting creditors off your back."
3,"An ""A"" for effort.","Beautiful packaging, Nelson Riddle, and classic pop standards! How could anyone pass this up? The only thing that left something to be desired was Linda's attempt at singing these songs. The voice sounds unsure and out of place. Other reviewers are displeased with those who compare Linda to other artist that have made these songs so famous, (Frank, Ella, ect.). But how can you not compare her? If someone were to record ""Over the Rainbow"" they would for sure be compared to Miss Judy Garland. The fact that Linda falls short is no surprise. Artists of her generation, Carly Simon, Pia Zadora, and most recently Rod Stewart have attempted similar material and have all missed the magic mark. And to show I am not biased of the ""original"" crooners, just listen to Olivia Newton-John's version of ""The way you look tonight"" from her ""Warm and Tender"" cd and you will see what a great singer can do with a great song."
3,Not as good as I expected,"It has some pretty good pictures but I was expecting more. Also, I think it has a somewhat confusing layout and I find myself have to flip from front to back to find answers to 1 plant. It's an interesting read but I haven't really used it to help identify plant diseases which is what I bought it for."
4,Watch Envy,"What a beautiful watch! I have been told on more than one occasion that this watch gives ""Watch Envy"" to people who see it.This is a self-winding watch and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5. It constantly needs movement and is difficult to keep wound. It would have been better as a stem-wind movement. This is also not a 1948 vintage watch, it is quite modern and is from last year's or the year before's collection of Invictas.There is a back crystal as well and just about everything is visible in the watch. The leather band is quite comfortable and has quick release latches if you want to remove or replace it.Thumbs up for this watch!"
5,Awesome resonator,I purchased this resonator because I was running a straight pipe on 2010 Accord v6 6 speed with the 3rd cat deleted and was experiencing rediculous amounts of drone in the cabin and also some horrible sounding rasp from my exhaust note. I threw this resonator on and rasp is completely gone and drone is almost non existent. This resonator made a night and day difference for how much it suppressed drone. Couldn't be more pleased with my exhaust note right now. Here's a link to how my exhaust sounds like with the vibrant ultra quiet resonator mounted....[...]
2,Ditch the kids!,"I bought this after reading the somewhat negative reviews on Amazon.co.uk. They weren't wrong.I'm not sure if it's just the way Matthew has written about them, but his 2 children seem to be the nastiest, most spoilt, horrible and ungrateful children it's ever been my displeasure to come across.Using the now all too familiar stance of self deprecation made fashionable by Bill Bryson, matthew does a fairly simple east-west USA drive by RV."
4,Addictive,"While working on a popular family cruise ship as a Youth Counsler we used this CD religiously. As odd as it is the kids LOVE it, especially Agadoo, Superman, and the Music Man, when you put the motions to these songs the kids can't stop dancing! As an adult, yeah they get old, but 3 years after finishing my sailing days my friends and I STILL talk about this album and will do the Agadoo, and I'm buying the CD for MY son."
4,"This is a Great ""Record""","The first reviewer isn't as abreast to this past music phenom as this white person from the Chicago area at the time (80's) is - these are the backbone of Chicago house as far as I know - a lot of these (long) tracks were the inspirations for the DJ's who ""used"" these historically brilliant grooves (shorter for more effective use of their air time) to build their own sounds upon, thus creating multi-layered textures that the other DJ's of WBMX in Chicago (mostly amatuers I think) could build upon still some more. I actually quite enjoyed remembering the various DJ's who built upon these grooves to create even better grooves (albeit edited somewhat), but alas, I'm white and can't dance a lick in ""public!"""
2,songs of yesteryear,"a great reference of some fine sounds, although the genious of this music was in the mix making the middles and ends of tracks quite booring and predictable. does anyone know of any similar music that has been mixed from this period?"
3,Very good.,I found this book very entertaining. It was easy to find myself rooting for the heroine as she battles her past and her fears to find a better future. This is not my usual choice of reading material but I'm glad I chose this book.
2,Took too long,This took to long to receive in the mail. Once I got them they didn't taste very well either. Will not be buying this again.
1,Who wants an emasculated Shaft?,"Stay away from this CD. The track ""Do Your Thing"" has been edited down to less than a third of its original length. Stick with the regular CD edition until some other label with brains releases a proper remaster."
3,Netter's Embryology,"This is a new and welcome addition to the Netter family of publications. IMHO, the real utility of Netter publications lies in the rendition of the plates. As an embryological atlas, this volume leaves somethings to be desired. Aside from this caveat, the images are a wonderful addition to the littany of ""standard"" figures that are ususally the same figure repeated with minor variations.The use of color is of particular value in understanding the development of structures where boundaries between transient elements is indistinct. These make a nice adjunct to the more conventional texts.This is a teaching book that will be of greatest use to those who have already grasped the basic elements of human embryology. They illustrate conceptually complex topics and are thus of real utility. I don't see this as a primary text, since it contains a great deal of anatomical, pathological and teratological images as well."
3,pretty but way tooooo big for me,I should have read the other reviews more closely. It really is a nice watch but for some reason it seems to be made for a man's wrist.
3,Consistent But Not Very Engaging,"One to One is a very consistent album. Howard Jones has always been a good songwriter, but I've always found that a lot of his material is not very engaging. Good music, but not always very listenable. Most of the songs on here try hard, but still don't leave much of an impression on me. I like the earlier version of ""No One is to Blame"" better than the version on here. I really like the intro to ""Balance of Love,"" but the rest of the song isn't that great. An okay album. Human's Lib is his best album."
2,What Happened?,"After ""Human's Lib"" and ""Dream Into Action:, I was all fired up to hear what HoJo had in store for us the next go around. What I got, was what I think, is his most disappointing album. ""You Know I Love You"" somewhat sounds like HoJo was trying to re-visit ""Things Can Only Get Better"" but it didn't work. ""No One Is To Blame"" was originaly on ""Dream Into Action"". This new version was produced by Phil Collins. The two songs that I really do like on this album are ""Will You Still Be There?"" and ""Give Me Strength"". I think HoJo spent a lot of time arranging this album, and trying new ideas and concepts. The songs seem well produced but lack the warmth and infectiousness of his previous works. Which is ironic since he began to use live musicians more on this album than on his previous two."
3,"Good, but not very heartfelt.","This album in my opinion is when things started going downhill a bit for Howard. His songs were falling off the charts, and he was trying to please a wider audience.He does an alright jobs, but the songs just don't sound like he put as much feeling into them as he did in Human and Dream.Alright for HOJO fans, but not really worth it for simple 80s pop fans."
4,Deserved to be more popular,"I think this album deserved to be more popular than it was. The change in producers to Arif Mardin resulted in Howard's funkiest album to date (as of 2001). From this album on, HoJo went into a steady decline (notwithstanding the difficult to find release on the DTox label called ""Working In The Backroom"").A note as to this cd: the original vinyl did not contain ""No One Is To Blame"". The cd contains this track as a ""bonus track"" in its hit version, produced by Phil Collins. The fade out of this track is marred by a very noisy digital fader, however, so I wouldn't recommend getting this disc for that song. The single remix of NOITB sounds better on the HoJo ""best of"" cd."
2,Barely useful,"The book has alot of information, but very fewcolor pictures. It mostly uses drawings which are not much help. Some of the plants they discuss have neither. It is useful but definitly not a complete guide."
3,Fair,"This is a very informative book. It lists, what plants are edible, which ones are useful, and which ones are extremely toxic. The place that this book falls short is that there are few pictures. I will have to go buy a real field guide to go along with the book. Overall I am happy with the huge amount of information in the book. It would just be soo much better to have pictures with it."
2,If your looking for a field guide with photos this isn't it.,"I just bought this for my kindle phone in hopes that I could reference photos to what I am seeing on the roads. If that is what you are hoping for don't bother. I haven't found any photos in it yet, but I'm still looking. So far there are just a few hand drawn sketches that it's hard to tell from. I did buy a handy app from the app store that cost me $9. I wish I would have just done that to begin with. It isn't as complete as this and doesn't have all the handy knowledge, but at least you can tell what you're looking at."
5,Great!,"This book is amazing! It covers an incredible number of plants, all of which found in and near Texas, and features good descriptions for most. It is a little disconcerting that both toxic and edible plants are grouped together, but each species is labeled. I like the fact that it covers both native and non-native species. I would recomend this book to any Texan."
2,A Disappointment,"I was so looking forward to receiving this book! The title led me to believe it was exactly what I was needing. Alas, not so! This book is crammed with somewhat random information and might be very appealing to those looking for help with natural fibers and dyes, but I wanted details on edible and medicinal wild plants of Texas and this book is a very poor reference guide for that purpose. An appalling lack of photographs and only average black and white line drawings make it almost useless as an aid in field identification. It is not well organized from a practical standpoint and only if you already know the name of the plant (why would I need such a book if I already knew?) is it easy to find. Directions for harvest and use are sketchy, at best. Sadly I must say I do not recommend it."
3,Psycho Rapist,"""H6"" is about a man who is released from prison and begins raping and killing women inside a brothel that he runs. Just so you know there are subtitles on this film due to the foreign nature. Yes, this guy is a psychopath who rapes and kills several women, but the plot kind of falls apart after that. This film wasn't what I had expected it to be. It centers all attention on him instead of his victims, which is the opposite of the movie Hostel. There is plenty of gore, but each scene tends to repeat itself with yet another victim. This film isn't bad but it could have been much better."
2,Westside Wins,"I was expecting a lot more out of this than I got. The entire Northtown side of the cd is lousy, with maybe one or 2 good songs. The Westside tracks arent much better but they do have La Clicka, Redrum Inc., and of course Doomsday. I would say dont buy this unless you collect cd's (like I do), because if you dont you will just end up getting rid of it. Instead of this buy anyone of the Doomsday albums expecially Filthy, it's classick."
2,Was not impressed,"I was disappointed in this product especially considering how exceptional the Salmon Oil they make is.This did not pass the 11 rescue dog test! They just turned up their noses. So did the other dogs here. Very tiny tidbits, as well.Buy an extra bottle of the Grizzly Salmon oil instead."
1,Sorry...not the Original,"Why do people have to mess with perfection? These remixes of the original Carpenters selections sound like a bad attempt to recreate the past. Karen's awesome voice isn't going to change, but the twiddling and tinny, often childish remixes completely ruin the original sound. Barf."
3,Eh,"I bought this excited about the Carpenters songs that I already knew and loved (""Superstar"", ""Rainy Days and Mondays"", those kinds) and then realized that the songs I already knew and loved were the only songs on the DOUBLE DISK collection that I liked. Ouch, I never realized how hokey the Carpenters are. Fortunately, the radness of the songs that are catchy and great are more than enough to uphold the legacy that Karen Carpenter all too soon left behind. A good collection to buy second hand from your local record store."
3,"very good, BUT!","this is a 2 disk set. one disk has most of the hits i care about. the second disk has a lot of good music on it, but it is stuff i never heard, and nothing i would have gone out of my way to buy."
3,Disc 3 falls short,This would have been a great set had they filled out Disc 3. There are enough excellent Carpenter album tracks to have chosen from.It'd be nice if there was a Carpenters complete box with all of their albums.
5,Cook'n Just Right!,This is a beautiful French Oven for use on stove top and in the oven. Maintains heat temperatures evenly throughout the dish. Presents well on the dinner table -- use a coaster as this pot will stay very hot. Be prepare to do some weight lifting because this is the real thing -- a heavy duty classic cooking tool. Love it! :)
3,Overwhelming -,"This book had some interesting stories, lots of interesting ideas, but I came away more confused then reassured. I was definitely more comfortable about what might lay ahead after I watched the Pardeys Storm Tactics DVD. But maybe it is good to have lots of ideas stored in the back of my head for that day when we have to face real storms at sea."
1,Lies perpuated against Islam,"This is another book by a Jewish person (who is anti-Islam and anti-Muslim) and a Christian Fundamentalist who are trying to spread lies about Islam. Islam is spreading throughout North America and Canada despite the hate propaganda being perpuated by such people. Basically, the book is not in good taste in my opinion and very biased to suit the jewish/christian hatred of Islam."
2,Very biased and misleading.,"This book is extremely biased and inaccurate in its viewpoint on Islam. It has a very twisted and manipulated viewpoint of Islam and a more accurate title for this book should be "" A Defense of Christianity against Islam"" - I don't mean this as a joke. The basic structure of this book is to state a ""fact"" in an extremely biased and twisted manner, then proceed with about 10 pages defending Christianity or stating why Islam is wrong. The book actually ends with a chapter letting Muslims know that if they wish to be free of their faith to say a prayer and to accept Jesus into their lives. This prayer is then followed by a page directing them to a site where you can receive Christian literature to complete the salvation. The only good I found in this book is in learning what a very dedicated person has to say in defense of their beliefs."
1,Very biased and non-scholarly view of Islam,I am a student of Religious Studies at Indiana Univ. studing Islam in America. Mr Ankerberg uses mostly outdated and biased Orientalist sourses for his work and presents a view of the Islamic tradition that ignores the perception of Muslims toward their own faith. It is definitly NOT the facts on Islam. Avoid it.
4,classic southside,"This album was originally called the Jukes and several of the tracks were different, I remember becuase I purchased the LP back in the summer of 1982. However they have taken a lot of good South Side Johnny tunes putting them all on one cd. i originally purchased this item because ""vertigo"" was always one of my favorite songs preformed by this band. However, they have included alot of other great Southside tunes like ""SO Anxious"". Although this was another jersey Shore group that did not achieve the kind of fame that Springstien did, Southside johnny is an extremely talented musician who never really received the notoriety he deserved. This is a moderately priced cd that is worth the money and certainly, if you experienced the excitement of the jersey shore as a high school or college youth, worth the listen as it brings back some fond memories. Highly recommended"
2,Overrated,"I read this book based on the reviews I found on the net. Unfortunately, I could not connect either emotionally or intellectually with her work. I felt her poems were overwrought and ""clunky."" Sorry to disagree with most of the above reviews. I favor poets along the lines of Li-Young Lee, Sherman Alexie, Gary Sato, and Lucille Clifton. Emotionally packed, complex, and layered; these are the qualities that I want in poems."
5,Simply the best game ever!,"This is still the best game that has ever been made. I hav Brood war and Warcraft 3, but Brood War is a far superior game. People often say... ""but Warcraft 3 has much better graphics."" People have forgotten that games are about gameplay, not graphics.WARNING: This game is addictive. I bought Starcraft right when it came out, and still play this game. The one problem is I will soon need to buy another copy because the label is starting to get a little scrached off and my computer is having a little trouble reading it."
5,Wonderful Puchase,Seller was prompt and very responsible. Item came quick and in almost new condition. Game works wonders to my emotional stability. Thanks for everything.
5,Starcraft -- Brood War,This is a great game. I remember playing it in middle/high school. I think I have been playing too much. Haven't completed all the levels yet but I'm enjoying it already. The price is a deal.
2,Not overly impressed,"I am not particularly impressed with this cd, and honestly I wish I hadn't purchased it. I would recommend simply downloading belly dancing music to your mp3 player if you need it."
2,PRICE CAN BE BEAT,BOUGHT THIS CARHART AFTER BUYING ONE EXACTLY LIKE IT FROM C.E. SCHMIDT WORKWEAR. SCHMIDT'S WAS ONLY $29.99 AND WAS HEAVIER THAN THE CARHART..ADDING MORE WARMTH. MUCH BETTER BARGAIN THAN CARHART.
5,Practical knowledge of turbo installations for non-engineers,"Excellent book designed to lead both the novice and the experienced home mechanic around the pitfalls of turbo system design and installation. Many practical tips without delving too deeply into the arcane world of thermodynamics. The author has designed, built, and installed successful turbocharger systems for over 26 years and is very knowledgeable of the subject area. Also read MacInnes' book ""Turbochargers"" for additional knowledge; although dated, it contains good info if you are interested in gas laws and higher technical content. If you want practical knowledge of turbo systems that you can actually use, read ""Maximum Boost"". BTW, Corky Bell's turbo kits have never needed water injection because they are engineered correctly from the beginning!"
4,"great book, very informative","I have read alot of technical literature, and this book covers all the bases pretty well for someone with some mechanical background, but no solid understanding of turbo system operation. It is a fun informative read!"
4,Max Boost = Max info,"Corky Bell is able to relay some very technical aspects of understanding turbo charged engines, in an easy to read and understand format. I highly recommend this to any one considering a turbo for their car, so you don't get lead astray with sales hype."
5,Very good book!,"Money well spent. Corky explains all aspects of turbocharging. Good high level theoretical treatment, and better yet, lots of practical information backed up by real life examples that test different turbo designs in different automobile types."
4,Maxium boost,"Focuses mainly on do's and don't of kit installation.Has good info on basic turbo setup and intercooler selection. Would have been nice if the book contained more info on custom manufacturing of intercoolers and exhaust manifolds (forming end tanks and size to exhaust velocity vs tube type exhaust and construction). As well as selecting the correct BOV.Overall, great information for beginning turbo quester and a recommended read."
5,Best book on turbocharging I have read.,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in turbocharging, both factory turbo cars and aftermarket kits on non turbo cars. It covers pretty much every aspect of turbocharging from manifold design, to turbo selection to fueling. I feel having read this book has better equipped me to work with turbochargers."
4,good book on turbocharging,I believe this book covered turbocharging and what is needed in order to make your car operational with a turbo well. It is very good book if you go in with minimum knowledge of turbos. It tells you good information on setting up your car with a turbo and choosing the right one. But I do recommend to get the most out of it you need some good understanding of cars and engines before you read it. I am only giving it four stars because it tells a lot about good part characteristics but the putting it all together chapter could be much more in depth and do more cars plus the aerocharger is referenced more than once and I can't find where to buy one anywhere on the internet.
4,"Excellent book, needs a summary.","All of the information in this book is up to date and direct to the point in each chapter. The information and calculations needed to assemble and install a system are in this book. It would be nice to have a summary of the steps to figure out a turbo system, but one can do their own outline and summary with a little time and attention. All in all, a good book with great information that even a beginner can understand with a little study."
4,great book,"This book is very well written. It handles a lot of the basic turbo knowledge that most enthusiast's need to know. What was dissapointing was that there is no real turbo sizing theory, fan blade effientcy equations or a lot of detail in a few other areas. None the less, the book is only about turbo systems and is the easiest to read. This is a great book to read. You may also want to get ""Turbochargers"" from Hugh MacInnes, it's also a must have, but is out of date and is not very useful on the modern EFI machines. I do like ""Force Induction"" by A. Graham Bell. A book that is much more knowlegable on the subject of performance turbos. It's always a good idea to get opinions of other great writers."
4,Bell gives good information on all aspects of turbo systems.,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It gave me a good understanding of turbo systems, perhaps it is even enough to build my own setup. Bell's book priases the performance of the Bell Aerodyne VATN turbocharger, as well it should - notice the name ""Bell?"" Even though this bias is there, the book does provide a thorough, easy to read manual for designing, installing and testing turbo systems. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn about turbochargers and their applications. Another good, perhaps more thorough but slightly dated book is ""Turbochargers"" by Hugh Mcinnes."
2,A reasonable introduction to turbocharging,"This book provides a good general overview of turbocharger systems in a very easy to read format, however do not take this book to be the bible of turbocharging it is distinctly lacking in theoretical content. And does contain some outrageous statements written in a childish manner. It is suited to the DIY enthusiast rather than an engineer."
2,A little knowledge . . .,"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, expensive too. This book is safe for those who already know a lot about Turbocharging, but they won't need this book. For the beginner, this book isn't bad to get familiar with the subject, but I wouldn't try using it as a source of information or a ""how to"" book, too much mis-information. Don't get this book unless you also get the book by Hugh McInnes. Mr. Bell is either guessing about things he hasn't tried, or hasn't been able to implement things that work for others because of his lack of understanding or poor execution. Don't quit your day job Corky!"
2,"Sadly, this book is becoming dated I think","I realize that Corky Bell is one of the most recognized authorities on turbocharging, but I think that this book is fairly outdated by now and does not give adequate coverage of today's modern, computer controlled vehicles. The books most recent publication is listed as 1997. Think of how much cars have changed over the last decade. It looks like over time he has attempted to keep it timely, but even these are outdated now and are incorporated merely as footnotes to each chapter. I also hate to admit such a non-scientific, emotional response, but looking at a bunch of photos of cars and engines from decades ago just doesn't motivate me to go out and modify my car.The book does provide a good overview of turbocharging and how it works. I do think it will serve as a good primer for people. However, I am looking forward to buying some of the more recent publications out there."
3,Everybody has their own view.,I found the book interesting. Corky seems kind of against draw thru turbos though...too bad because thats what I am doing.
5,Wow,"Corky says it is not an engineering treatise, but it is very indepth. You will be able to design and calculate turbo systems from this book. Lots of good info..."
5,Good info on turbochargers for the beginner and the experienced,Mr. Bell continues to produce excellent information on auto engine modifications in this book. The only suggestion I would make is an update to the book to include sections on the latest technology coming out of the manufactures today like Direct Injection and ECU's with advanced mico processor technology.Mr. Bell explains the turbocharger and systems associated with turbochargers in a very detailed and easy to understand format and I would highly recommend this book to both the DIY novice and the experienced gear head but not a person who is looking to advance their engineering knowledge.
1,"promises much,delivers very little",This book is full of contradictions and incorrect information.I cannot recommend this book at all.
3,Captain Rizz - 'Manifesto' (Griffin),"Obviously, a lot of us likely know Captain Rizz from his association with Hawkwind - believe he's been guest vocalist with Dave Brock and company on numerous occasions, as I've conveniently forgotten about. 'Manifesto' employs some Hendrix-influenced wah-wah guitar playing you'll hear time again through out it's seven tracks. CD has two different versions of ""Voodoo Rizz"" and ""Rizz's Song"" (one with vocals, the other instrumental) which are decent. ""City Of Angels"" sort of remind me of early '90's Hawkwind and ""St. Cecilla"" is so-so. I can't stand most rap, and I like and appreciate some reggae - however I am no fan of when artists try to fuse rap and / or reggae with more commercial genres of music in an order to 'fit in'. I felt that 'Manifesto' borders on just that. Overall, not necessarily a bad effort, but I would say this CD is much aimed toward Hawkwind completists."
2,Nothing New,No original ideas ... the same formulas ... competent but ultimately uninteresting musicianship. Welcome to Chapter Five of the Metallium saga ... and I haven't even mentioned the dumb lyrics yet.
3,"Search the ""used"" pile for the longer version of this CD.","The CD being sold here is an edited version of a CD that Mercury released some years ago called ""45's on CD"" Vol. 3. (It bears no resemblance at all to the disc in the current series called number three.) With the exception of ""Love is Blue,"" all of the songs here are on that longer CD. It's worth seeking out if you're missing these songs, which don't appear on this shorter CD:""Reach Out in the Darkness"" by Friend and Lover;""Summertime Blues"" by Blue Cheer;""Warm San Franciscan Nights"" by the Animals;""Fire"" by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and""I Will Always Think About You"" by New Colony Six.The ""old"" cover shows a Mercury 45 (the New Colony Six song, in fact) morphing into a CD.So hit the ""used"" piles at your local store and see if you get lucky, like I did."
3,most are stereo,"except for ""love is blue"", these were all issued on the 1988 ""45's on CD vol III (66-69) on Mercury (div. of Polygram). Tom's review sums it up pretty well. This one is fine since you probably won't see the original anywhere. it's a shame Rebound cut the series down to the obligatory 10 tracks (so they can make a profit) instead of offering a full CD of their vast hit singles catalog."
5,Lasts and Lasts,"I've had my K&N air filter for my F-150 4.6L engine for 3 years now, and it continues to perform above expectations. Even the cleaning process is a snap, and gives me reassurance that I will continue to get a lot more life out of it. What I like the most about this product is its almost immediate results when it comes to acceleration (though I'm not really into stepping on it these days), as well as the 11% fuel savings I generate on the highway; I have proven this time and time again for the same 232 mile jaunt. This air filter has put money in my pocket over the years. I highly recommend this product, especially in the new era of high gas prices and price-gouging."
3,Great reputation,I installed the filter in a motorhome on a Ford F53 chassis Triton V-10.I seem to have a little extra power but have not driven enough to really tell. Mileage seems to have increased a little.
1,One Of The WORST Out There,"I have been teaching metaphysics for many years, and this is undoubtedly one of the WORST books I have ever come across. It rambles at times, the grammar is nothing short of deplorable, and it is certainly over priced."
4,good value,"Well balanced, good price, good quality. The product is worth selecting for use as a practice and a performance baton."
1,Too cumbersome,"Pain in the paatute to use. Not worth the effort. Hard to assemble, and you have to assemble it every time you change the pad."
4,"Simple, effective and easy to use","I had originally bought a tray, but it wasn't the size it claimed to be (if the dimensions says it's 17x17 and it looks like a rectangle...it's not 17x17). I found the tray to be cumbersome and it's just sitting in the closet. Got this one instead and am very pleased with it. My yorkie puppy was getting a terrible habit of chewing/ripping her wee pads apart. Not sure if it was a game to her or she was anxious since I wasn't home. This has easily solved that problem. The frame holds the pad in place and fits the entire pad with a little bit to spare. Granted it's in 8 pieces and if your dog misses....you have to clean the plastic, but same holds true w/ a tray. Invest in some cleaning wipes for easy wiping. As for the assembling, it's not too difficult and I'm sure you can glue the bottom part of the frame together if it really bothers you. I like that the frame disassembles into smaller pieces, makes traveling w/ the frame easier."
3,Would be better if the pieces locked together.,"I use training pads constantly for a disabled dog. She recently began chewing the pads if they were left on the ground at all and would sometimes not make it onto the pad as a result of it bunching. I ordered this frame hoping to deal with some of those issues. It has helped significantly as it keeps the pad taut so that she almost always makes it onto the pad. The pieces are a little bulky and she has short legs, so sometimes we miss. The primary complaint with this product is that there is a top and a bottom frame consisting of 4 parts each. If you will be moving the pad around, which I do, they sometimes come apart. As a result, I have to be careful to keep it together. If I had no need to move the frame, I would have no complaints."
2,Not that great...,"We purchased this pad holder hoping that it would keep our chihuahua from missing his pee pad. While it did make it a little better, pee just ended up on the frame. When this happens, you have to take the thing apart and then clean it. This was a lot more annoying than just cleaning the floor. After using it for about a week, we went right back to just leaving the pad on the floor."
1,HORRIBLE AND STUPID!!!,"This thing is in 8 pieces and does not permanantly fasten. You have to take the 4 TOP pieces off EVERY time you change the pad then replace the 4 pieces, like a jigsaw puzzle but not as complicated. It WOULD have worked great at holding the pad but there is no way i would take the whole thing apart and put it back together 4 times a day!"
2,Same song repeats..over and over...and over,"To start I must say that my 14 month old; whom we bought this toy for, absolutely loves my daughter's Monster High motion detector alarm. The motion detector screams, makes spookie noises, and basically sounds like a haunted house. This same 14 month old hates this toy. Mind you, she did like it until the first time I placed batteries into it and turned it on. She runs to the opposite side of the room and cries until it is shut off. I blame it on the horrible song it has that has nothing to do with sports or uk. Strange..."
2,dissappointing read,If you're looking for a book that provides insite into what it's like to fly versus migs or against heavily defended airpace look elsewhere. If you want to read about someone's life on the ground during Vietnam and their philosophy on the war this is your book. I would rate Thud Ridge and 100 Missions North many times more insitefull then this book.
1,Author needs to get over himself.,"I started reading this book on the recommendation of a WW2 combat wounded pilot.I was interested because I flew as an enlisted crewman in the same airspace, around the same time. I gave the book one star for the memories that it brought back to me.I had to give it up around page 155. The author seems to be too arrogant and bigoted for me. I wasn't able to separate the story from the storyteller.He even rated his own book on Amazon with 5 stars. Very narcissistic.Glad I didn't have to buy the book.This is just my personal opinion. It isn't intended to detract from the reviews of those who enjoyed it.BTW. It was Hanoi Hanna, not Hanoi Jane"
5,Its a Case for sure,"It is the chrome vanadium blade as opposed to the old high carbon steel or SS blades that I have on some of my case knifes, but it is still very sharp."
1,Poor quality,Looked nice out of the package. For the price point I was not expecting anything outstanding. I cut a small piece of fruit with it and immediately wiped the knife down. The blade became discolored and will not come off.
4,actually 4.78 stars,"OK folks-- remember this is 1972-- this is a live radio broadcast-- they are mixing on the flyA stunning representation of the Bowie experienceSure the levels are off from time to time i.e. Jean Genie, but look at it as a whole entity, warts and all. He flubs lyrics in Suffragette City (which he did again just recently in Cleveland 2004), the mix can be questionable from time to time BUT IT'S 1972!! A stunning collection of songs and better than the original version of the Ziggy Sardust movie S/T. Mick Ronson proved he was the next guitar god. Crank it up!"
4,*Wonderful* live performance...,"An addicting album, definitely. My copy was stolen recently, and I'm trying desperately to find another copy. It's especially nice if you happen to have ""Ziggy Stardust the Motion Picture,"" and can envision the actual show. But even without that, it's spectacular! :-)"
3,Super Reader,"Tom O'Bedlam is seen as a crazy person, raving about weird things like aliens and other planets and places and all sorts of other things that seem ludicrous to the people around him.However, it is possible that Tom is really very sane, and the human race will need him and his abilities to communicate with and transport to other places.That is if he isn't just really killing a bunch of people."
1,Just plain bad.,"First of all, I'm not a conservative, so don't discount the review on that basis. I also trashed ""Help! Mom! There Are Liberals Under My Bed!"" Both books suffer from dogmatic stereotypes and are inappropriate for children. But beyond that, ""No, George, No,"" is just plain bad. Poorly written and poorly illustrated, it's a crummy kids book. Period. Save your money and buy something by Eric Carle or Richard Scarry. In other words, by a good children's book."
1,Horrible,"As a hardcore liberal I think this book is horrible. To read such political hack job to children is bad. This is as bad as ""Help Mom there's a liberal under my bed."" Teaching your children such garbage is a case for your reparenting. If you get it for yourself, than it's just another liberal book making fun of Bush."
1,"No, Kathy, No","It's a shame it's become so politically correct to bash Bush. What's worse is to ""hide"" behind the cloak of a child's book to do it. By the way I wonder if the author has taken the opportunity to illustrate what other presidents have done (ie in the Oval Office)? I would not read my child this book. The book itself is built on a false premise. Could you imagine the outrage (ie on The Today Show from Katie) if someone had done a book like this about John Kerry. The liberals would demand it be torn from the bookshelves and would call on every good citizen to boycott Amazon and Borders."
1,How about a book titled the Re-Parenting of Kerry?,Or maybe the Re-Parenting of Clinton? Books like this should be rated PG....meaning you are Pretty &#65279;Gullible to read them.
1,"NO, Kathy, NO!","This is just sad. If you're going to write a political book, at least do it in a mature way for an audience who cares. A mediocore children's book filled with sugar-coated lies is an absolutly pathetic way to make your opinions known."
5,Great Product!,I love this product! I use it 3 times a week and love how it leaves my face feeling clean and smooth and younger looking.
4,Good music for the money,Overall I like this compilation. The selection of songs is pretty good. I prefer to listen to CD2 more because of the type of music and how its mixed. There are some songs I dont particularly like but 2 CD's for $15 -- its a pretty good value.My fiance and I have been out of the club scene for a while --- this set makes us want to get back in! For the money it cant be beat.
3,too much like Annual 2005 .. but it's still great,"The songs on this album are pretty good, with songs such as Lola's Theme, Call On Me, Put Em' High, Stay (the David Guetta one), When The Dawn Breaks, Stay (the one by Kim Sozzi), Stronger On My Own, and Just Be. It's definitely like the Annual 2005 ((which was mixed better)) but it has some great songs on it that the Annual doesn't have. I recommend buying the Annual 2005 because the mixing is better and there are some good songs on there too .. but this cd is still great!!"
3,Its not Ultra Dance,"I was spoiled and looked forward to each new release of the Ultra Dance series. Yes, there were some klunkers on a couple of the earlier compilations but I rarely listen to one of the disks and the other is listenalbe but there are much better mixes out there."
2,NY DJ's can't all be great,"Once again Ultra records has put it's trust into New York DJ's, and the results are not pleasing. Disc one mixed by Vic Latino from NYC is good enough for radio (stick to KTU) but not for the higher standards set by the UK DJ's who are always well ahead of the game. Bad song choices and even worse mix choices make Disc 1 a failure.Disc 2 mixed by The Riddler, also a NYC DJ is a vast improvment and he should be commended on his effort and this just proves not all DJ's from NYC are all bad. Better song choices here more on the Trance side but with enough vocal power to keep you moving. This Disc will be the one you play the most.But for the money it's still a deal. I've liked Ultra's Trance CD's alot better, but if your looking for real club music stay with a proven winner and check out Ministry Of Sound, you can't go wrong with any of their CD's"
3,Just Alright....,Not one of the greatest Ultra CD's and I love most of them. The first CD sounds like something from the 70's with the girl vocals. Kinda disco. Its just OK.
4,Flora Powder,The product didn't seem to work for me as well as it did others that where in the same detox program but I plan to give it another go after the holidays so I hope it will work better for me then.
1,"Cute, but poor design results in breakage","I bought two sets of these earrings, one pair for each of my daughters. The earrings were so pretty and they were excited to wear them. Unfortunately, one earring from each set broke by the second day. The frame that the gems sit in is much too flimsy. The leaf broke away from the flower! Mind you my daughters are ballet dancers and do not play soccer or other rough sports. I cannot blame the breakage on anything other than a weak design. Do not buy these earrings, you will waste your money."
1,childrens screw back earrings,"I was so happy when I saw these pair of earrings on amazon shopping list & my daughter just got her ears pierce, so I could have it as a Christmas give for her. Turn out the purple pink colors is not colors at all & it is just all white crystal around it. I was very disappoint."
2,not what i thought,It's mostly dried strips of tomatoes. My guess is that they do that because the other ingredients are too light. I was not impressed and I could not use it for soup. Perhaps baked dishes that go with tomatoes.
1,JUNK,The cork is a low grade that cracks easily and doesn't fit an alto. I had to bore out the hole with some sand paper I had at home. Then I had to spend 2 hours doing more sanding so my mouth piece could fit. Also the glue had a hole poked in it and was all over the other pieces..... spend a little more money and save yourself a lot of time and headache!
3,Make sure you know what your doing.,This was my first time trying to replace my alto sax neck cork. I dont know if I wet the cork too long or not long enough. Long story short. The cork split and it look like it was to small for my sax all together. Plus the green things in the pic didnt even come with the package.
3,First Time,"It was my son first time using the kit. He followed the instructions, but it didn't work. We will try again"
2,Definitely need to know what you are doing.,"Got this kit to replace the cork on my son's Alto that he inherited from me. The original had deterioratedand I did not want to spend the $100+ the local shop wanted to replace it. Did everthing according to the directions, and it separated in two after being greased and attempting to place the mouthpiece on the neck.The pads and little green fuzzy stoppers worked fine, but the cork is why I bought it to begin with.May end up having to let the shop do it."
4,A very concise and helpful little book,"The Catholic Response is a great book to assist both Catholics and non-Catholics in understanding the Catholic position of many of the Catholic doctrines that confound the average person. With a mixture of history, logic and Sacred Scripture, Father Stravinskas makes the topic of every chapter come alive and the reader finishes every chapter with a sense of, ""well, of course."" Father Stravinskas always takes the high road in his approach. The Catholic Response was written as a response to an anti-Catholic screed written by Jimmy Swaggart back in the 1980's. Despite the fact that the Catholic Response has been updated since Swaggart's public disgrace, Fr. Stravinskas makes no ad hominem attack but rather treats the topic of Swaggart, as he does all topics in the book, with charity. At this price point, this is a great book to have a few copies on hand to give to anyone with questions about the Faith."
4,Good read but lacking in substance,"I found this book to be an easy read, suitable for anyone who is interested in basic Catholic apologetics. Although this book does not appear to be intended for serious study it is still a useful guide for those who wish to know some basics about the Catholic faith. It contains some good arguments for the most common oppositions to the Catholic Church and is an excellent starting point for anyone who wants to pursue further study."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This is a great little book. You follow along as Adams revisits many of the places where the Wright Brothers went. Just like any such visitor, he revels in the little things he finds that match up with some bit of the legend, like finding a building where they stayed; or the hospital where Orville was laid up after the first fatal crash. He also finds evidence of the huge impact Wilbur made in France where he was hailed as a hero. Who'd have thought there was a ""Wilbur Street"" in France?No, this is no substitute for those blow-by-blow accounts of each innovation, but it fills in the gaps and adds some chronolgy that others lack. For example, he mentions how Orville's crash happened while Wilbur was in Europe, and how long it had been since Orville had last flown.This is a fine book, and if you've ever gone on your own trek to try and get a sense of history by ""being there"", you won't be able to put it down."
2,Incredibly,boring. Even if you're fascinated by the Wright brothers. That's because the author writes less about the Wrights (who are interesting) than about himself (unbelievably dull). Pretentious junk. Skip it.
5,Perfect Solutio at the Right Price,Love it! Works perfectly to load up mu full suspension bike on my trunk rack. The unit is very solid and easy to get on and off. The locking swing arms are seem strong and secure. Just remember to add a bungee cable from the bottom of the bike to the rack to deter the bike from swinging toward and away from the vehicle. I would highly recommend this product.
3,Does the job.,Used it 3 times now. I worry a little that the little button catch could break free free and let the latch open. That would be an extremely bad thing on the road. You should probably fasten the bike with some additional velcro straps or something as an added safety measure. I would not think any of the other adapters are much more sturdy so for the price this was fine.
4,Worked great!,This will probably not work for a child's bike but worked great for my wife's bike. Fits easily and with no fuss between the seat and gooseneck and makes loading her bike a breeze.
3,"Well made, except for broken elastic.","The elastic inside the bar snapped the first time the bar was extended - with VERY little force applied. I disassembled the bar and removed the elastic to find it was very badly frayed where it broke. Obviously it was like this when it left the vendor. I repaired it using a small bungee cord and everything seems to be OK. I have not requested a refund or replacement as it now works fine. However, the vendor should look into possible QC issues. I'm posting this here because there is no option in past orders to contact seller once an item has been delivered EXCEPT to arrange for a replacement or refund.The bar itself seems strong and well made. I'm sure it will do the job."
4,Sturdy adaptor,"This adaptor is sturdy and easy to use. There is a button you press to open for installing and uninstalling. I bought it to use on a full size bike that does not have the top tube. I was able to use it on the bike and carry on my Kingpin 4 without issues. I was also able to put it on my daughter's bike which is 21 inches. I have not tried to put her bike on the carrier yet, but I am a little concerned because it does not look like there is a lot of clearance with the adaptor to mount her bike on the carrier."
5,Works Great!,This frame adapter is very sturdy and works great. In fact I'm ordering two more so we can have one for each of our bikes on the rack.
5,Just the ticket,"Works great with my full-suspension mtn bike and Thule rack. Sturdy, easy to use, adjustable."
3,Illustrations,"I was impressed with the thoroughness of the herbal information in this book, and doubly impressed by the superb illustrations!"
3,"These are so cool, and you get more in this than with the bow tie ones.","very cool, but it's expensive. If I was getting it for my own kids I'd go with an off brand to get more for the price. Saw some great options on Etsy.comBut these were a gift so they were worth it."
2,Soundtrack????,"The story I feelt would have been great, but the development was below B-budget. I've also always felt that a soundtrack truly either makes the movie or destroys it, and this one definitely destroyed it! I would have given 3 stars but the music was unbelievably out of place. Okay to watch but definitely wouldnt buy."
2,A Great cast but very twisted plot!!,"This movie grabs your attention when you see the A-List cast that stars in this film, but the dark and twisted plot takes a \ away so much from the film. ""13"" tracks a young man(Sam Riley) who's family is in need of money and comes across as an opportunity to make a huge amount of money and help his family out of their financial woes.The story gets interesting as the secretive job becomes known and this is where the story begins. The large money investors have to make bets on who will survive the Russian roulette style game by giving the winner of the game almost two million dollars. The sub-plot includes a Mickey Rourke storyline that includes 50 cent and the story loses me somewhat right there.This movie has a great cast, great acting, but the dark and barbaric plot makes you lose most of your interest in the movie. I want to give it 3 stars for the three great actors but I have to take away a star for the dismal plot."
2,Disappointing,"I expected much more from this movie with the stellar cast and suspenseful premise. However, I was left disappointed by this poorly executed film. This film seemed to take the script from others as a desperate man takes a job as a desperate act. Without knowing what he was doing he finds himself in a high-stakes games of Russian roulette and given the player number 13.With Jason Statham, Mickey Rourke, Alexander Skarsgard, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Gabby Hoffmann, and David Zayas I expected this film would be outstanding and was confused as to why I didn't hear more about the release of this film prior to the DVD release. Upon further investigation I discovered that this film was made in 2008 and was not released until 2010 in theaters and 2011 on dvd. I know why they waited.If you are itching to watch this movie, I recommend renting it."
4,Great suspense thriller!!,"Very dark. Kept me on edge all the time. Great cast and acting (well, except for 50 ;)). You should watch it!"
1,one of the worst movies I have ever seen,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Save your money. I wish someone would have warned me. I cant believe that this movie even got a 3 star rating.
1,WHAT VERSION IS THIS?,"There must be two versions of this film,because this is not the same movie i've watched.They added this stupid music to the film that takes away from the coldness,raw,and tension of the movie that makes this film so awesome.Do not buy this version buy the international version of this movie with jason statham."
1,Slow and slower,"You Lose you die 13 ...I can honestly say I lost interest in this film half way through, three quarters through I stop the machine and found better things to do with my time.I do not know what I expected, but what ever it was I did not get there.No recommendations and one star."
1,13 = Crap,"Crap. Crap, crap, crap. Crap. Crap. Crapity crap crap crap. Kuh-rap. Kerrrr-raahhhp. Crrrrrrraaaaaahhhpp.Crap, crap, crap-ah-crap-ah-crap-crap. Crap.Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, C, R, A, P, Crap."
2,Boring but at least the cast was good,"Although Jason Statham isn't in the movie that much, he is the main reason to recommend this film. The story is quite confusing, but that might just be because I was bored through most of it. Luckily it isn't very long (just over ninety minutes). The plot concerns a Russian Roulette tournament, with Sam Riley as Vincent Ferro being the main contestant. Fans of Mickey Rourke will want to check out his role as a man forced to participate in this disturbing game. Statham steals the show as a very intense and very wealthy individual who participates - not by playing, but by betting on the contestants. Ray Winstone is also pretty good as a mentally disturbed person who is partaking in the competition. But all in all, this is hardly the kind of movie many people will want to watch more than once, if they can even get through it the first time. The presence of stars Statham and Rourke are the main reason to take an interest."
3,Disappointing remake of 13 Tzameti,"The original French film compoetely wowed me as one of the most intense Films noir I have ever seen. I did have hopes for this remake since the original director was at the helm. Unfortuinately, he must have allowed himself to be influenced by others because this remake just doesn't get off the ground. The premise is great, and this isn't a bad film. But I do recommend also getting hold of the original after you've seen this."
3,Not Bad..,"My husband and I watched the movie 13 and thought it was pretty good. It's very action packed. It also has very good actors in it. The movie kept me interested in watching to see how things would turn out. If you're into action movies, I highly recommend this one!"
3,Rent but don't buy.,"JS is one of my favorite actors and he rarely, for me, has acted in a bad movie but this rates no more than a ""C"". This movie has lots of action and twists and turns but some will find the hard to believe amoral plot disgusting. Still, considering the vast number of horrible movies out there, this is worth the cost of a rental. Don't buy, you won't want to watch it twice."
2,"Less drama than ""Let's Make a Deal""","Less drama than ""Let's Make a Deal""...that's the first thing my husband said when this movie was over, and I'm strongly inclined to agree. I was never on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. This was a thriller with no suspense. None whatsoever. The plot is extremely predictable, even the ending was easy to see coming. For a professionally-made movie, everything about it came off as amateurish.No real character development to speak of, which is the real tragedy of this movie. It has a stellar cast, all of whom deserved better than the weak storytelling. I never saw the original, but '13' never had me invested in any of the characters. And not even really in the protagonist, whose actions at times really defy logic.I'm all for shoot-em-ups with no plot, but this movie didn't even achieve that level. A big disappointment."
4,Good action movie,"We watched this last night and both of us (couple in our 30's) really liked the movie and it was better than we were expecting. The acting was pretty good, the action was intense and kept you on edge until the very end. I like that they kept it about the story and the action, no cheesy strip club or graphic nudity scenes that seem to run rampant in this genre. There was violence...but considering the storyline, it was expected and they did just the right level of it I thought. It gave you the feel of the room without going overboard. It's the kind of movie that sparks discussion too. One of the better action films that we've seen lately."
1,Belongs on The Top 10 Worst Movies of All Time,"First, Jason Statham must really need money to stoop so low as to be in this movie - and in a limited role. The premise of this movie would elude the most genius among us, and the story is completely brainless. In a nutshell, this movie subtracts from the sum total of all human knowledge. Sponge Bob is more entertaining than this ""never shoulda been made"" movie. That said, the movie does have one really good part - THE END of the movie."
4,Lots of suspence,This is a Great Moview. Kept me on the seat all the time. I strongly recommended it. The ending is quite good.
2,Deeply Disappointed.,"Jason Statham + Mickey Rourke + Ray Winstone = What the heck happened to this movie!? This movie should have been amazing. Gela Babluani had a great cast to work with and yet the movie blew chunks. The only entertaining part was the ""Ringmaster"" and his histrionics. And the little sister not getting her lamb with the black ears, well, that just pissed me off. I gave it two stars because I have too much respect, generally for the aforementioned cast members to completely poop on it. But, for crying out loud! You freakin' blew it, Gela!"
3,"nice little action flm starring Jason Statham, Mickey Rourke, and Ray Winstone","This is nice little action film, it's actaully a remake of French film.it Stars Jason Statham (Transporter and Crank series), Mickey Rourke (The Wrestler, Harley Davidson and The Marlboro Man), Ray Winstone (Scum, Beowulf) and rapper/actor Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson.This film could have better, but I still liked it overall.It does make me now want to see the original French film."
4,Okay,"Its okay not the greatest, but definitely a must watch if your into men blowing their heads off on a game of chance."
1,Wish it could get less than one...,"I Got this 'cause I like Statham's Transporter character and style. This is not it. He actually plays his supporting role well, but you gotta hate the guy. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever for me. Horrible story, ugly concept, and the only semblance of a 'good guy' loses at the end... Would not ever watch it again, it was just awful. Makes me wonder just how many young 'tough guys' are gonna sit around tables drinking and playing with loaded revolvers after seeing this godforsaken mess of a movie...:("
1,Waste of talent,"How in the heck can someone waste the great talents of Alexander Skarsgard, Jason Statham, and Mickey rourke? This has got to be one of the worst movies ever! Completely boring. Glad I bought it used and only paid a few dollars for it. It is garbage and don't waste your time or money."
1,sucked,"This was the one of the worst movies ever..the story line sucked, the actors hardly acted, the acting was poor. This movie was so bad I wish I would have never rented it. Statham and Rourke must have been hard up for cash and both dont deserve anything for being involved with this lame flick."
1,Not even Jason Statham can save this one....,"If you are considering buying this movie for Jason Statham, Mickey Rourke, or Alexander Skarsgard, my advice to you is simple. Don't.The premise is pretty basic. A young man overhears a plan to make money and decides to follow up. What he finds is a group of men participating in Russian Roulette- with no way out but victory or death.What a dreary, unappealing movie! Mickey Rourke's side story was the only ""highlight"" of the film. As much as I love Jason Statham's movies, not even his appearances could make this one entertaining. Over and over, we watched men standing in a circle, pulling the trigger, and some men dying as a result. Quite honestly, it was one of the most depressing, boring films I've ever suffered through in my life. No suspense, no tension, no action, and not much of a storyline. Very disappointing as this film had a good cast!"
3,"just okay, could have been more.",I think fiddy cent should stick to rapping and leave his sub par acting career alone. The rest of the actors did fine but the events could have been portrayed in a more exciting way. Just okay.
1,Worst Toy Ever Purchased from Amazon,"Scratches, loose screws that cannot be tightened, and poorest quality ever! Shockingly inferior in every way!"
3,Good for ages 2-4,"This guitar is good for young kids, but it doesn't really tune correctly. Don't get it if you intend to teach your child how to play."
2,Broken,"When it arrived, it was broken. Was able to fix it either a few tools and some super glue so I could wrap it up for my son for Christmas, but wondering how long it will last."
4,Nice guitar for young child,"Purchased this guitar for my 4 year old grandson. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it because it seems to be better made than previous children's guitars I have purchased thru Amazon. Having the fixed bridge is a huge improvement. Now to see how long it will last thru the use, and punishment, it will get."
2,Not worth it...,"The guitar came 123 (thanks seller) but the quality of the product lacks. If you want a disposable guitar and have money to throw away, then this the the guitar for you. The guitar broke at the neck within a few days."
5,Awesome!,"Spine Tingling. Wow. That is all I can say. This is a wonderful and sad journey. To see such young people face such horror, throwing their lives away, yet feel their love for each other, fear, desperation. This is truly a modern day Bonnie and Clyde!!"
3,Thrilling for a documentary.,"Obviously, this is not my type of movie fare, but it looked interesting in a mysterious way, and it does not disappoint. From the chilling 911 calls in the opening seconds, to the unfolding of bizarre interviews, this documentary is really a psychological mystery that tries to explain why two ""good"" young people went on a murder spree. The documentary ends up searching for the home movie made by the criminals, ""Video X: Evidence."" ""Video X: Evidence"" I'm sure is too violent for me to want to view, but one does wonder what is on the tape. Although I feel sorry for the two young killers, their deeds are reprehensible. It is a sad commentary on the bleaker aspects of our children and society, and shows why a healthy family unit is truly the most important institution we have. Beware of the graphic crime photos, which might be prohibitive for some viewers."
1,A search for a documentary...,"This was simply a waste of time. A Blair Witch rip-off I suspect, this effort was from the start obviously a fake. The movie is classified as a documentary. It is not.The end, the clip of the mythical video x, makes it clear that this is just some lame attempt to emulate BW. I guess if you want to waste a few hours this is a good place....J"
2,mock-umentary,"**caution spoilers**None of the facts of this ""documentary"" check out. I was willing to put up with the awkward (amateurish) documentary style for an interesting story, but the story itself doesn't do much to hold attention. The aggressive style of the cameraman/interviewer is inconsistent with genuine documentary. This ends up feeling like a ""Blair Witch"" wannabe without talent, originality, or suspense. Now it looks like Vanguard will be marketing ""Video X,"" the alleged target of the documentarians in this waste of time. Save yourself the aggrevation and watch something--anything--else."
4,Great Documentary,This documentary really takes you to the south. It's dark and eerie while still giving alot of information about the killings of Dwayne and Darla Jean. This is a must see for true-crime junkies. Some footage is included from Video X. I'll be looking for a copy of that if and when it comes out.
1,murder in the heartland,this video really sucked!! i tried to convince myself it was okay but found myself in a greater and greater struggle to keep watching. It was hard to get through and the only thing i think that really kept me watching it was to try not to feel like i wasted 3 bucks on the internet. It just seemed fake and like a real waste of time!!!
3,Fake Reviews for a Fake Documentary,"This film is ok, but doesn't quite make you feel like you are watching a real documentary. The subtext of searching for video X makes it really seem even less believable.I find it funny that people are padding the Amazon reviews with fake reviews of this picture like its really a documentary. Blair Witch wasn't that good to begin with, and that trick has been done so let's move on amateur film makers.I'm frankly suprised the makers of the Charlie Starkweather film of 1993 with Tim Roth haven't sued over copyright infringement."
1,Flash Gordon-spaceship to the unknown,I adored Flash Gordon- (buster crabbe) and the movie plot and all of the film props used. What I did not like was the very poor viewing quality of this particular version because there were alot of white lines running through the film. One can tell that in this edition the film needed to be cleaned up.rk.swim@gmail.com
3,"Not really good, but about the only thing available.","The book is laid out in a confusing manner in many ways, and it is difficult to be certain that the section you're looking at actually pertains to your vehicle year/engine. It has good information, but it will take you time to find it. Part of the problem is that it tries to cover too many years and vairations."
1,Dodge Ram 50/D-50 Pick-Ups & Raider 1979 thru 1993,The book lacks detail and is not user-friendly. The information for torque specifications is located in the beginning of the chapter rather than in the location of the repair being made. Having the information set up this way is very frustrating because you have to back track to get the information which is a waste of time. I also found a mistake in a wiring diagram for the ECU.
2,Unnecessary,"Though this live lp is not atrocious, it is lacking in anything that would make it a necessary purchase, particularly musical energy. Nothing on here betters or even equals the original (though the version of ""Australians in Europe"" is good on its own terms). Completists will need this, but otherwise pass."
1,You can get this cheaper on the lasko website,These filters are only $4.00 plus ground shipping (which goes up a little for each additional filter) on the lasko website. Why anyone would pay over $10 with shipping for it here on amazon is beyond me.
1,BAD FILTER FROM FILTER-NOW,"The filters I received from Filter-Now are 3/4-inch thinner. Two of them about 1 inch longer, and one is about 3/4-inch shorter. The cuts were very rough and appear to have been torn by hand. Very poor quality. I'll never buy wick filters thru amazon.com"
2,Not impressed....,"I read another person's review on the ""Best of The Cure"". He said that it wasn't even close to being as good as ""Staring at the Sea"". He was wrong. I was very bored with Staring at the Sea. I wish I would have gotten the Greatest Hits instead."
2,Crying all the way to the bank,"Looks like this dude's mournful lyrics and sad sound have payed off well. Now, if he would only take a little Viagra and call it a day...."
1,Got the tape instead??????????,They sent me the tape instead - very poor service and i am really mad that they had the nerve to charge me anyway...what do i do????
5,"Dancing, dancing in our hands.","This is a very good cure album, even more so for the newer fan base. a very good addition for anyones cd collection."
4,A very fine education in the early days of the Cure.,"This is a very excellent overview of the earlier recordings of the cure. This would be an very good way for newer cure fans to get a fell for there ""teeth cutting"" recordings. I know there is a new generation of cure fans spawned by the immensly powerfull ""bloodflowers"" album. And I think that if they want to start in on the old music, this is a good starting point, very enjoyable."
2,Missing so much,"The original tape (yes I said tape as in cassette - released in 1986) had all of these songs merely as Side A. Side B had 12 bonus b-side tracks which can be found on Join the Dots, released 19 years later. Until then, the analog version of Staring at the Sea was the only place to find such tracks as New Day, I'm Cold, Throw Your Foot and and Mr. Pink Eyes other than tracking down the original 45s and 12"" records. This CD is The Cure in it's prime, but for an old fan feels like only buying half an album - and only the half I already have at that. If you want the B side of the tape, go buy Join the Dots instead."
1,This used to be a singles compilation w/B sides,"the original release of Staring at the Sea contain the B-sides to all the singles on Side2 of the cassette. THAT WAS THE BEST PART!!! You listened to all the hits from side1, flipped the tape and descended into pure Cure weirdness for another 35 minutes. There is quite simply no reason not to include the B-sides on this re-issue, even as a double-disk. Hopefully Rhino takes the hint."
1,Please add the b-sides back!,"I love this album, I grew up with it. That said...the tape version has an additional set of b-sides that went with the singles (another full album basically). Where did it go? Bring it back. I want it on cd too."
4,The Cure - Young & Wild,"This is a great collection of The Cure's early works. Just when I thought I knew most of their early music, this album got me up-to-date. If you're a Cure fan, you MUST own this album!"
4,Where did the B-Sides go?,"Great must have for any Cure fan or Cure newbie.I bought this to replace my ages-old tape...that I loved to death. Unfortunately, the CD doesn't include the B-Sides (Standing on a Beach) that the tape had. That truly was the best part and I'm disappointed that it is gone (I'm also not about to spend $50 for the B-Sides collection)."
4,Wheel of Fortune,"I love to play Wheel of Fortune game So Fun!!!!my favor Wheel of Fortune!Thank you, Pam Johnson"
5,Campbell Hausfeld MP6000 works great,"I've had mine about 18 months.Personal use, so it doesn't get used that often.Mine looks just like the picture, with a straight-on chuck.I prefer the straight-on chuck. It generally gives the best access to the valve.It is so convenient - one hand operation.If there is one complaint - once in awhile, I wish the chuck had a swivel, for some of the tight fit rims.The price has gone up a couple dollars, but I would still recommend it to anyone."
3,Campbell Hausfeld MP6000 Tire Inflator with gauge.,"The money transaction appears to have gone well. The MP6000 has a problem with the air deflate valve (reducing an over inflate), it will not release the air from the target being filled. The MP6000 is still well worth the price."
4,Price point is impressive,"I bought this unit because I was looking for a way to pump up bike tires via my air compressor and be able to measure the pressure without using a pressure gauge afterwards. This does not support presta valves, however I am in the process of converting it to support presta. I was going to build one using parts at homedepot and this is by far the cheapest way you can get a handle, gauge etc..."
1,Used 4 times then broken,"I get the fact that you cannot expect too much for 14.00, but I actually figured this would last longer then it did. After 4 uses the pressure gauge got stuck on 120 and that was that. Not so easy filling tires when you have no idea how many Psi your at. Now i'm sure someone will say I didn't take care of it, but I am fanatical about my tools, to the point where my wife tells me I take better care of them then her. Maybe I just got a dud, it happens, just don't expect the world for 14.00."
4,Gauge range is not correct in product description,"The pressure gauge is 0-150 PSI, not 0-100 PSI as advertised in the product description. Other than that it works fine."
1,tight,"fitts to tight and the rubber inside the fill valve ripped apart and leaks around handle really bad, air tank drains way to quickly"
1,Max Pressure is 100PSI not 150PSI,the description said it was max 150PSI but the one i got said 100 Max PSI and i didnt realize it said that a till after it stopped working.
1,VERY CHEAPLY MADE!!!!,"Buyer beware the flimsy clip on to the tire breaks almost instantly. By some manner I was able to fix it, but I am considering it extremely fragile. AND the gage is totally off. So it is basically useless cause I have still have use another gage I trust after using this poorly made product."
1,Zero Stars - Piece of junk,Gauge did not work immediately upon opening package and attaching to air hose. Poor quality control.
2,disappointed,didn't read all the reviews before bought it. I thought 4 stars were good enough. now I read the reviews and can understand why users weren't too happy with it. this thing should not get more than 2 stars. the chuck design has a major flaw as others already pointed out and the gauge reading was inaccurate.
2,WOW NOT,Is this seller kidding? You can buy this 10.00 cheaper at Walwart.Also another irritating thing is you have to find a female quick connect to screw onto the handle... NONE of the male will fit due to the hole being too small....
3,Connector not compatible,"Ordered the gauge and the Porter Cable Pancake Compressor as a combination as suggested by Amazon. The compressor arrived last week and I received the CH gauge today. The gauge connection is not compatible with the compressor quick connect coupler.Now I have to hunt for a way to connect to the hose quick connector on the compressor. You would think if hey say order as a combination, there should be no problem connecting. Did read a previous review [to late] mentioning the problem with connecting. Will take a look in Advance Auto and see if I can find the connector there."
3,"OK for large vehicles, outstanding for small wheels with inner tubes, iffy for bicycles, caution on the high pressure limit","Fairly easy to use. It works well for airing large vehicle tires. Gauge is a couple pounds off but consistent even at lower pressures so once you know that it's not a problem. While the gauge has a 150 lb limit the valve itself is stamped with a 100 lb pressure limit notice, which can be exceeded by most compressors. Especially good for small tubed tires like garden carts, furniture dollies and such where the wheels have inner tubes. It avoids the need to put pressure on the top of the valve and thus does not push the valve stem into the wheel. I would not recommend this for use on bicycle tires, primarily because of the pressure limit that takes it out of range for many bike tires. Also, the straight connector (not right angle) is slightly cumbersome amid the spokes."
3,Works,"Despite using teflon tape, in some positions this leaks at the connector to the Goodyear 045 hose. It could be the hose connnectors rather than the guage. A little fiddling and it seals. The guage is consistent with another dial guage I use. It connects easily to tire valves on my cars and motorcycle. I would give higher rating if I knew it did not cause the leak."
4,150PSI Guage,"When I received the MP6000 Tire Inflator with Gauge I noticed that the body of the unit said ""Caution 100PSI Maximum"" but the attached gauge goes from 0-150PSI. I wish it had the 100PSI gauge as shown in the picture so that I would get better resolution. Other than that, the Inflator works well and I'm glad I purchased it."
4,easy tire inflation,easy to inflate; easy to take pressure reading; easy to add or release air pressure; what's not to like? Pressure gauge is accurate to +/- 1 lb/sq. inch. Inflation hose could be a little longer to eliminate stooping.
3,"Good, but you can get better for half the price",The problem is the lock-on chuck. The size and basic design make it hard (or not possable because of limited access) to use and it does not always lock on well. You spend time getting it on right.For half the price there is a no-name brand version of this tire filler you can get here at Amazon or from Harbor Freight that has a compact clamp on chuck that is much easier to use and has no access issues. C-H chose the wrong chuck.
2,"unfortunate design for some tires, weak clip, poor spring assembly","The chuck and clip design doesn't work on some of my tires; it won't go deep enough on the tire stem. I saw this mentioned in a few other reviews. Besides that, the spring in the clip slipped out yesterday and keeps popping out even after I disassembled/reassembled the clip - there is no detent to hold the spring's ""foot"" on the metal base so it slips out repeatedly . I'm going to buy another inflator..."
3,I like the concept but it has a few flaws,"The gage could be better but it is OK. When cliped on to the tire stem, it does NOT always open the valve in teh stem all teh way and needs to be pushed on further and held by hand. There should be an adjustment for this but there are no instructions to tell you if or how you can make this adjustment.Overlall it is OK"
5,Best Tire Inflator I Have Ever Owned,I like this inflator gauge so well that I have now purchased three total in order to have one at each of our ranch's air compressors. It makes the task of airing up tires much quicker and easier. The hose is small enough to bend into a U shape for airing up rear dual tires on pickup trucks.
2,Wish I'd known another part was needed,"I haven't actually been able to use this guage because it doesn't come with the part that connects to the air hose; I have to go buy an adapter that screws into it before I can use it. It seems sturdy though, so hopefully once I get the other part it will work ok.ETA: After buying the adapter to connect it, we have found that it doesn't work well at all. It does not seem to accurately display the pressure, does not fill tires with air unless you hold it 'just right' - at one point we went from an underinflated tire to a completely FLAT tire before we could get it to work. I've since gone back to using the plain 'stick' style."
1,Inaccurate,This vague reads 45psi. Three other gagues in my garage indicates tire is 30psi. Need to figure out how to return it
5,easy to use tire gauge,"easy to use,great for motorcycles,good design,,durable build ,accurate dial gauge design.would recommend it to any one that is into motorcycles as it has a flexible hose."
3,Product is OK,The guage is about 5lbs off and the clamp does not seat well on the valve stem. The advertisement that it is able to be used w/ one hand is a bit optimistic since the mechansim that clamps the hose to the valve stem doesn't work great.Overall it fills my bike tires fine and once you know the error in the guage it works ok.
1,junk,Piece of junk does not lock on the stem as it should will work if you apply constant presure with your hand while you air up the tire.
2,Lead paint?!?!,"Half of the packaging is covered with warnings about the lead in the paint of this device. Works fine but after reading the warnings on the package, I want to wear gloves every time I touch it."
1,Did not fit my garages compressor,The compressor I am trying to fit it to is a standard one. Now I'm forced to go out and search for a solution.
3,Deflates air.,Actually the product itself can only deflate tire pressure from over inflated once. To inflate any tire with this product you need a motorized air compressor but most of the air compressor now a days comes with all the necessary accessories so anybody who is buying should know the specific use of this to them but as a product its good and with optimal quality.
2,Not sure how to use it,There is not instructions manual. The product came in just what you see in the picture. I still have no idea how to use it. Doesn't seem complicated but appearently there's something missing
2,Lasted two days,I am a tech at a dealer and purchased this hoping to use it daily. After two days the gauge reading was stuck on 20psi and would no longer inflate.
3,fast tire pressure adjustments,"Good about this tire inflator is the pressure release button. Bad is the ""clip-on hands-free design"" because it does not work: air is hissing out at all times because the hose is too stiff and too short hence pulling at the clip. The only way to use this unit is to keep the hose pressed onto the tire with one hand while making pressure adjustments with the other hand. I would give this unit 5 stars if it had a standard tire chuck with a 2 feet hose instead of this non-functional ""clip-on"" design."
1,pitched it,It never worked right and refused to stay on our valve stems. When it damaged the threads on one stem while popping off I pitched it.Amazon would probably refunded my money but I got more satisfaction from stuffing it in the trash can.
4,Campbell Hausfeld MP6000 Tire Inflator w/ Gauge,Works well for all my tire inflation needs. Priced right with prompt delivery. I'd give it 5 stars except that the gauge reads lots higher pressures that I'll ever use on my vehicles tires ~ I would have been happier with a gauge that reads up to maybe 60 PSI instead.
5,Regulators.,This inflator is perfect and does it job well. It also can let air out of the tires if you need to let some out. Had it for about 3 years and no problems with it yet.
2,Inflation chuck failed,I purchased this inflator to replace a high end inflator and gauge. What a disappointment. The inflation chuck failed to deliver air to the tire valve after a dozen uses. That rendered the whole mechanism useless. Beyond that failure the air tube is plastic and very difficult to use in cold weather. The hose is a tad too short. The gauge is a little small and difficult to read. The air bleeder worked well and the metal body was a pretty blue. It is inexpensive and certainly feels and looks inexpensive. I am a bit obsessive about things like tire pressure and oil levels. This gauge left me wishing I had spent another 10 or 15 bucks to get a better inflator/gauge.
1,Caution!,"I took good care of mine. Never dropped or anything of the sort. Used it to inflate a low tire and noticed it didn't look right after. It read 40 psi, but when second and third checked with 2 other tire pressure gauges, it's ""40 psi"" was well over 50. I am disappointed in it's inaccuracy and worries me to think what would have happened if I hadn't second guessed it and just drove on very over inflated tires."
2,Short service life,"Worked ok until the hose (rubber) rotted and started cracking and leaking air. The service life on this inflator was about 5 years with very little usage. My Grandfather always told me ""buy cheap, buy twice""...Think I will try the Milton Dual Chuck Tire Inflator With Gauge...hopefully it will be the last I ever buy."
1,doesn't work,"Soemtimes this inflator will work correctly, but mostly it just pegs out the dial indicator when the trigger is actuated. It seems as if the pressure from my compressor is making to the dial readout, but not making it into the inflation tube and subsequently into my tire.Horrible purchase, save your money."
1,Not recommended,"Every other air tool comes ready to take a 1/4"" NTP male connector, which are very common. This one requires a 1/4"" female. Just be aware. What a PITA if you don't have one handy. Otherwise, the gauge is about you'd expect from a cheap Chinese factory."
2,Lousy clamp on,"Lousy Inflator Clamp and inacurate hard to read , but good looking gauge. Lets more air out the car tire than than what goes in. I probably gave it a generous 2+ on it's good looks alone because it makes a good conversation piece. I'm a little leary about using this on bike tires."
1,Waste of money.,"Deserves NO stars. It was a complete waste of money (good thing it was so inexpensive). Could not get it to fit the valve stems on my Miata. On other tires, could not get the retaining (hands-free) clip to hold. Gauge is WAY out of calibration. Much better units are available for very little additional cost."
2,"Works, but accuracy is poor","Sad to say the pressure gauge on this is way, way off. I have to inflate my tires to an indicated 48psi to get them to the 36psi I want. That really limits the usefulness of this product.It's still nice to be able to clip it on, as it makes filling up an external air tank a lot easier than standing there shoving the filler onto the tank's fitting, but for actually filling tires to a specific pressure, it's sadly useless."
3,Expected better quality,The glass ( Plastic ) on the gauge was scratched when I received the unit .It is difficult to read
3,"Works fine, not well made...","I bought one recently to use with my racecar. It works fine (checked with a longacre for accuracy) but the dial is not properly seated in the housing, its sitting a few mm off of where its supposed to be, I can see the ""ledge"" that it should be seated against. I'm assuming that in the long run it will fail since the needle will creak since the dial is able to move around - or at least friction will prevent the needle from turning properly.I wish it was better made, the price is great, and the way it works physically, locking on the valve stem is great - just a little better quality control and I'd be happy - I'll probably buy a second one for my home garage (the 1st lives at my garage at the track) since moving it back and forth will likely shorten its life - and its cheap...but its cheap, so how can I complain too much?"
3,You get what you pay for,I ordered it because I liked that it had a dial gauge attached. I found that when using it on my car tires it did an OK job but would not engage my bicycle tires Presta valves properly even with an adapter. The pin holding the clip that you attach to the tire stem came apart right away and air started leaking at the hose/gun connection by the trigger.
2,Gauge 10 PSI off!,"Build quality is cheap, as expected. Of course, I still expected the gauge to be useful but it is not! It's almost 10 psi off. Against several other known good gauges I have this one reads high. So far my clip hasn't failed. Of course it doesn't come with the connector for the air hose - how would they know which style you have?Now I have to find a replacement gauge. Likely will have to re-tap for a larger thread, as I cannot find a replacement gauge that fits the current threads.Charge me 2$ more and use a better gauge - I'd be much happier!2 stars - since other than the gauge it works."
4,Love this and don't regret purchase. Use it often,"Glad I bought this. This is so much easier than using a separate air pressure gauge. So far, I've used it many times and had no regrets. It is worth the $15 I paid and has worked flawlessly each time.UPDATE 9/28/12 - I've noticed that the gauge on this is off and not real accurate. It is several psi off and shows pressure as higher than what some other more accurate gauges read. It is fine once you know this and know by how much but as an example, I have to fill my tires up such that this gauge reads 40 psi vs the 36 it should have so that it actually has 36 psi."
2,An Ok Book If Your Looking For Fast Facts But........,"My problem with the book ""1912 Facts About Titanic by Lee W. Merideth"" was that they had mistakes that could have easily be fixed if they read pretty much any other book on Titanic. When writing about the Allison Family she named their daughter as Helen but everyone knows her name was Loraine. A fact easy to look up in ""Titanic An Illustrated History."" Another easy mistake is when talking about J.Bruce Ismay, when he started yelling ""lower away, lower away"" is was not 4th Officer Boxhall who yelled back at him, it was 5th Officer Lowe. Again easy to look up. Another thing is Lee W. Merideth would jump ahead in the story and then jump back. Sometimes repeating a part of the same story twice. Overall it's an OK book if your looking for a Titanic Book to get the facts fast. But if you want a Great read on Titanic's History pick up ""Titanic An Illustrated History"" not only will you get the Facts but you will also see some wonderful Illustrations."
4,I liked it.,"The book was good for its logical order of listing the facts. Plus they are placed in chonological order, making it easy to find a single piece of information. The facts were consice, not drawn out with sentmentality or other things that may keep the facts 'hidden'. And that is what makes the book so likable."
3,Nice little book about Titanic,"This was a nice little book, however, I felt it repeated itself a lot with the same information over and over. In addition, there were several grammatical errors/sentence mistakes that always detracts from a read. Some of the pictures were very interesting-particularly the last picture taken of Murdoch and Lightoller before the ship left on its journey. I did learn a few new things about the Titanic."
5,Terrific for Research as well as Light Reading,"I thought this book was TERRIFIC! It was alot of fun to read. The style was casule and informative. Read it, you'll learn all you ever need to know about cockroaches. Funny, fast paced, great for a report."
5,Cockroaches,The standard paragraph and a picture approach in most encyclopedias is like the dating website of entomology and could not sate my roach fascination. If you want a very up close and personal read about our curious insectoid friends you must have this book. It is such a fun read that I'd go so far as to say if you try to read it with the lights off they would join you.
4,"Strong start, sleepy finish.....","I give this album 4 stars and not 5 becuase tracks 1-8 are sick! Then tracks 9-end slows down. If I was in a club these would be the tracks where you go to the bar, take a bathroom break or go home. Robbie Rivera has become one of my fav DJ's from his sets on Sirius. I love his hard hitting beats. The type of music that makes you pump your fist in the air (AKA guido fist pump for those in the NYC area). This CD has allot of vocals (male and female) which I like but keeps it hard at the same time (1-8). Then it just gets light and fluffy then on. I'm just glad I get a solid 8 straight songs before the CD starts to go south. Most CD's you have to keep skipping around to your fav songs. Once it gets to 9 I just start from beginging or throw in another CD. I'll pay $20 for a good 8 songs anyday. That's better than most CD's!"
1,budget rip-off,"the orange cover, 16-track cd issued in 1988 is the one to find. it only runs 47:15, but has the best track annotations of its day. forget this 1966 retread."
2,"Great concept, poor execution","This clock would be excellent, but the numbers aren't legible from some essential viewing angles. I don't seem to have this problem with other digital clocks. Instead of this being the main kitchen clock on the wall as I intended, I've put this on top of the refrigerator as a spare.Update: Both myself and a relative have had the remote temperature unit fail within 1 month. Now I only get the indoor temperature displayed on the unit."
2,remote sensor does not connect after replacing batteries,"I liked the large display, and compared to other weather clocks available at that time, this did seem to serve the clock functionality best.Purchased new, the unit worked great for a year or so. As other reviewers have noted, the setup does involve some manual button presses etc to get the remote sensor to talk to the main unit but if one follows the instructions, its OK. Also, since the remote sensor is ruggedized for outdoor use, the battery compartment and buttons all have to be accessed after removing 4 tiny screws - so make sure you have a small Phillips screwdriver handy.The problem began when I replaced batteries on the remote sensor. It no longer talks to the main unit. I placed it indoors, near the main unit, 10ft from the main unit just trying to get a connnection but no luck. The remote sensor may be broken but I have not found a seller who sells that separately. So effectively the unit is now useless..."
2,Could be better,"I have owned the Dartmouth Desk clock for 2 years, it is a real pain to reset at DLS time. This year it still is one hour late, cant get it to update. however, the wall clock:I bought an atomix wall clock a few months ago, it would not change time at DLS either. But when I reset the signal and just set the clock aside, sometime on Monday it did catch up. Note Saturday was the change over date.The temp readings are a little off, I had the 'outdoor' sender on the same shelf with the clock, the temps were 71 & 74. I noticed the temp would very by as close as 1 to as much as 6. So the temp feature is not scientifically correct, so what, it is close enough to know if you need a coat or not.Note: I also have a Sharp Atomic Clock, with the same features which has not missed a change up and is always correct.Bottom line, I thought the Desk clock may be a fluke, so got the wall clock, I should have just gotten another Sharp, you dont have to reset IT by hand."
1,Absolutely AWFUL,"Fortunately, I only invested $15 for this brand new. I should have returned it upon first time setting it up as it is quite archaic and time-consuming in its set-up procedures. Adding/replacing the batteries to the unit requires removing 4 screws."
1,not exact fit,When you sell something that says exact fit you should make sure the product is exact fit I entered all my vehicle info and it said your product would fit my year and make of vehicle exact although the floor mats are decent I wish they fit better i feel like there was some false advertising and I don't believe I got what I was told I was paying for
2,NOT CUSTOM,"The word custom is used loosely in the description for the floor liners. i have a 2011 ram 1500 and they dont fit right and i would say it is a lie that they are custom for this style of truck (eventhough it says it ""fits"" this model it does not) you are better off spending the extra and getting the actual Dodge OEM Mopar parts instead."
2,Don't Fit Well,Ordered a set for my Silverado WT and they do not fit the contours of the floor remotely. They slide around quite a bit. I bought a set of Weathertech liners for my Rav4 and they fit like a glove and are much nicer looking. The Huskys look like a warped slab of cheap plastic.
1,9.5-10 For Riding Abilities,"Unfortunately I was not able to see this DVD which I purchased as my DVD player would not accept the DVD. I understand now that DVD's produced in different areas of the world are coded differently . I am disappointed that Amazon did not indicate this in their description of the DVD. Unless you have a DVD player that is ""Region Free"" do not buy this DVD. I personally will not be buying any furthur products from Amazon."
4,Not so bald... nor even two-wigged.,"By reading the reviews right here you can notice two things:1- This is a superb early-90s prog rock band, or2- This is a shamelessly clone of an average copy from a prog rock sacred idol.In my humble opinion Arena's not one thing nor the other.Arena is a well balanced modern prog rock assemble with a strong influence from early bands. By no means they're bad musicians or performers. Their compositions are well above average for a newly formed band (by the time they released this album).The Crying for help series conform a good concept set. Jericho and Solomon are two very thoroughly assembled compositions both in music and poetry.Of course, if you're that kind of radical Genesis fan(atic) that do not accept by any means listening to another similar bell, I guarantee you'll hate it.Otherwise, just give it a chance. Listen to it, and judge for yourself."
5,Pre-John Mitchell Gem,"The singer and guitar player are gone, but this cd sets the style Clive and Mick use for their later releases. This is one of those rare finds that can play over and over, and never gets old. The masterpiece 'Solomon' has an interplay between keyboards and guitar that is breathtaking! When this song kicks in you do not want to be driving down the highway. The mixing of soft acoustic guitar with soaring lead guitar, keyboards, mellotrons playing in the backround make this my favorite Arena album, and I own everthing they have released. There is just an epic sound, to this work, with songs that build and build until you get to Solomon which is a perfect ending!"
1,An imitator of an Imitator of an....a waste of money.,"You have to be a teenager or totally new to Prog.Rock to like this shamefull band, read the other reviews and see it by yourself. Marillion the best imitator ever of Genesis is the inspiration of this band ! and Marillion next to be a proud imitator has nothing to offer. Boring and ZERO originality, get Genesis, Eloy Grobschnitt, Crimsom, Tempano, Camel, Happy the Man or any other very original band, do not waste your money."
5,This is really Hawkwind,"White Zone is a trance-ambient electronic album. If your looking for lyrics and lot's of guitar pass on this one. I like it though, great driving music. Nothing groundbreaking for the genre but has that distinct Hawkwind ambient feel to it. I'm guessing the guys were just messing around with the genre and were like "" hey that's pretty cool!, let's put it out but we won't call it a Hawkwind album."" They knew their die hard fans would find it. I did."
2,wrong discription,These vix bits are numbered 6 thru 12.. Number 12 is NOT actual #12 bit. If you are looking for #12 vix bit you have to spend $30 to $35. #12 is a commercial door hinge bit and in this set you do not get that.
5,"Hey, I actually saw the show...","I was younger then, about teenager age and I saw the promo for The Who's Tommy on the 1993 Tony Awards... granted my dad has the Who's original: it's a masterpiece.... BUT you can't judge a show's soundtrack without having seen the show... they are two very completely different things. Being an avid musical/show fan myself... Tommy is one of my favorite musicals and wish it would come back... okay, maybe some people think that the Broadway show or the recording of it butchered the Who's original Tommy but without having seen the show, no one can say that it sucks because the live music and the pure technicolor of the Broadway show is unbelievable... it is still the Who's music and how many other rock stars have (seriously) put on a rock opera on Broadway, other than Elton John, and Tommy has been big hits in Canada, Los Angeles, Germany, etc. The soundtrack is beautiful once you see the show that's when the music and the show connect, visually and mentally."
5,"A ""Sensation""!","This album is a must for any and all Who fans and broadway goers alike. The fact that it is a musical scares some but you must remember that this isn't an ordinary musical, it's THE WHO! I have seen the show and also have heard the original concept album. True they are different but only really how the music is performed and erranged. Electric guitars are more prominant in the show adding an extra punch parts were added to add to the intensity of scenes (""court room"". ""sally simpson"".) Turn the volume up and open your mind, this is a rock and roll ride that you will never forget.PS. If the show ever travels or is performed locally or even better, makes a revival in New york, I HIGHLY reccomend that you see it, hearing is only half the fun."
4,Always Good to Hear,"I'm a huge fan of The Who, and this is a great show. Of course nothing compares to The Who's own version, but to make a Broadway show out of this bizzare tale is excellent. I wish the brand new song from the show, ""I Believe My Own Eyes"", which I believe is one of the shows best songs, if not the best song, had been included and written in the Who's original album. The recording is a little muffled, and that's why I gave 4 stars, but with a great cast, and story, and of course music, it's deffinately worth listening to."
3,Not as good as the original,"Broadway, schmroadway. This is nothing more than a bastardization of a great rock n roll album. The notes are sung very prettily, the music is all in the right pitch, and people are happy at the end of the play. AS IF! To paraphrase Roger Daltrey, it's not all about singing the right note. It should be about the power and passion behind the song, to which I can only say that Roger is the only man alive who can bring Tommy to life in that way. I do like some of the music of the Broadway recording, but The Who's performance will always be superior when it comes down to it."
1,Go back to the original,"Save your money and get the original WHO version of Townshend's masterpiece. I am a BIG fan of Pete Townshend but this CD is almost laughable: a pit band that tries to sound rock ""heavy""; the overly slick production; every spect of the story is literally explained with lots of very unclever ""hit the audience over the head"" messages. Did the director really think us rock/theatre fans would like this? There is no subtext and everything is nauseatingly ""on-the-nose"" (e.g. the re-written ""let's all get along"" family ending almost makes me giggle, if it's not causing my stomache to turn.)"
2,MUCH ADO,"If you can imagine The Who's ""Tommy"" as performed by a Broadway musical cast, well then there's no surprises here. The Who's original ""Tommy"" album was a success due to it's innovative music but it's very thin storyline and simple themes of worldly gain and loss glare akwardly in this original Broadway cast recording. Peter Townsend's original work compared itself to traditional opera in that it's story was secondary, indeed only a backdrop to the music, but Broadway takies it oh so seriously with nary a drop of humility and restraint. It amounts to the sound of a loud parade passing by, in tune but colorless. For a better transition, see Ken Russell's 1975 film, ""Tommy""."
1,A big disappointment,"I don't know what the hoopla was all about; however, I didn't get to see the Broadway show. I thought they might have done something exciting with the piece, but it is very generic and old hat."
3,Maybe I should have seen this Before the Movie,"I bought this CD becuase I'm a HUGE Who fan...particularly of their rock opera ""Tommy"". As a kid in high school I saw the movie when it premiered in my hometown....I LOVED it and I rushed out and bought the movie soundtrack which I realize like this CD is not the Who. I don't dislike the staging of Tommy on Broadway. I enjoy hearing different ""takes"" on the music. This is not a CD I will listen to repeatedly. I don't think the vocals are a sStrong as the movie though i realize you had Good performances like Tina Turner and bad ones like ""Jack Nicholson"". This CD features the original cast of the Broadway revival.It's an interesting listen for fans, but not something I would recommend to Who fansor anyone who enjoyed the movie. Maybe if this was my very first listen of anythingTommy related....I'd like it more. As it is, its OK./Atreides"
2,Nice Idea But...........,"It is unfortunate that when a great rock piece is taken to Broadway that they unecessarily smooth out the rough edges and sanitise it. The rawness and the sinister quality of the original is lost in a mix of terribly done British accents, more emphasis on the tonality and pronunciation of the words than the content and subtext to have any feeling. This is a rock opera. Why not play it as one? I bought this as mere curiosity and was very disappointed. If you are a Who fan and know this show from it's original form, do not purchase this CD. It will end up being used as a coaster within a day or so as you put on the original recording and hear this masterpiece as it was meant to be."
5,Awesome,"I saw Tommy in Toronto and the music brings back that ""Sensation"" everytime. Musicians will especially enjoy the various sounds that this recording has."
4,The Who's Tommy,"I first listened to this cd on a long work day. We needed some music, so I grabbed the first cd I could find, and it just happened to be Tommy. I fell in love with it instantly. I have yet to actually see the play, but if it's half as good as the soundtrack, then it will be sensational."
3,VERY strong smell but product is effective,"We just moved to the DR and wanted a DEET alternative to the biting bugs. This product is very effective but it has a very strong, citronella smell to it. My husband uses it but I personal don't like it and have resorted to wearing clothing that covers me up or use another (DEET) product sparingly. I only use the Buzz Away when I am not going to be in a confined area or in close proximity to lots of people - to me, it's that offensive of an odor. So, if you are looking for an insect repellent without DEET that works and don't care what it smells like, this product is great."
2,"STINKY, STINKY, STINKY!!!","The only good thing is that it does not contain DEET. I'm all for natural/herbal products, but ones that don't knock you over with their smell. The only place I can stand to have this sprayed is my lower legs & feet. Any closer to my nose & it's overwhelmingly strong with its smell. YUCK!!!! Sorry, but just being honest. Just bought this product yesterday, so we'll see how it works throughout the day today. It's for my daughter who swells up when bitten by mosquitoes. So, instead of the constant spraying of OFF on her daily, we wanted to go the natural route. Guess I'll keep searching for natural but not so awful-smelling!"
5,NH thanks the buzz,"This stuff is what gets us - and our friends - through the woods and doing yardwork during mosquito season. No DEET, so OK for kids too.Good Housekeeping Institute, August 1997 'Buzz away is the most effective natural repellent tested' Tested against Avon's Skin So Soft, Bite Block and others. National Parenting Center Seal of Approval Awarded in 1999 after being field tested by families in five US cities. University of Guelph, Ontario Agricultural College Field Study: 'Buzz Away beat it's natural competitors Natrapel, Jungle Juice and Bite Blocker and tied with DEET based Skintastic for effectiveness'."
2,Works well but...,"This product seems to work well and I like that there are no harmful chemicals. However, it has a VERY strong smell that is not that pleasant."
1,awful!,This product did not work at all. My child was covered with mosquitoes bites from head to toe. Big waste of money.
1,Does Not Work!,"Coming from the biggest health nut on the planet: ""Don't get fooled! This stuff simply does not work. I got bit by a thousand mosquitos and gnats, swelled up like a balloon and was praying for some deet!"" I have to clarify that I am not happy leaving such a review as I expected a lot more from this product, and am quite disappointed."
5,Just Awesome! Still Sounds Great!,"This CD has stood the test of time. I listen to it everyday. When my students hear one of the songs, they ask ""who is that"" because they like the sound. Of course I proudly tell them. The song ""The Rock"" plays 2nd on my ipod followed by ""Over The Line"" which is from another Frankie Miller album. Frankie sings the best blues/rock ever."
3,Pictionary Edition 2,"Pictionary 2nd Edition is not has good as the first pictionary (I lost my pictionary game 1, when moving). Instructions to the game are not sufficient? We still had several questions unanswered while playing the game. Children, teenagers and adults all thought the game to not user friendly, so they got boared and didn't want to play. The word to then draw to get your team to guess were to hard and several had not even heard of that word!!!! I would not recommend the game."
5,"Great middle of the road piano, perfect for elevators","This is elevator music, however the trumpet actually plays some decent riffs(whoever it is would be better off in a legit jazz combo). Otherwise this is classy as heck elevator music. If you like Gary Clark's formless melodic piano playing you will love the piano on thsi cd. You can feel like you are at the supermarket and not even have to leave your living room."
2,Not my thing. Overly detailed.,"I was looking for a book that broadly covered lobstering. This book is very much into the people who do lobstering and how they relate to each other and to strangers and newbies.It's obviously a very detailed study if that is what you're looking for. I found it somewhat boring.I found this book much more interesting: ""The Secret Life of Lobsters: How Fishermen and Scientists Are Unraveling the Mysteries of Our Favorite Crustacean""Trevor Corson"
1,Nauseated,"These vitamins might help you lose weight, I am not sure. I couldn't stand to take them long enough to really find out. Three of my friends and I all tried these at different times and had the same results. We had to stop using them because they made us feel light headed, upset our stomachs, and made us feel like we might puke (and one of us did puke!) to various extents. We all stopped taking it within a week because we felt so sick when taking it. I did notice a decrease in my appetite before I realized why I felt sick everyday, but this was not sufficient motivation to keep me taking it. Definately try to take a few from someone else or something to see what your reaction would be to them before investing in a whole bottle for yourself."
1,Poor product quality,"As Suzanne Stambaugh wrote, our DVD player screen went blank after a few uses (it still had sound though). We were also offered a ""no-warranty"" replacement. It is ridiculous that they could sell such a shoddy product."
1,"broke easily, poor quality, nonexistent customer service","The lid (over the DVD compartment, containing the buttons and electronics) snapped off easily, due to cheap plastic hinges. The wires connecting the lid to the body became twisted, and the player would not work. Polariod customer service was unhelpful -- they said this happens ""often,"" and suggested it was our fault, that the unit had been mishandled. The cheap plastic hinges holding the lid on were a problem from day one. They said no parts were available to fix it and it was unrepairable (unit is less than one year old!). They offered a replacment for $95 plus shipping, and I can get a new one (if I wanted one) for $99. What a rip off! We will not buy another from Panasonic."
5,Great,"I really like this book. It's overview of the PC really helped me, a beginner at computers, understand many terms better. I enjoyed learning with this book and especially the CD. I really liked how the CD actually showed me how to do everything and explained everything so well."
1,Kindle version,If you need this book for a class don't get the electronic version because you WILL need the CD that is normally included with this book and the electronic versions DO NOT include it.
1,Useful if really needed,I had to buy this textbook for a class. If you really want to learn more about computers this book would be useful. If you pretty much already know your way around a computer it's not worth buying.
3,Heaven on the hammock... when it works!,"My husband initially loved this product but the clip is a challenge. There is a design flaw with this clip that holds the pulley to the spike. It showed rust after 3 weeks and frayed the rope after a couple weeks of use which ended up breaking the rope altogether. We ended up going to a boating supply store to buy a new nylon rope to replace the cotton rope from this kit. Its a great idea and when it works, its like heaven on the hammock!"
1,Missing parts,"I received my box today. Unfortunately, the package contains only 2 of the 3 items noted on the slip and shown in the picture...the rope with handle and the stick were there...but no pulley. So, I guess I'm just pretty much screwed here. I thought when I bought this item it would at least contain what I thought I purchased."
2,Not Worth for the Money,"I am managing Exchange Servert 5.5 and I brought different publications books to solve my day to day problems and managing the exchange environment properly. I did not see this book is giving any kind of exchange Secrets, they just covering lot of unnecessary stuff."
1,Not practical,"I admit to being new to Exchange, so if you're from the same background maybe you'll have the same problems. I found no practical/hands-on advice on installing or configuring Exchange Server. Most of the info seemed to be broad descriptions of features, or just descriptions of the various dialog boxes you might encounter in Exchange. There are no 1-2-3 recipes/procedures for doing many basic tasks. Among the things I could not figure out how to do using this book: installing Exchange Server, configuring Outlook to use Exchange, getting POP3/SMTP services running, using anti-spam features in Exchange, setting up Outlook Web Access... The list goes on and on. I'm not sure who this book is aimed at, but it definitely wasn't me."
1,Nearly useless,"Where do I even begin? First off, there was no flow to this book. Sometimes when a book has multiple authors the chapters don't fit together perfectly; in this book the paragraphs seemed slammed together in a random fashion. Secondly, they bounce between high-level overviews and details with nothing in between. Uggh, plus many technical inaccuracies -- very, very disappointing."
2,no secrets here,This book was of no use to me and really says the same thing that every book on Exchange does. It never touched on the Outlook web access other than half a page and nothing was relevent. Save yor money
4,Every Day with Rachael Ray Magazine,"I have just received my second magazine. I was not impressed with the first May magazine. The June/July magazine I have absolutely enjoyed. Great practical ideas/meals/recipes to use for everyday. I like that most of the ingredients are ones I already have or have used. I like the ""This Month's Menu"". It is a small tearout booklet that is easy to read. It includes a shopping list. I love that the recipes each come with a beautiful full color picture of what the meal/recipe is to look like. Thanks for a great magazine that inspires me to cook."
3,format,didnt like the format overall...seemed like alot of ads but there isnt...its just how the mag is set up...too many thumbnail pics that are hard to see!
5,Love her!,"I have not received my magazine subscriptions yet in the mail, but I still purchase them until I get it started. I love this magazine!What i love most is that the recipes are in FULL color so I know when i screw them up, I have almost 95% of the ingredients she lists already AND they are for real people. Meaning they are not the ""lite"" recipes they are the real people food!"
2,"Good thing the price was cheap, because magazine was disappointing.","I got a subscription to this magazine for $5, which was a good thing because I was disappointed with this magazine. I was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so I am always on the lookout for good recipes that I can prepare and eat without messing up my diet. I had heard good things about the Everyday with Rachael Ray magazine, so when I found this great price I decided to try it. I loved the general setup of the magazine, but was disappointed that the recipes didn't show any nutritional information. How am I supposed to know if the dishes are diabetic-diet friendly, if there is no nutritional information available? I already received a renewal bill, but I won't be renewing the magazine unless I see some improvement in the next couple of months."
1,A magazine for people who don't eally cook,"I hate to be the spoiler here but I have yet to find a decent recipe in either her magazine or any of her books. I think her recipe ""lingo"" is really annoying and condescending (""just eyeball it"") and her food is pedestrian and bland. The magazine itself is pretty to look at, well edited, and some of the features are interesting. But if you're looking for great food, subscribe to Bon Appetit or Food & Wine. I think this is aimed toward fans of her show and her ""tries-to-hard-to-be-cute"" banter. Too bad Oprah didn't want to promote Giada or Ina instead."
2,Administrative Problem,Took 5 months to receive 1st issue. There are much better cooking mags available. I enjoy her TV shows and am a general fan of Rachael but can not recommend a subscription to this publication.
3,The magazine is OK- Publisher's policies misleading,"I enjoy this magazine, but it is alittle too much ""Rach."" What I am really bothered by is the publisher changing expiration date at will. My subscription has always had a Feb. expiration, yesterday I received the Nov. issue. The issue is alittle thicker than normal, but is not labeled ""Special"" or ""Double."" I noticed that my expiration date had randomly changed to Dec. I contacted the publisher through Amazon (whose service has alway be excellent. I received an e-mail from publisher's customer service stating my Nov. issue was so special they decided to count it as two. I feel these ""Special"" issues should be anticipated in advance- subscriber's expiration dates should be considered almost a contract, I don't feel it was fair to rchange expiraton anytime the publisher chooses. I will not renew subscription, and will avoid Reader's Digest publications."
2,Letting my subscription lapse...,"I've subscribed to this magazine for several years, and I admire Rachels' perkiness and I do enjoy some of the articles. The problem I have is none of the recipes really appeal to me. Either they are strange, example: ""Elvis Styled Grilled Banana Sundaes"" or just not appealing ""Salami, White Bean and Water Cress Crostini."" She focuses a lot on pasta dishes, dishes with tomato, appetizers which are fine, but not tempting, and I don't find they have as much family appeal. The non-holiday months are fairly generic, although I admit I do like the Fall and December issues.There are also articles that focus on clothing, travel and the psychology of shopping.I would suggest buying a few issues and seeing if her style and tastes are yours."
3,"I hate to admit it, but...","Against my better judgment, I picked up an issue of this magazine at my local bookstore one day and decided to flip through it. I hate to admit it, but as much as Rachael Ray annoys me (I used to love her on $40-a-Day, but what happened?!), I have to say that I was pretty impressed.I enjoyed how there were many different aspects to the magazine besides just food. And trust me, she's much less obnoxious when you don't have to listen to her!"
3,Bad news....no nutritional info for any recipe,"This magazine is slick.....great recipes, wonderful photo's, useful tips. The bad news is that they consciously choose not to put any nutritional information in for any of their recipes. I do not cook anything that I don't know the nutritional info for......maybe a bit health-nutty, but I try to watch what I eat and altho her recipes looked great, I never made one dish from the magazine. I find it ironic that people have brought this to the magazine's attention and they still choose to lose readers rather than change.I am not renewing my subscription for this reason alone."
1,Cancelled with out any notice,"I have this as a gift for Christmas. The person received one issue but nothing after. I contacted amazon and the rep stated:""I contacted the publisher and they informed me that this subscription was canceled on Dec 6, 2011 directly through them. They were unable to provide any further details to me on this cancellation.""I nor the recipient requested to cancel."
1,Don't plan on a fulll year : (,"I subscribed last May for 12 issues. When the November issue was about to arrive, they notified you that it was going to count as 2 issues because it had just over 40 more pages. Does that equal a whole magazine? It still did not have as many pages as Real Simple or Better Homes & Garden! I paid for 12 issues, not 11 1/4...I am NOT happy.Every other page is an ad and most of the recipes are some form of pasta. Enough already! Needless to say, I will not be renewing."
3,Everyday.....,"A fun magazine to read through but for me, the recipes would be a stretch. I just didn't find a lot of recipes that would work for my family.Lots of good ideas but it isn't for everyone."
5,best performance shop online,i bought 2 items from powerhorse freaks i found that the prople are really usefluu and they have the best customer care.i really recomend them and there shipment is always on time even ahead. thank you and i really recomend this company.
2,Weak,"Whats the big deal? This album is extremely overrated! Probably their second worst next to ST Anger.Here are my rating for the songs....Battery- Few good riffs but boring opening and silly lyrics. 2/10Master of Puppets- WTF!!!!! 0/10The Thing That Should Not Be- Too slow and boring, okay solo. 3/10Sanitarium- Extremely boring song. 1/10Disposable Heroes- The best song here but still one of the worst Metallica songs ever, way too long and boring riffs. 4/10Leper Messiah- *Yawn*. 1/10Orion- Way too long and boring instrumental, good basslines. 3/10Damaga Inc- They must have a song worse than the title track???? Very silly lyrics. -1/10"
2,Supremaly Overrated Junk,"This is the album that Metallica finally began to run out of Mustaine riffs. Good thing they showed their true colors after And Justice for All, first a corporate radio rock band, and then a corporate radio country band.If you absolutely must listen to this group, get the No Life 'Til Leather demo. This bands only redeeming quality was kicking Dave Mustaine out, allowing for the creation of the greatest thrash/speed metal band ever, Megadeth.Oh yeah, and Cliff Burton *ucked."
1,metallica is overrated crap,"I used to like this album when i was maybe 11 or 12 years old and didn't know much about heavy metal. i used to think this band was acctauly good, but then as i got a little older i started listen bands like black sabbath, judas preist, iron maiden, accept,ect and found out just how juvinile metallica and their songwritting was, and basically forgot all about this band and it's over-rated fame. what is the hype behind metallica/master of puppets? this is amature garage metal at best when you compare it to real heavy-metal, for god sake, if you are thinking about buying this, just go up to the box in the top left and type ""powerslave"" or ""defenders of the faith"" and get a real heavy-metal experience,not this overrated trash."
2,step up,"crap don't buy buy green day,hendrix,sum41,yellowcard,hoobastank,maroon5,good charlotte,guns n roses, taking back sunday,dashboard confessonal,or breaking benjamin."
1,overrated as hell,"I find it pretty funny how there are so many people who say how awesome ""master of puppets"" w/ out realizing how overblown and overrated it is. its one thing to like an album, but to just spoil it w/ undeserved credit like this is nausiating. metalrules.com called this the all time greatest heavy metal album ever, IT'S NOT! it doesent even deserve to be in the top 50. the greatest metal album ever would be ""sad wings of destiny"" from judas preist, not this pile of garbage from amature musicians."
1,what is wrong with the guy below me?,"First off, ""Appetite for destruction"" isn't metal, despite what MTV will tell you,now, on to the album.this isn't even close to being the greatest metal album of all time, i mean, on it's own its fine and not bad at all, but if you compare it to any real metal of the era when MOP came out (not hair metal mind you) like mercyful fate, iron maiden, accept, manowar,ect. MOP would be crushed. its stupid how MOP gets all this hype when its average at best.sure, all of you metallica fans can wax it with all of the praise you want to make yourself like it that much, but it sucks big time when compared to real metal. this album was hyped up about as much as y2k,you will find better metal out there then this, go get savatage's ""dungeons are calling"" for some real metal."
1,THERE ARE TOO MANY OBSESSED W/ THIS ALBUM,"master of puppets ain't all that great, it is possible that its one of the most overrated albums of our time. the reason i say this is because there are so many albums that would grind this to dust, like slayers ""reing in blood"" iron maidens""powerslave""accepts""balls to the wall"",ect, get over this guys, its alright by itself, but its nothing compared to real metal,get into real metal and not teenage garage band metal like this.P.S. what is all of the hype behind cliff burton? how is he in any way a bass god like every one claimes him to be? his bass lines were easy as hell! i don't get it, this fool was a o.k. bassist, but by no means a master, steve haris could have buried this clown."
5,"Scrape the money together... (beg, borrow, steal)","First - I won't make fun of you because you don't own this. (or at least I'll try real hard) because that would make me a music snob. I love great music, and I like to share it with others....... after the monumental drop Metallica has taken in the last ten years it's easy to forget how increadible they were (still are live). Metallica changed my life, and I can never make up my mind which album is my favorite, this one or Ride the Lightning, but if any album should be called the masterpiece of music it is Master of Puppets. If you can listen to Orion without getting chills (after so many years,I still can't get over the bass solo towards the end) well then you are not man enough to watch Braveheart, therefore you are banished from my presence.Enjoy your life!p.s. this album will make it better!!!"
5,"The Best, Ever","Master of Puppets is more than just Metallica's best CD, its probably one of the best that Ive ever heard. It has intense lyrics which slap the faces of little rap-rock bands who sing about their whinney problems, and also the most kickass guitar playing ever. You too will think that Kirk Hammet is a god after hearing this CD.The best thing about Master of Puppets is that its more than just some drink-coaster metal disc. If you like any sort of hard rock, Master of Puppets is a great buy. Why spend your money on a pop cd when you can buy some METALLICA? sure they sound a whole lot different in the 80s then they do now, but seriously... you need this cd. Everyone needs this cd."
5,The Soul of Metal,"I think Metallica must have visited the same crossroads at midnight where Blues Artists Robert Johnson claimed he sold his soul to the Devil so he could play guitar. This is how the Gods intended heavy metal to sound. There is not a single mundane or boring note in the entire album. Kirk Hammet and James Hetfield are the greatest guitar duo in metal ever, period. I have not heard such mind blowing and just plain enjoyable guitar licks and solo's in metal as i have in Puppets. Bassist Cliff Burton adds a whole nother dimension to the already rich sound Kirk and James produce, which just seems to be lacking in later albums like Justice and Black. The 80s produced many good thrash acts, Megadeth, Testament, Slayer, but none came close to making something like this. One of the other reviewers said it best, classical music played by a heavy metal band."
5,As good as they say.,"Most of the songs are top-notch, some of their best and highest-energy material. Disposable Heroes started to sound cheezy after a few listens, and Orion became boring. Other than those, I can listen to this over and over, and still get a rush.The production is the best. All the playing is crisp and full, like it's right in front of you.Well worth the investment, even though the band makes money off you...unless you buy a used copy.Songwriting: 9/10Musicianship: 10/10Sound Quality: 10/10Originality: 10/10"
5,This has got to be one of the best,"This is one of the greatest cds ever there is never a dull moment. The cd starts out with Battery, the begining sounds like some spanish guitar melodys that makes you think that Amazon sent you the wrong cd somehow the BAM! It turns into a 200 mile bang with the guitars and drums coming in at the same time. Master of Puppets is one the best songs on the cd (It's about drug addiction). The Thing Should Not Be is the worst track but is still pretty awesome. Sanitarium is awesome (from the point-of-view of a mentally ill) Disposable Heroes is a really powerful song about war. Leper Messiah is another good track. Orion shows that this guys know how to do more than rip up guitars. And ends with Damage Inc another great song"
5,BEST LP PUT TOGETHER BY THIS BAND,IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT CREAM DOES RISE TO THE TOP. GIVEN THE BAND THAT COULD REDO A BLUEGRASS SONG AND TURN IT INTO A #1 CHART TOPPING HIT. WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM SOME OF THE BANDS BEST WORK IT SHOULD BE PUT IN GOLD. PRESERVE IT FOR MY SON AND OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET THIER ROCKS OFF ON.
5,Metallica's Best Album By Far!!!,"This is the album where Metallica found it's place in the heavy metal world. The lightning fast riffs of ""Battery"", to the instrumental power ballad of ""Orion"", every track on this album has a distiguishing quality that pushes the realm of heavy metal to all time highs. If you only get one Metallica album, make it ""Master of Puppets"". And while your at it, buy an industrial strength neck brace, your going to need it after a listening of this album."
5,A heavy metal masterpiece,Musically and lyrically Metallica can addict the listener with this work. 3 out of 8 songs extend over 8 minutes yet hardly become tiresome. Definitely THE album to buy.
5,The Greatest Heavy Metal album of all time,"Crunching, grinding, screaming, powerful - all words to describe this, the greatest of all heavy metal albums. Bridging the gap between the pop/glam rock of Bon-Jovi and the metal mayhem of Slayer, 'Master' put Metallica on the map. And like Black Sabbath, Van Halen, and the Beatles, defined and influenced future generations of musicians. The layered guitars provided a never before heard wall of 'crunch'. The music varies between melodical power rhythms(Leper Messiah, Orion), lightning fast solos(Damage, Inc., Master), to all-out metal blitz (Battery, Damage Inc.) Hetfield's lyrics are one of the things that sets this album apart from it's counterparts. Thoughtful, literary (The Thing that Should Not Be), and powerful, 'Master' offered an intelligent departure from the screaming, unintelligble speed songs that had become popular at the time. Often imitated, but never duplicated - even by the band itself - this is THE definitive heavy metal disc."
5,One of the best ever.,"This is Metallica at its finest. Simply put, I already knew of the amazing songs on this CD. But I had never purchased it. It was only 10$ So why not? This truly is one of my favorite metal CDs of all time. All 8 songs are classic. This came out in 1986..think about it, for its time its even more incredible. Pick this one up. You wont regret it."
5,Classic!!!,"Excelent work by Metallica. Everything is fine in this album: the concep, the artcover, the lyrics, the songs, the guitar solos and, of course, Cliff. Fav tracks: Sanitarium, Master of Puppets and Orion. Buy it and remember the good old Metallica."
5,loud with subtleties,"This is Metallica's best album, and likely the best album in heavy metal history. It manages to retain much of the hard, heavy edge of Kill 'em All and Ride the Lightning, while adding in more subtle, distortion-free guitar riffs. These give pieces of the album, for example the introduction to ""Battery,"" an epic sound. One that leaves you awestruck. It has the magnitude of an orchestra, with the sharp heavy volume of metal. This album has plenty of the loud, strong, raw anger for which Metallica is known, in songs such as Leper Messiah, while still showcasing Metallica's quieter, yet somehow more disturbing side in songs like Sanitarium. This album is at times scary, such as in ""Thing That Should not Be,"" at times angry, even at times quiet. In the intro to Battery, and in the instrumental Orion, it showcases Metallica's epic sound. This was Cliff Burton's farewell, and he proved himself deserving of the legendary status he has achieved."
4,Awesome,"This is an awesome CD. Not as good as Ride the Lightning, though. Here's the songs:Battery: probably the fastest song on the CD with awesome bass and a cool middle sectionMaster of Puppets: a true classic. But many people don't realize that it's acually a sonata that follows ABA format with a fast start, slow section, then a finale similar to the first movement.Thing that should not be: A very catchy song with a awesome, weird soloSanitarium: a good song with some funny lyrics if you listen to themDisposible Heroes: awesome song about warLeper Messiah: pretty goodOrion: an instrumental, not as good as call of ktuluDamage, INC.: about as fast as battery. This is a cool song with an awesome riftThis is a must own for anyone who likes plain old good rock."
5,I Am A New Metallica Fan,"I am a new Metallica fan who just started listening to Metallica's music. I heard the song ''The Unforgiven II'' on the radio and I loved it, so it led me to buy the album ''Reload''. I thought that it was an awesome album. I loved all the songs on it. Then I bought the album ''Master Of Puppets'' because I heard it was Metallica's best. I have to say that this album is outstanding. I don't own all the albums yet but this is the best collection of heavy metal I have ever heard. There is only 8 songs but it is over an hour of great heavy metal music with not one boring moment. This album is much better than Reload but all of Metallica's songs that I have heard so far are great. I am a new Metallifan but I know that this is some of the greatest music I have ever heard. ROCK ON METALLICA!"
5,the best thrash metal album,This Japanese Imported Metallica album proves the fame and influence it has reached worldwide. Master of Puppet is inarguably one of the best metal albums ever released by a band. The Japanese version actually has a better audio quality if you listen carefully. It is also a great collector's item if you're a die hard metallica fan and an audiophile.
4,Vinyl version is garbage!,"I was excited to pick up a copy of this for a good price from a local music store only to take it home, open it up, and listen to it and find out that it was pressed like crap. Right out of the wrappping the record skipped all over the place, my guess is it was produced poorly, and i have super dirty, old records that don't even do this. An amazing album of course, but if you want it on vinyl i would stick to the original pressing."
1,I didn't see what the big deal was.,Why is this album highly praised? Was it becuase the movie OLD SCHOOL had it in the background? maybe so.Metallica sucks. The only decent albums they have are load and reload and their masterpiece ST anger. Their first 5 albums are really bad.
1,Boring...,"This CD is quite possibly THE most overrated album of all time. There is so many songs on this CD that just drag on for far too long and the song writing isnt strong enough to hold my interest. They try to make each song an epic but they fail terribly to do so in the process. What this band does manage to do though is create very boring generic thrash that just makes you tired. While listening to this CD...maybe they'll have an interesting riff but once that riff emerges...the band beats it into the ground until you're sick of it. Metallica does not feature strong song writers and the only good thing that they managed to do in their career is make thrash popular so more of the music was created (and better at that). Oh, I also can handle long songs because I like Opeth and they create long song structures."
1,You guys are gay metallica,this is just sloppy messy misic and if you lke that kind of feeling when you think your cool and blast this loser CD and roll down your windows in your big truck. this is just bad it makes me want to kill little bunnies and worrship statan. The lyrics are dumb and sometimes dont make any sense and there. There is some good guitar but hey its so much over rated. This used to be one of my favorite but now I realize that they are just another 80s metal band nothing special.
1,A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY IF YOU LIKE THE NEW METALLICA!,I bought the black album and I totally loved it. Then after that I bought S&M another good one. On S&M I loved all the songs from master of puppets so i bought the cd master of puppets. I totally hated it. The only single song I kind of liked just a tiny bit was battery and that song gets old. i strongly recomend you DO NOT bye this cd if you have listened to the newer metallica!
1,another classic in the world of wanna be metal,"I can't stress how bad this band is. Particularly their drummer and singer. They think they are like the best at what they do when they really ... James Hetfield's style of singing is annoying, talentless, and shows his cocky attitude. And he acts like he's like a heavy metal god when the band isn't even heavy....or metal. One interview in a magazine will show this. Same with Lars, the drummer. He's not good at all. Kirk is a good guitarist but not good enough to be compared to the likes of Dimebag Darrell, or any other great guitar legend. This band may have been better back when this album was released but it's still Metallica and it still sucks. And to think that they are compared to the likes of Pantera or Slayer! This is music for those metal wannabe's who think they're cool because they ride a Harley and don't take showers."
1,THEY WERE SOO MUCH BETTER ON ST. ANGER!!,"why have solos? they just drag on the song. all thrash metal sucks. only NU metal is awesome, like linkin park or simple plan. i hate master of puppets! it is soooo overrated!!!"
1,Thrash metal? More like TRASH metal! Get St. Anger instead.,"I don't know why people think this is Metallica's greatest album! It's the same riff over and over and over and over, and I have not even seen a MOP music video on MTV. Like seriously, where's the variety, like in St. Anger?So I say to avoid this album at all costs and get St. Anger. Load and Reload are awesome as well, and if St. Anger is too badazz for you, get those two first to prepare for the ANGER!!!"
1,Do NOT BUY THIS,"THIS IS ABSOLUTLEY AWFUL. IT ALL SOUNDS EXACTLY THE SAME. IF YOU BUY THIS, YOU MUST BE COMPLETELY FOOLISH, BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF FLUSHING YOUR MONEY DOWN THE BOG. ONLY BRAIN-DEAD TOWNIES WITH NO INTELLIGENECE HIGHER THE 15iq SHOULD BUY THIS. IT IS TOTALLY GARBAGE."
5,probably their best album.,"this is another awesome pre sellout album. not a bad song on the album. from the pure speed and aggression of battery to the roller coaster ride called orion, puppets is an amazing album."
5,The best heavy-metal album of history,"This is the best album I've ever heard!!! From Battery to Damage Inc., there are only excellent songs. When I first heard it, I couldn't believe how good the CD was. In my opinion, this album contains the 2 best songs from Metallica: ""Welcome Home (Sanitarium)"" and ""Master of puppets""."
1,Vinyl was scratched twice!!,I'm a huge 80's hard rock and heavy metal fan. I love the metallica albums and master of puppets is one of my favorites. If you want my advice tho. DON'T BUY THE VINYL!!!!. It was damaged twice. My 1st copy came all scratched and i wanted a replacement. I just got it today and the replacement was scratched also!!!. i em very unhappy with the fact i got two damaged copies.
4,Excellent,"I like this album, because it's full of ideas. I like the guitarist, and bassist. Here's a lot of noise, and I like noise.Lars Ulrich is a great drummer, but himself, he's crazy. I really recommend to buy this album. The vocals is unique !!! Metallica is a great band. And no band plays like these guys do.The best song is Welcome Home (Sanitarium).BUY !!! BUY !!! BUY !!!"
5,real metal,"Master of puppets is a great heavy album. The opening song, Battery is fast paced and a good energizing song. The title song, Master of Puppets is one of the best but it leaves room for improvement (fortunatly they fixed it on S&M). This album is not as melodic as some of their newer stuff but it's true heavy metal, unlike Papa Roach or some of the other ... nu-metal bands that have unfortunatly made it big today."
5,There are no equals!,"Words just cannot do this artistry justice. When considering much of what Metallica produce now, this is of Olympus standards. An album with a golden glow that makes us realise just how good Metallica could be if they did what they do best. There are many people out there who wonder, no, pray that one day Metallica would sease the endless sell out and return to past and what could be future glories. This album is testament to their greatness. There is not a bad track, never a moment where you cannot be bothered to listen. The crushing power and sheer exitement of this work just steam rollers onwards.Surfice to say, Metallica are STILL a great band, BUT only when you look at their past achievements. Their latest material can't even touch this, be uttered within the same breath. Put simply: If you were going to buy any Metallica album, it would HAVE to be this one. In some instances, if you had to buy any metal album generally, it would HAVE to be this. Sheer genius."
1,Save your money. These reissued LP's are made with flawed presses.,"Out of all the reissues the only lp's that work for me are kill em all which is probly the only one worth getting it sounds better than the rest. Ride the lightning plays ok, but doesn't sound any near as good as the cd and the cd is miles away from sounding as good as the original lp. Puppets is the worst of all of em. I tried multiple copys on multiple players with differnt stylus. You would be better off getting original lp's anyway cuz these reissues are very dull n lifeless when compared. I sent my reisses back n amazon was good about the refund."
1,Never Saw the Big Deal,"New Metallica, old Metallica, both are worthless artifacts from their respective time periods. Always sounding like the gay Slayer, Metallica's only decent purpose in my eyes was for good bands to be able to cover their second rate attempts at thrash. My theory? Anyone who owns a Metallica shirt has an I.Q. below 65."
1,Music? What music?,"Music? This is not music. It's only the usual poor metal stuff, just like all the other metal rubbish. If you bang your head against the wall you obtain the same frantic chaos inside you. Useless and dangerous, without any porpouse, any importance, any difference from...nothingness. So, make yourself and your health a favour and buy something else, something lightfull and joyfull. Something to feel, to think, to remember. Anything else, but metal."
1,Orion is the only good song.,"Master of Puppets is a really overrated album, which I don't like music that just seems the same. I've bought a lot of Metallica CDs and thought, these guys are overrated, I mean James Hetfield can't sing, he just screams. He's not anything like Mark Knopfler, or Lou Gramm. Anyway, to this album, well, I thought this was a really annoying album, the title track is just nothing but screaming. Orion is about the only decent song off the whole CD. Rest of the other songs deserves zero stars. Metallica only made about 5 decent tracks, 4 of the others are off the Black Album. Listen to those 5 and stop messin' around with Metallica's lame songs. I will never forget Lars Ulrich, I like Metallica because he's a great drummer(one of the best drummers period!).I'll give this 1 star because Orion rocks!! Rest of the other songs are crappy.......Buy this and the Black Album and avoid all the other CDs from Metallica. Thanks,Brothers in Arms."
1,METALLICA SUCKS HORRIBLE,"I don't like heavy metal. And this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard as Metallica only made 1 decent song in EnterSandman. Rest of their music sucks. Get Nirvana Nevermind instedor even better FOREIGNER 4.Believe me, I knowWhirligig."
5,METALLICA'S BEST,"This album will kill all of the damn posers out there, because it is too heavy for them, well so what. overall, this Metallica's best and heaviest album along with Ride The Lightning. So if you dont have it, go get it, or youre a poser."
1,What a disapointment,"After reading all of the glowing reviews of this LP I was very excited to get a copy. I have to say that I was completely disapointed. At first, I thought the turntable or phono pre amp had a problem. But when I listened to another LP, it sounded great. This isn't like when you see a movie that has great reviews and it doesn't live up to the hype, it is worse then that. This is, simply put, a very bad sounding LP.When I compared it to the CD remastered in 1999, the CD just blew it away. Given the extent to which this album was made there is no reason for this. I cannot understand how anyone can think that this sounds good in ANY way. It is always possible that I received a bad copy or the 100,000 press but I don't think that's it.Save your money, buy the CD."
5,METALLICA IS THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD,This is by far Metallica's best cd ever. Just about every song on the cd kicks a**. Anyone who is reading this review and does not have the cd should buy it now.
4,Great Album,"This album is one of Metallica's best. It shows the pure talent of every member of the band.As you listen to it, you can hear the potential that Metallica had in the mid-80's. It's just the beginning of what Metallica was turning into. Today they are one of the biggest bands in the world."
5,best metallica i have,"This Metallica album has everything. even though no song is under 5 minutes, they keep it cool with huge guitar solos that keep you listening. they could have put more songs on the album because ive listened to it so many times and each time i finish it really fast. anyways all the songs kick ass (except for number 7 ""orion"" the instrumental). in order from best to worst i would have to say welcome home (sanitarium), leper messiah, master of puppets, the thing that should not be, disposable heroes, battery, damage inc., and orion. DONT PASS ON THIS ALBUM if u just have st. anger and u like it, this is much better you wont regret this buy."
2,Master of Puppets [Vinyl],Received the product with delay. This vinyl seems not remastered in the proper way. It does not sound as expected.
2,Master of puppets 2lp,"I've bought the Master of puppets lp from amazon.The package skould be changed so if you buy one lp it sholud be snuggly fitted inside the package not as this one was, falling around in a big box.But when it comes to the record itself i find that MoFi has done a little poor job when mixing up the record. This can also be said with kill en all and ride the lightning that the tweeter is much to high. The record sounds great but the tweeter levels are just to damn loud it cuts to the ears and sounds really bad after a while.Damn you MoFi..."
3,good but not that good,"I expected so much but was left disappointed. This is a good album but if u wanna experience true metal at amazing speed then there is really only one album to buy, MEGADETH'S RUST IN PEACE. Thats all i have to say ;)"
2,Orion is the only good song.,"I detest all the other songs on Master of Puppets other than Orion. Orion was the best song I heard on this, very instrumentalwhich ROCKS!! It's also one of my top songs these days. Listento this album only for Orion and get this with the Black Album today."
4,A GOOD METALLICA ALBUM.,"THIS MAY NOT BE MY FAVOURITE METALLICA ALBUM, BUT I LIKE IT ALONG WITH RIDE THE LIGHTNING, AND THE GREAT BLACK ALBUM. THIS IS DEFINATELY BETTER THAN CRAPPY BANDS OF AC/DC, ROLLING STONES, LED ZEPPELIN, PINK FLOYD, AND THE BEATLES AND HAS TERRIFIC SONGS LIKE BATTERY AND ORION. SOMEONE GIVE ME THE LP VERSION OF THIS ALBUM????"
2,no!,this album was made for the highest! the riffs are quite good but the lyrics are terrible! i recommend you to seek for slayer and led zeppelin!
5,the best,"Some people think load and reload are good, but they haven't heard of master of puppets probably. This their best album and hardest ever."
5,It's good... maybe the best,"If you like good heavy metal music, this is THE cd for you. It shows the good times of Metallica, when they had CLiff Burton. I guess this is the best one of all times for them."
4,hard-core Metallica... but not the best they've done,"Though people tend to say Master of Puppets is the greatest of Metallica's earlier works, it seems a bit too commercially driven to me. That is not to say it is not hard, intense, and fast--all Metallica is wonderful work, and this is no exception. Still, Ride the Lightning felt fresher, more innovative."
5,nothing else matters,this is my favorite song from all the metallica songs! this song is driving me nuts! it's the best song from all the songs in the history! i love METALLICA! METALLICA! the best band ever to have conquered mankinds outside world and MUSIC!
4,Very good album!,"A must have for your collection. However, if you want a true 5 star album, i'd go with Reign in Blood by Slayer. That album blows this one away in every category."
5,Master Of Puppets possibly the best,"But dont take my word for it. Buy it yourself and see,also take the hundreds of other positive reviews words for it."
5,"A Classic, what else can I say ?",If you like Metallica then you will like this album. If you have heard one of the songs off this album and like it then you will like this album. All in all this a great metal record. It is very consistant and should please you most of the way through (if not all the way through). An essential for any fan of Metallica or newcomer. One of the greatest thrash metal albums ever.
5,Master of metal,"This is one of thee best heavy metal albums of all time. The riffs by james hetfield and the killer solos by kirk hammett are mind blowing. i love the whole album all the way through but i have to say master of puppets is my favorite song on the album. Master of puppets,rust in peace,and reign in blood are among my favorite metal albums of all time."
5,this is just the best album ever,"This album created, defined, and inspired all metal and brought it from the underground to mainstage.This album is a peice of heavy,yet mellow peice of brilliance in which Metallica had beutiful melodies(welcome home) and thrashing speed explotions (battery).This album also showed perticully good drums by lars, amazing lead guitar by kirk, brilliant vocals by james, and undeniable bass work by cliff(R.I.P.).Metallica made a spark in 1983 that no noe was gonna deny would become huge...and it did.Metallica basically sculpted out the entire blue print for the heavy metal and speed/thrash metal world that came in the next 5 years or so,but they most likely didn't know what they had created in general.At the least, Metallica opened the door to the entire metal world for generations until and generations in the future."
5,METALLICA RULES,This CD rules. Every track on it is awesome. If you are just getting into metallica buy this CD.
5,The best Metallica album ever!!,"Master Of Puppets (the last album with their late bassist Cliff Burton) is arguably Metallica's best album ever. Kirk Hammett's lightning fast guitar solos, Cliff's roaring bass, Lars Ulrich's in your face drum work, and James Hetfield's vocals just kill for me. Battery, Master Of Puppets, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Disposable Heroes, and Damage Inc. are the best songs. A must have for true Metallica fans. Rest In Peace Cliff my friend."
4,"Great, but not ""Justice""","Many people will agree that this is Metallica's best album, but it's more like ""one of their best."" But I like how it has power chords and the songs have no filler, whatsoever. This is still going to be in the shelves of many peoples' ""classics"" collection of metal albums. However, it's hard to describe since it's so darn good."
5,The is THE MASTER OF ALBUMS,"This CD kicks arse! I cant believe those stupid retards that go on about how bad this CD is. its so wicked, the riffs, lyrics, drums are all awesome, i cudnt believe it, This is the best of cliff burton, too bad he didnt make another Pulling Teeth, but he still shone brilliantly here, i loved him, Lars pounded the drums with all his SkillHammet did a terrific job and shud've got an award, i loved this album and u gotta buy it if u like metal, if u dont like this album then u shud go back to ur pansy Limp BizkitBattery-10/10-Master of Puppets-10/10Thing that shudn;t b- 9.5/10Sanitarium-8/10Dispoable Heroes-8/10Leper Messiah-10/10Orion-10/10Damage Inc.-10/10"
5,Greatness (better than 5 stars),"If you were to compile a list of the ""Top 10 CDs That Changed The Face Of Music"", this would be on that list. This CD is greatness. Plain and simple greatness. Words fail to describe the importance of this CD. Forget the other reviewers. Just buy and see for yourself."
1,The Most Over rated CD in the world...,"I can't believe why everyone think that this album is their best or is flawless. It totally sucks and the only good thing about it is the song Battery. All the rest of the songs suck especially Damage Inc. I say that you shouldnt get this. Just save up that money and buy some other band's music. I think that instead of buying this, you should get Slipknot's Subliminal Verses Vol. 3 it makes this album digraceful."
1,No.,"I believe that in this day and age, the term 'genius' is being used far too loosely. Since when did this apply to 4 would-be-mechanics, whose main artistic feat thus far is breaking the record for smallest pair of pants squeezed into, and most horse-like haircut? I am appalled. I haven't even touched on the 'music' yet.The 'music'? Well, if you believe that many painful minutes of buzzsaw guitars combined with a drummer, adding unnecessary fills to satisfy his vanity, combined with the monotonous roar of...a...horse in pain (or so it seems), is genius, well then YOU need to look in the mirror...and ask.....why... do I look just like my idols?Nay!It gets a star for the front cover. One common destiny. Noted."
1,This CD is about as useful as crap on a spoon.,"I used to like Metallica. But now that me and my friends talk black and listen to HIP-HOP I (now)realize how lame I used to be! If you wanna hear REAL music go and get the new PUFF DADDY. Peace, homies!"
2,Save your money and get MOP original vinyl or CD,"I have compared the re-maser vinyl of MOP to an original, and was pretty shocked by what i found. The MOP vinyl remaster does not have that nice warm sound the original MOP vinyl does. Also the drums are barely audible at times in the songs. The symbols are also further back in the mix. If you are on a budget or want the best sound for your money. Go with getting the MOP 2000 remaster on CD, or an original MOP vinyl. Even the Music For Nations MOP Vinyls sound way better than this new vinyl remaster from Warner. Don't get me wrong I am a hardcore Metallica fan since 1995. Just steer clear of these remasters of Metallica albums on vinyl."
5,Metallica in rare form,"I didn't see any reviews of this album so I had to review it. This album truly rocks. As Metallica grows in popularity and continues to evolve the older works seem to be forgotten. This album is awesome and easily better than their current work(in my opinion). This is not to say the current work is bad. Some die hards will tell you the band began to sell out after And Justice but evolve is the term to use. Metallica is the Led Zepplin of the younger generation. Every song a hit, every album a treasure."
5,METALLICA before they were abducted by aliens,"I love this album, (old) Metallica is my favorite band, too bad they don't exist any more. For anyone who is reading this review and is not a metal listener, i suggest you should buy this. But I have a hard time deciding which one is a better album, Ride The Lightning or this one, who cares? They're both good, because this is (old) Metallica, when the band members had long hair, and B@! $ (<---figure that out) :-)."
5,Not a 3 LP Vinyl,"I bought this because it said 3 LP Vinyl.... and it was just 2 when it arrived.... Shame on you Amazon!!!! Nevertheless it's MASTER OF PUPPETS, so you can't miss...."
3,Three Stars For Three Good Tracks,"I'm not sure why this album is so coveted by Metallica fans, since I only really like 3 songs on the disc. As I've said before, it's my opinion that Metallica has great songs but terrible albums. True to form, this album, in my view, only delivers a handful of good jams. Tracks #1, 2, and 4 are the best and hardest rockers on the album. The rest of the album is for diehard Metallica fans."
2,Metallica=The Kenny G of thrash metal!,"Master of Puppets is one of the most overhyped thrash metal records in existance, right up there with the awful Reign in Blood by Slayer. Everybody talks about how complicated the musicianship is and how heavy the sound is, but the truth is that Metallica are one of the lightest thrash metal bands. This record is easy listening compared to Death, Megadeth, Morbid Angel, Hate Eternal, etc. Those bands make Master of Puppets look like the latest Kenny G hit on an ""easy listening"" radio station!!! If you're looking for a heavy band, you might as well forget about listening to Metallica. But if you're a big fan of easy listening, I definately reccomend ""Master of Puppets"" to you! It'll go great with your ""Kenny G Greatest Hits"" CD! LOL!!!"
5,Three words:OH MY GOD!!!,"I was first introduced to Metallica with the Black album, which is great, but this;this;this;this is the ""Matrix"" of heavy metal. Good go, man;how can they possibnly play this fast? Thos is pure genius from top to bottom, and even though Kirk Hammett is superb, Cliff Buton is THE MAN on this whole album,he owns at least SIX of the best guitar solos of all time! I can't decide if this or Guns N Roses Appetite For Destruction is the best rock album of the 80's but get both; NOW!!!"
5,"METALLICA""S BEST WORK","Hey everyone...i believe this is the best album ever released by metallica...actually the best album ever released. guitar is at its best possible in this cd. although the black album is also an excellent cd, master of puppets is pure genious...congratulations, metallica!"
5,"I rather place six stars to this CD, if u aint got it get it","This one is the best Metallica cd, ever. They will never play the god old metal that they played in the early 80's. Why? 1. Cliff Burton is away. 2. Kirk can't play the old fast riffs anymore. 3.Because they have choosed country instead of metal. Just listen to the ""Load"" album. okok Garage inc is ok but what, they are playing covers. Metal of others insperience. That's bad. But U can't be best forever!"
3,Thrash!,"I feel this is Metallica's last album worth listening to. The follow-up album, And Justice For All's production was a wreck, and after that they went alternative (Can u say 'sellout'?) But on this last album with original bassist Cliff Burton, the band thrashes hard. The band covers all subjects on the album from money in 'Leper Messiah', drugs in the title track, war in 'Disposable Heroes', and big things marching around in 'The Thing That Should Not Be'."
4,It's Good ... But who's To say what Good Is,"I purchased this CD for ""The Thing That Should Not Be"" and only for that reason. Anyway mostly everyone has given this CD 5 stars now that should tell you something right away ... this is a good effort by Metallica to break away from that ""Euro - Metal"" Sound and they succeeded to where they make the stuff they do today... I like Orion the best it stays on repeat. :o)"
5,METALLICA'S SECOND BEST,"""Master of Puppets"" is Metallica's second best album (only ""Ride the Lightning"" is superior), and my god, no one makes metal music like this anymore. James Hetfield's rhythm section is unbelieveably fast and Kirk Hammett's solos are electrifying. Lars Ulrich's drum smashing keeps a steady beat throughout all the craziness on the album, and Cliff Burton (the God of bass) truly is the greatest bassist of all time, and he proves it here. Every song is memorable, not one filler song can be found on here. ""Master of Puppets"" and ""Ride the Lightning"" are definitive thrash albums that every metalhead should have, and if you don't, get 'em."
2,MASTER OF NOTHING,I'm not a metal head - but am diversified in my musical taste - Nothing Metallica has done can compare to the Sandman album. This one is ok but all you do is compare it to sandman - thats all i have to say
1,"So, What's the Big deal?","I am very confused as to why this band and especially this album are so legendary. They Blow. End of Story. Same stuff, again, and again. It gets old after about 20 seconds. seriously. This has to be the most ovverated bands of all time, seriously. It's lame, you can never even hear the bass, it's like there isn't one, while the drummer just keeps on hitting those god damn crash symbols again and again and again. Is this music actually worth listening to? The guitar keeps playing the same riffs over and over as well. And these are long songs! like 8 min. that's ridiculous! however if you like boring music this band should be near the top of your list, right up there with Elevator music and Kenny. G.But what do I know? I'm just a stupid 14 year old!But you'll agree with every word I wrote after you waste money on this garbage.:)(Incase you didn't catch on Metallica basically blows period)"
1,wht?!,"this is the most overrated metal album of all timenothing special ,just regular metal albumits not really bad album but there's so many album that better then this, maybe metallica fans can only say ""this album sold alot then other bands album"" ok, that's a fact i know. but, dont forget sales mean nothing to proof quality, backstreet boys album sold more then 10 M too just like black album.master of puppet sold 6 million in 18 years. 50 cents album sold 6 million in one year. SO SALES DOESN T PROOFso honestly i never like this album much,the title trackis good, also orion."
5,Master...MASTER!!!,"let me start by saying that I am NOT a fan of thrash/speed/death metal. Having said that, if you want to have the obligatory metal album in your metal deficient CD collection, you can't go wrong by making it this one. Metallica was balls-to-the-wall on this one. My favorite tracks are Battery and of course the title track. Guess what, the louder you play it the better it sounds, although your neighbors might not think so. Hail Metallica!www.electriceyes.us"
5,MASTER OF METALLICA...,"Why do people like Metal music?Cause it expresses an attitude that people would like to live out in real life, but don't cause they don't want to go to jail for assault.So they let that aggression out when they listen to Metal music.And I can't think of a better album to get your aggressions out on than ""Masters of Puppets"".DAMAGE,INC 10/10Battery 10/10Masters of Puppets 10/10The whole album ROCKS, but these are my favorite!!I rate this album a 5 of 5 stars!!"
5,Perfect,"Master of Puppets is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best heavy metal album ever released by any band. Every song is intelligently written with lyrics that fit the songs perfectly. Even on ""Orion,"" one of the greatest instrumental rock songs ever, the harmonized guitars seem to have a voice - a harmony that very few bands have ever been able to accomplish. Nearly every song is around 7 or 8 minutes long, but it never becomes boring or uninteresting. What sets this album apart from other Metallica albums and other great albums is that it has an epic, special sound. Only one word can describe the perfectly structured compositions and well thought out lyrics : Perfect."
5,WoW this is the best metallica album ever buy it right away,this was the first metal album i purchased.......and i just wanted to say WOW this is truly a classic album from #1 to 8 classic back to back to back to back............what else can i say
4,Classic Metallica,"First of all, to those who dont like THRASH metal, this is NOT all thrash.Speed metal songs are BATTERY, DISPOSABLE HEROS, and DAMAGE,INC. MASTER OF PUPPETS have moments of speed, but has a change in tempo throughout...A masterpice of arrangement !Slower, HEAVY songs are SANITARIUM, THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE, ORION (instrumental) and LEPER MESSIAH.This is not just speed metal, but a mixture of Black Sabbath-type melodies and the anger of hardcore punk rock.After all, this is why Metallica is a step above the rest....A classic album - timeless !"
1,The guy below me is retarded...,"... the simple fact that he thinks ""master of puppets"" is the greatest thing since sliced bread,its moronic stupidity from a teenage suburban loser with no life. I beleive in people having the right to their own opinion and all, thats their right, but this retard insulted judas preist at the end of his review, being a preist fan i could not let that go. i wounder if this poser has even listened to metal,IF IT WERN'T FOR JUDAS PREIST THERE WOULD BE NO METALLICA OR METAL IN GENERAL YOU DUMB [...]! ""master of puppets"" is nothing compared to real metal of the 80's, just go listen to ""holydiver"" from dio or ""powerslave"" from maiden and hear how much better the songwritting is. i hate how this god dam album gets praised, it pi$$es me off.[...]"
4,ORION ROCKS!,I think my favorite track from all of Metallica is Orion. I'm not really a huge fan to them. I just like this and the black album.
3,Good For A Few Months,This is a good album to listen to for a few months but it gets old/and repetitive after awile. It seems like the songs are very similar to me.Battery and Damange Inc sound alikeMaster Of Puppets and Disposable Heroes sound alikeThe Thing That Should Not Be and Leper Messiah sound alike.The two unique songs are the best on the album.Orion is amazing. Cliff Burton is an outstanding bassist.Sanitarium is also a great song.I think Metallica reached there peak with And Justice For All. That album has by far better songwriting then Master of Puppets. I find that album to have much more variety and it stands the test of time much better then Master of Puppets.This is not a bad record but I think there are better thrash albums out there.And Justice For All: MetallicaKill Em' All : MetallicaPeace Sells But Who's Buying: MegadethRust In Peace: MegadethSpreading The Disease: AnthraxPainkiller: Judas Priest
4,overrated,Wow how is this the best metal album made ever ? i mean it is great and is one ofthe best not it is so overrated and the entire band is also lars is a average drummer not really great and kirk not that great guairtist. I do like them but people stop saying they are the greatest metal band because they are not
5,The best album of all times.,This is simply the best album ever recorded. Every song is genial. This albuem is the main reason why Metallica is the greatest heavy metal band. A must-have for any heavy-metal fan.
5,One of the BEST albums ever!!!!!!!!!,"For the last two years, I'v been listing to Metallica and I think that Master of Puppest is one of the best(even though Ride the Lghtning is pretty good). This album shows Cliff Burton at his best and it shows that there is no limet for music. If you like Metallica, then you should like this album. -- Ryan Fels"
4,Overrated,"There, I said it! There are a lot of better albums around. A remix could do wonders to this CD! Note: I'm not bashing this album, for it is truly a great one, that's why Im giving it four stars. However, it is overrated."
5,Perfect Xmas Gift!!,"Metallica CD-""Master of Puppets"" was a Perfect CD Xmas gift formy Hubby. He's a Huge Metallica FAN!! CD is Great, good music,makes u want 2 bang ur head!!!"
5,Simply The Best Metal Album Ever Made,"Metallica are metal gods, and if you're wondering why, just pick this cd up. Even if you're not an 80's metal freak, myself included, Metallica is still the best band you will ever have the privelige to listen to. It doesn't get any better than these guys, it just doesn't. The Beatles can't even touch them. Of course everyone knows the track Master Of Puppets, but another you may not know about is Orion, a masterful orgy of guitar genius. Throw the insane speed metal of Damage Inc. and the ahead of its time, detuned Thing That Should Not Be, and you've got the most rounded record of it's time. Don't believe me? I challenge anyone with some music theory knowledge and little guitar know how to prove me wrong. SIMPLY THE BEST BAND TO EXIST ON THIS EARTH. Proove me wrong. You can't."
5,The ULTIMATE Metallica album EVER!!!,"This is THE album for any true Metallica fan. anyone that can stand up and say that this isn't the finest Metallica ever is a self-admitting Metalli-fraud! Complete with an outstanding instrumental track (Orion), Master of Puppets shows off their skills at the maximum, even bassist Cliff Burton shines through with a solo on Orion (yeah, that second to last solo is Cliff, read your inserts!)! For the die hard fan or the youngsters that need to get hit in the head with true metal that can only be surrvived, this album is a Bible on any CD shelf!!!"
5,The Best Metallica CD Ever Made!,"This is the most exciting album Metallica ever made! Don't let the classical guitar intro to ""Battery"" fool you, this cd kicks a**! If you care about great thrash metal bands like Metallica, buy this album, don't download it! Show your pride for metal, buy this cd, show people the evil devil's horns hand signal, and keep on listening to loud heart punding music until you're six feet underground!"
5,MASTER OF THRASH,THE DEFINTIVE THRASH METAL ALBUM EVER MADE AS WELL AS ONE OF METALLICAS BEST. NOTHING SHORT OF A MASTERPIECE.SANITARIUM IS A BEATIFUL BALLAD. BATTERY AND DAMAGE INC ARE AWESOME SPEED-DRIVEN TUNES. A MUST-HAVE.
1,Awful...,This could be one of the worst records ever released. The guitars and bass sound more like chainsaws than musical instruments. The drums sound like somebody breaking cement with a jackhammer.And the vocals...James Hetfield's monotonous roar sounds like a horse grunting. Not to mention that he looks like one too. That proves just how bad Metallica is. Their greatest artistic acheivement is having the most horse-like hairstyles of any band in the music business! I am appauled!Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. Just because Hetfield has the most horse-like hairstyle is no reason to listen to their music. I think Metallica is the worst band of the late 80s/early 90s. (...)
1,This is 100% proof of what's wrong w....,"This is 100% proof of what's wrong with music today. This boy can't sing to save his life and yet he gets a record deal and infinite rotation on mtv. How you ask? It's simple, he has connections. This is a testament to the awful and pathetic state the music industry is in today. You want to know who's to blame for making music so horrible these days? MTV and American radio. Those two are the main culprits. If you have a brain you'll stay clear of the two."
5,"If u don't like it, ur no Metallica fan!","This CD rocks. I bought it and I couldn't be happier I did. The best songs are probably Leper Messiah and Sanitarium. If u don't have this CD, go buy it now!"
5,metal masterpiece,The best metal album metallica has ever done .My favorite songs on the album are MASTER OF PUPPETS and DAMAGE INC. Metallica definetly didn't sell out on this one.
5,best thrash album ever PERIOD,"metallica's my fav band of all time and this album definitly has it all.it really sucks that this is their last album with cliff (R.I.P)cause he was the best bass player the world has ever seen,if you dont beleive me check out his bass solo in orion it rules intensive care and his bass solos in other albums before puppets.the guitar sound on this album is unlike anything i ever heard before (very guitarish).the songs are VERY brutal,speed that will blow your head off (battery,Damage,Inc.)a haunting ballad (sanitarium) and the best metallica song on here (and my fav of all time) MASTER OF PUPPETS,the vocals,riffs,drums and the laughing at the ending is cool.if your starting to become a metallica fan i recommend this one because this is a masterpiece and this will NEVER bore you."
5,Acaso hay un mejor CD de Metal??,"Definitivamente es el mejor CD de Heavy Metal que jamás se halla realizado en la historia de la música, de inicio a fin es fuerte.SEE YAA!!!"
5,Product works as expected,"Got this battery which is an exact replacement for the dead one I took out of my watch. The product definitely works as expected. The only negative feedback I have is for the seller. The product arrived several days after the latest estimated delivery date. This technically was outside of the sellers control, but they failed to proactively inform me that my delivery would be delayed, even though they knew it was going to be delayed."
5,small battery,I ordered a battery for my wife's small battery powered clock. The clock is part of her minature New Mexico collection. The cock is once again working.
4,Seiko Watch Battery,"This battery is hard to find in stores. It was actually priced too low, but I bought it any way because I needed the battery. It works perfectly."
4,Has charm,"This old faithful seems to phase in out and out of availability depending on fluctuations in the space/time continuum (also known as ""who has the rights?"")It doesn't date because the music was considered somewhat cheesy at the time. What most sticks out in the memory is the comedy drumming. Any excuse to do a drumroll in an otherwise dependably uninspired metronome.In my original sleevenotes there is scribbled tales of woe for the band and ""the sacking of Nick Turner and the return of our old friend from ""magic Muscle"", whomever that could be. Business as usual then in the 31st Century."
5,A fantastic collection,It is a pleasure to hear this collection. Quark is one of Hawkwinds most creative efforts. It also harkens to a time when Hawkwind was more interested in making fine music than fussing amongst themselves. All the tracks receives a digital remastering that is truly amazing. Unreleased versions and remixes also add to the magic. Great stuff good for Hawkwind die hards and casuals alike.
4,Excellent,"As the 1970s went on, Hawkwind streemlined their sound. This is not saying the sound became more commercial. These guys were about as mainstreem as the elephant man in a frat house.But they did begin to mix the floating electronics in their music back. This put the emphasis on the lean guitar and bass lines. The change does not make Quark Strangeness and Charm punk, or New Wave, although this might have been implied in the subtext.Tracks like ""Spirt Of The Age,"" and ""Damnation Alley"" have a stripped, driving feel, and this actually gives them a fresh energy. The vocals are more clear and up front then on the early 1970s albums, particularlySpace Ritual. This emphasizes playing over wierdness, and shows how good this band is here.The approaches are different, but both are excellent, and this is a great disc for both fans and staters."
5,awesome desserts!,"I just made the mint ice cream with mint from my yard....it was the best ice cream I ever made! I am now baking the coconut lime coolers, (they are in the oven right now...) and they promise to be glorious also. My hubby says,,,what are you baking..it smells so good! Keep up with the recipes....more, more!"
3,"Love Jeremy Jackson, not so much this book","This book is inspiring and allows you to use up all the leftover limes from the mojitos from you're last party...but when I have made the recipes they did not turn out good. The recipes are creative, and it gives a creative baker a good jump off point. The orange sugar cookies turned out to be little cakes instead of cookies. My taste retarded brother liked them anyways."
5,extremum=extreme pleasure,"Extremum,from a great dark band called Die Form,is a great album.Being a fan of their other albums,especially Duality,they always have very strange,sexually moody,erotic tones in their music.Not for the faint hearted!If you enjoy macabre music,this album is for you.This album is a bit slower than theur other ones.But still just as effective.Definately an album filled with fantasies of sugarplums and opium filled dreams."
2,Mick Jones owes Ian Hunter big time for this debacle,"I remember at the time being profoundly disappointed by this album upon release. Credit Hunter to being open to try new things (as opposed to many of his contemporaries at the time---can you imagine Springsteen going to someone from the Clash or Sex Pistols in the early 80's?), but this is a failure. While some of the songs are not Hunter's strongest, the fault must go largely to the production. As the late great Mick Ronson had a hand in production with some of Hunter's other work, the credit (or blame) must go to Jones. First off, the sound is atrocious, easily Hunter's worst album sonically going back to the first couple of Mott albums. Second, the sound effects and kitchen sink, 'close your eyes and press a button' approach that Jones used doesn't do his idol justice. Make sure and check out Ian Hunter's current album to see how vibrant and dynamic a writer and artist Hunter still very much is."
2,Hunter gives up,"Ian Hunter has only been as good as the musicians around him. Ian is a fantastic and underappreciated songwriter with a Dylan voice. When he really cares and he's joined by good musicians who also care, the result is magic! (See: Ian Hunter, All American Alien Boy, You're Never Alone With A Schizophrenic, and YUIORTA) On this disc, it seems that Hunter (and Ronson) let Mick Jones come in and take over. Jones claimed to be a Hunter fan, but he trashes the music here. The second disc gives a hint of what Short Back n Sides could have been, but there is little insight beyond that. For die hard Hunter fans only."
2,Blech,"I gave up on Ian Hunter with this album. What a jumbled, throw-everything-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks mess! Allegedly coproduced by the Clash's Mick Jones, but I'm guessing it's really Foreigner's Mick Jones, as the production, arrangements, and everything seem designed to hide Ian Hunter's unique style, not showcase it. Maybe it was naive to think that Jones would help Hunter come up with something as great as the early '70s Mott albums, or even the first solo album. Then again, maybe Ian wanted to do this, or the record company imposed it. Still, one would be better served with just about anything else from the man's catalog."
4,Senza Fine magnifica,"Just saw the movie ""Da Savoir"", where the apropos finale song to that picture was Peggy Lee's ""Senza Fine"". Not only did that song punctuate the movie's ending, but her soulful, earthy, sultry and ever so understatedly gorgeous rendition of this song totally mesmerized me. The only problem with this version is that it doesn't go on forever, like the love mentioned in the song's lyrics. I have never been so touched by any of Peggy's vocal renditions as this one in particular. That is a heck of a statement for me to make, given her vast and glorious repertoire!"
2,Basic and cheap train,"I only use this for Christmas time around a small tree. It is VERY touchy about track alignment and derails very easily. The wheel trucks are plastic and come off easily. The hitches also bend or break easily. From what I have seen, very typical of cheaper HO systems. I am used to sturdy O gauge Lionel and this doesn't come close. It's OK for decoration with my Dr. Seuss themed tree but not very durable for everyday use."
4,Description from back cover of paperback edition,"Runes were used in ancient times by the Germanic and Norse-speaking peoples of northern Europe for inscriptions, magic, and fortune-telling. Now Rune Games introduces the Angle-Saxon 'Rune Poem', and uses the runic letters as oracles, showing how the runes may be used like the Chinese I Ching for meditation and self-development as well as prophetic divination.There are eight games, arranged in order of increasing complexity, designed to stimulate the intellect and the imagination, releasing potentials which are hidden from the everyday, non-magical mind. Players can project the possible outcome of particular aspects of their lives, and perceiving the degree to which they create their own fortune, they can take firmer control of their future."
4,Pleased with results,"I have only been taking Menopause One for one week. I was having hot flashes at least once an hour. I have now only been having 4 or 5 a day. I am also sleeping better at night. I am hoping this will decrease the longer I take them, but for now I am very glad for the relief I have."
4,"Quick ship, secure packaging",Just began using this product in place of another vitamin (Raw for Women) that I had used for a long time.Hopefully it fulfills all it claims ;>)
3,I liked this product,"This product is okay it did give me energy but my menopause are just now calming down after about three weeks, I think since its natural it may take longer to really work , however I like the idea of taking one a day. It does pep me you with the energy I really need and like this about the product."
3,Low Quality Image,"I'm disappointed by the image quality on this poster, it's a 24x36, but maybe it should've been smaller as a large portion of it is a quote. Had I seen it in a store I would not have purchased it."
2,Partial Order Received,The product advertised shows three different size oil filter removal wrenches. Only the largest size was sent. I believe that I was shortchanged relative to the image advertised versus the product received.
2,Battle Redux,"If you've read Gene Sledge's account of Peleliu, you've already got the feel of the battle. K/3/5 was ""his"" outfit, so their stories are his story from a different perspective. While it's rarely a bad thing to have another book, if you are short on shelf space, and you have ""With the Old Breed..."", you don't need this one."
4,"Great Amp, but you goota be kidding about the price.","This is a real workhorse of an amplifier. I've had one in the studio that I bought used over 10 years ago, and I've never had any complaints.But that must be a misprint about the $2,200 price tag.You'd be crazy to spend over $200 for one, and you'd likely get one for closer to $100 if you shop around."
4,"Thorough, Generous, Beautifully Illustrated","This book is unique in its balance of primary sources and their interpretations. All the figures you'd expect are present: Macchiavelli, Luther, Locke, Paine, Engles, Freud, etc. And with secondary sources coming from Fromm, Ulam, et. al, the data is clearly and comprehensively analyzed. What readers will appreciate are the generous illustrations throughout the text which give you some idea how the philosophies/theories/values of the times are reflected in visual media. What some readers won't appreaciate is the single-spaced type that changes font and styles so often that one might get motion sickness. It's a minor point that has nothing to do with the value of the texts presented, but it does interfere with the pleasure of reading. Still, this is a great history book to teach from or just as a casual read/refresher for the history fan."
3,book,The book was listed as almost as good as new condition. I don't agree with that description but I am satisfied with my purchase.
5,Great Musician and great cd,"I had the pleasure of being Roberts neighbor in california. He's a great guy and an amazing musician. He plays all the instruments on the cd and it all comes together nicely. I find many of the songs soulful especially when you read the backstory behind them in the cd jacket. There is a hidden track thats very beatles influenced as well.If your looking for a great progressive/easy rock cd, this one should be high on your list. Robert gave me an autographed copy of this cd when I was 19, now at 30 this cd is still on regular rotation in my cd player."
4,A guilty pleasure,"Why do I call this a guilty pleasure: JUST LOOK AT THAT COVER! Those outfits! That hair! The fog machine! Oh man.But it's the music that counts, and this is a very good album. George Lynch remains one of rock's most underrated guitarists. Check out ""The Hunter"" (which contains one of my all-time favorite guitar solos) and ""In My Dreams"" (which was covered by a dance band called ""The Party"" in 1991 -- their version sounds nothing like the one here). ""Slippin' Away"" and ""Will The Sun Rise?"" are also good tracks...as is the rest of the album. A fine effort by Dokken that pays off."
5,"The best ""Hair metal"" has to offer.","Dokken, yes they're a part of the much maligned ""hair metal"" genre. And YES, they look like they had spent a day in their sisters closets by the looks of this GODAWFUL album cover. But to put it simply, the music is KILLER. Why? Two reasons: George Lynch and Don Dokken. Don's Klaus Meinesque singing isn't pure sissy cheese like alot of his peers of the period, and George Lynch has the tone of Schenker mixed with the inventiveness of EVH and the melody of Randy Rhoads to create some of the best riffs and solos in the period."
4,George Lynch could make Polka sound good!!,"Right from the start, 'Unchain the Night' grabs you and doesn't let go until a couple of filler songs toward the end. Even then it bails itself out nicely with the screaming, back and forth duelling guitar licks of 'til the living end' to close out the disc.If you like Dokken, this will more than satisfy."
5,Say hello to Mr. Scary,"This is not the first Dokken recording. But it again showcases the extraordinary guitar playing of George Lynch. He has a great sense of melody and can still play fast too. I enjoy his playing a great deal, including Tierra Del Fuego on one of his solo CDs."
3,Not bad....but the songs sound the same over and over.,"This is not a bad release, but to me after the 4th song they all start sounding the same. The production is really good and again Lynch sounds the best. But to me it is just not as raw as it could have been. Its obvious that the band was shooting for MTV awards and not for glam metal supremacy."
3,HAIR METAL,DOKKEN UNDER LOCK AND KEY IS FOR THE PERSON WHO STILL ENJOY'S HAIR METAL BANDS OF THE 80'S.
2,"Hey, we were all young once!","Only thing that saves this CD from a 1 is the song ""In My Dreams!!"" Dokken was to '80's metal what New Kids on the Block are to Country music, NOTHING!! Next!"
4,Dokken's finest hour!,"This 1985 effort found Dokken expanding into more radio friendly areas without sacrificing the quality of their music.The high marks are as always George Lynch's phenomenal guitar attack,Don Dokken's voice,while Pilson and Brown'rhytm section is as tight as it can get.Every song on this album counts-an instant metal classic!"
2,Not very good,"These stories about a has been screenwriter are much lauded by some, but there is a reason they are so forgotten. A product of Fitzgerald's last couple of years when he had fallen to being a second tier hack screenwriter at Universal, they are proof that he was not really capable of more near the end.The stories are of a comic nature with the main character of Pat Hobby serving as their punchline. Hobby is an unappealing self-pitying schlub of a character, and much of the humor is of a nasty and cartoonishly meanspirited variety. It all reads like warmed over Nathaniel West without the warmth or vivacity, it is genuine hack work. Fitzgerald may be a great writer but there is a reason that his reputation ends with the 1920s."
4,Nice story...,"The book is about Alexis Montague Pearson and you immediately feel sorry for her character who is preparing for her cousin's wedding while dealing with her own breakup. In the midst of her drama her boss is inappropriate and she files a sexual harassment suit against him.Alexis attends Tae Kwon Do Class to learn how to defend herself as well as burn off steam it is there she meets and is annoyed by Remedy Brown. During a spar in their class she breaks his arm....Remedy likes Alexis and uses his broken arm as a way to get close to her. Remedy has baggage in his ex-wife Ayzah. Throughout this book you are rooting for Remedy and Alexis but Ayzah's ""ghetto"" drama keeps book moving along...I think this was a pretty good read. This is the first book I have read from this author and I would recommend ths book."
5,The best reggae group of time,"this cd ranks up there with earth crisis and true democracy as their best work. This isnt no ub40, this group has substance check out save black music, not the king james version and blessed is the man. Plus the ballads dont be afraid and love walks out are crucial. David Hinds is at his lyrical best on this cd, if you want to hear the best i recommend this cd."
2,or...,"In order to contrast the other extrememly optimistic reviews, i have to contradict. If you are interested in Steel Pulse buy Earth Crisis, True Democracy, Sound System, Handsworth Revolution. This album is dissapointing and it just doesn't compare. In the past it seems that SP just had things to sing about and the music came out naturaly. One review says they send a strong cultural message, the third track is about having a crush on your teacher. It seems like they are forcing it. Also there is just too much synthesising, and electric guitar solo's. Its not a bad album and some my like it. You might want to listen to it a little before you buy it. Download songspy or limewire now that napsters gone. I can only give it two stars."
3,Good Value,"There's lot of garbage out there. Onkyo make a higher value product than most, e.g. Denon/Sony quality without the name-brand surcharge. Prefer it over weak bass Yamaha (for satellite speakers, it's great) or shrill H/K (if you have truly high-fidelity speaker systems, get this one). My overall value favorite is Newcastle by Inkel, the value line for receivers (for separate components, get Parasound), that's why I own two Newcastle receivers and four Parasound components... and an old discrete output, full bandwidth Denon for the Ranch A/V system and a Pioneer receiver for the test/calibration bench."
4,onkyo av,"This AV was the perfect partner for the Yamaha home theater speakers we also purchased. As a small home theater sound system for my in-laws this works perfectly. Sounds great, not difficult to use. They love it."
5,Excellent Job.,"Besides all the merits others have told, it's going with FM/AM. You don't need to buy extra device for the radio. And it's going with speaker cable labels, which makes you easily to manage lots of wires. An excellent receiver at this price."
2,Makes strange noises when using digital output.,"I had the TX-SR304. Everything sounded great. However, certain times when I played my DVD, the Onyko produced a loud high-pitched ear-piercing sound. Sounds almost like a record scratching. The most common times it made this sound was during the DVD menu, when it replays the music theme. The receiver would transition from Dolby Digital to stereo then back to DD again, then making that loud sound. Everything was great, but this one problem made me return this item, which is a bummer because I would have kept it otherwise."
2,"Early failure, late repair","I bought an Onkyo TX-SR304 in April 2007. It was fine while it worked. It failed in November. I dropped it off at Allen's Inc, the authorized repair facility in San Diego on 12/3. As of 1/17/08 Allen's says it has not diagnosed the problem. Onkyo does not answer the phone or email.It is not a product with acceptable up-time."
2,I have yet to install this item. Will get back to you as soon as I do.,I have yet to install this item. Will get back to you as soon as I do
3,underpowered,"I bought this reciever when my magnovox decided to quit on me, and after reading the reviews, I thought this was the one but although the features are nice, I have to turn the volume to max to get the same performance as my old reciever at about one third. and they where around the same price point. I wish I would have spent a little more and got better performance (hind sight), but It will do for now."
2,Not that great,"Got this receiver because I wanted an inexpensive Amp/Receiver for my HDTV, BlueRay and Satellite Radio setup with 2 digital/optical inputs. Ended up returning it to Amazon (very easy; super customer service!)due to the annoying hum it puts out on my $200 speakers at low/no volume. I think if you are kinda picky, like me, you have to spend more than $160 on a receiver to be happy with it. If you play the music on the loud side, you may not notice the slight hum, but I did. Also the speaker wire terminals were annoyingly small and cheap--I could not use them with premium cables; had to use smaller cheaper speaker wire. On the plus side, all other options on this unit worked great, and it has lots of connections, but NO HDMI connections for this price range receiver. It also has good Dolby decoders, etc. and 5.1 speaker outputs. The remote also works fine. Another plus is that it's easy to set up; took me about an hour compared to 2 days for my Denon receiver."
5,Great receiver!!,"I purchased this receiver to create a home theater system where all the speakers are from SONY and the DVD player is from Philips (plays all format). The receiver does an excellent job. If you are looking for a low priced receiver with highest quality, buy this."
4,Nice on its own.,I've had this unit for about 18 months. Sound quality is top notch.Only problems I have encountered:I have a sub hooked up to it. The unit just doesn't feed the sub correctly; its just kind of washed out by the regular speakers.Its not really meant for use with an amp- all the audio out jacks are fixed volume. You'll need to make your own cables to go from the speaker terminals to the audio in on the amp.Onkyos help lines are also somewhat lacking....
5,Just as it should be,Works exactly like I wanted Have really found no problems other than the receiver makes a loud click when turned on and off but just being picky. For a entry level 5.1 this is a good choice but if you have todays newer technologies in your home theater you may want to look higher
3,Onkyo TX-SR304S/ Pro's and Con's,"This unit has the perfect weigth and diameters I needed for my component rack. The unit is very ligth about 18 lbs easy and basic hook-ups; the front panel has nice tigth look. The LED read out has a soft yellow glow easy to read sit-up.The sound quality;between Fair and good I perfer the 2.0 and 5.1 stereo audio reproduction play back for CD'S versa DVD audio play back. I think the Home Theater/Mulitchannel, Doby DTS ect........audio format is good but could use more watts for all four channels. This particularly Onkyo the TX-SR304S 5.1 does not match up wellas far power for my Infinity's HTS system that was recommded for"
4,Satisfactory Electronics,"This unit provides all the features I need and has ver good sound. It was easy to set up and use. A good value for the price if you don't extremely high end results,"
1,You get what you pay for.,This unit is difficult to set up. Auto config for speakers does not work. Manual is a joke. Sound quality is poor to bad. I would not buy another Onkyo product. I am back to Sony next time.
3,The Troggs-'Live At Max's Kansas City'(President Records),"I was sort of caught off guard when I first got me a copy of this CD. Very little info is provided but as close as I could tell, this disc's archive performance was recorded at the famed Max's Kansas City club sometime in the 1980. Includes two original members, vocalist Reg Presley and drummer Ronnie Bond with two unknown players. The band plays a couple of covers like the Stone's ""Satisfaction"" and Chuck Berry's ""No Particular Place To Go"". The real treat is to hear them play their own material as they sound fine on ""Love Is All Around"", ""Feels Like A Woman"", ""Give It To Me"" and of course ""Wild Thing"". Some pleasant memories can be had here. I'd give it a 3 1/2 star rating."
5,"Allison Buffy Christen, full name","I thought the Biik was great! I read it over a Hundred times, I think it is because I love the show so much, and Sarah Michelle Gellar is a great actress for the part of Buffy. I truly Loved the Book!!!!!"
3,Your Better Off Reading The Harvest,This is book was not as good as I expected it to be! The author spends 8 pages on just one thing. This Buffy book is nowherer near as good as the Harvest. Your better of buying that.
5,This book rocked!!!,I thought this book was great!! it was a very exiting and thrilling book of one of Buffys many adventures. GO BUFFY!!!
4,"Pure, Scary Fun!!!!!","This Buffy book is one of the scariest in the series. Next to ""Blooded"" its the best Buffy book. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I read it all in one night. I could not put it down. I was spooky too. I love to be scared, therefore I loved this book! I recommend this book to every Buffy fan who loves to be scared! Great fun! Exciting! Thrilling, etc!!!"
3,missing the funny bite (intended),"although the story was quite scary, I was missing the humor present in other books."
4,halloween a normal night? ha ha,buffy and the scooby gang set out to have a normal halloween. butas the vampire slayer she knows that this will probaly not happen. when she hears the tale of a scarecrow that kills peopleshe is on her guard. but is she ready to take on zombies and allthe other things that go bump in the night? they do not take avacation just because the slayer wants down time to spend withfriends and a special honey.
4,Buffy Books are GreatT,I LOVE ALL THE BUFFY BOOKS. I STARTED READING THEM A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED WATCHING THE SHOW ON [local channel]. IF YOU LIKE ADVENTURE AND COMEDY AND SEEING PEOPLE GET THEIR [rear] KICKED BY OTHER PEOPLE YOU WILL LOVE THE BOOKS AND THE TV SHOWS. I REALLY THINK THIS BOOK IS A GREAT BOOK. I WILL READ IT OVER AND OVER.
4,Very unique,"I am a huge Buffy fan and I have read many of the novels. To be honest, when I read the book preview, I thought it sounded cheesy and I was convinced that I wouldn't like it. Boy was I wrong. I wound up really enjoying the story because it was so unique and the character development was quite good. I may even reread the book. I would definately recommend it!"
1,This isn't Buffy,"This book was unmitigatedly awful. There is far better Buffy writing at Internet fanfic sites. Their descriptions of Samhain were bizarre and completely made up (Celtic pumpkin kings, forsooth) and the dialogue and characterisation in no way captured the humour, inventiveness and wit loyal viewers expect. Reading this book was a teeth-grindingly terrible experience, and I am definitely going to stick to watching the TV show from now on. Joss Whedon knows what he's doing."
4,Time Machine,"Apparently, you need Plating Current to time travel. Who knew? Every time they show the doctors machine, he flips a switch labeled PLATING CURRENT."
4,Not for amatuers,"This is definitely a book for systems administrators. You won't learn the basics about sendmail, or get an introduction. This book is for folks who generally know sendmail, but are having specific issues with it.The first chapter has a lot of very specific fixes for a bunch of operating system specific issues. After that the solutions become a bit more general.The two standout chapters are chapter four, on relaying, and chapter six on spam filtering. Both of these have great introductions and in-depth techincal descriptions, with effective graphics, covering the topics.I recommend this book for systems administrators and for people actively using with sendmail."
5,Works great!,"This is best stuff for eliminating odor. Febreeze just covers it up, this actually eliminates the odor. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
4,SIlly me thought I would receive three bottles,Picture shows three bottles- why? yes they show quantity of 1. One what? kit or just one of the three bottles listed? Am I the only one that was confused by this? Will use product and write a user review
4,Great knife but flag/eagle design is one-side only,"I purchased this knife for my Webelos Cub Scout as his first official knife after he earned his Whittling Chip. It is a great first knife, just right for his kid-sized hand, and the lockback feature works well and it opens and closes easily. However, I was very disappointed that the cool flag and eagle design was only on ONE SIDE of the knife, with the other side being solid gray. It would have been so much better if they had done the cool design on both sides, which is what I was expecting when I ordered it."
5,Buck 525AM American Eagle Gent Lockback Folding Knife,This Buck 525AM American Eagle Gent Lockback Folding Knife is one of the best knives I have ever owned. FITS into my pocket and is american made to last. In my opinion it would make a great gift for that special person in your life. I love knives and this one is my all time favorite to carry with me when I am out and about. Also it's a great way to show your patriotism. Buck knives hit this one out of the park in my humble opinion.
2,"Nice stories, but little to back them up","The NDE stories of the blind in this book are not that strong, such as a blind person saying, ""I was this person do [something unique],"" and having that story backed up. Most of the stories are old and could only be loosely verified. In one story, a man had his sight before the NDE or incident, but subsequently lost his sight just before the NDE or afterwards. Perhaps the strongest story was one of a blind woman who saw her friend throwing up in a bathroom in another house. However, as with all the stories in the book, the authors attempt to verify the stories many years after the incident happened when some of the witness aren't even alive, so they take the person's word for what happened.All in all, I would say this is a quick attempt to make a buck, and jump on the NDE-Death-Reincarnation bandwagon. The book only has value if you are looking for a book on NDEs of the blind which cannot be verified thoroughly."
1,A great steaming heap of garbage.,"A stunning collection of pseudoscience and anecdotal evidence without a single redeeming value, except possibly as material for campfire ghost stories. This should appeal to new-age types who can't really buy into the religion thing, but have a need to believe in an afterlife anyway. If you wish to enjoy it, leave your critical thinking skills at the door."
3,FIRST KISS,"Since the plot has been described in several other reviews, I'd like to concentrate on the sumptious behind the scene areas this film does so well in. First, the coloring and use of it are marvelous; notice the brilliant red dress that sets the lovely Jennifer Daniels apart from the other party guests; the way Edward De Souza's hat matches his wife's riding outfit; the detail to the architecture in both the hotel and the chateau; the gorgeous and sinister music by James Bernard that director Don Sharp incorporates into the scene where Barry Warren plays its seduction to Daniels; and the effective use of wind and rain. This movie, first released in 1963 as Kiss of Evil, is not one of Hammer's best productions, but it is a rich, diffuse entry into the vampire genre, and Clifford Evans (looking a little like a middle-aged Sean Connery) has a malignant ferocity in his Van Helsing-like role.Not a classic, but definitely for fans of the Hammer days!"
2,LEE IS SORELY MISSED IN THIS THIRD HAMMER VAMPIRE TALE! NOW ON DVD!,"I am reviewing this film because I wanted to let Hammer fans know this is available on DVD. The DVD set called Hammer Horror series features 8 Hammer films including this one. I had never seen this film before and I would have to say I was not missing much. This movie has some unintentional laughs and Christopher Lee is sorely missed as the Prince Of Darkness. The over all production isn't bad but,the story is slow moving and there is not much action. Not one of Hammer's finer moments. The DVD transfer is very good."
1,This is for the DVD Not the Movie,"Like The ""Dracula Prince of Darkness"" DVD I Think Since Because The Hammer Horror Series Boxset has Come out I Think This Has went oop Too Bad Thank God I've Got This Edtion even though this movie is in the boxset i've just mentioned"
3,Not as good as its reputation.,"I was a little disappointed by this legendary Hammer Horror. It's one of the few so-called classics from the studio I wasn't familiar with beforehand, so naturally I was looking forward to finally seeing it. There are some atmospheric scenes; the car sequence at the beginning in particular, but it's actually a pretty dull movie. Nothing much happens for almost an hour, but a lot of boring squabble. (-""The Reptile"", also featuring the great Willman, is a masterpiece compared.) Director Sharp gives the film a somewhat cheap, almost TV-like, look. The famous bat-attack at the end is also a bit of a let-down, almost laughable. In many ways it's strangely unlike a '63 production, looking more like one of Hammer's early 70's quickies. A ""3 stars"" rating is probably a little too nice."
5,GREAT item!,"When I can't find organic here in Smalltown, USA, it is nice to have this spray on hand to scrub all of my produce."
3,it works with a bit of the jitters,it does the job but gives you an upseet tummy for about 20 mins. but it works
4,I miss Howard Hewett!!!,"Howard Hewett was the real talent in the group Shalamar and it's a shame his ""star"" did not rise to its full potential. I have always loved his voice and was heartbroken when Shalamar broke up. My all-time favorite song from Hewett is called ""For the Lover in You."" Does anyone have this album?? I want to buy it. God Bless you Howard Hewett wherever you are! With your talent, YOU DESERVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL!"
5,Best hammock!,"Bought the hammock and extra large hammock straps. Very easy! Both were very inexpensive, but incredible value. The hammock is cool, colorful and very comfortable. Highly recommend!"
3,could be better,Pro:This is truly a heavy duty strap. I have no worries about its strength. It could probably pull a car. The metal is solid too.Cons:It is long and is a pain in the but to wrap around a tree. depending on the size of the tree.You cant adjust it or make changes to perfect its length and placement around a tree. You can get it to work but it will take some time and trial and error. On one thick tree i couldn't get it where i wanted. But this is life.Overall it is a solid hardcore product.The hammock ain't going no where.
3,Missing part,Hammock Pawleys Island Tree Straps only came with one S hook unable to use until I go purchase an S hook.
4,Works great for a variety of applications,"I bought 3 sets of these - 1 for hammock and 2 for our treehouse swingset.The hammock works awesome - no complaints.My adaptation for these for our swinset was to wrap these harnesses around one of the thick branches in our backyard and hang chains from them for a swingset as to not damage the branch by having the chains lie on them directly. They work awesome, except I cant seem to keep them super tight. They loosen slightly and start to rub a bit during swinging making you lose momentum."
5,Perfect for the purpose,We had previously held our hammock up with chains. These straps made it so much easier to hang the hammock and adjust it to the height we wanted. Very happy with these.
3,Don't fit all trees,"Don't get me wrong. These work. Problem is, you wrap them around your tree until you can't make a full pass around the tree anymore and then you hang the hammock from the ring. On our trees (which are average sized older trees) they went around twice, but left so much of a tail that we would have to have them 15 feet in the air for the hammock to be off of the ground. So we had to use the screws anyway. We're still saving them for camping, though."
3,What I got looks good but....,"I received this to go with a Pawleys Island Hammock for my girlfriend's birthday this week-end. The Straps are of high quality as is the hardware...at least what I received. The Two (2) included ""S"" hooks were not included. This is irritating to be sure. The packaging is a clear blister pack so its not as if you couldn't see this before you stuck it in the box to ship. I am sure that Amazon will make this right but it does mean I will have to go buy a couple of ""S"" hooks from the store in order to get this up for the birthday."
5,Treehugger!,"Love that we can easily move the hammock anywhere on our acreage. Also great that we aren't damaging or slowly killing our trees. Instructions could be a little easier to follow, but the product works well once you figure it out."
2,Just so-so....,"I'm sorry to say I was disappointed with this video. The imagery was not very appealing, and the music was just so-so."
5,PURE TRANQUILITY,"This was the best 25 dollars I ever spent! Far more effective than any sleeping pill or sedative! The music and beautifully captured landscape puts you into a relaxing trance that is indescribable. After sleep, you feel relaxed and peaceful, and eager to begin a new journey!! Enjoy! This is one of my favorite gifts to give to friends, especially those who are extra stressed or going through tough times. It is a true gem!"
5,A true understanding of the struggle,"Even the most biased can learn something from this book, it was an absolute eye opener. From the actual level of British presence in Ireland and the lengths that her people have gone to protect her, Bandit Country also gives an insight to how meticulously and secretly the IRA operates on and how intelligent the Volunteers are, both academically and worldly. It also gives an insight of the British soldiers that should not have been allowed patrol such an area due to their youth and time ahead of them in their life. Both sides lost promising people, no matter what your views are on the situation in Northern Ireland. What is most astonishing is that the book only covers one particular area in one of the 32 counties in Ireland, furthering your desire to investigate the other remaining counties situated north of Ireland. This book is a must read and if you are only to ever read one book on the situation in Northern Ireland, well this is it."
5,Circulon Round Grill Pan,"I absolutely love this grill pan. I have made hot dogs, hamburgers, grilled cheeses and even eggplant in it and it is great. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a grill pan.It also is easy to clean with just a little soap and water.Thank you,"
4,"Good product, a little shakey","The product is easy to mount, though vibrates a little on the ends which I hope don't hurt it's longevity. Amazon was slow to ship though, the item received a tracking number immediately but didn't leave their warehouse for over a week."
3,"extra tracks, but not an album","Half of these songs are from the ""EB 84"" album. Buy this title for the songs not included from that."
1,Bad Seller,Paid for the product but never received it! Have tried to contact the seller twice and had no response. WARNING!!!!
5,Book Ordered/Great Price,Rec'd book on time; cheaper than area bookstores. This is not the first time I purchased items from Amazon and I plan to continue. Great job! Thanks!
1,In the memory of a free festival,"My recollection of this flick is hazy. I saw it late night in the London West End as part of the National Film Festival. There was no one on the door so I just sat down without paying. Niavely I assumed film festivals must be free. Good old fashioned British incompetence was the more likely culprit.After a promising start it became apparent that George had decided to eschew his auteur style in favour of a strange hybrid of Hitchcock homage and Russ Meyer. That may make it sound more colourful than the laughable and undistinguished results. At one point during the interminable proceedings I recognised a borrowed speech from Doctor Logan in 'Day of the Dead' about civilization that seemed extraneous.Romero is a talented director who is either 'on' or 'off' and when he's off, the results are invariably puzzling. Despite its appearence at the festival, no further Monkey Business was seen at the local multiplexes which was probably a blessing for the old boy."
4,Holy Monkey!,"This was the funniest movie I have ever seen and should definitely be re-released in the movie theaters so the younger generations can experience the wonderful tale of ""Monkey Shines."" While select scenes are a tad on the vulger side (a.k.a. the sex scene--what was that!?)the rest of the movie is burned in my mind forever as the best movie ever to play in the theater.P.S.-Shout out to the swim team-I know all of you truly love ""Monkey Shines"""
5,The greatest movie since Tremors,"I was blown away by this movie. This is a very artsey movie and the screen play is fantastic. I laughed through a lot of the movie, but it was filled with suspense. I recommened this movie to everyone, it is a great movie. Yale is better then Harvard Will, yes it is."
5,Monkey Shines,"From a purely animal training perspective this movie is brilliant. Romero did a great job directing these 6, 10 pounds capuchin monkeys to look like 1 monkey did the job. Much harder than Lassie and Flipper.The editing was also very slick. Watch the movie from a technical POV and see if you can find the different monkey faces, bodies and also puppets used in the more intense scenes.I trained them all and was very proud of them."
3,Monkey Business,"Monkey Shines works well as a film, though due to its outlandish premise it does require a small suspension of belief. I mean, 'a pint sized monkey murdering people'!? Yet by the end of the film, it all comes off believable and unforced.George A. Romero has crafted a very gripping and morbid tale of a paralyzed man's connection with a helper monkey, which evolves in quite a sinister unfolding. The film takes a while to build up to it's abnormal premise, but the third act is truly the best part of the film when we are faced with all sorts of mayhem and debauchery. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, but my only problem is with the first half of the film, which feels and comes off almost like a Lifetime channel movie. Despite that, Monkey Shines executes as an unpredictable and thrilling chiller."
2,"Poor plot, cute monkey though!","I rented this movie expecting tons of gore, but no! NONE! This movie had a poor plot, poor acting, but the monkey was cute. Try to avoid renting this movie, it's just a time-waster."
2,Opus who????,"The cover of this books claims it is an ""objective look"" -- however, I did not find that to be the case. Mr. Allen appears to be too willing to accept the spoon fed answers he receives from Opus Dei spokespersons as fact. I really wish he would have pushed the envelope just a little harder in this instance. I got the impression that he was writing an annual report for a multi-national corporation. Frankly, it appears that this ""association of Catholics who seek personal Christian perfection"" are following the example of IBM instead of Jesus Christ."
3,Mostly balanced and well written -- but leaves one wondering,"No doubt this is a mostly balanced and well written book; the author certainly did his footwork.My only complaint is that just when he delves into more meaty criticism he seems to pull back each time and say ""Oh, that's just what SOME people think but EVERYONE else LOVES Opus Dei."" This approach left me wondering if the author is as impartial/fair as he proclaims to be.I would recommend reading the book with a critical bent; it isn't until the end that the author really tries to say that Opus Dei has some faults and could do better."
5,I enjoyed reading it...,"Interesting book that answered many questions for me. Being a new Catholic, I was curious about Opus Dei and this book gave me insight."
2,Another WHITEWASH of the CORROSIVE NARCISSISTIC Cult of Opus Dei,"Q: Why no negative reviews for this piffle of a book???A: Because the sad Opusdeinistas petition AMAZON to remove them.A friend of mine recently wrote an excellent review for this book. It was removed within 24 hours due to petitions by Opus Dei. I won't go into details of ODs sad maneuverings: suffice it to say there are at least two books that are proper and authorative reports on Opus Dei which can be purchased from AMAZON, they are'Opus Dei: An Investigation into the Powerful Secretive Society within the Catholic Church'byMICHAEL WALSH'Saints and Schemers: Opus Dei and Its Paradoxes'byJOAN ESTRUCH'Their Kingdom Come : Inside the Secret World of Opus Dei'byROBERT HUTCHISON."
2,Opus Dei : A Pathetic Look at a Needful Nest of Narcissists,"The ever so punctilious Fr. John Flader (rhymes with bladder) O.Dei., said recently on Australian national television, that the Opus particularly likes to target the weak willed. Looks like the luvley Fr. John recruited John-L-Allen-Jr personally. How else does one explain such heroic moments of journalism as:""....there are two Opus Deis, an Opus Dei of reality and an Opus Dei of myth.....most of these myths grew from a misinterpretation of Opus Dei's newness"" !!!"
2,Hagiography,"Utterly disappointing. No real warts or blemishes uncovered. Indeed, Opus Dei should be overjoyed with this book, that promises much, but doesn't deliver."
1,I don't rate this cd because it doesn't deserve a rate,"I awaited a long time for the release of the Thomas Otten second cd. The first cd is a wonderfull cd, it is a work like no one I have ever heard before.This second work is a totally mess, a waist of time.I wonder if it was written, composed and sung by the same people of the first one.Don't buy it if you liked Close To Silence.Don't buy it at all!"
1,So-o-o-o-o Disappointed,"After being brought to my knees,(literally) by Thomas Otten's first album, Close to Silence, I could barely wait until his next release. I found Portraits to be extremely disappointing. I felt much of his vocals on this release were forced and I kept getting the feeling throughout the CD that this was rushed to press. I don't feel this CD came from the same place/space as his first. Hopefully his future endeavors will be able to ""capture"" the message I clearly heard/felt in his first."
3,He is Gorgeous,"Okay, so the book isn't that well written. It's pretty bland and is organized a bit confusingly.But, then again, there are gorgeous pictures of a gorgeous man, and we get to learn about his life, so do we really care about the literary content?Nope.If you love Johnny Depp and just want to learn some more facts about him (and look at lots of good pictures of him!), you'll enjoy this. But if you're looking for a biography that's a good read, this isn't it. Go read...something else that isn't this.;-)"
2,Misses The Mark,"I enjoy the music but Linda's voice does not cut it singing these types of songs. These were torch songs, she sings them like an opera singer. I enjoy the CD as back ground music, but please don't compare these tracks to Ella, Sinatra and the rest.Nice CD...but not up to the standards by a long shot. But I give her credit for trying."
2,..What was she thinkin'..!,"..Even the cover stinks..looking bored while her lover is making advances..She's singing your grandparents music..Ecch..Reunite with the Stone Ponys..!..Course she retired to Arizona..Just as well..she had a great career till this..Just sits at home, looking in the mailbox for royalty checks..Skip this mess unless you come home from the factory, shower & slip into a tuxedo and sip a dirty martini..while entertaining your grandma..(who looks like shes been in the basement of Psycho..!)..Cheers."
5,Fabulous music,"My CD arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I owned this complete collection years ago when it came out on tape and someone had taken it from my home. I was thrilled to find it here on CD and will be purchasing the other two in the near future. I have never heard anyone cover these songs as well as Linda Ronstadt did when she performed this music with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. There is nothing as beautiful as great lyrics with a simple, yet perfect melody. I have been singing along for the past three weeks in my car."
4,This cd was a brilliant effort on the part of Linda,"To please everyone out there with a cd is impossible. Some will like one kind of music and others will not. I'm happy to say that I am one of the people that loves this kind of music. This music is terrific.There were a lot of bright spots for this cd. To begin with we need to look first a Lindas' voice. Linda did a good job with this crossover project. Her voice is not custom made for this kind of venue, but she did a good job learing how to be a torch singer. She really made these songs sound fresh and new again.Nelson Riddle showed that he still is the man with the golden touch. He really came up some top notch arrangements. Nelson assembled a who's who of musicians to play in the orchestra. There were many brilliant solos performed on this cd.In conclusion, I would say that this cd came within a wisker of being great. It definately will be remembered as a classic."
5,kmba,This is a magnificent collaboration between Linda Ronstadt and Nelson Riddle. Her interpretations of the songs are impeccable and his arranngements are just perfect.I never get tired of listening to this
4,The Fashion World of Beauty,"I enjoyed peeking into the world of fashion. And who better would it be but Anna Wintour's world. I've always wondered what it was like behind the scenes of the editor and her many, many employees. To have a successful magazine like Vogue you have to eat, drink & sleep Vogue all the time. I enjoyed watching this film very much. I highly recommend seeing this especially if you are interested in joining the world of fashion."
2,Surprisingly Boring-Anna W Colorless-Endless Meetings,"I suppose if you want a real life look into the putting together of a fashion magazine this might be the movie for you. If you also happen to love film though, be warned, this documentary is like watching paint dry. There is nothing glamorous about putting together Vogue magazine. The endless meetings involved are mind numbing. If I am going to watch fashion, I would prefer watching the raw creativity of the project runway entrants who are actually trying to create something. If Anna W was really the inspiration for Meryl Streep's character in the DEVIL WEARS PRADA, you would never know it from this film. She is drab and colorless. If you are expecting an interesting personality like Karl Lagerfeld (from his documentary), abandon all hope! I think this might be a real good film for someone to see who wants a job editing a fashion magazine as it operates at a real life pace and spares you nothing of the day to day detail of working there."
4,I love this movie,"I can't get enough of fashion, vogue magazine, etc. This is a cool glance into the world I work in. It is candid, fun, and shows how the biggest fashion magazine creates their biggest issue. If you are fashion girl then you will love this movie"
3,Interesting,Seems like the devil wears prada wasn't too far off. Interesting movie but could've been better-wasn't sure why it was made and what the teller was trying to say.
3,I really don't get the point,"Vogue is a fashion magazine. Anna Wintour is the editor-in-chief. She seems to call the shots, vetoing other people's inputs. She's not nice but doesn't have to be because she is the top dog. But all in all, what's the point? Fashion can be fun, some of the magazine pictures are beautiful and silly, but this designer wear costs thousands of dollars that most of us can't afford to buy. Sure, I browse through Vogue sometimes, but I never lose sight of the fact that fashion is just clothing.It's kind of strange to see that these are the tastemakers because I don't necessarily think they have the best eye or taste, and fashion is supposed to be subjective.I'm not sure I learned anything from this documentary. I enjoy beautiful textures, fabrics, and looking at nice clothing but it's almost like the fashion world is a bubble.My favorite person in the documentary was Grace Coddington, she just seemed more down-to-earth, relatable, and approachable."
3,Compare and Contrast with other fashion documentaries,"I saw three fashion documentaries, Wintor, Valentino, Lagerfeld. To be Honest, the Valentino is the best one, no wonder it made the short list for the oscars...The September Issue was rush and rush throughout the movie. Lagerfeld the person is great, but the documentary just was too slow waiting for Lagerfeld's every move."
3,boring?,"I might have expected a lot of reactions to these characters, but boring wasn't one of them. In the end, we learn that beneath all the glamour an office is an office. I have more colorful characters in my own office than these rather banal folks who are doing a rather banal job like everybody else. Ms. Wintour may have been playing to the camera, but her reactions to different situations seemed reasonable. Certainly not over the top by any stretch, even when she disapproved. Nobody seemed afraid to tell her no or to fight back against her wishes or to interject their own opinions in her presence. Given all the hype around this woman, I would have expected less bravado on their parts.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film was the obvious insecurity she felt for being the idol of millions, yet never earning the respect of her own family with what they see as her frivolous career choice. There was genuine sadness behind those laughs."
3,For Afficionados Only,"As a male, not particularly attuned to female fashion, I did appreciate and enjoy watching the hard work, energy and creativity that apparently goes into producing a world-reknowned womens' magazine. Yes, there are some pretty interesting moments. But unless you are truly a fashion afficionado (or someone interested in photography and/or mass communications), you probably aren't going to embrace this film as a thrilling cinematic experience."
2,Boring,"The video seemed less about the fashion than about who is afraid of Anna, who seems like a business woman trying to do her job while those around her moan about her not being warm & fuzzy. It all got old after 30 minutes or so."
3,Dear Anna,"I saw this film at the local theater when it was released. I thought it was interesting until I saw Anna's interview with David Letterman. Well, Anna Wintour has as much personality as a mosquito...small and annoying (not to mention she looks like one with her Bob hair duo and sunglasses). She really showed how irrelevant she could be."
3,"Dull people, dull movie","Most of us don't really care for the world of high fashion, but it at least sparks our curiosity, which is why I personally watched this movie.To my surprise, I found that these people are actually rather dull. Or more precisely, they're narrow and shallow, because their lives revolve around fashion and they exemplify the ideology that beauty is skin/clothes deep. Making matters worse, because high fashion is tied with the elite world of conspicuous wealth, the people at Vogue also exhibit a crassly business mindset, thus compromising whatever purely artistic motives and pretensions they might have.The dullness of these people also makes for a dull movie, so I struggled to finish it. But at least the movie is honest in presenting this dullness, rather than resorting to the standard approach of overglamorizing the fashion world, so I can at least give this movie three stars for that, though I still can't recommend it."
3,Book club choice,Book kept me guessing. Not sure I would reccomend it. However enjoyed David Guterson's as a writter. Enhanced my volcabulary.
4,Simple and beautiful,"David Guterson's first novel, ""Snow Falling on Cedars"", was an absolute triumph and it was a natural evil that whatever he wrote next would not live up to it in peoples' eyes.""Our Lady of the River"", however, is unfairly demonized. It is a simple, beautiful story, about a young stoner girl who sees the Virgin Mary, and the havoc it wreaks on those around her. Guterson - in his typical style - treats every character, large and small, as important, and focusses on the slow demise of the people whose lives are affected by the Marian sighting as it begins to have greater and greater impact throughout the town, the country and then the world.Certainly, the novel is hardly praising of Catholicism, but this cannot be considered a flaw in such a beautiful, mournful book as this one."
2,Very disappointed,"I was delighted to find this book after reading and thoroughly enjoying ""Snow Falling on Cedars"". Unfortunately, this book does not come close. There is a recurrent theme of raunchy sexual thoughts that permiate the book and add nothing to the story. A suggestion or a thought from one of the characters perhaps but we are continually bombarded by the lustful ... thoughts of the priest and the raunchy thoughts of another main character. Too much and unnecessary as were the continuous references to Anne's period and allergy problems.I was also disappointed in the ending, felt it could have been so much better. Instead of uplifting it was depressing and unsatisfying. Hopefully Mr. Guterson has another good book in him - this isn't it."
1,"Blah, blah, blah","This book started slow and trickled off to nothing. In his quest for neutrality, Guterson failed to develop a single character into someone to care about. There's a lot of run-on theological dialogues and inner monologues that neither inspire nor educate. The anticlimactic end is not worth the slogging through the forest."
2,Wince and Grit Your Teeth,"If inaccuracies spoil a book for you, pass this one by. I winced on every page as the author referred to the Virgin Mary as Mother Mary (as in the rock song)! Did you ever hear of Catholics addressing each other as Brother and Sister, or ejaculating Amens, Alleluias, and Praise The Lords? Sounds more like an evangelical tent meeting than a Marian apparition sighting to me. Nor do I know of any priests (old or young, pre- or post- Vatican II) who talk to people the way these characters do in confessions and sick visits. This has to be the worst-researched novel I've ever read."
1,Very disappointing,"This is the only novel I've ever thrown into the trash can upon completion. On the book jacket it is touted as ""inspiring."" Instead, it is a painstaking close-up of the seamiest side of human nature. I felt the time I spent reading it could have been better spent doing almost anything else."
1,"Honestly, the worst book I've read.","I struggled to get through this one. The writing is terribly long and I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and pages because they just drone on. Poor editing. Characters are completely dull and unlikeable. Don't waist your money. If you truly want to read this book, buy used from one of the many other disapointed reviewers."
1,Completely Offensive,"Was this an anti-Catholic book, or what?! I was completely disgusted by the way Guterson portrayed Catholics. After reading half the book, I actually decided that it wasn't even worth my time. It was almost as if he was too lazy to even do any research on the Catholic religion... there were times where I was saying to myself, ""What is he TALKING about??"" A lot of what he wrote was not even correct. Instead, he portrayed them as a bunch of freaks who masturbate and rape, saying prayers that in actuality don't even exist in Catholicism. If you're going to write a book about a religion, Guterson, I suggest you actually do the research first."
1,Stopped at page 129,"While David Guterson's previous book, ""Snow Falling On Cedars"" was exceptional -- it won an award -- and ""East of the Mountains"" was ok, ""Our Lady Of The Forest"" just doesn't rank with his others.My struggle to continue reading this book has come to an end because I stopped reading. The first time I stopped reading was on page 111, but later picked up the book, hoping to get to the final page. However, on page 129 I decided again, enough is enough. There just isn't enough interest and believability in the story to continue.One curious characteristic of this book is that Guterson has chosen not to use quotation marks in the dialogues, and I wonder why he left them out. Maybe that is a new trend of which I am unaware.Maybe someday I will finish the book, but not now."
4,"Troubling, but beautiful...","Was I the only reviewer who noticed that no one in the book-- not Ann's mother or grandfather, not the priest, not her ""protector"" Carolyn, not the thousands of vision-followers, not even the Virgin Mary saw Ann as a person but only as something to be consumed or used? Everyone is so self-absorbed that no one even sees Ann except the reader.Is this about Marianist vision or about the way modern American society treats its children?This was a fascinating book, but it broke my heart."
2,rain,"I bought this book after reading East of the Mountains by the same author. (I thought E of the M was outstanding) This book was well-written, but left me feeling empty. I like to read uplifting books and this one felt like the rain-drenched area of the setting of the story."
1,It's practically plagiarism,"A friend of mine lent me this book, and as soon as I saw the title, I knew it would be awful. The title is practically plagiarized from Jean Genet's 1943 masterpiece ""Our Lady of the Flowers"" and the plot is riddled with overt correlations as well. I have to say I'm surprised that any publisher would touch a book that was so obviously trying to copy a previous (and famous) work of literature, especially given that ""Our Lady of the Forest"" doesn't even come close to touching ""Our Lady of the Flowers"". If you're thinking about buying this book at all, don't. Go buy the original, which IS well written, with a wonderful introduction by Sartre."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"This book was rated 4 stars in pre-release from BOOK magazine, so I bought it, looking for a good read. Being raised in Catholic schools all this visionary stuff is intriguing. ""Our Lady of the Forest"" is in fact intriguing and difficult to put down. The ending, however, was a little too tidy for this constant reader. I did not want uplifting but I did not want tidy with everything explained and everyone in a place where they belong.Reading along with this book I enjoyed the ride and the excellent writing. Learning about the Northwest was interesting to me as well as seeing the poverty still present in this country.""Our Lady..."" is a book that makes you think I just wanted to think a little harder on the end."
2,Someone has been eating too many mushrooms,"Yuk! I am having trouble finishing this book. I had to take a break to see if I was the only one who felt this way. No, I am not, but there are also some who claim to actually enjoy this mishmash of a story.Having loved Guterson's ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" I couldn't wait to read ""Our Lady of the Forest."" If the author's name were not on the cover, I would not believe it is by the same author. I think Mr. Guterson must have been eating those magic mushrooms he talks about in the book too. His story rambles on. The lack of quotation marks makes it difficult to follow. There is not one redeeming character in the story. Although I am not quite finished, I do intend to even though it makes me feel as though I have been ""slumming."""
2,A bit boring,"Not up to the quality of his first two novels. I found the subject of this book interestinig, but the plot manipulations not equal to the subject. It just didn't seem consistent and my attention waivered. I listened to it on tape and that may have been a factor. The written word may have been the better format for this book. I would not spend money on it."
1,Author quit before the ending,"David Guterson is capable of much better writing than was evidenced in this book. While he wove an interesting and suspenseful tale, he committed the mortal sin of giving up on the ending. When authors do this, I always picture the author as being under intense pressure from the publisher to get the damn book finished. Was that the case here, or did Guterson's pathological cynicism, expressed through the book's characters, simply overcome him? What else but cynicism and a complete disregard for his readers would allow an author to tag on an ending that can only be described as a crappy copout - illogical, empty, and totally banal? If you don't mind investing hours of your time on a book only to feel like the author doesn't respect your time enough to finish the book, go ahead and read it."
2,Goes to sleep half way through,"This is no ""Snow Falling on Cedars"". The story arc peters out about half way through and the reader is left with a lot of wonderful descriptions of the rain forest, but little character development or plot. A lot of the negative reviews had to do with religious issues. I don't think the author did much more than throw around a couple of cliches about Mary worship in the Catholic church. His approach was too weak to even warrent taking offense.I found this book in the give-away bin of the local library... I put it back after I read it. It's not worth buying."
2,Long Winded,"Very disappointing. I loved reading Guterson's other novel, Snow Falling on Cedars, but this one was boring and long winded. Almost like boasting that he could use hard words and write complex sentences, words and sentences would be thrown in that could have been more concise. The book was returned to the library without even finishing it."
1,A Perfect Example of Bloated Modern Prose,"I have not read anything else by Guterson before this novel and was not familiar with his acclaim for Snow Falling on Cedars. I was ready to enjoy this novel. Guterson does great work in the first chapter to create an interesting scenario with a possibility of a vivid look at the difficulty of being religious in a postmodern society. The writing quickly turns to the bloated, repetitive prose of which many contemporary writers have been accused. There are numerous paragraphs in the text in which he rephrases the same concept over and over again within in the same sentence and throughout paragraphs. I fear for American literature if Guterson represent the new tastes of literature. Long-winded is not literary."
2,"Hard to get through, but good in the end.","Most of the time, I didn't know what kept me reading. It seemed to go on and on. The ending was good, but I'm not sure the rest of the book was worth it."
1,Blah,"I can't say much about this novel except that it had a lot of promise and didn't live up to it. The characters are intriguing at first, and then become wooden. The story sounds interesting, and then becomes boring. I also feel that many of plot lines in the story are cliche. I feel that Guterson had a great idea for a story, but didn't take the time to allow that story to reach its full potential. I know that he researched the book for a really long time, and so on the other hand, maybe he put so much effort into the research that the story lost its human side. Guterson is a great writer, but this is not a good book."
4,Our Lady of the Forest,"At first I thought it was a loser. Who wants to read about an asthmatic mushroom picking waif masturbating in a rain drenched forest next to a god forsaken logging town? But then, Guterson pulls you into his modern legend of lost souls: the visionary, pill popping Ann, the self-loathing ex logger Tom Cross, the self-centered wanderer Christine Greer, & the sincerely fallible Father Collins. Guterson documents today's thirst for religion and redemption with passion & insight. This isn't as magical as Snow Falling on Cedars or uplifting as East of the Mountain. But our Lady definitely succeeds in raising questions about where are we going, why are we here, and what we are doing to our sacred places. Suddenly, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is a homeless, abused child whose search for meaning results in environmental disaster and yet another church. There's no happy ending, and that's the Truth."
2,Our Forest of the Lady,"As a great fan of Guterson's previous novels, I was eager to read ""Our Lady of the Forest."" Page by page, the book has elements that please, particularly the descriptive treatment of the forest community and Guterson's literate dialog. But ultimately the book fails to satisfy.Ostensibly, the theme is the personal struggle to come to terms with religious experience. But Guterson makes it clear through this book that he has no first-hand religious experience to draw upon: no anguish of soul, no conversion, no sense of devotion, no spiritual witness, and ultimately no faith. We're left with a portrayal of Christianity so lifeless and banal that it might have been pieced together from NPR talk-shows.Please, Mr. Guterson, inform your next novel from your own experience, and people it with folks that you really know."
2,Overpriced....,"Works as intended, but am dissatisfied with the quality -- very flimsy material for the price. $20 seems more reasonable."
3,Average,This album starts off with two really great songs but after that the only other good one is Gods of Wrath. The rest of the album is just mindless filler.
5,Essential 4.6,"Metal Church never got huge, but this CD sold well. 85 was a good year for thrash/Metal in general, and this CD is near the top of the heap! The first 4 tracks flow perfectly. The production and mix still sound good today (nearly 25 years later). The follow up 'The Dark' was good as well, but this is their best CD.Only complaint is that is so short. Only 8 tracks (excluding Highway Star cover). This is a classic and a good representation of a great time in metal."
2,SilverStone2 East Main 11 inch Skillet,"It was dirty, but otherwise it is fine. Handle does not match others from same company."
4,Nice Mug - Not So Nice Price,This mug is nice and cute and durable - the color is even and matches well with the other cinnabar items I have. I just found it extremely pricey for what you get.
4,thunder and pain,a wonder the first half and a complete run down the second. these guys got lazy habits at times. kewl;
3,a middling review,"Well, I liked the story idea. Two meteors are heading towards Earth and one, the sneaky one hiding behind the first, is on a collision course with our Planet! Will anyone listen? No, of course not. Except one scientist who resigned from the military, coming out as a gay man in the process. Yes, there still isn't any place for a gay man in the service...but all is not lost, he will still have his chance to save the day. And the Earth. A nice thought. The acting was fair. The two actors playing gay were a touch awkward with each other, though very handsome. I wished fervently for more obvious intimacy between them, after all they are seriously involved, right? Well, at least an attempt is being made to have a heroic gay couple. Both actors are very mascluine, not parodies, for once. I only wish they were more comfortable with each other. So it depends what you like."
2,Gay opening scenes in the US but not in other countries,"Made for the gay Here! cable network, the opening scenes of Deadly Skies show the principal characters in a gay relationship that is then not referenced again as the drama unfolds. Other countries (Canada, UK) have a shorter film without the gay scenes. Like Dante's Cove on the same network, the gay scenes are, I guess, suppose to excuse the limited scope of the plot and the acting. Unfortunately they don't."
3,Title doesnt Match emotion in movie,"OK, Basically the movie was entertaining but it was more like a movie of the week on TV. The acting was pretty weak. And there was an undertone of a gay theme. Unfortunaetly it didnt to be there. It had no impact in the movie at all."
1,poor,"This group could sing, but that is about it.Here Come The Doddletown Pipers basically takes 60s pop--Hard Day's Night, other top 40 of the time, and turns them into Lawence Welk. I am not exagerating when I say this. This is not a metephore. This is how it sounds.I guess this is an attempt to sell ready made hits to old ladies, in the 1960s, when 70 was not the new 50, it was the old 70, and your hair was blue.This sucksHere Come The Doddletown Pipers...................and there they go"
3,Acoustic redo of 80s hair rock,"You have to dig hearing these classics in a fresh version. Accept's Balls to the Wall is just haunting. One major oversight is Firehouse's When I Look into Your Eyes, that was a repeat from Vol.1 and makes this lose a star."
3,Beware of non-stick coating scratching off the saucepan lip,"Not only is this a good buy. It is also very pratical for those who have small kitchens and are short of space. My only complaint is that the non-stick coating on the lip of the saucepan gets scratched off over time by the edge of the omlette pan as is rests there during everyday use. The edge of these pans are not covered by enamel, possibly to prevent chipping or to let the cast iron show thru. It is this edge that gradually scratches off the finish of the the saucepan when they are used togetherAs the scratches are only on the lip of the saucepan and not where anything cooking would touch it, I would still recommend this pan."
5,It's the best combi,"I bought this since I got such a great deal. My hubby was a little mad on my impulse buy but now he is converted. He loves it to death. Its the only pan that he uses. He loves to cook Thai and Indian on this, the slow cooking on this is the best. We rarely use the omelet cover but it has been used and the nonstick is great. Nothing ever sticks on it. If you can, BUY IT!! I have another Creuset, a bigger one and this is the one I and now him always reach for."
4,Pretty Nice,"I bought this album for one song, Oh No with Mos Def and Phraoh monche and ended up liking the majority of the album. My BIGGEST beef is the large number of empty tracks between 17 and 38...what the heck is that about? I'm really glad the album showcases some of the lesser known artists like Words(worth), Consquence and Menace, and Saukrates. My favorite beat is from the Alchemist on Right and Exact, the oriental sound is ON FIRE. Pick up this album is you have some extra cash and want some hot beats and a nice mix of artists"
2,Rawkus - what happened here?,After a long wait for this CD putting it in my stereo I only found a few decent songs. It is quite a shame that this CD doesnt match the long hard work of Rawkus and their well known rep. This one is definately not worth buying so save up for something that has that little extra. Lyricist Lounge 2 is a low blow for Rawkus and could have most certainly done better; there is plenty more room for improvement.
4,Could be better,"overall the album was pretty good with a couple flaws like having nate dogg n jt money on the album. the lyricist lounge started out in a basement in new york where underground artists would go to show case there skills, so it made no sence to have those two on their. i was also looking foward to hearing a track from thirstin howll III since he has always been a big part of the lyricist lounge but i was upset when he was not on the album. but a majority of the tracks are good and the big l song that replaced the rza/last emporer song is dope. this album is gonna get alot of play from me and i cant wait untill soundbombing 3 comes out."
1,Mos and Kweli,"I would point the potential purchaser of this album in the direction of Blackstar, and Internal Affairs, The album would have done well to include more Monch and Kweli, in fact seeing as how Mos, Kweli, Monch, and MOP are the only good rappers to even appear on the album I wouldn't even bother Buying the compilation"
4,Real Hip Hop!!,"Yes, you are now about to be surrounded by the sounds of real hip hop. I will admit, I was not motivated to purchase this CD at first because the collabs. did not look great. However, upon purchase, I was greatly surprised. My favorite song is ""The Grimy Way"" with the QB MCs. ""I've Committed A Murder"" is a great song too. Here we have Mos Def and Macy Gray over a primo beat. It gets no better than this. I did not like the Dialated People cut too much because I don't are for them. If I had to compare this album to the first Lyricist's Lounge, I would say that the first was better. That's not to say that this is not a dope album, but there were more unknown hungry artists on the first. If you are in search for the real hip hop, look no further than this album."
2,What happened Rawkus?,"This is absolute cr@p! I was very disappointed with this release.Sorry,I got to give a history lesson. Check out the the first L.L. joint and you'll notice EcKo Unl.(the clothes) did the artwork. Ok,Ecko used to give out tapes with their T-shirts when thier clothes were about graffiti the tapes were called Underground Airplay,not sold seperately.Biggie,Mos def(utd),madskillz,8off,lord have mercy heard for the first time on these tapes.Lyricist Lounge was born of new,unsigned, hungry MCs not cats that are already flashing ice. Rawkus you lost your direction. OH NO! People Know."
2,Required reading for IC class,"I am taking a Interpersonal Communications class right now, and wasn't familiar with what this meant, so I was curious about the book, as it is required reading. Wow. The author does make a lot of assumptions about cultural differences and relationships. She doesn't cover the aspects of miscommunication or disfunctional communication (not much anyway). And really, this whole subject is as clear as mud for me. Ms. Wood attempts to explain and define one subject, but her explanation requires a dictionary to decifer it! I would not recommend this book for this type of class."
2,Not a reader friendly book.,"Ms. Wood is intelligent and provides a lot of good information in this textbook. This was chosen for the course I teach before I took the position and if I had my way, we would have found a different book. It is not that the information is bad, it is just that Ms. Wood becomes very repetitive. About half of the first six chapters seem to drag on and most of the time restates the same thing from an earlier chapter or from the same chapter. I like what she has done with discussing multicultural issues, but some of it seems to be patronizing to the reader. I think another edition should be done and making the chapters shorter and more readable (Chapter 1 goes on for 78 pages -- which lost my attention, so I know my students had the same problem.) In the course review, the textbook generally gets a poor or below average rating. I can not give you a recommendation, as I am in the middle of searching for a better option."
3,"Valuable, but tedious","This text was required reading for an interpersonal communications course I took. It provided a ton of valuable information, very helpful insight, sample conversations, and examples which helped me to acctually apply what was learned. However, the writing style was highly repetitive, and each new section repeated earlier ones then built on them instead of starting with completely new information. While this did help me learn better, it was also somewhat boring. I would still recommend this book for it's ability to make abstract terms much more tangible. Hope this helps!"
3,Dense and a bit dry,"The textbook's got lots of good information and detail, but there's a lot of necessary/excessive word usage throughout the chapters.- I'd prefer that the textbook company would simplify their words and make it brief, especially since this is a communications book- Good value though!"
2,Not as advertised,This shovel is advertised as being by Ames True Temper. It is a Jackson brand that is made in India and distributed by Ames
5,This is a really great one,"I loved this book. Andy has a great grasp on College and what a first year hall is all about. The details and ways that he portrays the character are accurate, deep, multidimensional and compelling. This book was recommended to me by a friend and I recommend it to anyone, college or not."
5,Breathtaking,"An amazing and harrowing tale of a young man who takes it upon himself to save the kingdom from certain death. I found the story fast-paced and never lacking in detail. Even though it is the third in a series (and I certainly want to read the first two!), it can be read alone. A richly woven story full of sights, smells and characters that won't soon be forgotten, this is one historical novel that should delight both girls and boys alike. Telemakos is a hero that we can all feel for."
3,Almost Paradise,"Grover Washington Jr.'s first album for Elektra Records is middling affair. It's a good album, it just lacks the immediate spark of his previous efforts. The best track is ""Shana"" which has a haunting melody."
3,"Good, but not Great","From a western vampire-film fan who does not know a great deal about Taoism or Chinese folklore, I would say that this film is funny and entertaining but not nearly as good as the first one. The plot is interesting, the special effects are competent, there's a lot of neat ""Taoist magic"" moments, there's a few cool stunts, and the acting overall is good (considering this film is intended to be goofy); nevertheless, Mr. Vampire 3 just doesn't deliver as well as Mr Vampire 1. My two biggest complaints are that the apprentices in this installment are not as likeable or as believable as the first film's duo, and the pacing isn't nearly as good. This latter may not sound like a big problem, but in a film whose major appeal lies in suspense and humour, it really is.In sum: if you liked the first film, you'll probably like this one too, but it feels very much like a sequel (if you know what I mean)."
1,Doesn't Fit,"Way too small for a Kia Sorento 2012. I wish prior to purchase that somewhere there were specs to say steering wheel size. Another thing was I had to air it out. The new ""leather"" or plastic smell was horrible!!!! I'm sad it didn't fit because it did look like it was made of great quality once the smell went away."
2,doesn't fit,Bought this as a gift. We cannot get it to fit a Chrysler Town and Country steering wheel. Are we doing something wrong? Love the steering wheel cover and really wish we could get it to fit. Any suggestions.
1,Stinky Steering wheel Cover,The product smelled so bad when I opened the box that I had to leave it outside.
5,Yankee steering wheel cover,"I thought the product was exactly as ""advertised"". The product was received in a very short period of time, and the item was packaged very carefully. I would buy from this retailer again."
5,Nice Gift,"This was an excellant gift for Father's Day. The cover went on a Mazda. Getting it on the steering wheel was no different than any other steering wheel cover. A little tight, but that's the way it should be. Nice leather feel, with the NY Yankees emblem stamped on to the leather cover. The hubby just loves it. Better than a tie !!!"
5,Great quality,Bought as a gift for the hubby. Fits perfect. Leather is really soft and not thin like cheaper ones. Exactly what I hoped it would be for the price.
3,Dr smack,This worked Xmas day and after that it didnt work at all. I dont know if we got a lemon or what. Waiting to hear.
5,Makes Gaming More Fun,"Whenever I used this, it made gaming more fun and created some funny conversations. It can be a bit annoying sometimes if you're trying to use it while playing fast paced games like Call of Duty. It's really simple to use and doesn't really add too much weight to the controller. I didn't use it all the time but when I did, it was worth the purchase."
2,"Meh, Its alright",The price is good compared to the one made by Datel but doesnt have as many recordings and it breaks to easily compared to Trash Talk by Datel.I would recommend the Datel Trash Talk even though it costs more it lasts longer and can put even more recordings and doesnt require batteries.
3,an fun little toy,"very simple easy to use, but use with care, the playback over the xbox network is rough, and a lot people complain."
4,Thank you =),Shipped fast =) Thank you so much. I was worried it wasn't gonna work for what I wanted it for but it does.
5,"Smack talkin' like a pro, DAWG","Jesus, this thing is amazing if you use it the right way. You can completely catch people off guard using this thing and have an incredibly entertaining time with some creativity plus the right party of people. Check this weird video out to see how it's done when in the right hands [...]"
3,Works but cheaply constructed,"For the price, this little device is well worth it. I used mine for about a week with no problem, but on the second week the smacktalk wouldn't record sounds properly. I tried for hours to see what the problem was, and eventually gave up. On week 4 I picked it up again and it worked great. Then I stepped on it and it cracked. It still works though I must hold it in place, so I don't even bother. But I had a lot of fun annoying my friends over xbox with this. Worth the price but cheaply made."
3,Fun to a point but annoying overall.,This thing can be fun but overall its makes other players mad. Its bad enough hearing little kids over xbox live but try playing against someone with one of these hearing the same clips over and over during a game...A guaranteed way to get your rep rating lower but if you enjoy being annoying during gaming get this
3,You get what you pay for...,"It does what it's supposed to do. Although...People gave me reports that my mic was echoing when I was using this so I stopped using it but. It's cheap, u get what you pay for."
3,"Only good for $5 with shipping, not worth a penny more!","I thought the smack talk would be awesome. but it is notProsEasy to use and record,Sound Clips of 5 seconds, Sometimes I can get almost 7 seconds.Auto Shut off feature so you do not drain batteries.not too bulky attaches to the controller just fine.excellent sound playback in headset.Cons.Just because it sounds great in your headset does not mean it sounds good over live, I tested it online by sending voice messages and it sounds crappy, If your recordings are normal talking volume it sounds ok, If you record music clips or loud talking or loud noises it sounds really choppy to the point where you can not make it out at all.Uses 3 AAA batteries.If this item was more then $5 with shipping I would give it 2 stars."
1,Smack talk,"I got this, and it didn't even work. I mean seriously? I made sure batteries and everything was right, no light, no nothing. Its pure trash"
3,Very nice?,"Pretty neat. I still haven't found out how to work it, or perhaps it's not working. But it's fine.Thanks."
1,Poor Customer Service,I contacted the vendor for help/assistance in regards to a problem I was having. The Support from the company was lacking. If I had known that I would not received the help I would have looked elsewhere. I do not recommend the vendor.
2,I Finally Gave Up on this Convoluted Bloatware,"This product is pretty much the worst piece of software I've ever used. It was constantly complaining that it couldn't connect to the backup server, which required constant intervention. Also, I hated the fact that the backup files were only intelligible to the program itself. I finally gave up and purchased a Seagate USB drive that comes bundled with a great little utility called BounceBack. It works 100 times better than this product."
4,Bill Kirchen's Tombstone Every Mile,"I bought the CD to basically complete my collection. This CD is no longer produced. I like hearing the original, or CD, versions of some of the songs I hear him play live. Bill Kirchen is an awesome musician to see live; he is always entertaining and puts on an enjoyable show."
1,Don't bother buying it.,"OK, I found out that this didn't fit my detector (Ace 250), which I would have known if I had read the other reviews. That wouldn't have mattered if...The thing were well made. I assumed that since it was made by Garrett that it would be well made, but the zipper stuck on first go and then broke 5 minutes after getting it out of the package.That said, I am returning it and won't bother replacing it.This is one accessory that you could probably save money by not getting in the first place.I'm surprised Garrett would let their name be on this thing it's such poor quality. Points to Garrett for at least being responsive about the quality issue of this bag, but they should definitely redesign it so it fits their detectors and doesn't break.After all, it does have the Garrett name on it!"
1,useless trash,"I'm not even sure where to start... well,its Not a back pack. Its a carrying case with handles and a shoulder strap. the strap is uncomfortable, skinny, and way too long for even a large human male. The damn thing doesn't fit my detector without breaking it down. After breaking it down the battery pack and headphones don't fit in the pockets. I almost lost my battery pack and control unit on the trail because they fell out of the way too small unable to zip pouch. My fishing poles may fit, if I keep it. at this point Im so frustrated I want nothing to do with garrett, optics planet, OR Amazon. Don't waste your money."
2,Not good,I stored my Ace 250 in this carry bag. I found it to be very cramped. The bag has very little room to spare. The zipper is poor quality and broke within a year of owning the bag. I wouldn't buy another.
2,Disappointed,"Purchased the Garrett Metal Detector bag a few days ago. Very disappointed with the bag. My Garrett Ace 250 metal detector is 44"" long on the shortest lenght. The bag is only 42"" long. The metal detector is too long for the bag. Guess it would fit if I was to take it apart but....that seems silly & useless. Would not have purchased the bag if I would have known it wouldn't fit unless I took the metal detector apart. What a rip off!Update...I would like to say that the company stands behind it's product. They emailed a response on my review and was very concerned that I was disappointed with the bag. The company made things right and in this day and time that very seldom happens. Most of the time it's all about selling the product. But not this company. It is important to them that the customer is satisfied. I must say, I am satisfied now."
3,Mutl-puripose bag,"Nice, but u got too break down the meatal dector. I thought it would fit in case without taking apart, just a thought before you buy one..."
3,Does the job,"I does its job, keeps the dust off the machine. It is a little tight for the machine. You have to collapse the detector in order to squeeze it into this bag. There are a couple pockets to put your ear buds in. I purchased an additional utility bag to keep spare batteries, gloves, belt, recovery pouch, pointer, bug spray etc. to grab when using the machine. I only use this for winter storage."
4,nice heavy duty bag,I gave it a 4star rating since I was expecting a cheaper bag and got a bag actually worth the price. very happy.
5,Absolutely pleased,This bag is a must have for your Garrett Detector. There are pouches and pocketsfor every accessory you would ever want to carry. It is made of a tough material that will last a lifetime.
2,Bag too short.,We ordered this bag when we ordered the Garrett Ace 150 detector. I wish the bag were bigger. You need to take the detector apart every time you put it away. Even shortening the detector the whole way is not enough. They could've made the bag just few inches longer and it would have made the difference.
3,Garrett,I ordered this to go with the Garrett Metal Detector I bought my husband. It seems to fit it fine.
1,Poor customer service,"I ordered a roll of paper and 2 ink cartridges from Amazon, which used Antonline.com to fulfill the orders. The e-mail notice of products shipped did not list the items, only the tracking number, although it said: ""The following item(s) from your order number xxxxxxxxx have shipped. You will receive them shortly."" Order was placed on 9/17, 2 packages (contents unlisted) shipped on 9/19, 1 arrived 9/22 and the other on 9/25. When I contacted customer support to inquire about the third item which did not arrive with the other cartridge, I was told that it had been damaged in transit and they were submitting a claim to the insurer. When I asked for the cartridge to be shipped overnight they declined. Nine days after placing the order, I still do not have the cartridge. I will not order anything from this company again."
5,"Grand Canyon:beauty, history,culture through amazing photog","What an experience! I learned so much about the Canyon, the Native American culture, all while watching absolutely beautiful photography of one of the amazing wonders of the world. This video is more than just a ""What to do at the Park"". It encapsulates the history, development and beauty of a place rightly called ""The Grand Canyon."" Buy this video if you are planning a trip, have been to the Park, or even if you've only dreamed of visiting this historical National beauty."
2,"Looks great, works okay",The peeleer works okay. Ended up using my older one because it has more flexibility. This felt like using a shaving razor on vegetables.
3,A good dictionary for intensive modern Hebrew students,I'm in 4th grade at a Jewish day school & I like this dictionary because it tells me all the masculine and feminine stuff and it is easy to read.
3,An old dictionary reprinted,"Good overall dictionary, but merely a reprint of a 1975 dictionary. Does not include a lot of words added since then to the Hebrew language. Needs an update."
1,poor condition,"The book I ordered was a Hebrew Dictionary. The pages were yellowed, pages bent, and the cover was bent as well. I think the book should have been 50 cents."
2,Limited use.,Buyer beware. This dictionary is of limited usefulness as the Hebrew words are spelled in Hebrew characters only.
4,Beginners Dead Sea Scrolls,"I was just learning about the Dead Sea Scrolls when I first read this book, and I must say, I found it an intriguing and informative source of information. It was easy to understand and provided me with valuable information. This is a great book for virtually any age--young or old, who is intersted in learning about, or expanding their knolwedge of, the Dead Sea Scrolls."
1,Not for truth seeker IMO,"First off i am not religious but i do enjoy learning about all religions and myth. I could not get through the book for i felt the bias swayed it far to much to propaganda. To be honest i am just starting to learn about the scrolls and the survival of such writings is always fantastic but early in the book he used the words about the carbon dating Nice try guys as if the scientists were plotting against him. Yes science can be wrong but give a good reason why you think it is so i can research myself, anyway that was where my interest in this book started to wane"
3,Revisionist history,"Disappointing. Promoted as scholarship, the inherent bias soon becomes apparent - Christian spin doctoring promoting the Scrolls as a prophetic precursor and validation of the Jesus story. The glaring and logical question, however, is; did the later writers of the narrative Gospels use available contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls to pen their accounts? How? As Christian revisionist history, don't expect this to be considered. An interesting story though, but don't expect an unbiased account or a scholar's insight."
1,A poor excuse for literature,"I totally agree with the reader from Los Angeles, The book is written very poorly, Hanson comes across as being a pompous jerk In addition I can actually say I dozed off on numerous occasions while reading the book"
2,DOES NOT FIT A LEXUS RX330,THE OPENING ON THIS DEVICE IS TOO SMALL FOR THE GAS CAP ON A 2005 LEXUS RX330. SO IT DOESN'T WORK AS ADVERTISEDArnold Christenson
5,"""Psyc"" me out","I actually get very surprised when Sony comes out with a new ""Psyc"" cd player design every year because of the improvements that Sony makes. This year, the design is more thinner and is more of a circle shape with the buttons on top of the cd player rather than on the side. The best part is the new addition of the attached remote control so you can change the tracks while it's in your pocket.This new design is great and I have not had any problems with it at all. This year I think Sony made the ""Psyc"" cd player pocket friendly so that you wouldn't have to hold it in your hand because the cd does not skip while it's playing in your pocket. One more thing to mention, it's a very good price for an excellent cd player!"
3,A great Cd Player....Almost,"I loved this cd player. The Sony Psyc Walkman played great quality music and was at a price i could afford. I did buy new headphones for it because i didnt like the h.ear headphones that came with it. I've been using this product for a year, and one day it just died on me. JUST DIED! I'm sorry if I am being overly dramatic but I really trusted Sony on this, and I loved the quality of it and everything, but after one year the player stopped working. When I would close the lid it would barely make a couple of lines out on the LCD which is supposed to say DISC. But when I press play nothing works. If someone had a problem like this and fixed it, please tell me how because I really want to have my cd player back!!!"
3,worked about six months,Although I did liked this CD played When it worked. One day in December of last year it didn't worked any more. The play button will not would not work anymore.
1,A disappointment,I bought this CD player for my son Christmas 2004. It lasted about one year before it just would cut out in the middle of playing a CD even though the batteries were new. Subsequently the controls stopped working. I have bought two Sony boomboxes in the past 5 years and both had issues where the CD player stopped working without it getting that much use. Sony used to be known for its product reliability but after my last few experiences I will not buy Sony products again.
3,Great for a while....,"When I first got this machine, I was pretty happy with it. All of the functions worked great, the sound was amazing, and it can also show how much time is left for the track, which I thought was a pretty neat addition. Unfortunately, just after three months of listening, just out of warranty, the CD player stopped working. The lens stopped reading the disks, and it would cost over $30 to have it fixed! I tried cleaning it myself, but that didn't work. So I decided to get another one. Also, the black paint gets scratches and fingerprints all over it easily and the headphones aren't that great because the speaker part sticks out of the ear. Overall, I rate this three stars because it was great while it lasted but I expected it to last much longer."
3,Does the Job-for a while,"This CD player was great at first. My kids used it all the time, especially on car/bus rides to school. However, after a few months of sitting in a carefully selected backpack pouch, buttons stopped working. They were not very sturdy and the batteries started to run low faster. Good as a temporary fix, but not a sturdy system."
5,Sweet!,This cd player works well and looks cool too! I think that it is way cooler than my last cd player!
3,worked for less than a year!!,"I bought this CD player as a birthday gift to my brother last June. It had been working fine till about a month ago, when it started to DIE at times!!! It dies off, then comes to life after a few days/weeks. It is currently dead.[...]The headphones were of a poor quality also, they lasted for about 10 months.SOund quality, when there is sound, is great.But, in less than a year, I have to buy my brother another CD player. Didn't expect this from SONY AT ALL!!!"
1,Defective CD Player,"I purchased this cd player for my teenage son for Christmas. He barely got to use it and one day it just stopped working. Apparently, there was oxidation inside the cd player and since it had been more than 30 days since it was purchased, I was unable to return it. Good luck."
5,Sony D-EJ100PS Psyc Walkman Portable CD Player (Black),This is just to replace the one I had before when it fell to the ground and became inoperable afterward.
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!!,"The CD player was purchased for a gift - it was just given and it does not work!!!! Although it spins the CD, the CD will not play - the player skips around over and over - it will not work with any CD - the CDs we tried work fine on other players. This is a total disappointment and very embarrassing. How do I get my money back?"
3,Small project carousel,"Great little palette for small projects where you just use a squirt of paint. I have yet to find anyone who sells the replacement sponges online or in stores. This is made to be placed in the One Stroke Palette however, the only benifet of that is to anchor your thumb in the palette and carry it to your work. The Palette has little depressions for paint around the outside but there is no way to preserve them for later.If you intend on working on canvas or large projects this is deffinately too small for you."
2,"The other version is ultimately better, buuuut....","This version of Samantha Mumba seems like an indefinitely out-of-date, unpolished, unhip counterpart of its worked-over more recent version which has far more attractive, colorful cover art and the polished radio pop remixes of ""Baby Come Over"" and ""The Boy."" Which version you will prefer, however, relies heavily on your taste. This disc leans far more towards R&B and hip-hop, while the reworked version with the yellow and red cover is pretty much pure pop. I prefer the other version because it's just more fun and twice as infectious, but like I said, it depends on your taste. The original version of ""Baby Come Over"" is actually cool in its own way-I could picture it on black radio, while the fizzy pop remix fits white pop radio best."
2,Songs Are Different - BEWARE,"If you love the radio versions of ""Gotta Tell You"" and ""Baby, Come Over,"" DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. You have to buy the American version with the red and yellow cover (she is wearing a red and yellow outfit with black boots). The songs are totally different on the American version and SO MUCH BETTER!!! Take my word for it. I wish I would have known ahead of time. I hate the European version."
2,Two Hit Songs Nothing Like the Rest,"Samantha Mumba has an incredible voice. There is a magic that just grabs you. It is so magic, that I bought the whole album expecting much of the same. (I almost never buy the whole album for anyone any more because of past burns) Well, it's happened again. ""Gotta Tell You"" and ""Baby, Come Over"" rock! They are great songs. The rest of the album has nothing remotely similar to either of those wonderful songs. If you want to buy it, buy it for those two songs - cause the rest of the album will disappoint."
5,greatest album ever,"This is a great album I do not care what anyone else says even less what a bunch of pompous yanks have to say about her like Americans know anything about good music anyways you ever listen to the garbage that comes out of that country anyways enough about dumb Americans, This is agreat album if you do not believe that Samantha can sing just listen to the samples of her tracks and believe you will notice that she can sing."
2,"Hey, I gotta tell you ....","I guess when your biggest single is almost nothing like the rest of your album, the result is a one-hit wonder. Which is pretty much what Samantha Mumba was/is (atleast in the USA). You see, I loved ""Gotta Tell You"" (the single). Many, many people loved it. It was pretty popular back in its day ... around November/December of 2000, I think? I'm not sure. But anyway, I loved that song and asked for the CD for Christmas, which I got in the end. (The version I received was not an import, I don't think, and it was out at Christmas. It had all the same tracks as this, so it really doesn't matter.) I listened to it through a couple times and never picked it up again. I liked three songs on this CD, ""Gotta Tell You"", ""Come On Over"", and ""Always Come Back To Your Love"". The point is, I recommend that if you love the single ""Gotta Tell You"" you should buy the single or download it. The whole album isn't worth it."
3,everyone is a critic,"Samantha Mumba would be just another pop singer if it wasn't for a unique twist in her music. Her lyrics are mainly about boys and her various love interests. In these regards, she is no different from any other Britney Spears pop culture singer. However, she manages to keep a certain spicy, upbeat rhythm to her music that keeps her apart from the main pop singers. Mumba's CD consists of two types of music - the ""slow dance"" and the faster paced, dance team style. While her first song ""Gotta Tell You"" was a great dance track, the second was a little monotonous and slower paced than the first. The entire CD switches off from one style to the other, but still entertains more than it annoys. I would give it three stars out of five."
1,Yuck,"I'm soory, but I can't stand this chick - she doesn't seem very talented to me and she just seems like another pop singer gal who just wants to be famous. Most of the songs are pretty dry and not too fun so to all of you out there who are debating whether or not to get the album, my advice would be to think about it before you do. No offense to all you Samantha Mumba fans out there, but this CD is definetly not one of my favorites."
4,Better for a softer look,"I've been using Epson papers since I switched from the wet darkroom to digital. I have an Epson 1400 that prints 13x19. The paper gives a very professional look. My only complaint is that it uses a lot of ink and the photos don't have the pop that I'm looking for. To get the pop, I have to use high gloss - I've found that for digital, you get better, sharper prints with the high gloss than the matte. The matte paper gives you a softer look, and is wonderful when printing images of children."
4,Great Presentation Paper!,"In my art school, we have to use this paper to present our digital work after we print it on Epson printers with matte ink. (DON'T USE LASER PRINTING ON THIS PAPER and make sure you print on the right side. There is a yellowish tint on one side to help you) I bought it on Amazon because I didn't want to spend 2 bucks a sheet anymore at the local store!!!Matte paper prints very nicely except sometimes marks show up if the image is rubbed up against.Highly recommend for professional presentation and such."
5,Memphis is doin' something big,"This is one of the best cds of 2003. I'm from the Northwest, but in my opinion, Memphis has put out some of the best rap music in the past couple of years. Yo Gotti has an original style and this cd stands out from the rest of the crowd. Rap Hustlaz and HCP are blowin up. I like every track on this cd... except for ""shake it"" and ""look at old girl""... and they aren't bad songs.. they're just the ones that I usually skip. Buy this cd, especially if you like Three 6, Skinny Pimp, etc."
3,Interesting Not Outstanding,I 1970's horror story about being stuck in a nursing home. Will make the reader more aware of problems attached with aging and how to plan ahead
1,"This cd tried to offer us a lot, but in the end offered noth","This cd tried to offer us a lot of songs via medleys, but really missed it's make in the end.I really like Michaels' voice. It is a one of a kind voice. This cd could had been great had Michael just concentrated on singing about 10 or 12 really good songs. I think the arranging was ok for this cd and Michaels' delivery seemed to sound good.This was one of his first cds and I agree he was just learing. I think in future cds Michael will be much better. It's just a shame we had to be his ginny pigs."
3,Interesting collection of rare tracks but..,"..one quick peek at the booklet reveals the following statement, ""Tracks have been mastered from disc due to the loss of the original master tapes"", and then you realise all those loud clicks and pops you're hearing are NOT intentional.. what a shame, cos there are some real gems here by the likes of Big In Japan, Lori & the Chameleons, Expelaires and the Wild Swans. the inferior sound quality also means that this music will never rise above relative obscurity."
3,Snapshot of early 80's Manchester,"The influence of the Zoo Label on the post-punk, indie rock of the early 19080's is irrefutable. As evidenced by the names included on this sampler, if not the bands themselves. Tear drop Explodes/Julian Cope, Echo & the Bunnymen/Ian McCulloch, and Ian Broudie (later of the Lightening Seeds) all have their earliest recordings included here. While this is great for hearing the evolution of the bands, the recordings are not always the best quality and some of the song writing is crude at best (especially Big in Japan). Hover, there are some great songs here and to hear Lori & the Chameleons is worth the purchase price."
2,disappointed,"This book doesn't cover a lot of practical stuff. As an integrated optics book, the fabrication part and the measurement part are totally missed- what a pity! Buy Hunsperger's ""Integrated optics"" and it is much much cheaper."
5,Great for Banana Pudding!,This is the BEST whisk for making smooth homemade banana pudding. I have gotten this whisk for every baker in my family. I'm sure it would be good to use on any type of sauce since it's great on thickening pudding til the end. Highly recommend this whisk!
5,Best whisk,This whisk gets into every last corner of a pot or bowl. Quickly whisks and emulisifies. Takes up very little space in a drawer. It has become my go to utensil for bechamel sauce and salad dressing.
5,Great Whisk! Top Notch Quality,"This is certainly a high quality, solid piece! I greatly appreciate the design. The hinge gives you added dexterity with sauces.For whipping eggs, the Kuhn Rikon 10"" double balloon whisk is unmatched! The two whisks get lots of use and I wouldn't be without either of them!"
2,It's okay.,"Kuhn Rikon Heart Spring 10-Inch WhiskI grew up with a whisk similar in style or design to this one, so I was excited to find this one here on Amazon.When I initially bought this product, it did not mention the hinged handle (or neck). I was unable to use it the way I was familiar with and it was almost impossible for me to whip simple eggs due to the hinge. The head of the whisk can flip back and forth to lay flat agains the handle and does this while in use. There is no way to stabalize the head for whipping. Also the handle is pretty slim, making it hard to grip and the head is pretty small probably making it more work to cover a big pot. Maybe a thicker handle might be more comfortable and a bigger head for less work. It may do well for stirring sauces (sliding head flat along bottom of pot) and preventing lumps as my old one did but I returned it before trying it out."
2,Dissapointing,"I was hoping to find a whisk small enough to whisk things I usually did with a fork. Not only is it too big to whisk 1 or 2 eggs in a small bowl, but the coil section tends to flip over every time you whisk in a certain angle and things get trapped in the coil. I find it more of a hassle than convenience!"
1,Sorry to contradict the other reviews. . .,"I just got the charger and wanted to try it out right away. I plugged it in with the battery attached as the directions stated. . .there was an immediate spark and black soot on the outlet and wall. It had blown the fuse. Needless to say I don't think I will be using it, and I hope Amazon backs the product."
3,low budget wonder,"Done on an obvious low (maybe no) budget. It's a little long, but to see a bunch of unknown probably amatuer actors make a sincere attempt at sci fi comedy --- It's worth a look."
4,Smaller than I was expecting,"I love the looks of the watch, but it wasn't presented well on the website. It was much smaller than I was expecting. I have several Invictas and it's the first one that I have been disappointed in both the size of the dial and band."
2,Liked watch but !,"Liked the look of watch, but I could not adjust the time because of the Stem being stuck in place. Otherwise the look of the watch was pleasing to the eye."
1,Cheap watch,"The watch arrived very late, and when it did, it was very much different than the description. It looks as if it were an expensive watch but ended up feeling very cheap, especially the buckle. Soon after it arrived, the second hand kept getting stuck on the minute hand causing the time to be wrong frequently. In addition, it is supposed to be a divers watch and water resistant however water can easily get in through the crown. Overall, not what I expected and not the best product."
2,This is not the Real Immaculate Fools.,"I don't like the copies. If it's not real forget it. By the way, I'm trying to find the album in which ""Got me by the heart"" it's included. If someone knows where I can find it, please write me to yolemex@hotmail.com. Thanks. Leo Cepeda"
1,Who are these guys?,This is NOT the real Immaculate Fools! - these guys just do not compare to the REAL THING!!!
1,"""Politically correct"" drivel","I remember when this album was on the radio non-stop, and it was ""hip"" to be against nuclear power. Well, these political ""experts"" of showbiz got what they wanted. Nuclear power plants have been shut down, and no new ones have been built. And now we are abjectly dependent on foreign oil and ""carbon footprint""-ing coal. Nice job, political geniuses! And now Obama, the king of the liberals, wants to fund two new reactors. Too little too late! We should have been ""GO NUKES"" for the past thirty years."
4,Love No Nukes,Great double CD just wish it were a triple! These concerts were held for several consecutive days at Madison Square Garden when I was in college. I had a chance to go but didn't - and it's one of my only true regrets in life!
5,No Nukes,"I actually attended this concert. Mainly to see Bruce. Bought it in record form, them tape, them cd and now a new one to replace my old damaged one. There are so many great songs on this album. A true classic."
2,I really wanted to rate it higher,"I really liked this when it came ut on vinyl, but in retrospect, it was the cause, not the music. B. Raitt is grand, G Nash with an excellant Cathedral, J C Young, and the highlight to me We Almost Lost Detroit by the great Gil Scott-Heron. But the second disc is second rate. Edit the filler and it rates higher."
3,triviajohn,"Pretty boring stuff, except for the Springsteen track, which saves the day. Most of the artist featured on this album have concert albums that are far superior to the material found on this album.If you believe in the cause, are looking at this album as a historical document, or dig Springsteen's version of the Ryder medley, buy this album. If not, save your money."
1,no nukes,"It would have been helpful to be able to hear a short version of the songs on this album. I wouldn't have purchased it but I did. I returned it but as of this date September 14, 2012 I have yet received my refund. I'm a little upset about this. I didn't care for the live performances of the songs."
2,"Stiff, non-flexible, does not it as advertised (manufacturer)","The manufacturer states ""Get a Manufacturer-like Custom Fit"", and according to their catalog, item #1105200 fits the front, where as item #1105100 fits the rear to all Ford Vans Full-Size 98-01.Unfortunately, this is not the case. The items was supposed to be mounted on a 1999 Ford Econoline Full-Size Van. The contoured shaped, which is nice to protect the body around the splash guard where it is mounted, does not adjust. The entire splash guard is made out of a stiff material and does not adjust to the shape of the vehicle body around.If mounted, there would be either a rather large gap at the top between the flap and the vehicle body (which would allow debris and water to run into and sit there), or the flaps would be in an angle which would look awful.The Powerflow 6416 Pro-Fit Splash Guards, ordered at the same time, were a perfect fit, you might want to check out the description and review there.[...]"
2,"Good on the towns, not much in between","This is basically a list of towns in the order thatyou hit them driving Hw101. Its OK if thats allyou want but don't expect much guidance on thingsoff the beaten track, or indeed anywhere outsidea town!I found the Rough Guide Pacific Northwest bookmuch more useful."
2,needs a little color,"I'm sure some of the information in this book may be outdated by now (published in 2000) as things do change, but I bought this book thinking it would be second best to actually taking the drive, which is a little beyond my means to actually do. So I wasn't expecting 100% accuracy as much as I was hoping for more scenic photos. In fact, the few that are included are quite small, and black-and-white! This could have been a much better book with color photos."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"My mom asked for a toaster that could fit bagels. I as a college student wanted to get her something good quality, but that also fit my budget. My mom loves the toaster."
4,Great Christmas CD,"I really enjoy this CD. Not every track is wonderful, but in my opinion there are many good ones...Lisa Marie's Silent Night, Coldplay, Norah Jones, Josh Grobin's O Holy Night. Overall, a good pick."
5,CD,Love the new Christmas CD. I wasn't sure how this would be but it has a variety of musicians singing which was nice since I get sick of hearing one whole cd of the same person.
3,Eh...,"An okay cd. Some of the song are worth a look. Particularly Norah Jones, Coldplay and Sarah Brightman. I enjoyed Liz Phair's Winter Wonderland, but most of the songs aren't worth the time it takes to listen."
4,"SPEAKS FROM THE ""SOUL""","A CD for lovers, lovers of music, lovers of ""words"". Tim Camp writes what all of us have felt at some juncture in our lives.Great for slow dancing with your soulmate, too! Just hold each other ""close"" -- and don't let go!Slim Man delivers!"
4,Great TV for the price!,"If you are looking for a 30-plus inch LCD with a DVD player that upconverts standard 480i DVDs to near HD clarity, this TV offers the most bang for the buck. The picture is stunningly clear and the processor speed is impressive. Also, the internal antenna does a great job of picking up local HD networks. Speaker volume is perfect for the bedroom environment. The sleek black exterior is very fasion foward and the remote is easy to use.The only drawback is that after turning off the TV, the internal menu options that were selected earlier do not remain. It is like the TV has no memory for your preferences. So every time I turn it on, I have to select ""wide-screen"" AGAIN if I decide to watch an HD channel. Other than that, the set is perfect."
3,Excellent TV but 1/2 inch shorter screen size,"I love this TV.It provides an excellent picture from both TV and the incorporated DVD player. Very Convenient since you avoid the usual wiring clutter/additional remote control from external DVD player.I don't have it connected to a cable box and the internal tuner is able to pick HD signal from the ""air"" (cable wire).The screen size is 31 1/2 inches (1/2"" inch shorter than specs), unlike my two other TVs (20"" & 30"") which are right at specs. Toshiba acknowledged my email and said it is within their +/_ specs.Shipment was hard to track as amazon did not have info except indicating that seller (ButterflyPhoto) ships by DHL. I had to call ButterflyPhoto directly after several days coming back to the website and not finding any information. Customer Service was very helpful and I was given a UPS tracking number. It arrived one week later than the date given by amazon at time of purchase."
4,great for video games,"This is a great TV for playing video games because the image is sharp and crisp. SO far I have not connected the tv to a hi-def signal so I haven't been able to see how that is, but connecting to a regular non hi-def satellite receiver, the image is not as great as a regular crt tv. The sound is pretty good and being the size that it is, 32"" you do need to be at least 7 feet away to get a nice picture. Anything closer and you will notice the grains/pixels, but since I don't have a hi def receiver i can't tell how sharp it is when receiving tv signals.Overall I am happy with the TV."
1,A DVD disaster,"When Our new Toshiba television arrived I was impressed with the shipping company amazon used and with the fact the shipper opened the product and checked it out to see if everything was working, but he did not check the DVD player. It was not working. That's when the trouble began. Amazon did not have any more instock. They suggested going to a toshiba dealer to get the television repaired. The part would take months to get. The repair company said this is common with Toshiba. I sent it back to Amazon and whet with another Television.I loved the picture quality on the Regza, but I was left very disappointed and without a television for weeks."
3,DVD whirring is annoying otherwise okay,"Picture and sound are good but the inbuilt DVD makes a subtle whirring sound. If you can block it out and not pay attention it is okay, therwise it can be annoying. I don't know if other people had similar problem"
4,great for the price,"the tv work just fin in every sense, but the dvd fail to read most dads especially copies but still great product"
3,"Good TV, bad DVD player","I'm fully satisfied with the TV (picture quality, menu features, etc), but the built in DVD player has broken twice within the year. Luckily the 1-yr manufacturer's warranty is pretty good and they come to your home to fix it - but it's a major hassle. The repair guy said that this happens relatively often to the Toshiba TVs and they plan to stop producing the sets with built-in players. You're better off buying a TV-only set and get a nice swanky high-def DVD player to plug in!"
4,Good quality TV.,"I have had this TV/DVD combo for a little over a month, and so far it is doing all that I expected. At 32"" screen size the lack of 1080 resolution is not an issue. That size is quite adequate for a medium sized room, by the way. As others have mentioned, the remote doesn't offer many options for DVD control but that is balanced in my mind by the convenience of the built-in player at a reasonable price. I have not noticed the difficulty with noise from the DVD player mentioned by some other reviewers. The TV has multiple HDMI inputs and works fine with my HD cable hookup, also."
5,Great LCD TV!,"This is my second Toshiba LCD TV, and I bought this one based on my great results from the first one. I haven't been disappointed one bit! The picture clarity, the DVD player, the set's design, the sound . . . everything's been outstanding."
1,White Smoke / Very disappointing,"When I connected the TV to the electric outlet it began to throw large amounts of white smoke with a toxic smell. This is very disappointing as this TV set apparently was high rated.I buy a lot from amazon and never experienced any problems before.Now I'm waiting for amazon response in order to return this item and have a refund.The TV set looks very nice aesthetically, however, this in not very relevant if it doesn't work.Next time I would stick with the traditional brands.Leave TOSHIBA for the laptops."
4,A guy from Kansas loves this music.,"Ever since I caught Trust late at night on Bravo, I fell in love with Adrienne Shelly (who wouldn't?) and I was also introduced to Hal Hartley. The music accompanying the last shot was so (for the lack of a better word) cool, that I watched the credits to catch who did the music. After years of looking for this Ned Rifle guy, Hal released Amateur, and I got that soundtrack, and it was awesome. Now I just got this soundtrack, and it's twice as good. With the themes for Simple Men, the Unbelievable Truth, as well as Trust, this is a must have for any Hal Hartley (or Adrienne Shelly) fan."
3,Just to let you know...,"Anyone who is buying this for the Hub Moore songs (specifically ""Walk Away""), should know that they are not all the same versions that were used in the films.Just thought I would put that out there, as this collection tends to fetch quite the pretty penny.*A"
