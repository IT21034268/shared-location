5,Awesome Play Money Set,"We have had a few cheap play money sets, and they were all cheap! This one is a very nice set and the tray is awesome. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't come with a plastic slide-in cover to keep the money in the tray for storage. It's just open. This would make it SUPER awesome, but still worth the money."
4,Great for Both Math Concepts and Dramatic Play,"I bought this set to introduce my preschool-age kids to money and to various mathematical concepts like skip-counting, place value, arithmetic, etc.. I wish there were at least 100 pennies (rather than 50) so I could have them place them on a hundreds board and exchange them for a dollar. The large number of half-dollar coins are not that practical if you're trying to teach about coins that people actually carry around the use, but are good for teaching math concepts, as well. Where this set really shines is for dramatic play activities. My kids enjoyed setting up a store and using their money to purchase 'groceries'. They also enjoy placing the coins into containers and carrying them around (although made from plastic, they make a neat jingling sound that slightly resembles real coins.To compensate for the lack of a lid, I use plastic wrap around the entire box, which can be re-used each time we take this toy out."
3,"Great Item, but NO lid",Bought this for my 2nd grade classroom. The kids loved figuring out the change due. The wooden storage box is excellent.The bills and coins are good reproductions. Hate that it comes with no lid. They need to change this in the description.
4,Really nice but needs a lid!!,I really like this toy. My daughter is in 3rd grade and her class gets very excited about counting play money. It is very educational BUT the box should really come with a lid because hundreds of little pieces are never going to stay put with it open. I need to figure something out or the money will be lost.
2,Use at your own risk.,"I made the mistake of using this on a night hike. Long story short, my Gps fell out of it somewhere along my hike and I wasn't able to find it once I noticed it was gone. Product is okay as long as you pay attention and take it easy, but who wants to do that?"
5,Inner Voice Guidebook,"I have found that following up on hunches, feelings or listening to my inner voice produces much better answers to questions than if I simply rely on logic. This book teaches how to access that inner knowledge found inside each of us and encouranges the reader to follow that inner guidance in order to live a more peaceful, satisfying life. There are exercises that teach you how to do it and true stories contributed by people illustrating how accessing their inner voice helped them make the best decisions. Highly recommended."
5,Great Quality,"This is a very good quality. The color is rich. I prefer this strap to the clip that most other holders have. The Pearl goes into sleep mode when you insert it, but the settings on the phone can be changed so calls are not lost if you place the phone in the holder while you are talking. This case protects your investment well. I can also fit a credit card/photo id behind my phone if I don't want to take my entire purse in somewhere."
3,"Beautiful dial, but questionable strap","When I first opened the watch and saw it I was amazed at how nice this was. It's very true to the picture. Then I put it on and it just felt a little...off. I didn't know what it was but the fit was so off, particularly for a watch with a leather band. Then I realized the watch band came backwards! I could have probably taken it to a watch repair and had it fixed but I mean I bought this brand new and shouldn't have to pay out my pocket to get it back to how it should have been to begin with.What was worse is I had to actually pay the shipping to return it even though it was defective. I didn't trust the re-seller (KG) with another so I ate the loss of shipping fees (both receiving and returning).All in all, it's a very nice watch with an easy to read dial, but I won't buy from this seller (KG) again."
2,Poor reference material,"This book is not really a dictionary, but more of a micro-encyclopedia. It does have an impressive list of items and the superstitions associated with those items. The problem is that the details given are very poorly researched and there are no sources sited. Each of the articles under each item are not well constructed or organized, particularly for the larger entries. There appears to be a lot of hearsay in the book. Without sources sited, the reader may become suspicious as to whether the author is pulling their leg, or was having his leg pulled by someone else. There has got to be better sources for this information."
5,GREAT Book,I have a LOT of access experience and wanted to move to SQL Server.This is a great beginner book for those with a little knowledge of SQL and a lot of knowledge of relational databases.Great chapters on SQL usage.GET THIS BOOK!!
1,"WORDY, BADLY WRITTEN","Many of the subjects treated were glossed over and/or not fully explained. The authors managed to eek out over 700 pages of textwith such stunning revelations the following paraphrase. ""Computer information processes have made an decisive long-lasting effect on business all over the world."" I don't know about you but I do not like shelling out many bucks to read that kind of tripe when what I wanted was specific information on SQL. The minute section on JOINS was particularly disappointing as it was unclear and badly written."
1,Not as good as Microsoft's on-line help.,"This is a very poorly written book. It wastes thousands of words telling the reader what it is going to tell you...and then...after all the build up...it doesn't tell you as much as the built-in SQL help files. The writing is often obtuse, and sometimes cryptic. Microsoft's on-line help gives more information, more concisely. This book does not live up to SAMS books reputation."
1,For beginners -only-.,"This is the most useless book I've ever purchased. It rambles on from ""what is a databse?"" to ""cost threshold for parallelism"" without ever covering something as simple as inserting the date and time (or null not as a string) into a table. Certainly the last ""Sams"" book I'll ever buy."
2,Where's the Product Key?,"The main purpose of buying this book was the Eval SQL-2000 CD so I could upgrade from my Beta 2 installation.To my surprise, the Eval CD required a Product Key, but there wasn't one in sight."
5,fun and edicational,"I think it teaches kids that having a horse isn`t just about riding and petting the horse. sooner or later you will have to feed , water and pick up after the horse. you can`t always have your parent`s doing the dirty work. it also is a nice addition to the barn because it gives it an authentic look."
4,"the ""complete"" set","Since we have a horse, DD wanted a set like this. This was the only one that actually had something to clean up!"
4,Ravioli Made Easy,"This ravioli maker and press makes it relatively easy to produce uniform ravioli quickly. I had never made ravioli before, and had success."
2,get what you pay for,"I realize it wasn't that expensive, but I had serious issues with this. The directions say to press the two pieces together and recommend a rolling pin. However, neither piece make it easy to roll. The plastic part is what holds the filling, so it is bumpy. The metal part had feet on the bottom so you can't use a rolling pin there either. Also after you press them together, you still have to use something to cut them apart. Depending on how wet or dry your pasta is, or the filling makes it... it could stick to either of the pieces. I had tried using some non stick spray but that only made the pasta more moist and sticky. Be ready to have a few bad batches."
2,Kinda useless.....,"Although this is easy if you want all the raviolis to be the exact same size and all, but the zip zags DO NOT cut the dough. So you end up cutting itself, and its overall just kinda awkward. Id rather just roll the douch out, and cut ito my own raviloi's"
2,Not a time saver,"It does not really save time, so you might as well do everything by hand. The dough sticks to the sides and it is rather hard to get the ravioli out if you miss a tiny spot and not put a lot of flour on every crease of the metal part. Besides, you need to press real hard and roll several times to make the dough cut the into squares. When I wanted to reuse the remaining part of the dough, it became so hard that it was impossible to stretch it over the maker."
4,making raviolis,seems to work fine able to make raviolis just fine and kind of fun also my 14 year old was making them with ease
5,"It works great, perfect little ravs!","I needed something to make ravioli, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This little device works great. I couldn't be happier. Thanks"
3,not so great,"this is not so easy to use. the instructions are not very clear and there is a lot of trial and error to get the desired results. it does not tell you how much water to use to wet the pasta to get the sheets to stick together and i was surprised at how much i had to use.also, it was not very easy to remove the filled ravioli from frame."
3,Ravioli Maker,"It is quite easy to use, but after raviolis are boiled they come out huge and falling apart because of that. This maker would've been a lot better if it was smaller."
5,I am having so much fun with this product,"I did a little twist with this product. I have been using it to make seafood puffs. The possibilities are endless, I have been using puff pastry instead of pasta. what a hoot!"
2,Great easy to use,Havent used yet but plan on soon it looks easy to use and I will soon but just havent yet
2,NOT dishwasher safer,"Hi, i used this once, it worked great, but then I put it in the dishwasher. DO NOT do that, the coating disappears immediately, and you wind up having the bare metal underneath, which is probably toxic (it stains your fingers really badly)I am throwing mine away, and looking for a different one. This product should have a prominent NOT SAFE FOR DISHWASHER warning on the packaging box."
4,Item has not arrived yet,I look forward to this item. The ravioli press is not here yet. I have used it at a friend's house and it will be perfect for making ravioli for my family.
2,"Cosi, Cosi","I have made ravioli for years. I tried this devise just last weekend and found it be be so, so. The problem is, it does not cut an separate the individual ravioli from the group. The form is made of aluminum and it just does not cut well. One can make the ravioli much faster by hand."
2,Dishwasher blackened it,Whatever kind of metal this is made of is not dishwasher safe. It turned black after being in the dishwasher. The bad part is the black comes off on the pasta when you make raviolis. I ate them anyway because I didn't want to waste them. It still works well but it makes the pasta black. If you putSquid Ink - 0.14 oz. x 20 pcsin the pasta when you are making it you won't notice the black from the metal.
5,Norpro Ravioli Maker and Press,The Norpro Ravioli Maker and Press is amazing. I learned how to make ravioli from my mother the old-fashioned way and this cuts the time way down.
4,Easy to use; great for small batches,"This is a great tool for cutting perfectly sized and shaped ravioli. Easy to use with a rolling pin. I spray the metal component down with oil prior to laying the sheets and rarely have trouble popping the ravioli out. I only make my dough from scratch, so often have a little trouble getting the sheets to match the size of the maker perfectly. Sometimes there's waste, which is a bit annoying.Overall, it works really well. I think my needs are more suited for a wheel, but if you're likely to buy precut pasta sheets, this is an awesome tool!"
5,Works fine lasts a long time,Easy to use and clean. makes nice size raviolli. Get a cheap wooden roller to help with the final sealing and cutting.
5,A No-Brainer way to Ravioli,"This is probably the easiest way to literally make as many ravioli as possible, only limited to as much pasta dough and filling you have, at an assembly-line pace.The very first time I used it I made 12 dozen ravioli in less that 30 minutes.The only caveat is to either sufficiently flour or spray oil onto the metal component.I highly recommend this to any and all."
3,They look beautiful,"I usually make ravioli by hand. I thought this sounded easy enough and my raviolis would look much prettier (more uniform in shape). I read all the reviews beforehand, made sure I sprayed with cooking spray and didn't have any issues getting them out. They were BEAUTIFUL. That being said, they had too much air in them. When I make them by hand I can press the air out for the most part. I don't think you can get the air out without taking away how they look, the whole reason I bought this in the first place."
3,Good,"Just work great, be carefull with the thicknees of the dough. Good for a home dinner. Overall is a good product"
3,Disappointed :(,"I had high hopes for this thing after I read other customers' reviews. The white plastic part that's supposed to push pockets into the dough for the filling to be place doesn't leave an indent for very long (your have to work very fast). The metal part needs to have wider sides so that the whole thing doesn't move when your trying to roll the dough through its shapes. The dough sticks to it unless you put a good coat of flour on it before anything. The legs of the metal stand need to have some sort of non-slip material added to their bottoms because it is impossible to keep the stupid thing still when putting a roller on it.Overall, good concept... poor execution."
5,Works Great,"I bought this ravioli maker to go along with a pasta machine I recently received. I made a couple of small ""practice"" batches of raviolis before I got the hang of it. The first time I didn't use any oil or flour on the metal base and all of the raviolis stuck to it. The second batch I used some spray cooking oil and that helped a lot. If you use ricotta cheese as a filling be sure to try and let the ricotta drain for a bit otherwise the raviolis will have a lot of liquid inside. Also letting the raviolis sit for a few minutes after cooking seems to give them time firm up a bit. Great little kitchen accessory."
4,Works well,"Does as promised, 12 ravioli made quickly. I followed the hints from other folks on amazon reviews and used some cooking spray before each use, helps it pop out easier. I also wetted down all the seams on the bottom sheet of pasta and never had any problem with it coming apart. Great product for the price. I have made probably 20 dozen batches and all turned out great!"
2,Not necessary,Ravioli's made by this tray are too small. Really not worth buying. I would rather make them by hand than use this item.
2,May Work ...,This may work if you get your pasta dough just the right consistency and thickness and flour everything well. My ravioli wouldn't come out of the press despite a fair bit of experimenting. Went back to the manual procedure in frustration.
3,room for improvement,"The ravioli press makes a nice size ravioli. The drawbacks are the plastic base with the holes shaped for filling tears the pasta sheet easily. I haven't mastered getting the pasta in that depression, and completely filled without tearing. Also, I recommend using a rolling pin to crimp the sheets between the molds. This is somewhat difficult since the plastic slips around on the counter, and there are little feet that stick up on the metal side in 6 areas which prevent rolling with longer passes. You must do one half of the mold at a time, and both ends have feet as well, making this part not accessible with the rolling pin. Without rolling, you risk not crimping the ravioli sealed. Pros, the ravioli do not stick to either part of the mold. The metal crimper is heavy duty material. Works OK for now, but I'd like to get a ravioli cutter/wheel type. You need to spend extra time with the sheets fitting in the little filling depressions. Plan on losing a few due to tears."
3,"It works, but so do you!!","This device does make decent ravioli, but there's lots of work involved, by making your own pasta dough, and rolling everything out by hand--Quite exhausting when you have a large family. I would recommend doing so many servings per day, freeze until ready to eat. It makes a good size ravioli (about 2 inch sq). You have to experiment with the right amount of filling so it doesn't get trapped in the seams and break open during the cooking process, but I guess it's the next best thing if you're not willing to pay the $60.00 and up for the advanced pasta/ravioli makers."
3,Takes some practice,"The product works fine, but you do have to practice a bit getting the dough to just the right consistency. If too dry or too thin, it will tear the noodle when you push the mold down into the frame. Once you get the hang of it though, you will be pleased with the results. Be careful not to overload the indentations with filling. To insure a good seal, I like to use a light egg wash on the inside of the top noodle. Lastly, be sure to spray a light coating of Pam on the metal mold so they'll release easily.In all, it's kind of a slow process with this device, but the finished Ravi's do look great and stay together while cooking. I'm still torn between doing it this way and simply creating half moon ravioli's by hand -- which is much faster and can be done using a thinner noodle. If you're looking for quantity production, do it by hand...if you want perfectly shaped pasta however, then by all means buy this inexpensive little device."
1,Not what I expected,"Very unhappy with product. Raviolis stuck to press, very difficult to remove. Maybe beginner luck, will try again."
4,Makes a small Ravioli,"I have nothing bad to say about this product. It does it's job well. However, if I had it to do over again, I'd buy a ravioli maker that cut a larger ravioli. Other than that, this product works fine."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"This ravioli maker was what I needed to replace one that was lost. Soon after receiving it, I made raviolis and the maker was just what I needed. Raviolis were so much easier to do, as well as attractive. I have the maker handy so that before long I'll try another recipe."
1,Bad,This movie is bad.there is a few parts that people will like when the eye shoots the girls with his ray and the girls walk around topples. But this movie has now story how was a eye ball going to get the girl pregnant anyways.that it it is a horny eye ball.stupied I now. I hade to sit threw it. Waste of money.
3,killer eye halloween haunt,"a little better then frist one.but not much better.what going on charles band you use to put out good b movies do you remanbe r puppetmaster ,subspecies,trancers,castle freak,the pit and the pendulum,from the 90s those were good movies .but these last movies you heve put out are not very good like skull heads ,the haunted casino, killer eye halloween haunt.you have drop the ball sir .but im still a fullmoon fan y you ask ,because maybe charles band will make some better movies down the line like he did in the 90s."
1,Not for Beginners,"This is not a book for beginners. While it does illustrate how to string, hold, and tune a guitar and explain the differences between various guitars it is a total waste if you do not know how to read music."
2,Not for Me.....Matt.,"I was saddened on my first listen. This is a poorly chosen andrecorded CD. That is my opinion. I actually love so much of Matt'sstuff, this was a great disappointment to me! Pass on it, all the way.Truth hurts or heals......it's your choice.......Breadmanwalking....."
5,Linksys is always a good value,I bought this to replace a 4 port switch. I needed more ports on my switch. I plugged this in and it saw the network right away. Absolutely not problems. Easy install. Has been on my home network for a month now. No problems. Great Switch. I highly recommend.
5,Perfect extension to an Airport Express,"I bought this to provide multiple wired connections in my living room for my home theatre setup. Worked perfectly - no software to install, just plugged the output from an Airport Express into the switch upload port and then connected the home theatre components and I was in business."
1,Buyer Beware,"All ports began running slow after just 6 months of use. Followed LinkSys RMA process and they sent me a hub in return by mistake. I followed yet another LinkSys RMA process and had to wait TWO MONTHS for the replacement switch covering their mistake. The replacement switch died after 1 week of use. The latest RMA unit ran excessively Hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up. This is what I have learned about Linksys: #1) This should be a simple network pass-through device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly - Linksys apparently cannot make a good one. #2) Do not even think about turning a broken unit into Linksys under their RMA process, they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it cannot be trusted. If these cheap switches fail they cannot be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place. #3) Choose a competitors product - I have had other brand switches running for years with no issues."
1,linksys router wrt54gx,"I now have had 3 linksys routers that work transiently and then quit. There is effectively no honest tech support, only a group of foreigners who do nothing but stall and give you the run around. The warrentee is useless. I spent 8 hours with tech and got no result. They refuse to authorize a return and warrantee replacement. The products all died within 6 months. Do not buy a linksys product under any circumstances. Flush the money down the toilet. It will be more satisfying. MD, PH.D."
3,don't mistake for a DSL/Cable Router,"Unit works properly as a switch but will not configure without a static IP from your ISP. As most ISP's only accord this for business accounts, this is not your box. Quite adequate as a 10/100 switch though limted documentation."
5,Linksys EZXS88W 8-port & uplink switch.,"This is a great 8-port switch, excelent performance, have uplink and 8-ports for users, commendable."
5,You can't go wrong with this,"This is a great little box for connecting a small network without breaking your bank.The EZXS88W has a great work/size ratio. It's small enough to set on top of a computer case and provides eight ports of full duplex, 10/100 networking.It has a very informative display to give out info for connection speed, duplex connection and collision. The setup is as simple as plugging in the power and network cables. I have yet to run into any problems with this unit and would recommend it without a second thought."
3,Handy...,"I've found it to be handy and at a good price, but like other reviewers I had some problems. Ports tend to go bad and sometimes the unit dies. I was able to get warranty replacements and the new ones havent had problems yet."
5,Very Pleased With This Workgroup Switch...,"Overall I'm very pleased with this workgroup switch. The speeds are just as good as being connected directly to the modem. The only thing worth noting is that the device I received is colored different. Instead of being blue and black the one I received was all black. As I said, this made no material difference, the device has worked properly for over 2 years now. Very satisfied."
5,Perfect. As easy as an extension cord.,A perfect switch for my home network. I've been using it for months. It is cascaded off my 4 port router when my network expanded. Works flawlessly. You just plug into your network and your up and running. My network consists of a Netgear router feeding this switch which in turn feeds a wireless access point. My only complaint is that I should have bought the 16 port unit as this one is full.Network novices should remember that an 8 port switch is really only a 7 port switch as the 8th port is shared with the WAN uplink. At least this switch has the separate uplink port.
2,What Quality Control?,"I bought this to replace a Linksys 5-Port Switch that died after several years of use. I'll be surprised if this one lasts a year. I definintely got a bad one, but it's so inexpensive, it's not really worth the expense and inconvenience of returning it to either Linksys or the marketplace seller. This should be a fool-proof device, and probably is if you get a good unit. Mine, on the other hand, thinks there is always something connected to port 4, bringing down the entire network. Actually connecting something to port 4 solved that problem, but I'm still experiencing intermittant periods of packet loss of about 25% that require multiple restarts of the switch to correct. If you're looking for an inexpensive switch, I might suggest buying several of these so you can be sure to get at least one good one, keep another good one as a backup, and return the remainder. Otherwise spend the extra money for a switch made by a company with actual quality control."
5,Works great,"Plug-and-play with my existing network, which is comprised of 2-wire router, Netgear switch and this Linksys switch. They all play well together. I'm happy with this purchase."
4,Lasted almost 9 years,"After nine years my 8-port Linksys Etherfast 10/100 EZXS88W finally started to get flaky. It would just stop working (but the lights would stay on) and I would have to unplug and then plug it in again to get it working.Perfectly reliable until recently. I do think this kind of device should literally last until is it obsolete, but 9 years is not too bad (cost me $75 new in 2002). I replaced it with a 8-port gigabit Trendnet which was no reflection on Linksys, just a better deal at the time.TRENDnet 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit GREENnet Standard Switch (8 x 10/100/1000Mbps Auto-Negotiation, Auto-MDIX Gigabit Ethernet Ports) TEG-S80G (Black Metal)"
3,duchess did it!,"the new boy is a story about moving to a new school and a boy's struggle for acceptance by his male peers.the first part of the book is very clear on jack's frustration and anger over picked on by some of the other boys(which jack resolves via fighting). slowly overtime,the other boys get to know jack and grow to like him. jack and his newfriends go on some ""adventures"" as young boys do and get into a bit of trouble but,in the end it all works out.this book was written in 1950 and does contain some dialog that is a bit dated today but,the story is still valid."
3,belly ring,"the details are great on this product. The post is a little short and the curve on the bar is a little close to place the end ball to close the ring on your belly button. If you have a lot of skin between the to holes, you might have a hard time putting the ring on. My belly button hole is wide or deep and not shallow and it was difficute to put the ring on, once it was on it was neat looking and not uncomfortable as i thought it would be. It would be nicer if it was easyer to put on. The over all product and details are great and it looks nice."
5,Herz An Herz,This is an excellent album. The selection of songs is outstanding and the singers voice and delivery compliment each song.
1,Not a good product,"This is bad product. I installed the toner in mid February of this year. It splatters ink over the printed pages. It makes a loud noise and printer stops. Company refuses to replace. It says that I have to return the toner in order that they may verify that it is defective. They will replace it if it is defective. In other words they do not believe the customer. I do not want to buy from them again. I am not sure if I will buy from Amazon again, unless they correct the situation."
2,"Poor product, poor support","We bought 2 laserjet toners to try them out. 1 failed out of the box and the other one worked. I contacted LocoProducts, and they promised to send a warranty replacement. It has not arrived. After 3 weeks, a reminder email was sent. They were confused as to where the product was shipped, but promised to send another. Another month has come and gone with no product arriving. They are polite, but their support system seems to be a little whack."
3,Not great for kids.,"I got this and a set of drums for my young nephews for Christmas. They seemed to like it. It taught them the basics of holding the drumstick and how to start playing, but they were too young for the tuning part. Although they did start playing right away, it was more out of fun than actually paying attention to the lessons.This might be better for someone older who can understand the theory."
3,a bit too pop.....,"well, i think i prefer Eric in a more fusion, jazz setting. Nevertheless, this is still a nice cd to listen to :)"
4,Nice bag!,"I bought this for my husband to use for work. It is a well made bag, but smaller than I had visualized. But, it carries his lunch!"
2,"Too small, too flimsey",Bought because of past good experience with Peak products.This is a weak vinyl bag which is too small for more than a child's lunch.I do not expect it to have a long life.
1,"Really Bad Movie. Lackluster dialog, cardboard acting, terrible ending.","There was nothing interesting or redeeming about this movie. Keanu had an awful, boring and one dimensional character. He goes to prison for a crime he did not commit, but it made no sense why. His wife leaves him for lesser man and then he falls in love with a woman who anyone in their right mind would not want to spend 5 minutes with. Then to add to the insult of the fact that you actually sat though the worst movie you have seen in recent memory, the ending is so abrupt it is like they ran out of film or money or maybe just forgot to add the ending scene. Rarely do I find a movie with nothing I liked about it at all, but this one definitely fits that bill."
4,:-),"It's Keanu, what's not to love? A nice little indie flick, really good actors, interesting story within a story, lovely!"
1,Don't waste your time or $$$,Typical Keeanu movie! Should've known! No wonder it didn't make it in to big screen but went straight to DVD!
1,KEANU FANS ONLY ...,"Keanu's only exciting movie was Speed. With all the action going on, the beautiful Sandra Bullock and the equally beautiful Keanu Reeves to stare at, Speed was a hit.Now, we have Keanu alone to gaze at in a movie with a boring/stupid plot, nothing to look at in the background and a confused Vera Farmiga. Trust me, folks, it ain't even worth the 99 cents."
1,Horrible,What a waste of movie space this was. Straight to the garbage can and from now on I'll look closer at reviews.
2,SLOW,"Starts out very slow. Lots of music and driving, or music and walking, or more music and more walking. Gets a little depressing from there. Storyline is a good one, could have been a much better movie. Was interested in seeing how they ended it, and then was disappointed."
4,Surprisingly good movie!,"I decided to watch the movie on Netflix because Keanu Reeves was in it and I'm glad I did. While the plot slows down quite a bit, it still seems to have the proper pacing for the story being told.Keanu plays Henry, a man that seems almost bored with his extremely uninteresting life. He goes to work, he comes home and that's about it. He doesn't have any goals and seems to be numb or indecisive about his feelings toward his current life including his wife. He's the guy that wants to make others happy and goes along with whatever comes his way.During the movie you see Henry finally decide on a goal.. finally know what he wants in life. He has a purpose and eventually feelings and opinions about what's going on around him and the people around him.This is a good movie to watch and Keanu along with the rest of cast are very good."
5,Fun!,I was lucky enough to see tis at the Woodstock Film Festival in 2010 and been awaiting its release so I could buy a copy. Loved it the first time. Loved it the second time.
3,Was hoping for better,"Well I must admit to being disappointed, it was an average film that I felt, fell flat with the ending."
5,Grandchild LOVES Boca and the songs!!!!,"What a wonderful and upbeat product!! We purchased this DVD for our 11 month old granddaughter. Jess will sit, bounce to the music and holds out her hands for Boca to reappear. The way the DVD is set up allows her mom to show just a room at a time, or go a bit longer if her attention holds up. Boca is entertaining, lively, and fun to watch. We feel the music is great, with easy to learn lyrics. What a great learning experience this provides for the young child. Keep it up Boca Beth!!!!"
2,Boring visual with cheap puppet.,"This is a boring dvd for a 2 year old. It introduces some words and occasionally add a senstense which I think is too long and difficult to learn. All words and sentences will only prononce once or twice. The word on screen is kind of small to see (with a 18'' tv). Not sure about the spanish quality since I'm not a Spanish native speaker. In conclusion, it's kind of on the boring side and I won't recommend it. Try ""kids love Spanish"" instead. It's not perfect but I think it's better than this one."
5,powerfull,"let me tell you about these two actors in this movie they were so good i wonder if hollywood know to make movies they were very, very, good."
3,"Not bad, but we're too used to the original","The Batman Forever score (like the movie) was different than the previous two installments. Goldenthal's themes and instruments introduced a new, jazzier type of Batman music. Many thought Danny Elfman's original Batman theme was one of the best ever. The music was so colossal, it was hard to imagine a Batman movie without the theme that we are so used to hearing. Goldenthal did what he could. The Batman Forever score is not bad at all. In fact, it is good music. The only problem is that Danny Elfman's music for Batman is just simply better. For this reason, many fans did not accept this score. Still, there are enough tracks on the CD to make this worth buying if you are a Batman fan. Opening titles, and the final two tracks are very good while they express heriosm and the ""new"" theme."
4,The ship that could not sail,"Goldenthal's score here is wonderfully bombastic. However, the music clearyly overwhelms the film (which isn't nessesarily a bad thing). It's not a typical ""Batman"" score, more Goldenthal's interpretation of what the whole bat-thing is(loud, spectacle, grand, playful, fantastic, unrealistic). I find the track ""Under the Tent""(I believe that's what it's called)to be great. Anyway, just my two cents!"
3,We want Elfman!,"This soundtrack overall isn't too bad, but I think I speak for everybody when I say that Danny Elfman portrayed the entire spirit of the Dark Knight better than Goldenthal. To his credit, he did as well as could be expected with the film, which was a disapointment. The track ""The Pull of Regret"" was one of my favorites. It reminds me of his work on ""Interview with the Vampire"" which was a better score in my opinion."
3,Bat-who?,"Not too bad a soundtrack when accompanying the movie, but too much has changed between film and score to appreciate either. Dark Batman seems a hollow memory and Goldenthal's score seems an odd mockery of it's passing. Still, it's a good CD to pop in while driving. There is definately some Bat-gusto there. A new director for the films just led for less to work with. Nice attempt, Mr. Goldenthal."
3,Unsatisfactory.,"After buying this CD, I felt the deep difference between the previous two Batman movies and the third. While the first one was darkly heroic and the second almost dramatic, this is simple substandard action music. And the worst, not dark but light-hearted. The Batman theme here is just a fanfare, and the villain themes are very weak. While the Penguin's theme was enjoyably sad and the Catwoman's twisted but fun, here, the Riddler's theme is very silly and the Two-Face music is slightly better, but too ordinary. And one of the worst tracks has to be Mr.E's Dance Card, which makes me to beg for Elfman to Return. However, this CD is worth buying, if you have the cash, only for the reason to appreciate the Elfman soundtracks more."
3,Review,"This was a good score for Batman Forever but i do miss Danny Elfman as being the composer of the Batman films. Elliot Goldenthal in this score uses different tones, and alot of banging. There are only a few tracks that are good in this CD like: Main Titles & Fanfare , Chase Noir , Descent , and Spank Me! Overture. This is a good CD but be careful you may not like it."
2,Weird and disturbing,"I want Danny Elfman back! Neither of Goldenthal's Batman scores can compare with the original Batman (although Batman and Robin compares favorably with Batman Returns). For a better buy, grab a hold of the bootleg/promo of Batman and Robin. This CD is just too bizarre. It is a totally incoherent listen. Buy Batman (Danny Elfman). You will definitely be satisfied with that."
3,"Good cable, but crappy spooling and pull box",Cable is good and thick with the required double braiding and double shielding. My particular pull box had the wire spun overlapping itself which made pulling from the box a PITA. I would not buy this cable again simply because it comes in a pull box and I was unable to pull from the box.
1,Run away! Run away!,"Don't waste your money on this one.I happily (because I didn't waste my money) borrowed this from a local academic library. I'm glad I read it, because I learned a lot about what I don't like.Bloom doesn't like Lord of the Rings, so why he even bothers to assemble these old, dated, and tired essays is beyond me, unless it is to make money off the LOTR craze. His one-page introduction is an insult; he doesn't ever explain why he included any of the essays in this collection nor does he contribute any insight regarding Tolkien's work (I suspect he didn't have any).I was amused, then annoyed by what he included: outdated Jungian comparisons to the Hobbit, a poorly-written history of the publication of Lord of the Rings. The one notable exception is Tom Shippey's chapter from Road to Middle Earth, but you're better off reading Shippey's book, or any of his books, than wasting your time with this one."
5,Three for the Kings of the High Elves. . .,"This book presents an excellent interpretation of the works of J.R.R. Tolkein. It adds an interesting prespective on his stories, as well as his life. This is a must have for any true Tolien fan! Peace."
3,Covered Chicken Fryer,"Generally satisfied - looks good, cooks evenly. The one drawback is that the lid handle (knob) is not insulated from the lid itself, so that the lid handle can get pretty hot."
1,I do not like the pan,The bottom of the pan is not flat and only bows more as heat is applied making the pan unsable. There is a seam that runs the length of the bottom side of the handle which makes it uncomfortable to hold the pan.
2,missing important information in the book!,"The book is really not all that comprehensive. I wish the author would spell out in a nice outline form or create a primer for licensing an invention. I found that certain sections, such as about utility patent was unclear. I was even more surprised to discover that the author does not even discuss a sell sheet, which is very important to present to an licensee. It would be nice to have a sample sell sheet included in the provided CD, which has some useful forms. Instead, I have to research on the internet about sell sheets and other information associated with licensing."
5,"Extraordinarily well written, easy to read with great advice in keeping with the Nolo Branding of simplifying the Law","My first Nolo book and really did not disappoint.The book is well laid out,easy to follow and has excellent case studies, hints and links to external information. Integration with the Nolo web site for more information and connections (e.g. Lawyer directory) provides a very complete experience.Absolutely first class."
4,So much info that you have to read it slow but it is really good,"I am such a fan of the NOLO series that I'll pick up one of their books just to read it and learn something new.Such as it was for ""Profit From Your Idea"". I have no ideas to profit from. I'm just not that imaginative. But if I were, I'd want to have this book. Author Stim takes the reader from licensing to getting a good idea if your idea is worth raising hopes for.The chapters are bursting with information. Chapter 9 - Money Matters took me a week to read through. Not because the writing was clunky or hard to comprehend but simple because it had so much information.I definitely recommend this book for anyone who has a great idea and wants to look at licensing it for profit. Definitely worth a read."
1,Smoke a cigarette instead........,"From the man who gave us Black Friday comes a nonsensical movie. John Abraham plays a guy who is full of himself and a chain smoker. His wife played by Ayesha Takia threatens to walk out on him if he does not give up his smoking habit. So he employs the services of Baba Bengali, a tantric played by Paresh Rawal. What happens after he goes to Baba Bengali is the film.I just wasted two hours of my life watching this horrific film which was absolutely meaningless in my opinion. The only reason that I watched this movie was that it featured the names Vishal Bharadwaj and Anurag Kashyap. Watching NO smoking is seriously injurious to your brain. I gave it one star 12/26/09"
1,Disappointing,"I tried to use this software to restore the sound quality to my vinyl records before burning to CD. This product is truly unusable. It takes minutes and minutes to do the simplest task. Unless you have unlimited time and unlimited patience, do not buy this product. A far better product at a much lower cost is Magix Audio Cleaning Lab. Today, Jul 10, 2004, Audio Cleaning Lab 3 is only $9.95."
1,Not compatible with Windows 7,"I've been using this product for years under XP and liked it. However, when I recently bought a new computer with Windows 7, it wouldn't install. And, apparently, the web site isn't there any more to get some kind of update. It served me well, but it's time to move on to a product that keeps up with the times."
2,Not Even Hiding Will Help You Survive,"This book is incredibily slow and nothing much happens. There are about four people in the book - Lissa, Mother, Father & Josh. It is totally obivious from the start who is trying to kill Lissa, and even she knows. The relationship between Lissa & Josh and Mother & Father are totally unrealistic. This book is best kept at the back of the book shelves !!!"
2,ALAN POPPER,"MR POPPER WAS TREMENDOUS IN HIS SECOND FEATURE. HE CONTROLLED THE SCENE WITH HIS AFFINITY FOR ACTION.HIS APPEAL IS LIMITLESS,AND EVOKES THOUGHTS OF JAMES DEAN."
2,good and bad,"I bought this for my girl back home.she was very happy to recieve it,called it pretyy and said that she simply loved it.she wore it one day and the chain broke.I am very upset.I hate having to buy extra things just to fix the item I originally bought to try to make it better.I should come brand new and well made.lets face it who like to buy faulty items.On the upside the rose was very beautiful she said.so unless you wanna buy an extra more expensive chain do not wast your time."
1,"Receive as a gift, VERY disappointed","I had this item on my wish list for a couple years and finally got it this Christmas from my Brother in Law. I was SO disappointed! It looks like it was made in the dark or by a 2 year old. The red on the roses was uneven and missing at the top of the large rose. It just looks really bad! The pewter is fine, no issues with that and as most necklaces, the chain is crap. I am sad that whoever made this didn't care how it was going to look."
3,Nice but not spectacular,"I'm glad that I had the customer images as a baseline, because it did not look much like their advertising image. If you want to know what it looks like, check out the customer images before buying. In addition, the chain (which I don't like much anyway) has two kinks in it, and it was threaded backwards (for a lefty not a righty, and righty is standard).Update 8/27/11: As it turns out, this has become one of my favorite pieces. The chain is still kinked but I've gotten used to putting it on backwards."
4,Beautiful necklace,I love this necklace. It's beautiful and works with casual or dress clothing. It's a good accent to any outfit or can act as the center of attention. I've had lots of compliments about it and wear it often.
2,Not very impressive Not like the pic,"I thought this would be much bigger and better made. To be honest, it kind of looks like it came out of a gumball machine. I would give this to a little kid, but never an adult. I kept it, but it is expensive for what you get. Looks cheap and not as nice as I had hoped."
4,Cool Necklace,"I ordered this the week before Christmas. they shipped the next day and arrived in time without paying the extra recommended shipping. The box is cool, the necklace is well detailed the only negative is the red enamel. either a better job applying the red or just leave it off all together it really doesn't need it anyways. Good for an inexpensive gift."
4,Happy!,We installed this product as soon as we got it. It looks good in the kitchen. Was easy to install. We had to purchase toggle bolts because where we wanted to hang it did not have a stud. It is nice to be able to easily adjust the height. We are happy customers.
4,pot rack,"Good quality, well made and easy to install. Comes complete with all necessary hardware to hang. The hardest part of installation is locating ceiling joists."
4,great buy,my wife and i were very satisfied with this product. the hardware seems pretty sturdy and its a simple setup.
4,Quick shipping & easy setup,"I received this item faster than I expected (opted for free shipping but it came in about 2 days!). I put hanging it up for awhile because I've never done something like this before and was honestly a bit intimidated. Nothing to worry about! I'm happily enjoying a beer for a job well done! Just be sure to read the directions (very short & easy) from start to finish before you begin and make sure you find your studs on first drill. I used an 11/64 drill bit for pilot holes and it worked perfectly!Awesome product, easy install and fast shipping = happy customer!"
1,"Missing Parts, Manufacturer Never Responds","This item is great for small kitchens. I purchased because we wanted a place to hang some of our pots, etc. to give us some more room. I received this product in excellent packaging, however, some parts were missing. I contacted the manufacturer several times over 3 months and never received a response. The quality of what I did receive is great, after having to run to a local home improvement store to purchase the additional parts.Update 3/28/12: The missing parts were hooks to hang pans, etc. were not included so that makes this useless. I should not have to purchase parts separately. Since this review the paint started chipping as well. The company still does not respond. This is not good quality at all and I would not recommend this brand to anyone as this is a permanent fixture in your kitchen once you start bracing to your ceiling."
1,Amazon great per usual but Innova a ZERO,"I received the item promptly per Amazons fine service however found the hanging hardware missing. I called the customer service line of the manufacturer. (The instructions stated that if the product was missing anything to call them.) I was rudely told that they didn't have anything to do with it and to call Amazon for a return authorization. This is a heavy, bulky item and frankly not worth the effort or cost to return. I went the hardware store and bought the parts. If you order anything from this manufacturer keep your fingers crossed. I cannot recommend them in any way. This does not refelect on Amazon.com"
1,Not wrought,"Cast iron is a low carbon iron poured into a mold to make a product, wrought iron is cast iron that is worked into a form. This is not wrought nor cast iron - this is rolled steel; just a thicker version of bent and welded sheet metal. I am not complaining about the rack itself, just don't think you are getting a great deal on a wrought iron pot rack. This is just typical made in China and mislabeled to sell more. YOU HEAR ME AMAZON AND INNOVA - I SEE WHAT YOU DID HERE AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD"
4,Nice pot rack man!,Looks nice and functionality is great. Sturdy and well built. installation was a breeze. great price and a fast ship.Thanks
4,Nice pot rack,I love the pot rack. It would have gotten a solid five stars if it came with all the hardware I needed to hang it. One star was lost for making me drive to a hardware store during a storm for drywall anchors that should have been in the box.
5,LOVE IT,everyone comments on my kitchen for this rack!! It definitely looks good with all my pots and pans. Chains got replaced for bigger and longer ones because they seem so thin and weak i was afraid it will fall.
4,Lots of bang for buck,I just could not see spending all that money for some of the higher priced pot racks. This one is of high quality and was easy to install. I really like it and it gets the job done.
5,Just perfect,This pot hanger is exactly as advertized! So rare when ordering sight unseen. It is the perfect size and configeration and very well made. I could not ask for more
2,Only 3 holes?,This item just arrived in from UPS today. I was very excited to finaly get this pot rack. Then I discovered that there are only 3 pre-drilled holes in the rack to hang it with.... There are supposed to be 4. How does that even leave the factory like that. Do they not have a quality control guy who makes sure that all the racks have 4 holes to hang the rack by? I have not yet decided if I will return the item or take the chance of drilling the hole myself... I'm definitely disappointed.
4,NOT BAD,Not bad for the price. I recieved the package with all listed hardware but I did end up buying 4 toggle bolt/hook setups from my local hardware store to save time and hassle locating the studs in the ceiling.It is a great looking addition to my Kitchen!!!
5,Love this rack....,This rack is economical and great. I got so many compliments for the rack. Infact all my friends were surprised when they learned that it costs around $ 40. Definitely recommend this rack.
5,I love this pot rack!,"After looking around several times and for a long time, I decided to take a chance on this pot rack. I just have one word: Amazing! I love this pot rack, it looks beautiful in my kitchen, installation was pretty quick and easy, it's exactly what I was looking for and the price couldn't be better. Complete accesories, 12 hooks enough for me, beutiful design, I can recommend this product without any doubts."
4,Nice look. Good Value,"There is a seam in the center where the metal meets. A slight, barely noticable detail. Great deal. Silver grate looks good with black iron. Looks like picture. Includes hanging hooks."
4,Great value,"I just moved into a new house with a nice, big kitchen. It has the perfect spot for a pot rack, and I decided to give this one a try. It looks nice, and it does the job. My only complaint about its functionality is that it's pretty rattly. If the kids are running around upstairs it makes a lot of noise. To reduce this, we took a rubber shelf liner and cut small rectangles out of it, and padded the wire rack in the middle. This greatly cut down on the noise. The other issue is that it did not come with the hardware to install it. It has the hooks, but no anchors of any kind. For something hanging pots from the ceiling, you've got to use anchors."
5,Nice Rack!,"This is a very solid piece that is a very good value for the money. Simple, very but very nice!"
5,Keeps pots & pans handy and out of the way,"Well-made, will last for years. Pans should keep their non-stick coatings unmarred for a substantially longer period. We used to have them, as most people do, stacked within one another ( separated by paper towels in our case ). AAAHNK...no more!"
4,Good rack,"This is a great rack, similar to those that cost three of four times more than this one does. The whole rack is heavy duty but still looks good.As suggested by others, I spray painted the chain black but this is purely a cosmetic change."
5,I was very skeptical.,"We got a new set of Cuisinart cookware and my husband wanted to put it on a rack over the sink island. I wasn't happy about hanging pots and pans in view of everone. (Course my former cookware was Reverware and cast iron. Not nice looking for hanging.) So after looking for weeks at stores and on line we decided on this one. Mostly it was the price (one we could afford) and that it was black. We have a log house and some of our beams have black braces and our light tracks are black. So when we received it we tried it over the sink island and then over the the counter with the window. That is where it had to go so I would be able to reach it. (I,m not real tall.) I would have had to get a runt stump (step ladder). At any rate it worked perfectly and saved so much cabinet space. It made out kitchen look much more interesting!! We wanted to break out the wine and cheese!!Would reccommend this item to everyone wanting to try a rack.Sheryl W."
4,Love the pot rack - did have to get different chains,"The chains weren't near long enough - but we also have very high, vaulted ceilings and I'm very short. We were able to get replacement chains at Wal-Mart for very little money, which STILL made this an inexpensive pot rack.It was very easy to hang as well.I get compliments on it ever single time someone comes to my house. LOVE IT!"
2,included hardware totally inadequate,"The hardware and instructions included with this pot rack are totally inadequate. It comes with 4 screw hooks to be screwed into the ceiling. The instructions state that if you don't miraculously happen to hit joists with all 4 screws you need to 'pick up some toggle bolts at the hardware store'. No size info for the toggles is provided and as the ceiling hooks are pretty beefy it is very hard to find toggle bolts big enough to accommodate them.When you take into account the fact that this thing is 17"" wide and most american joists are placed 16"" on center it becomes apparent that really no one is going to be able to hang this thing without additional hardware.Shame on the manufacturer for not taking this into account."
3,nice piece,very bulky piece is not really suitable for a regular kitchen has 12 hooks which can be used for big pots or small spoons
4,works fine but needed extra parts,"Where I wanted it, the studs weren't located so I had to go to hardware store to get ceiling hangers for an additional $8."
5,Nice,Came with everything I needed to set up this pot rack. I like the sturdiness of it and the way it looks in my kitchen. I would but more if I could.
4,A *Must Read* for history buffs,"If you are someone who has an interest in World War II and the battles fought as well as the hows and whys of the war's outcome, you must include ""A Man Called Lucy"" on you list of required reading materials.Why did Russia lose so many battles then, suddenly begin a string of victories which turned the war?The book contains a view not only of the difficulties of establishing a circle of trusted persons who will depend on each other and begin the secret, detailed process of transferring the information, but the difficulty -- and politics -- of giving your intelligence to those who could best make use of it.From the first meeting, the Allies mistrusted Roessler and suspected he was a double agent. Not for several years did this valuable direct-from-Hitler's-mouth intelligence get to the Allied generals.Not a pulp thriller, this is a story of the hard labor and small reward of real-life intelligence work.Dave C."
3,Correct cable?,"This Y cable will not work with the CMD4 Clarion unit or the M101RXCRET extension cable. Be sure to get the corect Y cable for your unit if you are adding another remote. This Y cable works with the 'MWRXCRET' Marine Remote Extension Cable, 25 ft. These DO NOT work with Clarion CMRC2-BSS remote."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"False advertisement! Buyer beware! I returned this cross as soon as it arrived to my home. The front is cool but their is absolutley NOTHING on the other side! I can't even say that it is hollow because their is nothing behind it. If I wanted ghetto bootleg shell-jewelry, i would've went to the ghetto! This cross pendant is also OVER PRICED. I've always gave good reviews with Amazon except for this one."
5,Outstanding Debut Novel!!,"Timothy Brommer has created a vivd fantasy world, filled with a host of compelling characters. Orius Candell is a heretic priest who begins his quest from scratch to gain his rightful place on the throne of Soriazar. To do this, he has to rein in a nation of scattered and warring tribes, who hate each other as much as they hate their common enemy, the Syts.But it doesn't end there. There are other factors working against Orius' success. The Church of Ghyo, who hunts for him, and his real family, the Mendios, who seem to be the definition of dysfunction.Mr. Brommer's multi-layered plot kept the pages turning for me, with his awesome grasp of political intrigue, family strife, and one of the most spectacular battle scenes I have EVER read. He must be a reenactor or something.This new writer definitely shows off his knack for high fantasy in his debut novel. I can't wait for book two."
2,"product OK, Linksys tech support absolutely sucks","I like the product but had a question that was not answered by the documentation. I went to the Linksys web page and engaged their tech support via chat. The person at the other end, ""Randy W."" was rude and obnoxious. I then tried to email a complaint to support@ but it bounced with a message that tech support is no longer available via email. They need to re-engage email and bounce Randy out the door."
4,Linksys 5 port switch,"Switch works great! Expanded my home network to hard wire 4 more computers. This switch gave me an alternate location for tying in home computers. I have not daisy-chained another switch to th first one, but probably will soon because I'm out of available connections again. Should have gotten 7 port, but I like the option of setting up another location in the house to connect other computers."
5,Easy,"For the price, it is a good deal. A lot faster than the similar Linksys hub, and also very easy to get set up. A great addition to an existing network or just as a start."
4,great with xbox linked gaming,many people use this to connect there computers well if you own an xbox you can use it to link 4 xboxs without the need to connect to the internet with live making you spend 60 bucks instead buy this link. it lost one star for eing very bulky.
4,A breeze to install but no cable modem access!,"I bought this thinking it could work with my ISP service and a cable modem to have multiple computers share Internet access but I was dead wrong. The unit doesn't seem to allow the sharing of a single IP address and that's all my Roadrunner ISP allows for each account. So, if you're in SoCal and are with Roadrunner, I suggest you get a router. Linksys has a decently affordable one--the Linksys BEFSR41 4-Port Etherfast Cable/DSL Router. Check it out. But not to beat this puppy with a shovel, it's not a bad switch. File transfer rates between computers through the switch aren't too bad and it's a cinch to install. Just remember to check all your network settings. Peace out."
2,Broke,Stopped working after 3 days....Amazon made it easy to get a replacement but I had to pay an extra 7 bucks to ship it back to Amazon :(The new one has been working fine for about 2 months now
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought two of these routers 2-3 yrs ago and I had intermittent problems with the computers loosing connection with the router and I think one of the ports was dead on arrival and other died sometime in the last few months.In the last couple of days my staff complained of very slow connection and loss of connection to the router which was corrected on unpowering the device and repowering .But today both my servers lost connection to the router and trouble shooting took a lot of valuable time while my patients were waiting and I had to get a new switch but a different make to connect to the router. It is very frustrating and I do not have time to contact tech support because most of the time ,I am connected to somebody who I think is reading from a script and half the time I get the impression they do not know what they are talking about especially if the support is from US.I have decided that I won't buy or recommend Linky's products to anyone!Peter"
3,different from the picture,"maybe i didnt read the description well,but i recevived something different from the picture, but it works, it's all what matters, but the picture must be updated, because it looks nicer than the picture."
2,Has high failue rate,"As others have mentioned, these units seem to fail at an exordinary rate. It would seem that Linksys 5-port switches are affected, though there may be others. I've personally seen one completely fail and another three with issues. Of the three, the common theme was high packet loss. I finally replaced the two I owned with a Linksys/Cisco SRW244G4 managed switch. My network performance & stability improved significantly. Plus the 4 gigabit port were an added bonus. Personally, I'd avoid buying any of the consumer-grade switches Linksys sells. Go with Netgear, DLink, etc. If you're looking for a business-grade managed switch, the Linksys/Cisco ones seem well built and trouble-free.If you already bought one of Linksys's 5-port switches and it currently works fine, keep it cool! Setup a fan if need be. They seems to throw a lot of heat and my guess is there not very tolerant of high temperatures (or moderate ones over long periods)."
5,Works great...even dasiy chained to another switch,Cisco makes networking easy because their products just work right out of the box. I got exactly that with this switch which allowed me to plug in several networking devices with one ethernet source. I have this dasiy-chained to the big 16-port hub and everything works like a dream with issues and no set-up time at all.
3,Will NOT work with XBOX Live!,"I purchased this switch because we have two desktops, a laptop, XBOX Live, and a PS2 broadband adapter - the latter three of which are in my bedroom. I didn't want to have three wires running from my router in the hallway into my bedroom, so I thought a switch would be the way to go. [For those who don't know, hubs divide the bandwidth between all connected devices, while switches will distribute 100 mbps to EACH connected device. An important factor for online gaming.] This little switch, and I DO mean little, is very compact, attractive and seems well-built. I felt very excited by its appearance upon opening it. Unfortunately, it did not serve my purpose as it would not work with XBOX Live. It worked seemlessly with my laptop and PS2 though, so if it's needed for computers only, I think it's an excellent little switch and would rate it a 5."
5,Great upgrade,"I upgraded my home network from a 10mbs hub to the 10/100 mbs switch. Just plugged the wires in and off it went. The only mistake I made was not checking Amazon first, their price is incredible. If your interested in sharing the internet, a file server, or gaming this is the right switch at the right price."
2,"Gamers go elsewhere, otherwise ok","I work in IT and had heard decent remarks about this switch. I purchased the switch about a month ago and had no problems with simple SOHO networking, but then some guys from work came over for a Quake 3 and Rainbow 6 LAN party, huge disappointment. We ended up using a hub instead and everything ran fine. You have to leave a message for Linksys tech support to call you back and i have been waiting now for 3 days. I have the 1 port router from Linksys and its great, but the switch is headed back to best buy."
1,Terrible Quality Control,"Within a month of purchase, 2 of the 5 channels on this switch were dead. This is unacceptable quality control on such a simple device."
1,Watch Out for Tech Support Costs!!!,"They had free support until just very recently. My beef is with the EXTREME cost of support, 3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!! I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support before this recent change of events. I have had my Linksys router for 3 years. I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well. I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address. You will need tech support now and again when you change ISPs, go elsewhere."
2,Somewhat,"The product was new and there was no shipping cost, but that did not matter because the product was not available. However I was not notified until a week after I had ordered the product."
3,place in wrong search,I wanted a wireless router. This is what came up in the search. Not at all what I wanted
1,What's the point of this switch,"This was supposed to be a switch because sometimes I use the computer and othertimes my PS3. Everytime you want to use it you have to unplug the cable modem because it cant see the connection. What's the point of this switch, if it forgets constantly that you have a connection. Kinda dumb idea for a product."
5,"Works, not much else to say.","Use it in my home office, been working flawlessly since I hooked it up. Setup interface is easy to understand and configure. Linksys make great products. Buy with confidence."
5,"inexpensive, seamless","You can only go so wrong with a cheap, dependable switch. No trouble installing it, no troubles since. Gave me a cheap way of expanding my network without having to buy a bigger ($$$) router."
5,Well well well! Blew me away completely!,"Having been hooked up via a Netgear hub for the past two years, I wondered if I could gain any networking improvements by installing a switch. I was concerned by some articles relating to their 'configuration' however. Well, as one reviewer has already said, ""it took longer to take it out of the box than to install it!"". Hooked up the four workgroup PCs and VOILA........everything just came back up as though nothing had been altered, EXCEPT for the new SPEEEEEED!Don't hesitate on buying this little beauty!"
5,5-port switch,"this was a quick, easy way to give me the extra slots on my network I needed. It was as easy as plugging it in and connecting to the existing router, and then hooking up whatever devices I needed to add to it. Works great!"
4,Linksys Workgroup Switch,Worked Great with my two Vista Computers. I had a rough time finally getting it to work with my XP Laptop.
4,Great product,I've used this product for years and continue to do so. The brand is reliable and it does what it's supposed to. It's not much more than a generic brand switch and I find it very reliable. I use it personally and for my clients.
5,What's not to like?,"It does what it's supposed to do, it's trivially simple to get it to work (plug it in, connect the cable), and it works. Lasts forever, no problems, what's not to like?"
1,$20 gone.,"I think they labeled this device wrong,instead of saying ""5-port switch"",it's a actually a magical device that converts your high-speed broadband internet into dial-up.My internet is usually quite fast,at around 60mb/s,but this wonderful little black box crippled that to an unholy 400kb/s.I could barely even load up amazon.It also refused to connect itself to my Xbox 360,out of jealousy,I presume.This is the faultiest product I've ever bought from amazon,and I've bought Clive Barker's Jericho.Look somewhere else if you're looking for a switch."
1,Linksys EZXS55W EtherFast 10/100 5-Port Workgroup Switch,The switch arrived ontime and works as expected. The power supply block died after a few hours of work. Very disappointing
2,Mac users: Does not work with AppleTalk,"If you are a Macintosh user, you should know of a very important limitation of all Linksys hubs & switches, including this one: This switch will NOT route AppleTalk information on your network. What that means is that if you are a Macintosh user who is trying to use file sharing via AppleTalk, or if you have an older AppleTalk printer (such as the older line of HP LaserJet printers), you will be out of luck with this switch... or any Linksys hub/switch. Besides the lack of Macintosh AppleTalk support, this switch seems to work just fine."
1,Terrible Switch--Shame on you Linksys,"I have noticed the gradual decline in Linksys product quality over the last couple of years, and this switch is the absolute worst product I have seen yet. We bought this switch for our office to handle a couple of network printers, and over the last two months, two of the ports are comletely dead and a third one is starting to go. What gives? Sorry, but this one is getting exchanged for another vendor's switch...I also have a WRT54G V2 wireless router that does cirles around the new V6 we bought. Not only does the V6 drop connection more often but it has other strange behavior as well. We had a power blip at our remote location and the router totally shut down and rebooted itself into factory default mode. Not to mention that they have downgraded the internal memory, etc. Product support is a joke too. Linksys, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?"
2,d-link switch better,I've used both d-link and linksys switches.They both fail after a time. The d-linkseems to be a faster switch. I keep thinkingCisco would have would host the premierproduct. Oh well
2,Random death,"After upgrading to all Gigabit networking, I ended up using this router as a small local router for my Tivo. It was fine for several years and then it just died a few days ago. Only port 5 shows activity any longer - ports 1-4 are dead. I've never had a router fail like this before (and I have 5 in my current home network in various places all over the house).I was using the original transformer that came with it and measured the voltage - it was pumping out 10.6v under no load and 9.5v when connected to the Linksys. That's 26% over the proper voltage (7.5v)! It's quite possible that over-powering the unit during it's lifetime would have shortened its life."
4,"great pictures, non-arabic letters","There are 16 stickers in this book. Each one is a realistic color drawing of a creature found in the sea. For example: a whale, a squid, a shark, a turtle, a penguin, a starfish, a seal, a walrus, etc. Each sticker is numbered, and the numbers correspond to a key in the back of the book.However, the cover, the majority of the index page, and the key in the back are all written in oriental characters. I'd like to be able to pass along more information then that, but I don't know enough about non-Arabic characters to say whether they're Japanese or Chinese (and, in fact, would not be surprised if someone were to inform me that they were something else entirely).The stickers themselves are fun and clearly drawn, so I'm not dissapointed!"
5,A Great Compilation,"This DVD is a family favorite at our house. Our 3 year old is a huge Hi-5 fan and she loves this DVD. It includes songs from Robot Number One, Five Senses, So Many Animals and North South East and West. It includes classic episodes such as Building a Fence and Pizza, Pizza Pizza with Jen and Chats. You will love this DVD!"
2,Cuter guys needed,My daughter can't really talk yet but she shows more interest in the current Australian version.But I personally think my 1.5yr old daughter prefers the two cuter Aussie guys than these two American boys.:)
1,Will not Fit,"In the Item Fits page for these headers, it states will fit the 98 Ford Crown Victoria. Bull Crap. Mustangs ONLY. Fix your description Gibson."
5,Shea Butter Balm,"Shea Butter Balm is superior to any other I've ever used, it really does leave your hands butter soft, and the scent of Shea Butter balm is truly beautiful and long lasting, once you use this balm you'll discover that it surpasses any other you've tried, and if you believe that you deserve the ""best"" Shea Butter Balm is exactly, ""that""."
2,"The ""Wet Blanket Guide to L.A.""","I always buy the Rough Guide series when I'm traveling to a new city. It's English perspective is refreshing and the books are always well written. The problem with this writer is an obvious disgust with America and even more so he makes a trip to Disneyland sound like a visit to a landfill. My wife's spirits were crushed when she read his condescending, dim, hateful view of American Legend Walt Disney's magical park nearly ending our vacation there. Walt just wanted the huddled masses to enjoy his work...make us all feel better. This writer does not. After reading this book for 5 minutes you will be likely to cancel your trip. Too bad because most of the Rough Guide travel series is top shelf."
1,"More pretentious than dull, or vice versa?",It's hard to decide what's worse about this book: the pretentiousness of the author or the dullness of the vignettes that reveal it.You also have to wonder what Amy's husband made of her flirtations with Attila. The book comes off as a major indirect insult to that poor fellow! Or maybe he just didn't care.
2,Merely going through the motions,"2 1/2This sounds like a pretty bland outing of country-rock for me, especially given Dylan's songwriting abilities around that exceptional time period. While most songs are competent enough to satisfy small expectations, a distinct feeling of the artist on autopilot lingers throughout, even if that pilot is the exceedingly talented singer-songwriter."
4,You don't have to worry anymore.,"This was the album that Bob Dylan released after his motorcycle accident. The previous few albums had been rock albums, but this is a country/folk album. It has very sparse acoustic instrumentation. Solid songs, Dylan fans will dig it."
5,John Wesley Harding by Bob Dylan,The old tunes are the best. My original vinyl doesn't play anymore and this sounds like the original. Dana Van Valin in Colorado
5,Mellow with deep meaning.,"This CD is excellent all around, it is mellower than some of the previous albums and has a countryish sound to it. All of the songs provide some deep lyrics and with some great music to go along with them. I like Hendrix's electric cover of All Along the Watchtower, but it is awesome to hear the original that Dylan created in an acoustic manner with such power, which is never played on radio airwaves. This is one of my personal favorites from Dylan, similar in some ways to Nashville Skyline (with more country sound), New Morning (with a vocal jazz sound), and Self Portrait (Dylan's self confessed cover album), which I highly recommend if you enjoyed this album."
4,John Wesley Harding,"John Wesley Harding being Dylan's 1967 release and his 8th studio album is one of Dylans most accessible albums to date. The lyrics are simple and to the point and does not included many strange allusions as he sometimes does on other albums. Songs such as I dreamed I saw St. Augustine, All along the watchtower are great tracks that just happen to follow one another on the album. All along the watchtower was covered by Hendrix in 1968. The book-let has a cover photo of Dylan with a bunch poorly dressed men. I like the photo on back with Dylan singing. It looks so nice and natural. Inside we have a strange little story. I have no idea what it is about. 4/5."
1,I couldn't have been more disappointed,"Its network cards were a poor fit, each taking 5 times the normal time to install them in the machine. The LAN software only has email support, and it was slow and poor. Both machines were running Windows 98. Frequent reboots now plague both, clients often fail to find the server.Most game programs seem to have problems using the connection. The only thing running with success are basic browsers.Overall, a complete waste of money."
1,Linksys support is totally worthless!!,"I have a Linksys Homelink network system that has now been unusable for months. When I upgraded to Windows ME, the only problem I had was with the Linksys card. Neither phone support or email support has been able to fix the problem. Email support rarely returns any messages, and if they do, all they say is they are working on the problem. I have four computers and a laptop and all were working decently on the network before upgrading to ME - not good, just decently - but what is so discouraging is the lack of support. I will NEVER buy another Linksys product!"
4,Networked Small Business with These,"Much to the chagrin of the local computer networking company who had hoped to completely rewire the old house we bought for our office for an ethernet network, these cards work fine. We are running a 733 with windows 98, 533 with 98, and a 200 with 95. I'm going to be adding two more computers in the near future and will report back on that. No significant problems although I had to pull all of the cards from one computer because the order they were inserted in was important-- I think the winmodem in that computer was using a resource that didn't show up in the control panel."
1,would not install,I spent 6 months off and on trying to install the adapter cards onto my Win98SE computers. Windows could never find the driver from the CD nor from the two files sent by LinkSys tech support.I then bought the Netgear wireless MA311 cards; they installed perfectly and network is running the same day I took it out of the box.
4,A Good Primer on Fender Basses,"The 50th anniversary of the first Fender Precision Bass is closely approaching. Klaus Blasquiz has detailed the first 40 years of development of the two principal electric basses -- the Precision Bass and the Jazz Bass -- and has included ample information about other basses produced by Fender. Abundantly illustrated (including four solid pages of color photos), both common and unusual models are displayed in catalog shots, detail closeups and in the hands of bassists who have favored Fender. If you are looking for production lists, this is not your book. However, if you are looking for a thorough history of Fender basses, this book will leave you well satisfied."
2,Buy the J.W. Black & Albert Molinaro book instead,"Klaus Blasquiz's book is a noble effort, but weak on details, weak on pictures and unbelievably weak on editing and proofreading. One gets the impression that English is not his first language - and the fact that nobody fixed this in editing is unforgiveable in a ""professional"" reference book. I recently got the Black and Molinaro book, it's WAAAY better with lots of luscious photos."
1,A waste of money,"This book is poorly researched, badly written and with a questionable selection of photographs. The cover photo basses are not even mentioned in the text! Only upside, a few rare photos from the fifties. Normally, you get what you pay for, so put your money into one of the more serious books on the subject."
3,Not as good as some of the other Fender books,"This book isn't bad, especially when you consider the price. It does a good job with a brief history of all of the different model basses that fender has offered over the years, but the photos are small and in Black and white."
4,Mostly great,"Got this for my yearly excursion into the mountains for 3 days to kick off winter. Filled easily and did not leak. I had to fill and drain this about a dozen times to try to get that bleach/rubber taste out of it. It never fully got rid of that taste, however, in the cold, the water tastes great. My biggest problem: The ""insulated"" tube froze. It went down to between 22 and 17 where I had camped and the reservoir got extremely slushy and the tube completely froze. So if you're going out in the cold, try to keep it shielded from the wind. After I thawed it on a tree near our fire, I wrapped it in fleece sweatpants and put it in my tent and it didn't freeze again."
4,Winter hydration,"I bought this item as a hydration bladder for my ski backpack. The original I had in there was not a ""winter"" bladder, and regularly froze up in typical Minnesota ski temps. The item came very promptly from the supplier and was exactly as advertized. My only complaint is that the insulation around the bladder itself is a bit on the bulky side (and occupies a lot of pack space), but otherwise it really works."
3,Popes,"From what I have read so far, I find it interesting and informative. However I do find it somewhat dry."
1,Worst Ive Ever Read!!,Im sorry but this book was the WORST book I've EVER read! Mabye It's just because i dont enjoy reading about a stupid monkey that knows kung fufu and wants to live forever!!!!! It had no point!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Heavy on the Battles/Fighting, Lighter on the Wisdom","Monkey was not exactly what I was expecting. From the description, I thought this story would be heavily involved in Eastern Philosohpy, and use analogies to explain the Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucianist dogmas.Instead, the majority of the book describes the dozens of battles between monkey and various demons and spirits. The specifics/tactics of these battles are described, including weapons (axes, swords, maces, monkey's cudgel, etc.), the magical transformations used (monkey growing to 10000 feet tall, or turning into a bird, etc.), and the status of the battle (300 rounds and no-one gaining an advantage, the opponents head being chopped off, etc.).Although there is some discussion of monkey's training in ""The Way"" (with some Taoist and Confucianist ideas), and some of the Buddhist theories (right action, non-violence), the story is more focused on the adventures and battles of monkey and his master, who is searching for Buddhist scrolls."
2,So-so,"This translation of the classic Chinese novel is not nearly as good as the previous Arthur Waley edition, also available from Amazon. This edition has the adventage of being greatly simplified, and therefore may be more suitable for young readers. Fans of the Waley edition might also be interested in this edition as a source for a few slightly different stories selected from the much longer original. However, this edition eliminates much of the texture of the original and is overall much, much shorter than Waley's. Most readers would be far wiser to choose Waley's classic edition. This is a poor substitute at best, except possibly for children."
5,Good,"I always buy energizer,or maxell,national or panasonic,they are all better than batteries like duracell or sony,if you don't believe me,try yourself!!"
1,Loud and prone to failure,"We got this unit from Wine Enthusiast. We were very disappointed because it was noisy and required repeated repair calls.It is now out of warranty, and we are going to have to pay again to have it fixed. It failed also during the warranty period.It costs WAY too much for this sort of miserable performance.But it does look nice, and does keep the wine at the right temperature.Too bad about the rest."
5,just great,Excellent film about a great city. Lots of rare original film and photo material used. An interesting and fresh approach of the history of NY (and the USA).
3,Just ok!,Was looking forward to seeing this movie. Was very disappointed.This movie could have and should have been much better. It was just above low budget with the acting and flow. Some of the actors seemed so robotic with their acting and lines which took away from the quality of the movie and made it hard to watch.
3,Jury please!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jury please I'm not going down for nobody..... I'm not snitching, but hey I'm not about to play the law to help anyone. The dialogue was a lil slow at first, but let's just say if your my nemesis I will not let you give me a drink of any kind! Overall this movie could have use something that pop. It was okay!"
2,Jury of our peers,I got the movie to see Bryce and the beautiful house it was filmed in .I am acquainted with him and the owner of the house. I was disappointed in the movie.
3,Geyser Life: Hardly Old Faithful,"Ed Hardy has written an engaging book. Drawing from some of his life experiences, both as a youth in the Fingerlakes region of New York and as a journalist and newspaper reporter, his portrait of a dysfunctional family was engaging and humorous even if it sometimes hit too close to home. I found myself hoping, for the authors sake, that the familial relationships portrayed in the book were purely fictional. Discerning readers should enjoy the change of style vs. the sometimes overblown and gimmicky fiction on many of the best seller lists. It was a difficult book to put down. I'm looking forward to Mr. Hardy's next novel."
2,Children's Book?!,"Paul Shipton is a good writer - the plot and characters are engaging and interesting. However, the story was ruined for our family in the twelfth chapter on page 79 when the main character curses - I find this extremely inappropriate in a children's book. Honestly the word could have been easily omitted and not have changed the flow of the story at all. Very disappointed."
3,Well its not horrible,"I had heard the Alligator album before someone mentioned that I give the Boxer a listen. I love Alligator for so many reasons yet when I got ahold of the Boxer I felt it was music that had been stripped of its ""edge"".Granted there are some beautiful, lovely songs on this album. I definatley will not be returning it to the CD Warehouse as used music. But, I miss the fun, the cocky attitude, the occasional yelling or strange back up vocals. I felt that The National probably has a lot of musical friends they could have tapped into... to really spice this album up. But I really feel this album is your favorite soda gone flat.I enjoy it, but I dont LOVE it. It's not a total waste of money but dont expect anything too exciting or really seductive in the Boxer."
4,Go National!,"A friend told me about this band a while back, and I regret that I waited so long to buy it. ""Boxer"" has a great flow from start to finish. The production is top notch. If you are into this style of music, and are on the fence about the purchase - I say go for it. This band has made a great record which has me looking for their older material. I'm hooked."
4,Excellent!,I dragged my feet for a while before finally picking this record up. I have yet to be disappointed. Enjoy!
5,Muhammad Ali,"This album is awesome. If I left you with that it would be enough. This band has such a cool sound. There is almost complexity found in the simplicity of it. I don't know that I can explain that statement fully, but either way I would highly suggest this album along with the album High Violet. Do yourself a favor and get both. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED. This album along with High Violet is like eating fluffy pancakes with the warmest, richest maple syrup running down your throat."
4,"Great album, not great record packaging.","I love this album and it sounds amazing on vinyl. Only complaint, I would love to have thicker paper cover and 180gram vinyl."
2,Overrated and derivative,"From all the rave reviews, I expected a lot more. This isn't a bad album, but it's dull, derivative and forgettable. If you want moody, introspective rock, take a pass on the National and buy something by Joy Division, the Smiths and/or Elliott Smith."
2,Unmagnificent,"Lazy baritone with all the soulfulness of a public address announcer mumbles inaudibly through 12 songs which share roughly the same inoffensive melody while band gamely tries to create dark, urgent atmosphere. The album is politely soporific, an effect magnified by a muddy recording. Boxer is easy to forget, and I plan to do so."
2,Uninteresting and uninspired,"If you liked The National's other albums, pass on this one. It's slow, boring, and all the melodies basically sound the same. I bought it and have listened only to two songs more than once."
2,"Not bad, but not good either.","I listened to it once. I will never listen to it again. But that doesn't mean it's a bad album. Not at all. In fact I was able to sit through it without falling asleep. The production was fair and the singer reminded me of Matt Johnson from The The, albeit with a lower pitch. So, to sum up, there isn't a song I can recall but none that I hated either. I give it two stars for not making me yawn."
1,Music to sleep to...,"This album should come with a warning label to not listen to it while driving or operating heavy machinery, because it will put you to sleep. How is this good music? If you close your eyes and listen (without falling asleep), can you picture these songs as radio hits?"
1,Boring as can be,"Amazon recommended this CD to me and I found it very disappointing. The songs all sound the same. The singer seems bored and emotionless and is thus quite boring to listen to. It's one of the worst CDs I've bought in years. I definitely don't recommend it--download one song off the CD and then imagine all the others, they sound just like the one you downloaded. Save your money."
1,Never Trust Anyone Over 30,"I will never understand others' love for this record; and despite all the great reviews it's gotten I have never personally met someone who actually likes it. So let me insert a dissenting voice of caution: listen to this before you buy it. If you don't like it the first time, it is unlikely you will like it the 10th. Or at least that was my experience. Maybe it's a generational thing, but I just don't hear anything that connects emotionally (or sonically), or that is even interesting on this record; the playing is dull as mud, the lyrics pretentious. It shares with James Taylor the rare ability to be both boring and annoying."
2,Fire The Drummer(and the mixer),"I bought this on a punt, it was in the supposedly personalized Amazon recommends for you section. If memory serves me the review said it was moody and atmospheric and it's true I'm a moody, melancholic girl when it comes to music but if this is moody and atmospheric then who can tell because it's almost impossible to hear anything other than the relentless, irritating ratter-tat-tat of the generic sounding, very uninspiring drums which are on almost every track. I do suspect there is a fairly beautiful album under them somewhere and I do mean under because for some unfathomable reason the drums are at the front of the mix. On the few tracks where this is not the case the relief is palpable, the music good. I suspect that if someone could strip the drums off this album entirely there would be a gorgeous, sparse yet rich album, did they just get scared by their potential for beauty?"
4,Good album,I really like this the music is really good. The only problem is that i cant understand the singer's words he tends to mumbles that is why i have to listen to it again. But it is a nice change of pace to have a singer that does not break into falseto every second. I plan to buy this. If you want to listen to this for free to see if you like it go to aol music listen party. I was looking on there and i put it on by accident i meant to push the new Rufus Wainwright who i have no desire of buying eventhough i like him. I much rather get this which is different it sounds like a better version of Arcade fire.
3,I Think It's OK,"It seems like an OK album but I can't be sure because every time I put it on, I fall asleep."
4,"Awesome Performance, but make sure the PS is right side up!","The Linksys HUB is an awesome performer. It's autosensing capabilites make local LAN and WAN traffic fly!Just make sure the power supply is right side up(Rubber dots down) There are almost invisible vent slits on the top of the little box and mine was upside down melted! Tried to get a new one form Mfr, even faxed a picture of the adapter but still sent me the wrong one... will see how it goes still waiting.But overall, for the four months that it did work it was awesome! Just plug and go."
4,Great for home or games. Not so great for professional use.,"I run a NT 4.0 server at home (getting ready to upgrade to 2000 server) with 4 Win98, 1 NT 4.0 and 1 Win2000 Pro workstations plus a 3 port print server. I used it for about 2 weeks and upgraded to a full duplex switch. As long as I was playing games with my kids or working with small files it was great. But when it came to working with massive files (firewire video capture in the GB range) or transferring large quantities of small files (photo albums), the half duplex mode was just too slow. The full duplex switch I upgraded too speeded things up considerably but at 3 times cost."
2,Not the best for sharing a cable modem,I bought this hub after reading the reviews which said how easy it was to set up so you could share a cable modem between 2 or more computers. After I received it I checked the Linksys homepage for instructions - there were none as they are puching their 4-Port Etherfast Cable/DSL Router to do just this job. I then checked other web sites and found that I had to buy a router aswell (another $110) or pay for a second IP address ($10 a month). If you just want to share a cable modem between a couple of computers but the Linksys BEFSR41 4-Port Etherfast Cable/DSL Router instead.
1,Never buy Linksys product if you may need technical help,"I have linksys 4-port router and 8-port hub at home. Both has the capacity for 100MB ethernet. But when I transfer files from two computer locally, the maximum speed I can have is 10MBit although the 100MB LED indicators are on for both computers. I tried to call Linksys many many time, but never got through. I really hate their customer service. It seems they never want to provider technical support to customers. I strongly recommend not to buy any network products from Linksys."
3,'90s equivalent of a spotty '60s garage album....,"There are precisely THREE great songs on this album - Staring at the Sun (a minor national radio hit), Picture Made Past, and Papaya Clearance Sale. The rest of the album ranges from pretty good to terrible, though the music isn't always to blame for the latter; some of the tracks are poorly recorded and/or feature too much guitar noise (be it amp hiss or fatigue-inducing distortion). Of course, Maquee at its best still sounds stuck in the mid-'90s, when grunge was coming out of vogue musically and commercially. Unfortunately, Smile were simultaneously too quirky and too mediocre to transcend their status as flavor of the month."
3,"I have a few issues with this, but all in all pretty good","The actual body of the toy is very solid and has so far stood up to my very large two and a half year old boy. It is cute. HOWEVER.... the sound feature on this toy was VERY WEAK and died completely within two hours of opening it. My son wasn't even using it... I was pushing it. And I wasn't abusing it. ALSO there is NO way to change the batteries or take the sound box out to fix this problem. I did buy this particular toy because it was supposed to make neighing and galloping sounds. And that lasted for just under two hours. Maybe I got a defective toy, but buyer be ware. He doesn't seem to care so I am just letting bygones be bygones. The toy arrived quickly and the overall buying process was a positive one."
2,Quiet already,I bought this item not so long ago. After exactly 1 month of use (and not heavy use at that) the horse no longer makes any noise. What a disappointment! 1 month! Really? And there is no way to replace a battery!
3,ok but another stick horse from another manuf. is better,kinda flimsy. not much stuffing to the head. halter is cheap plastic that i know will not hold up long with play. small horse stick which is good for 2-3 year old that is small in stature. much prefer another stick horse i bought along with this from another manuf.
5,Appaloosa Stick Horse,"Great Item at a great price, we used these for a carnival game and the kids loved it."
5,compatable to the epson cartridges,"I have a Epson Stylud C82, and these cartridges outlasted the Epson cartridges that I was using previously, and at a better price."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I read a lot of novels and it's disappointing how few of them fall into the category of ""couldn't put it down"". Brendan Dubois' ""Betrayed"", however, was one of those few. Even though I've never been all that excited about reading stories with a Vietnam War theme, this one was different. The author's fictionalized version of what happened to the MIA's is compelling and heartrending, and escaped POW Harper's quest to win final freedom for himself and his remaining colleagues keeps the reader at the edge of his seat. DuBois keeps you guessing right till the end and the suspense never lets up. My only complaint is that the epilogue wasn't longer. If you like action and suspense, you'll like this novel."
4,No problem with the install,I installed this device simply by accepting all the defaults in the setup. I'm using an Epson 900 Stylus ink printer. It's the default printer for all the computers on my network. It's attached to a 10BaseT hub that is connected to a Linksys 4-port DSL/Cable modem router. DHCP is enabled in the router and the print server uses that for an IP address. It's all working with no problem.
3,Half-arsed product,"As a fan of Linksys network devices, I'm very disappointed in this one. For starters, figuring out how to configure the unit to do CUPS-like printing was very difficult - it took googling to figure out the exact path to the printer, because the documentation I got was outdated. While the server allows disabling older printing protocols like NetBEUI and AppleTalk, it will not disable NetBIOS and the ilk. As a result, it generates more traffic than necessary (every 2 seconds), polluting the network. Finally, the decent web-driven configuration interface that Linksys is known for has been replaced with something quickly thrown together, so that while you can set a password to protect the unit, anyone on the LAN can modify the settings.This unit is a sub-par product, at best. Disappointing, because I'm used to better devices from Linksys."
4,Good Value/Easy Installation,"Overall the PPSX1 was a breeze to set up. It took about 10 minutes it up on a NT4 three-machine home network. No problems after the first day.However, the product photo displayed here on 2/10/00 is wrong. The PPSX1 model that arrived had the parallel port on the back and the 10BaseT and power connections in the front making it impossible to stack or put on a desktop... a silly design... I decided to hide it under a desk. But for 80 bucks it's a good deal."
4,It was up and running in 15 minutes,My client's print server on his copier died. Parallel port was the only option so I picked up the PPSX1. I had it installed in 15 minutes including testing three PC's. It printed fast and they were happy. I used the existing LPR setup that the dead print server was using and everything went smoothly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the admin install gave an error on a DLL which I ignored. It worked however and I was able to set the IP address. The only other complaint was I wasn't able to spend more time there for billing purposes. :-)
1,I don't think this box is what it was cracked up to be,"I wanted to share my Canon Inkjet printer with both my home computers. The manual was quite unhelpful and very poorly organized. According to their website the dip switch settings in the manual are exactly backwards. I bought this box because it says that it supports bi-directional printing but on page 88 (of 91) of the manual, it tells me, ""For best results turn off the printer's bi-directional function..."" I interpret this as saying that it works with bi-directional printers if they aren't working bi-directionally. I'll call their support line first but I think this item is going back where I bought it."
2,Too plain,"Hmmm I am not so sure this is a good buy. Half the book looks like man pages .. not good at all. I have had some use for the book, but I expected more. Keep looking for a book unless you're desperate."
5,Great purchase!,"I'm gonna start by saying that my daughter forgot her bunny on a restaurant and wen i call to ask for it they said that they could not find it,and she was really upset she was crying every day,so i went to every store and i wasn't able to find one that looks like her's!And after a couple of days i found this one and it looks very similar to the one that she lost so i ordered it on a Sunday night and by Friday it was already here wen i got home around 1 pm. And my daughter love it from the very beginning it really save my life LOL because it was hard for me to see my baby so upset but by now she forgot everything about the other bunny and she is really happy whit her new baby!!The material is great,it feels very soft and fluffy and wen you touch it you can tell that the material is really strong,the color is very pretty and the size was perfect for my 4 year old daughter,but in general is just a great purchase!!"
5,"This is an excellent book, but it's not for beginners.","This collection of essays by prominent natural law philosophers is excellent; however, as a grad student in philosophy, I found this book to be a challenge. It assumes that the reader already has a good foundation in natural law."
4,Have 12 of these.,"I'm an engineer at a post production company. We often have visiting production companies in and out, constantly moving and adding PC's and network printers. There is only one jack in each office, so these little hubs come in handy. So far I have had none fail. The only reason I give it four stars is, as the manual states, when you use the uplink port the adjacent port can't be used as they are interconnected. This usually catches people who just come and plug in and then wonder why they can't get on. Other than that, no complaints. A great hub for the money."
5,Linksys Workgroup Hub delivers.,I used the linksys to connect a TiVo to an otherwise completely Mac wireless network consisting of Airport Extreme and several Airport Express Units. Fit in flawlessly. Absolutely no problems.
3,"Good, but ac adapter blew up","I loved it while it worked. but after about 2 months the ac adapter blew up internally. I loved it completely while it worked, but you cannot find a 5 volt ac adapter anywhere! I guess that I will have to ask for one by the manufacterer."
1,"One of the 5 ports went dead, caused serious downtime","During a server room reorganization I added some new servers and plugged in our DSL router into a previously unused port. The port was half-dead in a weird, difficult to diagnose way. Machines in the IT area could still ping the DSL router and get Internet access, but everybody else's Internet and email went down for several hours - nobody could figure out what was wrong. Problem solved when the DSL router was plugged in to a different port again. We're getting rid of this hub fast."
2,Two of my Linksys hubs are dead,"I bought this one 1.5 year ago and it died after a year of use at home. I thought it's just one of few defected product bought by an unlucky guy. Plus, it is definatly not a complex product that will break easily, so I bought another one for the office 6 months ago. Well it died today with the same sympton - the light indicator can't even tell you which port is in use or not (you plug in to the 1st port but the fifth light will be on instead of the 1st one). Did the same thing happen to anyone?"
2,go buy a switch instead,"the speed is too slow, even over a 100mb network, due to its broadcast nature. with switch price so low, buy a switch instead of this one.size: 5speed: 2feature: 2easy of use: 3"
1,"This is a switch, not a hub!","When is a hub not a hub? When Linksys calls it a ""hub""! In spite of its moniker, this device behaves exactly like a switch--namely, traffic is only moved between ports to whom traffic belongs (and not copied to all ports, as it would be on a hub). While this is good behavior for a switch, if you're looking for a hub (for instance, to monitor traffic on a SOHO network), this device will not meet your needs."
1,36 hours,"Finally, at yesterdays birthday we played the DVD ""36 Hours"" and to my great disappointment we found that you have sent us the black & white movie version instead of the coloured one. The advertised lable shows a colour picture of the 2 main actors with colour background, so why did you send a black & white version of this fine movie?Please forward the colour version of ""36 hours"" to me at the same address without any further charges.I have been a good customer of your company for some time now and hope that you will rectify this matter as gesture of good will, most urgently.In anticipation and with best regardsThomas Hillardt"
3,An Interesting But Not Great James Garner Vehicle,This is a film with an interesting premise that unfortunately runs out of steam midway through. Garner fans should probably see it at some point. May be hard to find as it's apparently not out yet on DVD.
4,A great idea.,The thing about this movie is that it comes up with an idea that is unique but completely implausible. But it is still a wonderful movie. The movie takes place just 36 hours prior to the Normandy invasion. Rod Taylor is a nazi doctor who comes up with a plan to kidnap James Garner and convince him that the war is long over and that he has been a victim of amnesia so he can get Garner to tell when and where the invasion is going to occur. And it works.
5,36 Hours and 96 Tears,"A good film is suppose to make you think. This film makes you think and gets style points for being clever. However, NO MILITARY OFFICIAL in is right mind during WWII would send someone on a mission who knows the plan for the D-DAY invasion. NO how No way, would NEVER happen. That said, the acting in the film is good and Rod ""the time machine"" taylor is very competent in his role as the Nazi doctor. Entertaining and worth watching for fun."
4,X-Lent Drama,"A nice little drama with the ""What if"" story. What if a key member of planning D-Day was snatched? Almost feels like it could have happened. Hard to believe plot twists mixed with plausable ones make for a fun and enjoyable movie."
3,The music score works!,"This is a gripping WWII thriller featuring one of Dimitri Tiomkin's best music scores. (When Tiomkin was bad, he was very bad, and when he was good, he was spellbinding.) It's not a perfect movie, and the DVD is such a bare-bones product it doesn't even have scene selections, but this is one of those movies I have to watch straight through every time I see it. I have to cringe at some dialogue lines that sound too flippant, but I do believe that's a script problem, not the actors' fault. James Garner and Rod Taylor are very appealing as enemies who have to admire each other despite their conflict, and Eva Marie Saint's character is believably stricken with spiritual malaise. The situation these three characters are caught in borders on fantasy, but on the whole is realistically portrayed, and the score gives me a most enjoyable ride through repeat viewings."
4,excellent,"Absolutely a must buy for any researcher or master's student! having purchased the software, it has made my work tremendously lighter as i do not have to worry about in-text citation and subsequent bibliography! I truly will recommend this to any scholar out there!"
3,You get what you pay for.,Inexpensive but not very soft. Good for those on cheap budget. My niece loved it anyway. Little sea horse babies do not come out of touch.
4,cuter online?,"I thought this little guy was just adorable, and had to have him. When the box arrived I couldn't wait to see it in person. I think he's cuter online....strangely enough.I am however keeping him. Hes very cute, just not as cute as I was hoping for."
4,Network In a Box,"After spending several weeks doing my home work I choose Linksys FESWSK5 switched 10/100. I am connecting two computers one with pentium 233 and the 2nd with an Amd k6/450 3d processor. Knowing a litte about computers and how to find the drivers on a cd or a floopy helps.I did not have any trouble with setting up either computer. the AMD computer also has a high speed network card in it as well, I thought that I might have trouble with the cable modem and network card but I did not.I would recommend that you spend the time to do your home work, on the type of network you want, and spend a little extra money for the network switched 10/100 instead of the network hub. I think that even A first time user could get their network up and running if they brought this network in a box."
1,I Couldn't Get it to Work,"I couldn't get it to work with my Windows ME computer, although it installed just fine on my Windows 98 computer. There was no mention of Windows ME on their web site or with their drivers, so I suspect there's an interface issue they haven't sorted out. I was not pleased with their support -- noone answered their help line and 6 e-mails to their designated e-mail address went unanswered.Whereas I'm unhappy with Linksys, Amazon gets 5 stars because they couldn't have been more helpful and timely with the return."
3,M.E.? M.E.? M.E.?,"I want this product so bad I can taste it.Problem is, it appears that it is useless to use it with windows ME. Customers, no matter where they go, seem to have no choice but to assume that if the requirements say the product works with 98, then it will work with ME. The reason is that hardly anyone bothers to mention ME, whether it is compatible with their product or not.ME may not be the most reliable OS but MANY MANY people have it.The situation is ridiculous."
3,Wouldn't buy again,"I bought this thinking it was the die cast cars, but to my dismay they are cheap plastic cars. I think they would be great for cake toppers but not for toys. At least not for my son who just turned 3 and is used to playing with the die cast."
2,Cars,These are really cheap. Definitely not what I was expecting. I was expecting a durable metal car and received it to find out it was light weight and cheap plastic. Cars did not last long at all.
3,A Little Too Sweet,"One reviewer called this book ""gut-wrenching""; only if this is the very first book you have read on WWII. I found it overly sweet, overtly Christian and very predictable. All the characters are ""salt of the earth"" types. It seems nearly everyone is a Christian, even the main character who has a tough time yielding to God went to a Christian college and wrote one of the best Christian books of all time. Racism is brought in, but that is even sugar coated. There is no grit, no grime, none of the horror and terror of war. The characters talk about their fear, but there is nothing in the narative that makes you feel it. This book is really written for middle-schoolers. It's a love story staged in WWII England."
3,Diabetic warning: pretty syrupy,"My dad was a bomber pilot in WWII, and I enjoy fiction set in this era. I enjoyed some aspects of this book; there were several little asides that evoked the time period very well. It is a very warm story, and there's nothing in it I wouldn't want my mother to read.BUT, it's a little too sweetly corny and predictable to get more than three stars. The ending, in particular, was telegraphed from the very start, so there was no surprise when it arrived.There's also a very strong Christian-faith-promoting undercurrent, which didn't bother me, but it gets in the way of the plot. In fact, it is the plot, pretty much. So this book would be a popular addition to the library shelves at the local Bible college, but I can't say it rates very high on my list of recommended reads. Sorry."
3,Battery Tender Plus,"The product itself appears to be functioning properly. I've used Battery Tenders in the past and have always been pleased with them. One drawback, an extension cord to go between the Battery Tender and the car battery is not available. They make one for several of their other models, but not for the Battery Tender Plus. Packaging was a little shoddy; there was no padding in the box whatsoever. Fortunately, there seems to be no damage to the unit."
5,Battery Tender,"Ordered this to keep battery charged at full on my grandfather's 1950 Ford Tudor, as we don't drive it frequently. It works well, and I like the way I can leave it hooked up to the battery without worry of overcharge. The 6V version is particularly useful, as most battery chargers lack this feaure nowadays."
2,It works but it will boil your battery,Don't just leave it conected to the battery for a long time. It will boil the battery. Used on a car battery last year and had to replace the battery in the spring because the charger had boiled the battery and killed 1 of the cells. Works great. I have the 12 volt to for the lawn mower and other things. But remember not to just leave it connected and come back in 5 months. You'll need a battery.

3,"Interesting stories, but some are too similar","Bought this book for a high school World History class in 9th grade and it had some truly intriguing, while also horrifying stories. It was oftentimes enthralling to read (the most interesting History book I've ever read!) and also incredibly eye-opening. I recommend this to teachers/schools looking for engaging course material. It was worth every penny.However, some of the stories in the beginning of the book seemed to reiterate a point over and over again. They were all interesting, but were they all necessary? Maybe some further organization by the editors could've been used, but overall very good textbook."
3,Serves My Purposes,"I bought this old version of PowerDirector for one reason only: It would read/convert by digital camcorders .MOD files. I had received the Express version with the camera, but upon switching computers, could not find the disks. I was not going to pay a lot because I use another program to do all my editing anyway. I was able to get this version cheap, and for what I want it to do, it does well, however, look elsewhere if you are looking for indepth precision or professional quality."
1,Don't bother buy it or use it,I picked it up from a flea market thinkin' it would be better than Pinnacle Studio because it's a big program. I installed it in my computer and went through it and nothing about inserting disc chapter points were there. This program was a waste of money.
5,Great listening,"This is a great CD! I have played it constantly since getting it. These duets are very tight - there is a natural and well-balanced relationship between the instruments, and the writing is very good. I have an extensive collection of acoustic instrumental music, and this one fits right in with the best that Windham Hill and Narada have to offer."
5,OMG It works!!!!!!!!!!,"Ladies, this pill is a miracle pill. I don't want to sound like I'm getting paid to write a good review or anything but IT WORKS!!!!! I've been taking it for over a week now and my hormones are balanced, no more vaginal infections out of nowhere, no PMS, no menstrual cramps...I recommend it to everyone i know."
5,Dylan album Desire,I bought this album for my daughter Nicki and she tells me ( she lives in Maui) that it is great and she loves it. What more can I say?
3,Seven songs for the price of eight!,"Aside from Mozambique, this is a very good album ( I give it three stars -- most users over-rate music; five stars should be reserved for nothing less than the White Album or Astral Weeks.) But, oh my god, Mozambique is terrible. Buy the album on iTunes so that you can immediately delete one of the worst decisions of Dylan's career. Mozambique makes Jokerman sound like Mozart."
4,Desire,Beautiful ballads by a master of poetry. I also have this on vynal and cassette. Love to have things in all format.
3,had most if not all songs already,disappointed in re-mastering. took a bunch of good songs and homogenized them. stick with the originals. you probably have them already.
4,Dylan Returned,"After Blood on the Tracks, Dylan followed it up with Desire and his return from musical obscurity was complete with the album that spawned the Rolling Thunder Revue. Most of the reviewers take Joey with a certain amount of surprise, but not me. I think Joey is Dylan as satirist, after all, how many bad guys have ended up as folk heroes, and why can't Crazy Joe be included in with this crowd? Sara has to be Dylan at his most depressing best with a plaintive, agonizing love song to his wife as the marriage is breaking up. While I suspect that the Dylan purists will cringe, with Blood on the Tracks, Desire, and Hard Rain you have the essential Bob Dylan of the 70's with music that has withstood the test of time just as strongly as the music of Bob Dylan the 60's folkie. I'll take him both ways without regret."
1,Dylan's Most Overrated Album,"I just don't get why people like this album. It stinks. ""Sara"" is Dylan at his whiny worst. ""Mozambique"" was the result of a drunken bet about how many words Dylan could rhyme with Mozambique. And the worst thing of all on the album is Rivera's screeching violin on every track. About her: Dylan was riding in a limo and saw her walking on the street with a violin case. He liked the way she walked so he picked her up and promised to allow her to play on his album. And so it goes. ""Bringin' it all Back Home"" this ain't.I am a huge Dylan fan and have most of is catalogue, but this is the one album of his that I just can't stand. Not one song works.If you are new to Dylan , get ""Bringin it all Back Home"", ""Highway 61"", ""Blonde on Blonde"", and ""Blood on the Tracks"". If you already have those, there are about 20 more to get before you bother with this one.Oh, and one more thing: Reuben Carter was guilty."
5,Great old classics by the best entertainer...,"You can't do better than Burl Ives for these old classic tunes we all love, bought this to share with my grandkids."
3,Too Much Hype -- Not Enough Objectivity,"I'm totally baffled by the amount of rave reviews this game is getting: people, this game just isn't that great! I'm typically not a cynical person, but I have to think that some of these sychophantic reviewers are really shills of the developer. Here are some pros and cons:PROS:- nice graphics and production design- good voice acting- interesting storylineCONS:- extremely linear gameplay (only one way to complete each scene)- interminable load times between scenes- small game space (although it looks huge, where you can go in the HL2 world is very limited)- limited objects to interact with (how many cardboard boxes can you throw around and still have fun?)- idiotic AI (both enemy combatants and friendly squad)- don't get me started about the Valve crap- TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE ENDING!!!Try playing Far Cry for a really immersive experience."
1,Deserves 0 stars for stupidity,"Start installing at 9PM, finish at 2AM. That's 5 hours, on an ADSL connection, in January 2005 (ie well after the initial rush). Game suffered from choppy sound, partially fixed by patch. The Steam concept is utterly stupid. If I will complete the game in, say, 20 hours, why should I spend 5 hours loading it? No instructions to explain what is going on - just a single card with default keyboard options. Don't buy this game - to punish them for this stupidity. BTW I loved Half Life. This game is pretty good, but not enough of an advance over other stuff out there to really wow me."
5,Doom 3 and Half-Life 2,"Doom 3 and Half-life 2 are not comparible because they are two totally different games. First of all, doom 3 is meant to be fun and intense, not have the deepest storyline. Just look at doom 1 and 2, did they really look story focused? Doom 3 is a single player focused Blast The Living Sh** out of Demons From Hell kind of game.Half-Life 2 is a story/action based shooter where the real pull is the multiplayer. Half-life is the slower paced of the two but also had a better story, Doom was fast paced and had great action but almost no story. SO END THE ARGUEMENTS!!!"
1,the game that hasn't,"How can anyone actually write a review for this game. No one has played it. The only thing you can comment on is what the media has said about it. Anyone can look at a screenshot and guess that the graphics will be awesome.Sure there's a lot of hype about this game and sure it MIGHT blow everyone's socks off. But, shouldn't you at least wait for it to come out before you say how great it is. That is...if they ever release it."
2,Half-Life 2 now over a year old,"Half Life 2 may be okay for a game that's over a year old. But the problem is that the general public has never played it. It's aging FAST. When (or if) it finally comes out, it will be rather dated and unimpressive.The other problem is that the enthusiasm for this game peaked about eight months ago and has been in decline ever since. Timing is very important in game releasing and I think HL2 missed the mark by a long shotI hope it will come out, and I probably will purchase it. If so, I will revise my review accordingly. As for now, it is turning out to be one of the biggest disappointments in recent PC game history.Not September 15Now November 1, 2004We shall see. Maybe for Christmas THIS year."
1,IS THE WAIT WORTH IT?,"With Valve's evil marketing scheme, Gabe's direct lies to the press, and the ever so hyped ""Preload"", will this game live up to the intense hype? This game will need to out do every game that has come out since the original release date in order to be even worth the wait. I preordered HL2 in June and now we see again the date is pushed back. What am I supposed to do now, Gabe? Buy CS: Condition Zero? I think not. You see the only reason that this game has been held back repeatedly is because the Counter Strike: Condition Zero sales were no where near the amount Gabe and Valve would like them to be. My theory is that when enough CS:CZ's are sold HL2 will be released. So now we wait until most likely January or February 2005 for the release. Did Gabe go over and take release lessons from 3D Realms? In closing, though I love the first game and await the next, I hope Gabe loses money on this release."
1,HURRY UP SIERRA!,"I'm getting tired of the promises. Sierra has pushed back the date SOOOOO many times that it is getting rediculous. A while ago I was really looking forward to this game, but now all I feel is irritation with Sierra... MY GOD MAN, GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER AND RELEASE THE GAME ALREADY!!!!"
1,Getting STEAMed up!,"Do NOT under any circumstances buy this game for any reason whatsoever. It will not run on your system, or any system at all for that matter. The steam engine, which is what runs all of Valve's games at this point in time, does not work. If you check the Steam support website, you will find that basically every tech savvy gamer out there is getting the error ""missing file: Steam.dll"". Hundreds of people are complaining about this and have been for over a month. If you get an older version of the game, the steam engine will auto-update itself to the newest (i.e. non-working) version. There is no fix. There is no workaround. Valve has been promising a patch to fix this for a long time now, but no patch has been forthcoming. My advice: buy Doom 3 instead. At least it works."
1,painfully disappointed,"I have never had such a painful installation. The year old software that comes in the package is obscenly out of date and requires hours of on-line updating. The STEAM support forum is virtually useless, so unless you are a boy-junior-geek-squad-techno junkie, think twice before you blow your dough on this alegedly superb game of the year."
1,"great game, nasty smell coming from somewhere though...",Games looks great and plays great really fun and involving but it carries an unfortunate taint... the steam installer software. Christ is that annoying. I never want to see another game using that again. I'm certainly going to be checking before I buy any more pc games to make sure they don't come with that steam garbage.
3,Waste of a Great Engine,"Great graphics, excellent NPC animation, smooth gameplay. Beyond this, you will simply have the (completely linear) opportunity to kill hundreds of enemy soldiers, zombies, and ""head crabs"", solve a few simple puzzles, and drive an air boat and a dune buggy without ever knowing exactly why you are doing any of it. In the end you will realize that Super Mario Brothers was more fun, and had a better story."
1,Don't buy it USED!,"If you buy this used you will have to send the CD and all packaging INTACT back to Valve for replacement due to CD key being registered to only one user. It will cost $10.00 and take 6 to 8 weeks.The instructions at Valve say that if you buy it used then ALL the packaging has to be sent back. How often do you receive all the original packaging when you buy something?I just bought a used copy, and found that Valve's registration system was a ripoff. rather than dump this game on another unsuspecting idiot I have thrown it away."
1,frustration!!!!!!,IVE BEEN READING OTHER REVIEWS AND I FEEL THE SAME WAY I WAITED SO LONG FOR THE GAME SO FINNEALY IT COMES OUT AND I PAY THE 54 DOLLAR PRICE WICH IS A JOKE IN MY BOOK BUT ANYWAY I GET IT HOME AND THERES 5 DISCS UM I THOUGHT VALVE HAD HEARD ABOUT DVD TECHNOLOGY WELL I GUESS NOT NO MATTER AFTER INSTALLING THE BEAST I HAD BEEN SITTING THERE SO LONG A NEEDED A CIGG THEN I COME BACK HOPING ALL THIS WAS WORTH IT AS I CLICK THE ICON TO BEGGIN PLAYING IT THEN INFORMS ME I MUST HAVE A INTERNET CONNECTION WICH AT THIS TIME I DONT HAVE IM SURE AT THIS POINT YOU CAN IMAGIN MY FRUSTRATION I WAS SO MAD I WANTED TO TAKE THE GAME THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW ANYWAY DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS I DID IT MAY BE AN IMPRESSIVE GAME BUT EVEN AFTER BUYING IT I DONT KNO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR FIND A DIFFERENT GAME THERES PLENTY OUT THERE I RECCOMEND MOA PACIFIC
4,"Awesome, but don't buy used","I highly recommend the game, but it when you register it it's locked to a single user account on Steam. So if you buy it used, you won't be able to register, and can't play!"
3,It is too complicated,"Half Life 2 is a excellent game with graphics, physics, and a ok story from the first one. The reason i gave it 3 stars is because set up is bad. You have to join ""STEAM""(online provider for Sierra games) to play Half Life 2 online or offline. Then the game takes up 4.5-9GB! This is not a great game to get on old machines. If you have all the recent computer tech from the Hard Drive to the Graphics chip and don't mind having personal informatinon leaked then get the game."
1,Activation takes SO DAMN LONG!,"I waited and waited and waited and waited for the game to be on the store shelves. Finally no more delays and I got my over fifty dollar version. Okay. It's gonna be a great game . That's what I have read it was and after so many delays it had to be considering its predecessors. Five disks to install. kind of like shades of XIII.Don't get a nice thick jewel case however. Got it all installed and then I had to activate it. I can see their reason why. No problem I thought to myself. I said that and after an hour activating and decrypting files I'm still not ready to play the game.Think I'll just take it out and put a nice easy to install ,no fuss,no mess game in and put my long waited for and beautiful copy of HL2 in a closet where I can't see how much money I wasted."
1,"Buy CD, must download and internet, Steam has me Steamed","It is ironic that a game of this theme makes you sign up on their internet site and download large amounts of files even if you buy the cd from the store. I refuse to participate in that. I made the mistake of going along with that in Half-Life 1, but not again in Half-Life 2.This thing, this albatross to a potentially enjoyable experience is called Steam."
2,half-life & half-life 2,The actual game is fairly good. The reason I give it low marks is because I had to download data that should have been provided with the game. I feel I should be able to play a game without having to download updates. Downloading updates should be optional. If your download speed is only 56 k then be prepared to have your computer download for several hours prior to playing.
4,Great game if you forgive Steam and the 1.5 years of delays,"The game has a high fun-factor, however steam has some problems. However, it is a legal way to download new games.The game is the best FPS I have ever played, the constant action is great. The story leaves something to be desired, but the gravity gun is the best gun ever in a game. You need no ammo and still can do some major damage if used right.The other major problems with the game is if you try playing for a few minutes and few hours will go by and HL: Source is the same as the 1998 version except with the awesome water (best water ever in a game)."
1,Not sure yet,"I hope to enjoy the game..I got it yesterday from eb games and YES I noticed the online connectin required. HOWEVER, MOST WILL ASSUME THIS IS FOR REGISTRATION ONLY Its not an online game(primarily) . Until you actually open the box you dont realize that you are required to have one to even play. I DONT agree with that AT ALL. They will still get their money, this is the sort of thing thats driving pc gamers to console, and making these companies spend more on consoles than pc games (much to the chagrin of pc gamers). While the game itself may be worth it, (looking forward to it) this BS with ""steam"" is definitely NOT"
1,Returned without a hitch,"I just returned HL2. The internet authentication hassle and long term concerns were definitely not worth the $$$$ I spent on the retail collectors edition. This edition was extremely disappointing for the extra money required. I will likely purchase HL2 again at a more reasonable price once Valve has had a chance to correct some useability issues. At least they won't be getting as much of my money for this fiasco.I returned HL2 since the game did not work as advertised. There is no mention of a product called STEAM being installed on the box or that an internet connection is required whenever I want to run HL2 (Sorry, OFFLINE mode absolutely does not work when configured as specified).Very disappointing, but I am hoping some corrections will come out soon and then I will try to install and play HL2 again."
1,Might be 5 Stars if it worked.,I would have given this game a zero if I could. I could not install the game. I spent hours online reading work arounds for various errors but not for error 1305 which I had. I tried to unzip the file from the disc and the file was corrupted. I got the game on 12/25 and e-mailed VU games the same day for help. Three days later I got an e-mail back telling me to try all the things I had already done. I replied that it still didn't work. I never heard from them again. After two weeks of owning this game I returned it without ever being able to install it. I will never buy a VU game again.
3,The game is fantastic! The Security is the worst!,"The game itself if fantastic! The AI is brilliant, the puzzles are challenging yet not impossible and the real life physics are just fun to watch (People falling head over heals off a cliff is just plain fun!)What irks me is the security. When I heard you had to connect to steam to get it working I thought it would be like the adobe CS programs, just log on and get authorized and thats it. NOT HALF LIFE 2! They install this highly intrusive steam program that takes a good chucnk of resources. Also, you just don't verify the game once and that's it, every once in a while it has to reauthorize (because I bought the game and then decided to steal it later????) It sometimes takes an hour to load the game up because of this reauthorization.Game is great but Valve and Sierra went WAY over the top with security. I will NEVER buy another product that uses the steam system, it's just not worth it"
3,"Great game, but I will never buy a valve game again","The game is fantastic, if you can manage to playfor some reason valve software has decided to use steam, an internet game network, to validate the game, even the single player one.you can read all about how good the game is (it really is) in the other reviews.but be aware that1) installation takes forever2) counter strike source reports ""game unavailabe"" most of the time3) You need to be online to play, wont be taking this game on any trips.4) The steam engine is as I write this in frustration ""verifing my flies"" again, for the last 20 minutes!! before allowing me to play. I've only had the game for three days!"
3,review,"Game play and graphics are enjoyable even with all the new gen games coming out, this one still stand on its own. One of the few fps games that have a decent story line that enrich the game play.The downside...it comes with a program called Steam which helps with support, download and purchasing of mods. Doesn't sounds too bad unless it doesn't work. If steam can't verify your code you can't play...support is almost non-existant. If you have dual processors it gives half-life 2 some trouble."
1,This game forces constant internet connectivity,"This game forces constant internet connectivity, even when playing solo. You are at the mercy of the companies servers even when playing locally."
1,STEAMED UP!!!,"I know that this game is magnificent but I agree with one of the reviewers. ""Steam"" keeps popping up and kept telling me that my game was pre-installed and not ready to be played offline. I don't know what to do anymore because my sister bought it for me and mailed it to me abroad. There goes my refund."
3,Fun but SLOW,"I purchased this game for my dad. I never expected to be playing it myself! The graphics are really good, and the gameplay is not TOO difficult. The game is pretty linear though, but it doesn't take away from the fun of shooting zombies. And that is really what the game is about anyway. As for the story line, it's pretty cheesy but I wasn't expecting much.One HUGE problem with this game is the loading time. About every fifteen minutes during the game, it has to load something which can take up to 3 minutes. It seems like you are waiting for things to load more than you are playing."
1,NICE GAME BAD INSTALLER,"STEAM IS A PAIN IN THE NECK, I HATE THE INSTALLER, AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A SUPERFAST INTERNET CONNECTION YOU WILL BE INSTALLING FOR 24 HOURS DUE TO STAEM AND THE DECRYPTION AND THE REGISTRATION AS WELL AS THE UPDATES. VERY ANNOYING. GREAT GAME PLAY!"
1,why should i have to be online to play this game?,"i paid $50 for this game, no where in the hype did it say i had to hook up to an internet connection just to load it in my computer. i have a high end gaming computer with 1GB ram, 3.2GB CPU, 256 DDR ATI Radeon 9800 XT graphics card. i don't hook this to the internet because i don't want to contaminate it with bullsh*t, and i don't intend to. i'm returning Half-Lame2, f*ck those guys. i think far cry blows it away."
1,Steam? What a joke,"Though i am sure this is a good game i may never know thanks to this aweful little devil called STEAM! this program is clearly a violation of privacy as it hijacks your Pc in the attemps to keep the game from being pirated. In doing so it alienates all of the good people out there just wanting to play the game of the year. It is such a buggy program that all of a sudden i cannot even put in a half life Cd without my Pc freezing up requiring a restart. I will never purchase any product containing STEAM and anyone who does is asking for trouble. I warned ya!! thank me later!!! Thanks STEAM/VALVE,,i will spend my money on products not associated with you."
4,Half Life2 - more questions when you finish the game,"luved HL1, couldn't wait for HL2. The installation took a really long time, but the it was worth it. The game is a lot of fun, the graphics are breathtaking.Unfortunately the plot is lacking. There are many questions left unanswered, and you finish the game more confused than when you started.Probably the easiest game i've ever played in ""normal"" diffuculty mode...."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME USED!!!!,"As the title suggests, do not buy this game used! In order to play it, you will need a CD key that is unused. A great improbablity if you buy this used! I made this mistake and now I have five minature frizbees or coasters for drinks.Buy Half-Life 2 new only!"
1,highly overrated...,"This game is the most overrated game i've ever seen.With NO storyline, half-life2 is getting 3^1/2 stars. that is impossible. games like this one should get 2 or less stars. Almost no effort was put in this game. I wasted my money for this game, and i'm buying an actually GOOD game now, called doom 3.This is only my opinion, but i recommend you to spend money for something more worthy your time than THIS.Not satisfied at all"
1,frustrated customer,"I have just wasted an entire day trying to get this game to run. I curse those who came up with the steam concept. I did finally get past the steam nightmare, but this game crashes my relatively new computer."
1,The Steam idea is terrible.,"I overlooked the one review that rated this game as a one Star game, and paid the price. I have never been as frustrated as I was while trying to install this game, but this one took the cake. The experiance with Steam is absolutly terrible. This is the worst way to sell a game. Forcing a person to wait 2 hours to play a game, one that costs a lot of dough, is a sin. I will never own another Valve game ever. I have played hundreds of games and been pleased with most results, I am not hard to please and am very patient, but after almost two hours of trying to play Half-life 2, I gave up, took the game off my computer and sent it back. All in the same day of receiving it!!! Never again."
1,Steam should be banned,My copy failed to register the first time I tried it (server crash) and then refused to register after that because it said I'd already registered. Their customer support is non existent (couple of email addresses nobody ever replies to) so I've not actually been able to play it. Would rate it 0 stars if that were possible. Copy protection that prevents people who've bought a game from playing it should illegal!
1,Very disapointed,"I've waited a long time for this game and picked it up yesterday. The game took 30 minutes to install, which is fine. But then this stream server wants to connect to it's web site and I spent another hour over a 56k connection unlocking my half life 2 files. Even after all this I could still not play the game. When I clicked on the play game button I was told it would take another 19 minutes till I could start to play. The doc said about clicking remember my password to play offline, which I never saw. I don't like spending $55 for a game to be made to feel like a criminal. I never even played this game, since it would not let me. I'll be taking the game back for a full refund. I will not support these kind of games. This may be a great game with great graphics, but I was never able to find out."
1,Valve has taken a turn for the worse,"I was a huge fan of the original Half-Life when it was first released. When I heard that a sequel was going to be made, I was so exited that I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I bought the game only to find out that and internet connection is required to play even single player. GUESS WHAT VALVE?! NOT EVERYONE HAS AN INTERNET CONNECTION! My home computer (which is the computer that I play games on) doesn't have an internet connection.HL2 sucks. Steam sucks. Valve sucks. THE END."
1,Great game ruined by Steam interference,"The game is top notch--no complaints there. My gripe is dealing with Steam. Yeah it took a long time to download (several hours) and register with Steam. All was fine for many months until I foolishly let Steam update it's files while I tried to start the game while still connected to the Internet (I just do single player, no multi for me). The Steam update (which I suspect I didn't have to have) totally screwed up my game. It won't let me play now. I can't access the game at all. I've tried a myriad a way to figure out this puzzle. Be cautious of this game unless you are a total geekmeister. I do OK, but I'm no geekmeister. After numerous emails and FAQ searches with Steam, I gave up and haven't played since my ability to do so was STOLEN by Steam--which really means a Steaming pile of poo!"
1,Do not buy this game !,"Do not buy this game ! You have to register online with Steam before playing this game. Unless this game was never played, it is registered to someone else and you will never be able to play it. I found this out the hard way, as I bought this for my son for Christmas. This was the present he wanted the most. What a disappointment! Steam / Valve will give you NO support in this matter. So if you must have this game, buy it brand new in an unopened box !"
3,Taste,"Half life copied doom 1's story by opening a portal, and now half life 2 copies doom 2's story by returning to earth. Go figure why I'm readin the opposite at the review for doom3???"
4,Gonna blow your mind,"I was never a big fan of the past half-life but played it to pass the time. The new Half-life 2 is amazing. From what I've seen in previews and sneek peeks, it's finally passing up the other games with DOOM III as it's only real competition for now. It's being advertised with a release date of Dec, but I've read it will be released as early as Sept, 03. The scale of this game is amazing too. Huge creatures, excellent 3D environments, etc etc etc. Lets hope it's clipping and gameplay match the visuals and hype."
5,A Healthy Alternative,"Everyone that is waiting for this game does not have to wait any longer. Why is that you ask?Half-Life 2, being the end-all-be-all of PC gaming as we know it has been bested. The game I speak of is already out. Graphically it does everything that Half-Life 2 claims to do, and it's single player mode is long, interesting, and a fair challenge. This game can be exactly what everyone needs: something to hold tight to until the big HL2 arrives. For myself, I don't really mind if they delay HL2 again. This game I speak of has pacified me indefinitely.The game, is FAR CRY!!!!!!!!If you haven't yet tried it, and are looking for HL2... Get this game! If anything, play the demo and be surprised that a small development studio can do HL2 quality, and be OUT ON TIME! Valve really has some work cut out for them to best FAR CRY, and they have had so much time to do it already.FAR CRY. Do it up, people. You won't be disapointed."
4,Is it a Movie or is it a Game?,I must start out by saying wow this game is amazing. The graphics and physics are amazing and make me feel like I AM Gordan Freeman. I couldn't believe my eyes the first time I encountered the Helicopter and all the wood crates around me turned to splinters. This game is a work of art. But with every work of art there is Criticism. The game stability is not up to par. It started out bug free and went that way till about level 4. Around there the game started freezing and would even restart my computer. Maybe its my computer I dont know but it really bugs me when im in the middle of making human history and my start up screen pops up. well here are my specs if you want to run the game on high you must need a better computer than this.2.8 Ghz P4 HT1 GB PC3200 DDR180 GB 7200 RPM HD128 MB G Force FX 5950 Ultra
3,"Great game, but too EASY!","After waiting for a long time, years in fact the game finally arrived. Filled with excitement I proceeded to load the game, only to find an annoyance called Steam. After spending almost three hours uploading, downloading and generally asking why am I bothering with this at all, I remembered this is Half-Life 2.When I finally got the game to run, it was jaw dropping. The realism was amazing and the characters better still.Unfortunately I finished the game in four days ( or 20 hours )- Yes too EASY!! The last two levels took 20 mins to finish - They should be the most difficult!The original Half-Life was harder. Great game, but too easy."
5,Loved it all the way through.,"I seriously can't think of anything wrong with the game. It ran fairly well on my radeon 9600. I counldn't turn the graphics all the way up of course but it still looked so much better than other games I have. The level design is just absolutly amazing, and the game never gets repititve. All the greatest and most shocking moments are spread evenly throughout the game."
5,WOW!,"Okay, after all the trouble it was to download and get started, it was still more than well worth it. This beats the original hands down. It was a visual feast with many, many surprises. The gravity gun was just amazing (especially towards the end when it had more power). The interaction with almost all objects as well as the physics engine makes this, in my opinion, one of the best first person shooters ever made.Dang, this was some fun.Highly recommended."
1,Do Not Buy This Game Used,"ATTENTION: This is a poor choice for any gamer that wants to buy a used game. The product key is attached to the buyer's Steam account, instead of the boxed game. The only way that a used game will work is if the original buyer never installed and played the game."
1,Returned Item,"I never have had such a hard time with a game before. The online game system, somehow managed to change the settings that I set for it to not automatically update. Each time it tried an automatic update it failed around 88%. This of course caused me to lose my progress in the game each time. It would not have been bad if it happened only once. However, it happened four (4!!) times. This was compounded by the fact that no one ever contacted me to help. I sent messages and problem reports. I asked them for help every way possible. I even scoured message boards and followed their advice. I really liked the game, and it was disappointing to me that I could not get the problems worked out. I am not sure about this method of gaming that forces you to login to the internet each time. It really causes a hassle. Half-Life turned out to be 1 of only a few games, that I have ever returned in my 20+ years of gaming."
3,Most annoying install ever!,"Who are they kidding? How much control do they really need? This is by far the most irritating game to install / play ever. Any of the good aspects of this game are ruined by the way they are trying to control how it's played. I wonder how much time and money could have been saved had they not taken this ""must be connected to the internet"" approach."
2,It Makes Me Sad,"I waited sooo long for this game. As we all did. I found it a big let down. The only thing good about it is the facial detail and after about 15 - 20 min's it doesn't matter anymore. The bigest let down is the story or lack of it. There's nothing to it. No additional information about the train you were on, how you got to wherever you are and why you have to go around shooting everything.The thing that made HL great was it's story. Half Life 2 has no story! You run through burned out country sides and city blocks with no orginal enemies.There are too many shoot'em up games out there now. I'm afaid, Half Life 2 can sit on the shelf with the rest of them.Oh, and I finished the game in about 30 hours of play. My wife didn't even get time to get mad at me for my computer game playing.It sure makes me sad."
3,Disappointing so far,"I'm, sure that once I get the BS online registration done it'll be great, I'm giving it 3 stars for potential. I tried to do it at work on our T-1 but their server froze or something and the download locked up and I couldn't complete it. I have no idea why someone at steam or Valve thought this was agood idea. They should be fired.I am annoyed and angry, I just want to play my game, at home in single player mode. There is no reason for having to do this online thing...I guess they have need to load some spyware on my maching first?"
5,Saw the E3 demo... A must get!!!,"This game is going to change the gaming forever!!! A new standard for all FPS! Interaction with all the objects in the game enviroment, with believable and realistic physics, smart-as-hell enemy AIs, and most of all, the graphics! I can't believe it was in a game when I saw the screenshots; I though they were real locations where they used as reference photos to make the game, but then I realized they were in-game screenshots!Bullets leave marks on EVERYTHING! Bump-mapping wall surfaces, Greates shader effects on water ever, and the facial animation of the characters are just too incredible to believe! This game is the relic of all hardcore gamers! Time to upgrade if you haven't got a decent video card! This game is what the hardwares are made for!"
5,BUY THIS GAME,"The engine for this game is landmark. I know a game developer who has inside information on the amount of money spent on this engine. Without really letting it out at this time, let's just say it's an enormous sum of money devoted to a game engine.As the video taken at E3 shows, this game will truly be INCREDIBLE. The original Half-Life took the Quake 2 engine and made a much better single player game than Quake 2 was. Half Life was also the platform for the Counterstrike mod. The other day I went to a site that listed the number of players currently online playing several particular games: Quake 2: ~3000 players, Medal of Honor: ~6000, Quake 3: ~4500, and so on. Counterstrike: ~60,000 people, and it is 5 years old! With THE most advanced engine ever developed and a history of excellent story and single/multiplayer gameplay, this game will be SUPERBLY THE BEST."
1,Nasty,"I haven't got round to playing this game.Install #1: Install got to the 4th CD and gave me a 'fatal error' which meant I had no option but to start the install process again from CD1.Install #2: Install got the end of CD3 and it choked my CD drive; when it asked for the next CD the drive wouldn't open. Reboot...Install #3: Got through the CD's, logged in to Steam (I have an old account from 18 months back when Valve released this control freak with CS 1.6). Unfortunately the login stalled and crashed everything and I was forced to reboot again. I then tried to run HL2 using the provided shortcut and I got a dead response. I looked in Task Manager to find Steam running surreptitiously in the background with a 13MB footprint. I then open TCP/IP view to find an established connection running.So there you have it, this customer has got 2 hours of frustration and a pig on his HDD for his money."
1,$55.00 bucks down the tube,I cant tell you if this game is good or not becauseSTEAM will not let me play it. I hope VALVE boughtsomething nice with my money. I got nothing.
1,A Major Disappointment!!!!,"I am a fan of the Half-Life series, I loved Half-Life 1 and played all the internet versions of this game, so I waited for Half-Life 2 and finally Vivindi universal(A company that is not reputable), and Valve release this ridiculous game with this program called ""Steam"" all I have to say is Try getting this thing to function! That is right! It does not work unless you get an authorization through steam to use it, I can understand wanting to protect the game against piracy, but this is nuts! I sat with this stupid thing for 2 hours and still could not get it to work. I would never buy anything that runs with this steam thing again. I think the real thieves are Valve and Vivindi Universal for stealing my money and making sure I could not play this game, I recommend getting Hitman 1, 2, or 3. and waiting for part 4 because this game is a major disappointment all around!. They lost my Buissness!"
5,Almost time.,"ok guys, brothers at arms. the time has come. as of next tuesday hl2 will be available to play. i cannot wait. this game promises soo much. i jus hope it can live up to its expectaions. really though i think it will surpass anything that has ever been done in the gaming industry. forget doom3. forget far cry. hl2 is going to set the precident for video game technology for years to come. i bought the bronze package on steam and have been playing counter-strike source for about a month. i have to say...cs:s is ok. the graphics and physics are great...but the source engine just doesnt run all that great on an online server. i KNOW this problem will not be a problem while playing the single player hl2. everyday is a countdown for me and i am ticking off the seconds. HELL YEAH!"
1,This game totaly rocks.,"Well I dont know if the game rocks, but a friend of a friends who knows a friend that once met a dude that has a brother that has a friend said it rocks. This is the same guy that said that Doom 5 and Halo 4 are also great games. I dont need to play the game to know its good because the screen shots tell it all. Its just like you can tell if that girl is really hot by the sound of her voice and how her friend looks right?If you cant tell yet this is not a serious post. If you were reading this and agreeing with me then ask the person next to you to slap you as hard as they can.Amazon shouldnt allow people to review a game until the day of release."
1,Just say no,"The box says ""internet connection required"" in very small type at the end of the system requirements label.What they mean is that it will install adware on your system, require a fast connection to install, and (I guess) require a connection every time you want to play even in single player mode. I will never play the game because after I finally finished installation it forced me to create a ""steam"" user account, then it hung while ""decrypting game files"" and said ""Our servers are busy, try back later"". Muddy field, couldn't play.Cast a vote against adware, spyware and the whole ""phone home"" software genre. Avoid this game like a rabid squirrel."
3,Small bang for the wait,"The environment, graphics, usable objects, and animations have greatly improved from Half Life. However, it runs much slower than the first game and I found the interface frustrating.For instance, you can only jump about four inches off the ground. There were times where I spent fifteen to thirty minutes stacking items up against a wall, only to find that I could not jump over it not matter how high the stack.It also took forever to load between levels and between scenes. It seemed I was always waiting for the game to load.In multi-player mode the game ran much slower than the original Half-life or Halo. They nerfed the crossbow and the rocket launcher interface is just plain weird. The gravity gun is cool, but hard to manipulate.The Steam package is good idea and I really liked the improvements to Counter Strike."
4,Awsome game!,"This game is awesome-usually I play realistic games such as Counterstrike. The reason I took a fancy to this game was that it was a massive improvement on the first one: such as the game play, graphics and ease of use. In this game they have introduced come awesome weapons such as the rail gun, which lets out laser beams and many other weapons, which will keep you hooked onto the game 24/7. The reason that I did not give the game 5 stars was because even though it was definitely a massive improvement on the first one but still in my view, it could have been made better if it was a little less futuristic and more realistic, but that is simply a personal view because I prefer realistic games.Conclusion:This game Is one of the best futuristic games I have ever played and should keep the player absorbed and hopefully will improve even more with the updates which will be arriving soon. Also go to www.steampowered.com for more information on this game."
1,not worth it,my son just got this game and was looking forward to playing it he told me that he had to create an account before he could play the game in other words don't buy this game
1,"""Steamed"" over Half-Life 2","I'm so frustrated I don't know where to begin. I bought Half Life 2 expecting an outstanding gaming experience. What I got was hours of frustration trying to figure out how to make it boot up. In all my years of gaming, I simply needed to double-click the desktop icon and away I went. But some genius there at Valve decided to make the most convoluted, invasive and frustrating interface ever conceived in the world of gaming!!! Can I simply click the Half Life 2 icon for the GAME I PAID FOR and play? NOOOOOOO! I have to go through some online nonsense called Steam. One day I click the icon and I have the option to play in ""offline mode""; the next day I can't play because Steam won't let me. What were these people thinking!? I have uninstalled the game and have loaded up an old copy of GTA Vice City...now there's a game!Sincerely frustrated,KA StoneKernville, CA"
4,"The thinking man's FPS, and the best FPS ever.","First, I agree the install is a pain. But once you get past this HL2 is a fantaorgasmic treat for the senses. There are a lot of place you have to plan your strategery to get through.If you like FPS, this is the game for you."
5,BEST GAME SO FAR!,"Graphics: 11/10 Haven't seen a game surpass this yet, but you need a really fancy computer to play it.Gameplay: 11/10 Great phsyics, great guns, bunch of mods and i've made some myself!Replay: 11/10 you could really play this over and over again. it's never the same twice. Counter STrike is really fun too.Get this game, you'll love it. But make sure you have a good computer! At least 512 RAM and a good graphics card."
4,"Good game overall, but not the best I've played","Good game, however I didn't care to much for vehicals.... I know some of you are saying ""I liked the vehicals""... but I don't. Overall the game play was fun. Also didn't like the fact I had to use Steam (POS) took an hour and a half to get me playing... I was getting a little irritated after 20 min of waiting. .. I loved the original so I had to play this one. The game has overall good gameplay... a little slow in some spots but Graphics were good... ravens home (or whatever) was a bit cheesy... I gave it a 4 our of five because its a survival of the fitest in the gaming world... and Call of Duty was more exciting..."
3,"Very cool game, but....","No question about it, this is one of the most fun first-person shooters I have ever played. This game is wild, in terms of graphics or fighting enemies, I don't think there is anything out there that can surpass it.That said, the Steam Engine is a real negative, especially if you have a dial-up connection. This game would have been so much better without it! You have the option to play offline, but after awhile, the game compels you to be updated via internet -- which can take two hours or longer! This is not worth the $50 I paid for this game.It sounds like Valve is going to make a Half-Life 3. Great -- but I won't buy it if it means I have to be connected to the internet to play."
1,Are you people SANE?!,"Oh god. Here we go again. The hype of greatness is about to be squashed under the steel heel of Valve.Don't ANY of you get it? This game is NOT coming out in November, no way, no how. I bet ALL of you it's gonna come out sometime in spring 2005. My reasons? Check it out:1) Valve is SCARED to release the game, because they know that the modding community could make money out of its ""brilliant"" creations.2) The game is SOOO complex that it will take a WHOPPER of a computer to run. Valve's answer? Try and make the engine run on lower-spec computers, thus increasing preproduction time tenfold.3) One word: Competition. It's taken so long for Valve to get this stuff ready that the engine may look insignificant to upcoming games like Tribes 3 and Halo 2 (You all know it. They have to make a PC version.)I hope I saved many pre-orderers from months of frustration. Don't buy in yet. Just let Valve take its time..."
4,"Its not halo, but its good...........","...You heard me. Halo i s better since it is funner, and the pultiplayer is funer in halo. Halo 2 is even better. Go XBOX! oh yeah"
1,I'll believe it when I see it.,"The first Half-Life was a so-so crate jumping sort of experience. I'm not bashing the game yet. Don't get me wrong, it's just that I have heard all these tired claims before; flashy graphics, A.I. that can score a 1600 onthe S.A.T.'s, and other gimmicky blah blah blahs. It's hard to believe this could deliver more than Halo (or the soon to be Halo 2) in the way of A.I., physics, or gameplay. Until Half-Lifes combat evolves it just won't shine that bright."
3,Very Weird,"Over at Amazon.co.uk, a release date of September 3rd is still listed- why is there such a huge discrepancy between the UK and American sites? Come on Amazon, what's really going on?As for Half Life 2 itself... well, it looks good, and the physics look impressive in the clips seen, but until it's actually played, how can anyone write a review (indeed, how can I write all this?)I've played Doom 3, and found it to be a great, fun experience (and it's MEANT to be a simple blasting-at-bad-guys-thing, so don't complain about a lack of complexity), and I think Half Life 2 will need to meet it's hype to be as big and as enjoyable a gaming experience- it's the only game for me that can beat Doom 3."
5,Can't Wait,"The five stars is what I want, but we'll have to wait and see.I loved the first one and I remember when it first came out.I have high expectations for this game, but I also hope it dosn't take to much out of my computer.Half-Life revolutionized first person shooters and I can only hope that this one will go a step further."
1,"Good, but TOO real",I had played the first half-life and though it was pretty cool. The second is a whole new thing. The graphics are too real for me and its too reaistic. And although ive only played the demo: half-eaten bloody corpses and burned corpses with organs showing is where i draw the line! And i use the kids form for reviewing because its so much easier :)
1,I had too rate it too get my point across,"This is for all you people who rate games before they come out.half-life 2 is visually the most stunning looking game ever seen,but theres a competiter out there named halo2.I don't see why people think that half-life 2 will far be better than halo2.(which the first halo was much better than any of the first half-lifes).From seeing comparing half-life2 and halo2's features from previews.It looks like you can do much more on halo2 than half-life2.the first half-life wasnt that great anyway.sure half-life2 has all great graphics but as we know,great don't make a great game.so until both titles comes out in stores,nobody should be rating the game like its the dominent force of all games.when both games come out well see which one will be the better game."
2,Big let down.,Not what i expected. Game to hyped up.Since when do I need permission from Steam to play a game I purchased. And really 5 cd roms for an install. Game drags on and on.
3,hassel to install,"omg it took me 3 tries to install the game, finally finish installling then it took an hour to update, this game was a hassel to play at the begining. Hope u guys/ gals have better luck installing this game then me."
3,What is Steam?,"The gameplay is good, but some of the enemy troops & 'monsters' are unimaginative. They could have done alot better in the art dept. I remember being in awe playing ""Max Payne"" and was expecting the same , but it fell short. Also one MUST have a internet connection to connect to the 'Steam Network'. I don't want to play 'multi-player' but the game loads up in that mode sometimes. To play, i'm forced to reboot the game or the computer..ugh..it a pain. I paid $50+ for this thing and I ahve NO INTEREST in joining any 'club' or 'network'."
3,woof woof,im a doggie pet me woof woof!!! bark bark bark woof woof im a doggie half life 2 is not a doggie i am woof woof pet me grow!
3,Fun Game Great Technology - BUGGY AS HELL!!!!,"I love this game. The gameplay is what you expect from a HL game , the story is a cliffhanger at the end. The physics are absoultely great and add alot to the game. However Valve obviously didnt test this game engine(source) out enough. I get crashes all the time randomly with HL2 and CS: Source. I have never had a problem with any other game I own , have a kickass computer with well above the system reqs. Many others have had these problems too , and it hasnt been fixed yet , even though it has been out weeks. The lack of support is horrible when you have paid 50$ for something , and expect it to work. Id like to be able to play more than one round of counterstrike between crashes please Valve!!!"
1,this game can not be played,"i recieved this game as expected but the activation code required to play the game had already been used makeing the game useless, now i have to buy a new game for the code makeing me buy the same games twice which is not right the game half is a good game but you get scamed buying a used copy..."
4,"Great game, but big bugs","Very simply put, this is a great game - a very worthy sequel to the original. But there are some very real problems with the game that need to be worked out, too. Hopefully they will be, in time."
4,This game ROCKS!!!,"I'll agree with some that I was getting a little irritated that I couldn't just load it and go. But after I got it going it was AWESOME! Just like the original but way better. I guess expecting to quickly sign-up and play on the day the game was released was asking a lot. I did get on but it took an hour (cable modem). If I'm not mistaken, if you have 'Remember My Login' or something after you first get it going you no longer need to connect to the 'net to play.This game blows away Doom3 which I bought at full price. In that game it's 1) enter room, 2) kill monsters, 3) find power ups and repeat. HL2 is great with a story and awesome graphics and realistic (REALLY!) physics.I also have FarCry and it's cool but HL2 blows it away as well!"
1,junk,"should never been released all kinds of problems with there steam thing and game they say they are working on patchs at 54$ you would think you could get a game that would not crash on you can,t beleave they can get away with it"
1,not a multiplayer game,"They killed one of my favorite games. The anti-piracy crap makes this game almost unusable for multiplayer games, it requires you to log on via the internet with your cd in the drive(no lan pary sharing). Then I frequently get ""request denied"" type errors trying to start my game because their servers are busy I PAYED FOR THE GAME, WHAT DO YOU MEAN REQUEST!!!!. If game manufacturers think people will put up with garbage like ""steam"" logons to play a game i hope they find out diffrently. i can tell you i won't buy another steam product."
1,"This is the REVIEW area, not the promotion area.","Why the hell are people REVIEWING this game when it's not even out yet?? Now when it finally does come out, people will look at the currently 56 or so 5 star reviews and think it's a great game when it might not be. Amazon needs to prohibit people from reviewing until a product is released, if not what in the hell is the purpose of this section??"
1,"Very, very disappointed...!!!!!","""Steam"", I hate you. I don't say much more, just: save your money!!!!!"
2,Average game after you suffer through installation,"Seriously, I can't get past the pain this thing made me feel. I had to register, then wait for long download, then wait some more for decription of the game files, then had to see advertising for the other games they sell, and about 90 minutes after intalling the game (which is 5 CDs by the way), I was able to finally get to play it.But then there's the long load times. I takes 30 seconds to load the menu, mind you.The game itself is good, but just visually. I didn't find the story as engaging as the first game was.And if I think about the fact that I will not be able to sell this game ever (because now it's locked to my account), I think the whole thing wasn't worth it.Valve (better, Vivendi) is trying to push some new things down users' throats and make them standard business practice. The higher price and the Steam authentication are two of those bad ideas. I will probably not buy Valve games in the future."
1,As a protest I refuse to play this game,"You must register online before you can even play offline.This is ludicrous.This is also a very disturbing trend for a game - if you buy this one, you can expect to see more games use a similar scheme.What happens once you uninstall the game and it is no longer even supported years doen the road? You are out of luck. They could just as easily decide to stop supporting it once the next version is out and force you to upgrade.Stop the madness now before it gets out of hand or we will all come to regret it and pc gaming will be choked out of existence."
1,Dont understand??,"I dont see any fun in this game....I played Half life one and though ""wow this is a rather boring game in which all I do is push crates"" and the storyline was boring as well!!!!!! So when I tried Half Life 2 I wasnt anymore impressed....the enemies looked real but when I filled them full of lead it didnt FEEL like it...and the puzzles were irritating...they were easy to work out...but I wanted an FPS not another version of hyped up super speed tetris!!!!!!!! And Again the storyline wasnt very exciting...they tell you bugger all and then the end is treated like a twist?????I can say Halo/Halo2 were good came because they were what they claimed....FPS's....they had good storylines/a cool universe and when I killed the 'bad guys' I enjoyed every moment of it....and that is why I dont like the Half Life franchise....."
3,No Good Multiplayer,"Long knowing that I've played Half-Life because of it's Multiplayer... I expected Half-Life 2 to rival games like UT2004... Graphics wise, the game is great, but I could care less about single player play... I was searching for another good muliplayer game... CounterStrike is the only multiplayer in it, and I think it is kind of boring because when you die, it's over till the next match... No other type of multiplayer game, not even deathmatch... So consider that before buying......neo"
3,"souless, repetitive game","This game has great graphics, smooth framerates, and realistic physics. Unfortunately, it has forgetable boss battles and is highly repetitive. I felt like I was in that airboat for weeks killing generic soldiers. In these respects, the game is much like Doom 3, which I also was disappointed with. For a recent great game, I recommend getting Resident Evil 4 for the GameCube or Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox."
1,HUGE LET DOWN,"OK - the graphics are awesome. Stream is a pain... Hours to load!! Gravity gun is way cool, but that's the only cool weapon... It is not half the game half life one was... no pun intended. There aren't many new creatures, most of the fighting is with humans...ZZZZZZZ And they still have head crabs!! Come on - couldn't they come up with more?Finally - why I gave it only 1 star is I finished the entire thing in 2 weekends..... It's too freaking short! The ending stinks! And it's not worth a replay... What a ripoff! HUGE ripoff!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Nice toy, could use a little something more",I got this for my son last Christmas. He is now 4 1/2 and has never spent much time playing with it. He saw it in a magazine and asked for it over and over so Santa brought it. It was apparently less impressive in person because we did not get much use out of it. He does like using the little pulley system to make the bucket go up and down but that is about it.
5,WE L O V E THIS ITEM!!!,Only thing is it does require certain parts to be glued even though the directions do not indicate. But once you glue it it is very sturdy. I love this so much I actually purchased it twice!
4,tree house,Great item.Well made but some of the feet came off of the dolls. Actually too sedate for energetic 5 year old boy but would be perfect for a girl or less active boy. Perhaps a younger child but has received very little play for my 5 year old grandson. It is still cute and good concept.
2,Very nice Portable,"I wanted to add that the pet1000 can do PAL to NTSC conversion,and does it very well just make sure that you keep the player in the NTSC mode in the general setup page under TV TYPE when playing a PAL dvd. Yes, it will convert PAL so you can watch it on NTSC tv's using the output from the player.Very versitile portable indeed,and there's a reigon hack as well."
5,Philips 10.2 portable DVD,"I love my new player...the picture is great, it is easy to use, and it has a usb port...speakers aren't the greatest, but I have some portable ones and use a headset much of the time anyway..."
3,Loud drive,Just got this from J&R. The drive is loud even after the DVD loads. Not a biggie since I plan on using it on a plane for my son.
4,A good portable DVD,Overall I find this unit to be very good. I also agree with most of the other reviews. However I wanted to add a con not mentioned in the other reviews. On my unit the DVD's have to be perfect in order to play. Any small scratch that would still be playable on your main DVD player or your laptop will not play on this unit. It will simply hang up and not play.Buffing the DVD with a repair kit will not help. I had to resort to making a copy of the DVD in order to play with this unit. I suggest looking over your DVD's carefully. If any have a scratch dont expect it to play.
3,Good for its time,overall a good entry into the survival genre but it has a few points that could be done better (and have in later games).1. when building a structure or any other item it builds it where the supplies are and can't seem to be specified elsewhere (bad idea as the supplies are brought to the campfire)2. even though your person has a jug of water they don't automatically drink it (you must micro-manage all aspects of the game)other than these 2 items i found this to be a good game well worth the price paid.
3,Survival,"Everything Psyko says is true except after playing nonstop for three days I have yet to figure out how to put a roof on my huts, how to light the signal fires for help, or how to get my character to get aboard the raft to go for help!!! My biggest problem with the game is that each action your characters perform requires too much input on your part. For example, if you want your character to gather water, you have to click on the water container for them to pick it up, then click on the river for them to fill it up, then click on the location you want them to take the water container, then click for them to put the container down. Too much work on my part! But if anyone could tell me how to put those roofs on, light those signal fires, or get on the raft I'd be much less frustrated!"
2,very basic and boring,This movie was about a guy catching and tagging Anacondas in the mud. WOw how exciting.
3,"Good case, but expensive","i bought this case, thought it was good, then i saw a cheaper one on the playstation website! dont bother with this just buy the one on the playstation site"
3,Eh... So-so bag...,"The bag's materials are great, but the design for the utilities that it is suppose to carry is pretty cramped. What I really don't like about the bag is the material line for the pouch for the console, because the fabric line can easily be scratched and then break up. Another thing is that it seems the console should not include a horizontal stand, because in order to put the console in the bag, you would need to force it in. Eh... but what the hay, it does a fine job of protecting the console with its thick linings and looks quite sporty. Need another solution to carrying your PS2 instead of the normally backpack? This is your bag!"
3,Its OK,"Ok, this bag is great for carrying your mad expensive PS2 around...that is, if you dont plan to take it out. It is so hard to take the PS2 out of the bag because it is packed in there. And no, 4 contollers??? never, i fit 2 and the wires for the PS2 and i cant fit much else. Besides the space issue, this is one of the best cases I ever had. GET IT!"
1,Pre packaged,this toy has prepackaged cards i noticed because there was glue on the back of the card where you openi advise you to buy some other package of japanese Pokemon cards
4,Intriguing insites to Korea's regional religious practices,"This book covers the religious practices of the mountain people of Korea. I was surprised to see not only eastern religious practices noted, but christianity's impact as well. David Mason shows me the what and why's of the mountian people's faith. The color plates compliment the words daring to tell the story on their own.This book delves into medicinal practices, which are deeply rooted in the beliefs of the mountain folk. I have enjoyed this book tremendously."
5,"warning, this product may cause sleep loss","Thanks a lot, Treat-Umms. Before we discovered your product, we used to sleep in, say, to 7:30 AM or so. Since we have been giving our 6 dogs (5 chihuahuas and a Japanese Chin) Chicken & Sweet Potato Wraps as a morning treat, they have trained us to get up at 5:30 every morning, or earlier, to get their little mouths wrapped around one of these wraps. They are relentless. And of course, being fairly intelligent and trainable, we have complied with their wishes completely. (BTW, one of our chi's has a liver condition, and these treats agree with him just fine.) This product is highly recommended (unless, of course, you value your sleep).Signed, Sleepless in A-town"
1,"Expensive, and my dog hates them","What more can I say? I usually buy this kind of treat at our local discount shopping center, but I realized those dumbells were made in China, and that made me nervous after all the quality control problems China has had with pet foods and treats. If I remember correctly, I think these are made in the US, so I felt better about giving these to my dog. Too bad she wouldn't eat them. Picky, picky!"
3,Too difficult,"I bought this game for my 4 year old and we liked it, it was fun whe we began, but sometimes the woozles would come and I had to do it, because it was too hard for my son to outrun them, Pooh can't run, it takes him a long time to get from place to place, and as we got farther in the game the woozles apeared more and more and got too hard for even me to pass. It drove me crazy and I finally told my son we could play it anymore. It's way too hard!"
5,Excellent introduction to harlem crooner...,"Cab Calloway had the swingin'-est band in Herlem, and he sang with a zany-ness we wouldn't see till 20 years later in Louis Prima. This absolutly essentail CD in the Classics series is highly recommended, as is 1930-1931, and all the voumes following. Essental music..."
3,Heavy Reggae Mix,"MadLib is still the man, but I'm not as sold on this reggae mix of his. That's just me. If you dig reggae and know anything about MadLib, buy this album."
2,A mediocre at best survival horror game,This game is like the Resident Evil games but worse. It's not at all scary. I'm sorry but Zombies and monsters are MUCH more scarier than Velociraptors and the T-Rex. This is just a RE clone which in itself isn't bad except the way that the plot goes and how they made the game makes it so it's not at all scary. Oh well. If you're really into the genre then it's worth a rental but otherwise don't waste your time.
4,"Great design, almost great function","I had to hunt high and low to find an alarm clock that looked as though it had been designed, something with intentional aesthetic appeal. Finally found this one at about 90% off (would never have paid full price for it, probably not even 75% of the new price), and am quite happy with the look and the fuction. I wish it had a radio, but I've gotten over that. The one flaw in the design is functional, not aesthetic: It's a bit tipsy. It needs to be a little thicker (i.e. wider at the base). I say this having only knocked it over once in three years, but am always scared it's going to crash onto the dresser surface at 6am when I turn the alarm off and wake up the wife."
4,Heavy duty pegboard hooks,"I wanted to get some heavy duty hooks for 1/4 thick peg board. I didn't want the dual thickness hooks which are much thinner material. These fit the bill. It provides a nice assortment for general purpose items.The only drawback I have is that some tools, when removed, can loosen or even take the hook off. It just takes some extra precaution when removing tools. After I get all the tools into the appropriate spots, I plan to put a little adhesive on that lower peg to make them more secure."
4,Interesting book. very well written,The fact that Robert Besnon convert from his Anglican faith to Catholicism is one of the facotrs making his book soo appealing.I love it!
1,Cartridge did not work with my Epson Photo 820 as advertised,"That pretty much sums it up, I put it in like I would any cartride and my printer refused to recognize it. it knew it was there, but it said it was incompatable."
5,You Can't Miss with Magic School Bus Software,Magic School Bus has been a great way to get our kids interested in science of all kinds. They come back to these CD's again and again (some of them we've had for a couple of years). The graphics are good and the games are fun and educational. The solar system CD was especially great -- the kids learned not only to name all the nine planets (in order) but also understood and remembered lots of interesting facts about space.
1,obsolete software that doesn't work with win2k,"these seem like very old titles, written for win/3.1 and possibly working on win/95, but incompatible with the modern microsoft operating systems. out of 3 titles, two failed to install on my child's win2k system at all. one installed, but didn't function right. its graphics are the 10 year old primitive 256 color 640x480 VGA, 2-dimensional and flat. the game's audio wouldn't turn on. i can only guess that the other 2 titles were even more antique. a major dissapointment, because science related titles for small kids are so rare and hard to find!i have encountered other children's titles that were poorly written for win/3.1 or older versions of windows, and hadn't been updated in 10 years, which wouldn't install or run right under win2k, but these are titles published by microsoft itself!!!"
1,terribe product,"I have no idea where to start, other than I wish I had installed it as soon as i bought it. That way I would have been able to return it. Im running XP, wire and wireless. the server works when it wants to work. and my HP1218 printer simply will not work. This product is sitting on a shelf now. I cant believe linksys put this out on the market. What a horrible product!"
2,"Not fully compatible, 'iffy' documentation","After spending a lot of time fiddling with this I had mixed results. I was able to get an OKI printer to work, but not my HP Deskjet 720C. I went to HP's site to learn how to disable bi-directional printing, which I did and tried again - still no luck. I finally got a hold of Linksys tech support (1.5 hour callback), only to be told that the 720c was an unsupport printer. They don't have a list of unsupported printers available anywhere except within Linksys (why not on the web?). The docs were also weak on explaining how to use the unit with a DHCP server, and the information on the Dip switch settings is 100% incorrect! They documented the switches upside down and the real information is available from their support page.I'm taking it back and trying something else..."
1,A Networking Nightmare,My local lan is completely linksys. I bought the epsx3 because I have three printers I would like to share. This device has been a nightmare. I cannot get XP to even notice it is on the network. I tried linksys technical support and they were completely non sympathic to my problems. The windows 98 pc can print to one printer attached to the device but not to any of the others. I have even removed the device software from all machines and reinstalled the software and device. No luck. I am extremely disappointed as the other lan devices from linksys work fairly well. Do not buy.
2,"No support, Bad Docs","Was able to get it to work sometimes. Was able to set the IP address the first time, but after that I couldn't change it or get it to work reliable with DHCP. Got absolutely no response from email to support site, unable to get through for phone support, unable to use it with Unix systems. I'm getting rid of it and going with an HP."
5,RIVETING and WELL DONE,This is one of the best books I have read. You get a view of life from a different prospective.
5,"MOVING, DISTURBING and GRIPPING",I was very moved by the book. It is a real eye-opener to mental illness.
1,Dull,"Main flaw is the junior-high school level writing: inability to string two sentences together properly, stagnant course, dead flat content. Man, what a stinker!"
1,not what youd expect,bought this to make 2005 honda civic stock seat more comfortable. It only made stock seat more desireable to sit in without seat cover. ill admit the idea behind the lumbar support and the side cusions on the back and seat seamed appealing. but upon sitting in it for less than 30 mins i wanted my old seat back. it felt like it was pushing me up and out of my seat. the side cusions felt like they were rejecting you instead of engulfing you (which is what i expexted) and the same for the bottom.i felt like i was sitting on top of it instead of in it. the pleather smelled terrible (you knew it was fake)and top of it all it didnt even fit like i thought it should. the headrest area was extremly loose (like loose skin)and i tried everything to get the rest tight but the tie straps dont seem strong enough i thought they woul rip i tried so hard. so i said oh well what do you expect for 20 bucks. can u say return?
5,Best thing since sliced bread!!,"I actually purchased this, in the box, at a yard sale for $1. I wasn't sure about wether it would really work and had no idea how expensive it was on the Internet but the price was right. I brought it home where it sat in my garage for nearly a year until we needed a laminator for Family Fun Day at work. We were going to let the kids make badges for themselves and needed something that could be used outside (no electricity) and was safe (no heat). I dug this out of the garage, read on the side what kind of refills to get and ordered from Amazon for about $22. After receiving the refill cartidge it took about 5 minutes to pull out the old one and set the new one in..........there are pictures on the box to follow........and we were off. Everyone liked it so much, several people are going to buy their own. This now sits in our office instead of our garage and we use it every chance we get! It is very light weight and even my 75-year-old mother can use it with ease!"
2,Not the same thing,"The movie was great, but the album is not. It was re-recorded, and the songs are not as dynamic as they are in the movie. If you want the real soundtrack, you just have to listen to the movie."
3,No chrome grid,"The description clearly says ""it includes a heavy-gauge chrome grid in the middle for hanging additional pots, pans, or spoons"". This was a major factor in my purchasing this item and it did not include a chrome grid. Otherwise it looks nice."
4,Super,I haven't set it up yet but when I open it I like it. Now I have to decide where I hang it up.
4,Pot rack,The pot rack was just wht I needed for a small area. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it does not have a shelf for lids small objects. It looks much classier than others of comprable price.
5,a former nuclear submariner,"Excellent! ""Controversial"" only begins to describe the intense but very mixed feelings that Navy nucs have toward The Admiral. This book gets under the surface, and shows the man with all his foibles as well as his strengths and achievements. He was a brilliant engineer and leader, but Niccolo Machiavelli could also have learned a great deal from studying his political methods."
5,Great mix of fun and serious songs,"Confederate Railroad obviously like to have a good time, but they don't limit themselves to the fun songs as three sad songs (Right track wrong train, See ya, Sounds of home show. Where or when, about a man who does what his woman wants, and Toss a little bone, about a man begging for a reward, are more typical of the album.My favorite song here is Bill's Laundromat bar and grill, which tells a great story about an evening's entertainment. Kenny Chesney co-wrote a great father-and-son song, When he was my age, though I'm not sure if he recorded it himself. All I wanted and Oh no are great lightweight songs. The closing track, My baby's lovin', is a cover of a Delbert McClinton song.If you only buy one Confederate Railroad album, you should buy their untitled debut album. While this album is not quite that good, it has much to commend it."
3,Descent CD for Confederate Railroad,"Ranging from Mediocre to Good based on the track, definately not their best stuff, but descent."
1,Mike Myers ...,This book is the worst book I have ever read that claims to prep you for the 70-215 exam. it covers only the very basics of the operating system and its functions. after reading this book and then doing practice tests online I found that almost 3/4 of the questions I was being asked about windows 2000 server where not even in this book or where just barley mentioned at all. If you want to pass the exam please do not wast your time on this book.
4,Very nice change from Kippers,Very good product. The added smoke makes them a real treat. I was surprized to see that both layers had cracked pepper on them. I would eat these all the time except the price is a little high but hey what's a treat for! The sunflower oil is a plus. The oil is good for you and it doesn't cover the flavor of the fish.
4,"Good fish, crushed cans","The fish is wonderful. Smokey and salty, it hits the same buttons as bacon but it's actually good for you. The bad news is that three of the cans in the case I received were partially crushed. The cans were not broken and the contents were OK, but they need to protect them better for shipping."
4,"High quality fish, sustainable, but too salty","This canned mackerel is of very high quality, and it is caught sustainably. Some of the cans were dented, but not broken. The fish was too salty for my taste (>30% daily value for sodium per can !). I will go back to Vital Choice with no salt or Bar Harbor brand if I can find them."
3,Misleading Photo,"I thought we were getting the enormous bundle for the price I paid, which I thought was a deal. Instead it turned out to be a small pack of the twists. Could have gotten these in person for the same amount elsewhere."
3,A little too cheap,"The card works great until the dongle (the black cord that connects cable to card) breaks, and it breaks pretty easily, i have had two and neither lasted more than 4 months without breaking."
3,"Great price, but its driver is not compatible with Win 2K","I love the price, but it is very frustrating after I found out that the driver is not compatible with Win 2k even if the box is written ""Win 2000 Ready"". I actually called the Linksys technical support and they said the MIS engineers messed up. Well, Win 2k recognizes the card but it requires a file named ""pc100nd5.sys"" which does not exist. Without this file, the driver will not be installed correctly. Linksys said they will fix it ASAP and post the new driver on the web soon. (Yeah right)"
2,Better things out there.....,This product although not defective in perfomance is not a wise investment since the it's dopple design is easily breakable. If you are interested in a perfomance and durability i suggest the Linksys Etherfast 10/100 Integrated PC Card. Since it is integrated there is minimal chance that it will break and uses only one slot on your PC. Plus the price difference is minimal and you get much more for value.
1,works but not durable,"It worked for, me but the connection between the card and black cable is not durable. I went thru 2- I'm slow to learn lessons. IMHO I suggest a one piece item. I switched to Netgear only because the other linksys product was temporatily unavailable."
1,design defect?,"My experience is that, after a few months of usage, the weight of the dongle has bent something on the card cutting off the connection. So the card has stopped working. It seems the connector is too flimsy."
2,A little Flimsey,"I bought this because of it's price and when it worked it was great. You get what you pay for though, the cable sucks, very flimsy. I move my notebook very little and it still managed to get loose and fall out after only 2 months. I just ordered a new card without a dongle cable, I'm hoping I won't have to deal with it again."
2,Fragile Dongle,"Great card, until dongle broke about a year later. Otherwise, no problems while it lasted."
3,"Fast, but dongle breaks too easily.","This product is easy to install on a home network. Just plug and go. The problem lies in the dongle. I have had two of them in the last six months. After a while they just stop working, and this is frustrating because replace dongle costs..."
2,Cheap Connector,"I'm no wiz at this stuff, but I strongly advise against purchasing this Ethernet set-up. Although it was easy to install, and worked well until it broke,the ""dongle"" that plugs into the laptop is flimsy and breaks readily. Mine broke within 5 weeks."
2,Dongle breaks too easily,"I'm pretty careful with my hardware, but the dongle on this card broke off far too easily (in fact I have yet to see a dongle survive serious use). Integrated cards do not cost much more. The only reason you might want this is if you really need to be able to have something stick out of a second PCMCIA slot."
2,"""dongle"" broke","the product works fine - cheap and easy to set up, but the coupler or ""dongle"" as i've heard it called that hooks up the card to the ethernet cable is very delicate and mine broke after just a couple months of use."
2,Skatepark tycoon???????,"When I saw the title of this game I though WOW cool a skatepark game. I thought since the title said tycoon that this game would be just as good as the original roller coaster tycoon, and boy was I wrong. First off I had a super hard time trying to load it onto my pc. My pc is far better that the system requirements and it still wouldn't load. Then when I finally got it to load and tried it it was far WORST than i expected. The grafics were OK but RCT was way better. You only have sertant ramps you can choose from and the whole idea was just bad. Overall don't get this game and spend your valuble money on this junk!! Get a real skateboard game and get Tony Hawk."
1,cheap crap!,"This game at first, sounds like a lot of fun but quickly you will find out that it isn't much fun at all. The game concept is excellent and would make an awsome game if it wasn't made so cheaply. The game graphics even on a top of the line computer are very sketchy and pixelated, the gameplay is long, boring, and confusing. Also the game leaves no room for growth for more experienced players( if you could get any experience in it) to move above and beyond the game basics. Overall I think this game could have been a top seller but wasn't made to quality standards and ended up being crap!"
4,Excellent,"I think that game is good. Not like you guys!! The sound are good and the music is well recorded. Punk Rock!! I have played the game 7 hours. It's beautiful, the graphics also. To high man!! Thanks. Lc Lc@s6"
5,lover of jewelry,Pretty bracelet. Charms are larger than the picture. Brought one for myself and my daughter and we both love it. Very chic.
1,Too wordy,"Yes, this writer does have a grasp of the English Language, but it's from the 16th century. The prose is too overblown, too wordy. One of the other reveiwers here had it right, she spent too much time with a thesaurus, and not enough with the plot. I read the book until page 150 then had to put it down, because I had no idea what was going on. I read alot, I'm not dumb, but this is really a waste of money. Stick with King and Koontz for electrifying reads. It seems that every time I try a new writer, I get something totally worthless."
1,A-Void at all costs!,"Teri A. Jacobs' prose is so stiflingly purple that I'm shocked she's been published at all. This author makes all the mistakes that a 10th grader might make on a creative writing homework assignment; she actually believes that being purple and flowery are good things in a story. Every time I made a serious effort to delve into the book, the author's hyper-overblown style knocked me right out again. I can't even tell you what the plot is because my head was spinning just trying to make sense of the narrative voice. Forget this one. A-Void!"
4,Not an easy read for people who need pictures,"Teri reminds me of an early Clive Barker and that is awesome now that Barker is going through a historical romance phase! Teri writes with flair and she does get a little wordy at times but her imagery and attention to detail outweigh any negatives her wordiness may cause.Ms Jacobs writes with passion and is close to becoming the Queen of Scream in the horror field. They are few and far between. Some of the top females writing horror include Tamara Thorne, Elizabeth Massie, and Poppy Z Brite. Holdovers Nancy Holder and Nancy Collins are always good for a scream or two.Teri is adept and quite skillful at eviscerating people with her words and her characters in her books. She knows that fear is not just gore and violence, but suspense and spine-tingling gooseflesh.She is in a word: good."
1,Unreadable,This book is unreadable. I got to page four and gave up. The author is redundant and far too impressed with lengthy strings of adjectives to tell any kind of story. How this drek received as many blurbs as it did is beyond me. The blurbs are the best part of the book--as long as you realize they are fiction.
5,Excellent first naove,I was amazed with this novel. I could not put it down. It is a quick read that leaves you wanting more. I did not want the story to end. The characters are well developed and the story is well researched. I am eagerly awaiting Teri's second book.
5,Gets into your head,"In THE VOID, Teri Jacobs tells an interesting story that happensto be dripping with vivid and gruesome images, as well asunexpected moments of humor. I was definitely drawn in by thebeautiful prose; there were things in this book I'd never readbefore-Jacobs is a fearless storyteller who knows how to grabyour attention. This was a genuinely frightening and intelligent book, filled with all sorts of malicious fun."
4,Great book for slav beginners.,"This is a great first book on the Slav. Sadler's writing is witty and humorous making the book a pleasure. Sadler is big on the themes and ideas behind the various lines in the Slav. He is a little short on detailed analysis (which I won't remember anyway). This book will not appeal to players over 1800 USCF. However if you, like me, are just an average club player who needs a solid but active defense against 1. d4, this is a great book."
4,An Entry Level Slav Book -- The Best One Yet Published,"I've read this from cover to cover. Sadler gives you the general idea of what is going on in each of the lines he reviews and gives you his opinions of what he thinks is best. He tells you up front about the tricky move order issues in the Slav. Reading this book allows you to play the Slav but I think it will take most average players years to play it well. Due to publisher constraints, which I think Sadler hints at in the introduction, this book is far from exhaustive. Early divergences are not considered to any noticeable degree. For that you need the Burgess book on the Slav. To get to know the major ideas of the more well know lines, Sadler's book is the right choice. I give it 4 stars for what the book does with limited pages."
3,More info could have been helpfull,They use specifications on these things that doesnt relate to the shop window version of the product you purchase. i.e. I have a Spirit E320. I had to find a product code and then couldnt find the specification of the regulater. So I bought this in the hope that is was OK. It fitted ok and does the job although the pipe is a bit short. Go for the longer hose if you have a spirit!
5,hauntingly beautiful,"Jeff Bjorck plays with a haunting beauty that is at once melancholy and yet joyful. With a richness that reveals a marvelous depth of soul, PURE PIANO PANORAMAS creates the perfect ambiance for reflection, sharing, or creating. Bjorck's remarkable gift for touching the heart makes him one of the most memorable artists today."
2,Poor Voice Recorder Quality,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas (not at Amazon). I thought it would be great for while we were travelling in our motorhome. Having the notepad and pen at your fingertips is great, but you can barely hear the playback of your recording. The quality of the recording is bad and the sound level is almost nonexistant. I would definitely not purchase this again."
5,Perfect fit,"I just recentely bought a PSOne with the 5"" LCD Screen with the intention of going mobile with my video gaming experience. I also bought the bag. The price was good and it fits everything perfectly. I have the PSOne with the 5"" LCD Screen attached, 8 games, 2 controllers, the AC adapter, a couple of memory cards, and the car adapter in it, and everything fits nice. One thing to mention is that the bag comes with two CD cases that hold 4 games each, so that's how you can get 8 games into it. I have no problems taking the system and accessories out of the bag and putting them back in. I purchased the SONY 5"" screen, and like I said, everything fits perfect. By reading other reviews about things not fitting right, I am wondering if it is a different story if a third party screen is purchased."
5,PS one Game System Carrying Case,"Take PlayStation with you -- the PS ONE SYSTEM CARRYING CASE is just the right size to take your PS one and PlayStation games anywhere you go. With two zippered compartments, this carrying case can hold the PS one game console, two controllers, eight games, extra memory cards, and all the cords and cables needed for your PS one system. Also featured is a cellular phone pocket, front and inside mesh pockets (with zippers on the front pocket), a ToteMaster adjustable padded strap, and two 4-capacity game Smart Cases."
2,It worked great for a while,"I recently purchased a network in a box kit. On the box it states it works with DSL and cable. I started out with a ME machine connecting to a 98 machine, after installation all worked fine. I upgraded the ME machine to win2000 and I now am having trouble configuring the 98 machines internet access, printer sharing works fine. I am sharing DSL internet access thru the 2000 machine. I have called tech support a couple of times but I always get a different answer, the last guy told me to buy a router without even asking what my configuration was. If he would have explained the reasoning for this he might have sold me. I had one guy tell me he didn't have time to help me configure this and he hung up on me. I am not happy with the customer service so far.... Maybe tech support should spend as much time with me as I do on hold and getting thru the phone system. If I have to buy a router I will, but I am not sure I would buy a product from them again."
4,Linksys FENSK05 EtherFast Ethernet 10/100 Network in a Box,"Quick, easy. I agree with the previous review regarding the drivers. You kinda search around for the file location, but after that & a reboot, away we went. We're not doing anything fancy with it. Sharing a dial-up connection for Pete's sake, but it works great! I'd recommend this to anyone for their first network."
5,First Home Network/Great for sharing cable modem,"The Linksys FENSK05 Network In a Box is easy to install. It worked immediately after reboot. Documentation was not clear when installing the driver from the floppy. You need to browse to the correct directory for the operating system being used. I specifically wanted share my cable modem connection. Configuring Internet Connection Sharing was somewhat of a problem since I had never done it, but it works great. Well worth the price."
2,NOT for cable modem sharing,"The network works fine, but if you're interested in a home LAN for sharing cable modem access, this is not the way to go. It's technically possible to do this, but requires additional software and lots of headaches."
5,Great book to give 1st time Grandparents,"I enjoy giving this book to 1st time Grandparents. It is good for both the Grandmother and Grandfather. My husband and I have enjoyed reading this to our two grandsons. With the bright pictures and animal characters, it keeps their attention and they seemed to enjoy every minute of it."
4,Very heartfelt and touching,"This book was very different than War Cries, but just as passionately written. It's appatent that the author has lived through some very meaningful relationships. It makes you long to have that kind of closeness in a reltionship. Yet it's very simple and sincere. If you are a big poetry fan you should consider this a must read. Can't wait for your next book because this one leaves you wanting more...."
5,Explores dozens of black trail blazers over the centuries,"The Almanac Of African American Heritage features people, places, times and events which shaped black culture and is written by four Afro-American professionals of education and counseling. From the earliest slave ships to cross the Atlantic to modern times, this explores dozens of black trail blazers over the centuries."
4,Totally Awsome!,"The main reason why i bought this CD because i really liked their last one. Even though Album sounds a bit different its pretty good. Smash Mouth songs always put me in a better mood and they can be fun to dance to. I liked most the songs on this CD maybe there was a couple i'm not too crazy over, but its rare to find a CD with 100% good songs ya know? LOL. well anyway if you don't like pop/rock you really have no business buying this CD. If ya do then i deffinitally recommend it! Its a MUST HAVE! ^_^ i think i've listened to this CD like at least 25-30 times already...ok call me obsessed!"
2,Urp,"Make it stop, make it STOP!!!!! To many bands are selling out to MTV and Carson Daley. I admit, I loved these guys when the were a Ska-Punk band on Fu Shu Mang, but now... I don't know what happened. Astro Lounge was at least slightly decent, but if you haven't already guessed, I despise this, loathe it. Of course my tastes have changed, and its still a good Album for pop listeners who want to pretend to be cool and listen to rock. If you are looking for a decent punk/rock band try Greenday, or for a little more pop feel go with EvE6's Horrorscope or self titled debute."
3,Its a cool CD!,"This CD rocks the house down for a Smash Mouth fan like me, but for the average joe on trhe street the CD would be be no more than a occatoinal beat. I absolutly adore ""Your Man"" in track two.In fact, I think I'm obsessed with the song a little. ""Pacific Coast party"" is an upbeat song about... well, partying and it deserves a look at. I personally think that the CDs cool and is well worth the [amt]"
4,Psychodelic Happy Feelings,"This albums is just beautiful. ""I'm a Believer"" is nice, but put it aside for a moment. What makes Smash Mouth so great is that they haven't conformed--they're rhythm and style is exactly the same as it was in Fush Yu Mang and they've managed to keep their momentum going. This band is who you listen to when you've had a terrible day (or night) and you need something to get you going. You just can't sit still during their disco renditions or with ""Sister Psychic"" (my personal favorite). If you like mellow, slow, depression songs--they've got that too! Smash Mouth is for everyone except those depressing self-indulged bastards who can't stand to smile (cough, damn intellectuals). Sit back and enjoy this album--it's just fun, baby."
1,holiday in my head would not include them,When I got this cd I dunno wut I was thinking!! This is terrrible the only song that offers something different is pacific coast party which isnt that good...DONT BUY THIS
3,kind of good,"I am a Smashmouth fan so I bought this CD when it had just come out. I thought that the music would be good because it was by Smashmouth. I was wrong.Don't get me wrong, this CD's not bad, its just okay. None of the songs on this CD will get any airplay on the radio & I think that none of the songs really do except for maybe Shoes n Hats.Other than that song the CD is pretty much a bust if you buy it. Some of the others are tolerable but nowhere near as good as any of the songs on East Bay Sessions, which was released in 1999 for any of you who havent heard of it."
1,"wow, what a terrible album that I didnt want!","For starters, I hate BMG. They suckered me into joining their club, and now they pay me back by sending me this [junk]. I sent the card in late, so I was overjoyed when this arrived. That was sarcasm.I figured, since I paid for it, I guess I should at least listen to it once. I tried, folks, I did. The first song was too much for me. It is way too ""happy"" for me. Don't get me wrong, I don't listen exclusive ""angsty"" music, but this is where I draw the line. To me, the music that Smashmouth is pushing would be more fitting to be done by the Muppets.And whats with the band pushing themselves to look ""tough"" on the album cover? Its really unsoothing, and aside from the goofy orange, it doesnt really seem representative of their style. But I guess that you truly can't judge an album by their cover."
1,A VERY CRAPPY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION ALBUM,"I should have known from the name of the album that they were running out of ideas. Even the artwork in the cd-booklet [is bad]. The only tolerable songs are PACIFIC COAST PARTY, SISTER PSYCHIC, and I'M A BELIEVER. Most of the songs have no memorable lyrics, rythyms, or melodies. Wait for another ""best of"" album because this one isn't worth the money."
3,"Good CD, more poppy than last 2.","The latest release from Smash Mouth is good, but poppier than the others. ""I'm A Believer"" and ""Your Man"" bump this rating up to 3 stars."
4,Listing by priority reading,"Berlinski's is quite a fine book, but it is my firmly held opinion that ""While Europe Slept"" by Bruce Bawer is the clear priority read for those concerned with these crucial matters.Claire Berlinski's approach is a story-telling tack that permits readers to draw guided conclusions by means of the informative situational vignettes she provides, while Bruce Bawer's approach is to clearly define, delineate and describe the situation in Europe with utmost clarity.After checking-in with Bawer, add Claire Berlinski's fine book to the mix."
5,Army Officer,"Look, if you're already convinced America should be more like Europe, then spare yourself the frustration and stay away from this book, because nothing Claire Berlinski says will change your mind anyway. But unlike the other books on this subject (Bawer, Phillips, & Steyn - all informative in their individual perspectives) Berlinski puts the European mind into context. This book is a wake up call for the fence-sitters. It is well written, insightful, and, to all you Bove followers, splendidly offensive."
5,A different look at the major challenge of our time.,Wonderful introspection which gets right to the heart of the problem.
1,Trite,"Ms. Berlinski, a reasonably articulate world traveler, presents her thesis on page 11: ""A morally unmoored Eurpoe, imploding under the wright of social and economic pressures...poses a threat to American interests and objectives everywhere on the planet."" ""We share its problems."" (p.15)Ms. Merlinski, sees Europe's problems as our problems--not surprising given the time she's spent there.Her fundamental thesis is seriouisly flawed, though understandable given her perspective. Europe's problems are Europe's, and can only be solved by Europe. (Besides, the worse thing we could do is offer solutions.) An equally flawed thesis would be to say that Africia's problems are our problems, China's problems our our problems,and Mexico's problem's our...since numerous immigrants to the US have connections there.The book moves slowly. Relies on the reiteration of commonly known news items. And offers only superficial analysis. Save your $25.95"
2,Horribly Biased,"It seems that when Ms. Berlinksi decided to write this book, her goal was to try and equate the mistakes of europes past (recent and not so recent) to the blunders of the Bush administration. This book is a book for republicans, thinly veiled in ""facts"". It does present a few good points, but on the whole if it were any more biased it might as well have been called ""Dubyas guide to the rest of the world"". Not worth the money."
5,"Barnabas Collins, where are you?!","This exquisite book - which has sadly been out of my library for a while now - is THE ""Dark Shadows"" companion. Everything is here, from the original daytime soap to the shooting of the movieHouse of Dark Shadows. You'll read about Dan Curtis, the man who created it all, and the photos are spectacular along with the detailed, lively text. Any fan who wants an overview - and a nice taste - of ""Dark Shadows"" must have this book."
4,AGELESS - YOU WILL LISTEN AND REMEMBER WHEN,"THIS IS THE FEELINGS IN THE 1970'S WHEN BETTE FIRST APPEARED WITH JOHNNY ON THE TONITE SHOW WEARING HER COLORFUL OUTFITS AND MAKING US ALL LAUGH. ""MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE"" MAKES YOU SWAY AND THINK OF YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH NEW LOVE. THEN ""YOU DON'T KNOW ME"" IS BURNING PAIN OF NO TRUTH IN LOVE. ""EMPTY BED BLUES"" IS JUST BETTE! OPEN COMEDY THAT LEAVES YOU WITH A GRIN.I COULD GO ON ABOUT EACH CUT - ALL SO INDIVIDUAL - BUT ALL BETTE. SO PLEASED TO HAVE THIS ON CD- MY LP IS WORN OUT."
4,A nice change,"This CD is was a nice depature from Miss M's other albulms. Very well thought out and has some great classic like ""RED"". This CD really shows the many styles of this talented performer"
1,Who are they kidding?,"Pretentious, self-indulgent, and a waste of money! Buy a different translation. I was more enlightened by Dr. Seuss's ""Horton hears a Who"". Too bad there isn't a zero star option."
2,the tao that can be spoken of is not the true tao...,credible words are not eloquenteloquent words are not crediblethe wise are not eruditethe erudite are not wise
1,This is a great book !,"I love this translation, but it is quite different from other translations I own. The commentary is dense and slow reading, but it is very profound. This book can be used to stretch your mind. They seem to be saying that instead of existence consisting of fixed identities ""being"", it would be more useful to recognize things as being in a state of becoming."
1,Utter Drivel,"The authors have no concept whatsoever about the beauty and simplicity of this document.Instead they use their academic doublespeak to try and intellectualize ""The Way"".I highly recommend that THEY read Tolle's ""Power of Now"".This book is stomuch-turning to anyone seeking a path to enlightenment."
5,"A Literate, and Thoughtful Mystery","This book was a wonderful surprise. I had not been aware of Elizabeth Ironside (the nom de plume for Lady Catherine Manning), until I read a recommendation for this book. I took a chance and ordered it. This is one of the most literate of British mysteries. At times, the writing took my breath away. It is rare to find this kind of prose, and I ordered a second book by this author. I was not disappointed. To read Death in the Garden, is to read the finest descriptive writing available today. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I gave the book to a friend, and she called me to rave about the writing. It is that good!"
5,Beautifully written,"Death in the Garden by Elizabeth Ironside is worth reading twice – or even more. It is not a traditional ""English Cozy"" although it takes place in England. The characters are finely drawn, and the atmosphere comes through beautifully. Although I realized by whose hand the deed was done before the end, I was afraid for a while that the protagonist, Helena, would be faced with ambiguity that her lawyer mind could not accept. I was mistaken, and even the subplot had a convincing air. If the book could be said to have a moral (and such a beautiful book often does) I would say the following: Sometimes in our decision making we say to ourselves, ""What is the worst that can happen?"" Well, sometimes the worst is beyond what one imagines."
4,An English Mystery,"Keep your dictionary at hand when reading this. The story is constructed in several parts and all of them use vocabulary which may be common in England, but is a bit arcane for most Americans. The characters all seem to have personal demons, but that just adds to the overall mystery. This is a British mystery, so is not bloody, violent, or creepy - just civilized story about a murder (if murder can ever be civilized)."
2,Stilted and Boring,"I thouht I'd like this book, what with all the good reviews and my love of English mysteries. But I found it stilted and boring. The concept was good: an investigation sixty-some years after her great-aunt died into whether or not she actually killed her husband, a charge for which she was acquitted. There were letters, interviews, even a diary/journal for clues. But the answer was so obvious and the writing so stilted, I found myself skipping through the pages just to confirm that that my first instincts as to who-dunnit were accurate. (They were.) There's no doubt the author, the wife of the British Ambassador to the United States, is a talented, intelligent woman. But the story was too drawn out, and the writing was pretentious, at least for me."
3,Death in the Garden,The reviews were great but I was disappointed. The story seemed to move awfully slow and I found myself having to go back and reread what I read yesterday. It wa good but disappointing. Interestingly different plot.
2,Death in a Garden,"Not a easy read. If you like UK reading and mysteries, you might enjoy.Skips around."
5,Amazing stuff.,"Have watched Amadeus many, many times. Finally sat down to watch this beautiful opera. It was magnificent. With our home theater to play it on, we were delighted."
1,this gun is... not good,i bought this gun in my imagination and it is crappy. it broke the 3rd cock i coked it! when i cocked it it got jammed and something broke inside the gun it s a bad gun.
4,Good for beginners,"I'm new to the didgeridoo, so I wanted to buy an inexpensive one before I began playing. After getting it, I was very pleased with my didgeridoo, it came nicely packaged, A mini CD, as well as a very good looking bag for your didgeridoo. The sound isn't very solid as other didgeridoos' but other than that, great value for the price!"
1,A total ripoff,"Digiridoo is a bent piece of PVC pipe with some paint on it. Carrying case is a cheap piece of fabric with no carrying strap. ""Instructional DVD"" comes on a mini CD that only older computers can play. When I asked the seller for a copy if the CD, they said they did not manufacture the product and could not help me. So I have a cheap piece of s*** PVC pipe and an instructional CD I cannot use.Totally way lame."
3,the cover-version of GINA T. - Tonight's So Cold (1991),CLAUDIA JUNG - Je t'aime mon amour 1994is justthe cover-version of GINA T. - Tonight's So Cold (inside my room) 1991
1,This Hub gives a bottleneck performance.,"After owning this hub for a few weeks I discovered the poor performance it really gives. I have came across more bottlenecks than I have ever anticipated. I called tech support for any type of solution but I was left on hold for over 2 hours. Having schedules to meet, I finally gave up on assistance. Not only is this product poor in performance, but also poor in service."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Sure, the hub works - I've had it in my home LAN for a year now. Surfing, and low-bandwidth streaming is fine for this teeny-tiny box.But note that when you saturate the LAN pipe - say, ftp'ing stuff, or with NetMeeting-type stuff - you WILL see collisions appear. TONS of collisions. The little red LED basically stays lit.Paying $50/month for the 300 Kbps @home cable connection, and seeing your transfer rate drop dramatically when you use a $30 hub (instead of a $60 switch) is penny-wise and pound-foolish.(Note that this is a fine hub - and these comments would apply to ANY hub, AFAIK).I'm happy with my 4 port switch, thank you very much."
5,LINKSYS HUB,"This devise was extremly easy to connect to my LAN, I was able to get all my PC's connected to the internet.I was able to share my Printer, Scanner and fax with out any trouble at all. I strongly reccomend this product."
4,Booker T. Washington and Industrial Education,"This work does an excellent job of describing how Washington did not really want ""vocational"" education, but instead ""industrial"" education, to educate blacks for a ""place"" and stifle dissent. It also does a good job of describing the ""softer"" discrimination philosophy of the North, and contextualizing the Northern industrialists, who saw industrial education as a way to pit blacks and immigrants against each other. An excellent discussion of black education, the fights of teacher training, and uplift."
3,Page Numbers?,Where are the page numbers? I'm attempting to use this book in a cite and cannot find them in any kindle version I have.
1,too predictable,I'm big fan of her books. But I didn't enjoy this particular book. The plot was too predictable. Characters too unbelievable. A woman sleeps with a man and become involved with him that she didn't even know what he does for a living Cmon. and by the end of the novel you still don't know what he does and she states it doesn't matter. Be for real.
3,It was okay,"It was a good book but not the usual pazaz that Jayne Ann Krentz has, I liked the horse world information so that was fun! I would buy it again, specially from Amazon!"
1,Microsoft is the pits,Don't buy this card if you have Microsoft ME. It is impossible to get a driver.
2,Bad Dongle,"I like the card a lot, but the dongle that it comes with is pretty bad...one of them broke within a couple months, and I had to return the whole card. I'm on my second one, and already the dongle has broken so that the activity lights do not function...I expect that sooner or later it will lose all functionality (again).What a shame because otherwise it's a good product."
3,Hard for 3 yr old,"This was the first PS2 game that I bought for my 3 year old and had hoped that this would be a good way to introduce the gaming concept to her. Well I was wrong, it really shot her confidence level after failing several times, we put the game up and stopped playing it. Mind you that this was her first time playing, and I thought that maybe it was a little early. Don't get me wrong I think that the game itself is set up pretty good, (will need Mom or Dad to help get started). She is 4 now, we recently played and she managed the controller a lot better but still got upset at the game as she didn't know where to head next. She tended to gravitate to the Mini games that are geared more for short term playing.Overall: The game is something that I plan to keep and offer her to play ever so often in hopes that she can master the use of the controller better!"
4,Cute children's and nature lovers' tale.,"A good story for kids and bird wathcers' of all ages. Brings out the best in the people of New York as well. No stories of greedy Wall Street investors or urban street crime (although I am a big fan of NYPD Blue and Law & Order!) May even by scientifically significant for naturalists and zoologists because it shows how animals that normally live only in rural habitats can adapt and even thrive with a lot of offspring in urban areas. This may be the future of all birds of prey. Living in cities, not being afraid of humans. If you're a fan of PBS Nature and scientific shows like it you will like this. The urban enviroment is a surprising new twist compared to other nature documentaries but it works. It does not show the struggle to keep the nest after the building management tried to get rid of it so it's outdated in that sense. Would have made a good children's feature film if it did."
2,Disappointed,I saw the original and expected this to be the same show - it was not as detailed and informative as the original. To me it was not worth the price.
5,amazing,"Totally amazing. This is worth every penny, especially if you manage to get the DVD. While I agree with the first poster that this album is excellent, I must disagree with their claim that it isn't new or innovative. Les Savy Fav definitely has a sound all their own.Also, reformat is great, read the liner notes."
5,Come now.,"I think that the person who gave five stars to Chris Isaak's Christmas album is right. Les Savy Fav is just another band that jumped on the recent new-wave revival bandwagon. Except they were so bad that they needed to get a head start, so they jumped on this bandwagon way back in 1996. The bandwagon was just an unassembled pile of lumber at this point and all of the members of Les Savy Fav got splinters in their feet. Some guy in a band twenty-five years ago got a splinter stuck in his hand. Lars Sarvy Fav be a bunch of copycat frauds!For real, Les Savy Fav is a very fun band. They write consistently good songs and I encourage you to give them a listen. They are genuine, talented and intelligent men who throw a splendid party at their live shows. One time, I put ""Inches"" in my portable CD player and its sheer intensity gave me the power to ride my bike thirty miles to my grandmother's house in the city. Sweat Descends is my favorite song."
5,Excellent,"In my own opinion, this is Les Savy Fav's highest quality release. This compilation contains LSF's most excellent tracks. My personal favorites were jammed into the center of the tracklist. They include the Carly Simon reference heavy ""One Way Widow,"" and the original versions of ""Reprobates Resume"" and ""No Sleeves."" I thought both were much better on their latest album, ""Go Forth,"" but they are still highly credible here. The live videos on the DVD capture Les Savy Fav's intense live energy very well. I would've like to have seen more DVD material, because the music videos look like they were on a heavy budget, but I'm perfectly content seeing ""Who Rocks the Party"" live."
1,This book knows nothing,"Whoever these authors are, they know very little about the real west, especially ranching and cowboys and trail drives. I ordered it hoping it would be a reference, but since they know so little about cowboys and trail drives and horses, how can the other parts of the book be accurate??? The section on horse breaking was laughable, cowboys usually did not ride broncs to prove anything, they were too busy. They rode bucking horses to train them. Also, most loved the life, it wasn't that they were bored. They were too busy, and today they are still too busy, to get bored. Their horse breeds, ie, appaloosa, (a grey and black spotted horse and an Arabian, (a white or black desert horse,) are insults to every horse owner.What bothers me is that this book actually got PUBLISHED. Where were their editors????This book is an insult to all who live and work and write about the west as it really was and is.this rates a -5 stars.Cynthia J. Vannoy-Rhoades writer."
5,Great book!,"I've been living at home almost a year. This book was funny, smart and easy to connect to. I quickly recognized myself in the first few pages. I give this book the highest recommendation. The author clearly knows what it's like to be in the situation and the advice is right on target."
5,Coulnd't have done without it,"I had to move home three months ago to help my dad after (...) divorce to my step mom. I left my job, my friends, and moved to a new city. My friend had read about this (...) and gave it to me as a present when I moved home. I read it cover to cover and it really made me feel better to know that other people were going through (...) same thing. I especially liked (...) section about dealing with single parents, cuz it's so true what she writes about. I'm taking Furman's advice and setting a move out date so my Dad doesn't get too dependant on me living at home. Thanks."
1,"Card quit, lackluster support","This card worked wonderfully for a few months--not an error, good performance, very versatile. However, a few weeks ago it stopped working, could not be formatted, and became a worthless piece of plastic and metal. The SanDisk website offered very little help, and their e-mail support team never replied to my e-mails. Next time, I'll remember not to buy SanDisk."
3,"Outdated, but solid memory device","The SmartMedia Memory Cards are among the older of the portable storage technology devices. I continue to use one because my digital camera requires one. The drawbacks of the SmartMedia technology is that it is a very static format which leads to slow writing times and no variables speeds to the card. Don't curse the card for those failings, though. It is an older format. Newer devices are incorporating the more flexible Secure Digital (SD) and x-D Picture Cards. However, the SmartMedia format still holds its own in preserving the quality of the data being stored. Its design does not allow for any versions larger than the 128 MB variety, but it provides competent performance and is relatively inexpensive. That still makes the SmartMedia a viable memory source."
1,SanDisk SDSM-64-A10 SmartMedia 64 MB,This one is just like the one I had and it worked great until my carelessness caused a breakage. It is usable over and over with no trouble.
1,don't look for a good copy of this movie here !,"16 x 9 my butt ! this is nothing more then another ploy to have scammers take our hard earned dollars for a really crappy copy of this supposedly public domain film .stay with the vci copy as bad as it is , is still better then this over priced garbage !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,My little girl loves it!,"I am waiting for this to come out for sale soon. I rented it at Blockbuster recently. I have a 1 1/2 old girl and she loves this game. It took her no time to understand she can control the characters. I couldn't believe how easily she played the game. One of four buttons is for each character, she can choose which one she wants to be. Then she goes through Telletubby land, playing games and talking to other Tubbies. This game is great for any kid one year to four. She screams as we drive by Blockbuster nowadays. She loves this game"
3,Hated It!,"I have never seen the Teletubbies in any adventure this boring. My 5 year old was bored with it within 10-15 minutes. I think it's ""back to the drawing board"" for this one!!!"
3,Mixed feelings,"I am thoroughly unimpressed with the things that you are allowed to do with the Teletubby characters in this game. However, my 2-year-old son loves Teletubbies, and he doesn't care that the graphics are grainy and there's not that many activities. His favorite ones are to make tubby toast pop out from the toaster, the train, and finding friends behind the trees. He has noticed that he can't walk to the place where the Teletubbies sleep, and even adults have trouble leaving an activity. I really wish they would put out a better Teletubbies game than this one, but in the meantime, this is it folks."
3,A so-so kind of game,"If you have a child who loves the Teletubbies, BUY THIS GAME! However, it is difficult to stop doing the activites. However this is a good game for 4-"
4,Is this a joke? Save your $$.,"I have the PC version and the PS2 version, they are the same. Both are confusing, difficult to navigate, and very, very slow moving. As popular as these Teletubbies are, one would think someone would have put a bit more effort into designing these programs. Total waste of time and money."
1,NOT THE TELETUBBIES!!!,"What kind of game is this? Oh sure, I would TOTALLY get it if it were like, shoot the teletubbies, or something, but it's not. What is so educational about the teletubbies anyway? All they do is go around and say EH-OH! EH-OH! EH-OH! What the hell does that mean? And what's up with that sun? it's like thier dictator or something!! MY POINT: FEAR THE TELETUBBIES! SHOOT ANY ONE YOU SEE! TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE THEM EXTINCT!!!"
3,Good and a half,"Gulliver was Darryl Hall's, of Hall and Oates, first band. This self titled album came out on Electra in the very late 1960s.This is mostly straightforward rock. Well composed songs that have vague soul tinged, organs and light fuzz guitar--typical production of the era.Nothing here stands out but this is a solid rock album"
1,Ultra Slow Compact Flash PCMCIA adapter,"Transfer rates were around 1Mb per second - too slow for good video playback. I don't understand why SanDisk would offer a slow 16 bit PCMCIA (Type I) card that you could never take advantage of Ultra or Extreme compact flash memory? If you want to transfer large files to or from compact flash memory, purchase the 32 bit PCMCIA (Type II) adapter made by Viking InterWorks. With the Viking adapter, a 6 GB of iTunes folder was moved in about 5 minutes (~20Mb/sec)) to a 16Gb Extreme III compact flash card."
4,PC card adapter purchase,"I received my PC card adapter in perfect condition, took me a little while to get but atleast I've got it. Thanks to amazon"
1,This card reader makes computers unusable!,"I have tried this card reader with two different computers and it made both of them unusable during the transfer time. In addition, it took an hour an a half to trasfer 4 GB of data. There is nothing wrong with the CF cards, because I've used a different cards readers and it transfered just fine!"
2,"It works, but it is SUPER SLOW!","I bought this reader for my laptop since it didn't have USB 2.0.But to tell you the truth, I think this device is a little slower than USB 1.0! I am going to buy the Lexar 32Bit card and see if that improves the download speed, because this reader is so slow.It took me about 45min to download 2GB of photos from my Extreme III card. That is unacceptable."
4,"Good Product, could be better","The card works great and I have used it a lot for consolidating photos from memory cards. I store the adapter right in the machine. The only issue, which is not a big one, is that one cannot remove the CF card without removing the adapter each time the card is changed. It would be much more convienent if the card could be slipped in and out without removing the adapter.Other than that, it works very well and beats carrying a USB reader separate."
2,"Great Massager, Not So Good Brush","My cat sheds a ton, and somehow this doesn't seem to pick much of anything up. I really trust the kong name so I was dissappointed in that aspect, but the soft pointy edges provide my cat a back scratch/massage she truly loves. Worth a buy for something that will make your cat happier, not worth it for brushing purposes."
5,Bette Shines,"I used to put this CD in on repeat and leave it in for hours and listen to it over and over. Pretty much all of the songs are that listenable. My favorites are ""Bottomless,"" ""To Deserve You,"" ""The Last Time,"" and ""To Comfort You."" Everything from upbeat, bouncy sounds to low, melancholy to make give your emotions a work out. One of her best albums ever!"
3,"Good album, but...","While certainly not the best album ever recorded by Bette Midler, it's still a good one and still does it for me years later. Some of the songs are forgettable, but songs like In This Life, It's Too Late and I Know This Town stick in your brain for years.This would get 4 stars if not for the fact that the mp3 album download has an incorrect track. To Deserve You is NOT the original album version from the CD and heard in the amazon preview, but some incredibly bad dance remix instead. Be warned if you like that song. I kind of do, so it's quite annoying."
5,FIVE STARS,"GOD i could't go on enough about how Divine this album is .Ilove it .once you hear it youll love it and soon be recomending this to your friends .Each song is filled with powerful emotions .I tell you ""to deserve you "" is adictive .this album is full of soul power it speakes to you . I love Bette I'am a die hard fan and this album has every element of our darling Bette in it one can Imagin.Iam lestin to it now and I can't even explain in words how it makes me feal. Almost like love .exciting, powerful imaginative,.OH AND if you play the CELLO ""the last time has a beautiful cello part . please buy this album youll love it,buy it and play it loud!you can't help but sing aloud with it"
3,sings beautifully but it's not 1 I can listen 2 from trk1-11,"I love and adore Bette Midler but this one isn't cutting it for me. When I listen to this cd, I cannot listen to all of it. It is too 'run of the mill' all the way through. Meaning, basically it's the same style throughout the entire album (which I view as vocal country). All nice tracks but it's not like Bathhouse Betty or even Bette-with those 2 cds, there are a variety of styles of music on one disc. I enjoy ""As Dreams Go By"", and ""I Believe In You"" but all in all I give it a 3."
1,Ick!,"This cd has got to be the low point of Bette Midler's recording career. Everyone of these ballads is dull, dull, dull, without a bit of the emotional impact of ""Millworker"" or ""All I Need to Know"" or even ""The Rose"". Where is The Divine Miss M's flashy personality? It's no where on this lifeless cd."
5,Wow!! She's still got it!!,"I first heard the song ""In this Life"" during the closing moments of the last episode of ""Another World"". I bawled. What a voice. I wish I could sing like that."
2,Bette's #2 Craziest Album,"Bette Midler is an artist of song. She infuses her vocals with spirit, pizazz, and drama.But sometimes she delves into pure melodrama. Such is this album. I love melodrama, and this album is good for a listen or two for the absurdity of it, but it's not exactly fun to listen to and sing along with, like ""Beaches"" or ""Bette Midler"" or ""The Divine Miss M"" or ""For the Boys"" or ""The Rosemary Clooney Songbook.""I vote this as her second craziest album right after ""Bathhouse Betty"" because this album you can get through without skipping any songs because your ears are bleeding (I'm, of course, referring to that shouty/insane ""I'm Beautiful, Dammit"" song. Weirdest. Worst.).Overall, not a bad album, but not a great deal of fun."
1,Terrible,"I bought this pool because of the canopy, I wanted my daughter to be able to play in the pool but have a little shade. The canopy ended up being a huge disappointment. The three ""palm trees"" do not hold the canopy up, they bend over, no matter how much air you put into them so the canopy doesn't stay on. It is a terrible product."
1,I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing!,"Our little wading pool sprung a leak and since we are experiencing record high temperatures, we headed out to buy a new pool. I like the idea of this one because of the sun canopy and the train effect (my kids love sprinklers!)However, this pool is a total piece of junk. We used an electric infalter and found that it is impossible to inflate the pool to the point that it can support the canopy. I offered to hold it up so that my kids could play, but when we turned on the water feature, the whole thing collapsed because the top does not disperse water properly.Now my small children are afraid to go near it because it collapses on to them. With the high cost of shipping, it isn't worth it to send this thing back. $20 lost, lesson learned."
1,Not as pictured,"We bought this pool for our one-year old specifically because I liked the canopy and rain effect. Unfortunately, no matter what we did, we couldn't get the canopy to stay on top (the ""tree trunks"" simply couldn't hold the weight). We never actually made it to trying to use the rain effect since the canopy ended up laying haphazardly next to the pool itself. Save yourself some money and just buy a plain pool because that is all you will be getting.Also, the pool is not as large as it seems from the photo. It's probably large enough for two small children, but no more than that."
1,Don't bother with this,"I purchased a Banzai Jungle Cruise Canopy Pool, and right out of the box it must have been ripped. It will not hold air in the top ring, and thuswe are not able to use it. I have searched the ring for a hole, but it must be very small and in a seam, since I can't find it after a number of exhaustive searches. I called the Banzai customer service number regarding this problem. They must have many complaints, since I am perpetually on hold every time I call. I also have emailed them through their website, and also direct emails, but have not heard back. So, it was a $[...] waste of money. I will never buy anything from Banzai again. Oh yes, and the picture on the box was misleading. You can't find that many kids in it."
2,"Canopy won't stay up, don't buy it for that feature","This was an impulse buy at Walmart and I wish I had looked it up first. If I had seen these reviews I would never had purchased it. The canopy is a neat concept, but it starts leaning over the second you put the ""leaves"" on top and forget about attaching the hose once you do that the canopy falls right over. It is actually downright dangerous - when I turned my back on the kids to turn the water on, I then turned back around to find canopy on top of my daughter and son. I wouldn't purchase it again and would be leary of any other Banzaii products that have ""water features"" on such a small product."
3,Canopy water feature stinks BUT good for sunblock,"I got this last week and my kids LOVE it. It's bigger than a baby pool, yet not too big to dump and refil often.The canopy is great for blocking out the sun, that's why I bought it, and when the sun moves, you can teather it to the side and it works that way as well.Unfortunately, I could not get the canopy to stay on when trying to attach the hose (tried pumping more air, tried releasing air), I even tried just dumping a tiny little bucket of water in the top and it still fell over!"
2,canopy doesnt work,my mother brought this for $15 and i would say it is worth about that i for sure wouldnt pay the $50. the canopy doesnt work it lasted for an hour then went down and wont go up again. really shoty construction. so if u are buying this because of the canopy DONT but if you want a nice size little pool i would still say dont buy this bc my twins who are 2 are comfortable in it but anymore would be very over crowded. save ur $50 and spend it on something that actually works as advertised
3,"Good concept, but too bad it doesn't work","Dear daughter got this for her birthday from relatives. It's a cute concept but I can't get the canopy to stay on the pool. The ""trunks"" don't hold the canopy up, it keeps falling no matter which way I try to put it on. I even kept putting more air into the trunks hoping that it would hold and no deal...nada, nothing. I only rated this with 3 stars because it's a cute concept for a pool...should have actually been lower than that because of the problems with it."
2,AUTOGENIC CRISIS,"As everyone who pratices magick knows it is surely the precarious funambulatory way, but in no way did I expect what happened to me. for three weeks I practised the techniques reccommended by Mumford and then castastrophe! working on temperature control my temperature did change, it reached boiling point, i started to panic while realising i better call an ambulance but i never made it to the phone. I passed out to awaken three hours later dizzy and dry retching. I do not recommend this book to anyone. I have started a chatline on the net and have found two cases with similar symptoms . We are petitioning to get this book banned. As for the below review from Jonathan D we strongly urge you to cease using these techniques."
2,I didn't like it,I regret purchasing this package. It made me feel quite foolish when I got it. I will give the author credit in that his magic is in getting anyone to buy this stuff in the first place. I gave him the two stars for being a good con man.
1,A dreadful waste of time,"By page 51, I figured out the entire plot without any effort. Dreadful. Don't waste your time!"
1,Did I miss something!?,"From the first page, I felt the book was badly written and even more badly edited. So I read some more. My opinion didn't change and the story got so dumb that finally I did something I hardly ever do - I stopped reading it.I really wanted to enjoy it but with this one, don't waste your time. The main character is annoying, the writing sloppy and the ending beyond believable."
1,"Oops, I Should Not Have.......",Should not have purchased this book. Not interesting. Gave it away as a Christmas present to someone I didn't like.
1,Amateurish first attempt,"When I recently moved my library, I came across this unread book tucked away behind others. I decided to start it one rainy afternoon, and what a waste of time that was! The plot is flimsy and the characters simplistic and unbelievableI guess this book just proves that there is not at least one book in everyone."
2,"Not who dunnit, but who cares?",Anyone with half a brain will figure out who the killer is at least half way through the book. The ending is clumsy and requires the reader to make large leaps out of reality/believability. Of course every murderer confesses everything into a hidden tape recorder while waiting for you to pass out! Doesn't every working mother have a live in nanny/housekeeper who tends to your children while you are out solving murders and your husband is out of town?The book seemed promising in the beginning....what woman does not have at least one friend that she abandoned or was abandoned by. The author should have stuck to that relationship theme instead of writing a second rate Nancy Drew mystery. The characters are 2 dimensional and rarely spark the reader to invest any passion into the plot resolution.
3,Mixed bag,"Not the easiest read. It can be a little confusing at times, however, there are some real gems within if you're patient."
3,"Disappointing, and not well put together","The cookbook is falling apart at the spine. Not glued very well.The photos are o.k, but it's an odd mix of recipes. After looking through it twice and reading multiple recipes, I did not mark a single one for my ""must cook soon"" list."
3,Pretty good game but not as good as Malarky.,"Really like this game, but very similar to Malarky. Malarky is the king of this genre of games. We play Malarky weekly with our friends and now have teams from the neighborhood playing against each other."
5,The best board game I've ever played,"This game is a blast. I've never written an online review before, but I felt like I needed to for Wise and Otherwise. I've had my copy for a few years now, and have probably played about forty games on it. (Each game takes at least an hour or two and is most fun with four to six people with roughly similar verbal skills / creative abilities, so it takes a little effort to get a game going.) It's definitely a little ""slow"" when you start out playing, but once everyone in the game has played once or twice and understands how to play, it becomes incredibly fun. You don't necessarily have to be a ""word"" person to like it, or even think of yourself as creative, though imagination helps. A little like Balderdash... but with the potential to be way more fun."
4,Anticipating,Have not had an occasion to give it a good try as it seems to be more fun with a number ofpeople involved. It is beautifully crafted. In future I am sure we will get lots of enjoymentas it was highly recommended.
3,HOW COOL!,"hello people.well, I played this game at the Caspian Sea in between tanning and eating hot dogs. It's great for multi-racial groups. I played with a half black/half mexican person, a chinese person, a texan, a jew, and an australian! and me, a north carolinian! buy this today!"
4,Wise and Otherwise,"I enjoyed playing this game,but at first it was hard to understand the instructions and ways of the game.Once you learn the ways of the game though it is VERY enjoyable. The sayings are ones I've never heard of so I leard these odd saying from all different cultures(example:long live the salt shaker,yes that IS ONE OF THE SAYINGS!)"
5,I love this game!,"I have lots of board games, and this is by far one of my favorites. I play it a lot with my freinds, and we have so much fun. We all end up laughing. This game is a lot like Balderdash, so if you like that game, you'll love this one. I highly reccomend it."
2,Gets old quickly,This game is fun for about two plays but get old quickly. The sayings and proverbs are very obscure and family and friends enjoy making up crap for only so long. For the $40 price tag pass and get two other more entertaining games!
3,"Great game, but once was called Balderdash","This game is great, but I recall a similar game using the same basic concept...make up your own definition and have people vote on it. If it were under $20, maybe the game would be worth it. I think any game like this should be much cheaper...you can get a book and do the some thing for a fourth of the price. END"
3,Ok game,"I bought this game to play at family holidays. It just wasn't that fun to my family. Some of the proverbs were dumb and meaningless. I also bought ""Wits and Wagers"" game at the same time. It was a riot! The whole family loved this game. I recommend Wits and Wagers over Wise and Otherwise."
2,I beg to differ with other reviewers.,"Impressed by other reviews I bought this game for several members of my family. We played it in a group of six on Christmas day and were extremely disappointed. The proverbs, assuming they are real, are not only obscure, but often rather meaningless. For example, one was (roughly) ""Every hill....has a slope."" By the time you have gone around a few times you know that no one is likely to know or guess the right answer. Because of this, the part of the game where others guess whether someone else has the right answer doesn't work--you know they are going to be wrong. This was a great idea but very badly executed."
4,Fun across generations,"We have played this game with our family ranging in age from 9-13, adults 40+. We have enjoyed it. The best feature is that it has no ""trivial"" knowledge requirements, therefore it is not threatening to people who are hesitant to play games in mixed groups of people. We played with grandparents, friends of the family and all enjoyed the time together.Players must invent endings for beginning words of wisdom from many different places in the world. My children have invented many strategies for convincing others to vote for their wise sayings to the point of making up words that sound legitimate for specific areas...sneaky little progeny!"
3,"Good game. Similar to Malarky, but not as good.","This is a good family game. My family enjoyed this game, however, we have more fun playing Malarky...I would recommend it."
5,our favorite game,"This game is about the best game we've ever encountered and definitely one of the funniest. In fact, it's pretty much impossible to play this game without a lot of laughing. No matter what mix of people are playing the results are always highly entertaining and surprising. The great and fun thing about it is that the real old sayings in the game are really unpredictable, so the endings people make up are also unpredictable. There can be a bunch of funny ones or a mix of funny and ""wise"" ones, and you never know what will get the votes. The game inspires a lot of joking around, which makes it very social. It's getting a lot of play in our house, but it's one you'll never get tired of. A superior game, sure to be a classic."
5,Weird Old Sayings = Laughs and Fun,"I purchased this game for my wife for mother's day (I know, it's a weird gift). It sat for awhile before we ever played it, but when we did, boy, did we have some fun. The object of the game is to come up with believable sounding endings to strange old proverbs from around the world. There are hundreds of sayings, so the game never gets old. The idea is to bluff the other players into believing your ending to the saying is the real one. The more creative you are the better you'll do--most of the time. Some of these sayings are so strange that you've got to be thinking on that level to succeed. The hardest thing to do is keep a straight face when the players sayings are read aloud by the reader. I've burst out laughing frequently which gives a lot away and hurts my results. I still giggle at my mother-in-law's made up ending to the old Russian saying ""September cabbage....March slaw."""
4,Brain Food,"The trick with this game is to make sure you come up with plausible but less than obvious meanings for the many sayings that are contained in the cards. This is a fun challenge for anyone who thinks they're creative or good with words.A lot of the sayings seem like the sort of thing someone somewhere may have said once or twice rather than being a well-known phrase, but that doesn't seem to matter. It means that the sticklers or trivia buffs don't have any advantage over the rest of us!There is no luck involved, which is a refreshing change (no dice conspiracies to spoil people's fun), and the game length is good. An average game takes less than an hour.It works across generations (I've played with my inlaws) as well as amongst peers. On the whole, definitely a good game to have in your collection."
3,I think this can be better with more people,"When I first saw this game on Amazon, I just knew I had to buy it! I had the chance to do so, and shared it with some friends who tend to have large gatherings at home and enjoy playing box games.We had a good time with the game, there's no disputing that. However, there were only 3 of us playing, and I really think it would have been more fun had there been 6 or even more people entering into the lunacy :)As I sit here writing this, I just remembered the times that 2 of us actually came up with the same answer -- the funniest part was trying to figure out if one of us actually guessed right,and, well, I suppose you had to be there!Anyway, the game IS fun, and you will learn lots of things you can't possibly have known before, but again, my suggestion is that you really try this as a group exercise. The more the merrier :D"
5,Reese's Skinless Boneless Sardines,"Reese Skinless and Boneless Sardines in Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 10)These skinless boneless sardines are great. We used to buy them at the store, but have not been able to find them except on the Internet. The flavor is mild and we get the ones packed in olive oil. If you like sardines, you will love these."
3,Sardines,"Very good value, and very consistant product in size. Unfortunately, I found them a little tough for my taste.Charles"
2,Reese's Sardines,the sardines are sort of bland in taste. I had to mix them with hot sauce to give them some flavor. Even better with jalapenos. Did like the fact there were no bones.
2,REESE SKINLESS AND BONELESS SARDINES,"LOOK LIKE SLICE FISH, NOT LIKE SARDINES I KNOW AND EATEN ALL MY LIFE, THIS MAY BE THE NEW KIND OF SARDINES."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I am a massive Beatles fan and own a wide variety of Beatles books. I purchased this book via the Internet and was appalled at the content. The 'fictional tale' listed in the description boils down to pornography. In addition to the sexual content and abundant use of profanity, the book is ripe with grammatical errors and misspelled words. This book contains several sophomoric stabs at poetry and a story about the author's journey to a toy show in search of Beatles memorabilia.The only thing that this book has going for it is its cover design. The glasses and guitar are self-explanatory. The wrench is reminiscent of Lennon's 1965 book, A Spaniard in the Works."
5,good kid show,my three year old loves thomas and this product arrived just in time for his holidays dispite the extra parcels that were prob causing delays. i am happy with this purchas!
1,doesn't work,i got this item after a week and it doesn't even work. i have tried 3 sets of battieries and nothin nada zip.
1,wrong item than what I thought it was going to be,The shipping was quick and well packaged. But it was not what I thought it was going to be. I will probably give to to someone who can use it.
1,NOT SanDisk !,"The item you will get is NOT made by SanDisk . It is a cheap DaneElec brand CF-Card. The quality is very questionable. Seller claims that this card is made by ""Scan Disk"". Yes, ""Scan Disk"". Don't be cheated by MTA!Sincerely, TA1DF"
2,All flash is not created equal,"SanDisk flash is some of the slowest flash on the market. I strongly suggest purchasing a better brand such as Viking. The only thing SanDisk has going for it is price, but for a few dollars more you can do a lot better."
2,How slow can you go?,"I bought this 128 meg card for my nikon coolpix 990 figuring to boost up my number of pictures I take from an 80 meg lexar card. I heard sandisk was an overall good company so I decided to try it. Once I ran out of room on my 80 meg lexar card, I popped in my new 128 sandisk card and started to take pictures. Boy was I surprised when it took the camera forever to take another picture. I usually have my digital camera in a mode to take many pictures once I hold down the button but it took over twice as long to snap those pictures. Also in play mode when looking at the pictures I took it seemed like the images were pixelated for a second then became more detailed. Oh well I guess this memory card will go into my mp3 player instead."
5,Weber Regulator,I was having a hard time finding tanks that had the old style regulator connections and this solved the problem. Was very easy to change and had the grill going in less than 15 minutes.
1,Not as pictured!,This replacement part is not a genuine Weber part - as pictured and described! Go to your local hardware store and buy a generic and save yourself the shipping & cost for a premimum part!
4,Weber regulator,"The Weber regulators seem to last longer than the no-name brands but the price is about twice as much. For as long as they last, I don't mind paying the extra money for better quality."
5,Easy to install - just as described,This was easy to install. Couldn't find genuine Weber parts locally - only generic - so it was good to find this part at a fair price.
5,Great Plugs for the Money,I've been using these in all of my two-stroke dirt bikes for the last 15 years or so and they just work.
2,Let the witch hunt BEGIN!,"The book itself was fine. It was a well executed children's story. However, the story itself - citizens of a small village don't accept Eevil Weevil because he's messy so they try to get him to change. When that doesn't work they run him out of town! What a lesson to teach children. ""You had better be like US, or you won't be accepted."" Phah!"
4,good book,I bought this book for my daughter and it was exactly what she needed. She is in college and the teacher requested this book but we could only find it on amazon.
3,oh well,The most boring thing out there. I don't favor bureaucratic stuff really. But I needed it for my class. And I guess it's good to have an understanding about the good quality classroom arrangement. But I plan to sell it back after school is over!
3,Door closer,I would not use it for a normal front or back door. Appears to be made for light weight doors.
5,Perfect for ceramic-glass top stoves,"This griddle is perfect for any stove, INCLUDING ceramic-glass top stoves. While most griddles say they can be used on all stoves, most do not have a truely flat bottom that is needed for ceramic cooktops. The bottom of this griddle is totally flat, thick and smooth. I do not have joined burners, but the griddle absorbs and radiates heat so well, I can cook on the middle section that is not directly above a burner."
2,Works well when new. POOR reliability...,"I've used this for 8 months or so on my glass-top stove. When it was new, and for many months, it was great.Then it started to go bad. The cooking surface has 'bubbled up' (best word I can come up with) in several places, and it is no longer smooth. It is not food collected, it is the coating coming up.I never cook above 2 on my cooktop (out of 10), so it is not due to overheating. All my other cookware is much older and handles those settings without issue.I wish I could still find the ""Cooks Club"" brand. It's been the best I've owned so far, but the store that sold it went out of business."
5,Fit perfectly,"Even though it is a little pricey for a fuel tank, it is high quality - also comes with cap. Fit perfectly."
3,A 1997 Classic,"It's unfortunate that the publisher hasn't updated this 1997 classic, but, outdated as it is, this book still has much to teach. Kent describes the three main types of relationships a technical writer can have to a company: employee (which he calls ""captive""), contractor, and consultant. And he discusses the skills you would need if you wanted to move from one type to another.I do disagree with his derogatory tone toward employees. As a consultant, I work for and with employees and I feel that they deserve respectful consideration. Even though this book is most often referenced by employees who are considering becoming independent, I (a small business owner) still get marketing ideas when I pick it up.I wouldn't use this as my only resource, and don't take his 1997 tax advice! However, if you're looking for a shot of enthusiasm and a creative approach to consulting, and you have the skills and nerves of steal that it takes to succeed, this book still has lots of relevant advice."
2,Not in step with today's market.,"It is my opinion that this book presents an overly optimistic view of contract technical writing. First of all, contract tech writing is limited to certain geographic areas. If you live in a nice, quiet little burg, you will have a hard time locating work. In other words, be prepared to move to the big city to find work. Telecommuting is not a reality for most of us. Maybe in the future, but not now! Second of all, everyone and their uncle is trying to get into the profession. Kent fails to mention that a technical ""knowledge base"" is necessary in order to convince those who have the power to hire you. Just having an English degree won't get you in the door. Thirdly, much of the material is just a rehash from the earlier edition.Buy the book if you must, but keep your reality reading glasses close at hand.Roger Peterson"
1,Not helpful at all for a dyslexic student,The pen does not read as you scan. It stores a line of text and then reads it back. It doesn't save time on reading assignments. It takes about as long to scan and play as it does to read something few times.If you want to scan text into your PC so you can use a text-to-speech package you must get a flash upgrade and the cable. The $269.00 version of the pen is not the upgraded pen that interfaces with a PC.It may be useful to students with other disabilities but it's not an enabling technology for dyslexic students at all.
5,Very good book,"This is quite an interesting book for true crime fans. It gives the basic details of quite a few crimes. The author seems to have made an effort to include crimes from all over the world.However, he did not include the deaths of Bobby Fuller and Valerie Percy, nor the disappearance of Richard Cox."
4,"not 5 stars, but damn good --","if you like the cars, you should own this album -- don't expect an extension of television, cuz it's not, but a damn fine recording nonetheless --"
5,Substantial amount,I use is this mount to support a Samson meteor mic. It works great. I would definitely buy this again. The mounting is designed to work on any diameter microphone stand. It has good positive adjustments even with a heavy mic on the end.
2,Great with one important problem,"I initially liked this screen very much: it's bright and contrasty and didn't take much time to set up. However, after a few weeks of hanging, it developed very visible wavy creases across the screen. They went diagonally from the pull handle at the bottom to the upper corners. When viewing a uniformly colored image, like the red Netflix loading screen or a blue sky, the creases are strongly visible and distracting. This is not an issue of mis-handling; it's a design flaw. All I did with the screen was hang it on my wall, pull it down, and leave it for three weeks.The other aspects of this screen are fine for the price, but because of this one flaw I don't think it's worth owning."
4,Worth buying,"Plot: it's about a prince who needs to find a wife in order to create heirs. If he doesn't find a woman, he loses his inheritance to the kingdom. There's s a couple singing and dancing numbers which are a bad waste of lip-sync time. However, it's getting four stars for the various nude scenes throughout the movie. Setting: Medieval setting, king's castle, and mostly at the ""shoe"" house. The Clincher: Complete nudity of actresses is shown."
1,Fairy Tales Review,Just wanted to mention this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I thought it might be funny but I was wrong. Bad comedy and bad acting. One funny moment in the whole movie. Not worth your time. Purchased for party. $10 is too much for this. I would have to be paid to watch this again. Avoid at all costs. Thanks.
2,"Basic Stuff, Not Much More","What I was expecting from this DVD was a lot of the techniques and detailed development in ""punk rock"" drums. I was looking for setup techniques, many different popular fills used by big artists, and other crucial elements of ""punk rock."" What I got was a beginner tutorial of the basic beats in ""punk rock"" and not that much more. The beginner tutorials take up most of it going from fast and slow just like the previous reviewer mentioned."
2,K-Tel does west-coast punk,"Man, there are some classic songs here for sure - But what a rip-off - Less than 30 minutes of music here on a CD fer crapsakes - So why didn'cha include the great B-sides from these 45's? (like Black Randy's ""Loner with a Boner"" & ""Sperm Bank Baby"") - Oh yeah, then you woulda hadda buy the rights to those songs, too, cutting into the profits you'd make on this collection... Yeah, whatever, my friend burned me a copy of this so it's not like I hadda pay for it..."
4,Arrived in very good condition. The vender responded directly to my questions.,"The content is not such as to like or dislike, It is fascinating and I believe there isa very important truth in the foundational principal of Theomatics. But I do notwant to judge any further until I really spend time with this."
1,An Illusion,"Before you are taken in by the ideas presented by this writer, please visit his web site: Angelfall.com and see where Theomatics has led Del Washburn. This book is a prime example of the old adage: A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."
1,FIND YOURSELF,"There is no secret! You have been told all things! If it's a secret to you,it's because you haven't entered the narrow gate,However,not all true Judeans know it.Know this, if you knew, you wouldn't preach it,for in a very short period of time you would be silenced,by those who claim obedience of faith. If you have been chosen before the foundation of the world keep searching,for the LORD rewards the seeker with himself and only the invisible things are eternal.God's best keep secret has not been revealed to Del Washburn as he claims for himself."
1,Based on Theomatics GOD must changes HIS THEOLOGY,"Theomatics doesn't support anyones interpretation of the Hebrew or Greek text,but rather fosters it's own new interpretation with added edificatious opinions in symbolic generalizations and to satans delight,no final judgement.If you have nothing better to do,than play with numbers that don't add up,you'll love this book.However if you believe the numbers should add up in support of the text,I recommend E.W. Bullingers,Numbers in Scripture,written some 90yrs.ago,so theomatics isn't new and you'll save money."
4,Standard knob?,I found that the knobs did not slip over the standard Radio Shack volume controll I had used. I had to drill them out to fit.
1,"FAKE, FAKE, FAKE!!!!!",This DvD is the pirated version of Brenda Strong's Yoga 4 Fertility. The current DVD version is the one with Brenda in pink top and blue pants. Shame on you Amazon.
2,"Very difficult, no modifications for non-experts","The yoga routine in this DVD has a very high level of difficulty. You would already need to be a super-flexible yogini to be able to perform most of the moves. Brenda Strong very rarely suggests modifications, and she sounds critical of those who can't do the poses as perfectly as she can. For example, she will say ""if your hamstrings are so inflexible that you can't so-and-so."" They only show Brenda doing the poses, rather than a range of people. I much prefer the Monica Morrell video, because Monica seems to be more of an expert in this area, the poses are much more doable, and it shows a few different women doing the poses."
3,"Difficult, even for someone who regularly practices yoga","I tried to use this DVD at least 3 times a week when I first bought it. I have been practicing yoga for over a year; I wanted to add something else to my routine to increase my chances for conceiving. However, I found a couple of the poses to be so painful for me, that I became discouraged from doing the practice. As one other reviewer noted, there are no modifications for a novice. Not as relaxing as my weekly practice with an actual instructor... but I will try to stay with it."
3,Thirty Days in May: The Indy 500,"This book was written after the 1971 Indianapolis 500. The book is sometimes hard to follow and jumps around a little bit. The photographs are not as sharp as some of the newer books but technology has come a long way since 1971. Still, if you can find a relatively undamaged copy of this book, you should buy it."
5,Excellent condition,"I was very impressed with the timing of the product delivery. Also, it arrived in excellent condition; looked new to me. Thank you!"
3,Paperbook not the same size as the hardcover,I was disappointed since I own a hardcover copy for yrs.but this soft cover is smaller in size and print thanthe original hardcover. for me the print size is toosmall. I will have to give it away.i would have preferred if they gave out the book sizeand the print size (showed an actual example of printsize) before I bought it.
5,crucial,"I love this book! It has so helped my prayer life. I now know how to stand on the Word and promises, how to pray with confidence."
5,Prayers That Avail Much 25th Commemorative Gift Edition,I truly enjoyed this book so much I gave it as a gift to my prayer partners.
5,Book review - Prayers that Avail Much,Great service and prompt at that! The book is beautiful and in excellent condition. I would recommend the seller highly.Norma Rudametkin
3,It's okay,"I chose a 3 star rating because the book is okay. I got the Kindle edition and am glad that I did not spend more on a physical book. It gave me ideas for how I might want to pray, or think about and that is good. The variety of prayers was a lot, but not quite what I was looking for. I don't do prayers in groups (and there is a whole section on that). I was also a little surprised not to find a whole section on mental health and addictions in this day and age."
5,A Must Have,"I have multiple copies. The time and effort put into this book is amazing. For those who struggle to pray or want to search specific topics, get this book, then buy copies to give as gifts."
5,Blessed by this edition,"I was first introduced to this authour's Prayers that Avail Much by my mother, Orine Jones . It was at least 10years ago and I just read over a few of the prayers. Approximately 4-5 years ago as a much more mature christain,I invested in one of the new editions and now own 5 personal copies. This 3in 1 volume , Teens , Mothers, and Women's editions. The latest edition which has sincerely blessed me as a new business owner as well as an employee of a very large corporation is the Workplace edition. I am also thankful to have blessed many people with their on personal copies and often their lives have never been the same. God is awesome and has used Germaine Copeland to minister in the area of our prayer lives. Teaching how to pray the word of God effectively."
1,A little disappointed,Once again this product has a limited list of topics regarding personal prayers. It might have only one prayer for a particular topic if any st all.I will not be buying anymore from this series. I should have just bought one first to try it out.Suzukisue
4,"Book: Prayers That Avail Much, 25th Anniversary Gift Edition","I researched this book before purchasing it from Amazon.com. A friend of mine received this book as a gift. I was not disappointed when my book arrived. This book of prayers is a great tool and asset to have in your home. No matter what you are going through or what type of situation you may be experiencing, this book, Prayers that Avail Much, 25th Anniversary Commemorative Gift Edition will have a prayer that you can pray with authority and affirmation. This book of prayers will increase your prayer life, teach you how to pray, and help you to become victorious. You will be blessed."
5,Excellent prayer tool,This book has taught me how to pray the word of God for every situation. It is filled with many prayers and scripture references.
5,Essential Tool,"I can't recommend this prayer book highly enough. The references alone are worth the purchase, not to mention the powerful prayers. Initially I received this book as a gift after borrowing my mother's copy. I have since purchased at least two additional copies to share with others and have received the same excited responses.This prayer book is inspirational but not condemning. It is uplifting and encouraging and truly full of the gospel word of Jesus Christ.A must-have if you: 1) don't know what or how to pray to be heard 2) need some refreshment in your prayer life.It's an AWESOME tool!! I highly recommend it for everyone."
3,No valid table of contents for Kindle iPhone app users,"I love this book and bought it in the Kindle format so I could have it with me. However, after purchasing it, I found that that the ""interactive"" table of contents does not work with the Kindle iPhone app. When first looking for the table of contents it said ""Table of Contents (Not available for this title)"". By going to the beginning and then hitting the back button I did eventually find the table of contents. It is not interactive though. It is straight text and has no links to the book text. This is a reference book and a usable table of contents is a necessity. I am wondering if all the Kindle books are going to have these interactive table of contents that won't work with the app. If so, a warning should be included with the book so that us iPhone app users don't waste our money."
3,no contents page!,"I own this paperback, but I wanted the convenience of having it on my kindle. Unfortunately, there isn't a contents page in the kindle version. This isn't the kind of book you read straight through, there must be a contents page. In the hardcopy the contents page is over 8 pgs long! This is a huge disappointment!"
3,Ok but NOT what we ordred,"This is what we ordered, however we received a different type of Memory Card instead. The other item we ordered was NOT correct either. I contacted the seller, but they NEVER responded back. Time will tell if this works as well or not."
5,Cheaper than Sony and just as good,"I've had my one of these for over 18 months now and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.No crashes, no corruptions all data saved and recovered just fine.Thumbs up as is it cheaper than Sony but officialy licensed."
1,How would I know when I haven't received it!!,I ordered an 8MB Memory card for Play Station 2 and cannot find out when it will be shipped. I have tried everything. I placed this order on Dec. 1. When I ordered it it said that it shipped within 1-2 business days. There is conflicting information about shipment on this item. Can you help?
3,It's memory fo god's sake!,"What's to say? It's a memory card for the Playstation2. It works well, does the job, and is a horroble yellow color. I had a hell of a time finding one of these (that's why I paid 50 bucks for one) and I find that a little nasty of Sony, for whatever reason. They should support their products a little better. The size is much larger than the original Playstation memory cards, and load times are a little faster, but shouldn't it be? For 400 bucks (system, memory card, xtra controller, game) I would say so. Is this a great product? Who knows, it's just necessary."
3,Kind of a dud,Hey What your paying for is what u get. The first week i had this it lost ALL of my data everything! ALl of my GTA: VICE CITY AND RE: CODE VERONICA X DOWN THE DRAIN! Only buy this if ur looking to save a buck and don't mind the risk.
5,Works perfectly,"I've had this memory card for *FIVE* years now and I've had no problem with it at all. I bought it because it was much cheaper than the Sony one and I've had no problems with this at all, which makes me suspicious of all the other reviews saying that the data gets corrupted after a couple of months. Maybe Nyko had some duds among all these memory cards, but I know for a fact that they *do* work and last a very very long time otherwise."
3,Corrupted Data Week After Purchase,"I purchased this card a while ago and it gave me problems on week 2.I fixed the problems reformating it using GameShark's GameSaves manager.Still this kept me from booting into SOCOM 3 and Burnout 3 (by weird coincidence their both ""3"" games. hehe)"
5,One of the best compilations of Jelly's early works,"There are a few compilation CDs of Jelly's first recordings in the early 20s before the Hot Peppers, when he started off as a pianist in Chicago. A lot of these songs are gems and of course, this is one of the few compilations where the sound is not remastered or messed with much, but kept original. It contains a lot of scratch since it was transferred directly from old records, but the sound of the piano is crisp and clean under the scratch, unlike other compilations that dull the piano sound down while trying to remove the scratch sound. For as old as it is, the music has still been preserved well and is a huge piece of jazz history."
5,Great recordings,"If you like the stuff that came after, most likely the victor recordings made between 1926 and 1930, these solo piano recordings offer so much insight into how jelly must have originally heard them at the piano. There's something beautiful about hearing these songs stripped down, before many would be heard on recordings divided into separate instrumental parts. Great stuff."
2,Poorer quality than most Pampered Chef products,"While I've been happy with other Pampered Chef products, there are better pastry blenders out there.The problem with this one is the tine blades bend, so it's hard to cut butter mixtures into fine pieces.The stainless steel is nice, there have been no problems with rusting, although the handle isn't particularly comfortable to use (and I have small hands).Long ago I owned another garage-sale pastry blender that didn't have this problem. Unfortunately, the red paint on the old wooden handle flaked off so I got rid of it. Wish I would have sanded down the handle and kept it now!Pampered Chef needs to work on this design. Their products aren't inexpensive so it makes me think twice about buying other products from the company, especially since it seems it would be a hassle to try to return anything. That's unfortunate, because I'm sure the people who count on income from Pampered Chef are having a hard enough time booking parties in the current economy."
2,pampered chef pastry blender,"I am on my second pastry blender, the first one broke within one month of purchase. Yes it is guaranteed but when you have to send it back to the company at your expense which costs almost the price of the article to start with this defeats the purpose of the guarantee. Yes they sent me another and it is also broke. I don't think I will return it as there are a lot better pastry blenders out there. I will say that I thought it did a decent job when it wasn't broke. The one I buy at garage sales for 25 cents do just as good a job and will last 5 to 10 years. I will not be purchasing anything else from Pampered Chef as I see there guarantee as useless, if the price of the article was reasonable to start with then that would make a difference."
1,Poor Quality,"Within a week of using these lights, the purple bulbs stopped working. I am sure it is just poor quality in the way it was produced. This review has nothing to do with the seller of the item. They completed the order as promised."
1,don't waste your time,"the picture showed pockets in the front (no pockets) the cover fit the back of the seat but not the front, total waste of time all the reviews I have read are bad about this seat cover, I am having a difficult time finding a damn seat cover"
5,over stocked,"I really have not tried these yet, still trying to figure out how I ended up ording 3 sets of scissors."
3,America Balkanized,This is a slightly Pat Buchanan or even Jared Tayloresque right wingy study of population trends along racial lines in America that predicts America will become racially divided by regions or will fall into out and out warfare similar to what occured in the Balkan region of Europe.
5,Superb,Wow! What a great CD from J.Geils. This is how they started out and should have stuck to it for the most part. Most of the songs are worth listening to. Great price also from Amazon.
4,Early days of J. Geils Band,"This is an early recording of the J.Geils Band. As such it still reflects the raw unpolished power the band had back in the day. It is old school and wicked. I loved this album when I first heard it, but later, at the release of their live album ""Full House"" I found out what the band was really all about. This album pales compared to what they do live. For example, ""Crusin For Love"" is not nearly as hard hitting in a studio version such as this is. ""Hard Driving Man"" is slowed to the point of not living up to it's name. But, perhaps the biggest disappointment is ""Serves You Right to Suffer"", the Howlin' Wolf masterpiece that litterally screams with forlorn rage. Yet, rendered here with a sensitivity that glosses over the power felt in the ""Full House"" live version. If you are looking for the roots of this group, this is an album to have. Otherwise, if you want the real deal of the ""bad boys"" from Boston, then get their ""Full House"" album."
5,one of their best,"Great studio debut by a band more known for their live recordings. Great cover of ""Homework"" and ""Serves You Right to Suffer."" But my favorite has to be ""Cruising For A Love"" with the line: ""I ain't no mathematician baby, but I'd sure like to count on you."" Good sound on this reissue, too."
4,awesome,The speakers look great w/ or w/o grills very nice awesome price. Haven't hooked em up yet but expect good sound.Ok hooked up the speakers .... I have them hooked up to a head unit putting 50 watts into each and its good but going to hook them up to a 160watt amp and make them hit louder and harder very nice speakers I always play them loud and no distortion at high volume .... great speakers
5,Amazing,The sliver plastic cover came broke but I installed them With out the cover and they have been amazing over the past year and are still going strong.
5,Excellent product,I bought this memory card and used it on my Intel mp3 player and it works perfectly. Great bargain.
5,"fast shipping and free bundle, great deal!","i ordered a sd card, some business give it with a sd card reader and a usb cable, so its great, this sd card work perfectly in my 3 cellphones"
4,Very useful,"This book has a large variety of garage, shed, barn and stable plans. I'm not a do-it-yourself type. I need garage blueprints to hand to my contractor and the town's inspector. I've seen all the plan books. This has the best buildings for my small-town location."
2,I was immediately disappointed when I opened this book.,"I was expecting something with substance. The book wasn't much more than an advertising brochure for construction plans, hardware and related texts. If you're serious about building a barn or backbuilding, I strongly recommend that you look to another source."
3,"Arrived quickly, book in perfect shape, but content not what I had in mind","Examples of barns a bit redundant. A few styles reworked again and again. Not as much variety as I had in mind. Very good list of resources and connections for specific needs, however."
2,rather dated book,"this book has a lot of good points, but needs to be updated fortoday's horse keeping. The barns are mostly quite old and wouldnot be built today"
1,OUT OF STOCK,"YOU DID NOT SEND ME THIS BOOK. THIS IS THE ONE I REALLY WANTED. I GOT A NOTICE TELLING ME IT WAS OUT OF STOCK.INSTEAD, WHEN I WAS TRYING TO ORDER THIS, YOUR CROSS-SELLING SYSTEM SOLD ME ON A TWO FOR ONE DEAL....THE BOOK I ACTUALLY GOT WAS OKAY, GOOD FOR GENERAL CONSTRUCTION KNOWLEDGE BUT NOT THE CONCEPT/DESIGN INFO I WAS LOOKING FOR."
1,Very good evaluation book,This book needs to be studies very carefully! It is an excellent demonstration of the effects on environmental boundary conditions for the native people in lage areas. The documentation is a great and substantial contribution to political analysis work.
1,cheap,I was dissapointed with these earrings. They look and feel cheap (which they were!) I was hoping for better quality as I read the reviews before purchasing them. I never wear them because they are so thin and cheap looking
3,Toothpicks,"The quality of the wood used in the toothpicks is not high. The flavor is cinnamon, but if you're expecting the cinnamon toothpicks from the 70's you will be disappointed."
2,don't get it,"this must be some kind of nostalgia trip for people. I love cinnamon, but these things have hardly any taste....gum is a lot better!"
2,Could be better!,These are not sturdy enough to use and I thought the cinnamon flavor was kind of weak.
3,Good but beware of shipping costs,These toothpicks are great and everything you would expect them to be! Just beware of shipping! i was charged $5.88 for shipping which is almost as much as the toothpicks themselves.
4,Different but still good,"As a kid growing up in the 70's, I remember cinnamon toothpicks that were very skinny pieces of wood individually wrapped in paper and quite flavorful.These toothpicks are not the same as the ones I remember but are still quite good in their own right. These toothpicks are much thicker/sturdier and also hotter. They come in plastic containers of 75 each. Think of a short, stout toothpick crossed with a touch of Atomic Fireball, and that is what you are getting with these."
4,very good,"These brought back memories. They seem to be spicier than I remember, actually burned my lips. If you like hot and spicy, you will like these toothpicks."
2,Not the same as my previous order.,I'm not sure what happened to my latest order of cinnamon toothpicks that arrived yesterday. They don't have even one-quarter of the spice and bite I've come to expect. I taste the flavor of the wood more than the cinnamon. There must have been an error at the factory.
4,Taste-T-Picks,I used to buy them in packs at your local store when I was growing up. At 53 now it curves my smoking and helps freshen my breath as an added bonus
1,Weak flavor!!,This used to be the bomb back in the day...hot and flavorful. Now they are weak. And splintery!
3,Not like I remembered from my childhood,"I bought these for my brother for Christmas, because we loved Cinnamon toothpicks as kids. I remember the solid, round, quality wooden toothpicks, but I was surprised when these arrived and they are actually flat and pretty flimsy. I'm sure they still taste good (I can certainly smell them strongly!) and I'm sure my brother will appreciate them, but I'm wondering what happened to the nice solid toothpicks of my youth - maybe it was a different brand."
1,what a waste and no taste!!,"I loved these as a kid and couldn't wait to try again....WOW these are lousy! There is very little flavor and not remotely HOT. Even tried combining multiple picks, still no flavor. A previous review noted the ""splintering of the wood"", this is very true so becareful. Spitting out the wood is part of the joy, i guess. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,stale and nasty tasting,"The product was old and no good!! I gave the box to some kids and they even complained. What a waste of my money. The HOTLIX cinnamon tooth picks our much better, but they where out.Thank youtom Troglia"
3,gack,"I love the fact that each disk comes in it's own little secure case, but I had a terrible time trying to open the plastic package it came in. Don't grab this on your way out the door intending to take pictures of the kids' game or your best friend's wedding because you will need either a sharp knife or a box-cutter to get it open. After wrestling with mine for 10 minutes, trying to pry it open with a dinner knife and then attempting to cut open the sides and top with a pair of scissors, it finally occured to me to get a razor blade and carefully cut the disk out from the front of the package. There is some kind of four-page insert in the box (behind the disk) but by the time I finally freed the disk, I was in no mood to extricate the insert as well."
4,Geology and Bacteriology: A good combination,"Geomicrobiology: Interactions between Microbes and Minerals is a valuable reference for any geologist with limited biological background, and for any rock-deficient bacteriologist as well. I found this book to be easy to comprehend, while at the same time containing all relevant technical information. All in all, a great resource for rock lovers and bacteria buffs alike!"
4,"Remember the ""Rat Pack""","Being a big fan of the ""boys"" I recently purchased and really enjoyed the behind the scenes look at ""Ocean's 11"". The original is still the best. Today's poor copies...11, 12, and 13 don't come close to the original.This DVD is a must if you enjoy the original Rat Pack?!"
3,Just what a ratpack fan wants,"This is something I had been looking for a long time. Its just what a ""Ratpack"" fan wants. Lot of information on the personal life of the friends. It also in the end came out as a lesson in real friendship. The tecnical quality is not so good. To say the least. I wish it was better. That is the reason for my 3 stars."
4,Worked great.,"Worked great with my tread mill, the only drawback is the 6 MPH track seems more like 3 or 4 MPH. Great for people that like to walk, no running/jogging here."
2,Disappointing Mercer,"As a huge Johnny Mercer fan, I was looking forward to this outing with jazz players, but it's a strange mixed bag. No recording dates are given, but the quality of sound varies as do the instrumental accompaniments. The most satisfying tracks are the duets with Helen O'Connell (""Accentuate the Positive"" & Two of a Kind"") & oddly enough, Bobby Troup (""Jamboree Jones"") whose presence suggests that perhaps his piano and group are providing at least some, if not all of the backings. Mercer does not sing ""Moon River"" or ""Autumn Leaves"" leaving these lyrics to O'Connell alone. His solos here often seem tired and lackluster rather than just laid-back. There are much better versions of Mercer's solo tunes available - the originals on Capitol's ""Collector's Series"" for example. The Mosaic set referenced by another reviewer appears to be instrumental settings by Al Cohn - at least that's all I heard on Amazon's samples. But then, it's hard to have too much Johnny Mercer in any format!"
5,"""Darling"" is a Gem","William Tester's ""Darling"" is a gem of a novel, one of the most profound and audacious explorations of what constitutes the nature of love I've ever come across. Ostensibly the story of two farm brothers at war for the possession of a family cow, the book makes one question the nature of love -- any love -- and does so in precise, evocative and provocative ways. This is one of those gems you come across that no one's ever heard of, and everyone should have. I bought every copy I could find at the time I discovered it and sent them to friends. It's a personal favorite of mine, and I hope more people in the future discover it."
4,help me find kabobs,I just received my rotisserie. I have used it twice and really love it. Kabob rods didn't come with it and I can't find out where or how to buy some. If anyone knows I would love to hear from you.
4,Finding Parts,"I have been trying to find a site that has parts for my rotisserie. The foot on the right side is broken and I need to replace it. Maybe the bottom feet could be made of a more heat resistant plastic or metal. The oven is great other than this. If anyone can help me, leave a note"
2,Abysmal to clean,"Great for poultry et al but a real monster to clean - We do all our chicken in this but the back of it is dirty because it's always getting spattered with the juices and it is so hard to clean in there, although on the bumph that came with it it states that the heating elements are self cleaning - well that's as maybe but the blue cabinet behind the heating elements is so filthy I'm concerned it can't be cleaned and I'll have to chuck it out which would be a huge waste of money!"
1,Worthless,"The study in this book came about with a set of assumptions and prejudices that the author was determined to prove. The study group was taken from high school and a few of his college students, as these ""are the typical metalheads in age group."" I am 40, female and professional, quite outside the supposed standard metalhead description. The people I personally know who are into heavy metal music are near my age, both male and female, and all are professionals. Seems that blows the stereotype that this study is based on. Ill-informed and judgmental, this is a book that could have been written without bothering doing any case profiles, without listening to the music and without attending any concerts. Could be considered utterly worthless except for the laugh gotten from how wrong the book is. If it was possible to do so, I would give this book ""zero"" stars."
4,Great pianist,"Sultanov's playing is great, always great.I enjoy hearing his virtuosity and delicate attention to musical phrasing.I can in this performance hear him spinning new creative ideas while beingcompletely at ease with these large Concertos.Sadly the audio mixing is bad. It sounds as though the piano was not directly miked, ormiked only from a considerable distance. Thus, the piano is difficult to hear above the orchestra, and the audio in general is too quiet - requiring one to turn-up their stereo quite a bit.Too bad about the audio, as he was truly a musical gem in the piano world!"
2,Barely Worth $0.99,"If you like Dragnet, Adam 12 & other outdated cop shows then you'll like this; otherwise, steer clear!Lots of dames, Daddyos & a coincidental ending that you can see coming after the 2nd chapter.All this wrapped up in cheesy dialog with characters I could care less about.I only paid $0.99 when Amazon ran this on a daily deal & I still feel cheated."
2,The Mugger,This was the first time I've read anything from this author and I wasn't impressed and will probably not readone again. I didn't get connected to any of the characters and there seemed to be too many of them.
2,Katniss' thoughts,I found this book to be outdated in it's style and subject matter. I didn't even finish it. That's all I have to say about that. This book was too boring to waste my time reading it.
1,the mugger,a total waste of time. the story could have been told in 100 words or less and it would have been better.
2,Not up to his standards.,"This book was so boring I didn't even finish it. I like McBain, but this isn't up to his usual standards."
4,Good book,"This is a book that's a quick read and has good entertainment value. It isn't as convoluted as I would like and you know who the bad guy is before you've read very far, but it's worth reading."
4,Classic Cop Story-Love It,It was a very good short read. I love classic crime stories! I'm looking forward to more stories by McBain.
5,What a SHAME there is no more SWEET COUNTRY MUSIC like this anymore..,"Fantastic!! They do not make good country music like this anymore. I would'nt be surprised if this CD and music like it will disappear completely some day. Good music like this has been ""snowed under"" by tons of new, untalented and mostly forgetable ""so-called"" country music. I'm so happy to have this. My only wish is that they would put out some of his old albums onto CD as well. My first Johnny Duncan album had a song called... ""Aint She Something Else?"" on it. Conway Twitty later did a version and he had a minor hit with it. But I first heard Johnny Duncan's version and still remember it to this day. I would love to have that song on this collection. But I won't complain too much as I'm happy just to have all these great ones still available.Get it while you can....you'll love it!"
4,Smooth country,"Johnny Duncan just passed away a couple days ago, and it made me think about this wonderful CD. My first love is hard-core honky tonk, but Johnny's smooth '70s country sound is fantastic. My first taste of his music came a couple decades ago with ""Jo and the Cowboy""--a great song. Add ""Thinkin' 'Bout a Rendesvous (sp)"" and ""It Couldn't Have Been Any Better"" and ""Come a Little Bit Closer"" and you've got some amazing country songs. Sure, they're mellow, but sometimes that's just what a country fan needs."
2,"not his best, by far","Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best. The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best. The Man from St. Petersburg is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion."
3,man from St petersburg,Not what I thought it would be. rather draggy and boring. would not recommend to friends.
4,An easy Follett,"Easy to read, a very good beach book though it doesn't have the strength of ""The Pillars"" or some of his war novels. A nice unpredictable finish."
3,Not Follett's best.,"I'm a fan of Ken Follett's work & intend to read all his stuff. I have read 5 books so far. This was a disappointment, though. At first it seemed like nothing more than a historical novel bodice-buster, but then the plot did pick up. The main problem, though, was the character of Feliks. Follett wants to make him at least a little sympathetic, maybe a lot, but it didn't work for me. Feliks is a big, smelly, dirty, cruel, ruthless, coldblooded Communist assassin. The fact that he's good in the sack & glib with words does not compensate for his evil. And can Charlotte really be that stupid? Oh, well. They can't all be winners."
4,Great,"As always, a book of K. Follett which is brilliantly combined with history and facts and fiction. Fun to read"
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I read Eye of the Needle a long time ago and remember enjoying it. So when I saw this book in the library I thought it would be worth reading.Suspenseful? Maybe the last 5 pages or so. I really only finished the book to see how it ended.I found many of the characters actions to be preposterous, even in the setting of the novel. In the end I only really liked Walden. Charlotte turns out to be a ditz.I also didn't enjoy some of the preachiness of the novel, especially the suffragette issues."
2,Follett is better than this.,"This could have been a much better book. So much good raw material and fascinating history, as noted by other reviewers. But, also as noted by other reviewers, his plotlines are often too implausible. I can suspend belief to a certain degree, but all too often Follett comes up with plot turns that are so implausible that it spoils the story. Follet can do better than this."
1,stopped reading after 2 chapters,have read a novel by mr. Follett previously and thought it was pretty good. this book was not my kind of novel. It was so boring after about 20 pages I simply discarded it
3,interesting,"not my favourite Follett novel, took me a little while to get into it and care about the characters, and still didn't care for them like i have in his other books.however, still a very interesting and well written story."
3,Not my favorite Ken Follett,"It was well written and interesting to hear about the war from the perspective of a Russian resistance fighter. But I found him basically a terrorist and really didn't find any one of the characters sympathetic, except perhaps for the wealthy lord who we were not supposed to like."
3,Follett approaching his zenith,"This is one of his earlier efforts. Generally, his skills improved over his career. This book keeps your attention, is full of historical facts, but the ending is not all that realistic."
4,A true Follett novel,"Ken Follett has the ability to take a turning point in history and make it come alive in a work of fiction. In ""The Man from St. Petersburg"" he has done just this. Taking a slice of life of the British aristocracy and showing the conflicts that leads up to WWI. I will leave it to you to discover the who is the man from St Petersburg and what part of history he brings alive."
2,The Man from St. Petersberg,"The plot of the story had the potential for intrigue, all the elements were in place,but the story was clumsy and predictable. I did like the history unfolding prior to WWI and the integrating of the future leaders of Great Britian into the converstions."
5,The Man from St. Petersburg,"The Man From St. Petersburg is a wonderfully, excitng suspense novel with fast paced action and a gripping plot. Every character will draw you into their story. Even the villain is someone that you will relate to! This Follett novel is in the same genre' as Key to Rebecca, Jackdaws, Day of the Jackal etc. You will love it!"
4,Solid Job by Author,This is not a bad effort from the author but his recent books have been better. It sometimes seemed to me that the story line was moving away from the believable. The story did move very quickly and you can stay interested in the book for many hours at a time. The most fun I got out of the book was the descriptions of the time frame and the tradecraft used. If you are interested in reading some of his earlier works then I would suggest Triple or his best work Pillars of the Earth.
4,Engrossing read,"Ken Follett has done it again! The book is based in the early 1990's, the World War 1 as a backdrop. The protagonists are from Russia and England, two major players in the World War. Along with giving an interesting insight, into the politics carried out by leaders and influential people in a nation, which ultimately go on to determine the fate of the whole world, it delves deep into the psyches of the main players - common people with emotions and weaknesses not different from yours or mine. The best thing I liked about this book, is that the characters are so real.And there are no heroes or villains. You sympathise and empathise with each of the characters at various times as you read along. With the narration being of such a high quality, I wondered how Ken Follett would manage an ending which would do justice to the story so far. Ken Follett did not let me down.The ending could not have been better."
5,"An excellent book of romance, espionage and history","Ken Follet once again fulfilled my expectations of a good book. This was an excellently written novel about real characters and figures in history with whom we can relate. Feliks, the man from St Petersburg, comes to London to see to some ""business"" that could change history but ends in an unpredictable way. While he is in London, he meets up with Lady Walden, a woman from his past and learns something which changes his life...The question is: Will this change the course of history?"
4,Tough to get into at first...,"First of all I love Ken Follett. However, I have just recently just discovered him with his most recent books like Pillars of the Earth and Fall of Giants (which are also amazing). I was told by a patient that I must read this book, he was right. Although it took me a while to get into it (felt like the first 2 chapters went on forever), it was really worth it in the end. This dude likes making his stories back in the day of World Wars. With his combination of factual events and fictional main characters, it makes for a good read while learning at the same time!All in all...plow through the first chapter or so and you'll enjoy it."
3,Good description of England,"Novel had interesting characters and a lot of good information on England of the time. Some superb and hilarious excerpts from the London Times, particularly the one about the treatment of carriages."
4,Spy thriller set in the early 20th century.,"This spy novel is set ealier in time than most of the similar novels I have read. It makes it interesting from a historical point of view, but can be simplistic in its plot and situations at times.Almost an historical fiction novel rather than a spy thriller."
4,Deeply flawed characters,"Follett certainly has a gift for capturing the essence of the times. His depiction of both the surroundings and of the people is a delightful talent.The protagonist is given away by the title. Although he is quite wicked, you find yourself feeling for him, even wanting to like him. This hardened anarchist travels to England from Russia bent on killing a prince from his homeland. While in England, the prince lodges with an aristocratic family where negotiations are held concerning terms of territory of an anticipation of the looming First World War. Within this family there contains a twist, but you will need to read it.The characters are each with their own unique, debilitating faults. They are all sadly, very flawed."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"Prior to reading The Man From St. Petersburg, I read with great enjoyment other Follett novels--The Key to Rebecca, Eye of the Needle, and Pillars. But this one, while interesting historically, I found to be at times tedious and uninteresting. It's too bad, because the characters are complex and the story, events that led up to the first World War, is intriguing. But somehow, it missed conveying the excitement and thrills that one usually finds in Follett's novels. Some of the behavior of the main characters is really far-fetched, and sometimes the details in the story-telling became boring to read. Overall, it's not a bad book, but it just isn't up to the author's usual gripping style."
2,It could have been so much better!,"Although I read the book quickly, it became impossible to suspend disbelief. The actions of some of the characters simply made no sense... except to move the plot along. While the book has many twists, many were not plausable. The enjoyment of the book, therefore, was signficantly reduced as the actions of the characters (particularly the mother and daughter) became silly. It's too bad becasue Follett is a good writer and ""The Man from St. Petersburg"" had great potential. ""The Eye of the Needle"" was far superior - it easily passed the plausability test."
1,"Very,very disappointed.","I have waited to get my vcr. For the first time since I received this movie,I played it today. It is terrible. You can hardly see the picture. It is NOT the vcr because I put my other movies in and they play fine! I am SO disappointed,because I this is one of my very favorite movies. Thanks anyway....GRZ"
5,First Crooner?,Gene Austin was one of the first artist to use the crooner style of singing which couldn't have happened without amplified sound this is a nice selection of his work A VERY ENJOYABLE ALBUM
5,Anyone over 40,"Great product and a must for those who are 40 and up. i gave some to a 69 year old friend of mine because he loves to bike around the San Francisco area. He noticed less fatigue and less joint pain after riding. He also noticed that he now can eat wheat without any side effects. He just had his first burrito, burger and pizza in decades. He hasn't done anything different except take a teaspoon MSM with water twice a day."
2,description misleading,"The description says ""crystals"". However, if this is in fact MSM crystals, they are so tiny you would ned a microscope to se them. This is a fine powder.....not crystals. Othre than misleading description, it's a good product."
1,Carribbean Elegance,"I bought this as a Christmas gift. I chose the dealer because it was suppose to be new. It arrived with a tear in the cover and an ink blot in the bottom of at least 3/4 of the pages. I can't find a way to contact the supplier: Fulfillment Center155 N. Old Hill Rd.Fallbrook, Ca 92028There was no packing slip with it to contact them."
5,FABULOUS!,"I have owned this book for over a year and always thought it was an excellent book but wasn't inspired to write a review until just recently, when I received a new book I purchased called ""Caribbean Style"". This book, ""Caribbean Elegance"", is everything that the other book is not. I love this book! The photography is incredible, encompasing everything from the smallest furniture detail or accessory, to entire historical exteriors & interiors, and exquisite scenery!The text gives a detailed history of the settlers and islands, really giving you an understanding of how the various styles of West Indies architecture and furnishings came into being. It also distingushes the furnishings by their various European influences, such as Spanish, English or Dutch, among others. As an interior designer I found this book fascinating and educational. But even for someone who just has a love of the islands, the photography alone is worth the price of the book."
4,A tantalizing lesson in Caribbean furniture and history,"Michael Connors and Bruce Buck have given me a fun and educational experience in their creative endeavor ""Caribbean Elegance"". I hope to see more of each individual island's gift to its historical history provided by their craftsman and furniture makers. Especially fascinating were their fabulous Cuban ventures, which makes me feel they only scratched the surface leaving lots to encounter in future. This one is an asset to any coffee table collection!"
3,Moderately interesting,"This book had some interesting facts, but as an interior designer who was looking for inspirational pictures for room designs I thought it had moderate value."
1,I was one of Layachi's ex students,"Let me tell you something, unless you are muslim or a man Layachi will not like you (he displays anti semitic behaviour in class as well as he speaks in french and Arab with students so no one will understand him). His books are boring as well and his classes are worst. I am happy it is over. I don't care if he went to NYU... Big deal so did my grandfather."
1,Awful,"This is another one of those acdemic type of books that your professor forces you to read for class that is totally bad. The author seems to go no where with the point they are trying to make and it drones on and on until the end, when you finally realize you have gone no where reading this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Reads like a bad college textbook,"This book reads like a bad college textbook, I read selections from it for class and I must say I did not find it interesting at all."
5,Excellent book for advanced readers,"As one of Dr. Layachi's students- some 10 years ago- I find his book an excellent, analytical study on the complexities of the politics of north Africa and the current economic collapse.Let me add, Dr. Layachi was one of the best teachers that I had in NYU. His books are as serious and as thoughtful; not for C students.In person, I found him eloquent, focused and very knowledgeable on middle east issues with a bios or being apologatic towards Islam and Arab issues. This is the case for most M.E. professors regardless of their background in NYC in my opinion; I mean to say that a balance need to made for other views."
1,you have to be joking?,"This book reads so dry and boring, you are better off surfing the web for info on Africa then getting this book, this guy that wrote this is a joke. He knows NOTHING about africa."
4,Drop in installation,The bar and chain fit perfectly and were easy to install. The only drawback is that the chain seems to stretch excessively. I use the saw extensively and seem to be tightening the chain far to often. For use by the homeowner to trim and clear small areas it is ideal.
1,paying for a small backpack the price of a bigger one,My daughter cried when she saw the size of this backpack and she loved the design....if it would be bigger would be perfect!!! we had to return it and buy another one....hopefully we'll get lucky next time!!!
3,More information,"I liked this item, my only problem was that the item is to small. There was no size on this backpack and from the pic it looked a lot bigger. This item is good for a small child. I needed a backpack for an upcoming 3rd grader!!"
1,bad customer service,"The shipping was fast and that was appreciated. It was the only part of the experience that was appreciated however. The wrong product was sent - though afterward they claimed otherwise despite the fact that the description on the receipt didn't match the label on the item and when I contacted them for either an exchange or a refund I was treated as if I didn't have the simple intelligence to read either. Jenny was particularly rude and lacking in basic business etiquette in her emails. Needless to say, it was refund time because an exchange wouldn't be worth the hassle of dealing with this company. They still refused to admit their fault though the refund, along with a snide email, was given rather quickly once I returned the product. Five stars for speed but everything else was gutter level. Accessories are easy to find on the internet. I'd recommend finding a different company to order them from."
5,Suspenders work great and these are nice.,"As a kind of off-beat suggestion from a friend, I tried suspenders for their functionality. It is amazing how much more comfortable and functional they are than just a belt, but you soon figure out that the alligator clip variety want to fall off. So, I went the aggravation of putting a set of buttons on a pair of jeans - of all things - and these suspenders are great. They stay on, function quite well, and the delivery was prompt."
4,nice suspenders,"These Suspenders have worked out just fine for me so far. beware they are mens suspenders, so they are a bit long on me (a woman, who is 5'4""), but they are adjustable (of course) so it isn't too much of an issue. Just wish the gold bar came down in the middle in front insead of my shoulders, but not a big deal. They also have a thick band which is fun. I got the green ones, which are very accurate to being hunter green in color. all in all a nice buy."
2,not warm and fuzzy,One of the bears seemed a little scary for young children. Seemed like video taught kids more of how to be a brat than about sharing.
5,Daughter love,My 3 yo adores this updated classic. Theme song is required singing :). A classic that still teaches valuable lessons. Great pic too
4,Very good,My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this! Very colorful graphics and good stories for kids. I would recommend this.
2,Be careful! Same shows on multiple DVD titles!,"Make sure that you don't already own the Flower Power, Cuddly Bear Collection, Tell-tale tummy or Cheer here, there and everywhere because they are the same videos just broken up."
4,My 3 year old liked it,She set through the whole movie and I didn't mind watching it with her:) I thought it was going to be out of date but wasn't.
4,Great screen but quite a bit short!,"I suppose I was expecting something more like a teacher's projection screen rather than an HD ""shorty"". It ends up working out quite well but I would have thought that it would have been longer.The draw string and spring action is solid and getting it installed was a cinch. I'm happy I bought this one."
5,I was on Suspense,"This here, was my very first SVH book, and i enjoyed every moment of it! I was very sad, yet happy at the end. I started reading SVH this summer so I never knew anything about its plots. Now, in December 1998, I've read 16 SVHs and reading 1 SVU right now. I read some of the other's comments and I thought they were crazy to give this one a 1-star!!!!! I love SVH and this was just the way to start me off!"
3,TRIPLETS??,"This book was a little unrealistic, to say the least. I mean, how could one person look so much like another that he or she has other people totally fooled? That was the part I didn't understand. Margo really was insane to think that she could actually pull it off."
5,The best SVH book ever!,This book was amazing. I have been reading the series since it first started and was wonding how Francine Pascal would do book #100. It was a great book because it shows you that not everybody's life is perfect. A lot of things can go wrong
4,This book was very mysterious.,I thought that the book was a great book. I liked the way that Margo envied Elizabeth and her almost perfect life. You have to read the books A Night To Remember and thebooks with the numbers 95-100. This will help you understand the book The Evil Twin
2,Elizabeth and Jessica are in mortal danger!,"I can't say I thought this book was as great as everyone makes it out to be. I'm 14 and I was around 12 when I read it and even then I wasn't too impressed. Although you were in suspense some of the time, for most of it I was just wishing they'd get on with it. I didn't read the previous books in the mini - series because I didn't need to. This book told you all that had happened, so it didn't make me want to go out and buy the prequels. Sweet Valley High just isn't what it used to be. Every book is full of gloom and doom, and you can never believe Jessica when she says she's totally, madly and deeply in love with a guy. Her and Sam Woodruff were perfect, but of course Sam died. Now Jessica has a new love in every new mini - series. And Elizabeth is forever two - timing Todd. I'll give this book two stars for effort and some suspense, but I'm being generous. Come back, old Sweet Valley. The new type isn't half as good."
5,"a very good ""carmina"" at a budget price","This is a very good modern recording of the beloved""carmina burana"". The conducting is vigorous. The orchestra, chior and three soloists are excellent.Sumi jo is a delight- her ""in trutina"" and ""stetit puela"" are delicious."
1,Audio clips do not match the CD,"It seems clear that the associated MP3 clips of Mehta's Carmina Burana do not match with what must be on the CD. The clips seem to be a Scandinavian (maybe Danish) version by a group who call themselves Carmina Burana. It is fascinating in and of itself but it is out of place here, hence the 1 star rating."
3,Vague product description,"I do realise that the item title does say 3 x packs of 12 pencils, but the description also says something about there being ""72"" pencils to the box. Maybe fix this up, as there's clearly 36..... After shipping- not that great a value."
5,A pleasant surprise,"Having only read the hardcovers until this point, I was apprehensive about the comic strips even though I knew they were the genesis. I found this book, my first experience with the strips, to be a delight. I also found ideas that were developed further for the hardbacks. I heartily recommend this."
5,Great Headphones,"These headphones are very comfortable. The cord is great, it's very long and it's not plastic so you can bend it all which ways and it doesn't ruin the sound quality. Very nice headphones."
4,Good for the price,"I bought mine at Best Buy for a bit more than what it costs at amazon. They work good with my Ipod and the sound quality is a bit above average. I didnt really have a problem hearing and enjoying what i was listening. I wish however that the headphones were adjustable to fit at your own comfort level. It fits alright though. I dont run at night or anything so i dont know about the reflective neckband aspect.- Also its really easy for others to hear what your listening to. While not a major deal, but something to keep in mind. After some time of use whatever material the cord is made of starts to fray and come apart (just a tidbit).+ Sound, reasonable price and durable.So if your looking for decent priced headphones then these are good choice. I looked around for a bit for quality headphones for the ipod. Before not really finding anything that i liked. These are good for me for the time being. But i do plan on upgrading in the near future."
2,Not the most comfortable.,"I purchased these from another retailer and later returned them. They do look cool. However, the sound quality is only average, and they are uncomfortable if they don't fit your head just right. I'm about average when it comes to head sizes I guess and I found the neckband to be much too large so that it added no support and my ears did most of the work holding the set on my head. This became very uncomfortable after a short time. Also, the ears pieces did not set well over the ear to maximize what I was hearing. All in all, these headphones are only average and I believe MUCH better quality and comfort (and price) can be found with a pair of KOSS KSC75 headphones. Which I've also reviewed here at Amazon."
3,Sound is good. Feel is not.,"I like behind-the-head headphones. I like it when they are comfortable. These are comfortable for about the first 45 minutes, then they start making the top of my ears sore. Very sore. If you like good sound but painful ears, these headphones are for you."
5,david ackles-american gothic,"all ackles albums are must haves, but american gothic has EVERYTIME YOU FALL IN LOVE and ONE NIGHT STAND two of the most beautiful/bittersweet love songs ever. good luck finding FIVE AND DIME on cd. i got a sealed cutout at gohastings for 12.00 not too long ago, but i'm not selling, and i could get $100 easy for it."
5,The Boss?,"The first time I ever heard Bruce Springsteen (Greetings from Asbury Park), I immediately thought ""This guy stole his whole song writing style from David Ackles."" I hadn't listened to Ackles in a long time but that's the comparison I drew. Why David Ackles never made it big is beyond me but thank heaven he made this album."
5,to die for...,"Utterly wonderful. If Sinatra had only heard Love`s Enough, he would certainly have recorded it, had a huge hit, and earnt Mr Ackles some richly deserved dosh.This man was a genius. Don`t forget him. Along with Tims Hardin & Buckley he wrote & sang songs to die for."
4,Satin Ice Gumpaste,"I have used Satin Ice Gum paste in the past. I much prefer it over the other brands I have tried. it does not have the strong unpleasant smell like Wilton. It also has a better texture. This particular batch was slightly dry but after working it in my hands for awhile it was okay, but not perfect. It lost a star for being a bit dry."
4,Takes a little work,"this gum paste is a good product- like my fondant, I had to warm it to really work with it, but it got hard too fast and I couldn't work with it as well. but I'll keep trying. it does taste good however. when u warm it-it should only be about a hand full for about 2-3 seconds"
1,Satin gum paste,Have never liked gum paste or fondant but decided to try this for a special project. It rolled okay but the smell and taste were overbearingly strong with vanilla. Won't order it or any other gum paste product or fondant product again.
5,Lots of fun,We had lots of fun playing with this vodoo doll. It comes with white (good things) and black (bad things) pins. I used a white pin for win the lottery but so far nothing.
2,for fluent arabic speakers only,"I am just learning Arabic, particularly Egyptian.This book might be good (I can't tell) but you definitly must be an Arabic speaker to use this book and CD. If you are a beginner, skip this one and go to something else..."
4,Purchased for my 2.5 year old who aspires to be a rancher,"I purchased this for my little boy who dreams of following his daddy's footsteps and being a cattle rancher. We gave it to him for Christmas and it has moved to the top of the list of most played toys. It seems to be made sturdy, but with all the play I am a little concerned it may break one day. Who knows when that will be. Hopefully not for a VERY long time as we teach him to be careful with his toys while enjoying them."
3,A little more flimsy than expected.,"The corral is pretty good, just a little more flimsy than expected. My daughter plays with a similar corral at school, but that corral is sturdier than this one."
3,It's OK...,"I got this fence for display, not to play with. And it's durable enough except that it falls over and if your like me (read: a complete clutz) than if you step on it it will break. Also, its really short! Not very realistic at all...if it were a real fence, a horse could eaisly step over it. But anyhow its an ok fence if it being short is not a problem. Oh ya and if your not a clutz!"
4,great accessory for my 4 year old's horse collection,highly recommend this toy for any child who loves horses. We bought the Melissa and Doug mini horses along with this and my daughter has been playing with these non stop.
5,Great toy to work with Barn and animals for a 2 year old.,"Great toy, not as durable as a Homemade item I had bought for my son 27 years ago but will work fine for my grandson's farm."
2,The Little Wooden Fence,The gates and fences are hard to set up and they fall back down easily. Best for modeling not play.
2,Too big,"We bought this to go with the Breyer Showstopper horses that we bought our 4 year old. This is a very large corral -- too bi g for the Breyer horses. It towers over the horses. We bought this because it was on the ""people also bought"" list so we assumed they were sized to go together. To give you a sense, two 4 years can sit easily inside the corral."
3,"cute, but not terribly sturdy","Daughter really liked the corral. Unfortunately, one of the joints was faulty. We kept it since it is playable; she just has to be careful with it. I wouldn't recommend for a younger child."
5,Grandson loved it.,Just what I ordered. My Grandson loved keeping his animals in the large fence. I liked that it folded up for storing.
3,A Good Horse Has No Color,Difficult read; dry and more research paper-like. Not what I had expected. Took a while to finish because it didn't hold my interest for very long at a time
3,"Good book, but not gospel","While there is a lot of good info in this book, I think the author is somewhat liberal in what he considers ""fact"". While it's an easy read and well presented, I wouldn't take everything for complete truth."
3,honest info,"I like this book but I read it after I had already read 4 stroke performance tuning by the same author maybe thats why modern engine tuning seems to be just ok compared to 4 stroke performance tuning. What this book is, is very honest about actual results of replacing factory parts with aftermarket parts. After reading this book you also might be unwilling to spend $675 on aftermarket headers to get 3 more horsepower than the factory header."
3,Excellent griddle - terrrible handles,"Disperses heat evenly. Excellent cooking surface. I use it on my glass top stove. Unfortunately the handles look to be tack welded onto the sides. One of them broke loose after about a month of use. Since this griddle is so flat, I'm praying that it doesn't fall off completely - which would render it useless. This is an odd product because the physical cooking surface is one of the better ones on the market...but the handles are a joke - thus 3 stars."
3,Not what is pictured,"Ordered this because of the picture making it look like a Weber product. What is shown is not what was delivered. It is a hose, regulator, and the fitting in a cardboard box. It might work fine, but I expect to get what is pictured."
4,A Classic. How did I miss this one?,"The Big Chill is a great film. I've always known about it for its sound track (which is a great collection of classicR&B; and Rock & Roll). Some how I have missed seeing it and am really glad I finally watched.The story revolves around a group of college friends who reunite for a weekend after one of the peoplein their circle passes away. The themes are timeless, and the acting was authentic. At no point did I feelthat these characters are out of place. Each character deals with the loss in their own way, but they don'thave to do it alone.This film also reflects its time period. If this film were made today, I'm afraid it would be filled with cynical people,bickering amongst each other and passing blame. The Big Chill never devolves to that. This film presents agenuine group of friends, caring for each other in a time of need."
2,Not the best,"The music was great, and there are a few humorous parts. However, after some solid character building, the actual plot left me disappointed. I don't recommend it."
2,Cheaply Made,I only had it a week before one of the jewels fell out of the wing. The metal is already tarnishing too. Spend your money on a higher quality item.
5,Amazing resource for the classical music lover.,"My wife selected this book a few years back when we were first becoming interested in classical music. At every step, this wonderfully written, easy to read reference gave us some new bit of information on the people who have shaped Western music. The book is a collection of delightful essays, mostly biographies of the influential composers, as well as some background on various musical topics, such as sonata form, atonal music, and the like. I have read and re-read many a section, and am always amazed at how fresh they remain. Swafford's writing is sublime; I recommend this book (as well as his other works) highly."
3,Good. Well written--but...,"Duke Ellington, classical composer?! He need not become one regardless of Jan Swafford's attempt. I throughly enjoyed the book as to its biographies, its musical analysis. My only problem is not being an Anglo-American who has to wave a cultural flag and insist that classical music composers in the US and England have to compete with say, composers in France or Italy (like sports, I guess). I was suprised not to find Granados, Albéniz nor Falla mentioned at all. Then again Swafford goes through the Renaissance without any Italian composers."
4,Worth waiting for!!,"Ferdinand Preiss was one of the greatest, (if not the greatest) art deco bonze and ivory sculptors. His work sells for huge sums but despite this nobody has attempted to publish a book about him.....until now. Alberto Shayo has done a fine job. The book itself is a lavish production of full colour photographs of Ferdinands works. There is also a good biography of Preiss and his times (trying to operate as an artist in nazi Germany when not a party member).Shayo has carried out much research and really brings the artist to life. On the negative side, this is not a complete record of Preiss's works and the pieces are only given as illustrations, for example, there is little discussion of the different sculptures, variations or chronology. Anybody who is interested in art deco or naturalistic sculpture will really love this work."
1,HORRIBLE,I purchased this CD because I love this opera...I listened to it and it was not half bad...after all how bad can Verdi be?.... but then I just listened to a recording of a live performance of Il trovatore with Franco Corelli and Leontyne Price...and I will never listen to the Bocelli CD again..it is garbage...
5,A man with a beautiful voice and great talent,"I believed that there should be better reviews for this new cd. The younger generations, like myself, believe that his voice is beautiful. Because of Andrea Bocelli, I made a complete turnaround from rap to classical music. People around my age, I am 19, believe that his voice is more appealing than the three tenors. His voice seems to be more clearer and sounds more comforting than anyone else I have heard. This cd was a great classic that I will always cherish. Great work Andrea Bocelli."
1,Painfully bad,"I appreciate the fact that Bocelli is introducing a new generation to the world of opera, but his singing is NOT opera singing. He has a weak, unfocused, supremely unsupported tone. He doesn't seem to be very musical and the interpretation felt supremely uninspired. Not to mention that he could never be heard in an opera house over a Verdian orchestra without being miked. Opera singing is supposed to unamplified. Not to mention that singing the wrong repertoire incorrectly ruins even the most skilled singers. Eventually he'll kill what little voice he has. Opera has survived for hundreds of years for the most-part unchanged. To have Il trovatore given this popera treatment to make palatable to unaccustomed ears is painful to hear. As for the rest of the cast, it was over all, pretty lackluster. If you want a really good recording of this opera my vote goes for the Price/Corelli recording. That will knock your socks off."
2,"Bocelli--classical crossover, not opera!","Il Trovatore, being one of the three operas in the ever so popular Verdian trilogy, is one of my favorite operas ever. The magnificent orchestration combined with the poetry of the words merits it as one of the composer's most beloved works. However, this recording has bastardized Il Trovatore in every sense possible. Bocelli's light tenor voice butchered this interpretation of Manrico's role in the opera, and his ""Ah si, ben mio...di quella pira!"" didn't have the fiery passion exuded by a number of great opera tenors like Franco Corelli, Jose Cura, or Placido Domingo. Come on, Bocelli is a pop-classical tenor! He isn't suited for this kind of stuff! If you want a great Trovatore, buy the one with Karajan and Price or Callas...or even the one with Domingo and Mehta and Price Cossotto."
3,"I NEED MORE INFO, PLEASE","I think it would be helpful to know from reviewers of this recording (which I have not yet heard):- Are you a fan of Bocelli?- How many and which recordings of Trovatore do you have?- How many live performances of Trovatore have you been to?My answers are: not really but I like his pop stuff, I think 9-10 including Corelli, Del Monaco, Domingo, Pavarotti and di Steffano; four so far.So far Decca has made great recordings with Mr. Bocelli that would be better had he not been hired as the tenor. Case in point: the Verdi Requiem, which I only got because of Renee and Olga."
1,0 stars is more like it,"Bocelli may sound well in different repertory, but in Il Trovatore his singing is embarrassing. He has neither the voice nor the musicality for the role. Other singers are better, but not enough to save this performance. I don't normally leave bad reviews, but this time the performance was just too awful. Practically any other perfomance available is better than this."
2,Not what you would expect!,"I personally love Natioanl Geographic and its documentaries and I love animals. Otherwise, a very well done film, very well researched, but this one... is not quite just about the secret life of cats and their joyous way of being. It discusses the consequences of pets and their hunting on other species; it discusses pet owner responsibility and its impact on the environment.My main concern and complaint is that there should have been some labeling to warn the viewer about some less than kind/ rather cruel acts against cats. Not everyone, especially cat lovers, would want to see aborigens hunting cats!"
1,Typical Environmental Poppycock,"I bought this hoping that it would be much like the ""caressing the tiger"" doc they did earlier. WRONG!!! Come on; a dude with that wears dead cats on his hat!!!!! If that was a spotted owl, these schmucks would be out protesting, tying themselves to trees, and throwing blood on him. Typical hypocrisy on the part of ""naturalists."" If you have kids, DON'T GET THIS!!!! Get Cats: Caressing the Tiger. If you are a wacko that feels I have to keep my cat inside 24/7 so he don't kill mice and other wonderful household pests, then by all means, knock yourself out, pal!"
4,"Very nice followup to ""Caressing the Tiger""","An excellent cat documentary that follows up, but not directly, on National Geographic's wonderful ""Caressing the Tiger."" It has a younger feel than thier previous documentary and parents who are interested or have cats might want to review it to decide if their 4th grade and older children might like it."
4,Info still worthwhile...,"As stated above, if you go to the pro se website or to any clerk's office, there is a packet of forms available for handling your own divorce. Many legal aid-type offices also run clinics, if they don't provide representation outright, to assist with the forms and procedures.And just to clarify, the first edition of this book was 2003. It's the author that was issued in 1968.While the forms are readily available, I still think this book is good for laying out the issues that need to be considered and explaining the various procedures that will be required. I'd always recommend consulting a lawyer and not going solely by one of these guides, but I think this one is useful in laying the foundation to understand the process and to work more collaboratively with your lawyer and spouse (if possible)."
1,Do Not Order this Book,"I ordered this book three seperate times. All 3 times, the cover said ""File for Divorce in NY."" The first time I opened it, despite the cover, the contents were ""Landlord Tenant Law in NY."" The second time, again the cover was correct but the contents were ""File for Divorce in Pennsylvania."" I called to complain and was promised that they would physically check the book before shipping it to me. Clearly, they lied; the third time the cover was ""NY"" but the contents were again ""PA."" I have no idea if the book is helpful because I've never been able to read it. However, judging by the publishers' clear lack of Quality Assurance, I wouldn't waste my time trying to read this. I've already wasted more than enough time going back and forth with Amazon and going to the PO, etc. to mail this stupid thing back...THREE TIMES. Do yourself a favor and order another book."
2,Disappointment,I ordered this thinking it would work for teens. It is extremely small and would only be fun for small children. I was very disappointed.
3,They're ok,"These are very beautiful earrings. They're much smaller than I expected, not sure the measurements are correct on the description. I feel like I overpaid a bit, but I'm still happy with them for the most part"
1,Dissatisfied,"After waiting for a month for this to come, I opened the box and found it to be broken. Most pot racks are riveted together to make them stronger, but the cross pieces on this one are just welded in with a very small weld, which was broken in shipping. Fortunately, it was broken when I received it, rather than hanging it and having all of my pots and pans come crashing down and break my tile counter. This is obviously a cheap pot rack and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,A Rich Resource for the Storyteller,"Boose has pulled together a wonderful collection of stories from the oral tradition all five of the Scandinavian Countries and it is that that makes this collection unique and valuable. It combines the work of the likes of Anderson of Denmark, Asbjornsen of Norway and Djurklou of Sweden as well as other less prolific folklorists.Notation occurs in the Introduction in more narrative form which is a bit hard to access when you are interested in only one of the stories. I would have prefered a more accessable arrangement. The stories have been retained in oral lanquage and are in very tellable form. If you only want one book of tales from these countries or want a place to start this is clearly the book."
1,Watch out!,"I suspect the two positive reviewers are working for the company that makes this. :) I am writing this review after spending a full hour with a hacksaw trying to do the ""simple"" process of cutting into the Toyota part to retrieve the ball joints that are missing from this product. The ""little cut"" involves putting a hacksaw through a very solid steel ball joint, while carefully trying to avoid cutting the ball itself. After an hour of swearing, and a mildly injured thumb, I managed to get one of the struts installed. I haven't got the energy to try the second one. Save yourself the hassle and get a full replacement part that includes the ball joints."
3,Cute!,This was a pretty cute story. The Characters were good. Kindle edition has a bunch of typos and edits though.
4,A Sweet Story with Twists,"This was a sweet lesbian story with some twists for the characters. The story is based at the Siegel Institute for the exceptionally talented. The characters Nicola, Battle, Katrina, Isaac and Kevin are there for summer classes that let them learn more about their exceptional gifts. The main character Nicola is an artists and discovering that she is a lesbian. She falls in love with Battle, a beautiful blond dancer who is terrified of her feelings for Nic. Battle tries dating Kevin for awhile but she and Nic sort of end up back together. The story ends, in the all too typical fashion with young adult gay and lesbian stories, with the characters going on with their lives and there being a hint that they might continue their relationship at some point in the future."
2,Disappointing,"I had wanted to read this book for so long, for its good reviews. So it was surprising to me that when I started reading this book, I found myself skipping paragraphs, the book has too many unnecessary details. And it wasn't until i was 30% in the book, that the romance between Battle and Nic started.The characters weren't interesting, part of why I found it so hard to keep reading, they seemed unrealistic to me, so I couldn't get lost in the story. Maybe it was due to Sara Ryan's style of writing in this novel. Overall, I expected more of this novel and I was disappointed.I recommend this book to teenagers who are confused about their sexuality, and not to those who are looking for a romance novel."
2,kind of bad,"i read this book about a year ago so i can't remember all the details, but i remember it left me very disappointed. though it was written decently enough, with some amount of wit, (but that amount is pretty much standard i would say), i think some of the storyline just [was not good]. it was awfully cliched. things like, when the main character finds her girlfriend making out with some guy in an elevator, and then she says 'this is not what you think it is', or at least thats what i think she said though there's a good chance she didn't. but still. it wasn't interesting. it was awfully predictable and the only thing holding this up is that they're gay. if they were straight, i would go, wow. that just was stupid. all that happened was they took an overworked teenage love model and switched around the gender of one person."
2,Not Worth It,"I think that one of the things about our society is that nowadays, if you do so much as rate a book regarding homosexuals (or a movie, such as Brokeback Mountain)-- if you give it a bad rating, people will call you a homophobe. I mean, come on. A bad book is a bad book. This book is a bad book. It was extremely short. The characters were virtually unlikeable and one-dimensional. You knew what was going to happen right from the beginning. It really just wasn't worth my time."
1,Don't waste your time,"I couldn't even finish it. Not a single character was likable. If you want to read a good book, read Annie On My Mind."
4,Excellent YA debut,"Empress of the World is a touching coming-of-age story about friendship and love during a summer-long high school gifted and talented program. Nicola Lancaster makes and odd assortment of true friends. She's faced with her first crush on another girl, an awkward boy she tries to encourage to be more assertive, and a friend addicted to nicotine and caffeine who is playing with fire with a crush on a teacher. Throughout all this, Nicola's trying to determine whether archaeology is her dream career. Nicole grows a lot during the summer, learning about herself and how to relate to others. This is a great teen read with a good basic storyline. My one complaint is that some of the lesser characters are not well-developed, and some tangential plot lines seem to trail off."
2,Ugh,Really interesting characters - but nothing really happens with them. Author says one thing about a character and then portrays them as something different. Dialog is sketchy.
3,Iffy book,"Overall, an okay book, from my perspective it is definitely relateable BUT she used a bit too much fluff and I think she kind of went the safe route with this book. it goes a bit in depth but not too too much...Even though I am only 15 I think this is a bit child-ish for someone that is around my age."
2,Not close to Annie on My Mind,I read this book because it was a recommendation for people who enjoyed the novel 'Annie On My Mind'. I loved 'Annie'. The characters were interesting and it was a real love story.'Empress of the World' centers on dull as dirt Nic and a girl oddly named Battle. They don't seem to have any real chemistry and it's certainly not a story about love. Just my opinion.
3,Empress of the World,"This was a good read, but a lot of the characters actions weren't explained. I feel like this book is unfinished in a way...."
2,Not what I had hoped . . .,"This book wasn't as ""real"" or as engaging as I thought it'd be. The biggest surprise was how Underdeveloped and one dimensional the characters were. The writing is vague and a little too simple. The story overall was okay though, not the best, but just okay."
5,"Very, very good","I don't know what I can say about this book except for I loved it. I saw it in the library and picked it up and just started reading and couldn't stop until the end. I cried more then once. It got me started on this genre of books and I'm so glad that I picked it up. Sarah Ryans definatley has to write more stories. She made the characters defined enough for me, well, at least Nic was."
3,Amazon.com Book Review: Empress of the World,"If you're looking for a fun, frothy book to read during vacation, Empress of the World by Sara Ryan is a perfect fit. While it is a very light and catchy book, the characters still take us through the joys and difficulties of finding a new self. It focuses on the characters' problems, while still managing to be very funny a lot of the time, so it doesn't suffocate the reader in the conflict throughout the whole book. The humor in Empress of the World reminded me of the hilarious Louise Rennison books, Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging, etc. Although it seems not so well written at points, with some confusing metaphors and run-on sentences, and has some gaps where my interest was lost (which later was made up for), the book overall is still one to read or recommend to someone who may enjoy it."
2,very dissappointed,"I had ordered two digital 64 mb and paid for TWO through you from BlueProton. They only sent me ONE. I have contacted them twice requesting the other one, but have never received it. Please see if you can have them complete my order. Thank you."
3,Not bad,"This book isn't bad, it follows the movie pretty well. But it doesn't give huge insights into anything, which is what I'd hoped for.Young men will probably enjoy it well enough. For others that aren't complete die hard fans, skip this and read the Mummy books by the same author instead."
1,disappointed with Amazon's delivery,"I am really disappointed at Amazon.com this time.I ordered ScanDisk Ultra II 512MB in May and after a month Amazon still could not deliver it. Then I cancelled the order (thank god) and ordered another memory card ScanDisk 256MB, which is actually in stock. Still, the estimated delivery time is 11 days after the order time, and I am hoping that Amazon can keep its estimation accurate.Have had very good experience with amazon before, but this time, no."
5,"A CF card. No more, no less.","What do you want? This is a CF card, has functioned well for me. SanDisk is a good brand, trustworthy, and I would recommend this card."
2,"Unreliable, not recommended for sensitive material","I purchased this compactflash card due to the low price of the rebate. I quickly found that it was very ""glitchy"" when it came to data. I had frequent errors formatting the card and transferring pictures were a pain as I found that they corrupt in many instances. I refuse to use this card in my elph for fear of losing irreplaceable images. I only use it for mp3's in my ipaq. I was warned prior to my purchase as many pda users had found sandisk to be.. ""less than reliable."" It has become a dedicated mp3 card due to this."
1,THIS CARD CANNOT BE USED,"After using this card for 4 months, My Nikon Coolpix 3100, can no longer read this card. I took about 300 pictures and having problems. I also have a Lexar 128 MB card with no problem, which I have been using before the San Disk. I sent an email to Sandisk, to see if there is anyway to do a Digital Recovery....It might be economical to buy two 128 Mb cards, if one goes bad, then you have a backup.."
5,Kodak DC280 Zoom,"Several years ago, I purchased a Kodak DC280 Zoom digital camera which came with a 16MB card capable of only 26 high quality pictures. Over time, this proved to be a significant limitation. Although the camera is some what outdated, it still takes excellent pictures. After doing some research, I discovered this card which enables me to take over 400 high quality pictures. This turns out to be way more than I needed but sure is nice having that capability. I have experienced no problems with this card.Pro's: High capacity for such an old camera. Works great.Con's: NoneI would recommend to a friend."
4,Learning.,"This book is one fantastic tool for feeding on the first five books of the Bible, otherwise known as the five books of Moses. There is more readible, understandable and usable in this book than in any five I have read. If you enjoy Bible study you will enjoy this book."
5,A Definite Collage Library Addition,"As a collage artist, I found this book to be great for a beginner or a expert. The photos and precise instructions are excellent. The creative inspiration is remarkable. This a very nice ""starter"" the curious and a great reference for the practicing artist. This book really runs the gamut: paper collage, mixed-media w/found objects, fabric collage and digital. It's a an all-around sampler for someone trying to use collage as a creative outlet but not yet settled on the ""how"" of it. Check out Claudine Hellmuth as well. Enjoy . . . I sure did."
1,Wish I'd never seen it,"Had this frustrating little bugger for awhile but finally had to return it. After months of messing around with it trying to get it to work properly, I found someone at their tech support dept. that told me there are known problems using this with non-intel chipsets. If they would have said this up-front they could have saved me and a lot of other people alot of time and frustration."
2,Beware - It's not well marked that this is a 10Mb adapter not the 100 or 1000 you might think it is,"This thing is ancient!!! It came with the drivers on a floppy - I don't have a single machine with a floppy drive so I ended up searching the web to find drivers for it which was no easy task. I do readily admit I should have read the description more closely to know that this was a 12 year old product running at only 10Mb. Since there are a bunch of 1Gb adapters now on the market I assumed that this one was cheap because it was a 100Mb which suits my needs just fine but to discover that it's actually 10Mb, I was a bit peeved. Other than being slow it worked fine once I was able to find the drivers for it."
4,"Very Good, but wait for new edition","I am taking a course with Dr. Sussman at Washington University in St. Louis this academic semester. We are using this book in addition to other articles he is evaluating for the next edition of it which I believe should be available sometime in 2013. This version is great and addresses a lot of key issues/topics in human evolution and its impact on our behaviour, but if you want the most up to date information and studies I suggest you wait for the new one."
2,A Good Fight,"In Kushti, the comic element was there due to rajpal yadav. the little man skiiny wrestler look arouses a lot of laughter i the audience as well as his actions throughout the movie. Khali makin his debut in Bollywood in this movie is his usual strong and silent self. the only shortcoming was the script and cinematography. otherwise it was a pretty decent movie."
4,Great alternative,I purchased because it works great as a protective sleeve. Has no zippers that could potentially scratch your gun but can be opened up long way on the tail gate of my truck and used as a gun mat or gun can be inserted or removed from the end quickly and easily. Velcro is very strong but I would feel better if there was a buckle. There is one snap ans a second securing mechanism but its in the wrong place for my gun.
3,Novel about the wilds of logging in the Canadian wilderness.,"It was hard to believe that this novel I was reading was published in 1901! It kept thinking that the fiction writers of the turn of the century were very similar to the young adult writers of today.Connor wrote a book which was an accurate recount of life in the Canadian wilderness, and did it in a way that was not offensive in vernacular or boring in content.Truly a timeless novel that your children should read. It very refreshing compared to some of the acidic laced young adult ""literature"" of today. (but they do need some of that to get a perspective on the real world, as it is now)"
3,"Voices From Hitler's Army 2 Disc Set - Blitzkrieg, Luftwaffe, Waffen SS, U Boats, Russia - The Unholy War, Defending Berlin","I bought this for myself and for my roommate, we are big into WW2 documentaries. I thought the price of this was a little steep, but considering the reviews I though it might be worth it. We made it almost the entire way through, but on disc 2 it stopped playing. We tried it in different DVD players, but no luck. We weren't that bummed because it wasn't very informative, and both of us didn't learn anything knew. It would have been worth it if it was 20-30$ but $50... totally not worth it."
4,Excellent,"I was quite reluctant to spend so much money for such a short documentary, but I am now very glad that I did. This documentary contains a great deal of footage I had not seen before, and I have seen most classic and recent documentaries on the Third Reich. The interviews with veterans are moving, and provide a very interesting perspective on the various topics. There are only two drawbacks to this documentary, in my view: (1) there are points where I think a little additional context would really help, and (2) the six hour-long documentaries do not seem to have any coherent overall organization. I am sure some of the WWII fanatics--the ones who are obsessed with having every little detail correct--will find fault with this set, but for me, an interested amateur, it is really enjoyable and informative."
5,Photo Heavy,"This book is wonderful if you're a fan of Kahn's work. The book is unique in that the text is Kahn's original words. However, this book is not really a textbook - it functions more like a coffee table book. It has lots of photos and few words."
3,Nice pics.,"If you are inerested in late modern architecture and the thoughts ""behind the men"", it is a good resource. Lots of bright photos of Kahn's work. The text is a little sparse. but for the price it's a good deal."
4,be careful,like others have said this is for the moosberg 500. the ati heat shield is not nearly as good after a few rounds the clip on part starts sliding off. now if you have an 18 inch barrell or a tactical shotgun (wich is an 18 inch barrell) and you want to mount a flash light or laser etc... it waill not work with the heat shiels like before mentioned in another review. you would have to buy the hand rail with the picatinny rail attached so that your accessories would be connected to the hand rail.
3,Mossberg Heat Shield,This Mossberg heat shield is a nice addition to my Mossberg 88. The installation was a little tricky but looks great on the gun.
3,DOESNT FIT EVERY MOSSBEREG,ITS A GREAT HEAT SHIELD BUT IT ONLY FITS MOSSBERG PLAIN BARRELS WONT FIT THE BIGGER BARRELS WITH A PREACHER TIP IT DIDNT FIT MY MOSSBERG 500 CHAINSAW A GREAT SHIELD FOR PLAIN BARRELS
1,590A1 heat sheild,I do not believe this is an actual Mossberg Heatshield. This heat shield will not fit a 590 at all i ended up taking the part to a gunsmith to have it put on and he had to grind so much metal off the part to make it fit around the barrel it actually caused the metal tab to break off when tightened down. This part is not meant to be used on a 590 at all. The description need to say only for a 500 not a 590.
5,perfect fit,i have tried several other heat shield and could get any to fit my Mossberg 500 Cruiser. this one for Mossberg fits perfect. Can't bolt down but because of snugg fit no need too.
5,One of his best,"Michael Feinstein is one of the best singers I have ever heard. He knows his craft exceptionally well. His respect for the popular composers of the earlier twentieth century keeps alive a lot of songs that are to me vastly superior in quality than anything being composed today. Nice Work If You Can Get It is one of his best. A tribute to the Gershwins, it features a number of interpretations that are original and exceptionally well performed. Listen for the subtle nuances in how he phrases, when he uses the power of his voice and when he backs off and sings a line more gently. He possesses a range of singing techniques that most others lack. Very impressive. Buy this!"
5,Pulls out all the stops............,"Oh, yes!So, if you're in the mood for a pulls-out-all-the-stops, ""Grand Production"" number, you'll find none on any of his DVDs that's moreso than Mikey's rendition of the ""Fascinating Rhythm"" medley.But you can't stop there, oh, no. If what you want (and I so do) is his ""fun-est"" number ever (except, maybe, something from ""Pure Imagination""....and that's just for kids--Ha, Ha), then grab a listen to his ""Anything for You."" If it doesn't stoke your fires for the next month, I don't know what will. (Oh, yeah, the title track's a kick, too).Enjoy!****"
1,DISSAPONTED!!!,"The jersey it self is very nice. Althought I am extremely dissapointed at the ""NO"" customer service! This item was advertised as a size: Toddler 3T. I ordered this product for my 2yr old son. Upon receiving this item, I received a Youth Med 10/12. Way tooo big for my 2yr old son. I contacted the seller ""twice"" asking for a simple exchange...I would just like to have the correct item size they were advertising and what I expected to get when I purchased this item. I am extremley dissapointed, I sent them two emails and have had not one return responce!! I would not recommend this seller to anyone!!!"
3,OK - but this cooler is not as good as it used to be,"I own 2 of these. 1 is a few years older than the other. The older one is GREAT. Coleman changed 2 things in the newer ones.1: the bail handle is more flimsy, and ataches with plastic pins that are weak. If you load it up, expect problems.2: the hinges are also attaced with plastic ""rivets"" which break. Now, it's a 2 piece cooler.I gave it 3 stars because I do like the functionality and it does keep ice OK for a day. Don't expect longevity."
1,not the same old quality,I only used this cooler twice and the lid hinge broke. There is no doubt that this is made much cheaper then models in the past. Now I'm trying to figure out how to get a warranty repair or replacement.Follow up: Amazon sent me a completely new cooler and when I contact Coleman about the problem they sent me 2 set's of hinges for the lid. Great customer service for both amazon and coleman but the cooler is still cheaply made
1,picture and description don't match!!!,"I'd like to order this if I knew which one I'd get! Price suggests the description is right, as the original price is higher than another rug like it.Fan Mats 8233 NFL Pittsburgh Steelers Starter Mat"
5,One Solid Album!,"WB had a unique sound, and ""THERE'S THE RUB"" is possibly their best album. Laurie Wisefield did a great job filling Ted Turner's spot. Hard to pick a favorite track, but ""Silver Shoes"" and ""Persephone"" are just incredible."
4,Did you hear the latest Buzz?,"I bought this for my dog, he loves toys that make noise; as most of the ""dog"" toys are either very ugly or very expensive. I mean for something that he's just eventually going to tear up once he gets excited enough $5 really isn't a bad price to pay. The bee itself is cute and soft (no bean pellets) and it has a small squeezable sound button. It's wings look white in the picture with a shy hue of pink. In person they are more like a bight pink, but it's still cute all the same.A real bee's wings are clear and pick up the colors around them much like a ranbow does, so I guess it's almost accurate."
3,Bumble Bee Toy,"Unfortunately my 2 1/2 year old son didn't like the sound the bee made and he loves bumble bees. Also unfortunately our two dogs did like the sound and decided after having the toy 10 days to chew it up in seconds. The toy wasn't as realistic looking as it could have been, as the eyes were tiny and not where a bees eyes are situated. The bee could have had a proboscis to make it look a little more real."
3,The first time to go outside with kayla!,"Since...this toy is so great!!!When it's raining, i put the rain coat on kayla and kayla really loves her new stroller!But when i'ts summer, all right i take kayla out with her stroller and then i take her to the park, as we started to play tag with her. and i still love her new stroller! But... i got a changeing table, a walker a wodden high chair and a feeding set and... her new CHOU CHOU Baby Clothes! OH MY GOD!!! I LOV CHOU CHOU AND HER NEW ACCERIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Force is Back!,"I enjoyed this ""new addition"" into the ""Star Wars"" universe. Although I must admit it got a little hokey at times. ""Using the the force, Anakin. . . ""With all the mystery the Force presents it gets a little too unbelievable in parts. The ending plot sems far-fetched and sketchy even for an experienced Jedi, but as ""Star Wars"" has proven time and time again, whole empires can fall on far less. I believe George Lucas has to approve the stories that writers submit so it will be interesting to see if any of these details from this story are carried forward into the new movie. (The acquisition of Anakin's Lightsaber being one little detail I would like to see)"
3,Great book for the newbie,"Have you watched the Star Wars movies but left the printed word behind? Many of the Star Wars-related books attempt to fill in the blanks between episodes, and to flesh out the characters. This book is about some of Anakin's adventures at age 13, between Episodes I and II. It may involve the first time he kills a man (a slave trader) with a lightsaber, since he builds his first lightsaber in this book. Could it be that these experiences give you a better insight into why Anakin resists the total obedience required by the Jedi Council?A book for YA, and a fast read. Have fun with this. Other reviews state that this material is covered in large part by other books in the Apprentice series. Since I haven't read any of them, it was new to me!"
2,Lots of Boo Boo's!!,At first glace this pool looked like great fun for my 18 month old daughter. My daughter wanted to play on the slide part and she fell off EVERY time even With help. She is a very good climber but it just wasn't very stable. It is also a very big pain to clean!! End the end it went to the curb and we bought a hard plastic pool with a slide. Bottom Line - BOO BOO MAKER. Save your money.
4,"Fun, but not for long","We read about this pool in the Wall Street Journal, which said it was the most fun plastic pool, so we bought it. It was fun...for the two days it lasted. It was a pain to inflate, came with a hole in it, and sprang another leak the next day. The only person in the pool was my 21 month old daughter, so it didn't get any hard use. We ended up putting it in the trash and buying [a different] self inflating pool. My advice is save your money and buy something more durable, throw in some toys, and enjoy it...for more than 2 days."
4,"A fun ""one-season"" toy","If you have [price] for your kids to have fun for one season, then buy this pool. Fun? Yes! BUT.....it does NOT hold up to much play at all! My 2 daughters (ages 3 & 6) are not ""hard"" on toys, yet I had to return this pool immediately because of a leak....They played with it through the summer season last year, but the second one too started leaking, and by the end of the summer it was put in the trash. If your budget allows for a pool to be used for one season only, then your kids will enjoy this one. BUT...if you are looking for something to endure a couple of years, then save your money!!"
1,Buy a sprinkler at home depot instead...,"Unmanageable to store, deflates easily when you don't want it to - Terrible waste of $$$... My daughter got more fun out of the 3 plastic balls that accompany this, and our sprinkler hooked up to a garden hose."
2,Don't waste your money,"I have always been skeptical in buying blow up pools, but my son who is almost 3 really wanted it. So I got it. It had a hole in it before we even blew it up. We patched that and it had another hole with 15 minutes of play. Don't waste your money. It didn't hold up well at all. The palm tree kept leaning outside the pool. I was very disappointed in it and won't buy another one."
2,Our Pool came with holes cut by manufactures in the sections,"Our pool had several machine cut holes in the corners where the baffles meet. Some had the plastic intact with circular perforations about 1/4 in in diameter. I am upset, because you constantly have to keep adding water to maintain safe level. A Water conservationists' nightmare. Taking ours back, Defective??!! Check yours before you leave the store. Good Luck, Better products out there."
1,Not durable... Shipped with holes,This item is poorly constructed. It never even blew up the first time because it had holes in it.
1,Disappointing Toy,"I was very disappointed. It takes forever to inflate that you just let the kids in the pool since the sun starts going down. The palm trees were flopping over... some chamber walls were marginally inflated so that when water was added, it just ran over the edge. My recommendation is to buy a hard rim pool. Never again for an inflatable. It's in the garbarge now."
2,not as fun as it looks,"I'm a toy enthusiast and this playground pool has a good concept,but needs a lot of improvment. It is too crowded, the water level is very very shallowand the slide is difficult to get on and to slide down. I feel this pool is for very young children due to the shallow water level and limited space. My son is 2 1/2 years old. He likes all of the stuff in the pool, but tries to lay down and swim and is unable. we haven't had any tears or holes, but it has not been used much. It is too difficult to empty and clean for the amount of enjoyment. Also the pool is flemsy. It seems to always need air and the palm trees and basketball goal fall over. We are getting a hard plastic pool and using our own toys. Good Luck...."
4,Fun but does not last.....,"My son (who is 2 1/2 years old) LOVED this pool - along with the neighborhood kids, but it fell apart within a week. The holes were to small to patch. Not very durable."
2,I have not received the catalog,"Today is April 15 and I have not received this catalog that was paid in early March, despite the payment of the airfreight had not a lower rate, it has no service of tranking the AWB. I do not know where the catalog is. I am dissapontied with your mail service."
3,not as good as 'mingo' but same kind of story,Not one of Bannerman's best but would probably entertain a child. A good little girl buys a funny book and is so absorbed she doesnt notice the crowd of hungry tigers gathered around her. But a wise old frog diverts them on the promise of the funny book. The tigers all end up dead and the book proves too heavy for the frog so 'Quasha gave him a saucer of milk which he liked much better.'
2,NO NO NO,"Weak Production , Average Songwriting but decent vocals. Yeh i can hear the 80s influences in this band but it's just not making the grade. The guitar sound is poor and the whole thing just reeks of typical American garbage (and lets face it American music has pretty much sucked since 1992). I mean it's not as bad as bands like Creed or Linkin Park but guys WHERE'S THE HOOK?? I'm not really hearing many memorable tunes. If you want to hear REAL MELODIC HARD ROCK then just buy anything released on the European labels: MTM/Frontiers/Now&Then/Z Records. For example - the new PRIDE OF LIONS album just destroys this. Maybe these guys need to just write better songs and lose that ""alternative"" vibe. Sorry - this is just NOT RECOMMENDED. Gets 2 stars for having a decent vocalist and at least nodding to the 80s. So why should you listen to me?? Maybe because i have been a music collector for 15 years and played keyboards on Michael Schenker's last album...."
1,A Flop,"Compared to other Sicilians, the Taimanov is relatively slow-developing, giving White few immediate targets. At the same time, it is a flexible system, and depending on the move order can readily transpose to the Scheveningen or Sveshnikov Sicilians. I had hoped for some detailed discussions of the concepts behind the opening, as well as explanation of move orders and transpositions. On both fronts I was disappointed. This book is skimpy in verbal explanations, and even the annotations and analysis are pretty bare-bones. There isn't a master index of variations. A major disappointment overall. If you're interested in the Taimanov, a better bet would be Graham Burgess' recent book. It's not that great on verbal explanations either, but gets top marks on the technical side."
5,Great book!!,"I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed reading it. It redminds me of the McNally books. Easy to read, fun and entertaining."
1,A book by a christian for christians,"I have read this book and found it to be well written. My gripes with this book is that it is written by a Christian man of the cloth. He quotes scripture left and right and focuses on religous contents and advice from the bible rather than pure facts.I am not a Christian, therefore I did not enjoy the book. Since I am not a Christian, I cannot even determine whether the book is a good one or not.I suggest that this should be avoided for non-Christians."
1,Tales of frigid wives,"Hey, maybe if these women were ""ministering"" to their husband's needs they wouldn't have to turn to pornography.""I started buying sexy nighties, acting sexier, and suddenly I realized I was bowing down to an idol. ""This book is just full of the whining accounts of frigid wives who blame pornography for their bad marriages. Why is ""acting sexy"" within the bounds of a marriage bowing down to an idol? These women deserve their bitter, lonely, sexless lives."
3,Good for small volumes - don't push it though,"I burned one of these cutters up after about 70 plugs. I was cutting them all at once though, and the tool never had a chance to cool down. This is a good tool if you're cutting a few plugs at a time. Don't expect to be able to use it for mass quantities though."
3,Unfortunate pairing mars Jones's stylish outing,"Collectors Choice Music should be congratulated for reissuing these Joni James treasures. Listeners can realize what a gifted vocalist James was, especially when she performed in the jazz setting. But this twofer presents such an unfortunate pairing that it mars Jones otherwise esteemable performance. In the first album, James is backed by plucking banjos and a Dixieland band for workmanlike reworkings of I'm Looking over a Four-Leaf Clover and Hello Dolly. The second album offers James a superb arrangement and backing by ""West Coast musicians"" who offer Jones a backdrop of dramatic bass, jazz-inspired drums and piano. These tracks are a delight, especially You Came A Long Way From St. Louis, Lullaby of Birdland and By the Way. Listening to this CD is jarring when one goes from Swanee and its dixieland arrangement to the jazzier feel of Fly Me to the Moon."
2,not a great buy,this pool was very small and while the sunshade is a great idea we could never get it to stay on well. So that was kind of useless. I would only recommend if your children are very small.
2,So Much for a Sun shade!!!!!,"The only thing holding this shade on is a small piece of velcro on each end of the blow up part of the shade. If the wind isn't blowing it off, it is swaying to one side itself!!!!"
3,I DO NOT recommend the Sun Shade Pool,"I was extremely disappointed with this pool. I loved the idea of the sun shade(and thats why I bought it), however it came off more than it stayed on. I think it needs something alittle stronger than the velcro to keep it attached to the pool. I also think the top makes it harder for my 3 year old to get in and out of it. As for durability, it lasted one summer with moderate use and that was it. It may be good for smaller children who aren't as active. Thanks for letting me give my input."
2,Waste of money,"We were so disappointed with this pool. The idea of having the sun shade on the top is great, and is what sold us on the pool. The only problem was that the sun shade never stayed on the pool. It is fastened with only velcro and always kept falling off. We also had a problem with the height of the pool. The sides are so high any child under the age of 4 has a very difficult time getting in and out of the pool, which can be very dangerous to the younger children.I would not recommend this pool to anyone."
2,Sun shade does not stay on!!!,"Pool is fine, like any other blow up pool. The sun shade is a joke. I ended up using a queen size sheet draped over four high-back lawn chairs. That worked great at shading out the hot sun.Buy a cheap pool and made your own shade!"
4,Not too bad.,"I ordered this for my son (1 year old) last year and was pleasantly surprised at how big it was. There was plenty of room for him and his 3 cousins, ages 6 months to 3 yrs. We did not get much use out of the canopy that attaches (my son was afraid to go in with it on) but I'm looking forward to getting it out again this year for him to play in!"
1,"topples over, does not hold air","I got this pool for our 16 month old, thinking the sunshade was a great idea. However, the sunshade does not stay upright and with a small amount of wind, topples over. So we scrapped the shade, but still were using the pool but even it would not hold air so we ended up throwing it all away."
2,"OK pool, deflates quickly","The canopy arrived torn, it was impossible to inflate it. The pool stays inflated for about 2 hours. That's sufficient for my 2-year old. I have to inflate it and fill it with water every time she uses it. If you are looking for a pool that stays inflated longer, look elsewhere."
2,Lots of fun... the one time we used it,"I purchased this pool in August of 2008 for my daughter's first birthday party. It was a huge hit - the kids loved it. But when we unpacked it this summer and tried to fill it, we discovered that the pool had developed a leak around the valve, and deflates completely within half an hour of being inflated.The shade worked great for us, even on windy days, but the pool just isn't durable enough to last more than a season. I plan on replacing it with something more sturdy this year."
5,Intex Pool,"This pool went to a group of Medical Missionaries in Zimbabwe, to include my granddaughter, and two other toddlers. They love it as it gives them some relief to their 100 degree, no a/c days. Strong enough to support the adults in play also."
2,I wouldn't if I were you,"A lose/lose situation for you. If you fill it up and empty it everyday, you probably won't be pleased when your water bill comes in. Obviously money is a issue for you or you wouldn't be wasting your time on a 19.99 plastic pool, but rather putting in a nice cement-lined inground swimming hole.If you fill it up once a week and keep it in the sun, your pool will turn into a 100 degree hot tub in the summer heat. Not to mention, the bottom turns all slimy and slippery from the grime created from the heated water.If you fill it up once a week and keep it in the shade, even with the little top, all sorts of junk falls into it, making it a cesspool.Your kids will have more fun and you'll save more water if you buy a sprinkler for them to run through. I also recommend the 1,900 PSI 1.5 GPM 11 Amp Electric Pressure Washer With Hose Reel that you can spray the little kids with to keep them cool."
4,sun pool,With having very light skinned boys I was thrilled to find this. However if the wind was blowing at all the velcrowed top would fly right off. I wish it attatched a little better. But with perfect weather it was fine. It is very sturdy and holds a lot of water. My 5 year old loves it.
3,Don't waste your money!,I was very disappointed in the sun shade-it would not stay on! I would have been better off just buying a cheaper pool without the sunshade since we never got to use the sunshade. It was also very hard to blow up even with a electric pump and a major pain to drain. Save yourself a few bucks and buy a similar one without the sunshade!
4,nice pool but the sunshade ...,"Like many other reviewers, we bought this for the nice and handy looking sun shade .... well, it's been a couple of months now and I had to blow up the top part practically every day to make it somewhat stand up on its own (and this is not the most userfriendly 'blow-up toy')... the pool part is great, big, sturdy, edges not too high ... but the shade is probably going to get the boot since it is more annoying than anything else.Buy a cheaper pool without a shade and invest in a real umbrella if you require shade ....."
2,Shade - Off after the first day!,One the first day the velcro that holds the shade together had come off. We tried everything to keep it on - nothing worked. After giving up hope on the shade we just delt with the pool. The pool itself was ok. After having the pool outside for one day we found it completely deflated on the grass. My four year old was devastated. To save yourself the hassles with this pool I would suggest purchasing something else!
4,Great pool but sun shade useless,"I bought this pool to make sure that my daughter wouldn't burn in the sun, but the shade keeps falling. Otherwise, it's a great pool that will keep your kid busy and cool during summer."
3,"Leaks air, sunshade pretty useless","I have to agree with the other reviewers that the sunshade is pretty useless. It is attached to the pool with 4 round velcro pieces, which cannot stand up to any wind. The pool, as well as one of the sides of the sunshade leaked air the first time they were inflated. If you are lucky and get a pool that doesn't leak air, and you don't bother with the sunshade, the pool is otherwise very cute, and a good size. I am returning mine."
3,Intex Sun Shade Pool,I purchased this pool for my 1 yr old and she loves this pool. It is big enough for a child and an adult to enjoy which is a plus in my book. The sunshade that comes with the pool is absolutely worthless and I read that on previous reviews so I wasn't surprised when I experienced the same issue. Draining the pool is a little time consuming because it has 2 inflatable levels that hold water and when draining you have to maneuver the pool different ways to get all the water out of both levels. Overall the pool is nice but if you are purchasing mostly for the sunshade option than this pool is not the one I would choose.
2,Creative Photo Editing,"I wanted to buy a kiddie pool for my daughter, but I was looking for a product with a cover so she would not get a sunburn. I saw the photo and the reviews and thought I found the perfect pool. When the product arrived I saw the actual unedited photo on the box. The seller decided it would be an easier sell if the girl holding up the pool cover was removed.I blew it up and went to splashing around. The cover swayed all over the place and any hint of wind caused it to fall over. The only way this design could work would be if the pool never lost any air. I have owned many types of floaties over time and each slowly loses air, but unlike those products this rendered the pool cover useless over a short period of time.Everytime I look at the girl inconspicuously holding up the pool from the outside with a smile on her face, it makes my blood boil a little bit. I should return this pool, but the pool part works just fine. I just hate being deceived."
2,not so great,"I wear these headphones at work for several hours a day, and I don't find them very comfortable for extended use. The wire that is hidden in the back plastic piece has begun to slip out in places. Plus, the ear pieces are a little large and shiney in the middle, so I feel like an insect when I'm wearing them."
1,Useless Product,"I would say this is one of the useless product i have purchase. This Product has a little PHILLIPS cloth on the side, which keeps on hurting your neck if you make it down. Although this is portable but its not flexible to use. Sound Quality is good. Chord is very small."
2,If you have a big head . . .,"These seemed like an awesome solution to my headphone needs, but they fell short. I guess I shouldn't have had high expectations due to the price. I love that they collapse for easy storing. They're very light. And they provide decent sound.Unfortunately, they don't adjust for different head sizes - and it's very irritating because they go around the back of the neck. I can't move my head once I have them in the right spot, because then they get caught on my coat, my seat, my collar . . . you get the point. Also, the cord doesn't stay connected to my iPod very tightly.All in all, I don't recommend . . . unless you have a big head."
3,Great sound... while they lasted,"I bought these as a replacement for my wonderful, now completely worn out (and sadly discontinued) Philips HS500s. These weren't quite as comfortable as the HS500s, but as many of the other reviews say, they did have great sound... for the period of time that the headphones worked. About five months after I bought them, the sound in one ear began to gradually fade and within about a month it was almost completely gone. I'm still looking for a pair that is both comfortable and will actually last for over half a year."
5,Awesome quality for price,"I bought these Philips headphones to replace my aging and beat-up Sony StreetStyle headphones. The amount of different in the audio quality between the two is appearant from the moment you put them on. The bass is strong but not overdone like with lower prices Sony headphones - it's a much more full an balanced sound then Sony can do for the price. They also fold up, which is nice as well, and I like the white color (fits in with my iPod that I use these on). Even though I only planned on using these for portable use, I've been finding myself using them at home as well - they just sound so good. You can't get any better for the price."
5,Incredible Sound!,"I never type reviews, but the SOUND on these $12 headphones is better than my expensive headphones. I bought them because my daughter has a headphone breaking habit, so I didn't want to spend a lot. I am SO impressed with the sound quality that I had to put in a review."
3,Pretty good headphones....,"That is, if they'll fit your head. The sound quality was pretty good and they were comfortable. However, they are not adjustable and they are made for someone with a large head. Well, at least a larger head than I have. These would probably work well for a guy with an average or larger-than-average head, but they did not work for me, being the petite female that I am.Pros:-good sound quality (although I'm not an audiophile)-good cord length (a little long for a short person like me)-very secure over-the-ear neckband portion. Would be good for jogging.Cons:-not adjustable. don't buy them unless you have a large head."
3,Nice pair of headphones.....,"....The only drawback is people can hear what you're listening to, even if you turn down the volume half way. Other than that the sound/bass is smooth and almost perfect."
2,Not quite durable enough,"The headphones just aren't well made. I've had 2 pairs have the small black wire that is in the headband fail, usually within a year of purchase. It seems like the wire is not properly insulated for the way it has to be twisted around.Sound is excellent though, I just would rather have some headphones I don't have to replace every few months."
4,"It's ok, but...","It's really small and not all that great for those of us with big heads. Also, the plastic arms that go over the ear are extremely uncomfortable when you're wearing glasses. However, the sound quality is pretty good and it will definately be useful to someone who wants to carry around their headphones but doesn't have much space.Update: After using them for several months, I've gotten used to them. They are still a little tighter than I would prefer, but overall my second opinion would be to take some time to get used to them. (Would upgrade to 4 stars)"
4,great headphones...,The only problem I have with this product is that it slips off my head too much. I think it might be just a little too big for my head and I have a big head. LOL.
1,not good for eyeglass wearers,"Title says it all--very uncomfortable around the ears. Getting phones or glasses on or off often requires taking both off, then putting it back on, depending which is on top."
3,Get a Koss KSC75 instead!,"I bought this Philips headphone to compare with my old Koss KSC75 after reading all the good reviews, and I was quite disappointed with it. The Koss has better sound quality and is much more comfortable than this one. It is also $1 cheaper. I guess I can't expect much for comfort with neckband earphones, but I expected the sound quality to be comparable to the Koss."
4,can U hear me now?,"a very sweet, inexpensive alternative to buds or full-coverage cups. folding storage design works well. (hint: folded, the phones fit nicely in a small eyeglass case of your choosing) truly lightweight; long-wear comfort is okay...but as others have noted, overall design seems to favor folks with heads shaped like guavas. i'm hoping that over time the neckband will stretch slightly to accomodate my more-like-a-coconut cranial profile. regarding sound quality...big bang for little bucks...if audio lacks in any dimension, i'd say you pay a small price for ever-so-slight mushiness in the high range and/or lack of a ear-throbbing hiphop bass thump--but only if that's your preferrred musical inclination."
4,Great Headphones.,"They're quite comfortable, good sound quality, and a great price.Only flaw is that the 4' cord is bit shorter then I'm used to."
4,Great College album,I love this album. It reminds me of my college days (1974) when I saw J. Geils at the Field House of Western Michigan University on a warm summer day with a great girl and her sister as dates!
5,The Card Adapter Needed for a Honda Civic Si,"If you are lucky enough to have a 2006 Civic Si or beyond that includes the navigation system and the corresponding sound card system, then this is the adapter to get - it works flawlessly.You may spend a little more, but, in the end you'll spend less. Other adapters are known not to work in the Si for some reason. So, get it and move on with life. The sound from the card is incredible. Now, with that said, why Honda chose a PC card is beyond me when a simple USB dongle in the console or glove box would have been 100 times easier."
1,Extremely slow,This adapter is slower than my Canon Rebel XT. I measured about 1 MB/sec with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB card - close to the speed of USB 1.1. Do not waste your money.
3,"works fine, but very slow","I bought two of these cards for use in laptops that did not have a CF card slot. Since my camera uses CF cards, I figured this would work well as another way to backup my files. While it does work, the speed is not so great with large files. Backing up even half a gig of RAW files from my camera can take about 5 times as long than using the camera itself.So, I rarely use this anymore. It's handy if I have to get just one or two photos off a card, but for full backups, I use Sandisk's USB CF reader. I can't speak for the multi-card readers they make, but the old CF reader is the way to go if you're looking for the best performance."
5,Works well with Fanuc controls,This product is the the product to purchase to use with Fanuc controls. This adapter fits the card slot that is found on Fanuc cnc machine tool controls.
5,Great for music in a Honda Civic with card-slot behind nav unit,"The gf has an '08 Honda Civic with a card slot beside the CD slot. I bought this SanDisk Compact Flash (CF) to PC Card adapter, and one of these CF cards:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D76L0I use a universal card reader that came with my digital camera to load mp3s onto the CF card shown in the link.It works great. The touch screen on the car's dashboard allows us to browse folders and sub-folders. The card holds thousands of songs. We have lots of our favorite music in the dashboard of the car now."
3,No CF Type II support,"I bought this to use with my Microdrive, but the reader is for Type I CF cards ONLY. other than that, it works just fine."
4,"Great for transferring photos to your laptop, but ...","The SanDisk CompactFlash PC Card Adapter is a quick and easy way to transfer photos from your type I CompactFlash memory cards to laptops and other PCs with PC Card slots. The memory card simply shows up as a hard drive, allowing direct access to copy, move, and delete photos much more quickly than with the typical USB interface provided with today's digital cameras.My only caution with these adapters is that they seem a bit delicate in terms of electronics; always be sure to stop the card services on your PC for the device before removing it from your computer, or the adapter could go ""bye-bye."" I've gone through two in two years (on multiple PCs) due to simply ejecting the card--upon next use, the adapter failed to work. PC Card standards supposedly allow for hot swapping, but something in these cards simply doesn't like being handled that way."
4,"Works, but rough","It's an adapter. It arrived in good condition and it works. The one thing I don't like about it is the textured finish. I sounds like it's abrading the slot on my computer when I remove it. A smooth or brushed finish would have been better in this regard.The only other thing I can say about it is that the SanDisk SDDR-64-768 Compact Flash to PC Card Adapter seems to be the same thing but is currently $10.24, $2.75 less than this one."
1,Don't get ripped off,This item was $14 at the end of January. On Feb. 3rd it was boosted to $19 and the next day to $29. This is probably a selling you want to avoid.
5,Definitive book on International Harvester Trucks pre -1948,"Gini Rice, female author, interstate truck driver from Oregon, has produced three books in this ""Relics of The Past"" series , the other being ""GMC Gems"", and ""Keen Kenworth Trucks"".Fans of International Harvester trucks and truck enthusiasts in general will find this a valuable reference book.Well written, well researched, and plenty of photos with text, this books ends with a picture of a ""modern"" 4370 Transtar on page 167, but really this is only to contrast with the pre 1948 era on the preceding pages. 1946 included of course, the popular and now highly collectable ""Western"". There are three pictured examples of this model.A hard-to-find book well worth tracking down."
4,Not bad....,Ive been using this product for a while now and I must say it does make a difference... I use it on the back of my thighs where I have most of my problem and it does help...
3,Bliss serious seaweed soap supposed be 11.1 oz,The product itself I have no problems about except the fact when I ordered said 11.1 oz bar and I ordered two bars and recieved two 6 oz bars.
4,good country music,THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD AND IM HAPPY JUST TO HAVE FOUND IT FOR SALE - I WISH THERE WAS A LIVE CONCERT OR VIDEOS OF THIS CD ON DVD FOR SALE
5,Very Best . . . Means What It Says,"All his hits, from remakes to originals, epitomize real Country Music! From the sensual boldness in ""Another Night of Love"", ""Sexy Lady"" or ""I've Just Got to Know How Loving You Would Be"" to the whimsical storylines followed in ""Ballad of a Hillbilly Singer"" and ""Legend of Paul Revere"" - Freddy Weller was ahead of his time! An outstanding songwriter and artist!"
1,Book,"This is not the book it says it should be.. This was a darn cookbook.. Doesn't say that in the title.. Book you represent is facts about Kokomo, In Is that why you didn't use a picture?"
2,Not very vista friendly,After purchasing the mouse I noticed it didn't list vista as a compatible O.S. This mouse worked fine at first then after a few days the optical mouse mode quit working. It only worked in presenter or ball mode. I went to their site and downloaded the newest drivers and it worked again but now after a few weeks the optical mode won't work again. The instructions warn that exposing the light sensor on the bottom of the mouse to bright light would damage it. I'm sure that never happened. My office is fairly dark. I will try to reinstall the drivers and the next time I purchase an wireless optical mouse I will make sure it lists vista as an compatible O.S.
1,Not as Advertised,"I need a handheld optical trackball, so I bought this mouse as it is listed as a 'Wireless Optical Presenter Mouse'. But what it fails to state is that the trackball is totally mechanical - not optical. As if that were not bad enough, the trackball is so erratic and twitchy as to be totally useless.I gave this product one star only because I cannot go lower. Definately NOT recommended."
3,Could have been great,"I did quite a bit of research to try to find an alternative to my old hand-held track ball (which I loved but they don't make anymore) and this seemed to be the best of the bunch. I wanted it for comfort while working on a computer all day long. I didn't really need the presenter functions, they were just a bonus. Unfortunately the track ball would not move well to the right (or was it the left? it's been a while). This may have been my particular mouse, but I did not opt to have it replaced. I am still on the hunt to find a decent yet inexpensive wireless hand held track ball."
1,Worked for Approximately a Week,"The mouse hooked up nicely to my Vista PC/TV setup. After about a week of use the roller ball could not function up and down, only side to side. Approximately a week later, I smelled something burning. After I decided that it wasn't my lamp, I then realized that it was the pointer mouse on the table next to the lamp. The mouse was very hot, and seemed about to catch fire. I will be returning the mouse and looking for a better product. I live overseas and purchase many things online and this is my first review that I've ever written. I don't want anyone else to go through the same frustrations that I went through. There is a reason for the price decrease...it's called faulty materials."
4,"Great value, works well.","Nice piece of hardware.2 modes of operation:Mouse mode: when on flat surface, trackball acts like scroll wheel and standard 2 mouse buttons.Presenter mode: Laser pointer enabled, 2 extra mouse buttons are available under mouse.Works fine on XP, although administrator access is needed to get the extra 2 buttons under the mouse recognized. Also works on Linux (Ubuntu) in both mouse and presentation mode, but I haven't gotten into XF86Config or whatever it's called now to get the extra buttons enabled.Also, it's a little narrower than most desktop mice so it fits my hand better.Limiting to 4 stars because I've only been using it for one week."
4,Great gadget,"A great tool for the business professional. This mouse-presenter adds that little touch that makes you more comfortable when giving a presentation - especially if you like to move around and interact with the audience. the look of it has that Sci-Fi feel that makes you just want to use it often, polishing it at the end of the day to maintain that high gloss finish.The movement, control and feel are quite smooth and it fits nicely in your hand.My only critic is that it with the cradle could have been a bit more compact, but what the hey. Still a great gadget!"
4,Works Great!,I've been very happy with this presenter mouse. It has worked well for presentation and as a wireless mouse. It's also great fun to watch the cats chase the laser!
4,good product,"I used this mouse for control a computer that play movies on my TV. Overall, it fit my request very well. It can be used both as a mouse and as a remote control. The tracking ball is OK but not very easy to control and sometimes it is interfered with some other wireless things and do things by itself."
5,GREAT!,This was exactly what my son needed to help with his teaching presentations. He is very satified.
3,"NOT an ""Air"" Mouse","Yes, you can hold it in the air. huzzah. Consider: your table mouse moves the cursor as your hand moves the mouse across the table. This ""air"" mouse does not move the cursor with the movement of your hand whilst airborn. like a composer whose wand doesn't do anything. You need to use the scroll ball with a finger to move the cursor. Kind of like turning an old mouse upside down and pushing its ball around. This should be in a different mice category. I could have flipped my old mouse over and used a slip of paper or something. It would require the same amount of movement and does not achieve cursor movement by hand gesture. If you're that inept at mice use an assistant for your presentation. No need to make redundant technology."
3,"This not a ""Handful of Blues""!","It's too much Blues for me. I like Robben Ford very much, but for me this record is ""overloaded"" with the same well known rhythm. I think ""Handful of Blues"" is much better because it's more relaxed and varied."
5,An Inditement On Time!,"If clocks are just too much for you man, do not eat this book! Your soul is a feminist/muslim and the men have syphilitic rabies on their dogs. We will find the chalice! So do it, girl! A woman without a fish is like a man without a bicycle!"
2,cute but poorly constructed,"As the previous review indicated, this tack trunk is a lot of fun but not well made. Between our two horsey girls, we received three of these for Christmas this year. Two of the three literally fell apart as we took them out of the box Christmas morning. After gluing them back together and letting them dry for 24 hours, they're great. So, if you consider the purchase a kit (to make a tack trunk), at what might be considered a premium price, in the end - it's a good one."
2,Resetting,"There is a problem with this watch and resetting its time. Hitting both buttons on the side causes it to reset to the first of the month at midnight. There is no way for you to correct it in time or day. Basically, you have to wait until the first of the next month at midnight and hit the two buttons again."
2,Do better elsewhere...,"Well, the recipes in here work. They taste like run-of-the-mill takeout Chinese food in a box. There's little discussion of techniques, ingredients, or variations. (In fact, the author warns at the beginning that all the quantities have been carefully measured, and don't even think about changing them!) Vegetarians beware: the chapter entitled 'Vegetables and Tofu' is mostly made of recipes that contain veggies and tofu, but also a hunk of pork, chicken, etc.Save your time and get one of Barbara Tropp's books instead."
4,Beautiful Work.,"I found this book, both the text and photographs to be very useful as a guide. I wished for more Etruscan work is my only regret."
1,Not what I expected,"The chandelier was actually shipped with some parts for the three-light and other parts for the 5 light so it was hard to tell how it might have looked had we had the correct parts. In any case, the metal part was nice but the plastic inserts below the globes looked cheap and the globes themselves were rather large. I thought it was over priced and we returned it due to not have the correct parts to begin with."
4,Sundowner is great!,"I love this CD. The lyrics are great and of course the vocals are too. Anyone who is a fan of the Lawrence arms will love this. The only band i can compare this sound to is fingers cut mega machine. In a world full of horrible music, it is always great to find a new band that is as good as sundowner."
3,Order & arrival?,"Order placed on 9/30/11 and it is 12/22/11 without an issue in sight yet? The 1st ETA was in November, then revised twice before showing 12/18/11....maybe it would be better to say ""pending"" and just receive 1 yr's worth of issues? Hope this shows up in the mailbox soon - especially since it was supposed to be a gift for early December 2011."
5,Scottish Love,"If you like some easy-going music that you can listen to for hours and hours, this is an excellent CD. I normally listen to the harder versions of rock, but on days that I just want to lay back and enjoy myself, I take out this disc. Hope you love it as much as I do!"
3,"Not much to add to ""The Man Who"" and ""The Invisible Band""","Travis is a band best remembered by forgetting all they did before their smashing ""The Man Who"" hit the shelves. Most of their earlier work can be overlooked without missing much, which turns ""Singles"" into mostly a compilation of hits from ""The Man Who"" and ""The Invisible Band"", both of which stand up as solid albums in their own right. My question, then, becomes: why not simply get those two albums and skip this one altogether? You are going to get the true best of the band, plus you will save yourself some time listening to their old-and-not-as-good material."
3,more than enough Travis,"I really can't imagine how anyone is passionate about having all of this band's albums. It's not so much that they're bad, just kind of forgettable. The songs tend to drag along at the same mellow mid-tempo and there aren't too many memorable hooks. Realistically, all I or any other casual listener needs is a CD with ""Sing"" and ""Why Does it Always Rain on Me?"" with a a few random highlights. All of that is on this collection... and then some. Eighteen tracks is just too much when all of the songs have the same kind of adult contemporary, ready-for-VH1 feel to them. And there are other songs on here other than the aforementioned two that are pretty good. The problem is that there is just too much unnecessary stuff on here. At least Coldplay had one decent album; I can't imagine listening to a whole Travis album in one sitting. It's OK though; I think a lot of listeners will upload the two or three songs they like to the mp3 player and take this one to the retail shop."
2,The great alessandra marc dissapoints this time!!!,"I purchased this cd thinking that the performance of the closing scene of salome by allessandra marc was going to be a hedonist delight.I was in for a shock.Allessandra let me down.If she was in bad voice why didn't she just wait till another day to record it.Why does she alloe the releas of such a poor performance.Her tone sounded damaged,the breath and support out of place.The interpretation lazy.She needs to get a little more old shcool and better phrase.I think she needs a workout trainer for the boby to,would likey help her singing immensely.As for the conducting,I wish we could bring conductors like fritz reiner back from the grave atleast he gave this kind of music fire and electricity,and a classical rennaisance sense of style and ethereal beauty!!!!I listened to this entire recording and found it mediorce and dull!!!Love you anyway alessandra. blessed be"
5,"Steps for focusing ideas & writing cohesively, convincingly","Directed primarily at students in high school or college who don't know how to get started in writing a paper, report, thesis or similar project, my college son read it and passed it on. I found it helped enormously with my writing of corporate reports, clear and precise office memos, etc. It's in a chatty, easy to read style but I still found lots of ideas that will continue to be useful in clarifying and focusing what I'm trying to say and getting it down on paper quickly, sharply and without rambling."
4,Whetstone,A quality whetstone with an outstanding nonslip base to hold the stone in place while shapening knives.
5,A Delightful and Thought-provoking Read,What a delightful time I had reading Hungry River!! The writing style of combining Abbie's thoughts with her grandparent's lives as Chinese missionaries made for a unique and interesting read. I usually read right before going to sleep and I found myself going to bed earlier every night so I could read Hungry River and see what Abbie was finding in her 'China Boxes'.This novel gave me a thought-provoking look into the lives of Chinese missionaries. Their selfless serving and endless caring to and for the Chinese people was an inspiration to me. I am hungry for more and impatiently waiting for the next book. Enjoy!
5,A super good book,"Soldat is a book about the story of one young German officer. It covers his youth, his personal accounts of WWII & his captivity after the war. The book was really good. The action was great and Knappe getting bounced around so often due to different assignments was surprising. It was hard to put the book down while reading it. The end of the book moves slower than the rest (from an action stand point) since he is a POW. I would definitely buy this book again!!"
5,Excellent and different account from the 'norm,"This is one you won't put down...I've slogged through quite a few wwii personal memoirs...this one is a winner, buy it..."
3,"Obvious outside influences to ease the ""Allied"" reader","While I enjoyed reading this book and I learned about the dynamics of war from an artillery stand point I truly regret the obvious influence of allied post war morals. Mr. Knappe, our character, keeps a constant pressure page after page on not trusting Hitler, showing great sympathy towards the jews and producing ONCE AGAIN another book that we Americans can digest and say ""see! there were only a few bad apples in the Wehrmacht that supported Hitler"" For once I would like to see a book that explains to me how proud Hitler made a German soldier feel (and obviously he did make them feel like aryan super men), why the fatherland was more important than life itself and why it was ok for them to invade the rest of Europe and have a general approval for the deportation of the jews. This book is just another try to hide the real face of the authentic german soldier fighting for Deutchland and the Third Reich."
5,Sodat: Reflections of a German Soldier,I just finished the book about 5:00 this morning. I had enjoyed it very much.
5,The Potential German version of a Band of Brothers script...,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I know there is conjecture about some of the details, but the book was very interesting, fast paced and personal. I was intrigued at how Knappe lived a charmed life, just missing many tragic episodes on the Eastern Front like the Stalingrad collapse.I recommend this book as a potential script for a future German version of Band of Brothers. Knappe's original formation of friends & colleagues were slowly whittled down in the bitter attrition of battle, plus the story of his imprisonment and repatriation. It would be a riveting series.If you're looking for a quality read...get this book."
4,German officer's account of WWII & Soviet POW camp,"I read this book in the space of eight hours. Although it held my attention, the author's narrative seemed strangely detached from many of the events he experienced. After reflection, I have come to the conclusion that the sterile way in which he recounts the war--and his less than overwhelming assertion that he did not know about the atrocities committed by Germans--has more to do with the German mentality of the time, than with any deception or arrogance on his part. Reading about his idealistic views and actions, one begins to get a sense of how a nation of individuals with similar views could rationalize or overlook acts that they might have individually rejected.Soldat is an interesting account by a very lucky man, that--when combined with other perspectives of the subject--will give the reader not only a deeper historical understanding of WWII, but a glimpse at the German psyche as well."
4,"Insightful, but forgetful","Knappe writes the memoirs of his WWII experiences with the Wehrmacht giving a good general overview of a German in the officer corps. The main problem I have with his recollection of events is his ""shock"" at the actions of both Hitler & the Allies. He claims that France & England declared war on Germany. Of course this is true but Germany was warned prior to the invasion of Poland. Germany forced them to take action. The other ""shock"" was Operation Barbarossa. Surely he either read ""Mein Kampf"" or had discussed it with someone who had. During the war, an English statesman said that ""The Germans will fight to the last bullet then throw down their weapons and claim it was all just a big misunderstanding"". That is what Knappe's views sound like. These points aside, I found it to be a good read."
2,Sanitised,The book is the story of a German artillery officer in the second world war. Perhaps the most interesting part is the account of his time in a soviet prison camp after the war ended. The author describes how he was asked questions for some five years and learned not to implicate himself in anything which would be seen by the soviets as a war crime. The book gives the impression that it has been written to convey a certain message. The author thus talks of the war and distances himeself from the various war crimes.This is not really believable as the way that the germans killed the jews and the communists on the Russian front was the sort of thing that would be hard to hide.The book contains little insight into the way that the german or the soviet army worked in practice. This is perhaps due to the author being injured for a good proportion of the war and doing training for a good deal of the rest. There are better books around.
1,Save your money - don't buy this book,"If you like photos, you will be disappointed with the fuzzy, poor quality black and whites at the end of the book. The author's degree is in criminal justice, and perhaps she should remain in that field. This book has short, choppy paragraphs and a ""messy"" chronology, going backward and forward through time in a confusing manner. The book lacks ""tone"" as if the author cannot decide whether she wants to be scientific or humorous. Worse, the science is not objective and the humor is not funny. The author describes what is going on in Ziggy's head as if it's factual(for instance, if the monkey hates or harbors resentment). Save your money. This is not a good one."
4,Great Product,"We bought this frame to use on our second child. We used a similar one on our first and liked the results so we decided to get another one. The only issue I had with it was that the impression material stuck to the wooden dowel that they give you to roll it out, so we had to use a non-stick rolling pin. Also they don't tell you that the foam like material expands a lot so you have to press their foot or hand in really deep to make sure you can see it when it is done drying. We didn't do a very deep impression with our first child and his footprint is faint but you can still make it out. Other than those issues, it is very easy to use and if you mess up the print you can just roll it up and try again. If I have another kid I will be buying another one of these for sure."
3,Inconsistent quality and questionable customer service,"When I received the product in the mail, I opened the packet to find the clay to be super sticky and impossible to work with. It got stuck everywhere on my hands and there was no way of getting a foot print impression. I emailed customer service and was told they would be sending out a replacement ASAP. Fast forward a week and a half and I never received the replacement. I emailed customer service for the second time and ended up receiving a replacement a couple of days later (I believe that they never sent out the replacement the first time even though they said they did).Anyways, the second pack of clay was SO MUCH better and easier to work with. Apparently, the first pack I received was defective. All in all, it worked out in the end but the whole process was a pain to go through."
3,Just ok,"The frame looks just like pictured. The Blue insert is not as blue as the example or mine arrived faded. The modeling stuff is sticky and you could not use the rolling tool provided. It is also squishy and my one year old insisted on sqeezing instead of just pressing his hand in the stuff. However, this did give me an accurate representation of his curiousity and hand. The product did come with good directions."
3,Not like before,"This footprint kit was very hard to work with. The mold was very, very sticky and hard to form the foortprint. I had ordered one with our first child three and a half years ago, and it was nothing like this. Not very impressed."
2,Meh,"The ""clay"" is seriously hard to use. The rolling pin to flatten it is useless because the clay just sticks to it. Other tips, if you want to prevent the clay from sticking to your baby's foot, you can put some lotion on his/her foot. The oil will help prevent the clay from sticking. Dont wash your hands before handling the clay, the oil on your hands help with handling the clay. If you do wash your hands, you should again use moisturizer on your hands.Really poorly designed clay. Otherwise the other components such as the frame and matte are fine."
3,"Bought the same thing a year ago, and this item is not as good.","I bought this same item a year ago for when my son was first born. I thought it would be neat to do one again for his first birthday to place side by side. I don't like this one as much as the one that I received last year. This one's bigger, and I ordered the one with the black frame, which was supposed to come with a black background. Instead it came with baby blue on one side and pink on the other. I am very disappointed. Now I need to rig it up with black poster board or something else so it will actually match the other one, even though on the picture on the website it shows the black frame with the black background. I was very frustrated. Now that I opened it all the way up I can't return it without cost. I like the item, but don't like that I have to tweek it to make it be what it was supposed to be in the first place."
1,"Cheap frame, TERRIBLE putty.","I don't know why nobody else had this problem, but the putty was impossible to work with! I kneaded it for at least ten minutes, and it was still stiff, like the texture of memory foam. We pressed the baby's foot down as hard as we dared, and it left no imprint at all! I kneaded the crap again for another five minutes, and it still wasn't soft enough to take an imprint. I tried pushing my knuckle into it as hard as I could, and it still bounced right back up -- left no print at all! We'll keep the frame (even though it arrived broken, as others have said), but I'll get some clay or plaster for the print. That putty is impossible."
3,cheap posterboard,"the color poster board for the background is cheap. i wanted to display the blue side for my son's footprint, but it literally faded before my eyes. it was so light when it arrived, it almost looked green. in a few weeks the ""blue"" turned white. i had to tape scrapbooking paper to the poster board to use as the background color for the imprint. the wood on the frame itself isn't very nice either. it was easy, however, to roll out the foam and take my son's footprint."
5,"Pearhead Babyprints Wall Frame with Foot Print Kit, Mahogany","This Pearhead Babyprints Wall Frame with Foot Print Kit was so easy to use. I have twins so I bought two and made their foot prints in minutes. Other reviewers wrote that the clay/foam took ages to dry and never completely dried - I did not have that problem what-so-ever, it dried over night on my dining room table. Only thing I wish I dud was use a cookie cutter around the edges to make it look more interesting rather then just a rectangle. Oh well, looks cute anyway! I would definitely recommend this kit."
5,Easy to use!,"This product was very easy to use and required very little effort. The instructions are clear and are helpful (I noticed a review that a woman rolled the dough too thin, but the directions clearly say not to. Maybe they have altered the directions to help alleviate any problems since she purchased hers). I too had enough left over to make a handprint which I was happy about :) I am so glad to have this keepsake of my baby's adorable little foot."
4,Velcro and hot glue worked better!,"This is a wonderful keepsake. We imprinted our son's foot when he was only a week old and used a picture from his birth.The directions were clear and easy to follow and the mold clay stuff was easy to use. You can smoosh it up and do the imprint multiple times until it looks the way you want it to.However, once we hung it on the wall, the footprint kept falling down in the frame. I ended up using velcro and hot glue and it hasn't budged since."
1,don't do it,"the material is very tacky and will be hard to remove from the included rolling pin. and then once you get the pin off and get a decent flat piece of material, when you go to give the impression, the material will then stick to the hand or foot upon removal ruining the impression, and you have to do it all over again. it was a horrible process."
3,where's the black background?,"I have two frames that I purchased for my two older children that are just like the picture- with a black background for the footprint area. But unfortunately, this product comes with baby pink and blue backgrounds. I had to go out and buy black posterboard in order for the frame to match the others. fyi to those of you wanting the black background."
1,Junk,opened the box and the frame was falling apart had to glue it back together. Just anther cheap product.
5,Great baby gift!,I've purchased this for a few girlfriends as shower gifts and it was a big hit! I've also got one for my dog since this company offers the kits for pets too. It's so easy to put together and looks adorable hanging on our wall. I highly recommend it!
3,"Great final result, but massive pain to do","The imprint part isnt plaster, it's like this sticky clay that sticks to everything-including the rolling pin that the kit comes with to roll it out, as well as the foot you're trying to imprint. I bought 2-one for my baby, one for my dog, both had their feet stick the first few times....like think if you stepped in a wad of gum and tried to pick your foot up-That's what this was like. They need to edit their instructions because the way they suggest you to use it doesnt work."
5,Great customer service,"We bought one of these when our son was born, and one when he turned 1. It's a cute way to show how much he's grown! The second one we bought was damaged during shipping (the glass shattered), but customer service was quick to respond and sent us out a free replacement."
2,Nice idea but not the best quality,"I think the material for the mold especially and for the entire frame is somewhat cheap. I know a couple of people who've been happy with this product but it just didn't work for us. It is tough to do with a squirmy baby and once we did finally get a mold the contrast wasn't very striking--a footprint with ink may look better. Not worth the effort or $, in my opinion."
4,Nice keepsake frame.,"I bought 2 of these frames to give to the grandmothers for Mother's Day from my 17 month old. She has tiny hands, so they fit fine (although I wouldn't recommend it for kids her age with larger hands, definitely designed for infants). My only real complaint though is that the backgrounds that it comes with are either pink or blue. Am I the only mom that's sick of everything being pink or blue? What about green, or yellow, or purple? So I went out to a craft store and bought a sheet of solid scrapbook paper to use as a background instead."
4,Check for freshness,I loved this keepsake frame kit. The first one I received as a present was not usable b/c the clay that came with it was already hard and not pliable. I had to exchange it for another kit. There should be some sort of date on the box to check for product freshness.
3,"Nice, but not cheap","it is easy to have the footprint done, and to set it up.materials well done, but not cheap for me.I like photos very much, so this will not be ""THE WALL PHOTO"", simply another beatfull photoframe.I don't know if would by again...probably as a gift."
4,Beautiful,"I love this! It holds great memories of my son when he was just born. My only problem with this item is that it arrived crack on the side.We decided to just glue it instead of returning it.I am buying one for my sister, which is 5 mths pregnant."
5,Great keepsake!,"I received one of these kits when my son was born and loved it so much that I bought one for my daughter when she was born. They make such a nice keepsake and my son - now almost 4, loves to compare his hand with the handprint of when he was a baby. (We did handprints because we already had footprints.) The kit is so easy to use and I love the fact that I could try over and over to get just the right impression - which with wiggly little hands can be tough."
4,An Exceptional Gift,"Just the thing for a new mother. I have given three of these over the years and the results have always been exceptional and have become a treasured keepsake.As a bachelor, I always find baby gifts a bit awkward. This is the ideal solution to the problem."
4,Sandisk Smartmedia card for Olympus C2020Z,"Of course, this card will not allow panoramic photos. Only the Olympus card will. Unfortunately, the Olympus card is complexly designed to allow panorama; consequently the Olympus card is very susceptable to disaster. If you only delete old photos, and do not re-format the card often, residual data will cause the card to fail. The instruction book does not tell you this. In addition, if you do re-format the Olympus card with a low battery in your camera, it will also bomb. It is therefore best to use a generic (SanDisk has been reliable) card, and save the Olympus card for the occasional panoramic photo. Don't forget to reformat it, though"
1,"HORRIBLE STUFF, HAIR RUINED","This is a hot mess to apply even though I did a test patch and got the hang of dispensing small amounts slowly, it still got everywhere, has a really bad stickiness on everything EXCEPT what you want it to stick to! I tried applying around a hole in the wall under my bathroom sink that a pipe was coming through. This so called GREAT stuff did not stick to the pipe, maybe because the pipe was too cold or smooth or had some condensation, and instead a glob dripped on my hair. I panicked, ripped my gloves off, further spreading the mess, and looked around for acetone and couldn't find it. I had to cut a 4"" section of hair off because of this. I should have left the damn draft because now my hair is a disaster."
4,Happy with this product,"We have used great stuff for years and it has never let us down. Yes, there is a learning curve and maybe a can bought for practice would be wise but it's worth it's weight in gold as far as we are concerned.We have used it for everything from patching holes in hollow doors, crack sealant, outside on our little waterfall/pond project and on and on, the possibilities are endless with this stuff and we make sure we always have a can of it on hand.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because yes, you DO have to use the entire can in one setting but as far as I'm concerned, it's worth the trade-off.I hope they NEVER stop making this product!"
2,Horrible trigger design,"Anyone who uses this knows how unforgiving this stuff is if you get it on places you don't want it, like your clothing. To lessen your odds of keeping clean, they thought of this nice trigger that screws onto the top, that constantly unscrews itself while using it. Then the foam starts shooting out the base of the nozzle all over your hands, floor and clothing. Most of the time I use this I don't have the luxury of keeping the can away from my body. I'm usually on my back shooting up in cracks or whatever. Please redesign this so the damn trigger stays put."
1,TOTALLY WORTHLESS,"Bought an entire case of this to fill in some large cracks in the attic. NOT ONE can worked properly. The stuff shot out the side of the top near the wand but not one drop went through the wand. Got it all over the wood, my hands, my pants . . . . Can't return it if you have tried using every can! Complete waste of money!"
1,Great idea. Poor execution,"Great Stuff is truly a great idea. The problem is that the dispensing method is poorly executed. I now have two completely full cans sitting next to me which are completely useless. After vigorously shaking for over 30 seconds, placing the dispenser on and squeezing slowly the black seals of both cans starting leaking causing all the ""great stuff"" to come out of the seal area instead of the straw dispenser. And this has happened to me more than once.The date code is for April 11, 2013 which is months away.Bottom line: is that this is a worthless product. Great idea, but only if you can actually get the ""great stuff"" out of the awful can."
1,Foam problems,"I had bad luck with ths STUFF. Bought 2 cans and the tops on both broke while attaching nozzle. Had an older can and same problem. Must be some trick to dispesing the STUFF but directions on the can sure didn;t help. Or maybe I got hold of a bad lot? Not sure, but very agitated with the problem and ended up using fiberglass insulation to seal window."
1,incredibly wasteful and environmentally hostile,"Buried in the fine print is the warning ""one time use expected"". That means you buy this giant 16 oz can, use 2% to fill a couple of cracks, it then hardens inside the nozzle preventing you from using the rest of the can - so now you put the entire can, still 98% full, in your ""hazardous waste"" disposal pile.Someone at Dow Chemical must have a wicked sense of humor, not to mention a complete disregard for our environment."
5,"Good product, also use for holes on doors!","This is a good product, granted you have to use it all in one setting. I use this for patching holes on hollow doors on bathrooms, bedrooms, closets, etc. Just fill up the hole with this stuff to where it flows over a little bit, then wait a day or two, sand it down flush with the door (or any surface I suppose) and you can't hardly tell there was a hole, do this before you paint or plan on painting the door! Anyways, good product!!"
1,Not impressed,"Ok, so I get all prepped to fill the crack, put on gloves and all, then proceed to fill the gap. Hey, not bad. Wait, why is it still coming out of the tube? Maybe if I loosed the tube from the can a turn, nope still coming out. How about if I turn it upside down? Nope, still coming out of the tube. Well I'll be, the entire can is going to empty out. Whose brainchild was this? Really? One use per can? How about a clue the next time to develop a product to label it with this handy piece of information? Oh wait, then many people wouldn't buy it.What a disaster this is. Well one thing is for sure, I can now name at least one product I will never, ever use again.What a scam."
1,bad quality,"I had used the product before and was very satisfied with the foam, but in the last three cans that I tried, two of them did not spray. Brand news cans, but the valves seemed to be defective, or the foam had dried on the inside. The foam leaks from the bottoms of the rubber seal, but none through the proper opening. It would seem, that the cans are not being manufactured rightly, and DOW doesn't seem to care."
5,GREAT FOR THE OVER 50 CROWD,This movie like all Neil Simons is very enjoyable and nostalgic too the over 50 Crowd. This is especially true for those of you who grewup in NYC in the 40's and 50's. Even young audiences will get a chance to see what Gradpa went through.
4,A Neil Simon Memory Jogger,"Neil Simon was very astute in his observations when writing this book. The experiences of a nieve young fellow's army induction and training in the final months of WWII. I can readily relate to his sudden exposure to the real world and finding it necessary to ""grow up fast!"". This movie is not really for mothers and grandmothers, but fathers and brothers should find it interesting."
3,"Brooklyn, 1937","This is Neil Simon's mediocre comedy based on his own early life growing up in this Brooklyn neighborhood circa 1937. A fairly large Jewish family live together, and each member has his or her own story to tell. Eugene (Jonathan Silverman) is the main character, a high school boy who dreams of playing pro baseball and seeing a naked woman. Stanley (Brian Drillinger) is his older brother, who dreams of escape, and does so by joining the army. Other members tell their dreams and shortfallings, too. Thus the picture adds up to a lot of little vignettes. Simon has been funnier elsewhere; his aim here seems more directed at sentimentality and nostalgia. No great shakes."
4,The Mountain Never Cries,"I know the expression ""couldn't put is down"" is not original, but that's how it was with this book. So often I had to blink back tears and swallow the lump in my throat as I read. The story of the devasting impact the Tragedy has on a family and the way courage, hope and prayer help them carry on is awe-inspiring."
3,I would recommend this game,"I would recommend this game. It is fun, but a little hard to get use to at the begining."
2,cs sucks,"i collected all the evidence, used all the hints, interviewed everyone and still didn't have enough to convict. i didn't know what else to do so i quit"
3,Too Quick & Too Easy,"I love the CSI games, they don't make enough of them! But this one was too plain jane for me. It was too predictable and I finished in in less than a week. I hated the colors, Like David Caruso isn't washed out looking enough on TV.... and the characters were annoying. If you like any of the other CSI games then I would get this to keep you from withdrawl."
4,About CSI Miami,"CSI: Miami, is a very good game; very challenging and hard. Ithink their are some glitches in the game. I am right now stuck on the first murder and I don't know what else to do."
4,very cool,This is a great game. The cases are fairly intriquite and if you choose expert you will definitely have some fun. Any CSI fan should check this one out. Very easy to use interface and not very complicated to get the hang of.
1,In deep water on a deflating life raft.,"This game could be fun, aside from it's static interface and little animation which can be forgiven due to it's age, if the level dificulties were gradually increased. Instead, the game throws you in the first scenario - that is just as difficult as the last - and you are left staring at the screen for hours stuck and frustrated. Most games start on an easy level and become more difficult as you go along but not this one. This takes all the fun out of it and even after I went online and printed out the step-by-step solution for the first level, it was still daunting and the list was so long. If you can afford to give up a few weeks of your life to this game or you are a genious with nothing better to turn your talent towards, then you could tackle it."
4,Pretty Good,"This game is pretty fun, it made me think a little. I kind of cheated and got help from online, but it was still fun."
1,I have all the CSI games and had high expectations for this one but it was horrible,"This game was nothing like I thought it would be. I have all of the CSI games and this one was horrible. The graphics were horrific. The game kept freezing up and was really slow. Trying to find any evidence was hard because your pointer did not light up like in the other games. When you did find something and tried to click on it, it kept telling you that you needed to use a different tool, even though you were using the correct one. It just seems to have a lot of problems. Maybe there is a patch but since it updates automatically and is supposed to look for patches and other updates after installation, but since one never installed I am guessing there isn't one. This was a regretful purchase. I love CSI Miami. Because of that, I thought that I would really love the game. Never let your expectations shadow reality."
5,Go for the Cats!!!,"This game is really fun! I have it for about 6 years now and It still never get's boring. Rat-a-Tat-Cat is a game you can always play, and I've never met anyone who isn't crazy about this game. This game is really a Must-Have."
5,Can't Get Enough of This Game!,"My kids, ages 8 to 14, could not get enough of this game on a recent week-end getaway. They played it over and over again. It is great fun for all ages. Even adults will find it a challenge to remember their cards if they don't stay focused. The Peek and Swap cards add a fun twist. Don't hesitate to buy this game!"
4,great for math and play skills,"My 8 year old, 3rd grader uses this and loves it. It's a biot young for her age group, but she does like it. It's something we can enjoy together and it's even fun for mom!"
5,Great game for whole family,This game is great. I was a little concerned when I started explaining it to my 5 year old daughter but much to my surprise she caught on very quickly and loves it. I enjoy playing as well. I always like a game I can play with my young children that I really enjoy too. She has to pay attention and remember what cards she has so she really focuses on the game when we are playing. I think that is my favorite part. She is learing to really focus plus she's working with simple adding of numbers. This was a great choice to purchase. I may pick up a few extra packs as gifts. Not a bad gift at all for $10. Really can't beat it.
3,Kids love it,"We are a pretty avid game playing family and were excited to try this game. The description sounded right up our alley, but in reality, the game is pretty boring with only 4 people. Our boys (8 and 6) seem to enjoy it much more than my husband and I; it seems to drag on for a bit. I will say that we pulled it out when we had some friends over and playing with 7 made it much more difficult to achieve a low score, remember where cards were, etc. and thus provided a much better playing experience."
5,Old fashioned family game,This game has been great for both my 4 yr old and 6 yr old (and they can play together without parental involvement). It was the main entertainment for all the kids and adults on our vacation. Easy to port and even the adults asked to play it. It is truly great for all ages that can memorize 3 or 4 cards. I have purchased this for all the 6 yr old birthday parties this year.
5,Rat-A-Tat-Cat,"Rat-A-Tat-Cat is a terrific card game for kids.If you are careful, you can avoid losing cards by putting them in the metal box when you are finished playing."
5,Great table game for kids,Play with my grandkids ages six to nine and they love it. Short time span but uses various skills. Perfect.
5,Fun game,This is a good game to play with grandchildren. I play this with my 6 years old granddaughter and she loves it.
3,"Quick, fun game.","Rat-a-tat Cat is a cute game involving simple math computation, memory and simple strategy. My 5 1/2 year old grandson learned it quickly. I am disappointed by the poor quality of the cards. They are thin and tend to curl. I wonder if older editions came with better quality cards."
5,Excellent earbuds,"These are really great earbuds. Originally I was using the earbuds that came packaged with the 80gb Zune and these are a lot better. I like a very loud bass so With the volume all the way up these sound great. Some songs like Voyager - Daft Punk have a very strong bass and these earbuds don't cut out any of that sound. It sounds great everywhere else so you still get very clear mid's and high's. These earbuds also come prepackaged with a lot of accesories that to tell you the truth, I never used. I bought these in a real store and even without the extras these are still worth the $80. I definitely recommend these earbuds for someone not looking to spend a lot of money but still looking for great quality."
